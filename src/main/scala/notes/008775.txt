Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 62 year-old male
with no known history of coronary artery disease, history of
hypercholesterolemia and osteoporosis who presented on [**7-6**] with substernal chest pain without radiation while
driving.  He denies shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, nausea, vomiting.  He reports some diaphoresis and
tingling in his fingers.  Two Gas-X without relief and went
to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.  At the
[**Hospital 8125**] Hospital Emergency Department initial electrocardiogram
revealed large ST elevation myocardial infarction
anterolaterally.  He received aspirin and nitroglycerin drip,
heparin and full dose of tissue plasminogen activator.  His
chest pain resolved after 45 minutes with decrease in ST
elevations on electrocardiogram.  However, they reported
worsening elevations on repeat electrocardiograms.  He
received increased nitro drip, morphine sulfate with a total
of 16 mg intravenous was given and Ativan.  He also got
Atropine 0.5 mg times one for a heart rate of 56 prior to the
administration of Lopressor intravenous.  Given the increase
in chest pain after lysis he was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] catheterization laboratory for
rescue TCI in stable condition.

In the catheterization laboratory he underwent stenting of
mid left anterior descending coronary artery lesion.  In the
process of stenting two diagonals were jailed one of them was
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied and the out
flow with 80% stenosis residual.  Right heart catheterization
with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18 and MB of O2
sat in the 70s.  The patient was transferred to Coronary Care
Unit for further management.  He was reportedly agitated and
confused in the catheterization laboratory.  Upon transfer,
however, he was alert, oriented times two.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Osteoporosis, hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Lipitor 40 mg once a day, Fosamax once
a week, calcium and vitamin D, aspirin 325 mg b.i.d., zinc,
vitamin C and vitamin E.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives alone.  No children.  Denies
smoking, intravenous drug or ethanol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother died of myocardial infarction at age
52.  Mother had a myocardial infarction in her 60s.  Father
myocardial infarction in 70s.  Family history is positive for
osteoporosis and hypercholesterolemia.  One of his aunts has
diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission temperature
95.9.  Heart rate 82.  Blood pressure 122/70.  Respirations
20.  Oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  In general,the
patient is a pleasant middle aged male in no acute distress
lying in bed.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.
Neck JVP at about 8 cm.  Neck is supple.  No thyromegaly.
Carotid pulses are 2+ without bruits.  Chest clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Cardiovascular examination regular
rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Point of
maximal impulse not displaced.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Two small masses
subcutaneously on the abdomen consistent with small lipomas.
Extremities 2+ distal pulses.  No edema.  Groin with sheath
in place.  Neurological examination was nonfocal.

LABORATORY:  Troponin less then 0.03, sodium 134, potassium
3.3, chloride 97, bicarb 24, BUN 15, creatinine 0.6, glucose
163, white blood cell count 12.2, hematocrit 52.3, platelets
284, CK 3066.  Cardiac catheterization showed cardiac output
of 3.9 and index of 2.2.  Wedge pressure was found to be 19,
SVR 1395.  It showed diffusely diseased proximal left
anterior descending coronary artery, discreet lesions in mid
left anterior descending coronary artery and second diagonal
with other vessels being normal.  The proximal left anterior
descending coronary artery have mild diffuse disease with 40%
focal stenosis just before diagonal one followed by total
occlusion just after D1.  After crossing the lesion with the
guidewire the second diagonal also was occluded.  Left
circumflex and obtuse marginal have no angiographic disease.
Right coronary artery had some mild distal luminal
irregularities, but no angiographic disease.  Resting
hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
filling pressures with RA pressure of 10.  Right ventricular
diastolic pressure 15 and mean capillary wedge of 19.  The
occluded left anterior descending coronary artery was
successfully treated with angioplasty stenting as mentioned
above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit in stable condition.  He was started on aspirin,
Plavix, Lipitor was continued.  He was also started on
Lopressor.  The next day echocardiogram was done and showed
left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 to 40% with mildly
dilated left atrium, normal in size right atrium.  Overall
depressed left ventricular systolic function, anterior distal
septal and apical hypokinesis to akinesis was present. The
aortic root was mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets
were mildly thickened.  The mitral valve leaflets were mildly
thickened as well.  Cardiovascular wise the patient was
continued on aspirin and Plavix, Lipitor and beta blockers.
He remained tachycardic over the next two days with good
blood pressure control.  His lipid panel was done and showed
triglycerides to be 79, EL 44, cholesterol to HDL ratio 3.0
and LDL cholesterol 72.  His troponin was elevated the next
day above 50 and CK peaked at 3066 with subsequent decrease
over the next 24 hours down to 1134.  His echocardiogram
showed hyper versus akinesis.  The need for anticoagulation
was discussed and it was decided that the patient would need
reevaluation of his cardiac function as an outpatient one
month after discharge.

Pulmonary wise, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had lung examination and chest
x-ray consistent with mild congestive heart failure.  He was
diuresed nicely over the next two days after admission with
significant improvement on clinical examination as well as
improvement in oxygen saturation.

Endocrine wise, he remained on his outpatient medications for
osteoporosis.  Hemoglobin A1C was ordered and came back
mildly elevated at 6.2.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the
regular floor on [**7-16**].  He continued to do well over the
next two days without any complaints.  He did not have any
chest pain or shortness of breath.  His physical examination
remained normal.  He maintained good oxygen saturations on
walking and was discharged to home on a cardiac healthy diet
in good condition on his outpatient medications plus
Lisinopril 10 mg once a day, Toprol XL 50 mg once a day and
Plavix 75 mg once a day for twenty eight days.  The patient
was to arrange follow up with his primary care physician.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute anterior myocardial infarction.
2.  Osteoporosis.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
