Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
left hand weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2110-9-18**]:  Right carotid endarterectomy with bovine pericardial

History of Present Illness:
82 yo RHM with h/o CABGx5, bilateral carotid disease (100% left
ICA occlusion and 60-69% right ICA occlusion), and left
hemispheric CVA approximately 18 years ago who presents with
acute weakness of his left arm.  He was at a stressful day of
work (he runs a pharmacy) when he developed left arm numbness at
5:00 pm, rapidly followed by left arm weakness, left leg
weakness and a left facial droop.  He called his daughter and
said he thought he was having a stroke, she immediately gave him
81mg of ASA and called EMS.  Immediately upon arrival a code
stroke was called.

[**2110-9-12**] 05:45PM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01

[**9-12**] NCHCT
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial
infarct.
However, if clinical suspicion is strong, MRI is more sensitive
for ischemia.
2. Left parietal encephalomalacia.
3. Left maxillary polypoid mucosal disease.

[**9-12**] CTA Head/Neck
IMPRESSION: Chronic-appearing occlusion of the left internal
carotid artery.  Mild-to-moderate stenosis at the right carotid
bifurcation with soft plaque involving the distal common carotid
artery. Probable high-grade stenosis of the right cervical
vertebral artery at the V2-V3 junction secondary to
atherosclerotic disease. Intracranial CTA demonstrates
high-grade stenosis prior to the right middle cerebral artery
bifurcation region and narrowing indicating atherosclerotic
disease involving left middle cerebral artery M1 segment.

[**9-13**] MRI Brain
IMPRESSION: Small acute infarct in the right posterior putamen.
Small
chronic encephalomalacia left parietal region. Absent flow in
the left
internal carotid artery. No evidence of mass effect or midline
shift.

[**2110-9-13**] TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 45-50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No
apparent cardiac source of embolism. Moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.

[**9-13**] NCHCT
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation involving the right
posterior
putaminal stroke that is better characterized on recent MR.
2. No acute large vascular territorial infarction.

[**9-15**] Carotid US - 1. No change in occluded left ICA.
2. Approximately 70% right ICA stenosis. This has progressed
since the prior study where this was previously graded as 40-59%
right ICA stenosis.

[**9-20**] CT  Head w/wo contrast -
IMPRESSION:
1. CT head shows no significant change from prior MRI and CT
examinations
which include left-sided parietal chronic subacute infarct in
the right basal
ganglia and atrophy of the right temporal lobe. No hemorrhage
seen.
2. CT angiography of the neck demonstrates postoperative changes
from carotid
endarterectomy. An occluded left internal carotid and stenosis
in the right
vertebral artery are again noted.
3. CT angiography of the head again demonstrates intracranial
atherosclerotic
disease as before.

[**9-23**] Cardiac Cath -
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated native three vessel CAD. The LMCA had moderate
disease. The
LAD was 100% occluded after septals.  The AV groove LCx was
patent with
a 100% stenosis in an OM branch.  The RCA was totally occluded
proximally.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA to be widely
patent
which supplied a small native distal LAD. The SVG to the RCA and
LPL was
totally occluded and the RCA filled via left to right
collaterals.  The
SVG to the OM and Diag was patent with good runoff.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling
pressures
with an RVEDP of 8 mmHg and mildly elevated left sided filling
pressures
with an LVEDP of 17 mmHg. There was normal pulmonary artery
systolic
pressures with a PASP of 28 mmHg. The cardiac index was
preserved at 2.7
L/min/m2.  There was moderate systemic arterial systolic
hypertension
with an SBP of 157 mmHg.
4. There was moderate aortic stenosis with a peak to peak
gradient of 29
mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.1 cm2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native 3 vessel CAD.
2. Occluded SVG to PDA/PLV
3. Patent LIMA and SVG to OM/Diag.
4. Mild LV diastolic dysfunction.
5. Moderate aortic stenosis.
