Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 45yo male with history of CHF, COPD on home O2,
OSA, ESRD on HD MWF, and recent cocaine use who presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED with new onset dyspnea the night of [**2148-2-6**].  Per report
from the ED and [**Location (un) 86**] Police Department, patient used cocaine
earlier that day prior to attempting to break into a [**Doctor Last Name **] to
sleep. When the police arrived, patient reported SOB and was
brought to ED for further evaluation.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] any CP
or recent illnesses.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.3, P 74, BP 151/64, R 24, O2
sat. 92% 4L. Exam notable for rales at right lung base.  Labs
notable for normal WBC, anemia with HCT 30.9, hyperkalemia with
K 5.5, and elevated BUN/Cr of 71/11.4.  EKG showed sinus rhythm
with Q wave in III and TWI in III.  CXR demonstrated right-sided
effusion.  Patient was given tylenol 650mg PO x1,
albuterol/ipratropium neb x1, kayexalate 30mg PO x1, and lasix
60mg PO x1. He was initially admitted to the medicine floor, but
on arrival to the floor noted to be increasingly lethargic. Sats
were dropping to mid 80s on 5L NC, and patient became responsive
only to sternal rub, prompting a trigger for hypoxia and AMS.
Sats improved to 96% on NRB, but given concern for hypoxic
respiratory distress, patient transferred to MICU for further
evaluation.  Just prior to transfer, ABG showed 7.20/72/62/29.
.
On arrival to unit, patient was more awake and alert. He was
very upset, stating he is homeless and does not want to live.
The patient [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] any dizziness, CP, palpitations, fever, or
chills.  Had nausea earlier and reports cough productive of
mucous.
.
Review of systems:
As per HPI.
He [**Last Name (Titles) **] fever, chills, headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea
or congestion. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations,
or weakness. Denies vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal
pain, or changes in bowel habits. Oliguric. Denies arthralgias
or myalgias.

Past Medical History:

exposures.
4. Renal osteodystrophy.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 45yo male with CHF, COPD, OSA, and ESRD on HD MWF, who
presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia in the setting of
recent cocaine use, with CXR demonstrating right sided effusion.

# Hypoxic respiratory distress: Patient's dyspnea was felt to be
multifactorial in nature, secondary to volume overload in
setting of CHF and missed HD sessions, right sided pleural
effusion, and bilateral pneumonia. ACS was felt to be unlikely
etiology of dyspnea and acute hypoxia, in absence of chest pain,
EKG w/o evidence of ischemia, and flat cardiac enzymes. He was
initially admitted to the floor, but subsequently transferred to
the ICU given increased lethargy and worsening respiratory
acidosis/hypercarbia. Patient's sats improved on non-rebreather,
and he became more awake and alert. The patient had HD the
following morning, with removal of ~3.6L and continued
improvement in dyspnea. CT chest demonstrated loculated right
pleural effusion, concerning for parapneumonic effusion and
possible empyema in setting of multifocal PNA. He was started on
broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/levofloxacin given concern
for multifocal pneumonia. Thoracentesis on [**2148-2-8**] yielded ~1L of
serosanguionous fluid, which was sent for cell count, gram
stain, culture and cytology. The patient was continued on BiPAP
at night given history of OSA and chronic CO2 retention, and
also continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed for
dyspnea.

# CHF: Patient's baseline cardiac function unknown. As above,
possible that patient had CHF exacerbation from increased salt
intake and missed HD sessions with volume overload. Imaging on
admission was suggestive that pulmonary edema and bilateral
effusions could be contributing to acute presentation. Patient
was continued on ASA, ACE inhibitor. EKG did not demonstrate any
evidence of ischemia to suggest acute worsening of CHF secondary
to an ischemic event. CEs negative.

# Hyperkalemia: Patient hyperkalemic to 5.5 on presentation,
likely secondary to ESRD. Received kayexalate in ED, with
subsequent normalization of K. He was monitored on telemetry,
and continued on HD M/W/F.

# ESRD: BUN/Cr elevated at 71/11.4 on presentation. Patient had
HD on [**3-14**]. He was continued on calcium
