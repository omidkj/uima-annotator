No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with PMH of severe diastolic heart
failure and atrial fibrillation who presents with 3 days of
shortness of breath, cough, and decreased PO intake. Per her
daughter, she has been decompensating since her last hospital
admission for CHF, 1 month ago and has been living at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab since discharge. For the past 3 days, she has been
increasingly short of breath. She has been holding her food in
her mouth and not swallowing and her daughter noticed swelling
to her right jaw which is causing her pain. She was given lasix
at rehab and had little urine output in the past day. Her CXR at
rehab showed pneumonia so she was given vanc and zosyn at 21:45
[**3-28**] and sent to the ED on a non-rebreather. ABG was 7.54/28/68.
Her daughter states she has not had any documented fevers.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98.7 110 130/86 38 99%. Exam was
notable for crackles on right greater than left. She does not
have good pleth, and was placed on [**6-11**] in ED. Pt has not had a
lot of secretions. Right parotid also enlarged on examination.
Labs showed lactate 3.8, WBC 11.1 with 90% PMN's, Hct 35, INR
3.7, BNP 15,000, trop 0.04, Na 146, Cr 1.8 (baseline 1.1-1.2),
AG 15. Blood cultures were sent. ECG showed AF @ 94, ST dep +
TWF laterally, which is unchanged per report. CXR showed left
upper lobe opacity, right basilar infiltrates and likely some
pulmonary edema. She was given 500cc NS in the ED for elevated
lactate.
VS prior to transfer 92 128/81 94% 20 [**6-11**]. She has 18g right
arm, 24g right hand for acccess.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient appears  uncomfortable and is
accompanied by her daughters. A foley was placed a put out 250cc
concentrated urine.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, unable to obtain additional information at time of
admission.

Pertinent Results:

Imaging:
CXR [**3-29**]:
IMPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia. Under appropriate clinical
circumstances
peripheral consolidation can be seen with chronic eosinophilic
pneumonia.

TTE [**3-29**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen
(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the distal half of the anterior septum and dyskinesis of the
distal half of the anterior wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 45 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION:Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution).
Severe mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Biatrial
enlargement.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-7-26**],
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now
identified.


CT head w/o [**3-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process. If ischemia is of concern, MRI
is more
sensitive if not contraindicated.
2. Small vessel ischemic disease and age-related involution.
