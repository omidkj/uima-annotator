Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
.
Hemodialysis
.
CT T-spine, L-spine ([**9-19**]):
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged osteomyelitis at T7-8 thoracic vertebra
with
retropulsed fragment at T7-8 that causes severe spinal stenosis
and is unchanged.  The paraspinal abscess is also unchanged.
.
CT Chest ([**9-18**]):
IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size in bilateral pleural
effusions.  We do not know the significance of the negative
measurements of the pleural fluid (?fat content) Interval
progression of the osteomyelitis centered at the T7/T8 levels
with increased destruction of the vertebral body of T8 involving
posterior margin with spinal canal  and with apparent fragment
extending into into spinal canal with bony fragments going to
the spinal canal. This could be better evaluated by MR exam of
the spine. Cholelithiasis.
.
MR spine ([**9-18**])
IMPRESSION:
1.  Spinal canal stenosis at the level of L4/L5, appears to be
slightly more severe than the prior study secondary to increase
in disc bulge.  It is probably causing compression of the cauda
equina at this level.
2.  Increased signal in the disc of L4/L5 is unchanged when
compared to prior studies and is likely degenerative since there
is no involvement of the endplates and is stable.
.
RUQ Ultrasound ([**9-17**])
IMPRESSION:
1.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
2.  No evidence of biliary ductal obstruction.
.

History of Present Illness:
64 female with h/o mental retardation, DM, renal failure on TIW
HD, recent hospitalization with epidural abscess s/p laminectomy
and drainage of T11-S1, I&D of foot, drainage of sphenoid
sinues, who was readmitted from [**Hospital3 7**] with
intermittent fevers and back pain. She is unable to give a good
history, but according to her caregiver and the staff at
[**Name (NI) **], she has been complaining of increasing back pain for
the past two days. She has not had fevers in the past week, but
since her last discharge ([**2136-9-1**]) and last week, she has been
having intermittent fevers. She was discharged on oxacillin (for
abscess), levaquin (for UTI), and flagyl (for presumed c.dif).
.
She has also been noted to be intermittently hallucinating and
paranoid since her last admission. She continues to have
diarrhea. Her urination has been improving, and she is still
dialyzed q MWF at [**Hospital1 **]. She complains also of intermittent
abdominal pain. She has not been coughing, denies N/V.
.
ED COURSE: She was febrile to 103, tachy, and requiring
supplemental oxygen. She was given 2L NS, ceftriaxone, and
vancomycin. She got an abdominal / pelvic CT scan which showed
worsening bone destruction at T7,8 retropulsing into the
thoracic canal concerning for osteomyelitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan:
64 female with MMP, recently admitted with MSSA epidural abscess
s/p drainage of paraspinal abscess and laminectomy of T12-L1,
now presents with fever, tachycardia, and increasing back pain,
concerning for improperly treated paraspinal abscess
.
MICU Course:
In the MICU, pt was continued on Vancomycin, CTX was changed to
cefepime. She was on flagyl at the time secondary to diarrhea.
Her urine returned positive for enterobacter which was sensitive
to cefepime. MRI obtained on [**9-18**] showed worsening of
osteomyelitis with new compression deformity of T7 causing mass
effect on the spinal cord at this level. Ortho was consulted
regarding another surgical exploration to obtain more tissue and
determine whether the osteomyelitis has been adequately treated.
Ortho recommended a CT of T/L spine to further evaluate extent
of progression of osteo/abscess, which showed soft tissue mass
at T7 c/w abscess, unchanged from prior CT. ID consulted and
recommend CT guided aspiration and Cx of T7 paraspinal abscess
to determine if she still needs IV Nafcillin. CT radiology
declined to do procedure because of level of abscess. Due to
patient stability, she was called out to the floor.
.
Hospital Course:
1. Fever: Concerning for untreated paraspinal abscess given that
the patient was on IV Nafcillin for an extended course.  Both
orthopoedics and infectious disease following through hospital
course.  Radiology uncomfortable with performing CT guided
aspiration of abscess given the level.  There was a consensus
that the patient should not be put through any further invasive
procedures (such as an open aspiration) to further speciate
source of abscess.  She did get a thoracentesis with the
anticipation that her pleural effusions were communicating with
her abscess, but the pleural fluid was transudative in nature
and did not subsequently grow out any bacteria.  She was
continued on Vancomycin secondary to fevers on Nafcillin, and
this was dosed for a level of 15-20.  When she came in, she
initially had an Enterobacter UTI, and was treated with Cefepime
for this, with a course ending on [**2136-9-26**].  A subsequent UA
showed Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, and she was started on
Linezolid on [**9-25**].  This should continue f
