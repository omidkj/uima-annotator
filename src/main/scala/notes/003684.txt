Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  *7.0 cm  <= 5.6 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%  >= 55%
Aorta - Annulus:  2.5 cm  <= 3.0 cm

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely dilated LV
cavity. Normal regional LV systolic function. [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Moderate global
RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Eccentric MR jet. Severe (4+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS
LV function now appears borderline normal (LVEF ~ 50%). The LV
is now moderately dilated. The RV appears less dilated and its
function is improved compared to prebypass. There is a ring
prosthesis in the mitral position. The MR is now trace. The
remaining study is unchanged from prebypass



Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old whose preoperative transesophageal echo showed
severe mitral regurgitation, and his preoperative cardiac cath
showed normal coronaries.  The patient was felt to be a good
candidate for mitral valve repair. The patient was admitted to
the hospital and brought to the operating room on [**2167-9-8**] where
the patient underwent a radical mitral valve repair with
posterior leaflet (P1/P2) triangular resection with ring
annuloplasty using [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Physio II 30-mm ring and
resection of left atrial appendage. Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. POD #2 the patient spiked a temperature to 102 and
was pan cultured. Central line was removed and tip culture came
back negative. He did have some nausea and liver function tests
and abdominal ultrasound were both negative for a source of
fevers. He was started on Kefzol and continued with fevers over
the next several days. He had multiple blood cultures drawn -
all of which are no growth to date. He was switched to
Vancomycin and infectious disease service was consulted. They
recommended switching to Keflex for a 10 day course. On POD 8 he
had been afebrile x  greater than 24 hrs and sternum was without
erythema or draiange.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 8 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
