History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 36821**] is a 49-year-old male with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heavy smoking who developed
intermittent pain in his right foot three days ago.  Since that

relates a history of intermittent claudication of the right
lower extremity at 1-2 city blocks which is relieved by rest.
He denies any other history of problems with his legs.  He was
seen at an outside institution earlier this morning where he was
started on a heparin drip, and subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Inferobasal LV aneurysm. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No LV mass/thrombus. Low normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Mildly dilated aortic arch. No 2D or Doppler evidence
of distal arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AS. No
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv
injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with
cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.

Conclusions

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is an inferobasal
left ventricular aneurysm. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal
inferior wall and hypokineis of the inferolateral and
anterolateral walls. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular focal systolic dysfunction
consistent with coronary artery disease. Estimated moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 36821**] is a 49-year-old male with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heavy smoking who developed
intermittent pain in his right foot three days ago.  Since that
time, the pain has become increasingly constant and severe.  He
also notes that it feels cold.  On further questioning, he
relates a history of intermittent claudication of the right
lower extremity at 1-2 city blocks which is relieved by rest.
He denies any other history of problems with his legs.  He was
seen at an outside institution earlier this morning where he was
started on a heparin drip, and subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

Strated on heparin drip. Emergently taken to the the endo suite
for angiogram

[**5-9**]

PROCEDURE:  Ultrasound-guided imaging for vascular access,
contralateral third-order catheter placement with abdominal
aortogram and unilateral extremity runoff, infusion catheter for
thrombolysis.

Pt tolerated the procedure well, no complications. Transferd to
the CVICU for further monitering. CBC, HCT, Fibrinogen, coags
followed. CK's moniterd

Pt on TPA drip overnight.

The following day, pt foot looked worse, He was taken back to
endo suite for another angiogram. Upon completion of the
angiogram. It was decided to do furthe exploration.

He was consented.

PROCEDURE: Contralateral third order arteriography with
unilateral extremity runoff, angioplasty of above-knee popliteal
artery followed by stenting for a dissection. The
patient also underwent thrombectomy with export catheter of
popliteal and posterior tibial artery followed by groin closure
with Perclose.

Pt leg was also concerning for compartment syndrome.

PROCEDRE: rle fasciotomies. After relaesing the compartments the
medial aspect was closed, The lateral aspect was left open and
VAC dressing was applied.

To note in each case, Intra-operatively, he was closely
monitored and remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the
procedure well without any difficulty or complication.

Upon completion of the cases on [**5-10**], he was extubated and
transferred to the PACU for further stabilization and monitor
