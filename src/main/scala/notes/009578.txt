Admission Date:  [**2104-6-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2104-6-8**]


Service:  Medicine, [**Location (un) **] Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted to the
[**Hospital1 69**] with melena and
decreasing hematocrit.  She was told that she "passed out"
earlier on the day of admission, but the patient was unable
to further describe this episode.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was tachycardic to
120 with a systolic blood pressure in the 110s.  She was
given 4 units of fresh frozen plasma, 2 mg of vitamin K
intravenously, and 1.8 liters of intravenous fluids.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Recent hip fracture, status post open reduction/internal
fixation.
2.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 45%.
3.  Dementia.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Risperdal 0.25 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Sertraline 75 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Senna.
7.  Colace.
8.  Trazodone 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital1 100**] National
Rehabilitation.  She denies any history of tobacco or alcohol
abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On initial physical
examination the patient's temperature was 96 degrees
Fahrenheit, heart rate was 130, blood pressure was
98/dopplerable, respiratory rate was 22, and oxygen
saturation was 90% on 3 liters nasal cannula.  In general,
she was arousable but sleeping.  She had jugular venous
distention at the angle of her jaw while lying flat.  She had
crackles halfway up bilaterally on auscultation.  Her heart
rate was tachycardic with a regular rhythm, and there was a
2/6 systolic flow murmur.  Her abdomen was benign.  There was
no cyanosis, clubbing or edema of her extremities.  On rectal
examination, she had melanotic stool which was strongly
guaiac-positive.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial
laboratory evaluation, the patient had a blood urea nitrogen
of 43 and a serum creatinine of 0.7.  Her white blood cell
count was 14.4, hematocrit was 24.3 (initial hematocrit on
[**2104-5-10**] was 35.3), and platelet count was 249.  Her INR
was 5.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Given her history of passing out, history
of melenic stools, low hematocrit, and elevated blood urea
nitrogen to creatinine ratio, all indications were that the
patient had a significant upper gastrointestinal bleed.

Given that the patient was do not resuscitate/do not
intubate, her family initially elected to forego an
nasogastric lavage and endoscopy; and instead opted for
conservative therapy.  A transfusion of 2 units of packed red
blood cells was therefore initiated.

After speaking with the patient's sons, however, they elected
to pursue a gastric lavage to evaluate the possibility of a
gastrointestinal bleed.  On attempting to pass the
nasogastric tube, the patient developed epistaxis.  Given her
coagulopathy, this procedure was aborted.  Her bleeding was
controlled.

She did become hypotensive on the floor, and therefore was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further care.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient continued to receive
packed red blood cells, and she was given furosemide
intravenously following the transfusions.  She was also
started on an intravenous proton pump inhibitor.

Early on the morning of [**2104-6-6**], the patient's oxygen
saturation dropped acutely in the 70s.  On suctioning,
red/bloody fluid was suctioned.  Her oxygen saturation
improved on a 100% nonrebreather face mask.  Her arterial
blood gas, however, demonstrated a pH of 7.17, a PCO2 of 45,
and a PAO2 of 50.  A chest x-ray demonstrated worsening
pulmonary edema, and bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates.
She was given furosemide with mild improvement in her oxygen
saturation.

Given the possibility of an aspiration pneumonia, the patient
was started on clindamycin and ceftriaxone empirically.

In addition, the patient was found to have T wave inversions
in the precordial leads on an electrocardiogram, suggesting a
demand ischemia (especially given her tachycardia).  An
echocardiogram done on [**6-6**] demonstrated a decreased
ejection fraction to 25%; it had been 45% in [**2104-4-26**].
There was also evidence of global hypokinesis.

Given the severity of the [**Hospital 228**] medical condition, in
concert with the likelihood of an aspiration pneumonia, as
well as the possibility of a new myocardial infarction, the
patient's sons elected for comfort measures only; and the
patient was then transferred from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit to the General Medicine floor.

On [**2104-6-7**], the patient's troponin had elevated to
23.2.  Given this value, in concert with the T wave
inversions in the precordial leads on her electrocardiograms,
the patient most likely had an acute myocardial infarction
secondary to increased oxygen demand in the face of her
tachycardia.

Given the likelihood of continuing upper gastrointestinal
bleed (hematocrit continuing to decline), recent aspiration
pneumonia necessitating 100% nonrebreather face mask to
maintain oxygen saturations, and evidence of an acute
myocardial infarction by enzymes and electrocardiogram with
an acute reduction of the patient's ejection fraction, the
patient's outlook was grim.

The house staff contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's primary care
physician (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] who agreed with this assessment, and he
also agreed with the plan for comfort measures only.  The
house staff contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's son regarding this plan,
and he agreed with the plan for comfort measures only.
Therefore, the patient was made comfort measures only on
[**2104-6-7**].

The patient continued to receive morphine as needed for pain
and comfort.  She also received Ativan as needed for
agitation.  At 8:15 p.m. on [**2104-6-8**], the house staff
was called to see the patient for declaration of expiration.
The patient had no pupillary response to light, no response
to pain, no spontaneous respirations, no palpable pulses, and
no audible heart sounds.  She was pronounced dead at
8:15 p.m.   Her family members were at the bedside.
