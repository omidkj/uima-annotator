Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated Wenckebach, Mobitz Type I 2nd degree AV block
with 2:1 block given long PR interval, narrow QRS. Pt also has
possible sinus bradycardia with junctional escape rhythm.
.
Patient had Holter monitor done [**12/2162**]
1. Sinus rhythm/sinus bradycardia at rates 42-99 BPM; average 60
BPM. Prolonged AV conduction. Normal QRS and QT durations.
Frequently blocked APBs noted during the 08:00 am hour with 88
pauses between 2 and 2.22 seconds. No longer pauses seen.
2. Moderate atrial ectopy.
3. Trivial ventricular ectopy.
.
Notable for Cr increase from 0.9 to 2.1 and Hct 28 with baseline
36. ED note states TSH 19, but no record in chart.
.
CXR [**8-11**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process; bibasilar
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F with h/o AFib on amiodarone, asthma, dementia presenting
with AV block.
.
#. Cardiac:
a. AV block: Patient presented with 2:1 AV block, c/w with
Wenckeback.  Has a history of recurrent falls, and patient was
deemed to benefit from permanent pacemaker placement.  Patient
was bradycardic into 20s before PPM placement, and HR supported
with dopanine/amiophylline?PRN atropine.  Only reversible cause
noted was amiodarone, which patient was on for AFibb, which was
held.
   Prior to placement, the patient found to be in atrial
flutter.  Patient was planned for concurrent AFluter isthmus
ablation, but was deemed to have ? of AFibb component, and
ablation was deffered.  Patient was restarted on amioderone on
discharge, and will follow up with cardiology clinic.
.
c. CAD: no known h/o of coronary disease; no ischemic changes on
EKG, patient continued on ASA 81 mg. Echo with showed
hyperdynamic ventricle w/o wall motion abnormalities.

#Fevers: Possibility of PNA on CXR with slight elevation of WBC.
 Started on Vanc/Zosyn and completed course.  No fevers, WBC, or
SOB on discharge.
