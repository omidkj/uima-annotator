Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Arm Pain/Abdominal Pain - concern for anginal equivalent

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
73 y/o M with hx of CAD, CVA presents with intermittent chest
pain/forearm pain x 1 week.  The patient was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 838**] in clinic today where he complained ot
forearm/abdominal pain for the last 8 days - these symptoms were
not associated with chest pain. Symptoms were intermittent and
occasionally at rest.  On the day prior to admission patient
notes walking with his grand son and developing medial arm pain
and abdominal pain as well as feeling fatigued. Patient sat in
the air conditioning and rested and these symptoms resolved over
20 minutes. After dinner the day prior to admission the patient
noted another episode with similar symptoms no chest pain,
however also was associated with flushing, diaphoresis and
headache.  The patient reports his prior CAD presented as tooth
pain.  Today he has not had a recurrence of either the forearm
pain or chest pain.  No orthopnea, increased lower extremity
swelling.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.4 58 147/75 16 97.  He was given
325 mg aspirin.  Labs were significant for no elevation of
cardiac enzymes.  EKG showed no ST changes, small q waves in
lateral leads I, II, aVL, consistent with prior.  He was seen by
his outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who requested admission to
[**Hospital1 1516**] service.  On transfer the patient's VS were HR 56 BP 159/73
RR 17 O2 95% on RA.
.
On the floor this morning patient denies recurrence of symptoms
and feels well.
.
On review of systems, he denies any deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Studies:
Chest PA/Lat: FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest
were obtained. Lingular atelectasis/scarring is again noted. No
new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
seen. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The cardiac
silhouette is not enlarged.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2190-6-1**]
COMMENTS:
1- [**Date Range 18583**] complex and high-risk PTCA and stenting of the
culprit
distal RCA ulcerated, thrombotic culprit lesion with a 3.0x15 mm
Promus
DES complicated by distal RCA dissection, treated with placement
of
three (2.5x8, 2.5x12 and 2.5x12 mm) overlapping MiniVision
stents distal
to and overlapping with the Promus stent and proximal dissection
treated
with an 3.0x12 mm Vision BMS proximal to and overlapping with
the Promus
stent. Final angiography shwoed excellent results (see PTCA
Comments).
2- Vagal event related to urinary retention treated with
placement of
Foley catheter and supportive care
3- Brief hypotensive event related to # 5 and hypovolemia
4- Small and stable [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] venous hematoma (noted following
urgent
placement of venous sheath for RHC).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. [**Name (NI) 18583**] PTCA and stenting of the RCA with total of 5
overlapping
stents (see comments for details)
3. Integrilin for 18 hours (renal dose)
4. IV rehydration
5. Plavix 150 mg po dialy x 2 weeks then 75 mg daily for minimum
of 12
months
6. ASA 325 mg indefinitely
7. Secondary prevention of CAD
.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2190-6-1**] at 3:11:21 PM
Focused study to exclude effusion: The left ventricular cavity
is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac catheterization ([**6-4**]):
1. Limited coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel disease. The left system was not
injected.
The RCA had a proximal hazy 30% stneosis representing uncovered
dissection from prior case, patent stents in the mid to distal
vessel
with TIMI 2 flow, subtotal 90% occlusion of the distal AV groove
RCA
into the major RPL, and a 50-60% stenosis in the proximal to mid
RPDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal central
pressures with a
systolic pressure of 127mmHg, diastolic of 59mmHg, and mean of
84mmHg.
3. Unsuccessful attempt to wire the true lumen of the RPL
secondary to
residual dissection from the previous catheterization. Final
angiography
revealed a 90% residual stenosis in the RPL, a grade III
dissection in
the RPL, and TIMI 2 flow. (see PTCA comments for details)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Unsuccessful attempt to wire the true lumen of the RPL due to
residual dissection from the prior PCI procedure.
4. Supraventricular tachycardia.
.
ECHO [**2190-6-8**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ven
