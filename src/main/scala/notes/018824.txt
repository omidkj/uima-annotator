.
CT Head
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is
identified. This study cannot exclude an acute ischemic process,
especially in the posterior fossa, and if there is clinical
concern for this issue, further evaluation with an MRI/MRA with
diffusion- weighted imaging should be obtained.
.
MRI/A Abdomen
IMPRESSION:
Normal renal MRA. Simple cysts in right kidney, no focal
lesions. No change in high signal in posterior segment of right
liver, which at that time was thought to represent post-biopsy
change.
.
MRI Head:  F
Fidings: There is miminal periventricular hyperintensity of the
white matter adjacent to the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. There is
opacification of the right frontal sinus. Otherwise the study is
normal. There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass
effect, or infarction. However, no diffusion images were
performed. If there is a concern of venous ischemia, a repeat MR
should be performed to obtain diffusion images. The MRV
demonstrates a normal appearance of the dural sinuses. The
inferior sagittal sinus is not seen, but this may be a normal
observation on MRV.
.
MRI C-spine:
IMPRESSION: No abnormally enhancing lesions of the cervical
spine. Mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine as
described above.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypertension:  In the ED, he was started on a Nitroprusside
drip with resolution of his symptoms. He had no ECG changes and
ruled out for MI.  Initially he was restarted on his home dose
of Lisinopril 40; Clonidine .3 mg patches (2 qwk) along with
HCTZ and Norvasc were also started.  On the floor, the patient
expressed a strong desire to get off the patches and back on to
Clonidine pills--despite excellent BP control.  He stated, "I'll
forget to change the patch but I won't forget my pills".  During
his admission, Clonidine patches were slowly weaned off and his
pills restarted.  The patient had problems with intermittent
hypotension secondary to starting of methadone while in house
(see below).  On the day of discharge, his blood pressure was
stable on clonidine 0.1 mg PO TID. He will follow-up with his
PCP as an outpatient Regarding secondary causes for his
hypertension, MRI of Kidneys were negative for RAS.  His TSH was
normal.  He did not have any stigmata of Cushings Disease and
random AM cortisol normal.  His primary care doctor can consider
further workup of Pheochromacytoma or Hyperaldosteronism as an
outpatient.

2) Headache:  Thought to be a combination of clonidine/narcotic
withdrawl, along with hypertensive emergency.  Had numerous
studies to evaluate the headache including: Head CT (negative
for bleed), head MRI (negative for stroke, mass), LP (CSF not
c/w meningitis), MRI C-spine (negative), CRP wnl (making
temporal arteritis unlikely. His headache had resolved at the
time of discharge, and he was advised to follow-up with
neurology as an outpatient.

3) Opioid Abuse:  The patient stated he was using methadone he
got on the streets.  He was also making "fetanyl tea" as
described in the social history.  He was started on methadone as
there was concern of ?opioid withdrawl contributing to his
headaches.  He was seen by the addiction service and will
follow-up with a methadone clinic as an outpatient. At the time
of discharge, he was on methadone 30 mg PO qAM and 40 mg PO qPM.

4) Gait disorder:  Despite being "ataxic" while being walked by
PT, he had several completely normal neuro exams.  He was
slightly orthostatic, which was felt to be due to his methadone.
 Of note, several nurses documented that patient being
completely independant to the kitchen and bathroom.

5) Microcytic Anemia:  indicies normal, including B12, Fe
studies.  Given h/o microcytic anemia, Hemoglobin
electrophoresis was sent, which is currently pending at time of
discharge.
