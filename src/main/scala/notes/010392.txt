ICD discharge

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 67 year old man with history of CAD s/p inferolateral
MI, CHF (EF <20%), s/p ICD for primary preventions followed by
VT episodes s/p ablation presenting with ICD firing. Pt was
recently admitted after having his ICD fire.
Today pt reports that his ICD fired x1 this evening. Pt was at
rest, had prodrome of fluttering and burning in chest [**3-20**] secs
before ICD fired. Had 1.5 hrs of chest and neck tightness
following ICD fire, typical for him post-ICD fire, which was
resolved on arrival to ED.
During his prior admissions ICD was interrogated by EP and
showed episodes of fast VT with CL 300-320 msec with similar
morphology, some of which responded to ATP while others required
shock. Felt likely to have scar mediated VT from an inferior
origin. At this time there were no signs or symptoms suggestive
of an acute ischemic trigger, and patient was continued on his
home meds of ASA, statin, beta blocker, and ACE-I. The ICD
setting was changed from burst to a more agressive sequence, and
his sotalol was increased from 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 160 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt
discharged on [**6-28**].
.
On arrival to the ED his initial vital signs were T 98.4, HR 81,
BP 156/95, RR 18, O2 sat 97% RA.
.
He underwent an attempted VT ablation on [**2179-7-1**]. However the
catheters could not be passed through the aortic valve. He was
recovering well from the procedure. However, the patient
experience recurrent VT with appropriate shocks at ~430pm. He
was evaluated by the EP service. He was bolused with amiodarone
(150mg), and lidocaine (200 mg) and transferred to the CCU. Also
prior to transfer his pacer was decreased to VVI at 40 bpm to
limit V-pacing.
.
On arrival to the CCU he is without serious complaint. He has
mild chest discomfort following the shocks. He has no shortness
of breath. He has some ringing in his ears following the
lidocaine infusion.


On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Occassionally snores,
but no witnessed apneas. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion with 3 flight of stair, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.  \

EKG [**2179-6-28**]: Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V delay. Left
atrial abnormality. Intraventricular conduction delay. Inferior
infarct, age indeterminate - may be old. Q-Tc interval appears
prolonged but is difficult to measure. Nonspecific ST-T
abnormalities. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since previous
tracing of [**2179-6-26**], ventricular ectopy absent.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2179-6-30**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning/akinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the
anterolateral wall. The remaining segments contract well
(suboptimal technical quality). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be quantified. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-6-5**],
the left ventricular cavity size is smaller. Regional and global
left ventricular systolic dysfunction is similar (was regional
on the prior study and global LVEF was underestimated.) LVEF
30-35%.

LEFT LENI [**2179-7-2**]: Findings consistent with a left-sided common
femoral artery AV fistula. No pseudoaneurysm.

CT PELVIS W/WO CONTRAST [**2179-7-5**]: 1. Aneurysm of the left common
iliac artery. 2. No evidence of AV fistula.

LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION [**2179-7-7**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 2 [**Month/Day/Year 12425**] coronary artery disease.  The LMCA and LAD

showed no significant angiographically apparent cad.  The LCx
had a 70%
proximal stenosis and a 100% mid-stenosis with left to left
collaterals
to the OM2.  The RCA had a 70% proximal stenosis and a 100%
mid-stenosis
with left to right c
