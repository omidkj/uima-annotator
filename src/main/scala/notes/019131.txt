Service:  C-MED

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain, shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 85 year-old woman,
a resident of [**Hospital3 **] with the history of
coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.  She
has no prior history of intervention into her coronary
arteries, who developed and acute onset of chest pain and
shortness of breath around 11 P.M. the night of admission.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] where she received aspirin and sublingual
nitroglycerin en route.  In the emergency department her
electrocardiogram revealed deep around [**Street Address(2) 5366**] depressions
laterally and in the precordial leads the chest x-ray was
consistent with some pulmonary edema.  The patient received
Lasix 40 mg intravenous times one and Captopril 25 mg times
one.  Patient also received another sublingual nitroglycerin
after which her blood pressure dropped to around 60 systolic
for several minutes.  The patient remained with her baseline
mental status throughout.  She was given approximately 500 cc
of normal saline after diuresing for her hypotension.  Her
blood pressure increased to around 100 systolic.  Patient
described onset of her substernal chest pain with radiation
to the left arm, shortness of breath, no nausea, vomiting or
diuresis.  At baseline she has positive three pillow
orthopnea and positive lower extremity edema.  However,
possibly both of these have been worsening over the past few
days.  The patient was still complaining of mild chest pain
in the emergency department and she finally received 0.5 mg
of intravenous morphine to which she responded well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease, status
post myocardial infarction in [**2183-9-9**].  2) Congestive
heart failure.  Patient has history of ejection fraction of
20 percent on echocardiogram in 8/[**2183**].  She has severe
global right ventricular hypokinesis.  She also has severe
left ventricular dysfunction.  On a Persantine median in
[**9-/2183**] she had reversible inferior defect in the apex which
was again not intervened upon at that time.  3) Patient has a
history of hypothyroidism.  4) Chronic urinary tract
infections.  5) Osteoporosis.  6) Choledocholithiasis, status
post papillotomy.  7) Status post appendectomy.  8)
Tuberculosis.  9) Colonic pseudo obstruction.

b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 80 mg p.o. q. day,
Levoxil 25 mg p.o. q. day, potassium chloride 20 mg p.o. q
day and multivitamin 1 p.o. q. day, Axid 150 mg p.o. q. day,

q.h.s., Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. q.h.s., Remeron 30 mg p.o. q.h.s.,
Plavix 75 mg q day and Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a [**Hospital3 **] resident.
She has been Do Not Resuscitate, Do Not Intubate for some
time now and her health care proxy is her son who lives in
[**Name (NI) **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission her blood
pressure was 156/52, pulse of 82, respirations 30, saturation
96 percent on 3 liters.  She is afebrile.  Generally she is
pleasant, alert and oriented and in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:  normocephalic,
atraumatic, extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx moist.
Neck:  she had jugular venous pressure around 10 cm.  Lungs:
she had a few crackles anteriorly.  Cardiac examination:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 with II/VI systolic
ejection border at the left sternal border.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, distended, obese with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  she had about 3+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Her extremities were warm, however, pulses could not be
palpated.

LABORATORY DATA:  At time of admission her white count 5.9,
hematocrit 37.0, platelets 207.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.1,
chloride 100, bicarb 30, BUN 19, creatinine 0.8, glucose 205.
Her cardiacs were normal.  Her initial CK was 85.
Electrocardiogram with [**Street Address(2) 5366**] depressions in lateral and
precordial leads.

HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service for possible coronary ischemia.  She had her cardiac
enzymes cycled.  Her second CK came back at 412 with an MB of
16.  At that point patient was started on heparin drip.  She
was continued on her aspirin and Plavix and beta blocker.
The patient had a history of medical management in the past.
However, this issue was readdressed with the health care
proxy, her son in [**Name (NI) **] who at this point decided that
cardiac catheterization is preferable from his standpoint.
She was catheterized on [**6-7**].  At that time it was noted
that she had an occluded LAD which 99.9 percent occluded with
faint collaterals filling from the distal LAD which was
stented.  She also had 95 percent large left circumflex to OM
lesion which was also stented and her RCA was totally
occluded which was not intervened upon.  The patient
initially did well after catheterization and returned to he
floor with stable vital signs.  However, later in the evening
she developed increasing abdominal pain, hypotension with
systolic blood pressure decreasing to the 70s.  The patient
was also noted to have tachypnea and hematocrit acutely
dropped.  On examination she was found to have a large firm
area on her lower abdomen.  She was sent to stat abdominal CT
which showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.  However,
it did show an intra-abdominal hematoma tracking from her
right groin at the site of the catheterization as well as a
small hematoma in the right groin.  She was transfused and
the patient remained stable overnight after that with her
blood pressure increasing appropriately.  The following day
the patient's hematocrit remained stable and the patient
continued to have abdominal pain for which she received
intermittent intravenous morphine with good relief.  Her
lipids were checked and she was noted to have an LDL of 171,
HDL of 51 and total cholesterol of 254 at which time she was
started on Lipitor.  Her beta blocker had been stopped on the
night of her episode of hypotension when her hematoma was
observed.  It was restarted again on [**2185-6-8**] when the patient
did well.  She also had an ultrasound of her right femoral
artery which showed evidence of a small pseudoaneurysm
measuring .92 x .92 cm with no evidence of arteriovenous
fistula.  Surgery and vascular surgery were consulted who
felt that at this time there was no need for thrombin
injection and that the pseudoaneurysm would most likely
resolve on its own.  The following morning on [**6-9**] the
patient had an episode of bradycardia and hypotension at
around noon with her heart rate decreasing to the 30s and her
systolic blood pressure remaining in the 60s to 70s despite
intravenous fluid for approximately an hour.  The patient was
also transfused for a unit of blood.  Vascular surgery was
called.  We had a stat bedside ultrasound which showed that
the pseudoaneurysm was actually resolving.  She was sent down
again for repeat stat abdominal CT scan which showed that the
intra-abdominal hematoma was actually smaller in side and the
pseudoaneurysm had likely thrombosed and the patient was
transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for observation.  The
patient did not require any pressors while in the Cardiac
Care Unit and her pressure and hematocrit remained stable
overnight.  She was then transferred back to the floor where
she remained stable.  Her Lopressor continued to be followed.
Of note, also while the patient was in the Cardiac Care Unit
there was an episode where she had a headache and some
difficulty speaking and some left arm weakness.  They got a
stat head CT which was negative for events of bleed or acute
stroke.  Her symptoms resolved within a few hours and
neurology was consulted.  Neurology noted that she had no arm
weakness or difficulty speaking at the time of their
examination and it was felt that most likely event was
consistent with transient ischemic attack in the setting of
hypoperfusion
