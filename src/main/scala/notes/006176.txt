The patient's white blood cell count decreased on antibiotic
therapy from initially 7.0 to 9.7 on the day of discharge.
The patient remained afebrile while in house and the
antibiotics were changed to po Levofloxacin for a fourteen
day course following the day of discharge.  The patient's
Coumadin was restarted on postoperative day number two given
the patient's severe apical akinesis and low ejection
fraction.

The electrophysiology service was also consulted while the
patient was in house as there had been a discussion of
revising the wiring of his ICD.  It was decided to not
undertake this while the patient was in house given the
possible infection of the device and the patient was
instructed to follow up with the electrophysiology service
toward the end of [**Month (only) 116**].  The patient overall continued to do
