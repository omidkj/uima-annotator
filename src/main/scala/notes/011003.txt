[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 66152**] was seen initially in clinic and had her pre-operative
work-up prior to surgery. Ms. [**Known lastname 66152**] was a same day admit and on
[**1-13**] she was brought directly to the operating room where she
underwent a mitral valve replacement. Please see op note for
surgical details. She was transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation and
awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Her chest tubes were
removed on post-op day one and all Inotropes were weaned off by
this day. She was then transferred to the cardiac surgery step
down unit. B blockers and diuretics were initiated and she was
gently diuresed during her post-op period towards he
pre-operative weight. Epicardial pacing wires were removed on
post-op day 2. On post-op day three she developed a episode of
rapid atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone was initiated, Lopressor
increased. She continued to be in atrial fibrillation during
most of her post-op course and was started on Heparin with
conversion to Coumadin. And will be discharged with both
Amiodarone and Coumadin. On post-op day three she was also
transfused 2 units of PRBC's secondary to low HCT and had a
decent response. On post-op day four she developed right sided
facial erythema which was warm to touch and c/o tooth
tenderness. ID and dental were consulted, blood cultures taken
and empirically started on Clindamycin. Blood cultures revealed
Staph COAG negative bacteria in one vial consistent with a skin
contaminate. Her WBC slowly trended down. Coumadin continued to
be adjusted for her atrial fibrillation with a target INR of
2.0-2.5. Ms. [**Known lastname 66152**] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home with VNA services on postoperative day 10. She
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist and
primary care physician as an outpatient.
