# Asthma exacerbation: Diffuse wheezing, poor air movement, and
peripheral eosinophilia was suggestive of an acute asthmatic
exacerbation, likely in the setting CAP per CXR results. Initial
peak flow was less than 200, suggestive of severe obstruction.
She was briefly in the MICU on q3 duonebs for control. She was
started on systemic steroids. Did not require intubation or
NIPPV. CXRs suggestive of CAP so 5 day course azithromycin was
started. She was transferred to the floor after 1 day.

systemic glucocorticoids, and Z-pack. Fluticasone 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]

f/u in the [**Hospital1 18**] asthma clinic. She will complete Z-pack, and
