96% on 2 liters.  Generally, the patient is in no apparent
distress.  Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and

LABORATORY DATA:  5.8 White blood cell count, hematocrit
37.5, platelets 206.  Sodium 137, potassium 4.3, chloride
100, bicarbonate 26, BUN 27, creatinine 1.2, glucose 99.  CK
205, troponin 3, albumin 4, total protein 6.8, total
bilirubin 0.4, ALT 3, AST 51.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 80, normal PR,
normal QRS, normal TC, and true [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6192**], new Q wave in
V1 to V3, biphasic T waves in V2 to V4, no ST changes.  Chest
x-ray:  Right middle lobe opacity, question congestive heart
failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
showed three vessel coronary artery disease, moderate
systolic and diastolic ventricular function.  The patient
also underwent echocardiogram which showed that the left
atrium is mildly dilated, left ventricular wall thickness and
cavity size are normal.  Moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease,
proximal left anterior descending.  Minimal aortic stenosis,
mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation and
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

On hospital day #3, the patient was taken to the Operating
Room with the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, unstable
angina, aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, hypertension
and hypercholesterolemia.  The patient underwent coronary
artery bypass graft times two, left internal mammary artery
to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal.  The patient also had an aortic valve
replacement of #21 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] permanent
pericardial valve.  The patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit after the operation.  Mean
arterial pressure was 51, central venous pressure of 7, PAD
of 26/11, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] of 18, rhythm was normal sinus rhythm with a
rate of 75.  The patient was on pressure support with Neo at
0.75 mcg/kg/min.  On postoperative day #1, the patient was
extubated.  The patient had three packed red blood cells and
was started on Amiodarone for ectopy.  The patient was also
on insulin drip for glucose control.  The patient's
temperature maximum was 100.9, rhythm was normal sinus, blood
pressure 136/62, sating well.  The patient was net positive 6
liters.  White count was 12.5, creatinine 1.1.  The patient
was started on Lopressor of 12.5 b.i.d.

On postoperative day #2, no major events.  The patient
remained afebrile with stable vital signs, weaned off all of
the drips.  On postoperative day #3 the patient was in atrial
fibrillation in the morning.  The patient was continued on
Amiodarone for the atrial fibrillation, the patient remained
afebrile with good pressure.  The patient was net negative by
400 cc.  White count was 10.5, hematocrit 30 and creatinine
1.4.  The patient's chest tube, left side, was removed.  The
mediastinal tube was continued as the patient had persistent
air leak from the medial chest tube.  Then the patient was
transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day #4, the patient was back into sinus and
remained afebrile with stable vital signs, taking good p.o.
and making good urine.  The patient's chest tube was put on
water-seal and x-ray was obtained which showed small apical
pneumothorax.  The patient's wires were removed and he was
continued on physical therapy.  On postoperative day #5, the
patient had a temperature of 101.3, otherwise was doing well.
The patient creatinine was up to 1.6, the patient's Lasix was
stopped.  I obtained a chest x-ray which showed a stable
small apical pneumothorax.  On postoperative day #6, the
patient had a temperature of 101.3, white count 8.6,
creatinine 1.5.  The patient's chest tube was clamped and we
obtained the chest x-ray which showed stable apical
pneumothorax.  On postoperative day #7, the patient's
temperature was 99.8, he was doing well with white count of 9
and creatinine 1.4.  The patient's chest tube was removed and
we obtained a chest PA and lateral which showed he had a
trace apical pneumothorax.  The patient, however, also had
crepitus under the skin which was felt.  On postoperative day
#8, the patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient continued to have crepitus under the skin.  Chest
x-ray was obtained which showed the patient was stable apical
pneumothorax.  On postoperative day #8, we obtained another
chest x-ray which showed that the patient's pneumothorax was
stable.  The patient was discharged home in good condition.
