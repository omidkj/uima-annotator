Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
acute shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left heart catherization, coronary angiogram.
Coronary artery bypass x 4(LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,SVG-PDA-,SVG-DG) on
[**2109-1-16**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47774**] is a 70 year old female who presented to [**Hospital1 2519**] on [**2109-1-7**] with acute shortness of breath after
arrival for a podiatry appointment. As per the patient she was
reportedly non-compliant with her cardiac diet over the
holidays. Upon arrival in the [**Hospital1 **] ER, her O2 sats were found
to be in the 70s and she was found to be in pulmonary edema. The
patient was started on bipap, given diuretics and oxygen with
prompt improvement in her symptoms/oxygen status.  In addition
she had a rise in her cardiac enzymes. Given her cardiac history
of known 3 vessel disease she was transferred to [**Hospital1 771**] for furthur work-up.  A subsequent
cardiac catheterization revealed 3 vessel disease, left main
70%, mid lad total occlusion, circ 70%, rca 50% at site of prior
stent.  She was referred to cardiac surgery.


Past Medical History:
hypertension
obesity
s/p carotid endarterectomy
Hypercholesterolemia
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus
Depression
Arthritis
Prior cerebellar CVA (residual balance issues)
coronary artery disease

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco

use, but she has a 60 pack year history (stopped 10+ years ago).

There is no history of alcohol abuse. As per patient's family
patient is very obese and depressed and is not doing much for
herself these days.

Family History:
Brother with CAD and MI age 50 and Father with MI age 50. Mother
with DM.

Physical Exam:
Admission:
VS - afebrile, P 61, R 20, BP 156/76, 95% 2L, FS 176
Gen: obese female in NAD. Oriented x3. disheleved in appearance.

HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor
or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.
Neck: cannot assess JVP secondary to body habitus, no obvious
bruits over carotids bilaterally, supple
CV: RR, normal S1, S2. No m/r/g. No thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.

Chest: CTAB to anterior auscultation only, no crackles, wheezes
or rhonchi.
Abd: + BS, obese, soft, NT. Cannot palpate the Abdominal aorta.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits. Site is c/d/i.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.


Pertinent Results:
[**2108-1-12**] - Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the apical septum, inferior wall, anterior wall,
and true apex. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressedl (LVEF 45-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with mild regional left ventricular dysfunction
consistent with coronary artery disease. Elevated LV filling
pressure. Impaired relaxation. Small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-31**],
regional dysfunction appears less extensive with a corresponding
increase in left ventricular ejection fraction. A small
pericardial effusion is now present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47774**] is a 70 year old female who presented to [**Hospital1 2519**] on [**2109-1-7**] with acute shortness of breath and was
transferred here for catherization. There has been progression
of her triple vessel disease: Left main 70%, mid LAD total
occlusion, circumflex 70%, right coronary artery 50% at the site
of her prior stent.  She was found to have a bump in her cardiac
enzymes and was treated for myocardial infarction.  She was
started on ciprofloxacin for a positive urinalysis.
On [**2109-1-16**] she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times
four.  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in critical but
stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  intubated
  Epinephrine and neo synephrine were started for low cardiac
index. Pressors were weaned off on POD 1 and she was diuresed
and extubated for 12 hours.  Due to increased work of breathing
and hypoxia, despite BiPAP.

Diuresis was continued and she was extubated again on POD 7,
successfully. Diuretics were continued with a fall in BUN and
creatinine and improvement in oxygenation. She had [**1-12**] blood
cultures from [**1-22**] positive for coagulase negative staph. Two
urine cultures and two sputum cultures were negative and
vancomycin started on the 13th was stopped on the 19th.

Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 109471**] renal function stabilized at baseline and the renal
service signed off.  By post-operative day 15 she was ready for
discharge to rehab.
