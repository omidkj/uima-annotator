Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
58yo F with COPD on 3L at baseline who presented with right
sided CP with radiation to the back that began when she woke up
this morning. Her pain got worse throught the day and pleuritic
in nature (worse with inspiration). Pt has felt dizzy whenever
she attempted to walk today. Also reports chills, shivering, and
HA. Pt called Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] who was concerned for PE, PTX, or
dissection and sent her to the ED. Initial ED vitals: 100.2 110
112/65 18 95%. While in the ED, she became hypotensive to the
80s. Initially, pressures did not improve with 2L IVF. Bedside
FAST was negative. A right IJ was placed. CVP was measured at
[**3-4**] and she got another 2L IVF with improvement of pressures to
the low 100s (total 4L given in the ED). CTA was negative for PE
or dissection. Given new RLL opacities, she was given 750mg of
Levoflox.  She never required pressors. She got morphine x 1 for
pain. Per the ED, she transiently desatted to 73% on 6L
approximately 30mins before ICU transfer; per nursing report,
this occured in the setting of having recieved 4mg of morphine.
Currently, T100, 98, 102/68, RR 22, 93% on 6L.

On the floor, pt still feels "lousy," but somewhat better than
before presentation to the ED. Having some cough since volume
resucitation in the ED.

.
CXR [**2185-8-16**]: Severe emphysema with new bibasilar ill-defined
opacities which may reflect infection or aspiration.
.
Echo [**2185-8-17**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2183-5-20**], pulmonary pressures can now be quantified and are
in the mild range. Right ventricular size is mildly dilated with
preserved systolic function. Left ventricular regional and
global systolic function is normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
58yo F with COPD on 3L O2 at home who presents with pleuritic
right CP and new RLL on chest imaging.
.
# PNA: On presentation, fevers, leukocytosis with left shift,
hypoxia, and infiltrates on CT and CXR. She was initially
covered with vanc/ceftriaxone/levofloxacin for CAP requiring ICU
admission. Vanc was stopped after a few days after pt had become
afebrile with no fever spike. Urine legionella negative. She
completed a 5 day course of levoflox and continued on CTX. Prior
to discharge, she was switched to cefpodoxime for a planned
total 14 day course (to end [**2185-8-29**]). Pleuritic chest pain
improved; patient not requesting PRN pain medication prior to
d/c. Supplemental O2 was weaned as tolerated, 90-92% on 6L at
the time of d/c.
.
# Afib with RVR:  Pt developed afib with rates in the 140s/150s
with chest discomfort, no ischemic EKG changes.  Required
digoxin load, but converted back to sinus and dig was d/ced.
Felt to be [**2-2**] stress of PNA. Pt in NSR in the 70s-80s at the
time of d/c.
.
# COPD: Uses 3L O2 at baseline. Increased Advair to 500-50.
Iprtroprium nebs q6 hours, held Spiriva, can resume this upon
d/c.
.
# Flash pulmonary edema: One time occurance. Given Lasix
intermittently. Echo did not show any major abnormalities. Upon
d/c would give Lasix PRN to keep Is and Os even, but no need for
standing diuresis.
.
# Delerium: Pt developed visual hallucinations during her ICU
stay. Does not use EtOH, but does take a fair amount of BZDs and
Vicodin at home, particularly at HS. Poor sleep during her
hospital course. ICU delirium vs. Benzo withdrawal. Mental
status at baseline and resolution of hallucinations prior to
d/c. Pt should resume her home dose of Klonopin upon d/c. She
may continue Zyprexa at HS PRN.
.
# OSA: CPAP at night with home settings.
.
# CAD: Con't simvastain
.
# Smoking cessation: Continue nicotine replacement.
.
# HTN: Held lisinopril in the setting of diuresis, can resume
upon d/c.
.
# Chronic pain: Continued home gabapentin. Held home Vicodin
given AMS and hallucinations.
.
DNR/DNI (confirmed with pt, she has discussed this with her
psychiatrist)
