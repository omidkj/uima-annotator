Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
70F with COPD on home O2, presented to OSH with shortness of
breath, now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory failure.  Per
family, has shortness of breath particularly with exertion at
baseline, only able to ambulate several feet.  This was
significantly worse today.  Daughter does not think she used her
CPAP last night due to falling asleep in chair. Had mild
nonproductive cough, no fevers/chills/GI symptoms.  Daughter
also notes she has had some falls at home and noted an egg on
the back of her head.  Yesterday she complained to daughter of
having difficulty holding things.
.
At [**Hospital3 3583**], O2 sat 81% on RA.  Given lasix 40 IV,
solumedrol 125 mg, levaquin 750 mg IV.  Also noted to have
minimal STEs inferiorly and heparin thus started, received
SLNTG, 5 mg lopressor, ASA 325 mg PR. Received calcium,
kayexalate, insulin/D50 for hyperkalemia (6.3) with new ARF
(creatinine 4.7).  NIPPV trialed but ultimately required
intubation.  ABG 7.12/119/181/41 on bipap.  WBC 13.4 with 12%
bands.  BNP 277.  Did have BP drop to 70s at OSH, responded to
250 cc bolus.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.5 P73 BP 93/49, 100% O2 sat on
vent.  SBP remained in 90s-110s.  Trop 0.04 here; ECG faxed to
cards who did not feel c/w ischemia and recommended d/c heparin
gtt.  CXR obtained with ?RUL pneumonia.  Patient was given vanc
and aztreonam here.
.
On the floor, patient intubated and sedated.
.
Review of systems: unable to obtain as patient is intubated and
sedated.  Positives per family as above.  ALso noted
constipation yesterday.

Brief Hospital Course:
70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with
shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Family gave history of pt
being more tired and lethargic x few days PTA, perhaps due to
hypoventilation.  Patient with severe COPD at baseline,
presenting with hypoxia and ABG showing acute on chronic
respiratory acidosis.  Thought to be due to worsening
obstructive disease vs. fluid overload vs infection, or
intracranial process causing central respiratory depression, as
patient's family reported pt had recent fall.  CT head negative
for intracranial abnormality. Patient was intubated and placed
on a ventilator given her severe CO2 retention. She was
initially treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl for
suspected respiratory infection.  She was given one dose of
solumedrol 60mg, then started on prednisone 60mg PO daily and
standing albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments for
suspected COPD exacerbation.  CT chest showed an irregular
consolidation in the RUL suggestive of infection vs malignancy.
Patient was placed on repiratory isolation in order to rule out
TB.  A bronchoscopy was performed and BAL was sent for gram
stain, AFB, culture and cytology; AFB was negative.  Sputum gram
stain was positive for gram positive cocci in pairs. Urine
legionella antigen was negative.  Patient's antibiotics were
scaled back based on sputum to only levofloxacin on day 2.
(which she completed a 7 day course) The patient was weaned off
the vent and extubated without difficulty on [**2131-1-19**]. Her
prednisone was tapered dow
