Discharge Labs:

Microbiology:
[**1-30**] Urine Culture:  PROTEUS MIRABILIS.    >100,000
ORGANISMS/ML..
[**1-30**] Blood Culture: NGTD

Imaging:
CXR [**2190-1-30**]:
1. Lucency projecting over the left hemithorax, question
elevated left
hemidiaphragm versus herniation of intra-abdominal contents.
Correlation with a lateral radiograph is recommended.
2. Apparent widening of the mediastinum, most likely related to
patient
positioning and technique. This can also be further evaluated
with a PA and lateral view.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with h/o dementia who was found to have severe
hypernatremia and acute renal failure resulting in altered
mental status/delirium. Her hypernatremia was due to poor access
to free water in this demented elderly woman with impaired
thirst and LASIX TREATMENT. She had no evidence of central or
nephrogenic DI. Her free water deficit at admission was 7.6-9.2L
(depending on whether her water is 50-60% of her body weight).
She was corrected with D5W and [**2-6**] normal saline for
conservative management. On [**2-2**], she was switched back to D5W
because of slowed correction. A picc line was placed for better
access and ease of blood draws given need for close monitoring
of electrolytes. Her sodium on discharge was 147. She will
receive additional IV fluids for 24 hours and then oral
hydration of 1500 ML/ Hour. Her delirium/altered mental status
was from her hypernatremia, dehydration, UTI, ARF, and abnormal
mental status at baseline. Per daughter, the patient has
nonsensical speech at baseline.  Her mental status improved back
to baseline over the course of her hospitalization. The
patient's creatinine was increased to 2.4 at admission (baseline
Cr 1.3-1.7. Her renal function improved to baseline with IV
fluid rehydration given for hypernatremia correction. Lisinopril
was initially held and then restarted on [**2-2**] when renal
function at baseline. She received Ceftriaxone for 5 days for
UTI and urine culture grew proteus mirabilis and MORGANELLA
MORGANII. She will receive Bactrim and Augmentin for additional
3 days. Her Foley was discontinued on discharge. She had
hypertensive urgency but no emergency. Lasix was stopped and
should NOT be resumed. She received Lisinopril and Norvasc for
HTN treatment. She may remain hypertensive at NH but no evidence
from radpi reduction of BP woith IV medications unless emergency
(end organ damage). She was initially NPO except for medications
given poor mental status. She had a speech and swallow
evaluation that showed aspiration of thin liquids. She had a
repeat speech and swallow eval when sodium normalized and she
was able to have thickened liquids.
