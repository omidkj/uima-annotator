.
Abdominal US [**2150-2-9**]
1.  Reversal of normal portal flow.  No evidence of portal
thrombus.
2.  Echogenic, small shrunken liver, with ascites.  Focal liver
lesions in this echogenic liver cannot be excluded on the basis
of this study.
.
TIPS placement [**2150-2-9**]
1.  Transjugular intrahepatic portal systemic shunt placement.
However,little  flow through the TIPS after the procedure.  Most
flow still through the significantly dilated varices and
spontaneous splenorenal renal shunt.  The sheath was left in
situ for further evaluation at the next day.
2. Unsuccessful attempt to sclerose varices arising from the
portal and splenic veins with absolute alcohol.
3.  Successful ultrasonographic guidance paracentesis with
withdrawal of 3000cc of ascites.
.
TIPS revision [**2150-2-10**]
1.  Successful reversion of transjugular intrahepatic portal
systemic shunt with reduction of a pressure gradient between the
portal vein and the right atrium.
2.  Successful embolization of coronary vein varix.
.
Abd US [**2150-2-11**]
Patent TIP shunt with velocities ranging from 30-130 cm/sec.
There is a focal area with lack of wall-to-wall flow in the mid
TIPS, which should be reevaluated by repeat study tomorrow.  If
this is persistent, possibility of a clot within the TIP shunt
must be considered and hence short- term reevaluation is
necessary. A large coarse echogenic liver without focal lesions.
 Ascites.  Gallbladder sludge.
.
Liver US [**2150-2-13**]
1.  Trace amount of perihepatic ascites, insufficient in size to
safely mark a spot for paracentesis.
2.  Large coarse echogenic liver, without focal lesions
.
Chest XR [**2150-2-16**]:
There is an endotracheal tube, whose distal tip is at the level
of the clavicles.  There is a right-sided central venous
catheter with the distal tip in the SVC.  There has been
interval placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube with the distal tip
projecting over the pylorus.  The inflated balloon of the tube
is in the fundus of the stomach.  There is a stent seen within
the right upper quadrant consistent with the TIPS. There is
complete opacification of the left lung with volume loss in this
region.  This may be secondary to large pleural effusion versus
consolidation. The lateral half of the right chest has been
excluded from the study.  There
is vascular congestion in the visualized portions of the right
lung.TIPS revision [**2150-2-16**]
Embolization of varices arising from the splenic vein using a
total of 38 coils (the varices rise from the coronary vein and
two branches of the splenic vein). Balloon dilation of the TIPS
with a 10-mm angioplasty balloon. Significantly increased flow
through the TIPS and decreased variceal flow.
.
Abd US [**2150-2-18**]
Patent TIPS with velocities ranging from 52-206 cm per second.
Note is made of interval increase in velocity within the distal
aspect of the TIPS.  Continued short term surveillance may be
appropriate.
.
Chest XR [**2-19**]/-6
1.  Interval development of right upper lobe collapse.
2.  Stable-appearing left lower lobe atelectasis and collapse.
3.  [**Last Name (un) **] tube seen within the stomach.  The balloon is not
identified.
.
CT abdomen: [**2149-2-26**]
1.  No evidence of intra-abdominal bowel pathology.
2.  Decompensated liver failure with portal hypertension and
ascites. Patient is status post TIPS placement and variceal
coiling.
3.  Splenorenal shunt.
4.  Air in bladder reflects an indwelling catheter.
.
ECHO [**2150-3-3**]
Trace aortic regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
.
Chest XR [**2150-3-7**]
There is a left-sided central venous catheter with distal tip in
the proximal SVC.  This is unchanged in position.  There is a
feeding tube identified with its tip below the gastroesophageal
junction.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
There are low lung volumes secondary to poor inspiratory effort.
 There is again seen bilateral pleural effusions and a left
retrocardiac opacity unchanged.  Pulmonary vascular markings are
prominent consistent with mild-to-moderate edema which is also
unchanged.
.
Left upper extermity US [**2150-3-12**]
There is no evidence of DVT.
.
Chest XR [**2150-3-12**]
Improvement in appearance of the right lung likely related to
partial resolution of pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly is still
present and there is still evidence of CHF.  Unchanged
retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
41 yo man with DM, HTN, Alcoholic cirrhosis with new variceal
bleed admitted on [**2-7**].
.
#. GI bleed: In the MICU the pt continued to have hematemesis
despite octreotide and protonix iv but an initial EGD did not
show any active bleed therefore further sclerosing was deferred.
Due to extend of the both esophageal and gastric varices an
urgent transjugular intrahepatic portal systemic shunt was
placed on the [**2150-2-9**]. Wh
