Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Pt initially presented for blood transfusion and HD. She became
acutely tachypneic requiring transfer to the ICU. In the ICU,
she was hypotensive and treated for urosepsis with 7 days of
Meropenem. On the floor, she was stable, and finished pre-op
evaluation for MVR/CABG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2182-1-29**]  MV repair ( 28mm [**Company 1543**] CG Future Ring)/CABG x5 (LIMA
to LAD, SVG to PDA, SVG to OM2 sequenced to SVG to OM 1,
sequenced to SVG to DIAG)/ closure ASD


History of Present Illness:
61 yo F with kidney and pancreas transplant presented to the ED
after missing her dialysis appointment today. She was found to
be anemic to Hct 20, but asymptomatic. She was transfused 2
units of blood with plan to dialyze tomorrow, but this could not
be obtained as an outpatient. During the transfusion, the
patient became tachypnic and febrile, but TRALI was ruled out.
The patient was transfered to the ICU for monitoring, where she
was found to have a UTI and hypotension concerning for a septic
picture. The patient was treated with a 7 day course of
Meropenem. While in the hospital, the patient was evaluated for
MVR and CABG. She is due for surgery on [**2182-1-29**].

INDICATIONS FOR CONSULT:
Investigation of transfusion reaction

CLINICAL/LAB DATA: Ms. [**Known lastname 17759**] is a 61 year old female with
history of
failed renal transplant and chronic heart failure who was
admitted due
to missed dialysis. Due to low hematocrit, she received two
units of red
blood cells with the first unit beginning at 1700 on [**2182-1-18**].
Transfusion of the second unit began at 1820 with
pre-transfusion
vitals of T=97.8, HR=70, RR=20, BP=95/57. Transfusion was
stopped at
2100 after 275cc of the second unit had been transfused, and her

temperature went up to 100.3F degrees with concurrent dyspnea.
No other
symptoms were noted. She remained febrile overnight with Tmax of
102.0
at 0815 on [**2182-1-19**]. As she was also found to have increased
white blood
cells in the urine, she was empirically treated for presumed
urinary
tract infection. A chest Xray on [**2182-1-18**] revealed moderate
pulmonary
edema. She was therefore placed on ultrafiltration overnight
with 1.5L
of urine output and improvement of her respiration. A routine
clerical
check revealed no clerical errors.

Laboratory date:
Patient ABO/Rh: Group AB, Rh positive (both
pre-/post-transfusion
samples)
Red blood cell product (#04x[**Pager number 17780**] - second unit):Group A, Rh
positive
Post-transfusion plasma: Yellow, DAT negative

Transfusion history:
Previous non-reactive red cell transfusions: 19
Previous non-reactive plasma transfusions: 8
Transfusion restrictions: Leukoreduced, irradiated
Transfusion reactions met: Yes

DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 17759**]
experienced a
temperature increase of 2.5 degrees F with concurrent shortness
of
breath toward the end of her second unit of a leukoreduced
compatible
red cell transfusion. Laboratory data revealed no evidence of
hemolysis. Given the short duration of the patient's fevers, a
febrile
non-hemolytic transfusion is a potential explanation. Although
her
fevers may also be attributed to a urinary tract infection. Her
respiratory distress is likely related to volume overload from
transfusion of two units of red cells over a relatively short
period of
time. The patient was at risk for circulatory overload with
chronic
heart failure and the delay in hemodialysis. The resolution of
her
respiratory distress after good urine output is also supportive
of
volume overload. No change in transfusion practice is
recommended at
this time for this patient

TEE [**2182-1-29**]:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage.

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium.

A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %). The LV
is globally hypokinetic with the anteriolateral wall more
hypokinetic than the remaining segments. The estimated cardiac
index is depressed (<2.0L/[**Month/Day/Year **]/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle.

There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened and
retracted. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is flow reversal
in the two pulmonary veins interrogated.

The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened.

There is no pericardial effusion. There is a left sided pleural
effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room.

POSTBYPASS:
The patient is A paced on milrinone, epinephrine and
norepinephrine infusions. There is a well seated annuloplasty
ring in the mitral position. There is residual mild MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] and
mean gradients across the valve are 4mmHg & 1mmHg, respectively
with a cardiac output of 4.1L/m by thermodilution. RV function
is improved
