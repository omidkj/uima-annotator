HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old Spanish
speaking insulin and hemodialysis dependent woman who
presents as a transfer from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for chest
pain and short of breath.  The patient initially presented on
[**2191-9-26**] with dyspnea and leg pain which apparently was
chronic.  Upon admission it was thought she was volume
overloaded and therefore the next day she was dialyzed and 6
kilograms were removed.  At that time she was also started on
Heparin and ruled out for pulmonary embolism with a CT
angiogram which was negative.  After she was dialyzed her
oxygenation improved but shortly afterwards her oxygenation
saturation dropped to 70% on room air and she became
hypotensive to the 70's.  She was volume resuscitated and
started on Dopamine.  Afterwards the cardiac enzymes were
positive for Troponin of 13, CK of 116 and MB of 13.5.  At
that time she developed mild neck pain while patient's
Heparin was restarted and the patient was prepared for
transfer to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization.

During the entire admission there were no significant
electrocardiogram changes.  After speaking to the family the
patient has a long history of chronic pain from her diabetes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.  Echo in [**2191-5-27**] showed EF
of 65% with evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, right
atrial enlargement, mild ASA, pulmonary artery pressure of 77
mm of mercury.  She has a MIBI in [**2191-5-27**] that showed
ejection fraction of 75% with a fixed lateral wall defect and
dilated RV with no reversibility.

2.  History of atrial fibrillation.

3.  Asthma.

4.  Hypertension.

5.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus consistent with
nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy.

6.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis for four years.

7.  Hepatitis C.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Nifedipine SR 60 mg p.o. q day.
2.  Insulin
3.  Nephrocaps two caps p.o. q day.
4.  Percocet.
5.  Coumadin.
6.  Epogen.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2, pulse 83, blood
pressure 94/58.  Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygen sats 85% on
room air and 96% on six liters.  HENT:  Extraocular movements
intact.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Anicteric
sclera. Neck supple.  Increased jugular venous distention to
30 degrees, no carotid bruits bilaterally.  Cardiovascular is
regular rate with a crescendo decrescendo mid to late peaking
systolic ejection murmur at the right sided systolic murmur
that increased with inspiration and a right sided S3.  The
patient also had a large right sided heave that is sustained.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally except some crackles
at the basis.  Abdomen soft, distended, positive bowel sounds
and enlarged liver to 8 cm below the ribcage.  No spleen is
palpable.  Extremities:  Exquisite tenderness bilaterally
with palpation palpable worse on the right.  Guaiac negative
stool.

Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema with cephalization.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats per
minute with an axis of 80 with normal intervals and no ST-T
changes when compared to prior electrocardiogram.  White
blood count 9.7, hematocrit 37.5, platelets 212, coags, PTT
58.1, INR 3.6, sodium 129, potassium 5.1, chloride 91,
bicarbonate 23, BUN 74, creatinine 7.5, glucose 166.  Calcium
8.1, magnesium 2.4.  CK 157.  Troponin pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's hypotension was attributed to
excessive loss of fluid during dialysis at outside hospital.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed
pulmonary hypertension, moderate MR with a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 50%  Coronary arteries showed left
anterior descending 80% mid-segmental focal stenosis at
bifurcation of D2 and proximal portion of the left anterior
descending was stented.

CT angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism, large heart with
subcutaneous pleural effusion right greater than left, no
calcification of the parenchymals.  A Swann-Ganz catheter was
placed to assess pulmonary capillary wedge pressure which was
initially elevated to 55.  It was felt that the degree of
pulmonary hypertension was still out of proportion to the
degree of left ventricular failure as well as mitral regurg.
She was diuresed with Lasix and given her increased wedge
pressure however, it was thought that the pulmonary
hypertension workup needs to be pursued once she is
adequately diuresed.  However, on [**10-4**] the patient
developed right arm weakness, Stat head CT showed
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Neurosurgery was consulted.  Her
Heparin was turned off.  She was administered Protamine.  She
was given several units of FFP to bring her INR down.
Aspirin and Plavix were stopped.  Despite over 20 units of
FFP her INR could not be lowered below 1.4 secondary to her
liver disease from Hepatitis C and right heart failure.

Over the course of the day the patient's neurological status
deteriorated.  A follow-up CT showed markedly enlarged
plaque.  Neurosurgery suggested conservative therapy since
surgically there was no indication for evacuation of
hemorrhage because of the location of the hemorrhage.  The
patient's bleeding was probably worsened by underlying
platelet dysfunction secondary to uremia.

Gastroenterology was consulted and they felt an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy is emergent however, given the
patient's "Do Not Resuscitate" status she could not be
scoped.  Given the patient's poor prognosis and worsening
bleeding status as per the patient's family the patient was
made CMO and started on Morphine drip on [**2191-10-6**].

The patient expired on [**2191-10-6**] at 2:51 AM.
