History of Present Illness:
83 yo female with h/o a fib on coumadin, HTN, and
hypercholesterolemia who presents now with lower abdominal sharp
cramps x 1 day and INR 7 at outside facility. She also has been
having loose stools since her discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]. Her lower
cramps this morning woke her up and are continuous and
nonradiating. Unclear if worse with food because she did not eat

general since her discharge. She complains of tenesmus. Denies
fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomitting, black or bloody
stools. She's taken coumadin for 20 years and never had a
problem but has also never been hospitalized and she also has
had a new diet of markedly less leafy green vegetables since
being at rehab. She had a recent hospitalization for mechanical
fall, mild acute heart failure, and cardiac enzyme elevation
thought to be demand ischemia. Of note, a CBC drawn at her
outside facility showed WBC 25.4, HCT 28.6, PLT 320. INR was
checked serially until [**2179-6-12**] with last INR of 2.9 and had been
rising. INR checked again at outside facility on [**2179-6-18**] was
7.3. She was given vitamin K 2.5mg PO ONCE at 1:45pm on [**2179-6-18**]
and referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.9 P 83 BP 130/50 R 16 O2 sat
99. Tmax in the ED was 100.0. Patient was given flagyl, cipro,

[**6-18**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis
INDICATION: Elevated white blood cell count and crampy abdominal
pain.

COMPARISON: None available.

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images were acquired through the abdomen and
pelvis
following the administration of 130 cc of intravenous Optiray
contrast.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also reviewed.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Imaged portions of the lung bases
notable for
dependent subsegmental atelectasis bilaterally. Visualized
portion of the
heart is enlarged. The stomach, duodenum, splenule, spleen,
gallbladder are unremarkable. Note is made of some thickening of
the adrenal glands
bilaterally, slightly larger on the left than right. The kidneys
enhance and excrete contrast in a symmetric fashion. A left
interpolar hypodensity is too small to characterize, likely a
cyst. The liver is unremarkable, though there is slight
prominence of the main, left and right hepatic biliary ducts.
The pancreas is notable for unchanged pancreatic duct dilatation
within the distal body and tail measuring up to 10 mm, with
surrounding parenchymal atrophy. The duct dilatation abruptly
terminates in the mid pancreatic body and no distinct mass is
noted on this exam in this region. There is also a 2.6 x 1.4 cm
lobulated cystic lesion in the uncinate process. Regional
vascular structures are notable for atherosclerotic
calcification of the aorta, without aneurysmal
dilation. There is no free gas or free fluid in the abdomen.
There is no
retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters,
uterus are
unremarkable. Note is made of a moderate length segment of
sigmoid colon,
which is notable for mural thickening as well as adjacent fat
stranding.
There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. There is no
free gas.
There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic
osseous lesion.  Note is made of extensive degenerative change,
which is present throughout the spine. Notably, there is a grade
1 anterolisthesis of L4 over L5 as well as a grade 1
retroli
