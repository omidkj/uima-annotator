ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Non Q wave MI.
2.  Pneumonia.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   The patient was an 81-year-old woman
admitted to the CCU service with a chief complaint of
ischemia, transient left bundle branch block, status post
cardiac catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old woman
with a past medical history significant for dementia,
depression, coronary artery disease of three vessels, status
post non Q wave MI in [**2110**].  The patient refused further
work-up at that time.  The patient was transferred from
[**Hospital3 2558**] the morning of admission for the evaluation of
respiratory distress.  On [**3-1**] at 10 p.m. the patient started
to complain of chest pain.  At that time she had vital signs
done which were significant for temperature of 100.4, heart
rate 88, respiratory rate 28 and blood pressure 160/80, no
oxygen saturation was recorded.  She received Nitroglycerin
.4 mg sublingual, Ativan 0.5 mg and Lasix 40 mg po.  She was
started on oxygen at that time. She felt better after these
interventions.  At 3:30 a.m. the day of admission she again
experienced chest pain and was given Nitroglycerin sublingual
times two.  At 7:30 a.m. she was noted to be hypoxic with an
oxygen saturation of 70% on three liters and she complained
of chest pain again.  Initially she refused to go to the
hospital and then she acquiesced and she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further care.  On
her way, the paramedics gave her Lasix 80 mg IV times one and
three Nitroglycerin sublingual.  In the Emergency Room she
had a systolic blood pressure in the 100's, she was
tachycardic to 110 and tachypneic to respiratory rate of 34.
She had an EKG that showed a heart rate of 120 with a new
left bundle branch block, increased left axis deviation and
ST depression in V4 through V6 on the initial EKG.
Subsequent EKGs showed progressive diffuse ST depression and
3-4 mm depressions in V3 through V6, 2-3 mm in V2, V3 and AVF
and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in 1, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in AVL.
Oxygen saturation was in the 60's in the Emergency Room.  She
was intubated nasally for hypoxia.  Her O2 sat increased to
80% and the ABG following intubation was 7.32, PCO2 50, PO2
74.  Following intubation and sedation, she dropped her blood
pressure to 50/30 and was started on Dopamine drip or
hypertension.  The patient then progressed to emergent
cardiac catheterization with a new left bundle branch block
and these ischemic changes with the presumption of
cardiogenic shock.  When she arrived in the cath lab, she had
a borderline systolic blood pressure in the low 100's on 20
mcg per minute of Dopamine and she had an intra-aortic
balloon pump placed.  She was started on Heparin and
Integrilin.  The RCA was noted to be diffusely diseased as
was the LAD and the circumflex.  The OM1 had a lesion that
looked acutely ruptured and occluding.  It was a small
vessel, it was intervened on by PTCA but it was not stented.
During the cath, they noted her filling pressures to be quite
low.  She was given bolus of normal saline and the cath lab
team was able to wean off the Dopamine and the balloon pump
was also removed post catheterization as her pressure came up
with aggressive fluid resuscitation.  She was then
transferred to the CCU for further care.  Upon arrival in the
CCU the Heparin and Integrilin had also been discontinued.
Prior to transfer to the CCU, a transthoracic echocardiogram
was done to evaluate for wide open mitral regurgitation.  It
showed ejection fraction 35-40% on the intra-aortic balloon
pump, 2+ TR, moderate regional LV dysfunction and hypokinesis
of the anterior septal and apical wall, 1+ MR and mild
pulmonary artery hypertension.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Dementia, Alzheimer's vs multi
infarct dementia and head CT has shown periventricular small
vessel ischemic changes.  2) Failure to thrive at home with
placement in a nursing home in the past year.  3) Depression.
4) Anxiety disorder presenting as stridor.  5) Hypertension.
6) Hypercholesterolemia.  7) History of CAD, status post non
Q wave MI in [**2110-2-24**].  She refused further work-up and
left AMA.  8) Hypothyroidism.  9) Peptic ulcer disease.  10)
Degenerative joint disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 2558**] with a
baseline dementia.  She does not use tobacco or alcohol.  Her
son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100610**] is the next of [**Doctor First Name **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival in the CCU, physical exam
revealed the patient was awake, she opened her eyes to voice,
she was nasotracheally intubated.  Temperature was 99.8.
Heart rate 88, blood pressure 111/43, respiratory rate 24.
Oxygen saturation 100%.  Ventilation settings were IMV 500
total volume, respiratory rate set at 10, PEEP 5, pressure
support of 5, FIO2 70%.  This was changed to C-Pap pressure
support 10 and 5 with FIO2 of 50%.  ABG was 7.38, 45, 95.
HEENT:  She was nasotracheally intubated through the right
nare.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Neck exam, patient had no JVD.  Chest,
bilateral rhonchi.  Heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, S1
and S2 were normal, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdominal
exam was soft, nontender, non distended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were cool with palpable pulses in all
four extremities.  Neuro, she moved all four extremities
spontaneously.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 13.9, hemoglobin 13.8,
hematocrit 39.2, platelet count 231,000.  Differential on the
white count, 83 neutrophils, 3 bands, 10 lymphs, 4 monos.  PT
12.7, PTT 36.0, INR 1.1.  SMA 7 was 142, 4.1, 99, 29, 22, 1.0
and glucose 151.  CK #1 in the Emergency Room was 129 with MB
of 3, CK #2 drawn on arrival at the CCU was 285, MB 32, MB
index 11.2.  Troponin 1.4.  Chest x-ray showed slightly
hyperinflated lungs with pulmonary infiltrates consistent
with pulmonary edema, right greater than left without any
obvious infiltrates.  EKG #1 done in the Emergency Room as
above, normal sinus rhythm at 120, left bundle branch block,
left axis deviation, ST depression 3-4 mm in V4 through V6,
ST depression 1 mm in 2.  Compared with prior EKG from [**2112-5-24**], left bundle branch block is new.  EKG #2, normal sinus
rhythm at 100, 3-[**Street Address(2) 5366**] depressions in V3 through V6, 2-[**Street Address(2) 11741**] depressions in 2, 3, and F.

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 81-year-old woman with past medical
history of coronary artery disease of three vessels, status
post non Q MI in [**2110**], hypothyroidism, depression, dementia,
admitted following an episode of acute pulmonary edema but
still unclear [**Name2 (NI) 100611**] etiology.  Several scenarios are
still possible at the time of admission including: 1)
Respiratory distress from some other etiology, possibly
pneumonia leading to overdiuresis and ischemia.  2) Diastolic
dysfunction, it is unknown why the patient would have become
ischemic but is it possible she became ischemic which then
led to pulmonary edema.  The patient also seems to be ruling
in for non Q wave MI.  This certainly could be the primary
lesion.  Patient became ischemic and went into pulmonary
edema.

PLAN:
1.  Cardiac:  CKs will be cycled until trending down.  EKGs
will be checked.  The patient will be placed on Aspirin,
Lipitor and a beta blocker as the blood pressure tolerates.
The patient will also be started on an ACE inhibitor as the
blood pressure tolerates.  She will be given IV fluids and
Lasix as needed to balance her volume status
