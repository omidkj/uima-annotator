History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 46772**] is a 77M with DM, CAD s/p MI, and CHF EF40% who is
admitted for elective cardiac catheterization. He was seen for
follow up in cardiology clinic on [**10-22**] at which time he reported
a two week history of progressive exertional dyspnea. The past
weekend he was admitted for these symptoms to [**Location (un) **] where he
was apparently diagnosed with a COPD exacerbation (with no known
history of COPD). On his follow up cardiology visit he admits
that has been using nitroglycerin tablets frequently at home, up
to 6 per day.
On presentation to the floor pt appears comfortable he denies
any current chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitation, or
nausea.  He admits to mild ankle edema and an occasional cough
which he attributes to his smoking history.

Final Report
CHEST AP SINGLE VIEW.

INDICATION: Line placement.

FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
sitting
semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a
preceding
similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same date.
The previously
identified left-sided permanent pacer with ICD device and right
atrial
electrode is in unchanged position. Previously present pulmonary
artery
catheter has been removed. The patient is extubated. It is
assumed that a
smaller caliber line advanced through the right internal jugular
vein approach
appears to be new and it is seen to terminate overlying the SVC
at the level
of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed and the pulmonary
vasculature
appears unchanged. No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen, and
only mild
blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses is identified on the
single view
portable chest examination.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax after line exchange.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Lipomatous hypertrophy
of the interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction. Severely
depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional left ventricular wall motion findings
as shown below; remaining LV segments contract normally.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Mildly dilated RV cavity.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed

regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect or PFO is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
