ERCP: Procedures: A plastic stent was removed from the major
papilla .
A 80mm by 8mm uncovered wallstent biliary stent was placed
successfully in the right main hepatic duct( REF [**Numeric Identifier 94394**] UPN
H965430300 LOT [**Numeric Identifier 105712**] ) .
A 60mm by 8mm uncovered wallstent biliary stent was placed
successfully in the left main hepatic duct ( REF [**Numeric Identifier 105713**] H
[**Numeric Identifier 105714**] LOT [**Numeric Identifier 105715**] )

Impression: Previous biliary sphincterotomy
2 pigtail plastic stents in the major papilla were removed with
the snare Bismuth type III stricture in the common hepatic duct
consistent with cholangiocarcinoma with dilated intrahepatic
ducts.
Metallic bilary wallstent placement into Left(8 mm by 60 mm )

.
EKG: NSR. No acute ST-T changes.
.
CXR: No acute process. Hyperinflation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10840**] is a 83 yo F w/PMHx sx for cholangiocarcinoma with
malignant stricture admitted after biliary stent exchange with
postoperative hypoxia.
.
She initially complained of severe chest pain. A chest x-ray was
performed and did not show evidence of infection or fluid
overload. She had a normal EKG. Three sets of cardiac enzymes
were checked and were normal. Initially she was placed on
telemetry, given aspirin 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg, and started
on metoprolol due to concern for an ischemic event in the
setting of ERCP. When her enzymes were negative, these were
discontinued.
.
Over the course of the next day, she was noted to have a
leukocytosis, and a fever, as well as hypoxia, concerning for an
aspiration event. She was started on levofloxacin and
metronidazole. Sputum and blood cultures were ordered. A speech
and swallow consult was placed and recommended thickened liquids
and ground solids, as well as 1:1 supervision with meals. Blood
cultures grew GPC in pairs and chains, and vancomycin was
started. Serial blood cultures were ordered and showed gram
negative rods.
.
She had chronic diastolic heart failure during her stay. She was
initially given a dose of 20 mg IV lasix for possible fluid
overload related to her ERCP, but was noted to be fairly
euvolumic with no evidnece of fluid overload on exam, and was
transitioned to lasix 40 mg twice daily per her home dose. She
had daily I/Os, daily weights. She was continued on aspirin, a
beta-blocker, and a statin, as well as lisinopril.
.
For her cholangiocarcinoma with malignant stricture, she is s/p
stent exchange. For her diabetes, her glipizide was held
inpatient, and she was continued on insulin sliding scale. She
was continued on her home medications for Parkinson's disease.

.
She was DNR/DNI during her stay, confirmed with her and her
husband.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] update:
In the morning of [**2168-9-20**] the hospitalist was called to assess
the patient for acute onset shortness of breath and hypoxia.
Per his note her SpO2 was initially 55% which improved to 75% on
a non-rebreather.  The patient was noted to be rigoring and
uncomfortable.  Of note the patient has parkinson's disease and
it was difficult to obtain an accurate finger oximetry. Her
blood pressure was measured at 230/60 and her respiratory rate
was 44. She received an albuterol nebulizer threatment and her
oxygen saturations improved to 98% on 4L NC but she remained
tachypneic in the 30s.  ABG performed during the trigger was
7.45/37/108.  Stat portable CXR was unchanged from priors.  She
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
On review of systems she notes feeling chilled and continues to
have shortness of breath.  She denies fevers, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain
or swelling.  She has not had a recurrence of the chest pain she
experienced on the night of admission.

Patient underwent CTA which showed no evidence of PE on CT scan,
no evidence of pna. Presumed shortness of breath was thought to
be secondary to bacteremia - grew out gram negative rods in
blood which grew while on levofloxacin with increasing WBC, most
likely biliary stent is the etiology. TTE without evidence of
vegetations, c. diff pending.

Medicine Floor Transfer)

Patient subsequently transferred from ICU to the medical floor.
Her [**9-16**] blood cx grew VRE while her [**9-20**] blood cx grew two
colonies of e.coli resistant to ampicillin, flouroquinolones and
bactrim.  The patient was discharged to complete a 14 day total
course of linezolid and ceftriaxone.  Of note, patient with
allergy of rash to PCN.  Would monitor for any evidence of
allergic reaction.
