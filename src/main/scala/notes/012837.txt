Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 62 yo F with emphysema and DMII who presents with fevers
and shortness of breath. Pt reports runny nose for the past
week, in addition to cough non-productive of sputum. Two days
before admission, she experienced chills and rigors. She also
report today a fever up to 105.1 at home, some muscle aches in
her arms. Denies CP but admits to some SOB and DOE. Took some
Tylenol efor the fever and took some vicodin for a headache on
Saturday (which is currently not present). Experienced some
nausea on the way to the ED. Denies neck stiffness or
photophobia. Her symptoms worsened to a point where her
daughters urged her to come for evaluation today. Reports some
'black' diarrhea in the ED, non-bloody. No recent antibiotic
use. She denies abdominal pain, new rashes, or dysuria.
.
In the emergency department, VS were: 100.1 119 74/27 16 94%. Pt
received Tylenol 1 gram PO x1, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and
Zofran. Labs significant for WBC of 21.2, Cre of 1.8 (baseline
of 1.0), lactate of 3.2->2.9 with 4 L IVFs. R IJ was placed in
the ED. VS on transfer wre 96/52 14 and 96% on 4 L NC. On the
floor, patient had a 10 beat run x2 of polymorphic VT versus
torsades. She remained hemodynamically stable. STAT repeat labs
showed a Mg of 1.0 which was replated with 4 grams of magnesium
sulfate IV x1. 1 L NS bolus was given with increase of MAP to
60. Given MVO2 was 68%, elevated lactate to 3.2 despite 5 L NS
resuscitation, and Cre of 2.1, levophed gtt was initiated.

CXR- [**2169-1-28**]
Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There

is moderate right middle lobe consolidation, worrisome for
pneumonia. The left lung is clear. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
There is calcification at the aortic knob. The mediastinum is
not widened.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderate right base consolidation, most likely in
the right middle lobe, worrisome for pneumonia.
.
IMAGING:
CXR- [**2169-1-31**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
change. Large right middle and lower lung pneumonia. No newly
appeared parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax, no reactive
pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. Unchanged size of the
cardiac silhouette. Unchanged right internal jugular vein
catheter.

Brief Hospital Course:
Community acquired pneumonia complicated by septic shock:
Presented with shortness of breath, fever, and leukocytosis as
well as fevers to 105.1 Farenheit at home.  Presented with
evidence of endo-organ ischemia with lactate of 3.2 and
creatinine of 2.1.  CXR showed probable right middle/lower lobe
PNA.  Empirically started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.  Had
hypotension to the 70's systolic prompting transfer to the ICU.
ICU course complicated by brief episode of polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia at which time patient found to have Mg
of 1.0.  Treated with magnesium which resolved episode.  Bolused
several liters of fluid but remained hypotensive, prompting
brief use of levophed drip.  Antibiotic coverage broadedned to
include aztreonam.  Sputum cultures positive for gram positive
cocci in pairs as well as gram negative diplococci.  Antibiotics
changed to ceftraixone, levofloxacin, and vancomycin.  Continued
to improve with oxygen requirements titrated down to room air.
Transferred to the general medical floors, where her antibiotic
regimen was narrowed to ceftraixone and levofloxacin.  She
continued to improve on this course.  Given her ICU admission
for community acquired pneumonia, she was continued on
cefpodoxime and levofloxacin for a total of a seven day course.
Should have follow up chest xray in six to eight weeks to assess
for resolution of pulmonary disease.

Acute renal failure: Likely pre-renal in the setting of
hypotension from sepsis. Creatinine intiially 2.1, but was down
to baseline of 1.0 by the morning of [**1-30**]. [**Last Name (un) **] and HCTZ held in
the setting of acute renal failure.  Restarted [**Last Name (un) **] and HCTZ by
time of discahrge.

Pancytopenia: Thought to be dilutional in the setting of
aggressive IVFs. Hct baseline 33-35, platelets 150s. Continued
to have pancytoopenia on the general medical floors.  By time of
discharge, WBC 4.4, HCT 25.7, PLT 137.  Should follow up CBC to
check for resolution of pancytopenia.  If continues, should
assess for drug induced cytopenia, or primary bone marrow
disorder with peripheral smear and potential heme/onc follow up.

COPD/Asthma:  Continued with albuterol/ipratropium,
fluticasone/salmeterol, inhalers as well as montelukast.
Continued to have wheezes and cough while in house.

Diabetes Mellitus II: oral hypoglycemics held, pt started on ISS
while in hospital.  Restarted on oral hypoglycemics at time of
discharge.  Normal glycemic during hosptial stay.

Hypertension: anti-hypertensives (metoprolol, losartan, HCTZ)
held in setting of sepsis.  Restarted prior to discharge.

Hyperlipidemia: continued statin.

Gout: held allopurinol in setting of renal failure.  Restarted
by time of discharge.

Tobacco abuse: nicotine patch.  Counseled o
