Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment.

Neuro: The patient was started on a trial of Sinemet for his
previously diagnosed Parkinson's Disease. He was also placed on
EEG monitoring, which revealed no seizures.

CV: Initially, the patient required a phenylephrine drip
secondary to hypotension. However, the patient was fluid
resuscitated, and was able to wean off phenylephrine
successfully. Similarly, as he was being intravascularly
repleted, his tachycardia resolved. He remained stable from a
cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet and chest physical therapy were encouraged throughout
hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Patient was
started on peptamen tube feeds, which were slowly increased a
goal rate of 55cc/hr. The patient tolerated this well.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection.  On presentation, he was
empirically started on vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro secondary to
concern for infection. Urine analysis and culture were negative.
Infectious disease consult recommended discontinuing
antibiotics, as there was no proven source of infection.

Endocrine: no issues

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; he was transfused with one unit of PRBC secondary to
downtrending Hct to 22.7. Patient Hct appropriately responded to
the transfusion, with a post-transfusion Hct of 29.6.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
