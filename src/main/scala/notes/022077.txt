Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Subdural Hematoma s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right sided frontal parietal temporal craniotomy
for decompression, evacuation of hematoma and duraplasty.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74 year-old female who was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 69**] Emergency room from an
outside hospital. By
report, she had fallen this morning. She had been well after her
fall and rather delayed interval was found unresponsive.  She
was brought to an outside hospital. A CAT scan was performed,
revealing a large acute subdural hematoma with midline shift.
The patient was transferred from the outside hospital to the
[**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival, the patient was in stable clinical
condition with a GSC of 3, secondary to medications. The patient
was rescanned while we set up and she was emergently taken to
the operating room for decompression.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 7111**] was brought to the OR on [**6-9**] and undewent a right
frontal parietal craniectomy for decompression of a subdural
hematoma.  Post operatively for the first 3 days she would
follow commands on right side, post op CT showed good evacuation
on blood products the first two post operative days there was
interval increase in subdural fluids but remained stable after
post operative day two.  Ms [**Known lastname 7111**] began having fevers on [**6-10**]
and was found to have a pneumonia and started on Levaquin. She
was started on an insulin drip for persistant high blood sugars.


Her mental status declined slowly on [**6-13**] and [**6-14**] where she was
no longer following commands an MRI showed:
 A small high signal focus on diffusion imaging within the right
medial posterior frontal lobe corresponds to an area of high
signal on T2 and FLAIR imaging, sequela of subacute infarction.
Smaller high signal focus within the left anterior corpus
callosum represents another area of subacute infarction. These
all correspond to hypodensities identified on CT. The small
hyperdense focus on T2 imaging within the right cerebellum also
represents a small infarction, though is not identified on
diffusion imaging secondary to artifact. A few very small
diffusion signal hyperintense foci are locted in the right
insula cortex and the subinsular white matter. The age of these
likely infarctions is uncertain.

A neurology consult was obtained to work up source of infarcts a
MRA failed to show vertebral dissection, carotid stenosis was
40% bilaterally and echo was negative for embolic source.

An MRI of her neck showed no ligamentous injury and her collar
was cleared post flexion extension films.

Her exam on [**6-20**] opened her eyes towards examiner and localized
in RUE extremity.  Her pneumonia appeared to be improving, an
EEG showed IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow and
disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing as
well as focal delta slowing in the right fronto-temporal region.
The last two abnormalities signify a widespread encephalopathy
affecting both cortical and subcortical
structures. Medications and many other causes are possible. The
right
fronto-temporal slowing indicates an area of subcortical
dysfunction on
the right side. This could be structural although that cannot be

determined by the recording. There were no clear epileptiform
features.

On  [**2182-6-21**] an extensive meeting was held with the family who
wished to extubated the patient as soon as possibly safe and not
to reintubate if needed she was already made DNR earlier in her
hospital stay. A repeat head CT showed relatively stable with
chronic right subdural and bilateral hygromas.   On [**6-22**] a
meeting was held with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and social work family was
determined to extubate to honor the patients wishes based on
living will.  The patient was extubated and started on a
morphine drip.

She passed away with her daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3748**] by her side at
0230 [**2182-6-24**].
