Dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
History obtained from family, patient, and chart.
64 yo female with h/o ESRD on HD, DM and CHF who presented to
the ED on [**2173-4-26**] with one day history of SOB.  The patient
states that she began feeling ill two days prior to admission.
She began to develop a non-productive cough.  She was staying
with her daughter and had soup (broth-like) for dinner on
Saturday.  Her daughter reports that she woke up at 2 AM on
Sunday morning c/o of being hot, but did not take her
temperature.  She woke up again at 4 AM c/o of being hot, and
was confused and had difficulty finding her way to the bathroom.
 When she woke up on Sunday morning (day PTA), she continued to
cough and was having "trouble breathing."  Her daughter reports
that she had DOE on ADLs.  She also states that the patient
looked puffy and had lower extremity edema.  She awoke on Monday
morning at approximately 1 AM with increased dyspnea and was
brought to the hospital by EMS.  On arrival in the ED she was
somnolent, but arousable and able to follow commands.  She was
hypertensive to 204/92 with a heart rate of 54.  She was
afebrile at that time and had a cough productive of yellow
sputum.  Her exam in the ED showed JVD, bibasilar crackles, but
no lower extremity edema.  She was given nitroglycerin in the ED
along with 60 mg IV lasix and was placed on CPAP. She was
eventually transitioned to 100% NRB.  She was also started on
Levaquin (750 mg IV). She was admitted to the MICU for dyspnea.

IMAGING:
[**2173-4-26**] CXR:
1. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which was not
identified on previous study from [**2173-4-6**]. This may
represent effusion, atelectasis or infiltrative process.
2. Cephalization and prominence of the pulmonary arterial
vasculature consistent with pulmonary edema.
.
[**2173-4-27**] CXR: There is a marked thoracic scoliosis convex to the
right. There is cardiomegaly but no evidence for CHF. The
ill-defined opacities present in the left mid and lower zones
and at the right base on the previous film of [**2173-4-26**], have
resolved suggesting that they represented atelectasis. No new
lung lesions. No pneumothorax. The relative lucency of the left
lung compared to the right is likely related to technical
reasons (rotated chest).


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12067**] is a 64 yo female with ESRD s/p cadaveric transplant
with return to HD, CHF, CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and DM who
presented to the ED with increasing SOB and evidence of CHF
exacerbation on CXR and physical exam.
.
1). CV:
# CAD: Patient denied any chest pain, but cardiac enzymes were
checked to evaluate for ischemic cause of her CHF. Her enzymes
were cycled in the MICU and her troponin was elevated, it was
felt that her elevated troponin was likely [**12-25**] to troponin leak
from HTN and that it did not clear due to her renal
insufficiency.  She was maintained on aspirin, atorvastatin. ECG
was unchanged from priors.
.
# Pump: CHF likely [**12-25**] to diastolic dysfunction and fluid
overload associated with ESRD and increased salt intake.  SOB
resolved throughout admission with hemodialysis. Patient
continued to cough with production of white frothy sputum,
likely [**12-25**] CHF. She was maintained on lisinopril. She was kept
on a low salt diet and a nutrition consult was placed for
patient education regarding a low salt diet.
.
# Rhythm: Sinus rhythm throughout admission. Continued on home
meds (metoprolol).
.
# HTN: The patient arrived in hypertensive urgency with BP to
204/92. She was originally on a nitroglycerin gtt and received
60 IV lasix in the ED. She did not respond well to the lasix, so
the nitroglycerin gtt was initially continued in the MICU. Once
her BP stabilized, the nitroglycerin gtt was discontinued and
she was taken for hemodialysis on the day of admission. 3.2L of
ultrafiltrate were removed. Her BP remained stable and was well
controlled during the remainder of her MICU stay and on the
floor. She was continued on her home meds (lisinopril and
metoprolol).
.
2). Pulm: Her SOB improved with volume management which was
mostly achieved through hemodialysis. She had required CPAP for
a short period in the ER, but prior to transfer to the MICU, she
was able to titrate down to 4L O2 by nc. Her initial CXR showed
a question of a LLL opacity obscuring the hemidiaphragam and
evidence for pulmonary edema. She was started on levaquin in the
ER, but this was not continued given that she was afebrile and
did not have a leukocytosis. Repeat CXR on [**4-27**] showed
improvement in the LLL opacity, suggesting that it was secondary
to atelectasis or pulmonary edema.  She had no oxygen
requirement on the floor. Sputum culture was sent but only grew
oropharyngeal flora. PT was consulted for help with
deconditioning and preparing the patient for discharge.
Initially, there was discussion of aspiration or OSA
contributing to her symptoms but the patient improved quickly
and the decision was made to defer any further workup to her
PCP.
.
3). Renal: Ms. [**Known lastname 12067**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] hemodialysis on [**4-26**] and [**4-28**].
She had 3.2L of UF removed on [**4-2
