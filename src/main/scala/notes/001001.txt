History of Present Illness:
81yo man with h/o CLL c/b malignant pleural effusion, primary
resected melanoma, type II diabetes mellitus, and Gout presented
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after mechanical fall and found to have subdural
hematoma.
.
The patient reports he tripped and fell on his oxygen cord at
home.  He was started on supplemental oxygen after his last d/c
from NEBH on [**2137-11-22**]. On initial presentation to ED T 98.8 HR
96 BP 99/43 RR 19  92% 2.5L.  He was admitted to the MICU for
further evaluation and treatment, and neurosurgery was
consulted.  Head CT showed multiple high density nodules
concerning for metastatic disease.  He was loaded with dilantin
and monitored overnight without any detioration in neurologic
status.  Repeat head CT showed stable appearance of the SDH.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted.  He was transfused 6units
platelets in the ED, and underwent leukopheresis in the MICU.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 25864**]/05 on
Oncology service for leukopheresis and chemo for his CLL after
presenting with dyspnea and WBC 678K.

pain in his right shoulder.  He denies headache, dizziness,
confusion, vision changes, nausea.  On ROS he denies fever,
chills, sweats, palpitations, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, bloody stools,
dysuria, hematuria.  He notes some skin changes in his arms c/w
small bruises.

Pertinent Results:
[**11-24**] Head CT:
1.  High density nodules and multiple ill-defined hypodensities
scattered
throughout the brain, suggestive of a metastatic process.
2.  Very small (approximately 1 mm) right extra-axial fluid
collection, with associated mild edema of the right hemisphere,
but without midline shift.
An MRI of the brain is recommended for further evaluation of
these findings.
.
[**11-24**] CXR:
New moderate-sized right pleural effusion, with underlying
collapse and/or consolidation.  Atelectasis at left base.
Prominent right
hium --
.
[**11-25**] Head CT:
No interval change in the appearance of the brain.  Stable tiny
right subdural hemorrhage.  Unchanged appearance of multiple
high attenuation lesions scattered within the brain concerning
for metastasis.
.
[**12-1**] CXR: There is a right-sided IJ central venous catheter, with
the distal tip in the SVC, unchanged. There is again seen a
large right-sided pleural effusion likely layering and a
left-sided pleural effusion which is moderated sized. These are
unchanged from previous. There is no evidence for overt
pulmonary edema. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. This
finding is unchanged. Underlying pneumonia would be difficult to
exclude given the retrocardiac opacity and the large pleural
effusions.
.
ECHO: [**12-6**]:
Conclusions:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size  and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is  normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal.  Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
CT Head [**2137-12-5**]:
FINDINGS: There is a new moderate sized mixed density subdural
fluid collection on the right. The lateral ventricle is
completely compressed indicating mass effect from the subdural
fluid collection as well as a 3 mm shift of the normally midline
structures. The mixed intensity of the collection likely
consists of blood and other fluid given the mixed densities. The
previously identified high-density lesions are subsiding
indicating that these were most likely hemorrhages rather than
amyloid angiopathy.
.
CT Head [**2137-12-6**]:
There is no change in the size or configuration of the
right-sided subdural hemorrhage. Denser blood products are
layering posteriorly. The hematoma extends under the right
temporal lobe, which is slightly elevated and medially
displaced. However, the basal cisternal spaces retain their
normal configuration. There is mild shift of midline structures
to the left, unchanged since the previous day's examination.
Brain parenchymal attenuation is also stable.
.
CT Head [**2137-12-9**]:
IMPRESSION: Stable right subdural hematoma with slight
progression of mass effect and shift of midline structures.
.
CT Head: [**2137-12-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Slightly improved right subdural hematoma and
associated mass effect, with lessened contralateral shift of
normally midline structures.

Brief Hospital Course:
81yo man with h/o CLL c/b malignant pleural effusion, primary
resected melanoma, type II diabetes mellitus, and gout presented
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after mechanical fall and found to have subdural
hematoma.  During his hospitalization the following issues were
addressed:
.
#.  Subdural hematoma:  Hemorrhage occurred in the setting of
mechanical fall.  He was seen by neurosurgery who recommended
keeping SBP <140 and loading with Dilantin.  He was admitted to
the MICU for frequent neuro checks, and remained there for one
day.  On day two, his Dilantin level was subtherapeutic, and he
was reloaded.  On day three he developed neurologic changes of
increased lethargy and dysarthria.  Findings were consistent
with Dilantin toxicity.  His AM dose was held on day four, and
symptoms resolved. He was continued on Dilantin 100mg po TID.
His head CT showed multi
