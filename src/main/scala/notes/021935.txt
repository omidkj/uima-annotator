Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2153-6-20**], she underwent living non-related renal transplant
from husband. A 6-[**Name2 (NI) 18252**] double J stent was inserted into the
renal pelvis. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to
operative note for details. Urine output was excellent. IV fluid
replacements were given. Induction immunosuppression was
administered (ATG, Solumedrol and Cellcept).

Creatinine decreased to 1.1 on postop day one. Urine output was
10 liters for the day. She experienced a lot of nausea. IV
Zofran was given with only minimal relief. IV Phenergan was
given. She received a 2nd dose of ATG (75mg). During this
infusion she became febrile to 101.7. Blood and urine cultures
were done. Temperature increased to 102.6. She was pan-cultured
again and a portable CXR was unremarkable. Urine output
decreased significantly. IV fluid boluses and albumin were
given. Renal duplex was done and showed patent vessels. A small
perinephric collection was noted.Foley was irrigated without
increase in urine output.

Given persistent decrease in urine output and development of
tachycardia with low blood pressure, she was transferred to the
SICU for management. Hct was stable.  TTE was done and was
normal. She continued to receive aggressive IV fluid replacement
with response of increased urine.  ATG (3rd dose)was held.
Lopressor was given for tachycardia.

On [**6-22**], repeat CXR demonstrated  bibasilar opacities compatible
with consolidation and/or atelectasis.  Slight increase in
pulmonary vascular congestion. Non-contrast abdominal CT was
done On [**6-23**] after blood cultures were noted to be positive.
Bilateral pneumonia, left worse than right, compatible with
aspiration
pneumonia, no collection or infectious process was noted within
the abdomen and pelvis, or evidence of bowel injury.

Once stable, she transferred out of the SICU. Urine output
greater than a liter per day. Blood cultures from [**6-22**] isolated
pseudomonas aeruginosa (pan-sensitive)on [**6-24**]. IV Vancomycin was
started on [**6-24**]. WBC was up to 17 on [**6-25**]. Vancomycin was
switched to Cefepime on [**6-25**] per ID. A 2 week course of Cefepime
was recommended. A left arm Midline was placed on [**6-26**] for IV
antibiotics.

She remained afebrile. BP was elevated. Lopressor was continued.
Weight was up to 74.7 kg from admission weight of 61 kg. Lasix
was given with excellent diuresis. Weight decreased to 70 kg.
Creatinine was done to 1.3. Urine output averaged 2700 with
Lasix.

Diet was advanced and tolerated. She passed stool. [**Last Name (un) **] was
involved and adjusted insulin for hyperglycemia. Abdominal
incision was intact with staples and no redness/drainage. She
was ambulating independently on postop day 6.

Immunosuppression consisted of CellCept which was well
tolerated, and Prograf which was adjusted to 2mg [**Hospital1 **] per trough
levels of 10.3. Steroid taper was complete. Of note, she was
never given 3rd dose of ATG.

She felt well enough to go home on [**6-26**] and was discharged on
Lasix 20mg daily as weight was still up 10kg from baseline.
Lopressor was switched to home dose of amlodipine. She will have
labs on [**6-28**].
