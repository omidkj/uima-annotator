History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] saw Ms. [**Known lastname 41033**] as a neurosurgical evaluation
follow-up
after her visit in the hospital and hospitalization.  She has a
large lytic lesion on the vertebral body of T7 and minimal on T8
on one side.  She was placed on TLSO brace while she was getting
radiation treatment in hopes of
improving her symptoms and not needing surgery.  However, she
still has significant back pain and point tenderness.

Her strength was full in both lower extremities.  No
hyperreflexia, no
myelopathy.  CT imaging showed a lytic lesion at T7 seems to
have increased in size and also there is anterior wedge collapse
of the T7 vertebral body.
Relatively stable T8 lesion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] recommended a thoracic fusion and she agreed
to proceed.

Pertinent Results:
[**2195-9-10**] MRI T-Spine: Soft tissue mass replacing the majority of
the T7 vertebral body with interval pathologic compression
fracture of the T7 vertebral body.  Soft tissue mass extends
into the T6 and T8 vertebral bodies as described above; findings
are again compatible with metastatic disease.

[**2195-9-12**] T-spine Xray AP and Lateral: T1-11 fusion, adequate
hardware placement and [**Last Name (un) 2043**] alignment

[**2195-9-14**] KUB:Diffuse mildly dilated loops of small and large
bowel are compatible with ileus.

[**9-16**] LENIs - No evidence of deep vein thrombosis either right or
left lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Neurologic Surgery Service for
management of a anterior kyphosis due to tumor T7 and T8.  The
patient was taken to the OR and underwent an uncomplicated T1-11
instrumented fusion.  The patient tolerated the procedure
without complications and was transferred to the PACU in stable
condition.  Please see operative report for details. Post
operatively pain was controlled with intravenous medication with
a transition to PO pain meds once tolerating POs.  The patient
tolerated diet advancement without difficulty and made steady
advancement with diet and ambulation. On the evening of POD 2
she developed worsening back pain and required an increase in IV
pain medication for breakthrough pain.

In the morning of POD3 however the patient developed an episode
of delerium that cleared over 20-30 minutes, likely related to
pain medication and muscle relaxants and exhaustion.  UA and
culture were sent.  Geriatrics team was consulted for
recommendations on pain medications to limit delerium.  She
developed abdomninal pain and distension and KUB demonstrated
Ileus.  Soap [**Last Name (un) **] enema was administered for presence of larege
amounts of stool on KUB. She was passing flatus and was somewhat
more confortable on [**9-15**]. She was mobilized with PT and OT. Her
Foley was discontinued. Per Geriatrics, trazodone replaced
benadryl for her sleep aide and tylenol was made ATC.

[**9-16**] patient was having some loose stools, but was having
difficulty urinating. She was straight cathed several times and
eventually the foley catheter was replaced. Lower extremity
Dopplers were performed for complaint of calf tenderness and
there was o DVT. Follow up KUB showed minimal improvment in
ileus and no SBO. She was OOB more on [**9-17**] and continued to have
significant flatus. she had less pain.

On [**9-18**], patient continued to have mild nausea.  As a result,
patient was started on reglan to increase gastric motility.  In
addition, her foley was d/c'd in routine fasion.

She continued to improve in terms of her constipation.  She
continued to pass [**Last Name (un) **].  Belly pain improved.  Now DOD, patient
is afebrile, VSS, and neurologically stable.  Patient's pain is
well-controlled and the patient is tolerating a good oral diet.
Pt's incision is clean, dry and intact without evidence of
infection.  Patient is ambulating without issues.  Patient's
brace was fitted and patient received instructions on care and
appropriate use. She is set for discharge home in stable
condition and will follow-up accordingly.
