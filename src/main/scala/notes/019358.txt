KUB [**2115-11-12**]
FINDINGS:  There are multiple dilated small bowel loops
overlying the mid
abdomen.  The proximal small bowel loops are not dilated.  There
may be
increased bowel wall of the dilated small bowel loops.  This may
represent a
focal ileus, and partial strangulation of small bowel cannot be
excluded.  The
soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2115-11-13**]
IMPRESSION:

1.  Large ventral hernia including large and small loops of
bowel as well as
the anastomotic site.  Dilated loops of contrast-filled small
bowel with no
evidence of transition site.  There is no evidence for acute
obstruction;
however, partial obstruction cannot be excluded and if there is
clinical
concern, re-scanning of the patient can be performed.

2.  Circumferentially thickened esophageal walls with
subcentimeter
periesophageal lymph nodes.  This is consistent with the
patients known
history of esophagitis. Neoplasm cannot be excluded based on
these imaging
findings. The previously visualized lower esophageal stent is
not seen on this
examination.

3.  Right kidney stone.

4.  The previously seen hypoattenuating contour deformity in the
left kidney
on a non-contrast CT does not correlate with abnormalities in
this region on
the current exam.

5.  Small ill-defined pulmonary subcentimeter
consolidations/nodules to which
attention can be paid on any followup exams.

[**2115-11-7**] CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1.  Large ventral hernia including some colon and small bowel,
but without
evidence of any obstruction.
2.  Extensive calcification in the aorta down through the levels
of the iliac
arteries bilaterally.  Extensive calcification also involves the
SMA.  No
bowel wall edema is noted.
3.  Hypoattenuating contour deformity noted in the left kidney.
This study is
slightly limited as no IV contrast was used. Renal ultrasound
could be helpful
in further evaluating this area if clinically indicated.
4.  Esophageal stent seen in place.
5.  No evidence of any free air within the abdomen.

[**2115-11-7**] PA and lat
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Esophageal stent
in the mid- thoracic esophagus.




Brief Hospital Course:
A: 70 year old male with h/o HTN, CAD presents with
hypertension, AG acidosis, hyperglycemia, and leukocytosis
following esophageal stent placement
.
P:
1) Hyperglycemia/DKA: On the night of admission the initial
concern was hypertensive urgency following stent placement.
However, the pt's blood pressure was shortly brought under
control with IV lopressor. Per the pt's wife, he had similar
reactions in the past post-procedure, ie, he would become
hypertensive with quick resolution. On the night of admission
the pt had mild nausea, but this was suspected to be [**2-13**] to the
procedure as well and it was felt that the pt would be
discharged shortly after BP and nausea control on the floor.
However, blood sugars on the morning after admission were shown
to be elevated to the 400s-500s. The pt was also shown to have
an AG >20. Initially the pt's AG was suspected to be more likely
[**2-13**] to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12376**] perf or some other GI process as opposed to DKA
given his lack of DM hx. A chest PA and Lat at the time showed
no free air. A CT abd/pelvis also demonstrated no acute
abdominal process. A U/A, however, showed positive
glucose/ketones/and wbcs. The pt was thus felt to be in DKA,
though this was an unusual presentation for type II diabetes or
new onset type I diabetes, uncommon in this age group. Initially
the pt was managed on the floor with a humalog ISS and q 2hour
FS. However, the pt was initially transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where
his AG gap closed and his blood sugar was brought under control.
He was transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] back to the floor for further
management.
.
Later on further questioning, the pt's wife reported that his FS
was 400 ~ 4 months ago at his nephrologists office, although his
PCP told her that he did not have diabetes and did not recommend
treatment. The pt's Hb A1C on this admit was found to be 15.2.

The pt was discharged on glargine and an ISS protoccol as
attached in d/c planning, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].
.
2) abdominal pain--Initially the pt's abdominal pain was felt to
be [**2-13**] to nausea/vomiting related to DKA. Howeve
