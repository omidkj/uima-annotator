Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old male nursing home resident admitted for sepsis
secondary to pneumonia.
.
1. Sepsis: The likely source of his sepsis is pneumonia.  On
arrival to the ICU, he was hypotensive with a MAP betweem 55-60.
 He required 5 liters of normal saline to maintain his CVP >
[**9-4**] in the first 12 hours.  His cortisol stimulation test
showed adequate response.  His initial venous saturation were
slightly low, indication a cardiogenic component to his
hypotension.  He was started on an ionotrope because of the risk
of peripheral vasodilation.  His venous saturation improved to
greated than 70 within the first 6-8 hours of admission.  After
the first day of hospitalization, he did not require any fluid
boluses to maintain is blood pressure.  For his pneumonia, he
was initially started on empiric antibiotic coverage with
vancomycin, zosyn, and azithromycin.  Once sputum cultures were
negative for 48 hours and urinary legionella antigen was
negative, he was switched to a less broad regimen of ceftriaxone
and azithromycin to complete a 10 day course.  He initially
required non-rebreather to maintain his oxygenation but was
weaned as tolerated to 2 -3 L via NC.  He was transferred to the
floor, and there recieved chest physical therapy in addition to
the above until his d/c back to his nursing home on [**2165-9-3**].
.
2. Atrial fibrillation: He does not have history of atrial
fibrillation and it was probably induced by the acute infection.
 He returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm during the first
hospilization day.  He was not started on anticoagulation given
his fall risk.
.
3.  Elevated troponin: His troponin was likely elevated due to
demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension.  His CKs remained
flat.  He was maintain on aspirin.\
.
4. Dementia/Agitation: Initially, he was not repeatedly
following commands.  His mental status improved by hospital day
2 and he was appropriately answering questions and following
commands.  At night, he occasionally became agitated requiring
zyprexa.
.
5. FEN: He was initially NPO given his mental status.  Once his
mental status improved, he had a bedside speech and swallow and
was cleared for pureed solids and thin liquids with aspiration
precautions.  He was maintained on maintenence fluids while he
was NPO.  His magnesium, potassium, and calcium were repleted.
