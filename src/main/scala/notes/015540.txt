Blood culture [**2181-11-22**]: NGTD (pending final)

Labs upon discharge: *******************

CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2181-11-20**]: 1. Interval decrease in multiple
mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
2. MR of the L-spine is more sensitive for evaluation of the
central canal, however, no gross evidence of spine or central
canal involvement is noted.  Mild collapse of the L4 vertebral
body inferior endplate and L3 vertebral body superior endplate
is new since [**2179**] and may represent lymphomatous involvement.
Correlation with recent MR is recommended.
3. Diffuse ulcerated soft plaque throughout the aorta with an
unchanged
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 32 x 35 mm.

CT head [**2181-11-22**]:  No acute intracranial process including no
evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.

CXR [**2181-11-12**]: The heart size is enlarged, slightly more than on
the prior study, which might be attributed to the film
technique. The left Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of
cavoatrial junction. Mediastinal contours are unchanged
including mild prominence of the aortopulmonic window due to
known lymph nodes. Hilar prominence due to known lymph nodes on
the left is unchanged as well. There is no interval development
of focal abnormality, but diffuse prominence of the perihilar
interstitium and lower lungs might be consistent with interval
development of pulmonary edema versus infectious process such as
mycoplasma or viral infection. Close followup is suggested. No
appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
62F w/Hodgkin's lymphoma last treated on [**11-7**] w/liposomal
doxorubicin presenting w/worsening low back pain, imaging c/w
possible lymphomatous infiltrate with chief complaint of low
back pain, who was briefly admitted to the ICU for respiratory
monitoring in addition to hypoglycemia.
.
# Altered Mental Status: The Patient was sent to the MICU with
with altered mental status and hypercarbia.  CT head was
negative for acute intracranial processes.  Her AMS was likely
secondary to hypoventilation due to opiates as she became
lethargic and desaturated after administration of oxycodone,
prompting initiation of BiPAP.  Her opiates were held and she
was given naloxone, after which time she became more alert.  Her
long acting opiates were discontinued as noted below.  She was
kept on short acting opiates prior to discharge with follow up
in [**Hospital 3242**] clinic for management of her lower back pain.
.
# Respiratory Depression: She was sent to the ICU for
hypoventilation and hypercarbi
