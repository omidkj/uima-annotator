History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 40 year-old female with multiple cormobidities,
including CAD s/p NSTEMI s/p CABGx5 ([**6-/2200**]) with course
complicated by necrotizing tracheitis s/p tracheostomy who has
required multiple interventions including balloon dilation,
stoma
revision, and several attempts with CO2 laser excision, most
recently in 04/[**2200**]. She is closely followed by Pulmonology, ENT
and her cardiologist. She was most recently admitted to the
Medicine service on in [**3-/2201**] after another re-attempt at laser
excision of this area of tracheal stenosis, which on previous
imaging is approximately 4cm. Her hospital course was
complicated
by hypotension and somnolence likely secondary to excessive pain
medication requiring observation in the ICU with no additional
airway interventions. She was stabilized and transferred back to
the floor without sequelae. She was pre-operatively evaluated by
cardiology with recommendations to continue her current regimen
of metoprolol, aspirin, plavix and lipitor without the need for
additional testing. She was discharged home in good condition.

In the interim, she has followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
Pulmonology for anticipated surgery. She currently denied any
worsening shortness of breath or chest pain; she denied any
fevers or chills. She notes an intermittent cough with
secretions
through her tracheostomy which are easily suctioned. She also
notes dyspnea on walking, which is approximately her baseline
and
has not exacerbated in the past month.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent a cervical tracheal
resection, reconstruction with anterior cricoid split, flexible
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and suprahyoid
release.  She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the
SICU in stable condition.  She  remained intubated and
maintained stable hemodynamics.  Plans were for her to remain
intubated until some of her supraglottic edema decreased.

She returned to the Operating Room on [**2201-5-11**] for a bronchoscopy
with potential extubation but her edema persisted.  At that
point she began tube feedings to maintain her calorie
requirements and she continued to be vigorously diuresed.  On
[**2201-5-18**] she returned to the Operating Room for another
bronchoscopy  which showed decreased edema and a healthy
anastomosis.  The ENT service also did a direct laryngoscopy and
agreed the edema was much less.  Her cords could not be
evaluated as she was sedated.  She was then extubated
successfully.

As she continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint, she
underwent a bedside swallow to assess her swallowing capacity
but unfortunately she had overt symptoms of aspiration and
therefore remained NPO.  She refused placement of a feeding tube
which made it difficult boost her nutrition and maintain her pre
op medications.  She was re evaluated with a video swallow and
aspiration was confirmed.  Unfortunately some of her psych
medications had to be withheld for a period of time
and she developed what appeared to be delirium with impulsive
behavior, poor concentration and poor judgement.  The
Psychiatric service was consulted and made medication
adjustments and at the same time her swallowing was improving so
she was able to resume all of her prior medications.  After a
few days she was much more reasonable, engaged in conversation
and had better judgement.

The Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy service evaluated
her on multiple occasions and noted her daily  improvement in
balance and mobility.  The Speech and swallow therapist
recommended pureed solids and honey thick liquids after her
video swallow on [**2201-5-25**]. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was reluctant to always
adhere to this diet as she felt that her swallowing was normal.
I spoke with Dr.[**Name (NI) 90677**] assistant who will arrange for her
to have a speech and swallow evaluation in [**Location (un) **], NH, closer to
home, within the next week or two.

After a long hospital stay, she was discharged to home on
[**2201-5-28**] and will follow up in the Thoracic Clinic in 3 weeks as
well as with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65534**], next week.
