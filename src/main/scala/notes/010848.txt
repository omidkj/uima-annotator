Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 49-year-old with
past medical history significant for congenital bicuspid
valve repaired with an organ donor [**2186**] who presented to the
Emergency Department on [**11-26**] with a complaint of
fevers of 103.0 F for one day, lower back pain of one month
duration.  The patient reports he had an annual physical with
echo which was within normal limits and a flu shot late
[**Month (only) **].  Patient reports that he felt particularly "run"
down status post shot with continued mild fatigue.  The
patient also had gums cleaned around that time with positive
mild bleeding.

The second week in [**Month (only) 359**], the patient developed dry cough.
The patient was put on prophylaxis with Erythromycin during
the dental cleaning.  Treated with Azithromycin in [**Month (only) 359**]
for his cough without improvement.  He was placed on a one
week course of Erythromycin.  Bronchitis / cough resolved,
but patient developed acute back pain between the shoulders.
Patient described it as stabbing.  The patient felt tired and
weak increasingly which was attributed to excruciating back
pain.

This past Wednesday, the patient was walking with his
daughter and knees buckled.  The pain suddenly migrated to
the lower back.  Thursday in the AM, the patient reports
fatigue and weakness.  He could not rise from bed.  He
subsequently went to the Emergency Department.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 100.4 F, 85, 102/46, 16 to
22, 99 to 100% on two liters nasal cannula.  Generally the
patient was diaphoretic in no acute respiratory distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normal.  Heart:
Pansystolic murmur at upper sternal border to carotids.  It
could be heard throughout the precordium.  Lungs:  Crackles
at bases bilaterally, slight expiratory wheeze.  Back:  No
vertebral tenderness.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  Neuro:  [**5-10**] upper and lower extremity strength, 2+
reflexes throughout.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  Hematocrit 35.9, creatinine of 0.7.
Urinalysis showed moderate protein.  CK and troponin I were
both normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service on [**2195-11-26**] at which time blood cultures times
three were sent and Vancomycin was started.  In addition
after Infectious Disease consult, Gentamycin was also
started.  Subsequent echocardiogram (TTE) showed moderate
dilation of the left atrium, slight decrease in left
ventricular function, severe aortic stenosis (question
vegetation), severe aortic insufficiency with two vegetations
on the mitral valve with moderate MR.  The patient was also
noted to have a hematocrit of 25.2 on his hospital day #3.
MRI of the lumbar vertebral discs shows herniation between L3
and L4 with no evidence of epidural abscess.

Blood cultures from [**11-26**] subsequently grew nutritionally
variant strep.  Intermittently the patient received packed
red blood cells for hematocrit and subsequently hematocrit
increased.  On [**12-3**], the patient was found to be
short of breath with tachypnea and having O2 requirement.
Then at approximately 7 PM, the patient had a respiratory
arrest and was intubated then admitted to the CCU. The
patient was subsequently started milrinone drip to decrease
afterload.  The patient's cardiac index was 4.6 at that time
with a wedge pressure of 18.2.

The patient was placed on assist-control ventilation and
sedated with Propofol.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was subsequently started
on Levofloxacin and Flagyl then continued on Vancomycin.  The
patient was believed to have ATN secondary to decreased urine
output and rising BUN and creatinine which was 23 and 1.3
respectively.  The patient subsequently resolved by
increasing his urine output to an adequate level.  Renal
insufficiency was thought to be secondary to hypoperfusion,
but resolved without permanent sequela.

In the CCU the patient spiked a temperature of 101.8 F and
patient was then subsequently pan cultured as above.
Antibiotics were continued which included Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Tube feeds were initiated in the
CCU and on [**2195-12-7**] the patient was brought to the
Operating Room for mitral valve repair and homograft roof
replacement.  The patient was on coronary bypass for 207
minutes and was cross clamped for 106 minutes.

Postoperatively, the patient was started on Nitroglycerin to
reduce preload and milrinone to help cardiac output and
decrease afterload and Propofol for sedation.
Postoperatively, the patient was placed on SIVM with tidal
volume of 600, respiratory rate of 14 on 60% oxygen.

Intraoperatively, the patient was transfused with two units
of packed red blood cells and two units of FFP and two chest
tubes were placed as well as two ventricular and two atrial
wires.  Postoperatively, he diuresed well on a Lasix drip and
continued to have ongoing ectopy.  On postoperative day #3,
he was extubated without incident, but unfortunately, his
creatinine and BUN were creeping up.

On postoperative day #5, the patient had an episode of
bradycardia to the 40s and Amiodarone was subsequently held.
The creatinine improved from 2 to 1.7 and he continued to
make good urine and respond well to Lasix challenges.  On
postoperative day #8, the patient was transferred to the
Surgical Floor in good condition.  He maintained his blood
pressure and heart rate in the 70s with normal sinus rhythm
without ectopy.  Aggressive pulmonary toilet was continued in
light of an aspiration pneumonia diagnosed during his
postoperative day for which he continued to be treated with
Levaquin.

The patient received a PICC line for an extended period of IV
antibiotics on postoperative day #10.  Unfortunately, it was
found that his white blood cell had increased from 14 the
previous day to 16 and blood cultures, urine culture and
chest x-ray were all done which did not show any changes and
were all essentially negative.

At that time, it was decided that the patient should also be
treated with Gentamycin on a low dose secondary to his
previous acute renal failure.  The Gentamycin was started on
a low dose and was titrated up to therapeutic levels to avoid
nephrotoxicity.  The patient was subsequently discharged in
good condition to rehab for short term physical therapy and
continued IV antibiotics.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post graft valve endocarditis.
2.  Status post mitral valve repair, homograft root
replacement complicated by respiratory failure, acute renal
failure and aspiration pneumonia.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) 996**]P:  Patient is to follow up with primary care
physician in one week and with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four weeks.
