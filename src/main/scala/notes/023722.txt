Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Mild dyspnea on exertion/Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2115-2-26**] Aortic valve replacement (21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] epic
bioprosthetic)
[**2115-2-25**] Cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with history of aortic stenosis which has
been followed with serial echocardiograms for the past several
years. She has been told she has a heart murmur for several
decades. This past [**Month (only) 205**] she developed congestive heart failure
requiring admission to the intensive care unit and diuresis. Her
most recent echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis with
increased gradients across her valve and a reduced ejection
fraction. She denies any symptoms however when pressed and with
the assistance of her family will admit to mild dyspnea on
exertion and fatigue. She is not very active though. Given the
severity of her disease, she was referred for surgical
management. She denies any changes in her health since last seen
in cardiac surgery clinic.

Carotid Bruit  Transmitted vs. bruit

Pertinent Results:
[**2115-2-25**] Cardiac cath: Right dominant,LMCA:  No
angiographically-apparent CAD. LAD:  Moderate calcification with
mild luminal irregularities. 2.0 mm diagonal has proximal 60%
stenosis. LCX:  No angiographically-apparent CAD. RCA:  Ostial
30% stenosis
.
[**2115-2-25**] Carotid U/S:  No evidence of significant carotid artery
stenosis bilaterally, unchanged from prior study from [**2110**].
.
[**2115-2-26**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: A bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position.
The valve is well-seated and the leaflets are normally mobile.
There are thin, filamentous echodense masses seen on the
prosthetic leaflets which do not affect valvular function or
hemodynamics. There are no paralvular leaks. There is no AI. The
peak gradient across the aortic valve is 23mmHg, the mean
gradient is 8mmHg with CO of 4.5L/min. The left ventricular
systolic function remains moderately depressed. Estimated
EF=35%. Right ventricular systolic function remains normal.
Other valvular function remain unchanged.
There is no evidence of dissection. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results at time of study

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 95666**] has known aortic stenosis and was admitted for
cardaic cath and found to have non-significant coronary disease
and was takentot he operating on [**2115-2-26**] for replacement of her
aortic valve (#21mm st. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 95667**]). See operative note for
details. Post-operatively she arrived to the CVICU from the
operating room intubated and sedated. She awoke neurologically
intact and was weaned and extubated. On POD#1 she was started on
betablockade, lasix and statin therapy. She was noted to be in a
junctional rhythm and her betablocker was stopped. She returned
to sinus rhythm within 24 hrs. She developed brief non-sustained
runs of afib and low dose betablockade was resumed and well
tolerated. At that point her temporary pacing wires were removed
as were her chest tubes. Lisinopril was resumed for chronic
systolic and diastolic heart failure. Throughout her hospital
stay she experienced urinary incontinence which had been a
problem pre-operatively as well. She was evaluated by physical
therapy for strength and conditioning and was cleared for
discharge to home. On POD#4 she was discharged to home to live
with her sons. [**Name (NI) **] appointments and instructions were advised.
