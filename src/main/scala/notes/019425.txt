History of Present Illness:
This is  a 78 yof pmh HTN, CABG x 1 vessel [**2148**], hyperlipidemia,
hypothyroidism, BRCA s/p lumpectomy/XRT [**2167**] and thyroid nodule

home. Unclear whether there was head trauma however pt was so
lethargic and bedridden that family decided to bring her into
[**Hospital1 18**].

Imaging:
[**1-5**] Left shoulder x-ray: Calcific tendinitis of the left
shoulder.

[**1-6**] CXR:  prominent pulmonary vasculature, consistent with an
element of fluid overload.  asymmetric perihilar haziness, and
faint opacity in the left lower lung zone.

[**1-6**] abd CT/pelvic CT: extensive retroperitoneal fluid and
stranding, which appears to center around the pancreas, with
extension along Gerota's fascia, and adjacent to the second and
third parts of the duodenum.  Additionally, there is marked
bowel wall edema of the entire duodenum, and to a lesser degree,
of the proximal jejunum.  There is secondary gallbladder wall
edema, and free intraperitoneal fluid.  The pancreatic contour,
however, does appear well circumscribed. These findings may
represent changes from pancreatitis, or alternatively, this may
represent a focal duodenitis, with secondary changes in adjacent
organs.

[**1-6**] non-con head CT: negative for ICH.

[**1-7**] RUQ US: 1.  Gallbladder wall edema, without any gallbladder
distention.  This appearance is highly suggestive of changes
relating to a non-gallbladder related etiology, such as third
spacing of fluid, or inflammation of adjacent organs.
2.  No cholelithiasis.

[**1-7**] ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

  Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for review) of [**2178-6-2**], the tricuspid
regurgitation is significantly increased.

[**2179-1-9**] CXR: Right central venous catheter has been placed with
the tip in the right atrium and no PTX. A retrocardiac density
remains unchanged. There are no new consolidations and the
pulmonary vascular markings may be subtlely increased versus
prior. Less density over the right lower lung is noted and
likely due to positioning influencing pleural fluid
distribution.

CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2179-1-14**]
1. Unchanged appearance of pacemaker. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
2. Stable left retrocardiac density.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT  [**2179-1-16**] 8:52 AM
No DVT in the left lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 yof pmh CAD, hypothyroidism, h/o br ca p/w
junctional escape rhythm, unresponsive requiring intubation,
hyperkalemic, in severe acidosis and ARF. Temp wire was placed
now unpaced and wire removed. Pt extubated. ARF resolved. Now
with new afib w/RVR. PPM placed on [**2179-1-13**].
.
#Low grade fevers for 2 days (100.3)- Patient completed 1 week
of levofloxacin/flagyl for possible abdominal or pulmonary
infections contributing to her shock on admission. Patient is
three days out from pacer placement. Received 3 doses IV
vancomycin periprocedurally. Pt will complete 7 day course of
keflex in the setting of new pacemaker placed until [**1-22**].
.
## CARDIAC:
#Ischemic - h/o CABG x1 vessel. Pt with elevated enzymes thought
to be secondary to demand. There were no ST changes seen on EKG.
Outpatient BP meds were held in setting of acute renal failure
and junctional escape rhythm (incl atenolol, cozaar, aldactone,
cardizem/cardura). Patient was started metoprolol and cozaar in
setting of afib w/RVR. Continue lipitor.
.
#Pump - Shock most likely either cardiogenic versus septic.
Patient was hypotensive requiring dopamine and levophed drips
despite being positive approximately 4-5L of fluid and fluid
overloaded on CXR. Minimal UOP, fluid third spacing. Hospital
day #2 (HOD #2) patient was weaned off pressors and unpaced in
60's. HOD #3 patient successfully extubated. Given rapid
turnaround more likely cardiogenic shock [**3-11**] combination of
dehydration, renal insufficiency and renally cleared nodal
blockers (bb, ccb). No clear source of sepsis. Corstim test was
negative however given less likely septic picture, stress dose
steroids were held and patient was  monitored closely.

#Arrhythmia - temp pacer wire placed [**3-11**] to junction escape
rhythm/sinus node arrest upon admission. Has had PR prolongation
on past EKGs. Now pacer wire removed and patient in NSR 70's
with PR interval 220. Patient went into afib w/RVR HR 140's
without chest pain on [**1-11**]. Pt started on metoprolol which was
titrated up. EP placed PPM on [**2179-1-13**] to facilitate treatment of
afib by rate controlling agents.

# Acidosis: Initially, mixed gap and respiratory acidosis with
elevated lactate and ARF contributing to anion gap acidosis.
Increased respiratory rate while ventilated, fluid bolused
aggressively and received 4amps of bicarb until pH>7.1.
Patient's acidosis resolved quickly over the course of first
night of admission and was likely secondary to increased
perfusion.
.
# Respiratory compromise: Patient extubated easily. Repeat CXR
suggests retrocardiac atelectasis tx'd with abx. ISS to bedside.
Now on room air.
.
# Abnormal abd findings on CT/?etiology of sepsis: Possible
pancreatitis v duodenitis seen on abd CT. RUQ US was negative
for stones. Amylase, lipase and LFTs wnl. no intrabd free air.
Given negative enzymes, less likely acute abdominal process.
Surgery was consulted, no need for emergent surgery and
recommended outpatient EGD as follow
