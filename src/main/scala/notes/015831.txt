Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB: Patient presented melena of several days duration that
had occured during the previous week.  Last bowel movement was
three days prior to admission. Patient had presented to the ED
on [**2198-2-19**] complaining of melena for which he received a 1 liter
bolus of saline and then left against medical advice.  The
patient returned at the urging of his urologist.  Hematocrit at
baseline on admission.  Etiology unlcear; patient denies alcohol
or NSAID use.  He further denies abdominal pain and has no
history of liver disease.  The patient was started on protonix
[**Hospital1 **] and his heparin was held.  He was placed on telemetry
monitoring and hematocrit was trended.  The patient was seen and
evaluated by GI who felt that the bleeding was likely secondary
to elevated INR.  His hematocrit remained stable, but he
continued to have dark stool that was intermittently mildly
guiaiac positive during the last couple of days of his hospital
stay.  He was greatly bothered by the fact that his stool was
still dark. He was offered colonoscopy but after discussion with
his PCP refused it as an inpatient.

# Leukocytosis: Most likely cause is known CLL given chronicity
of this finding and absence of infectious symptoms. There were
no signs or symptoms of infection; UA was normal and CXR was
without any acute pulmonary processes.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Unclear precipitant, though
empirically would favor pre-renal process superimposed on
chronic DM, HTN related renal injury given is clinically dry.
The patient was given careful fluid resuscitation due to chronic
heart failure.

# DM: Patient was placed on insulin sliding scale while in the
hospital.

# CAD:  Patient has significant cardiac history with coronary
artery dsiease s/p MI complicated by V-fib arres, s/p CABGx4,
s/p ICD.  He was continued on his home Aspirin and Atorvastatin.
Metoprolol, lisiopril and lasix were initially held due to
concern for bleeding causing hypotension and acute renal
failure.

#  Hypophosphatemia:  Patient's phosphorus level was found to be
low on the day of discharge; patient had left hospital by the
time the lab value had returned.  He was called at home and
prescribed two packets of neutraphos for him to take.

# CHF: Patietn has ischemic cardiomyopathy LVEF 10% s/p ICD.  He
was carefully volume repleted.  His home dose of metoprolol,
lisinopril and lasix were initially held due to concern for
blood loss causing hypotension and ARF.
