Fever, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with h/o MGUS, CHF [**2-12**] severe MR/TR (EF >55%), afib not on
coumadin, presents with fever and cough.  Patient is currently
not conversant, therefore details of HPI are obtained from
family.  Per her family, pt was in her USOH until a fall 4 days
ago.  Fall was witnessed, no head trauma or LOC.  She appeared
to be back at her baseline until the following morning when she
developed fevers at home to 101.3 and cough x 2 days. She did
not seek medical attention because she has preferred not to see
a doctor for the past 2 years.  Family notes that she was
generally at her baseline (AAOx3, playing cards), but was
intermittently "out of it" for the past 2 days.  This AM she was
more lethargic, and they persuaded her to go to the ED for
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.0, HR 101, BP 104/58, RR
16, O2 sat 94% 2L.  BP gradually decreased to 80s/50s and she
became increasingly tachypneic, switched to NRB.  Received 1.5L
NS in boluses, SBP increased to 90s.  CXR showed e/o LLL pna.
She was given 2g IV cefepime and 500mg IV levofloxacin.  She was
transferred to MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to MICU vitals were T 102.6, HR 93, BP 73/35, RR 26,
O2 sat 100% on NRB.  Currently she appears awake but is not
conversant. Family states that she was always very clear about
her decision to be DNR/DNI and would not want aggressive
interventions, including central lines or pressors.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain.  To family's knowledge, only notable as
described in HPI.

CXR [**2127-11-3**]:
FINDINGS: Portable AP radiograph of the chest was obtained. Low
lung
volumes. There is airspaze opacity seen over the left mid lung
most likely
representing a pneumonia. There is stable cardiomegaly. The
aorta is
tortuous with calcifications seen in the aortic knob. There are
no pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. Bony structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Left mid lung consolidation consistent with
pneumonia. Recommend followup to resolution.
