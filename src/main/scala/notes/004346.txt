History of Present Illness:
Neurology Consult Note:

CC: fever, neck pain, resp distress, weakness

HPI: 47 M w/ hx IVDA, Hep C, alcoholism, COPD, presented to
[**Hospital **] Hosp with fever, cough, and neck pain. Symptoms began on
Sat 2 days prior when he developed neck stiffness. Nonetheless,
he traveled with his wife to [**Name (NI) 6408**]to gamble. On Sun he
felt worse, but was mostly fatigued and slept in the car ride
back to MA as his wife drove. [**Name2 (NI) **] morning, he began c/o B/L hand
tingling and electric shock pains going down his body. He
developed a fever, and began vomiting and shaking. He thought
that he was withdrawing from EtOH. His last drink had been Sat.
His wife notes that he became diffusely weak and was unable to
walk straight when he tried to walk. His wife brought him in a
wheelchair to [**Hospital **] Hosp, where his temp was noted to be 103
F.
CXR was purportedly suggestive of a mild LLL PNA. NCHCT  at
midnight was normal.  At 2:15 am, [**Hospital1 **] ER reports that he was
c/o B/L UE weakness and ongoing neck stiffness and intact MS. At
2:45, neck pain is reported as [**9-22**]. He had apparently been
dropping his sat and was placed on a NRB. At 2:50 am, O2 sat
noted to be 88% on NRB and though still awake, he was becoming
lethargic. He was felt to require intubation, and was intubated
at 3 am.  Post intubation, though pt appeared to be able to
answer yes/ no and move eyes, he had no withdrawal to noxious
stim in any ext. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and obtained an
emergent MRI pan-spine showing significant epidural fluid
collection, likely blood, possibly infected. There were also
bone
marrow changes of unclear etiology, but possibly c/w malignancy.
Prior to MRI, pt received ceftriaxone, levaquin, and decadron.
Notably, pt comes with CT head and CT-spine reports from [**5-22**]
with an indication for "L arm numbness."
Of note, his wife reports an unintentional weight loss of 100
lbs
over about 3 years. She also notes that he had an HIV test 1
month ago that was negative.

100%intubated
Gen: Lying in bed, NAD
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa
Neck: in c-collar, but appears supple and he spont moves it side
to side.
CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs
Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
aBd: +BS soft, nontender
ext: no c/c/e; equal radial and pedal pulses B/L. Apparent track
marks R antecubital fossa

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: off propofol for 10 min, opens/closes eyes to
command and inconsistently follows command to look left/right.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils pinpoint and min reactive to light bilaterally. Appeared
to have BTT B/L. Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no
nystagmus. Of note, there did appear to be some disconjugate
mvmts and initially felt R eye did not elevate as well as the L,
later they seemed equally full. Acknowledges sensation to LT in
V1-V3.  Facial movement symmetric on grimace.  (+) corneals.

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. flaccid tone throughout.
There is no spont mvmt and no mvmt to noxious stim thoughout.
Later he appears very agitated, grimacing hard and coughing
hard,
yet still no mvmt of any limb

Sensation: No withdrawl of any limb to noxious; also no apparent
grimacing to noxious.

Reflexes:
0 and symmetric throughout.
Toes downgoing on L, mute on R

Imaging:

CXR (my read): R lung base cut off, but otherwise no clear I/E.

MRI pan-spine:
Predominantly posterior epidural collection from craniocervical
junction
through T2, with some signal features that suggest the presence
of blood, i.e.
this could be an infected epidural hematoma rather than just an
epidural
phlegmon. Extensive edema/enhancement in the interspinous
ligaments from C1-2
through C4-5, and in the posterior paravertebral soft tissues of
the cervical
spine, which could indicate traumatic injury or spread of
infection.

Not clear if the epidural collection extends into the skull base
- suggest
head MRI. Cervical spine CT would also be useful to assess for
posterior
element fractures.

Cervical spondylosis, worst at C5-6 and C6-7, with spinal cord
deformity and
abnormal cord signal, could be edema or myelomalacia.

Diffusely abnormal bone marrow signal, could be due to anemia,
chronic
systemic illness, or infiltrative disorder including
infiltrative
malignancy.

No focal thoracic spine abnormalities below T2. Chronic mild L1
compression deformity. Mild lumbar spondylosis. Mild epidural
edema/enhancement surrounding a disc bulge at L1-2, likely
reactive
inflammation as there is no evidence of diskitis/osteomyelitis
at
this level.

A/P: 47 M w/ hx IVDA, Hep C, alcoholism, COPD, with significant
throbmocytopenia, presented from [**Hospital **] Hosp with 3 days neck
pain and 1 day of fever to Tmax 105 F, vomiting, malaise, B/L
hand parasthesiae and shooting electric pains down his body,
found with significant epidural fluid collection from
craniocervical junction to T2, thought to be blood, possibly
infected (which seems likely given raging fever). Exam now seems
c/w quadraplegia, and the acuity of his change can certainly be
seen with epidural abscess. MS at least minimally intact and
CN's
appear intact, though he had some dyscongugate eye movements. He
is being taken emergently to the OR for emergent eploration and
evacuation.

RECS:
Agree with emergent surgical evacuation
F/U cultures (including BCx at [**Hospital1 **]) and broad coverage Abx
Brain MRI w/ and w/o Gad
100 lb weight loss and abnormal bone marrow signal probably
warrant cancer screen
Will follow on consult service
