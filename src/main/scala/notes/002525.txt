Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Latanoprost

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is an 82 year old man (unknown handedness) with
a history of Parkinson's disease, hypercholesterolemia, and
right
hip fracture s/p fall [**2-2**] s/p ORIF who presents with altered
mental status for whom neurology was consulted when head CT
showed a right MCA infarct.

The following history is taken from a nurse ([**Doctor Last Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7233**])
from the [**Hospital3 2558**]. Yesterday, the patient coughed up a
large mucus plug, and was tired ever since then. It was not
documented when the patient went to bed last night. At 6:00 am,
he was able to take his medications normally. At 8:00 am, the
patient wasn't able to take his medications due to difficulty
swallowing and had a productive cough. The charge nurse saw the
patient, and he was still tired but was able to squeeze hand on
the right on cue (but the left hand was not checked) and open
his
eyes, saying a few words ("yes/no"). Vitals were bp 138/70, HR
86, RR 18, FSBG 136, SaO2 88% on RA so was placed on 2L NC which
improved to 91%. Over a 3 hour period, he became less responsive
and wasn't talking as much, and had a low grade temp to 99.9
axillary so labs were ordered given concern for aspiration. They
did not notice any focalities or asymmetry. Per the ED staff,
Narcan was given without response. The ambulance was called and
came at 11:15 pm, and by that time he was completely
unresponsive.

At baseline, speaks in complete sentences slowly and can be
difficult to understand, tries to get out of bed, oriented x2
(not always sure where he is). There have been no recent
medication changes in the past 2 weeks. Of note, he was listed
on
a mechanical soft diet with nectar thickened liquids. He has
been
non-weightbearing since his [**Hospital3 **] discharge on [**2185-2-16**] to
just 2 days ago (was set to start PT today).

Per the patient's ex-wife, he has been coughing a lot more than
usual since Friday.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was an 82 year old man (unknown handedness)
with a history of Parkinson's disease, hypercholesterolemia, and
right hip fracture s/p fall [**2-2**] s/p
ORIF who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with altered mental status and
was found to have a right MCA infarct. He was admitted to the
stroke service from [**2185-4-4**] to the time of his death on [**2185-4-6**].
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
.
#Neuro -
A non-contrast CT of the head done to evaluate altered mental
status revealed a large infarct in the right Middle Cerebral
Artery territory.  The stroke was thought to be secondary to a
large embolic event, possibly in the context of prolonged
immobilization and a patent foramen ovale.  Initial plans were
to obtain a CTA of the head and neck in addition to an
echocardiogram.  However, these tests were not ultimately
performed as goals of care were transitioned to comfort in the
setting of a poor prognosis.
.
#Resp -
On admission the patient was noted to be in significant
respiratory distress, requiring a non-rebreather to maintain
oxygen saturation.  Intubation was discussed but not ultimately
pursued given the patient's overall poor prognosis.  He was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed pneumonia,
and underwent a chest CT to evaluate for possible pulmonary
embolism.  CT showed large multiple bilateral emboli.  However,
given the large cerebral infarct, he would have been at
significant risk for hemorrhagic conversion were he to undergo
anticoagulation.  An IVC filter was briefly discussed.  Since a
filter would not address the significant clot burden or
associated heart strain already present, it was not pursued.
.
#CV -
On admission Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an elevated troponin of
0.13, as well as signs of right heart strain on EKG.  This was
thought to be secondary to the large pulmonary embolism.
.
#Goals of Care -
Extensive discussions were held with the patient's ex-wife, who
was in communication with his daughter and health care proxy.
[**Name (NI) 227**] the patient's overall poor prognosis, the decision was
made to transition goals of care from cure to comfort. He was
transferred to the floor on [**4-5**].  Members of the palliative
care team participated in his care.  On [**2185-4-6**], he died.
