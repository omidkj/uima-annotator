CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2188-6-5**] 10:41 AM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval: pneumatocele
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
30 year old man motorcycle accident known pneumatocele
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval: pneumatocele
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: Motorcycle accident with pneumatocele.

COMPARISON: Chest CT from [**2188-5-31**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the
thoracic inlet through the upper abdomen were obtained without
intravenous contrast. Images were displayed with 5 mm and 1.25
mm collimation.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A small hydropneumothorax
is again demonstrated in the left hemithorax. The amount of
hyperdense fluid within the hydropneumothorax is unchanged since
the prior exam, but there has been interval decrease in the
density of this complex fluid ([**Doctor Last Name **] 30), consistent with evolving
hemothorax. Air within the apical component of the
hydropneumothorax has nearly resolved, but there is a slightly
increased amount of air within the basilar component. A left
chest tube is present with the tip located posterior to the left
upper lobe. The hyperdense bilobed pneumatocele containing an
air- fluid level in the left lower lobe is stable in size and
appearance from the prior exam. The ground glass opacification
surrounding the pneumatocele in the left lower lobe has improved
in the interval, representing resolving contusion. Improved
aeration is present in the right lower lobe, consistent with
improving atelectasis. Additionally, a focal cluster of tiny
ground glass nodular opacities in the posterior right upper lobe
may represent an area of focal subclinical aspiration. The
airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi
bilaterally.

A calcified right paratracheal lymph node is again demonstrated.
No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
nodes are present. Heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
within normal limits. There is interval decrease in the amount
of subcutaneous emphysema within the anterior chest wall and
soft tissues.

In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, no abnormalities are
demonstrated.

Bone windows again demonstrate multiple contiguous displaced rib
fractures on the left, unchanged in the interval.

IMPRESSION:

1) Stable appearance of post-traumatic left lower lobe
pneumatocele with intraluminal hemorrhage. Resolving surrounding
contusion.

2) Small left hemopneumothorax with slight interval increase in
amount of air in the basilar component of the hemopneumothorax,
but near complete resolution of air within the apical component.

3) Improving right lower lobe atelectasis.

4) Focal clustered centrilobular opacities, likely due to
subclinical aspiration in posterior segment of the right lobe
upper lobe.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2188-6-5**] 5:55 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval: PTX (please perform CXR at 19:00)

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
43 year old man with L pneumatocoele, L PTX s/p CT pulled.
(please perform CXR at 19:00)
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval: PTX (please perform CXR at 19:00)
INDICATION: 43-year-old male with left pneumatocele and left
pneumothorax status post chest tube removal. Evaluate for
pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: [**2188-6-4**].

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:

Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and
unchanged. Left apical pneumothorax has decreased in size.
Patient is status post removal of left hemithorax chest tubes.
Left lower lung opacity corresponding with known pneumatocele
and unchanged compared to prior. No focal opacities. Small left
pleural effusion unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in left apical pneumothorax with tiny
pneumothorax appreciated.
2. Unchanged loculated small left pleural effusion.
3. Unchanged left lower lobe opacity consistent with history of
pneumatocele.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. He was intubated in the
emergency room; a left thoracostomy tube was also placed.
Neurosurgery was consulted because of his a small SAH identified
on CT imaging; a CTA revealed no dissection. Repeat head imaging
remained stable. No operative intervention warranted.

Thoracic surgery was consulted because of a pneumatocele and
lung contusions. Serial chest radiographs performed, a chest CT
was also performed and was stable. His chest tube was removed on
HD #7. He will follow up in Trauma Clinic in 2 weeks for repeat
chest xray.

Orthopedic spine surgery was consulted because of finding on CT
imaging of his cervical spine. No surgical intervention; he will
remain in a hard cervical collar for 2 weeks and will follow up
with the Spine surgeon for repeat imaging of his cervical spine.


Acute pain service was also consulted because of his rib
fractures; he was initially a PCA for pain control and later
changed to oral narcotics. His pain is currently controlled with
prn Ibuprofen and Oxycodone. He will be discharged with these
medications.

He was also evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy.
