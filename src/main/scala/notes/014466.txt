Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, on imaging on initial evaluation, he was found to have
a Left TMJ dislocation, a left proximal clavicular fracture, a
right posterior first rib fracture, left upper and lower lobe
opacities (possibly secondary to aspiration), a
periorbital/preseptal right hematoma, a right frontal lobe
contusion, a small right frontal SAH, a left proximal tibial
fracture, a right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a left
parafalcine subdural hemorrhage.

He was admitted to TSICU for frequent neuro checks and repeat
head CTs.  He was taken to the operating room by orthopedics on
[**2161-7-7**] for an ex-fix of his left lower extremity which was
subsequently open reduced and internally fixated on [**2161-7-10**].  He
had some difficulty w/somnolence during post-op period as well
as apnea and resultant hypoxia in the setting of dilaudid for
pain.  He gradually improved in mental status as narcotis were
weaned and was transferred to floor on HD 6.

He was returned to the TSICU on HD 8 after hypoxia to 80s on
floor. CXR on the evening prior to re-admit to TSICU showed
stable moderate pulm edema.  He was intubated, further diuresed,
bronched and continued on antibiotics.  He was ultimately
extubated without incident.

At time of discharge, he was afebrile, tolerating a honey
thickened liquid diet (after a video swallow eval).  Largely
immobile, he will need continued physical therapy needs.

By systems:

Neuro: Head polytrauma as noted above.  Serial head CTs were
done which were initially stable then improving.  Neurosurgery
recommends follow up in early [**Month (only) **] with a noncontrast head
CT.  Please see discharge instructions for further info.  His
mental status improved with time.  His c-collar was cleared on
HD 3 after a spinal MRI did not show evidence of spine defects.
He was dosed intermittently for seroquel for insomnia and
tolerated it well.  Ophthalmology was consulted for the
periorbital trauma and stated injuries were non-operative.

CV: Was initially on pressors then weaned.  Subsequently
restarted on pressors on readmission to the ICU.  His pressor
drips were weaned without incident but he was started on
midodrine for a couple days to support his systolics in the 90s.
 He tolerated it well and was eventually weaned from it without
issue.  At time of discharge he was hemodynamically stable, off
all forms of pressors for several days with no active issues. Of
note, he was on amiodarone per baseline for paroxysmal afib.
This was stopped on [**7-16**] after a few brief episodes of
bradycardia and overall normal heart rate.  This was discussed
with his PCP who recommended discontinuation until follow-up
with him (PCP) at which point he will determine its
recontinuation based on discussion with his outpatient
cardiologist.

Resp: Initially intubated for operating room trips and extubated
without incident.  There was some concern for aspiration early
on but this did not manifest or become a major issue.  Upon
transfer to the floor on HD 6 he was doing overall quite well
then suddenly became hypoxic in the setting of pulling off his
supplemental O2 but also had bilateral rhonchi and a worsening
CXR.  Secretions were cleared with a bronchoscopy and after
several more days of diuresis and careful management of his
fluid status (PRN lasix), he was extubated on [**7-20**] without
incident.  Of note, please see ID section for additional info,
his BAL from [**7-15**] was shown to grow MSSA and he was started on
levofloxacin for an 8 day course - last day to be [**2161-7-23**].  He
was treated with albuterol and ipratropium nebs q6h and as
needed during this hospitalization.

GI: Failed multiple speech and swallow evals early in his
hospitalization.  This was attributed to his mental status and
somnolence.  Ultimately he tolerated POs (especially during his
transfer to the floor).  He was NPO on readmit to the ICU due to
intubation and respiratory issues, then after extubation failed
a swallow eval but passed a video swallow the subsequent day and
was cleared for honey thickened liquids with aspiration
precautions and with supervised feeds.  Lansoprazole (home
regimen) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

GU/FEN: Initially low UOP. FeUrea showed pre-renal picture, was
fluid resuscitated as appropriate.  Had a foley catheter which
was replaced when appropriate.  By time of discharge was making
excellent urine with no active renal issues.  During the
hospitalizaton he had some issues with hypernatremia, with Na as
high as 153. His maintainance fluids were switched to D5W and
his sodium was normal for the final 9 days of his
hospitalization (139 on discharge).  Home dose lasix 20 mg PO
(crushed)was started and we recommend its continuation.

Heme: He was started on fondaparinux (heparin allergy) for
routine DVT prophylaxis in the setting of long bone fractur
