hyperglycemia, R foot pain

right foot I&D

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 100186**] is a 60yo M w/ mental retardation, diabetes
mellitus type II (on insulin), and asthma, who presented to the
ED for hyperglycemia and for evaluation of his R foot pain. He
had gone on a boat cruise over the weekend and did a lot of
walking on Block Island. Upon his return on Sunday (2d PTA), he
noted increased pain in his R foot, with swelling and some
redness. He was no longer able to walk on it and then started to
notice his FS became elevated. His PCP got [**Name Initial (PRE) **] call today from his
VNA case manager who saw the patient in his home today and noted
that Mr. [**Known lastname 100186**] was c/o feeling weak, shaky, and
disoriented. The VNA felt that the patient was SOB, tachypneic,
tachycardic, and had swollen and painful legs bilaterally. His
FS at the time was 325, so the patient was advised to come to
the ER.
.
On arrival to the ER, he was found to be febrile (T 101.1), HR
128, BP 92/63, RR 18, and sats were 96% on RA. Blood cultures
were drawn and IV access was obtained. His first FS was 342, for
which he received 10u SC humalog. He then had n/v which did not
improve with anzemet and ativan. CT scan of abdomen was obtained
and was negative for intraabdominal pathology. He then had
"copious" amounts of liquid green diarrhea. It was collected and
sent for culture, including C diff. Podiatry was consulted and
he was then started on vancomycin and levaquin IV for the
cellulitis. He again had copious amounts of liquid green stool
after receiving the Baracat for the CT scan. He was given his
evening dose of 70/30 (40u) at 2050, but repeat FS at 2200 was
426. He was also febrile to 102.6 at that time, with a HR of 90
and BP 133/68. At that point, repeat labs were sent and showed a
bicarb of 16, with an anion gap of 14. Given that he was
developing a gap, he was started on an insulin gtt at 10u/hr and
he was given additional NS (for a total of 3.5L of NS + KCL) and
was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.

In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] - was treated with insulin GTT and Bs were stabilised,,
there after the patient was tranferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for further
care
