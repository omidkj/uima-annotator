Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
87F with history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2143**], PCI in [**2153**], and
NSTEMI [**9-/2160**] with inability to stent, systolic CHF (EF 25-30%),
ESRD on dialysis (TTS), DM type II, and chronic UTIs with SOB
starting around 9pm this evening. Per d/w pt and daughter she
was feeling well until one day prior to arrival. She woke up her
daughter who called EMS, who noted [**Name (NI) 13866**] > 500 and significant
SOB.  Her symptoms were somewhat relieved by nebulizers.
.
No recent illnesses or triggers. Had a slice of pie this evening
but often does. Took her insulin as she usually does. No
preceding fever, cough, dysuria. Had some diarrhea after HD on
Thursday but often does and this has not continued. Notes that
her FS were normal (100s-200s) until this evening when she had a
FS in the 300s.
.
She also explains that this evening after dinner she had a large
glass of water and some ice chips which was more than her fluid
restriction of 5 cups per day. She is wondering if this is what
set her over in terms of her pulmonary edema.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.8 101 154/76 34 99% on a NRB.
Labs notable for a glucose of 795, AG acidosis of 20, Na 126,
BNP [**Numeric Identifier 4914**] (Last [**Numeric Identifier 17514**] in [**Month (only) **]), WBC 12.8. ECG showed sinus
at 102, old LBBB and CXR showed bilateral pulmonary edema. She
was started on a Nitro gtt and BiPAP, as well as an insulin gtt.

.
At time of transfer VS 95 140/59 97/BipAP 10/5 FiO2 40% on nitro
1 mcg/kg/min and insulin 8/hr.
.
On arrival to the MICU she was on BiPAP and in NAD. She was
requesting ice chips. No other complaints

STUDIES:
( TTE: )
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = XX %). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
( TEE - Pre Cardioversion)
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA/RA/RAA. moderate mitral regurgitation. Complex atheroma
in the aortic arch and descending aorta.
