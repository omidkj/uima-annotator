Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent Large B-Cell Lymphoma admitted for autologous stem
cell transplant.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
autologous stem cell transplant

History of Present Illness:
The patient is admitted for an autologous stem cell
transplantation s/p BM harvesting as she did not have an
adequate peripheral collection.
The paitent was diagnosed in [**2156-9-16**] after presenting
with abdominal pain. Disease confined to the abdomin, stage
IIIB. She is s/p 6 cycles of R-CHOP (last treatment
[**2157-1-6**]),She relapsed 2 months following RCHOP.She was
treated with  R-CHOP x 2 with minimal response, s/p ICE in [**6-21**]
and [**7-21**]. She also was admitted on [**8-2**] for cytoxan and
neupogen for stem cell mobilization. Three peripheral
collections were attempted without sufficient cells. She
ultimately underwent a BM harvest in the OR with successful
colelction of sufficient cells for an attempted autologous stem
cell transplantation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2157-10-12**] 11:42 PM
The heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged when
compared to prior study. There is a new right lower lobe patchy
opacity that could represent early pneumonia. It is very subtle
and was not seen in the prior study. Since it could be from
overlying breast, lateral view is recommended.
IMPRESSION: Possible right lower lobe pneumonia. Lateral view
recommended for further evaluation.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2157-10-23**] 4:47 PM
The previously seen patchy density in the right lower lobe is
markedly improved and almost completely resolved. On one
projection, slight increased density was noted.The bilateral
central venous lines remain in place and there is no
pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascular markings, cardiac and
mediastinal contours are normal.
-Marked improvement versus prior with only minimal residual RLL
vague density appreciated.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2157-11-4**] 10:12 AM
Supine and upright plain radiograph of the abdomen and pelvis
were obtained. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable and there
is no evidence of free air or obstruction. There is no evidence
of organomegaly. Rounded calcifications within the pelvis likely
represent phleboliths. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
-No evidence of obstruction.
.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2157-11-6**] 2:24 PM
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST
CHEST: There is no morphologically significant mediastinal or
hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial or pleural
effusion. In the lung window, note is made of atelectatic
opacities in the lung bases, however, no other consolidation is
noted. The central airways are patent. The evaluation of the
lung parenchyma is somewhat limited due to a motion artifact.
ABDOMEN: Again note is made of 1.7 cm low-density lesion in the
right lobe of the liver, unchanged since prior study, most
likely representing liver cyst. Note is made of small amount of
gallbladder edema with normal enhancement of the mucosa, with a
nondistended gallbladder. Spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
the visualized portion of the large and small intestines are
within normal limits. No significant lymphadenopathy. No
ascites. Again note is made of a low-density lesion in the right
kidney, unchanged since prior study.
PELVIS: The visualized portion of large and small intestines are
within normal limits. There is no ascites or lymphadenopathy.
There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal
structures.
IMPRESSION:
1. NO evidence of pneumonica or abdominal abscess.
2. Mild edema surrounding nondistended gallbladder. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
3. Liver cyst and renal cyst.
4. Basilar atelectasis.
.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-11-9**] 3:45 PM
There are patent nasal-antral ostia, bilaterally. Uncinate
processes are intact, however, and there are no signs of
post-surgical change. The appearance is smooth and symmetric,
suggesting that the appearance may be congenital, or perhaps,
related to remote inflammation. There is minimal mucosal
thickening in the ethmoid sinuses, with slight circumferential
mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus. The maxillary and
frontal sinuses are clear. There are no air-fluid levels to
suggest acute sinusitis. There is a large bony spur associated
with mild leftward deviation of the nasal septum, but the middle
meatus is widely patent. The orbits and surrounding soft tissue
structures are unremarkable. The osseous structures are within
normal limits.
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimal sphenoid and ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening,
without air-fluid levels to suggest acute sinusitis.
2. Patent maxillary sinus secondary ostia, most likely
congenital.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-11-18**] 3:59 PM
New right middle lobe consolidation. Given the fast appearance
during the last 10 days it most likely represents bacterial
pneumonia. Other sources of infection in a neutropenic patient
such as fungal infection, for example aspergillosis or
mucormycosis cannot be excluded. These findings were
communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10351**] during dictation of this exam.

[**11-27**] BAL
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2157-11-27**]):
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR
LEUKOCYTES.
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

   MODIFIED ACID-FAST STAIN FOR NOCARDIA (Final [**2157-11-29**]):
      Test cancelled by laboratory due to lack of branching gram
positive
      rods in the gram stain.
      Gram stain is an equally sensitive means of detecting
Nocardia in a
      primary specimen.
      Culture may be a more sensitive means of detecting
Nocardia and
      should be considered.
