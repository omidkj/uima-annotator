post-operative changes seen in the right frontal lobe. Small
amount of high density material seen in the resection bed,
consistent with post-operative hemorrhage. No evidence of acute
hemorrhage seen elsewhere. Expected pneumocephalus was
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 51136**] is a 57-year-old woman with a history of breast
cancer who was found to have a right frontal brain mass. She was
admitted to the neurosurgery service following her planned
craniotomy and mass resection (see separate operative report).
She was observed overnight in the PACU and did well and was
transferred to the floor on POD#1. Physical therapy evaluated
her on the floor and felt she needed an additional day of PT;
she was thus discharged to home on POD#3.
