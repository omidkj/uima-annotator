Date of Birth:   [**2085-10-3**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old female
with coronary artery disease who presented at an outside
hospital with chest pain, shortness of breath, which started
two days prior and was intermittent.  However, one day prior
to admission, it became constant.  Initially, it was relieved
with nitroglycerin times two.  EMS found her with 5/10 chest
pain.  On route to the outside hospital, she received
nitroglycerin times two and aspirin 162.  She was
tachycardiac with a blood pressure of 120/70.  She was
started on IV nitroglycerin and IV fluids.  The EKG
demonstrated ST elevations in II, aVF, ST depressions in V1
through V4.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Catheterization revealed 70% occluded SVG to RCA with
TIMI-III flow, patent RCA, and patent other arteries.  No
intervention was done.  She received packed red blood cells
and Lasix.  She was then transferred to the CCU.  She
originally presented to [**Hospital3 3834**] and was found to
have a hematocrit of 17.6 down from 30.4 on [**2145-2-10**].  Her
INR at that time was 3.2.  She did have Guaiac positive
stools, at which point she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization with the above findings.

Bactrim, Valium, and erythromycin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married, a former smoker, quit in
[**7-21**].  She denied alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Weight:  110.  Vital
signs:  Heart rate 111, blood pressure 150/67.  General:  She
was a pale, ill-appearing female.  HEENT:  Her mucous
membranes were dry.  She had a left eye which was glass.  No
JVP.  Cardiovascular:  She was tachycardiac with a mechanical
S2.  Lungs:  She had bronchial sounds but no crackles on lung
examination.  Abdomen:  Her abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  There was 1+ dorsalis pedis,
mottled, but warm.  Neurologic:  Unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:  The EKG demonstrated sinus
tachycardia with an old Q wave infarction with ST elevations
in III, aVF which were new, ST depressions in I, V2 through
V5 which were old.

Laboratories on arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated a white
count of 16.9, hematocrit 16.3, platelets 266,000. Sodium
140, potassium 3.8, chloride 102, bicarbonate 27, BUN 47,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 126.  CK 32.  Troponin less than 3.
ALT 9, AST 18, albumin 2.9, amylase 39, alkaline phosphatase
63.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the CCU Service
following her cardiac catheterization.  She was started on
aspirin; however, Plavix was held given the possibility of GI
bleed.  Once her INR was less than 1.8, the heparin was
resumed because of her mechanical mitral valve.  She was
transfused in order to keep her hematocrit greater than 30.
She was started on a beta blocker.

She underwent EGD on [**2145-2-26**] which demonstrated erythema,
congestion, and diminished folds in the stomach, body, and
fundus compatible with gastritis.  Otherwise, it was a normal
EGD to the second part of the duodenum.  At that time, she
was placed on Protonix 40 b.i.d.  NSAIDs were avoided.  She
advanced her diet.  Her hematocrit remained stable.
Therefore, GI was reluctant to do a colonoscopy given peri
MI.

She, therefore, underwent cardiac stress test which was
negative for ischemia.  There was no further chest pain.  It
was thought that this was originally due to demand ischemia
from a dramatically decreased hematocrit.  Therefore, she
underwent colonoscopy.  The colonoscopy was negative for
bleed at that time.  Her hematocrit had been stable for
several days.  She was resumed on her Coumadin but left on
heparin until it was therapeutic.  It was felt that this was
possibly a small bowel bleed with small bowel follow through
if bleeding was to resume.

She was, therefore, monitored in-house on heparin until her
INR was therapeutic, at which point she was transferred to
the Medical Service to await the therapeutic INR of greater
than 2.5.

Additionally, she developed a pneumonia while in-house.  She
was started on Levaquin and remained afebrile and the white
count trended downward.  She was treated for a total of ten
days.  She had no further episode of chest pain during her
hospitalization and, therefore, was discharged home in good
condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 once a day.
2.  Digoxin 0.125 once a day.
3.  Amitriptyline 100 q.h.s.
4.  Calcium carbonate 1.25 b.i.d.
5.  Lopressor 25 b.i.d.
6.  Protonix 40 once a day.
7.  Lisinopril 5 once a day.
8.  Lipitor 5 once a day.
9.  Coumadin 3 mg q.h.s.

FOLLOW-UP:  She was discharged home with follow-up with her
PCP.
