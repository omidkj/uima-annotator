service and was taken to the operating room on [**2109-1-15**] for
three vessel CABG with LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft
to RCA and to OM1.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit immediately
post-operatively.  On postoperative day #1 the patient's Swan
Ganz catheter was removed and the patient was weaned off the
Neo-Synephrine.  On postoperative day #2 the patient noted
some visual disturbances.  Carotid ultrasound studies showed
mild plaque in the left ICA of no hemodynamic significance
and normal antegrade flow in the vertebral artery.  The right
carotid was unable to be seen due to line placement.
Neurology saw the patient and diagnosed her with balance
syndrome.  Physical therapy saw the patient on [**2109-1-18**] and
