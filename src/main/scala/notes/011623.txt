ERCP [**2123-4-18**]:
Small stone and copious amoutns of sludge were found in the
biliary tree.
Normal limited pancreatogram.
A biliary sphincterotomy was performs.
Stone and sludge were extracted using a balloon.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old woman with history of CAD, HTN, DM2, who presented
to [**Hospital3 **] with gallstone pancreatitis and was sent to
[**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP, monitored briefly in the ICU prior to transfer
back to [**Hospital3 **].

ERCP was done under general anesthesia.  BPs dropped from 170s
systolic to 80s with induction of general anesthesia, so small
bolus of ephedrine was given and patient was temporarily placed
on phenylephrine.   Sphincterotomy was performed in the 12
o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing
guidewire.  One small stone and copious amounts of sludge were
extracted successfuly using a balloon. No large stones or
strictures were noted on cholangiogram; it is possible that
jaundice was from obstruction by the small stone.

She was extubated without event and transferred to the Medical
ICU for monitoring post anesthesia.  She was transitioned from
non-rebreather post-extubation to 4L NC upon arrival to ICU.
Her vital signs remained stable, and she was transferred back to
[**Hospital1 392**] in stable condition.

At [**Hospital1 392**], the medical team should watch for complications of
bleeding, perforation, or pancreatitis.  She should remain NPO
for today with diet advanced per primary medical team's
instructions tomorrow.  LFTs should be followed to ensure that
they normalize.
