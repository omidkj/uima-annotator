Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with hypoxemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy (x4)
Y stent placement by interventional pulmonology ([**2155-1-30**])
right thoracentesis ([**2155-1-29**])

History of Present Illness:
85yoW with h/o metastatic thyroid cancer s/p thyroidectomy and
tracheostomy c/b tracheomalacia, also with h/o asthma and
Guillain-[**Location (un) **], discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**2155-1-13**] after admission on
[**2155-1-8**] for trach revision, transferred now from [**Hospital1 **] with
hypoxemia.
.
Patient's history dates back to when she was initially admitted
to [**Hospital 11485**] Med Center [**2154-11-6**] after reaction to antibiotics
and required mechanical ventilation.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] [**2154-12-17**] for trach readjustment.  She was transferred
from [**Hospital1 **]  to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital [**2154-12-19**] where she remained
until transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2155-1-8**]. She was brought to [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital [**2154-12-19**] for intermittent hypoxic respiratory failure
and hypotension due to tracheal obstruction by trach tube with
positional changes.  At that time she was volume overloaded and
diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia.  She is s/p trach x8yrs
complicated by tracheomalacia.  While at [**Hospital1 8**] she was tried
on [**Last Name (un) 295**] 6.5 and Shiley 6.0, but these resulted in air leakage
and subjective distress.  She also tried 7.0 talk trach, but she
did not tolerate that either.  Hospital course was complicated
by MRSA pneumonia, treated with 14days combination Vancomycin
and Linezolid.  She was also treated for E.coli UTI and Staph
epi bacteremia.  Speech and swallow study at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
demonstrated aspiration of all consistencies, and she was fed
via dobhoff tube.  She and her family decline PEG placement. At
[**Hospital1 18**] she underwent bedside bronchoscopy and trach change with
placement of an adjustment 11.5cm [**Last Name (un) 295**] was placed.  Hospital
course then was complicated by hypotension after attept to
increase diltiazem dose from 15 to 30mg, and recurrent trach
obstruction requiring repeat bronchoscopy.  She was diuresed for
volume overload as well.
.
She was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] today after oxygen
desaturations with positional change and inability to bag.  On
arrival to ED T 100.6R HR 100 BP 154/83 RR 14  98% ventilated.
She received doses of vancomycin and cefepime in the ED for
pneumonia given h/o MRSA and pseudomonas.

[**2155-1-27**] Chest CT:
Improved pulmonary edema. Interval increase in bilateral pleural
effusions. Progression of scores of thyroid metastases to the
lungs. Pulmonary hypertension. Moderate calcification in the
aortic valve is of unknown hemodynamic significance. Extensive
coronary calcifications. Chronic right lower lobe and partial
left lower lobe collapse. Secretions in the trachea above the
cuff and in the left lower bronchus. Worsening mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.

.
[**2155-1-27**] TTE: The left atrium is dilated. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
The aortic valve is not well seen. There is mild to moderate
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
.
[**2155-2-3**] CXR: Tracheostomy tube is in standard midline position
within the trachea. With the patient's neck in a flexed
position, the distal tip is approximately 2 cm above the carina.
Feeding tube continues to terminate below the diaphragm. Heart
size is normal and unchanged. Multiple diffuse pulmonary nodules
are present throughout both lungs with a dominant mass in the
right hilum. Moderate sized pleural effusions are present
bilaterally. A superimposed acute parenchymal process, likely
pulmonary edema, shows some interval improvement since [**2-1**], [**2154**].
.
LUE DOPPLER [**2155-2-6**]
Nonocclusive thrombus extending from basilic vein proximal to
PICC, extending to the proximal subclavian vein. Recommend
short-term followup to evaluate for presence of gas bubbles
within the thrombus.
