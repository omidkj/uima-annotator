Pertinent Results:
CT torso [**2124-10-1**] (final):
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis
or aspiration. No pneumothorax.
2. Burst type vertebral body fractures in the thoracic spine and
L1 and L2 transverse processes fractures. MRI could be performed
for evaluation of cord injury.
3. Tiny amount of fluid adjacent to the IVC. This could be
related to IVC injury, although it is not as large as would be
expected given the timeline of patient's accident and current
study. Low threshold to rescan the patient to evaluate for IVC
injury if patient becomes unstable.
4. Colonic mural fat deposition suggests chronic inflammation.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. A 1.3-cm left thyroid nodule. Non-urgent ultrasound is
recommended for further evaluation.
6. A 4 x 2 cm right adnexal cyst and heterogenous appearance of
cervix. The latter may be secondary to blood products from phase
of patient's cycle, but follow-up pelvic ultrasound recommended
to evaluate both findings.
7. Fibroid uterus.
CT maxillofacial [**2124-10-1**] (prelim):
Numerous bilateral facial fractures and left occipital condyle
fracture. Right lateral lamellar fracture includes intracranial
extent, placing patient at risk for CSF leak.
MR T/L spine [**2124-10-1**] (final):
1. As on the concurrent CECT torso, there are acute
burst-compression fractures of the T3, T6, T7 and T8 vertebrae.
These findings are most marked at the T3 and T6 levels, where
there is some retropulsion, effacing the ventral thecal sac
without cord remodeling or compression.
2. No acute alignment abnormality or associated ligamentous
injury.
3. Normal thoracic spinal cord signal intensity through the
conus medullaris.
4. No lumbar vertebral compression fracture; the L1 and L2 right
transverse process fractures are better-seen on the CT.
5. Degenerative disc disease at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 and several
cervical levels, as detailed above.
L wrist films (final):
Distal radial and ulnar styloid fractures.
[**10-2**] CTA: 1. Mild clot burden of acute pulmonary thromboembolus
involving the segmental and subsegmental right lower lobe and
lingular pulmonary arteries. There is mild pulmonary arterial
hypertension without evidence of right heart strain.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis.
3. Diffuse hepatic steatosis. 1.2 cm hypodense lesion is
incompletely evaluated on this phase of contrast-enhanced
examination. This could be further evaluated with liver
ultrasound or dedicated contrast-enhanced liver cross-sectional
imaging.
4. Redemonstration of burst fractures involving the T3, T6
through T8 vertebral bodies as previously mentioned.
[**10-2**] LENIS: No bilateral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
CT abd/pelvis [**10-3**]:
1. Bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis versus
aspiration/infection.
. Fluid adjacent to the IVC is less prominent on today's study
compared to prior examination.
3. Simple appearing free fluid is noted around the right kidney,
new since the prior exam with no evidence of contrast excretion
or renal laceration noted to suggest urinoma or hematoma.
Recommend attention to this region on follow up imaging. If
there is clinical concern, then short interval follow up may be
obtained.
4. Burst fractures of T7 and T8 vertebral bodies as well as L1
and L2

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Acute Care surgery team and was
transferred to the Trauma ICU for closer monitoring of her
sustained injuries.

Her hospital course is as follows per body system:
Neuro: She was transitioned to acetaminophen with Dilaudid for
breakthrough pain after extubation.  A TLSO brace was ordered
for nonoperative management of her T3, 6, 7, and 8 vertebral
body fractures, and a soft cervical collar was maintained for
her left occipital condylar fracture after she was evaluated by
the Ortho spine service. The TLSO brace needs to be worn
whenever HOB is greater than 30 degrees and when patient is out
of bed. She was evaluated by physical and occupational therapy,
and they recommended rehab. At time if discharge, she is alert
and oriented x3, and she can move all her extremities. Patient
will follow up with Ortho Spine in [**3-3**] weeks.

Cardiovascular:  Stable on admission, the patient had recurrent
desaturations with tachycardia on [**10-2**], and given her recent
trauma, high index of suspicion for PE resulted in a CTA which
confirmed bilateral segmental PEs.  On [**2124-10-2**], an IVC filter was
placed. A heparin drip was started and later transitioned to
Coumadin therapy. However, her INR was sub therapeutic so
patient was started on Lovenox bridge prior to discharge. Her
coumadin was continued and INRs were checked daily. On day of
discharge, her INR was 1.5.

Respiratory: She was successfully extubated on [**10-5**] and her
oxygen requirement was weaned. Upon discharge, she was
saturating above 93%-98% on room air.

GI:  Tube feeds were started [**10-3**], and advanced to goal.  She
passed a speech and swallow evaluation after extubation on [**10-5**],
and tolerated a regular ground di
