History of Present Illness:
56M w/diffuse Bcell lymphoma stage IV C2D12 of daEPOCH with
recent line associated RUE DVT on fondaparinux presenting with
palpatations and dyspnea found to have multiple PEs on CTA.
.
Patient recently admitted from [**10-9**] - [**10-14**] for cycle #2
[**Hospital1 **]-R with hospital course complicated by rapid Afib and
provoked RUE DVT at PICC site. Patient discharged on metoprolol
and fondaparinoux.
.
Per patient had been in USOH after return home when 3days prior
to admission developed gradual onset fatigue, palpitations,
constant mild chest discomfort, and shortness of breath. Patient
spoke with heme who initially instructed him to downtitrate his
BB. However symptoms persisted with worsening palpitations and
new onset wheezing. He contact[**Name (NI) **] his primary heme who
recommended presentation to the ED.
.
In the emergency dept, Initial Vitals/Trigger: 98.0 100 112/67
16 100% RA. CTA demonstrated acute pulmonary emboli involving
the right middle and lower lobar arteries,extending to at least
segmental and probably subsegmental level. Also involving to a
lesser extent, the right upper lobar artery. Pulmonary emboli
also involving the left lower lobar arteries. No evidence of
right heart strain, pulmonary infarct, or pleural effusion.
Heparin bolused and gtt begun in ED as pt has missed AM fondux.
No bedside TTE performed. Per heme, ?lysis therefore decision
made to transfer to the MICU.
.
On the floor, patient with persistent "laborious breathing" and
mild chest discomfort but otherwise without complaint.
.

Imaging:
[**10-20**] CTA Chest: IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pulmonary embolis, as above seen extending into the
pulmonary
arteries supplying the right middle and right lower lobes and to
a lesser
extent involving the right upper lobe, as well as the left lower
lobe. No
pulmonary infarct or pleural effusion. No evidence of right
heart strain.

2. 2 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, also seen on recent
prior study of
[**2194-9-13**].

3. Heterogeneity of the ribs bilaterally, stable from prior
study, and likely
reflecting osseous involvement of known lymphoma.

[**10-20**] lower extremity US: IMPRESSION: No DVT.

[**10-21**] upper extremity US: IMPRESSION:
1) Patent right upper extremity veins without evidence of DVT.
2) Possibly duplicated left subclavian vein with thrombosis of
one of the
paired left subclavian veins. Thrombosis of one of the paired
left brachial
veins and the left basilic vein.

Though normal respiratory variation is seen with internal
echogenic internal
jugular vein. The proximal extent of the clot is not well seen
on this study
and further assessment of thrombus noted as well as vein anatomy
can be
obtained by MRV or CTV if indicated

[**10-22**] Echo: IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular
systolic function. No significant valvular abnormality seen.

[**10-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison to the prior chest radiograph
there is no major
change. The lungs remain clear. There are no pleural effusions.
The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There
