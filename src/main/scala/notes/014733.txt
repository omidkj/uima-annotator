Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 80827**] is a 51 yo F w/ h/o ETOH abuse, DM2 who presented
to our ED from OSH with a depressed temporal skull fx with small
amt of pneumocephalus, and who began to withdraw from EtOH while
pt was in ED; also complaining of UTI symptoms.
.
1) ETOH abuse: Pt noted to have symptoms of withdrawal while
being observed in ED.  Pt states that her last drink was on [**7-25**],
however, she has a history of ETOH withdrawl seizure at rehab in
[**2188-5-17**], so she was observed in the ICU.  CIWA scale completed
q2h, with PRN diazepam 5-10mg.  Pt also received folate,
thiamine, MVI.  Did not administer anti-seizure medications
given unclear history of a single EtOH withdrawal seizure.  The
ICU team attempted to contact [**Name (NI) **] re: h/o EtOH-WD-related SZ,
but unable to reach anyone after several tries.  LFTs only with
slightly increased AST consistent with some ETOH damage, but no
cirrhosis. Pt had not recieved diazepam for 12+ hours and had
clear cognition and was not tremulous on exam prior ro d/c.
patient expressed desire to quit her drinking. Social work met
with patient and provided support and contact information for
substance abuse resources.
.
2) Skull fx with small pneumocephalus: Pt noted to have a
temporal skull fx on CT scan, but per neurosurgery, likely old
with no need for acute intervention. Pt did not report sx
associated with skull fracture.  Has neurosurgery follow-up
scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] in 2 weeks. Cephalexin prophylaxis
recommended by neurosurgery given pneumocephalus. She initially
got one dose of ceftriaxone for pssible UTI, but when urine Cx
was negative was switched to po cephalexin. pt given Rx for
cephalexin to complete a total 10 day course (day 1 = [**7-26**]).
.
3) DM: Pt's home metformin was held. It was suspected that her
diabetes wa related to alcohol-induced pancreatic damage rather
than insulin reisstance. She was placed on an insulin sliding
scale. Fasting blood sugars were less than 150s throughout
admission.
.
4) UTI: Pt reported some urinary frequency, and UA was positive
for few bacteria, trace leukocyte esterase, 3-5 WBCs. Pt got one
dose ceftriaxone, which was then d/c when urine Cx was negative.
Pt was not complaining of dysuria, and urinary frequency was
presumed to be [**2-19**] increased po fluid intake.
.
5) Nicotine Abuse: Pt started on a nicotine patch while
inpatient. Continuing smoking cessation was discussed with pt.
Pt expressed that she would like to quit EtOH first and then
subsequently actively work on smoking cessation. Pt has
substance abuse resource information that was provided by social
work.
