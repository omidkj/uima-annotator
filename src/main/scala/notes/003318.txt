Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotrachial intubation
suture of right brow laceration
reduction of nasal fractures


History of Present Illness:
43 yo man with h/o epilepsy, psychogenic polydipsia, mental
retardation with multiple nasal fractures s/p fall who was
electively intubated in the ED due to agitation.
.
Per ED notes, the patient was running to catch a bus, fell down
and hit his face. Upon presentation to the ED, initial VS: 88 18
96%. He complained of severe facial pain and had multiple facial
lacerations. CT scan sinus/head/spine revealed multiple
communited nasal and maxillofacial fractures; no spine fx or
acute intracranial event.
.
Throughout ED course, he was agitated and received in total 25mg
halidol, 10mg ativan. He transiently desaturated to 88% on 100%
NRB with concern for possible aspiration event. Due to continued
agitation, he was electively intubated. Plastic surgery was
consulted and repaired lacerations, reduced fractures. He also
received levofloxacin 500mg x 1 for possible aspiration
pneumonia

Imaging:
MRI cervical spine:
Study is limited due to patient motion. Within this limitation,
there is no definite abnormal cord signal identified.
Specifically, there is no evidence of cord contusion or
extra-axial fluid collection to suggest epidural hematoma. There
is no abnormal STIR signal identified on sagittal imaging to
suggest ligamentous injury or acute fracture. Small amount of
increased fluid signal anterior to the vertebral bodies likely
represents fluid within the nasal and oropharynx due to recent
intubation rather than prevertebral or retropharyngeal edema.
This exam was not tailored for degenerative changes, although
there is no significant canal stenosis identified at any level.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ligamentous injury or cord injury
identified

CT maxillofacial/ mandible/ sinus: B/L Nasal bone fractures with
postero-medial displacement of right sided distal fracture
fragment. Comminuted fracture of the nasal septum with right
sided displacement of fracture fragments. Significant sinus
disease.

CT spine:
No cervical spine fractures. Endotrachial and OG tubes. B/L lung

consolidations consistent with aspiration

CT head w/o contrast:
No hemorrhage, large territorial infarct, or mass effect. Nasal
bone
fractures as described in facial CT.

CXR:
Single AP supine portable view of the chest is obtained.
Endotracheal tube is in place with its tip located approximately
3.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is seen extending into the
left upper quadrant. The lungs appear clear despite low lung
volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Adequate position of the ET and NG tubes


Brief Hospital Course:
43 yo man with h/o epilepsy, psychogenic polydipsia, mental
retardation with multiple nasal fractures s/p fall who was
electively intubated in the ED due to agitation

Nasal and maxillofacial fractures: Presented with communited
fractures of nasal septum that were reduced by plastic surgery
in the emergency department.  A nasal splint was alos placed and
keept in place until [**10-22**].  Per plastic surgery
recommendations, patient was placed on 7 day course of augmentin
to end [**10-26**].  Maintained sinus precautions i.e. nothing by
straw, avoidance of nose blowing, sneezing with open mouth,
throughout hospitalization.  Follow up arranged with plastic
surgery as an outpatient.

status post mechanical fall: Presented following a mechanical
fall with multiple lacerations and nasal fractures (see above).
Patient was placed in a cervical collar until c-spine was
cleared by CT spine and MRI (performed due to inability to
clinically clear given underlying mental retardation and
sedating medication side effects).  Intubated in emergency
department due to agitation for laceration repair and reduction
of fractures.  Trauma team followed patient with secondary and
tertiary survey and determined no further evidence of injury.

status post intubation: As above, patient intubated in emergency
department mostly due to agitation.  Reportedly had episode of
hypoxia to 88%  on 100% NRB in the ED in the setting of
agitation.  Although there was initial concern that this may
have represented aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, no
clear infiltrate was seen CXR and vent settings were able to be
weaned quickly.  Sputum cx did grow GPC in chains and clusters
and patient was continued on augmentin per plastic surgery
recommendations for laceration/ nasal fractures.  Patient was
extubated without difficulty and had no further oxygen
requirements.

Mood disorder: per ED, agitated and violent, requiring multiple
sedatives and eventual intubation.  Patient was restarted on all
of his home medications (risperidol was substituted for home
paliperidone while intubated due to inability to give down
orogastric tube).  Following extubation, patient required no
further doses of ativan or halidol.
