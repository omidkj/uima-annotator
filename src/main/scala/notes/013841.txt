[**2100-10-6**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain and

[**2100-10-6**] CXR: There is a persistent left basal effusion. There
is stable cardiomegaly. The right lung is clear. There is a
pacemaker with the tip in the right ventricle. There are no
focal pulmonary consolidations. Right apical atelectasis /
collapse noted. Please correlate clinically.
.
[**2100-10-7**] ECHO: The left atrial volume is markedly increased
(>32ml/m2). The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= XX
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mildly depressed LV systolic dysfunction. Thickened
aortic valve leaflets without stenosis. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 89 year old male with medical history
pertinent for prior stroke and chronic indwelling Foley
complicated by recurrent UTI in setting of bladder diverticula
and possible chronic fungal infection, who now presents from his
extended care facility with 3 days of lethargy. (At baseline the
patient is reported to have expressive aphasia with right facial
droop). The patient has been admitted multiple times previously
with similar symptoms of lethargy which has been secondary to
recurrent UTI. The patient on admission was not noted to have
fevers/chills or abdominal pain. On admission from the ED the
patient was with vitals as follows: T 99.2; BP 140/73; HR 73; O2
sat 100%RA. While in the ED the patient dropped his pressure as
low as 73/37 with improvement after fluids.
     [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: In the ICU the patient was initiated on
therapy with broad spectrum coverage with Zosyn and Vanc.
Microbiology review reveals the patient has had recurrent
infection with E. Coli, Morganella Morganii, Group B Strep, and
Enterococcus. The dominant organism has been E. Coli which has
been quinolone resistant, Zosyn undeterminate (although most
recent report states sensitive), sensitive to Cefepime,
Ceftriaxone. Urology was consulted with impression that the
patient is not an operative candidate for his bladder
diverticulum given his medical co morbidities. A CT Head
revealed no acute pathology, the patient was ruled out for MI
and impression is that patient's agitation and delirium is from
his underlying infection. The patient on admission to the ICU
was noted to have somnolence alternating with agitation
consistent with delirium for which he received intermittent
doses of Haldol.
   During the ICU course the patient's antihypertensives were
held given concern for possible urosepsis as patient had low BP
on arrival. The patient's BP is reported to have recovered with
fluid, did not require repeated boluses or pressors for pressure
maintenance. Additional review of micro data reveals that the
patient had [**12-21**] blood cultures positive for Enterococcus from
the ED although ICU note reports 1/4 bottles positive with
impression of skin contaminant. He initially received broad
spectrum treatment with Vancomycin & Zosyn. This was narrowed
down to Ampicillin. The patient will require 14 day course IV
antibiotics for complicated UTI, PICC placed, He will finish
treatment on [**2100-10-23**]. Nitrofurantoin for suppressive tx should
be resumed later. He had TTE without vegetation in ED (performed
for different indication), risk/benefit in this patient does not
favor TEE.
    Dysphagia with signs of aspiration were noted. We
recommended PEG tube placement, however they decided not to have
it placed. The son understands that his father will not meet his
nutritional needs and hydration needs with potential
developement of dehydration, hypotension, and hypernatremia.
They will reconsider it again if has difficulties at the nursing
home. Chem7 should be checked at the nursing home to prevent the
developement of hyperna
