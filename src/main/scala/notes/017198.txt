Brief Hospital Course:
Pt presented to the ED on [**2115-11-28**] with multi-day history of
increasing abdominal pain.  Pt found to have CT demonstrating
thin-walled, dilated (up to 6 cm) appendix consistent with a
mucocele of the appendix or any cystic neoplasm. The patient has
severe coronary artery disease. At the time of his presentation
he was believed to be having active chest pain. Over the course
of the five days he has ruled out for myocardial infarction and
was treated with cipro/flagyl/vanc. His right lower quadrant
symptoms diminished somewhat but he still was distended and had
right lower quadrant peritoneal findings, including rebound
tenderness and guarding.  His cardiac risk was recognized but
the risk of sepsis and bowel obstruction as well as the
possibility of underlying carcinoma warranted surgical
intervention.

Pt's cardaic treatment was optimized during his stay in the
TSICU. Cardiology recommended beta blocking the patient to goal
heart rate of less than 70.  We discontinued diltiazem. We did
not agree to increase lipitor to 80 owing to the hypo-immune
effects of low cholesterol. We continued asa and plavix, and
diuresed the patient with a goal output of 500cc-1 liter per
day.  The pt was stable on this regimen in the pre-operative
period.

After preparation, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a right colectomy with
resection of his right lower quadrant mass on [**2115-12-3**] without
complications.  He tolerated this procedure well.  He was
transferred to the TSICU directly from the OR, and was extubated
on the evening following surgery without complication.  On the
following morning he was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9 for recovery.
 Cardiology participated in his post-operative care. They
recommended the continuation of his pre-operative medications
with the addition of isosorbide mononitrate and that he have
definitive follow up in one week post-discharge.

Post-operatively, Mr. [**Known lastname **] rapidly regained bowel function and
was given a diet on POD 2.  He advanced to a regular diet by the
following day with passing of flatus and stool.  At the time of
discharge he was afebrile, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating
without assistance and with clearance from physical therapy, and
with good pain control on PO medication.  Pt's wound site was
clean, dry, and intact, without any signs of infection.
