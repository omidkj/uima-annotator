REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient is admitted for a
potential liver transplant.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old
male with HIV diagnosed in [**2115**] with advanced HCC who was
recently evaluated for a hepatic mass. He was status post
chemoembolization of hepatic mass at [**Hospital1 2177**] in the setting of
elevated AFP. CT scans have shown hepatic mass with question
of thrombus in adjacent hepatic vein. CT-guided biopsy of the
involved area did not show tumor. Repeat CT in [**2131-11-18**]
was unchanged. He was subsequently listed for liver
transplant for advanced liver cirrhosis and unresectable HCC.

viral load. On [**2131-12-19**], CD4 count was 245. HCV was
diagnosed 5-6 years ago. History of upper GI bleed,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, polysubstance abuse,
sober since [**2128**]. History of CVA in [**2129-8-17**] with
residual right leg weakness. DVT. Per report, able to walk 1-
2 blocks prior to claudication.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Pravachol 10 mg daily, Diovan 40
mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, Reyataz 300 mg daily, Pletal
150 mg b.i.d., Viread 300 mg daily, Pepcid 20 mg daily,
cilostazol 50 mg daily, thalidomide 50 mg q.h.s., Videx 250
mg daily, vitamin E 400 international units daily, vitamin C
and multivitamins.

ALLERGIES:  Lisinopril with which the patient gets mouth and

fevers, chills, rigors. He denies a change in bowel function.
No change in urinary symptoms. He denies headaches, visual
changes. He reports right leg weakness which is baseline. He
denies chest pain shortness of breath. Recent echocardiogram
in [**2131-7-19**] demonstrated ejection fraction of greater
than 60%, no ventricular septal defects, mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

EXAMINATION:  General: The patient is comfortable in no acute
distress. HEENT anicteric. No nystagmus. Mucosa are clear, no
lesions,. No lymphadenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally, no CVA tenderness. CV is regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender and nondistended, no organomegaly.
Extremities - no C/C/E, no calf tenderness. Pulses are 2+ AT
and dorsalis pedis. Neuro exam - cranial nerves II through
XII are intact. Upper extremities are [**3-21**] throughout
bilaterally. Right lower extremity is [**1-20**] proximally. No
deficits in the left lower extremity.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, his labs were the following:
WBC of 4.1, hematocrit 33.8, platelets 145, sodium 137, 3.3,
105, 23, BUN and creatinine of 16 and 1.6, glucose 90. AST
was 118 and ALT 72. Alkaline phosphatase was 229. Total
bilirubin is 1.5. INR is 1.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient went to the OR on [**2132-1-21**]
in which the patient had a cadaveric liver transplant,
piggyback, portal vein to portal vein anastomosis, common
hepatic artery to common hepatic artery, QDA branch patch,
bile duct to bile duct performed by Doctors [**Last Name (Titles) 816**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3446**]. Please see operative note for more details
of the surgery. The patient had 2 [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains placed to the
right quadrant area, one underneath the right lobe of the
liver and one underneath the liver hilum. The drains were
secured to skin with nylon sutures. The skin was closed with
staples. The patient was transferred, still intubated, to the
intensive care unit in stable condition. The patient was kept
intubated, placed on insulin, Unasyn, ganciclovir, heparin,
MMF and Solu-Medrol 500 IV x1. Ultrasound was performed the
same day demonstrating unremarkable duplex Doppler ultrasound
of the transplanted liver. The patient had a chest x-ray
status post liver transplant for NG tube placement which
demonstrated moderate layering right pulmonary effusion and a
small left pleural effusion. There was a left lower lobe
atelectasis/consolidation.

On the following day, the patient had another ultrasound with
confirmed vascular flow which demonstrated a 13.7 x 7 x 11 cm
subhepatic hematoma, moderate ascites, patent hepatic
vasculature, no evidence of hydronephrosis. The patient was
extubated on postop day 1. LFTs on [**2132-1-22**] were the
following: AST 1324, ALT 566, alkaline phosphatase 126. The
patient was on a Lasix drip. The patient was waiting for
clears. HIV medications were held and subcutaneous heparin
was restarted. It was noted on the chest x-ray on [**2132-1-26**] that the patient had a new right lower lobe infiltrate,
most likely representing pneumonia. In the appropriate
clinical setting, could also represent aspiration or
pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient was started on caspo, levo
and the patient was reintubated for a gas of 7.45, 28, 60, 18
and -4. Dobbhoff was placed for tube feeds. The patient's
antibiotics were changed to Zosyn and vancomycin. Renal and
ID were consulted. On [**2132-1-26**], a bronchoscopy was
performed in the ICU for a presumed diagnosis of pneumonia.

The patient continued to be intubated, sedated with propofol,
p.r.n. morphine, treated for right pneumonia. The patient
continued on tube feeds. Caspo and levofloxacin were started.
The patient extubated on [**2132-1-28**]. The bronchial
washings on [**2132-1-26**] demonstrated that the Gram stain
showed 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes, no microorganisms
seen. Respiratory culture was negative with no growth.
Legionella culture was not isolated. Fungus culture was not
isolated. There was no acid-fast bacilli seen on direct smear
nor concentrated smear. Viral culture for cytomegalovirus is
pending. The patient was seen by physical therapy who felt
that the patient would be an excellent candidate for rehab.
On [**2132-1-30**], the patient had the following labs: WBC of
15.1, hematocrit of 36.6, platelets 222, sodium 146, 3.7,
111, 21, BUN and creatinine of 69 and 2.9, glucose 106. AST
was 35, ALT 63, alkaline phosphatase 101, total bilirubin of
4.0. The patient had an AFP of 711. On [**2132-1-30**], the
patient had an ERCP demonstrating that there was a normal
distal pancreatic duct. The cholangiogram revealed a non-
dilated native and donor bile duct. A bile leak was seen at
the level of the anastomosis. The intrahepatic ducts appeared
normal. A 10-French 8 cm Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was
placed successfully across the anastomosis into the donor
bile duct and bile was seen draining into the duodenum.

On [**2132-2-1**], the patient returned to the OR for re-
exploration after liver transplant, abdominal washout, Roux-
en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and a wedge biopsy of the liver
performed by Doctors [**Last Name (Titles) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) 816**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **]. Please see
operative note for more details of the procedure. Of note,
the old JP drains were removed and two fresh [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains
were placed, one directly underneath the right lobe of the
liver and the other below the biliary anastomosis. The
patient was transferred still intubated to the postop
recovery area. The patient was seen on [**2132-1-31**] by
neurology because of residual right leg weakness and
difficulty with ambulation. They felt that his weakness could
be mechanical due to irritation from pneumo boots. However,
he does have significant weakness in his distal right leg and
they felt that because of the liver transplant, it is
possible to have worsening of old deficits like his residual
stroke. There were no other recommendations per neurology and
they had signed off from the consult. On [**2132-2-6**], the
patient had a routine postop cholangiogram demonstrating
patent hepaticojejunostomy and anastomosis with normal
appearance of the hepatic ducts. There was no extravasation
of the contrast. The patient ha
