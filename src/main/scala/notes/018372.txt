CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2128-9-1**] 2:09 AM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: FEVERS, ABDOMINAL DISTENTION,N/V,ABD PAIN;

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with fevers, abdominal distention, n/v,
abdominal pain, lactate of 4.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please r/o acute process.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 76-year-old man with fevers, abdominal
distention, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain. Rule out acute
process. The patient is status post laparotomy on [**2128-8-22**].

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left. The liver is normal, without focal
lesions. No intra - or extra- hepatic ductal dilatation. There
are multiple gallstones. Otherwise, the gallbladder is
unremarkable. There has been interval placement of a gastrostomy
tube. The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
unremarkable.

There is dilatation of several loops of small-bowel that has
decreased in caliber in the interval. Contrast is seen through
to the colon. There is a small amount of intra-abdominal free
fluid abutting the anterior abdominal wall in the region of
prior surgery. There is induration of the mesenteric fat.

The celiac and SMA are widely patent.

CT OF THE PELVIS: There is a Foley catheter within the urinary
bladder. The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable. No
pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.

No suspicious osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval decrease in degree of small-bowel dilatation
post-surgery. No evidence of mechanical obstruction.

2. Gallstones.

3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

76 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
sp and sw
STUDY: Video oropharyngeal swallow.

INDICATION: 76-year-old male with difficulty swallowing. Please
evaluate.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW EXAMINATION: An oral and pharyngeal
swallowing video fluoroscopy was performed today in
collaboration with the speech and language pathology division.
Various consistencies of barium including thin liquid and
pudding were administered.

FINDINGS: There was severe oral phase deficiency. Initiation of
swallowing was significantly delayed. Premature spillover of the
oral contents is identified. There is an inconsistent mild
swallow delay. Penetration was observed with thin liquids but no
aspiration was identified.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2128-8-30**] 2:29 AM

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)

Reason: Please r/o acute process.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with distended abdomen and no bowel sounds.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please r/o acute process.
INDICATION: Distended abdomen with no bowel sounds. Rule out
acute process.

COMPARISON: [**2128-8-29**].

FINDINGS: There has been no marked interval change. A single
dilated small bowel loops is present in the right upper quadrant
measuring 3.5 cm, nonspecific. A few air-fluid levels are
present on the lateral decubitus image. The colon is normal
caliber and contains stool and contrast from previous study.
Skin staples left of midline and drainage catheter is present.
No free air is present under the diaphragms on upright.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2128-8-29**] 10:42 AM

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)

Reason: abd pain

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with abdominal pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
abd pain

STUDY: SUPINE ABDOMEN [**2128-8-29**].

HISTORY: 76-year-old man with abdominal pain.

FINDINGS: There are skin staples seen along the left abdomen.
There is a gastrostomy tube identified. There is air and stool
seen throughout the colon and rectum. There are few air-filled
loops of small bowel within the mid abdomen which is
nonspecific. This is not significantly changed since previous.
There is no definitive evidence for free air on this limited
supine radiograph. Bony structures are grossly intact.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)

Reason: abd pain

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
abd pain

STUDY: SUPINE ABDOMEN [**2128-8-29**].

HISTORY: 76-year-old man with abdominal pain.

FINDINGS: There are skin staples seen along the left abdomen.
There is a gastrostomy tube identified. There is air and stool
seen throughout the colon and rectum. There are few air-filled
loops of small bowel within the mid abdomen which is
nonspecific. This is not significantly changed since previous.
There is no definitive evidence for free air on this limited
supine radiograph. Bony structures are grossly intact.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Eval for effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with abd distention, fevers, N/V, code sepsis,
possible aspiration. s/p ex lap
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval for effusion
EXAMINATION: AP chest.

INDICATION: Fevers, sepsis.

A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2128-8-23**] at 0810 hours
and is compared with the prior mornings radiograph. The patient
has been extubated. Allowing for the change in technique and
penetration, there likely has been little significant change in
the appearance of patchy airspace disease in the right lung and
left lower lobe. Findings would be consistent with focal
pneumonia possibly secondary to aspiration. A right-sided
subclavian line has its tip projecting over the SVC.

IMPRESSION:

Evidence of airspace disease in the right lung and to a lesser
extent the left lower lobe with frank consolidation in the right
lower lung field. Findings would be consistent with multifocal
pneumonia or aspiration which is not significantly changed since
the prior examination.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2128-8-21**] 2:30 PM

PORTABLE ABDOMEN; ABDOMEN (LAT DECUB ONLY) LEFT
