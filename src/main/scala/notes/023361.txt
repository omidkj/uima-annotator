Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoglycemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
83yo man with complicated medical history including CAD s/p
CABG, Afib, CVA, systolic CHF (LVEF 25% by TTE [**7-7**]), DM2 with
peripheral neuropathy, PVD with R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, upper GI
bleed, anemia felt to be of chronic disease, who presents from
rehab with diarrhea, lethargy, and persistent hypoglycemia in
the setting of sulfonylureas. The patient was in USOH, other
than some loose stools over the past week or so, when he noted
acute onset weakness and fatigue after finishing breakfast.  He
denied CP, N/V, SOB, palp, diaphor, or LH.  The symptoms
persisted until he came to the ED, afterwards, he reports they
resolved, and he felt fine upon arrival to the ICU.  ROS
otherwise negative for cough, SOB, DOE, CP, abd pain, dysuria,
orthopnea, PND.  He notes that the LE edema is stable since he
saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PCP) a few weeks ago, and that his weight this AM
was 204 lbs, which is about where it's been lately.  He was
given all of his meds at rehab. Per EMS report, his FS glucose
was as low as 36, and he was given 2 1mg glucagon, and PO
glucose, with improvement to 62.  He was sent to the ED, where
his initial glucose was 50.
*
In the ED, he was given multiple injections of D50, with little
improvement in FS.  He was then started on octreotide gtt for
treatment of presumed medication (sulfonylurea) induced
hypoglycemia.  He was given Vanco 1g, then seen by vascular for
evaluation of his foot and recommended holding antibiotics.  He
was admitted to the ICU due to frequent fingerstick requirement
for the hypoglycemia. FS in the ED were 74 up to 222 prior to
leaving for the floor.  He was trace guaiac positive in ED, with
brown stool.
*
Previous hospitalization (from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 88368**] note [**2110-1-27**]):
Pt p/t [**Hospital1 18**] ER on [**2109-12-18**] with "feeling lousy," weak and mildly
SOB, was found to have anemia lower than baseline (hct 25) and
some mild CHF, guaiac negative.  He had a CTA done to r/o PE,
which it did, though it noted a RUL nodule and apical scarring
concerning for TB.  He was put in isolation and had 3 sputums
negative for AFB on smear, cultures still pending today [not
available in OMR]. PPD was negative as well.  He had a X-ray and
then MRI of his R foot to investigate a non-healing ulcer, and
was found to have osteomyelitis for which he underwent a R TMA.
He had ARF in setting of contrast dye for CTA, which resolved
over his hospital stay (back to bl 1.2-1.3). He also had low plt
counts, with a Hematology consult suggesting was from his
carvedilol, which was stopped and changed to metoprolol. He had
a HIT Ab sent that was positive, though the subsequent serotonin
release assay (gold standard) was normal, meaning he likely does
not have HIT. His plt count improved from 100k to 153k prior to
discharge. His anemia was felt [**1-3**] chronic inflammation, as his
B12, folate and iron studies were unrevealing.  His blood sugars
were running low, so his glimepiride was decreased to 2mg [**Hospital1 **].
*
When seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2110-1-27**], he was noted to be 20 lbs
above his 'dry weight' of 195 lbs. He was restarted on lasix
40mg, with plans to have follow up labs drawn in 1 week.
Anticoagulation was again addressed for his afib, which the
patient declined given his difficulty with GI bleeding, as well
as difficulty following his INR. His Fe supplements were
stopped, as he was not found to have iron deficiency anemia at
the time (Ferritin > 700).


Past Medical History:

3. Peripheral vascular disease followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], status
post right femoral bypass graft; R TMA last admission
4. Atrial fibrillation, not on anticoagulation secondary to GI
bleed.
5. Hyperlipidemia.
6. Type 2 diabetes with complications of neuropathy and likely
nephropathy, unclear if he had retinopathy.
8. MSSA bacteremia recently thought to be from right foot ulcer.

9. Peptic ulcer disease.
10. Umbilical hernia status post repair.
11. Status post gallbladder removal.
12. History of CVA with mild left-sided residual weakness.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1662**] is an 83-year-old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG,
DM, Atrial fib, CHF (EF 25%) and PVD s/p right transmetatarsal
amputation who presented with fatigue and lethargy and was found
to be hypoglycemic. His brief hospital course by problem is as
follows:
.
1. Hypoglycemia. This was attributed to a sulfonylurea effect in
the setting of poor clearance from renal impairment. This
resolved with octreotide and dextrose. He was admitted to the
ICU given the need for frequent fingersticks, but he did not
have any hypoglycemic symptoms after his admission and his
sugars remained fairly well controlled. His glimepiride was held
while he was an inpatient and he was covered with a regular
insulin sliding scale. On discharge, he was instructed to take a
lower dose (1 mg [**Hospital1 **] instead of 2 mg qam and 1 mg qpm); this may
need to be adjusted back up since his renal function is
improved.
.
2. Fatigue. This was most likely due to his hypoglycemia.
Cardiac enzymes ruled out an MI; a small leak was consistent
with his renal failure and the enzymes went down from there.
.
3. Acute Renal Failure. This was attributed to being pre-renal
in the setting of diarrhea combined with ongoing Lasix use. His
Lasix was held while he was admitted and restarted at half his
usual outpatient dose at the time of discharge. His ACE
inhibitor was also held. *** This should be resumed as an
outpatient. *** His creatinine returned to near his baseline by
discharge.
.
4. Positive blood culture. He had 1/4 bottles from his admission
cultures grow Gram-positive cocci; speciation was pending at the
time of discharge. As he was afebrile without a leukocytosis, it
was believed that this was a contaminant. Nonetheless, if he
should develop a fever, he should be recultured and covered with
antibiotics.
.
5. CHF. He did not appear to be in overt failure, although he
did have an elevated JVP and some crackles in his lungs. As
above, his Lasix and lisinopril were held due to his kidney
