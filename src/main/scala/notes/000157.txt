History of Present Illness:
HPI: 74 y/o male with hx of CAD, HTN, s/p PM for sick sinus
syndrome, CRI s/p nephrectomy who was recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] [**2124-1-18**] now returns from OSH after being intubated for CHF,
initially hypotensive after lasix given then became hypertensive
and also found to have + blood from NGT.
.
During previous admission patient admitted for abdominal pain
underwent EGD and c-scope and found to have multiple
diverticulae and gastritis.  Shortly after EGD patient had
respiratory failure was intubated thought to be [**1-14**] CHF,
extubated the next day.  Patient also thought to have NSTEMI
which was medically managed and patient eventually discharged
[**2124-1-18**].
.
Patient presented to OSH with presumed CHF after being
hypertensive and was intubated.  Per daughter patient missed his
blood pressure medications the day of admission.  Patient denies
any fever,chills, coughs or gradual SOB prior to event.  He
recieved lasix at home and then en route however still SOB in ED
so was put on Bipap and then intubated.  During his admission at
OSH his BP has been labile with hypertension SBP 190s.  Patient
started on nitro gtt for BP control and got lopressor 5mg x3.
At OSH CXR showed initially diffuse infiltrates c/w pulmonary
edema vs PNA; repeat CXR the following day showed improved
infiltrates.  Patient's peak TropI was 1.8 and CK 68 at OSH.
EKG done at OSH showed pattern c/w LVH and more pronounced ST
depression in lateral leads.  Repeat EKG done on arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**] was similar to old EKGs.  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] patient on
minimal vent support with well controlled BP on nitro gtt.

.
P-MIBI ([**2124-1-27**]):
No anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG for ischemia.
There is a mild fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior
and inferolateral walls.  The left ventricle is moderately
dilated at stress and rest and there is global hypokinesis with
a calculated LVEF of 35%.
.
TTE ([**2124-1-24**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2). Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) eccentric mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Renal ultrasound (with Dopplers) [**2124-1-24**]:
2.0 cm cyst of the right renal lower pole.  Otherwise, normal
appearance of the right kidney with patent vasculature and no
son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of
renal artery stenosis. Surgically absent left kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41957**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU intubated.  Upon
arrival, he had a favorable ABG and wsa quickly extubated
without difficulty.  His BP was intially controlled with a
nitroglycerin drip which was slowly weaned off over the first
night of his hospitalization.  On the morning of hospital day
#2, he became acutely short of breath with acute development of
pulmonary edema at the same time that his blood pressure
suddenly rose to 220-240/100-120.  He was given IV Lasix and
metoprolol and his nitroglycerin drip was quickly titrated back
up.  He was put on BiPAP with improvement in his oxygenation.
Over the course of the day, he was weaned easily off BiPAP.  The
focus at this point became controlling his hypertension which
was done with a high dose of Toprol XL, increasing his dose of
Imdur, and starting him on amlodipine.  He was temporarily
controlled on PO hydralazine but this was titrated off due to
his history of poor medication compliance.  His history of a
nephrectomy precluded the use of an ACEi or [**Last Name (un) **].  As far as
working up the etiology of his refractory hypertension, a renal
ultrasound showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis and a
random cortisol level was within normal limits; a 24-hour urine
collecion had normal levels of VMA and metanephrines.  For his
presumed coronary artery disease, he underwent a pharmacologic
stress test which showed only a mild fixed defect in the
inferior/inferolateral walls along with an LVEF of 35%.  He was
discharged home to stay with his daughter with plans to follow
up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of cardiology.
