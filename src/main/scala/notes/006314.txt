CT HEAD:  There is no sign of a fracture or abnormal alignment
of the cervical spine. The vertebral body and disk space heights
are normal in size. There is no evidence of prevertebral soft
tissue swelling. There is a small anterior likely osteophyte at
the anteroinferior corner of the 6th cervical vertebrae, likely
secondary to degenerative changes. The visualized outline of the
thecal sac appears unremarkable, however, please note that CT is
not able to provide any intrathecal detail.
