Please note this is an interim discharge dictation summary.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
with severe congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of less than 15%, diabetes, and four admissions over
the last five months for acute congestive heart failure
exacerbations.  She presents with acute onset shortness of
breath and chest pain which began at 1 A.M. this morning.
She reports feeling short of breath starting right around
1:00, and was unable to return to sleep.  Shortness of breath
got worse until around 3:30, when she reports having intense
chest pain across the precordium, with no relief by
sublingual nitroglycerin x 2.  At that time, she was
diaphoretic and nauseous as well.  She reports no
palpitations, no dizziness or lightheadedness at the time.

EMS was called and arrived at the scene.  Her initial vital
signs were a blood pressure of 156/80, heart rate 120,
respiratory rate 24, with oxygen saturation of 100% on
non-rebreather.  Her oxygen saturations dropped to 88%.  She
was bagged with a rebound of oxygen saturation back to 99 to
100%.  She received lasix 80 mg intravenously x 1, sublingual
nitroglycerin x 4, and morphine 6 mg.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department, the patient initially had an oxygen
saturation of 93% while being bagged with 100% FIO2.  She was
given lasix intravenously x 2, aspirin, additional 2 mg of
morphine, and intravenous nitroglycerin was initiated.  She
was started on CPAP 10 and 5 with improvement of her
shortness of breath.  At that time, her chest pain also
resolved.  An arterial blood gas was done, which showed
7.30/51/440.

She was then admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Intensive Care Unit
for respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring.

Her past cardiac history includes a transthoracic
echocardiogram in [**2146-8-17**], which showed an ejection
fraction of less than 15%, severely depressed left
ventricular function, severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis, normal right ventricular wall motion, and 2+
mitral regurgitation.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts was performed in [**2147-5-17**] for symptomatic bradycardia, showed normal sterile
fashion between 63 and 79 throughout the two and a half week
duration.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 95.8, blood
pressure 110/55, heart rate 57, respiratory rate 12, oxygen
saturation 99% on BiPAP 10 and 5.  General:  The patient is
an elderly woman in mild respiratory distress, on [**Location **]
ventilation.  She is alert and oriented.  She is able to
answer questions appropriately.  She is mildly diaphoretic.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Her pupils were equal,
round and reactive to light.  She is anicteric.  Jugular
venous distention was seen to the jaw.  Her neck was supple.
Cardiovascular examination showed a regular rate, normal S1,
S2.  She had a II/VI holosystolic murmur at the left lower
sternal border.  Her chest had coarse crackles bilaterally
three-quarters of the way up.  There was no wheezing present.
On abdominal examination, her belly was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  There were normal active bowel sounds. Her
extremities had 1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
bilaterally, with trace pitting edema from the foot to the
ankle.  On neurologic examination, cranial nerves II through
XII were intact.  There was no gross motor or sensory
deficit.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white count 14.4, hemoglobin
13.2, hematocrit 37.6, platelets 33.2.  PT 13.7, PTT 28.1,
INR 1.3.  Chemistry:  Sodium 123, potassium 4.5, chloride 90,
bicarbonate 22, BUN 18, creatinine 1.0, glucose 300.
Urinalysis on admission was negative.  Urine culture as well
was negative.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with worsening
interstitial edema as compared to previous admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE TO DATE:
1.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient was admitted
[**2147-7-22**] to [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Intensive Care Unit for congestive
heart failure exacerbation.  Her presentation was very
similar to her last four admissions over the last five
months.  She was diuresed aggressively.  She was ready for
discharge on hospital day number two when it was noted that
she was in first degree AV conduction delay.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] Coronary Care Unit on [**2147-7-24**]
secondary to arrhythmias (see below).

Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit, she immediately
became short of breath, complained of chest pain, was
tachycardic to 120s, later followed by bradycardia down to
the 30s.  She became progressively tachypneic, with
desaturations, and she was electively intubated.  At the
time, it was thought that she was having acute (flash)
pulmonary edema.  She was extubated after two days, on
[**2147-7-26**], however, was reintubated the following day on
[**2147-7-27**] secondary to shortness of breath, chest pain and
tachypnea.

She was taken for cardiac catheterization on [**2147-7-28**] (see
below), and a Swan was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.  It
was noted that her PA diastolic pressures were elevated to
the 40s.  She was continued on aggressive diuresis.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**7-26**] showed an ejection
fraction of 20% with a follow-up echocardiogram on [**8-8**] after
revascularization which was unchanged.

Between [**7-28**] and [**8-1**], numerous attempts were made to
wean the patient to pressure support ventilation and each
time failed due to desaturations and tachypnea.  She was
extubated for the second time on [**2147-8-2**], but reintubated
within 45 minutes secondary to tachycardia to 150s,
ventricular fibrillation, desaturations to 80% while on face
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] agitation.  Although at that time she had been
aggressively diuresed with appropriate response in her PA
diastolic pressures, it was thought that she still was volume
overloaded, and reintubations were secondary to flash
pulmonary edema.  Therefore, she was further diuresed and
extubated for a third time on [**2147-8-5**].  At the time
