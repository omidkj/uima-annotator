Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfonamides

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9598**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 85 yo woman with h/o lymphoma who presents s/p
fall at home. The patient has reportedly experienced a low grade
fever and increased fatigue over the past three days and
unsteadiness on her feet. Last night, she attempted to sit on
the toilet and only recalls coming to lying on back with her
head resting on a pipe.

She pressed the emergency button and EMS arrived on scene. The
event was unwitnessed, she does not recall feeling light headed,
having any chest pain or palpitations or blurry vision,hitting
her head, any seizure activity, aura or post ictal state or loss
of bowel or bladder control. She does have prior history of
falls, most recent five years ago.On one occaision she had
suffered a SAH following a mechanical fall. She is unable to
give clear hx regarding her other falls but does state that she
had fallen on a hot day.

She has a hx of EBV driven B and T cell proliferation-probably
angio-immunoblastic lymphoma and is s/p 6 cycles CHOP completed
[**10-16**] currently in remission. She had presented with LAD in neck
in [**2165**] with CT showing multiple lymph nodes and biopsy cervical
lymph node showing an atypical lymphoproliferative disorder,
highly suggestive of evolving T-cell lymphoma. Subsequent
inguinal biopsy in [**5-16**] was interpreted as either EBV expressing
large B cell NHL or angio-immunoblastic lymphoma with an EBV
expressing malignant B cell clone. She underwent 6 cycles of
R-chop completed in [**10-16**]. PET/CT on [**2169-11-14**] showed no evidence
of disease.

In the ED, the patient's VS were T 99.3, BP 105/35, P 91, O2 96%
on RA. She had a CT Head and Neck, which did not show any
evidence of ICH or fracture. She had a CXR, which was negative
for PNA, CHF, with trace fluid in R fissure, no pleural
effusion. She was initially placed in ED Obs, where she was seen
by PT and found to be orthostatic (SBP 140 to 80s). She received
1L IVF. She was admitted to medicine for further workup and
evaluation.

On floor, patient had a low grade temp to 99.4 and rigoring.

CXR ([**3-23**]) -  IMPRESSION: Apparent enlargement of the left
atrium for which clinical correlation is advised. Mild
interstitial coarsening which could be related to interstitial
disease or may be exaggerated due to technique.

CT Head ([**3-23**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process. No displaced fracture.
2. Stable age-related involutional change, small vessel ischemic
disease.
3. Mild paranasal sinus disease.

CT C-Spine ([**3-23**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture within the cervical spine.
2. Mild multilevel degenerative disease. Stable minimal C7 on T1

anterolisthesis.

MRI Head ([**3-25**]) - CONCLUSION: No evidence of intracranial
lymphoma. Two small foci of old hemorrhage in the right frontal
and temporal lobes.

CT C/A/P ([**3-25**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Numerous new mediastinal, hilar, axillary, retroperitoneal,
intraabdominal, mesenteric, pelvic, and inguinal enlarged
abnormal lymph nodes are consistent with recurrent lymphoma.
Mildly increased size of the spleen.
2. Wall thickening with surrounding fat stranding of the
ascending colon,
hepatic flexure, and proximal transverse colon, consistent with
colitis.
Etiologies include infectious, inflammatory, and ischemic.
Clinical
correlation is recommended.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Small
intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites, new since prior exam.

[**Month/Year (2) **] ([**3-27**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2169-7-7**], the mitral
regurgitation may be somewhat reduced.

Bone Marrow Bx ([**3-28**]) - SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE
BIOPSY:
DIAGNOSIS: - HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH ATYPICAL T-CELL DOMINANT
LYMPHOID AGGREGATES, SUSPICIOUS FOR BONE MARROW INVOLVEMENT BY
T-CELL LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE PROCESS (SEE NOTE)

Bone Marrow Bx Cytogenetics ([**3-28**]) - INTERPRETATION: No clonal
cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 20 metaphases
analyzed from this unstimulated specimen. This normal result
does not exclude a
neoplastic proliferation. Mosaicism and small chromosome
anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods
employed.

[**4-1**] CT Head: No acute intracranial process as clinically
questioned. If there is concern for lymphoma, an MRI of the
brain may be obtained for further characterization.

[**2170-4-4**] CXR: 1. Worsening moderate pulmonary edema.  2.
Increased pleural effusions, large on the right and small on the
left.

[**2170-4-5**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular
response. Left axis deviation. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing the rate is slower.

[**2170-4-9**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-7**], the
cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bilateral pleural
effusions persist. Indist
