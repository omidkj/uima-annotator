The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The
cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Prominent left epicardial
fat pad is present. The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening
of the diaphragms re-demonstrated compatible with patient's
history of COPD. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits
without evidence of pulmonary
edema. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is demonstrated. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is present. The osseous structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. COPD.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 28070**] is an 82 year old woman with history of severe COPD
(on 4L NC at home), diabetes, obesity, presenting with
respiratory distress consistent with COPD exacerbation, in fair
condition.

#. COPD EXACERBATION: Patient with well known COPD and poor
functional reserve with decreased FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratios.
Infection appears most likely diagnosis for etiology of
exacerbation.  She was most recently treated in [**Month (only) **] with Avelox
and steroids, improved.  She also has a history of pseudomonas
infection in [**2147**]. Baseline sats 92 per pt.  Initial chest x-ray
as above without evidence of infiltrate.  Most likely this
represents worsening bronchitis causing inflammatory response.
Started on IV Solumedrol for flair and she was started on
Levofloxacin and Vancomycin empirically until culture data
returned.  Sputum culture grew out coag+ staph on [**4-22**].  Given
her improvement, the lack of infiltrate on CXR, lack of findings
consistent with an aggressive pneumonia such as one would find
with MRSA, this was felt to be a contaminant.  She was then
transferred out of the ICU for further monitoring. On the floor,
her vancomycin was discontinued and she was transitioned to oral
steroids. She was discharged on 1 more day of levofloxacin to
finish 5 day course. She was also given a 2 wk steroid taper and
instructions to follow up with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the time of
discharge, she was on her home requirement of 4L NC.

#. DIABETES: Glucophage was initially held in case of need for
contrast.  Once more stable, her Glucophage was restarted.  She
was also on an insulin sliding scale for supplemental glucose
control given her steroids as above.

#. SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA / AVNRT: Well controlled on
Verapamil, has not had any symptomatic episodes or procedures
for this.  Was initially on short acting until it was clear she
was hemodynamically stable.  She was then continued on her home
dose of Verapimil 180mg SR [**Hospital1 **].

# ANXIETY: On ativan daily at home, 0.5mg TID.  While inpatient,
continued to have significant anxiety and this was increased to
0.5mg QID PRN.

#. HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continued hormone replacement at her regular
dose of Levothyroxine 100mcg daily.
