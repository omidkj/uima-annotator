HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 83-year-old female
with past medical history significant for glaucoma,
rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, ventral hernia, renal cyst, and
right hip replacement, and bowel obstruction with multiple
lysis of adhesions, who presented to the Emergency Room on
[**2162-12-7**] complaining of left sided abdominal pain with loose
bowel movements and vomiting.  The patient reported this low
grade abdominal pain over the past few weeks, but had
worsening pain over the past 1-2 days prior to admission.

Patient also noted decreased appetite prior to her admission.
She denied fever, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain,
or sick contacts.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Glaucoma.
2. Rheumatoid arthritis.
3. COPD.
4. Ventral hernia.
5. Renal cyst.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Bilateral hip replacements.
2. Appendectomy.
3. Bowel obstruction status post multiple lysis of adhesions.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Xalatan eyedrops.
2. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Prednisone 1 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 101.6 with a heart
rate of 99, blood pressure of 200/97, satting 99%.  She is
alert, awake, and oriented.  Her heart is regular.  Her lungs
are clear.  Her abdomen is soft with some hyperacute bowel
sounds and tenderness mostly in the right lower quadrant with
no rebound or guarding or calf tenderness.  Her extremities
are warm, no edema.

LABORATORIES:  White count on admission of 22.  Lactate of
2.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated in the
Emergency Room.  A CT scan was obtained, which does not
reveal any significant explanation for her abdominal pain.
The patient was admitted, made NPO, and hydrated.

On hospital day #1, the patient was seen to have an acute
abdomen.  She was taken to the operating room and underwent
an exploratory laparotomy as well as an extended right
colectomy to the distal sigmoid with an ileosigmoidostomy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Postoperatively,
she was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit.  She was
hydrated.  Her elevated lactate decreased.  Vascular Surgery
consult was obtained given the concern for ischemic bowel,
which is seen in the operating room.  They were not concerned
about any risk for ischemia and they recommended continuing
antibiotics with fluid resuscitation.

The patient's postoperative course was notable for
thrombocytopenia.  She was ruled out for HIT antibody.
Patient was transferred to the floor on [**2162-12-12**].  Patient
had progressively rising white blood cell count on the floor
as well as diarrhea.  She was continued on antibiotics and
ruled out for Clostridium difficile.

On the evening of [**2162-12-18**], the patient was noted to have
increasing abdominal pain and a base deficit on her blood
gas.  On the morning of [**2162-12-19**], her abdominal examination
was significant for rebound and guarding.  She was taken for
an emergent CT scan, which showed free air.  Given her
elevated white count, free air, distention and tenderness,
she was taken to the operating room.

Vascular Surgery consult was also obtained given the fact
that on her CAT scan her aorta and SMA seemed to be
atherosclerotic.  Intraoperatively, the patient was found to
have several small perforations of the small bowel.  This
area of distal ileum was also seemed to be ischemic.
Therefore, the patient underwent resection of her distal
small bowel and ileostomy and a SMA stent was also placed.

The patient was taken to the recovery room, resuscitated.
Infectious Disease as well as Vascular and Cardiology
continued to follow the patient.  Her postoperative course
was remarkable for difficulty to wean from the vent with
large amount of secretions, but over  her ICU stable able to
diurese the patient and wean her from the ventilator. She
also had increased ostomy output, but with tincture of opium
and Imodium, and her tube feeds, were able to decrease her
output.  She did fail a swallow evaluation, and therefore was
on tube feeds and was NPO.

Otherwise, the patient had no major postoperative
complications or events.  She received aggressive pulmonary
toilet and dressing changes to her abdominal wound as well as
Physical Therapy.  On [**2163-1-11**], given the fact that the
patient was doing well, tolerating her tube feeds with
decreased ileostomy output, it was decided that she was
stable for discharge.  She was discharged to rehab in stable
condition.

1. Latanoprost eyedrops 0.005% one drop at bedtime in each
eye.
2. Miconazole powder b.i.d. as needed.

10. Opium 10% tincture 20 drops/liter of tube feeds.
11. Loperamide 1 mg/5 mL one/liter of tube feeds.
12. Diphenoxylate atropine 2.5-0.25 mg/5 mL 10 mL/L.
13. Flagyl 500 mg q.8. to end on [**2163-1-15**].
