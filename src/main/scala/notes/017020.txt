Pertinent Results:

.
Radiology -
CXR -
1.  COPD.  Probable cardiomegaly.  Chronic changes, including
biapical scarring and left- sided volume loss and pleural
thickening.
2.  Multiple calcified nodes suggesting prior granulomatous
disease.  This may also account for the biapical scarring.
3.  Plaque-like calcification along the left hemidiaphragm,
suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.
4.  Distortion and mild dilatation of the trachea, unchanged.
5.  Doubt superimposed acute process.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 80 y.o. Cantonese male with 3 days of SOB and productive
cough most likely due to tracheobronchitis.
.
# SOB - This was initially thought to be likely flash pulmonary
edema in setting of HTN.  He was treated with steroids,
azithromycin, nebs, and bipap.  DFA was sent and negative.  CXR
was sent and revealed 1. COPD.  Probable cardiomegaly.  Chronic
changes, including biapical scarring and left- sided volume loss
and pleural thickening. 2.  Multiple calcified nodes suggesting
prior granulomatous disease.  This may also account for the
biapical scarring. 3.  Plaque-like calcification along the left
hemidiaphragm, suggestive of prior asbestos exposure. 4.
Distortion and mild dilatation of the trachea, unchanged.  His
symptoms improved in hours but he developed afib (se below).
Influenza DFA was sent and negative.  He was sent to the MICU on
the day of admission for tachypnea (RR in 30s) for observation
and then transferred to medicine without event on HD #1.  He was
then presumed to have tracheobronchitis and placed on
azithromycin, prednisone and nebs.  He did well on the floor
with no further desats on nasal cannula.  Azithromycin was
discontinued prior to discharge as was prednisone. In the end,
he was thought to have had a probable COPD flare that resolved
with steroids and antibiotics.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: EP was consulted.  Dilt was started.
[**12-24**], was going to go to CCU for chemical conversion but then
converted on own.  We started Warfarin and he was discharged
with VNA support for INR checks.  He remained in NSR for the
duration of the hospitalization.  He was also discharged on
Diltiazem.
.
# HTN - Patient was not been taking any medications at home for
his HTN for the past 3 months. prior to admission.  Titrted up
ace-I and notified VNA to assist with medication compliance.
Also spoke with family re: importance of these medications prior
to discharge.  His BP was 170/64 on day of discharge.
.
# EKG changes - ST changes likely due to LVH on admission.  CPK
was elevated but trop flat.  He was considered ruled out after 3
sets of enzymes.  He had no CP and as per above, converted to
NSR on HD #4.
.
# Elevated INR (1.9 pmn admission) - The etiology of this was
unclear, ? poor nutrition vs. chronic liver disease w/ hx of
heavy EtOH use.  LFTs were normal, and this resolved prior to
discharge.  He was sent on Coumdain with an expected elevation
in INR pending (see above).
.
# Urinary frequency - Negative U/A.
.
#hematuria: Mod blood in urine on first u/a which resolved by
second u/a.
.
# Hyponatremia - SIADH due to pulmonary disease.  Resolved with
fluid restriction.
.
# Contact - Wife does not speak english, called daughter [**Name (NI) **] at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59701**] or son Vi at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 59702**]
.
# Disp to home with VNA and scheduled follow up one day post
discharge with PCP
