Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
cc: weakness on left side, double vision

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary vein isolation


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 54 yo M with hx of DM, CAD s/p CABG in [**2139**], AF, HL s/p
elective ablation for AF p/w chest pain, L-sided weakness and
double vision.  With his AF, he describes symptoms of fatigue,
SOB, chest tightness and anxiety, and has symptoms almost every
other day with rates > 100.  He has had multiple admissions with
lopressor treatment, and undergone catheterization 8-10 times
for his chest tightness, most recently in [**2145**] at MWH, which
were reportedly clear.  He received a cardiac MR on [**1-18**] in
preparation for pulmonary vein isolation, which showed a normal
EF and mild biatrial enlargement.  He subsequently was admitted
on [**1-22**] for elective pulmonary vein isolation under general
anesthesia and was doing well post-operatively when he suddenly
stopped responding to questions at ~3:30 PM.  He reported
burning chest pain with R shoulder soreness.  Repeat EKGs showed
no acute ST changes.  Received SL NTG x1 without improvement.
He received a dose of morphine 4mg for this and during the
infusion became sleepy, difficult to arouse and not moving his
extemities at all.  He was given 0.4 mg Narcan and was noted to
be weak in his L arm and leg with double vision in his L eye by
the neurology stroke team.  He was taken for emergent CTA which
showed no evidence of arterial occlusion.  A subsequent MRI
showed no evidence of acute stroke.  Neurology felt that this
could medication effect vs seizure.  He was transferred to the
CCU for further monitoring.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
[**2148-1-18**] Cardiac MR
1. Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and systolic function.  The LVEF was normal at 66%.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The RVEF
was normal at 55%.
3. The diameters of the ascending aorta and arch were normal.
The diameter of the descending thoracic aorta was mildly
increased.  The main pulmonary artery diameter was also mildly
increased.
4. Mild biatrial enlargement. (L atrium - 48 mm parasternal long
axis, R atrium - 52 mm)
5. Normal size and orientation of the pulmonary veins without
CMR evidence of anomalous pulmonary venous return or pulmonary
vein stenosis.
6. Normal coronary artery origins with no evidence of anomalous
coronary arteries.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-1-22**] 5:30 PM

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Evaluate for CVA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with h/o AF s/p Ablation p/w new neuro deficits.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for CVA
MRI EXAM OF THE BRAIN

CLINICAL INDICATION: Neurologic deficit, evaluate for CVA.
Patient has undergone ablation for atrial fibrillation.

Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain was
obtained. The study is significantly degraded by motion
artifact. No prior exams were available for comparison.

There is minimally increased signal seen on diffusion images
involving the lower aspect of the medulla. This could be
artifactual in nature or related to possible small infarction.
FLAIR images were significantly degraded by motion artifact and
could not confirm the suspicion of this finding. The ventricular
system is symmetrical without hydrocephalus. There is no midline
shift. Signal flow voids are noted along the intracranial
portions of the carotid arteries.

IMPRESSION: Significantly limited exam by motion artifact. No
cerebral infarcts were seen. There was however suspicion for a
tiny area of restricted diffusion involving the left aspect of
the lower medulla. This might be artifactual in nature or
related to a small subacute infarct. Further followup is
suggested by obtaining repeat diffusion images and conventional
images of the brain preferably after sedation if possible.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2148-1-22**] 3:55 PM

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST

Reason: change in mental status, r/o new CVA, or hemorrhage
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with question of acute bleed or stroke
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
change in mental status, r/o new CVA, or hemorrhage
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM:

CLINICAL INFORMATION: ? acute bleed or stroke. Change in mental
status.

TECHNIQUE: Pre- and post-contrast multislice CT from skull base
to vertex during arterial phase of contrast enhancement with
multiplanar MIP and 3D reformats.

FINDINGS: There is moderate arterial wall calcification at the
cavernous portions of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally,
without significant luminal narrowing. The circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and
its principal tributaries otherwise demonstrate normal caliber
and tapering. No critical stenosis, aneurysm, or vascular
malformation can be seen within the scanned volume.

There is minor opacification involving the ethmoidal air cells,
sphenoid, and left maxillary sinus, likely to be
infective/inflammatory in origin.

CONCLUSION: Minor arterial wall calcification at the cavernous
portions of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally, without
significant luminal narrowing. No other significant
abnormalities.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Per neurology, PLEASE DO DWI ONLY, do NOT need to do
MRA. T

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with L sided weakness after EP procedure
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Per neurology, PLEASE DO DWI ONLY, do NOT need to do MRA. Thank
you.
INDICATION: Left-sided weakness after EP procedure. Evaluate for
infarction.

COMPARISON: Motion limited MR of the head of [**2148-1-22**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial T2, FLAIR and susceptibility
images were obtained, in addition to diffusion-weighted images
of the brain.

FINDINGS: There are no areas of restricted diffusion on today's
exam to suggest acute infarction. There is no shift of normally
midline structures. The ventricles and cisterns are normal.
There is a small focus of susceptibility within the left
occipital lobe. As there is no hyperdense region in this locale
on recent CT scan of [**2148-1-22**], the finding likely represents an
old hemorrhagic residue. Otherwise, the signal of the brain
parenchyma is normal. Normal flow voids are seen within major
circle of [**Location (un) 431**] tributaries.

A lipoma is noted within the left parotid gland, and is
partially imaged.

IMPRESSION: No definite areas of restricted diffusion on today's
