Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible Sigmoidoscopy

History of Present Illness:
67yo female with uterine CA s/p XRT complicated by procatitis
and rectal ulcer.  Pt received multilpe XRT tx for uterine CA in
[**2134**] and had subsequently underwent resection (incomplete) for
vaginal recurrence.  Pt had initially noticed some rectal
spotting as early as [**2134**] subsequent to receiving XRT treatments
for her uterine CA, however due to her pressing cardiac issues
had not paid it much mind.  The patient underwent a flexible
sigmoidoscopy in [**2136-7-5**] which showed severe radiation
change in rectum and sigmoid and areas of active bleeding within
the rectum which were treated with bipolar coagulation of the
bleeding.  The patient subsequently underwent another
sigmoidoscopy in [**2136-8-5**] which found an area of nodular
thickened mucosa on the anterior wall of the rectum about 5-7cm
from the anal verge.  The bleeding was thought to be secondary
to radiation change and or infiltrating recurrent uterine cancer
submucosally and was treated with bipolar coagulopathy.  The
patient was in her usual state of health until Thurs, after
[**Holiday **], pt had noticed some brisk bleeding from the rectum
which were described as bright red clots coming by the handful.
She went to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 41987**] Medical Center where she was found
to have stable vital signs, and Hct of 32.8.  She was given
1unit PRBC and admitted for observation and bed rest.  On [**12-1**], the patient reported increased bleeding, now described as
gushing out when sitting down on the toilet to go urinate.  The
bleeding was no longer clots but now flowing bright red blood.
The patient was given another unit of PRBCs and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation.

AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST [**2136-12-2**] AT 8:15 AM: The most recent
prior study that I have for comparison is a study dated [**2134-10-12**].
There has been interval placement of a bipolar pacer. The
patient is in failure with gross pulmonary edema.

[**2136-12-3**]: A-V paced rhythm 50 bpm
Pacemaker rhythm - no further analysis
Since pervious tracing, no significant change

[**2136-12-4**]:  Colonoscopy
Findings:
 Excavated Lesions A large >3 cm ulcer with active oozing of
blood was found in the distal rectum. Hemostasis and tissue
destruction were successfully achieved with argon plasma
coagulation.
 Other Extensive telangiectasis with active oozing of blood was
visualized up to 30 cm into sigmoid colon. Hemostasis and tissue
destruction at sites of most active oozing were successfully
achieved with argon plasma coagulation.
Impression: 1. Ulcer in the distal rectum and extensive
telangiectasis with active oozing of blood was visualized up to
30 cm into sigmoid colon. These findings are consistent with
radiation proctocolitis.
2. Hemostasis and tissue destruction at sites of most active
oozing was successfully achieved with argon plasma coagulation




Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 67yo female with uterine CA s/p XRT complicated by
procatitis and rectal ulcer who now presents with BRBPR.
.
1.  GI Bleed: She was initially sent to the ICU for monitoring.
She did not have any active bleeding and her vital signs and
hematocrit were stable.  She was transferred to the floor on
[**2136-12-2**] for further management.  She underwent a flexible
sigmoidoscopy on [**2136-12-4**] which showed an ulcer in the distal
rectum and extensive telangiectasis with active oozing of blood
up to 30 cm into the sigmoid colon.  The most active lesions
were coagulated with an argon plasma laser.  A repeat
sigmoidoscopy as an outpatient was scheduled for [**2136-12-12**] for
further plasma coagulation.  Post procedure, she passed several
clots and hematocrit dropped four points, and this was expected
per GI.  She had no brisk rectal bleeding and was otherwise
hemodynamically stable. She was discharged to home with strict
instructions to return immediately if she developed further
bleeding prior to her scheduled GI appointment.  She was advised
to stop all Aspirin/NSAIDS.
.
2.  CV:
A)  Coronaries:  The patient has a significant CAD history
including multiple catheterizations, stent placements and CABG
in past.  Her Aspirin was held.  Her long acting beta= amd
calcium channel blockers were switched to shorter acting.
B)  Pump: The patient also has a known history of CHF with EF of
50% (however with 3+MR).  Her lasix was initially held on
transfer to the floor.  She then developed shortness of breath
with wheezing and was in mild acute heart failure.  This
improved quickly with diuresis, upright positioning, and oxygen.
 She was therafter maintained on lasix and remained euvolemic
for the rest of her hospitalization.
C)  Rhythm:  Pt has a history of afib but is currently in NS
with a pacemaker.  She was continued on amiodarone.
.
3.  DM:  The patient has DM I.  Her NPH dose was halved while
NPO and covered with HISS.
.
4.  CRI: The patient's creatinine remained within her baseline
throughout the admission.
