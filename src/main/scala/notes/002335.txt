Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 54770**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of severe
COPD on home oxygen, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis
who presents from rehab with hypoxia and shortness of breath.
She was discharged from this hospital on [**2195-12-30**] at which time
she was requiring 60% face mask high flow O2 to maintain oxygen
saturations of 88-90%.  She was initially discharged to [**Hospital1 **]
where she showed rapid improvement with antibiotics and after
one month was discharged to [**Hospital1 2436**] and finally to Admiral
[**Doctor Last Name **] nursing home on [**2196-2-24**].  At that time she was requiring
between 3-4 liters nasal canula to maintain saturations in the
high 80s to low 90s at rest.  The events of today are unclear.
She reports that she was trying to get to the dining [**Doctor Last Name **] and
had to walk around the facility.  This was significantly more
exercise than she typically gets.  She sat down and felt short
of breath.  She was wearing her oxygen at the time.  Her oxygen
saturations were noted to be in the 70s on 5L nasal canula.  She
was not experiencing any fevers, chills, cough, congestion,
lightheadedness, dizziness or chest pain.  She was experiencing
significant nasal congestion.  She received a nebulizer therapy
by EMS and by the time of arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] here oxygen
saturation was 96%.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 97.7 BP: 120/50 P: 60 R: 20 O2
sat: 96% on nebulizer. She had a CXR which showed bilateral
pleural effusions and possible bilateral pneumonia although not
significantly changed from her previous films.  She received
ceftriaxone, azithromycin and levofloxacin.  She also received
nebulizers and solumedrol.  She had an EKG which showed atrial
fibrillation but no acute ST segment changes.  She was satting
in the mid 90s on 50% facemask.  She was admitted to the ICU for
further managemen.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU she reports that she feels well.  She is
hungry.  She denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria,
leg pain or swelling. She endorses nasal congestion but no cough
or sore throat.  She does not completely recall the events of
today.  All other review of systems negative in detail.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 54770**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a
history of severe COPD on home oxygen, diastolic heart failure,
and kyphoscoliosis who presents from rehab with hypoxia and
shortness of breath.

Shortness of Breath/Hypoxia:  While in the ICU patient appeared
not particularly far from baseline. It was suspected that her
relative respiratory decompensation was due to a large component
of COPD exacerbation possibly from viral upper respiratory tract
infection.  Condition exacerbated by known bilateral effusions,
chronic RLL collapse and restrictive lung disease from
kyphoscoliosis.  Her CXR was difficult to interpret but was not
significantly changed from prior films.  She had no fevers,
chills, or leukocytosis.  She does not have increased sputum
production.  She has no signs and symptoms of cardiac ischemia.
She did not appear significantly volume overloaded on exam.
Patient given dose of levofloxacin and then antibiotics were
discontinued as bacterial infection was not believed to be
driving force behind symptoms. She was initiated on prednisone
60mg qd with standing alb/ipratropium nebs.  A BNP was done
which was 1655 which was acually below her baseline.  She was
quickly able to be called out to the floor.  Her respiratory
symptoms gradually improved and she was tapered to 40mg
prednisone on day of discharge with plan to continue slow taper
on discharge.  She was continued on her home dose of lasix. Her
home acetazolamide was discontinued due to concerns about
increasing C02 production in a pt with already low reserve from
COPD. Her 02 sats were in high 80s to mid 90s, even during walks
with PT and she was stable on her home dose of 3.5L NC 02.

Diastolic Heart Failure:  Most recent echocardiogram in [**2194**]
actually with hyperdynamic left ventricle and normal LV wall
thickeness.  She was continued on her home dose of lasix,
acetazolamide discontinued as above.

Atrial Fibrillation:  Chronic, on coumadin and beta blockers at
home. Her INR was supratherapeutic while hospitalized, her
coumadin was held until day of discharge, at which time it was
restarted at home doses for INR of 2.0.  Her heart rate was
increased in AF necessitating increase in her beta blockade with
good effect, stable BP.

Anxiety: Stable.
- continued celexa
- continued buspar
- continued PRN ativan

Anemia:  Chronic, normocytic to macrocytic.  At baseline.
- monitored hematocrit, was stable.  Iron deficient by labs,
discharged on iron.
- B12, folate WNL

Seen by speech language pathology due to concerns about coughing
with meals, was placed on a soft dysphagia diet with thin
liquids.

After PT eval and recommendation, pt discharged with stable
vital signs and baseline oxygenation to short term rehab.
