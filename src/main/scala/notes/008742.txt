History of Present Illness:
68 y/o F with CLL presented to [**Hospital1 2177**] ED with fever and jaw pain.
At OSH, pt seen by dental who did not feel there was any abscess
or intervenable process. CT head also confirmed lack of abcess.
She was started on clinda and xferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Here she also reports headache, flu like symptoms. In the ED she
received a dose of cefepime and she was admitted to OMED.

ROS: Pt notes that jaw pain and fevers started yesterday, but
she has had a few days of dry cough, achyness and fatigue. Today
has some mild abd discomfor which she attributes to not eating.
Denies back pain, dysuria, N/V, diarrhea, chest pain, or SOB.
Denies sick contacts. She does report increase [**Location (un) **] over the last
few weeks.

Past Medical History:
-CLL: Dx in [**12-16**] by periph blood flow cytometry. CT scan showed
abdominal & cervical LAD, and large right pelvic mass.
Excisional biopsy of left supraclavicular node pathology and
immunohistochemistry c/w CLL. BM Bx [**12-16**] revealed extensive
infiltration, with 40% marrow cellularity. Pt was asympt &
deferred Tx until F/sweats in [**1-17**] & Tx was started
w/fludarabine ([**2164-1-24**]). Rituxan was added to 2nd cycle.
However her chemotherapy course was complicated by febrile
neutropenia. After two cycles of fludarabine this was changed to
single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Rituxan, and she completed four weeks of
consolidation. Her post-chemotherapy course was complicated by
febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia. Her bone marrow was again
assessed in [**8-/2162**] and was consistent with treated CLL. She
remained thrombocytopenic following this without a response to
steroids and only minimal response to IVIG. Rituxan weekly was
given from [**2164-10-10**] through [**2164-11-2**] and platelets recovered
to about 30,000. Bone marrow biopsy on [**10/2164**] suggested a
sustained response to chemotherapy on the megakaryocytes. She
began maintenance Rituxan on [**4-/2165**], but her course was
complicated by diffuse arthralgias. Due to increasing painful
lymphadenopathy and IVC compression seen on CT, she was treated
with chlorambucil from [**2166-2-24**] through [**2166-4-3**]. This was
then stopped due to thrombocytopenia. Chlorambucil was restarted
at 4mg dose on [**2166-8-29**] when she progressed with painful
adenopathy. This was given concurrently with prednisone to treat
ITP. The chlorambucil was discontinued on [**2166-10-2**]. A second
course was again started on [**2166-11-20**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Marked decrease in the size of the lymphadenopathy in the
cervical and supraclavicular regions diffusely.

[**2167-1-21**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2163-12-22**], biventricular systolic function remains preserved.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
