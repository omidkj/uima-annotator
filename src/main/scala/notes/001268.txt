CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**2138-12-7**] 8:31 AM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: bleed, fractures
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old woman with s/p MVC
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
bleed, fractures
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post MVC. Evaluate for hemorrhage or
fracture.

No prior studies are available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen,
and pelvis were obtained following the administration 130 cc
Optiray contrast IV. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
obtained.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a large left-sided
pneumothorax, with near complete collapse of the left lung.
There is no pneumothorax on the right. At the right base, there
is patchy parenchymal opacity, which may represent atelectasis.
No aortic injury is identified. There is no pericardial
effusion. The airways are patent to the level of the segmental
bronchi bilaterally.

CT OF ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Lacerated liver parenchyma measures
6.8 x 5.3 cm in greatest axial dimensions. There is also a
laceration of the spleen, greatest at its superior aspect. There
is a small amount of fluid surrounding the spleen. The
gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal. The
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally. The stomach,
small and large bowel are unremarkable. The aorta is of normal
caliber, and the proximal celiac, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The bladder contains contrast
and a foley catheter, and it is compressed at its left lateral
aspect, by a fluid collection. The collection measures 7.3 x 3.7
cm in greatest axial dimension and does contain air. It is of
uncertain etiology. Further characterization with CT cystogram
would be helpful. The uterus, rectum, and sigmoid are
unremarkable. There is a small amount of free pelvic fluid.
There are no pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph
nodes.

BONE WINDOWS: There is a left clavicular fracture. The left
fourth through tenth ribs are fractured. There is fracture of
the right SI joint, with the fracture continuing through the
right ilium. There is a communicated fracture of the right
superior pubic ramus. There is an incomplete fracture of the
right inferior pubic ramus.

Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the
anatomy and pathology in this case (grade 3).

IMPRESSION:
1. Large right posterior liver laceration and splenic
laceration. No active extravasation is identified.
2. Large fluid collection anterior and to the left of the
bladder, compressing the bladder. The fluid collection is of
undermined etiology. It contains air. Further evaluation with CT
cystogram would be helpful.
3. Large left pneumothorax.
4. Fracture of the left clavicle, seven left posterolateral
ribs, the right SI joint, right ilium, right superior and right
inferior pubic rami.

PELVIS (AP, INLET & OUTLET)  [**2138-12-8**] 4:56 PM

PELVIS (AP, INLET & OUTLET)

Reason: ? fracture

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old woman with s/p MVA w/pelvic fx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? fracture
HISTORY: MVA, pelvic fracture.

PELVIS, THREE VIEWS: There fractures of the right inferior and
superior pubic rami, and widening of the right SI joint.

PELVIS (AP, INLET & OUTLET)  [**2138-12-11**] 9:32 AM

PELVIS (AP, INLET & OUTLET)

Reason: Assess for any changes after mobilization

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
22 year old woman with s/p MVA w/pelvic fx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess for any changes after mobilization
INDICATION: Status post MVA with pelvic fractures. Assess for
changes after mobilization.

FOUR VIEWS OF THE PELVIS: There has been no significant change
from the study dated [**2138-12-8**].

Again seen is a fracture of the right superior pubic ramus. The
right inferior pubic ramus fracture seen on the CT from [**12-7**], [**2138**] is not well appreciated. The degree of diastasis of the
right sacroiliac joint is not significantly changed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2138-12-7**]. Patient was evaluated by
the trauma service upon admission. Patient was initially
admitted to the trauma service for observation and evaluation of
pneumothorax and pelvic fractures. Chest tube was placed in the
emergency department. Patient was also found to have a Liver
Laceration and Splenic Laceration. Pelvic fractures were
evaluated by orthopedic service. Upon reviewing films, it had
been decided that the pelvic fractures would be treated
non-operatively. Patient was made weight bearing as tolerated
Left side and touch down weight bearing on the right side.
Clavicle films were reviewed and was also treated
non-operatively. Chest tube was pulled on [**2138-12-10**] without
complications, repeat chest x-ray was negative. Patient
continued to progress throughout course. Pain remained
controlled. Patient remained afebrile/vital signs stable.
Patient was discharged in stable condition to rehab.
