right flank pain

2. Right thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy.
3. Mediastinal lymph node dissection.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old woman with a history of emphysema
and a new right lung mass seen on chest CT from OSH. Ms. [**Known lastname **]
was seen in Thoracic Surgery clinic [**2126-10-17**] for an initial
evaluation of this mass. She returns today following repeat
chest
CT which showed slight enlargement of the spiculated right upper
lobe, FDG avid mass.

Since last being seen, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 44646**] continued R flank and
iliac pain, for which she continues to be treated with low dose
percocet. She underwent an MRI at an OSH for this pain and was
notable for possible disc herniation as well as possible "spine
cancer" per patient. Aside from this, Ms. [**Known lastname **] says she feels
"a little tired" but otherwise has no complaints, with no SOB,
cough or increased sputum production.

[**2127-1-6**]
Chest CT :
1. Mild interval enlargement of a now 2.1 x 1.6 cm spiculated
right upper
lobe pulmonary nodule with associated adjacent pleural
thickening, presumed malignant.
2. Severe upper lobe predominant pulmonary emphysema.
3. Stable, top normal right hilar, right lower paratracheal and
prevascular lymph nodes.
4. Fusiform dilation of the ascending aorta and moderate aortic
valve
calcification of unknown hemodynamic significance.

[**2127-1-9**] CTA Chest :
1. No pulmonary embolism is main pulmonary artery. Due to
suboptimal
opacification of lobar, segmental and subsegmental branches of
pulmonary
artery, assessment of emboli within these branches was limited.

2. There is no evidence of middle lobe torsion, however, it is
remarkable for complete collapse secondary to the occlusion of
middle lobe bronchus, likely from secretions.
3. Multifocal aspiration in left lung.
4. Complete occlusion of the right bronchus intermedius, likely
from
secrections with partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
5. Moderate, nonhemorrhagic, posterior right pleural effusion
with
compressive atelectasis of the adjacent lung, mild right
pneumothorax and
subcutaneous emphysema are likely following recent surgery.
6. Pulmonary artery hypertension.
7. Sever aortic valve calcification, unknown hemodynamic
significance.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent a right thoracoscopy and
right thoracotomy with wedge resection of the right upper lobe.
See formal Op note for details.  She tolerated the procedure
well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.  She had an
epidural catheter placed for pain control which was minimally
effective.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she was able to use her
incentive spirometer and her pain was controlled with a
Bupivacaine epidural and a Dilaudid PCA.  Unfortunately her
epidural fell out and her pain medication was changed to
Oxycodone.

Late in the evening of post op day #1 she suddenly desaturated
to the mid 80's and had a pO2 of 54 on 5L NC.  She was placed on
a 100% non rebreather and her saturations came up to 90%.  Her
chest xray showed a new LL lobe opacity and she subsequently had
a Chest CTA done which ruled out PE but demonstrated RML
collapse due to an occluded right [**Hospital1 **].  Following transfer to the
SICU she underwent a diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy.
She had thick mucous plugging which was aspirated and she
immediately improved.  She remained in the ICU for a few
additional days for vigorous pulmonary toilet including
nebulizers, mucolytics, chest PT and incentive spirometry.  She
was also placed on a 7 day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn.  No
sputum cultures were obtained.  She continued to improve daily.
She remained afebrile with a normal WBC (12K prior to starting
ABX).  Her chest tube was removed after the serosanguinous
drainage tapered off and her thoracotomy incision was healing.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to
require oxygen and would desaturate off of it with exertion.
The Physical Therapy service evaluated her and recommended rehab
for pulmonary toilet.  Hopefully in time her oxygen will be able
to be weaned off prior to returning home. Although she is small
and slight in stature she is able to tolerate a fair amount of
narcotics and still has some discomfort but she also took
Percocet prior to admission for multiple arthritic aches and
pains.  She takes prn Lorazapam at home and has continued on
that but this morning Valium 5 mg was given additionally and was
effective.  Replacing the Lorazapam with Valium may be an option
of needed. She was eating well and ambulating frequently.  Her
antibiotics will end on [**2127-1-16**].  After a prolonged hospital
course she was discharg
