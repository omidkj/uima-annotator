History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1356**] is an 80 year old woman with history of CAD s/p CABG,
CHF (EF 25-30% with BiV ICD placement), NIDDM, hypertension,
TIA, and chronic renal insufficiency who presented on [**2119-5-9**] to
an outside hospital with chest pain, shortness of breath, fever,
fatigue, hypotension, and nausea. Upon evaluation, she was found
to be febrile to 102, lethargic and unable to provide meaningful
history. Her troponin was elevated at 2.7 and creatinine was
elevated to 2.4 (baseline 1.0), BNP of 897. Her chest x-ray
showed mild pulmonary edema.
.
On admission, blood and urine cultures were performed. She was
initially started on Unasyn given concern over a UTI (given
indwelling suprapubic catheter). She was started on oxacillin
and vancomycin when blood cultures grew back Staph aureus in [**3-10**]
bottles (resistant to penicillin and cefazolin). An
echocardiogram (TTE) on [**2119-5-11**] showed a vegetation on the mitral
valve and severe mitral regurgitation, thought to be new. A TEE
was not performed. Of note, urine culture grew E. coli 10-50,000
CFU, pan-sensitive.
.
Over the course of the OSH admission on [**5-11**], she became
hypotensive (systolic in the low 100's) with low urine output; a
right IJ central line was placed for administration of
dobutamine. Per report, CVP was 7. At the time of transfer, the
dobutamine was running at 5mcg, and urine output was
100-200cc/hr.
.
The site of the right IJ central line has been oozing since it
was placed (at the time, INR was elevated to 3.3). Her
hematocrit was 32 on admission and dropped to 27 and then 24;
she was planned to get two units of pRBC's but was a difficult
crossmatch due to antibodies.
.
On review of symptoms, she reports mild sore throat and chest
painshe denies any prior history of TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Physical Exam:
VS: T 98.5F, BP 125/52, HR 81, RR 14, O2 99% on room air
Gen: WDWN elderly female in NAD, resp or otherwise. Oriented x
2. Mood, affect appropriate. Pleasant.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple; unable to assess JVP on right side given right IJ.

CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR, normal S1, S2. I/VI systolic murmur heard at apex.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. Bibasilar crackles,
otherwise clear.
Abd: Obese, soft, non-tender, mildly distended. Normal active
bowel sounds. No HSM or tenderness. No abdominal bruits.
Suprapubic catheter in place; dressing clean/dry/intact.
Ext: No clubbing or cyanosis. Trace edema in lower extremities
bilaterally. No femoral bruits. 1+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas. No
stigmata of endocarditis.


Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. A mass measuring 0.6cm in greatest width is adherent to
the RV pacing lead is seen within the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. LV systolic function appears
depressed. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch
and descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a moderate-sized vegetation (09.x0.8 cm) on
the atrial surface of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve.
It is slightly mobile and irregular in its appearance,
consistent with a vegetation or possibly a torn chordae with
mild calcification. No mitral valve abscess is seen. Mild to
moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due
to suboptimal image quality. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Small mobile echodensity on the posterior leaflet of
the mitral valve consistent with a vegetation. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation. Small mass adherent to the RV pacing lead
seen with the body of the right atrium, suggestive of a fibrin
strand.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2119-5-14**] 10:06 AM

PORTABLE ABDOMEN

Reason: please assess for any evidence of obstruction

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old woman with nausea, vomiting, endocarditis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please assess for any evidence of obstruction
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Nausea and vomiting in a patient with
endocarditis.

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies
available for comparison.

The overall appearance of the abdomen is unremarkable with
preserved bowel gas and contents. No dilated bowel loops were
demonstrated. Note is made of a prior left hip replacement.

Right hip pain. Sepsis.

FINDINGS: No old films available for comparison. The patient is
status post left total hip replacement with the prosthesis in
good location. There are severe degenerative changes of the
right hip with joint space narrowing, sclerosis, subchondral
cysts and osteophytes. The margins of the entire humeral head
cannot be adequately defined inferiorly and it is unclear if
this is due to osteopenia or overlying osteophytes. Infection
cannot be totally excluded and if this remains a clinical
concern, recommend followup with MRI.

Renal U/S:
FINDINGS: Grayscale evaluation of bilateral kidneys reveals no
evidence of stones, or hydronephrosis. There is a simple cyst
within the mid pole of the left kidney, measuring approximately
1.9 cm.

There is a suprapubic catheter seen coursing into the bladder.
Mild anechoic region surrounding of course of the superior
catheter likely reflects a small amount of fluid or edema. There
is no evidence for a discrete abscess. Initial images which
demonstrate a rounded heterogeneous appearance approximately 1.6
cm adjacent to the region of the bladder was not reproducible
upon re-examination, and may have reflected either a portion of
the bladder or bowel.

IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of an abscess.
2. No evidence of hydronephrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Mitral valve vegetation:
Patient meets criteria for bacterial endocarditis per OSH echo
and will require 6 weeks of antibiotics. She has remained
afebrile. Portal of entry thought to be suprapubic catheter
(also urine growing E. coli), but exact source unclear. She also
has history of sacral decubitous ulcer. TTE done here at [**Hospital1 18**]
which does demonstrate MV mass on posterior leaflet that appears
ehcogenic; TEE with small mobile echodensity on posterior
leaflet consistent wi
