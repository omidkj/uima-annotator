History of Present Illness:

filter, DM, asthma, and OSA who presents with 2 days of dark
stools and lightheadedness. The patient reports that she has had
dark, non-bloody stools for two days associated with lower
quadrant cramping. She also reports lightheadeness on standing

have lower abd discomfort, guiac positive brown stool w/o any
overt melena. Her HCT was found to be down 27 from 31 at the end
of [**Month (only) 359**], but up from 25 during presumed GIB in [**2185-8-20**].
NG lavage was negative. She received FFP 2 units, vit K 10mg IV,
protonix 80mg IV and IVF. She had a type and screen sent. CT abd
was performed for abdominal pain which showed no acute process.

Pertinent Results:
Radiologic Data:
Capsule Endoscopy: [**8-/2185**]
1. Coffee grounds in the stomach
2. delay in gastric emptying
3.Angioectasia in the proximal jejunum

.
EGD's:
11 EGD's since [**2179**], some with agioectasias,last EGD [**2185-9-1**]
Erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis
A small bowel enteroscope was passed to what appeared to be the
mid jejunum. No AVMs or other abnormalities were seen.
Otherwise normal EGD to middle jejunum
.
Colonoscopies: 5 coloscopies since [**2179**], last [**4-/2185**]
Polyp in the proximal ascending colon (polypectomy)
Internal hemorrhoids
Angioectasia in the descending colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
.
Small bowel enteroscopy: [**4-/2185**]
Angioectasia in the upper third of the stomach
Angioectasia in the proximal to mid jejunum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
CT abd/pelvis: prelim
no acute intra-abdominal process to explain pain
.
[**12-6**] MRA BRAIN:
IMPRESSION: Marked degradation of image quality by patient
motion. There is no definite evidence of a high flow [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
malformation, although given both patient motion and the extent
of the imaging excursion, a CTA of the head would be far more
sensitive for evaluation and would be less prone to motion
artifact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11468**] is a 54 year old female with a history of multiple
upper GI bleeds from arteriovenous malformations who was
admitted to the ICU for several episodes of melena and decreased
HCT.
.
1. ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA/GI BLEED- patient has a history of
multiple upper GI bleeds due to AVMs. There is concern for
hereditary telangectasia disorders such as Osler-[**Doctor Last Name 11586**]-Rendu.
She was hemodynamically stable on arrival to the ICU, after
receiving one unit of FFP and 10mg Vitamin K in the Emergency
department to reverse her therepeutic INR.  In the ICU, she was
transfused 2units of packed RBCs for a hematocrit of 23.1, with
an appropriate increase in her hematocrit to 29.5. Thereafter,
the patient's hematocrit remained stable. The patient was called
out to the medical floor on [**2185-12-3**].  She underwent MRA of the
brain, which although markedly limited by motion, showed no
obvious intracranial AVM.  Her Hct remained stable on the floor
and she was instructed to follow-up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-8**].
