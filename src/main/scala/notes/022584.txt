CTA chest and Abd:
1) No evidence of PE.
2) Diffuse lung changes consistent with emphysema and congestive
heart failure.
3) Moderate bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis, and a
component of consolidation, aspiration, or pneumonia cannot be
ruled out.
4) Bulk lymphadenopathy mainly of the mediastinum and hila.
5) Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, of uncertain
significance. There is no good contrast enhancement of the
abdomen and pelvis, which were done as an addition after PE
study, and if clinically warranted, further evaluation can be
done by multiphasic CT

Cardiac Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed no evidence of flow-limiting coronary disease.  The
LMCA was
free of flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD had mild luminal
irregularities.  The previously placed stent in the D1 branch
was widely
patent.  The LCX had mild luminal irregularities.  The ostial
RCA had a
40% lesion.  The previously placed stents in the PDA were
patent.
2.  Hemodynamic evaluation on entry revealed mildly elevated
right-sided
pressures (mean RA was 10 and RVEDP was 14 mmHg), mildly
elevated
left-sided pressures (mean PCW was 17 mmHg and LVEDP was 19
mmHg), and
severely elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 70/29/49 mmHg).
The
central aortic pressure was 105/55/71 mmHg.  The cardiac index
was
normal at 3.7 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
The
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was elevated at 305
dynes-sec/cm5.
There was a 5 mmHg gradient across the aortic valve on pullback
of the
angled pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending
aorta.
3.  Hemodynamic evaluation after 15 minutes of 100% inhaled
oxygen
revealed severely elevated pulmonary pressures of 71/30/50 mmHg.
 The
mean PCW was 15 mmHg.  The cardiac index was normal at 3.8
L/min/m2
(using an assumed oxygen consumption).  The PVR was elevated at
326
dynes-sec/cm5.
4.  Hemodynamic evaluation after 15 minutes of inhaled nitric
oxide
revealed severely elevated pulmonary pressures of 65/29/42 mmHg.
 The
mean PCW was 16 mmHg.  The cardiac index was normal at 3.6
L/min/m2
(using an assumed oxygen consumption).  The PVR was elevated at
248
dynes-sec/cm5.

CXR: Slightly increased CHF. Right-sided PICC with its tip in
the mid SVC.

TTE: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
6. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2105-4-24**],
there has been no
significant change.

Hi Res CT:
1. CHF with bilateral atelectasis and small bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
3. Mild emphysema.
4. Multiple focal calcified granulomas within both lungs.
Appearances are most consistent with chronic changes due to
prior histoplasmosis or varicella pneumonia.
5. We cannot define or clearly evaluate for diffuse lung disease
in the presence of these acute abnormalities.

PMIBI: Partially reversible, moderate defect in tracer uptake
involving the
apex, inferior wall and inferiolateral wall.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hypoxia- The patient was admitted on 4LNC. During the first week
of his hospital course, he became profoundly hypoxic requiring
100% NRB and 8L NC. Etiology is likely multifactorial in origin
from pulmonary HTN, possible DIP, and noncardiogenic edema. He
is usually on 3L NC at home at baseline with sats 88-90%. He had
several episodes of desaturations into the 60s on floor improved
with ativan, morphine, and lasix. Pulmonary service was
consulted. CT chest showed pulmonary edema and effusions, LENIS
negative for DVT, and TTE with bubble negative for shunt. CTA
was negative for PE. Increased flolan from 58 to 60. Coumadin
was not started given anticoagulant effects of flolan and
plavix. Attempt of aggressive diuresis did not improve
saturations. After his catheterization, his baseline sats were
lower in the 80s. He was tranferred to the MICU overnight for
closer monitoring. He felt improved the next morning and
transferred back to the floor. Restarted Prednisone 100 mg po QD
and Bactrim PPX on [**2105-5-9**]. PPD negative. The patient's
oxygenation improved and his oxygen was weaned to 4LNC. His
saturations were 94% at rest and then decreased to low 80s with
ambulation. He was able to walk 30-40 yards before feeling very
short of breath, better than his baseline. Lung biopsy slides
from [**2103-5-25**] were obtained from [**Hospital1 2177**] and are under review here
currently. He will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to wean steroids.

CARDIAC - On admit, patient noted increased NTG use for atypical
chest pressure. He ruled out for MI by enzymes with unchanged
EKG. Obtained stress MIBI which showed moderate reversible
inferior defect. Continued ASA, BB, statin, plavix. BNP 600s.
Cath without sig CAD [**5-5**], no interventions performed.

Possible diastolic CHF - Increased pulmonary edema by CXR and CT
scan. Repeat TTE in house w/ preserved systolic function, but
increased pulm HTN. Increased lasix to 120 mg IV BID as well as
added zaroxylyn. Cath [**5-6**] without evidence of diastolic or
systolic failure. Wedge was 15. Cardiolgy was consulted and
after review of cath and TTE, thought that there was no evidence
for heart failure. Decreased Lasix from 160 po QD to 80 po QD
