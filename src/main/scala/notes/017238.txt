Radiology:
CT head [**1-15**]
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, mass
effect, edema, or major vascular territorial infarct. There is
no shift of
normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is
preserved. Ventricles and sulci appear prominent, likely age
related change.
Pronounced hypoattenuating area in the left frontal subcortical
white matter as well as other regions of hypoattenuation in
bilateral subcortical and periventricular distribution are
compatible with small vessel ischemic disease. Atherosclerotic
calcifications involving cavenous portions of the carotid
arteries are unchanged. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are clear. No osseous abnormality is noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.
2. Unchanged age-related involutional change and small vessel
ischemic
disease.

TTE [**1-11**]
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. No mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No echocardiographic
evidence of endocarditis but technically limited study.
Borderline normal left ventricular systolic function. Resting
tachycardia.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-1-5**],
the heart rate is faster. Left ventricular function appears more
vigorous and the cavity size is smaller. Estimated pulmonary
artery pressures are lower.

[**1-2**] TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Normal left ventricular cavity size with preserved
regional/global systolic function.
In the setting of a tachycardia, these findings are suggestive
of a primary pulmonary process, e.g., pulmonary embolism.
Clinical correlation suggested.

[**1-5**] TTE
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
distal [**12-26**] of the left ventricle. The basal segments contract
normally (LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve
sten
