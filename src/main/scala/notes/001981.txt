Brief Hospital Course:
Following transfer he ruled in with positive troponins. He had
continued angina and underwent catheterization to revealed
triple vessel diseae.  He went the following morning for urgent
revascularization. See operative note for details. He weaned
from bypass on Neo Synephrine and Propofol.  He weaned from the
ventilator and was extubated on POD 1. Beta blockade was started
and he was diuresed towards his preoperative weight.  Diuresis
was increased due to persistent left effusion which was present
pre-operatively. His foley was removed and he was able to void
in small amounts with an 850cc residual- foley was replaced and
will need a repeat voiding trial. Physical Therapy worked with
him for strength and mobility. Chest tubes and temporary pacing
wires were removed according to protocol.  He was placed on
antibiotics for sternal drainage. He was discharged to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**]
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 731**] for futher recovery prior to returning home.
