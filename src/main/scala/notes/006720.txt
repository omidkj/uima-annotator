Imaging:
CXR [**2171-6-25**]: Streaky airspace opacities within the lung bases,
slightly worse in the left lung base when compared to the prior
study.  These could reflect areas of bibasilar atelectasis but
infection particularly in the left lung base cannot be excluded.
 Emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo M w/ PMH of COPD (no PFTs in our system) and alcohol
intoxication presented intoxicated complaining of shortness of
breath and admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and
concern for pneumonia vs. COPD exacerbation.

#Hypoxia- patient has baseline COPD and it is unclear if he
takes his medications as an outpatient. he complained of some
shortness of breath on admission and was sating 89% on RA in no
respiratory distress. He received multiple rounds of nebulizers
with improvement in airmovement in his lungs.  His VBG on 3L of
NC was unremarkable.  He was admitted to the ICU for monitoring
of his respiratory status while he had altered mental status.
As his mental status improved, his respiratory status remained
stable with O2 sat 92 on Room Air, which appears to be his
baseline.

#Altered mental status- patient was intoxicated on admission
with a blood alcohol level of 332. The morning after admission
he was A+Ox3 with a nonfocal neurological exam.  Initially there
was concern that he may have had hypercarbia causing his AMS,
however as his EtOH intoxication decreased, his mental status
improved.

#Alcohol dependence-Patient has had many admissions/ED visits
for alcohol intoxication. He has no history of withdrawal
seizures but has had problems with respiratory depression in the
setting of preventing his withdrawal with diazepam.  On this
admission because of his inability to take in po, he was started
on IV ativan. over the first night he recieved 2 mg IV ativan
for agitation. Social work was consulted while he was here given
his frequent admissions for this. As he was able to take PO in
the morning, he was given a total of 15mg of Diazepam for CIWA
>10. Discharge to a detox facility was discussed, however Mr.
[**Known lastname 7710**] stated he did not want to quit drinking and would go back
to drinking after going to rehab.  Decision was made not to send
him to rehab and to discharge directly from ICU.

#Hypertension- patient has a history of hypertension however on
admission his BPs ranged in the low 100s.  He was unable to
verify his home regimen and his antihypertensives were held.
While in the MICU, his SBP ranged from 100-140s.  No anti
hypertensives were started.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-Pt. was counseled on alcohol cessation, he should continue to
be encouraged to quit drinking.
-Pt. should be further counseled to take his COPD medications
-Pt. would benefit from social work assistance
