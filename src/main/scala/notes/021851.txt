REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p ct d/c
AP CHEST 10:35 A.M., [**2-15**]

HISTORY: Coronary artery disease and mitral valve repair.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-13**] and preoperative
radiographs on [**1-30**]:

Postoperative caliber of the cardiomediastinal silhouette has
increased only minimally since [**2-13**], a common finding
following tracheal extubation. Borderline interstitial edema and
new right lower lobe atelectasis are other expected findings.
Tip of the Swan-Ganz line projects over the proximal right
pulmonary artery. Midline and left pleural drains have been
removed. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right
jugular line tip projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)

Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity.
Moderate global LV hypokinesis.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -
hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex -
hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. There is mild global right ventricular
free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve
leaflets. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.

Post-CPB (on epinephrine 0.02 mcg/kg/min, phenylephrine 0.5
mcg/kg/min)
The mitral repair shows no evidence of any regurgitation. There
is minimal
gradient across the mitral valve (4 mmHg). There is no evidence
of LVOT
obstruction. Overall LV systolic function improved with
background inotropic
support.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt. was admitted on [**2170-2-13**] and underwent CABGx2(SVG->Diag
and RCA)/MV repair(27mm ring).  The cross clamp time was 75 mins
and total bypass time was 93 mins.  She tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CSRU on Epi, Neo, and Propofol.
She was changed from Epi to Milrinone on the post op night and
was extubated on POD#1.  She slowly progressed and was
transferred to the floor on POD#3.  She continued to progress
and was discharged to home on POD#5 in stable condition.
