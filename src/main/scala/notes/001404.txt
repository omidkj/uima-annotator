Shortness of Breath

History of Present Illness:
58-year-old man with HIV, pulmonary hypertension, hepatitis C
cirrhosis, OSA, DM, CHF with a few weeks of SOB.  Patient was a
poor historian who seems to describe the gradual onset of
increasing DOE over the past 2-3 weeks.  Per recent pulmonology
and cardiology notes this shortness of breath has been getting
gradually worse.  He also noted a 30 lbs weight gain that he
reported over the last few weeks (from 330 to 360).  Patient
reported that he felt like he couldn't breathe. He reported that
he had worsening leg edema, ascites. Complained of exertional
chest tightness, no pain. No recent fevers, no abdominal pain.
He described diarrhea x 2 days and some chills prior to
presentation.  He had occasional palpitations.  He described
chest pain that started on the right side of his chest one day
prior to admission.  It was pleuritic in nature and ranges from
[**2184-3-15**].

In the ED, vitals were 97.8 89 123/64 24 96 on RA.  He was given
an ASA.  Pressure dropped to 80s, then responded to 90s after
given some fluids (500cc NS).  Held lasix (takes 160 per day?).
CXR with ? some effusions.  K elevated to 6.9 and received 1 amp
Ca gluconate, kayexelate and given 325 of ASA.  No ECG changes.
On transfer to floor, 98/55, 84, 14 100% on CPAP 10/5.  He was
placed on CPAP given his respiratory distress.

Past Medical History:
- HIV (last CD4 count 588 on [**2184-1-17**])
- Hepatitis C with stage IV cirrhosis, s/p antiviral tx
- Chronic kidney disease requiring several hospitalizations and

short-term dialysis
- Hypercholesterolemia
- Obstructive sleep apnea
- Depression
- CHF (last LVEF [**1-/2184**] >= 55%)
- GERD
- Obesity
- h/o C diff colitis ([**3-14**])
- Pancreatitis
- s/p Cholecystectomy
- s/p Appendectomy

Social History:
Patient lives with a female companion on [**Location (un) **]. He lost most
of his possessions, including property, when his bank when under
and recalled his loans which he could not pay and foreclosed his
home and other properties.  This precipitated his psychiatric
admission for depression in [**Month (only) 116**]. Denies tobacco, alcohol or
current IV drug use. Has h/o IVDU.

Family History:
Depression and anxiety. Father with DM, CAD; Mother with CAD.
Brother was MI at age 46.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 98/55, 84, 14 100% on CPAP 10/
General: Alert, oriented, mild respiratory distress. CPAP on.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: Dificlt to assess JVP given neck girth
Lungs: Decreased BS b/l, Rhales at the bases b/l
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: Obese soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds
present, no rebound tenderness or guarding.
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, Pitting edema +1 b/l.


Pertinent Results:
[**1-17**] CXR: Opacity at the left base suggestive of pneumonia.

[**1-19**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position and right ventricular pressure
overload. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old male with a history of long-standing HIV on HAART,
pulmonary hypertension, HCV (s/p successful interferon), stage
IV cirrhosis, dCHF, morbid obesity, DM, OSA, renal insufficiency
and previous hyperkalemia, who presented to the ED with weight
gain, chills, dyspnea and increasing edema, ARF. On the day of
admission he endorsed headache and myalgia.

Overall, major contributors to his presenting condition were
weight gain secondary to both increased ascites (cardiogenic and
hepatic), pulmonary hypertension and renal failure. BNP and
signs of volume overload were not marked, and venous pressure
was slightly up. Therefore there was likely some increased
interstitial fluid/intravascular fluid, with a possible large
contribution from ascites. This would have accounted for weight
gain and some increased difficulty walking before the admission.
Pulmonary hypertension and resulting fixed cardiac output with
slight fluid overload are likely contributors to dyspnea. We
need to also be mindful of HIV as a cause of pulmonary
hypertension and also for atypical infections, though CD4 counts
were reassuring.

# Dyspnea:
Likely multifactorial as mentioned. Pneumonia seemed less likely
given no constitutional signs of infection. Pulmonary
hypertension, slight fluid overload were most likely, while we
were mindful of unlikely pulmonary embolism (given rapid
recovery and likely little reserve given his underlying
physiology). Flu swab was negative and there was little concern
for CAP.  Patient was diuresed while he was in the MICU wit
