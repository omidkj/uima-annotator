Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with afib & bradycardia s/p PPM placement initially admitted
to the ICU with sepsis, with concerns for cellulitis and
pneumonia as bacterial infections.  He was treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics, aggressive fluid hydration and responded
well.  He did not require intubation, nor did he have a large
oxygen requirement. He also did not require pressors.  His
physical exam was notable for RLE cellulitis and CXR notable for
possible retrocardiac opacity.  He was monitored overnight and
sent to the floor in stable conditions. He remained on Vanc/CTX
while his culture grew out, and eventually transitioned to PO
ampicillin when his blood grew out Group B Strept.  He will
continue this medication for a total of 14 days of treatment.
His course was complicated by likely demand ischemia (NSTEMI) in
the setting of sepsis.  He was treated conservatively with BB,
ASA, high dose statin and his ECHO 48 hrs after the event
revealed no change.  His Coumadin was also increased from 8.5 to
10 mg as he had a subtherapeutic INR and he was therapeutic on
time of discharge.  This will need following.  His Foley was
removed and restarted back on his Terazosin and Oxybutynin.
.

in agreement that Mr. [**Known firstname 106389**] [**Known lastname 106390**] was a suitable candidate
