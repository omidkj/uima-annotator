.
EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Ventricular premature beats. Left atrial
abnormality. Low limb lead QRS voltage is non-specific. Modest
non-specific low amplitude lateral T wave changes. Since the
previous tracing of [**2135-12-20**] limb lead QRS voltage is lower
making assessment for possible prior inferior wall myocardial
infarction more difficult, and lateral T wave amplitude is
lower.
.
CXR:
Large left effusion, obscuring the left mid and lower lung.
.
LEFT FOOT FILM:
No fracture of the left foot is identified. There are
degenerative changes at the tarsometatarsal joints. There is a
pes cavus. Clips are noted within the medial left ankle soft
tissues. Otherwise, soft tissues are unremarkable, and no ulcers
are visualized. There is no osseous destruction visualized to
confirm osteomyelitis.
.
CT CHEST:
There is a large layering left pleural effusion causing eversion
of the left hemidiaphragm and extending into the azygoesophageal
recess. There is atelectasis of the left lower lobe and lingula.
A 2.6 x 2 cm lobulated, pleural-based solid mass is seen in the
left upper lobe abutting the mediastinal pleura, however,
without any invasion of the mediastinal pleura or the lateral
chest wall.
A 4-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule is seen in the right lower
lobe (image 2:36). The airways are patent up to the subsegmental
bronchi. There is an enlarged 11-mm subcarinal lymph node. There
is no hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial effusion.
The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.
.
ABI/PVR:
Findings consistent with significant aortobi-iliac level
arterial disease. In addition, there is most likely significant
tibial level arterial disease bilaterally.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to
severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CAROTID DOPPLER:
Findings as stated above which indicate 60-69% ICA stenoses
bilaterally


Brief Hospital Course:
  Shortly after admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed respiratory
distress in the setting of aspiration and a large pleural
effusion, requiring intubation and transfer to ICU. While in the
ICU his pleural effusion was drained and found to have malignant
cells.  Recently the medical team had discovered a lung mass by
imaging studies and this was felt to be the likely primary.
After drainage of the effusion and placement of a pleuridex
catheter pt was able to be extubated.  Shortly after extubation
pt required re-intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
At that time the patient was found to have a re-accumulation of
the pleural fluid as well as pulmonary edema.
  Pt was initially admitted for severe peripheral vascular
disease and resultant necrosis of the distal toes.  The legs
were mottled, with markedly diminished pulses, and amputation
was advised but refused by the patient.  Antibiotics were
administered in an attemt to cover likely infection given the
increasinglt gangrenous appearance of his feet.
  On [**2139-12-6**] while pt was intubated, sedation was lightened and
family was able talk to him about his wishes.  After a family
meeting with the ICU team, family requested extubation, fully
understanding that he would likely not survive long of of the
ventilator.  Pt was extubated and died shortly therafter.
