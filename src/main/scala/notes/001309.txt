Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Scopolamine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1162**]
Chief Complaint:
Right Foot Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is an 85yo F with a PMH significant for CAD, HTN,
hyperlipidemia s/p MI and CVA with residual right-sided weakness
who presents with right heel pain. Patient states that the pain
began 2 nights ago and awoke her from her sleep. She states that
she has had pain in that foot before but nothing like this. She
states that the pain bothered her at rest but was worse with
weight bearing. She states that it is a sharp pain. She denies
any trauma to the foot. She states that the foot is not sore to
the touch. She is not able to wiggle her toes at baseline [**1-29**]
CVA, however, she reports that he sensory funtion is intact. She
states that she has swelling on and off in her LE at baseline.
.
Pt initially presented to her PCP who referred her to the ED for
concern over her what seemed to be cold foot. In the ED, initial
vitals were T: 99.2 BP: 116/68 P: 95 RR: 16 O2: 100% RA. The
patient was evaluated by vascular surgery who did not feel that
this was a vascular issue. US of the RLE was negative for DVT
and x-rays of the foot were unrevealing. An EKG was performed
that showed flattened T waves in V4-6, cardiac enzymes were sent
and the patient was found to have a troponin leak and elevated
CK, .54 and 231 respectively. Patient denied any chest pain or
shortness of breath. While in the ED the patient was hypotensive
to 78/32 and was responsive to a 500cc bolus of NS. Patient
given ASA and started on heparin gtt. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
ROMI.
.
On arrival in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], vitals T: 100.1 BP: 98/57 HR: 101 RR: 18
O2sat: 100% 2L. Patient complains solely of right heel pain.
.
ROS: + runny nose, occasional palpitations, swelling in legs,
occasional numbness and tingling in hands and toes

[**12-7**] CXR IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or
CHF. Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions. No change
from [**2196-1-11**].

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2196-12-7**] 2:38 PM
IMPRESSION: No deep vein thrombosis in the right lower
extremity.

ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the basal and mid-inferolateral segments, and
near-akinesis of the mid-septum and distal LV segments/apex.
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
20-25%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-12-2**],
left ventricle is now dilated. The other findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is an 85yo F with a PMH significant for CAD, HTN,
hyperlipidemia s/p MI and CVA with residual right-sided weakness
who presented with right heel pain.

1.  ROMI/Ischemia/CAD: The patient had a PMH with CAD s/p
inferior MI [**2186**], NSTEMI [**11-29**]; She has known three vessel
disease, with her last study in [**2192**]. She has declined
intervention or CABG ever since. It was felt that Trop and mild
CK elevation could be due to failure rather than ACS however she
also had new pseudonormalization of T waves in leads V4-V5 which
were concerning for ischemia and flipped R waves and loss of R
wave progression on repeat ekg.  Given that the patient refused
further intervention she was medically managed with asa, statin,
beta-blocker and ACE-I.  She remained asymptomatic and denied CP
or SOB throughout the hospitalization once transferred to the
floor.
.
2.CHF acute on chronic systolic failure--the patient had a
repeat echo performed during this admission (see results above).
 Her lasix was transiently held upon leaving the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to
hypotension.  The patient had evidence of fluid overload upon
stopping the diuretics which were slowly added back at a lower
dose due to the patient's lower BP.  This will need to be
titrated back up in the outpatient setting.  The discharge dose
is lasix 40mg po bid.  She did not require any K repletion on
this regimen so this will need to be re-evaluated as an
outpatient as well.

3. HTN: The patient was hypotensive to 80s on admission.  All of
her BP meds were initially held and then titrated back during
her stay.  The patient did not tolerate a high dose of
beta-blocker and was discharged on Toprol XL 25mg po daily.  She
was discharged on the rest of her incoming meds besides lasix at
the previous dose and frequency.
