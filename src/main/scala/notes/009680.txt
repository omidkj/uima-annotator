Pertinent Results:
CT head ([**9-18**])
1. Enlarging bilateral parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion with
surrounding edema, largest in the right temporal lobe. No
midline shift or evidence of
herniation.
2. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the bilateral
temporal,
parietal, and frontal lobes.
3. Small bifrontal subdural hematoma.
4. Longitudinal fracture through the left temporal bone,
extending into the left carotid canal and left middle ear.
Recommend correlation with dedicated temporal bone CT performed
concurrently.

Temporal bone CT ([**9-18**])
1. Extensive longitudinal fracture of the left temporal bone
with extension to the left middle ear cavity, left carotid
canal, clivus, and likely terminating in the posterior
nasopharynx. Correlation with emergent CTA of the head is
recommended to evaluate for left carotid artery injury.
Injury to the facial nerve is also likely and clinical
correlation is
recommended.

2. Non-displaced fracture through the right orbital roof, with
associated
right intraconal air.

3. Fracture involving the left tegmen tympani, with
pneumocephalus in the
left middle cranial fossa. Ossicular dislocation and fracture is
probable.

CT C-spine: ([**9-18**])
1. No evidence of cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
2. Longitudinal left temporal bone fracture. Please refer to
dedicated
temporal bone CT scan for further evaluation.
3. Small left apical pneumothorax. Correlation with CT of the
chest
performed at the outside hospital is recommended.

CT T-spine ([**9-18**])
1. Acute fracture of T4 vertebra involving the anterior inferior
body with
maintenance of spinal alignment.
2. Left-sided rib fractures involving posterior aspect of fifth
through
seventh ribs.
3. Small left apical pneumothorax, with chest tube in place.
4. Bilateral posterior atelectatic changes, left greater than
right.
5. Mild degenerative changes in the spine, with mild anterior
wedging of T12, uncertain chronicity.

CT L-spine ([**9-18**])
1. No acute fracture or subluxation in the lumbar spine.
2. Mild degenerative changes with anterior wedging involving T12
vertebra,
likely chronic.

CTA head and neck ([**9-19**])
1. No aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, dissection flaps, or
occlusions are
identified. However, MR is a more sensitive study for evaluation
of
dissection.
2. Mild stenosis of the distal right common carotid artery and
the right
internal carotid artery.
3. Multiple small filling defects within the left sigmoid sinus
and the left internal jugular vein just below the skull base
which may represent thrombi.
4. Extensive hemorrhagic contusions, subarachnoid hemorrhages,
and subdural hematomas as described above.
5. Fracture through the left temporal bone with pneumocephalus.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo M was pedestrian struck by car at 30 mph, and thrown over
the windshield.  GCS of 3 and intubated at scene.  Taken to
[**Hospital 487**] hospital where CT showed SAH and skull fx, and a left
chest tube was placed with 100-200 mL sanginous output.
Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**], where pt remained unresponsive with GCS
[**4-12**], and head CT showed IPH contusion in bilateral temporal
lobes, SAH in bilateral temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes,
bifrontal SDH, and longitudinal L temporal bone fx with blood in
the external and middle ear canals.

Neuro: Head injuries include: IPH contusion in bilateral
temporal lobes, SAH in bilateral temporal, frontal, and parietal
lobes, bifrontal SDH, and longitudinal L temporal bone fx with
blood in the external and middle ear canals.  CTA was performed
to evaluate for carotid injury, which was not seen.  The patient
was placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and manitol. No
bolt was placed as CT showed no signs of herniation or greatly
increased ICH.  Neuro exams wax and wane, but pt remained
unresponsive with GCS from 4T to 7T.  Right pupil was surgical
and always absent, left pupil reported as either absent, or
delayed.  BUE and LE with decorticate posturing, no movement, or
triple flexion.  No localized response to noxious stimuli.

Resp: Intubated in field, and chest tube placed at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 11560**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with 200 mL of sangunous drainage.  Chest CT showed
multiple left sided rib fractures.  Trach was placed on [**9-21**].

CV: IVC filter attempted on [**9-21**], but no venous access could be
obtained.  Recieved 2 unit transfusion for chronic anemia [**9-28**].
normal blood pressure was maintained with metroprolol

GI: Pt recieved peg [**2162-9-21**] for nutrition.  Had nutrition
consult to optimize tube feeds.  Placed on bowel regimine

ID: [**9-23**] fever and elevated WBC.  Placed on vancomycin and cipro
for emperic VAP. Cipro was changed to Levo and Zosyn on [**9-26**].
