Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2179-6-10**], Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stenting to
LAD

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 62 year old male with history of coronary artery
disease status post NSTEMI with catherization in [**2171**] showing
80% OM1 lesion that was medically managed, hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as transfer from [**Location (un) **]
for STEMI.  He reports that he noted increasing chest pain with
exertion starting several weeks ago during a business trip to
[**State 4565**]. Pain was elicited with walking [**Age over 90 **] yards or so. This
worsened to the point where minimal activity was uncomfortable
and elicited pain. He awoke the morning of admission with chest
pain that did not go away. He denies nausea, diaphoresis, arm
numbness, and in fact attended a golf tournament on the day of
presentation to [**Location (un) **]. He felt terrible with continued chest
pain all day, golfed poorly, and finally presented to [**Location (un) **] at
8pm.

An EKG was performed with ST elevations in AVr, V1, and
depressions in V3-V6. Initial CK 700s with increased MB
fraction.  He was given heparin, aggrestate, nitro gtt. He was
given lopressor 5mg IV x1, 4 x 81mg ASA, morphine and dilaudid.
He was not given plavix due to concern for possible surgical
disease. He was transfered here for further intervention.

Upon arrival to the floor after catherization, he reported some
nausea, but no other symptoms.

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Coronary artery disease with catherization in [**2171**]
- Gout
- Psoriasis
- Status post surgical removal of deposits in feet secondary to
gout


Social History:
Patient is divorced and works as marketing manager for electric
engineering firm. He lives in [**Hospital1 2436**] and works in [**Location (un) **].
His children live on the West Coast. He smoked very little, and
stopped all smoking in [**2141**], having smoked [**1-6**] PPD. He drinks
[**2-7**] glasses of wine per week.
.


Family History:
[**Name (NI) **] father had a myocardial infarction in his mid-50s. His
brother died in early 60s of sudden cardiac death while mowing
lawn.

Physical Exam:
98.1 92 107/77 100%RA 16
GEN: Alert/Oriented, NAD
HEENT: good dentition, no appreciable JVP elevation
CV: RRR s1 s2, no M/G/R
RESP: CTA laterally
ABD: soft, non tender, non distended, no masses
GROIN: left arterial sheath in place, no audible bruits.
EXT: Palpaple pulses bialterally


Pertinent Results:
CXR: AP portable without discrete infiltrates. Straghtening of
left heart border
.
[**2179-6-10**] Cardiac Cath:
 COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant
patient revealed two vessel CAD.  The LMCA had mild luminal
irregularities.  The LAD had diffuse proximal 20% disease
followed by a
99% stenosis at first diagonal involving the diagonal with
thrombus.
The LAD was a large vessel that wrapped around apex.  The apical
LAD had
a 80% distal lesion felt to be embolic.  The LCX had a chronic
occlusion
at the origin of the major OM.  The LCX did not supply much
territory
antegrade but was well collateralized from RCA.  The RCA had
proximal
40% lesion and distal 30-40% lesion.
2.  Limited hemodynamics with BP 106/78 with HR 92 in sinus.
During
procedure patient had several runs of AIVR and NSVT.
3.  Successful stenting of LAD with Vision 3x23mm bare metal
stent after
ballooning the jailed major diagonal with a 2.5mm balloon.
Final
angiography with no complications and patient left the cath lab
in
stable condition.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Anterior STEMI treated with primary angioplasty
3. Bare metal stenting to LAD.

Transthoracic Echo [**2179-6-10**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and
anterior walls and apex. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a pleasant 62 year old male with history of coronary
artery disease and prior NSTEMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
and gout, who presented with chest pain and EKG consistent with
STEMI.

# Chest pain, STEMI:
The patient presented with an anterior STEMI on EKG at [**Location (un) **].
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent cardiac
catherization as noted above. He received a bare metal stent to
his LAD and had POBA to D1. He was loaded with plavix as well.
Aggrastat was continued for 18 hours. He did well post
procedure, and had no additional episodes of chest pain or other
symptoms. At time of dsicharge, he was stablized on a regimen of
25 mg of Toprol XL, 10 mg of lisinopril, 325 mg of aspirin, 80
mg of atorvastatin, and 75 mg of Plavix. He was advised to
continue the Plavix and aspirin unless instructed by a
cardiologist. He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and was advised
to refrain from strenuous activity until that time. He will
likely benefit from cardiac rehabilitation.

# Heart Function: There was no evidence of cardiac failure on
exam. A transthoracic echo was completed that demonstrated
hypokinesis of the anterior wall and apex with an ejection
fraction of 35-40%.  There was no need for anticoagulation based
on this.
He will likely benefit from a repeat echocardiogram in [**3-11**]
months to re-assess his ejection fraction at that time.

# Rhythm: Initially patient had intermittent arrhythmias noted
on telemetry upon arrival to the cardiac intensive care unit
from the catherization lab. These were felt to be consistent
with AIVR. Reportedly there are ambulance strips which showed
improvement of ST elevations and precordial depressions during
transport with IIbIIIa and Heparin, however these were not
located.  Patient was monitored on telemetry without any further
events.

# Hypertension: Patient's blood pressure was at goal with a
systolic ranging from 90-120 on a regimen of metoprolol and
lisinopril.

# Hyperlipidemia: Patient was placed on a higher dose statin of
atorvastatin 80 mg daily.

# Gout, Psoriasis: These were not active issues, and allopurinol
was continued at his home dose.

# Code: Patient was full code during his admission.

# Disposition: Patient was cleared by physical therapy as safe
for discharge home. He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
approximately two weeks after discharge.
