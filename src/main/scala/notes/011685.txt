transferred to the ICU postoperatively for airway observation,
and was kept until [**2120-2-23**], at which time she transferred to the
floor on telemetry. The following is her hospital course:

Neuro/Pain: The patient had a bupivicaine epidural initially
which was dc'd [**2-23**] and pain controlled with PCA dilaudid, then
po dilaudid and tylenol, which was effective. She remained
neurologically intact.

Pulmonary:
Aggresive pulmonary toilet continued with Albuterol and mucomyst
nebs. She was weaned to 2L nasal cannula oxygen at rest and 4L
with ambulation. She used CPAP at night for known OSA. She had a
right chest tube which dc'd [**2-23**] without pneumothorax on post
pull film. She was diuresed x 3 days with lasix 10mg po daily
for pulmonary edema and small right effusion on chest xray,
which improved.

Cardiovascular:
She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her course.

Nutrition:
She was started on sips [**2120-2-22**] which was advanced to a regular
diet and tolerated without dysphagia. She was continued on PPI.

Renal:
She had a foley from the operating room, which was dc'd [**2120-2-23**]
with good urine thereafter. She was started on a bicarb gtt
[**2120-2-23**] for rhabdo with CK max of 19,123 on [**2-22**] and down to
1076 on date of discharge. Her chemistry panel was watched daily
and on date of discharge her creatinine was 0.8, with highest
1.2 date of surgery. Electrolytes were replaced as needed.

Infectious Disease:  The patient's CBC and fever curves were
monitored. She spiked to 102.2 on [**2120-2-22**] and had blood and
urine cultures, which thus far were negative, without
temperatures since [**2120-2-23**]. Vancomycin x2 post-op completed. She
had a right erythematous incision which was stable and not felt
to require any antibiotics.

Dispo: PT evaluated the patient and cleared her for home without
home PT. The patient was ambulating well with controlled pain,
tolerating a regular diet, with ambulatory sats 4L NC of 91-95%.
She was deemed stable for home discharge [**2120-2-26**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was initially going to leave with a service car
but they could not take her oxygen tanks therefore she stayed
another couple of hours until ambulance transport was arranged
to take her with oxygen up to [**State 1727**]. [**Hospital1 5065**] home oxygen was
arranged and were going to deliver a portable tank once she
arrived home.

The patient was given scripts for nebulizers, and will see us in
clinic in two weeks.
