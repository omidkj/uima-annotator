admission (most recent [**11-22**], [**10-23**]) for previous episodes of
paradoxical vocal cord movement vs asthma flare requiring
intubation now presents with a third episode this year. This
weekend, she babysat and exposed to a baby who had a cold and
started having rhinorrhea/dry cough/sob/sore throat since
Sunday. Yesterday, when she was walking to class in cold, she
had what she believed was paradoxical vocal cord movement which
resolved when she arrived to a warm classroom. She believes that
her symptoms get triggered by URI, cold weather and exercise.
When she woke up this morning she started having symptoms again
and presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 37129**] clinic. Per ED, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3878**] noted
paradoxical vocal cord motion in his office and referred her to
ED for sedation to see if this might break the problem.
.
In the ER she received valium 5mg IV x1 but she became sedated
and dropped her oxygen saturation to the low 80/high 70%. She
was placed on Heliox. Her stridor continued. Panting has not
helped to break her symptoms. She was also evaluated by ENT who
scoped her and saw unremarkable vocal cord movement.
.
On ROS, she denies f/c, n/v, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary
or vaginal symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 19F with ? asthma and recurrent episodes of paradoxical
vocal
cord movement, depression and conversion disorder, now with
another paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction.
.
# Paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction: Pt was admitted to MICU in
a stable condition.  Upon speaking to her PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction was likely a psychosomatic
manifestation.  Her O2 sat was monitored closely and her O2 sats
remained in high 90s during her stridor episodes.  Heliox was
weaned off.  Since admission, pt had intermittent mild stridor
and dyspnea (complaining of throat closing up) with flushed face
which did not really respond to Heliox or nebs.  With 1mg iv
ativan and reassurance, pt's strior improved and fell asleep
without stridor during sleep.  ABG and even intubation was
considered upon admission, but given improvement after ativan,
it was held off.  Her URI symptoms improved with pseudoephedrine
and Flonase and Afrin.  Speech therapy evaluated the pt in am
and recommended continuing reassurance, treating nasal
congestion and GERD treatment.  Psych was also consulted and
recommended continuing speech therpy and regular PROPHYLACTIC
visits to pt with ample reassurance. Also recommended using
Ativan 0.5-1mg po/im/iv/prn rather than Valium for
anxiety/agitation.  Pt was discharged from ICU with weekly
follow-up with psych, ENT, Allergy, Speech, Pulmonary, and PCP.
