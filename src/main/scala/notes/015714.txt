Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 67782**] was admitted under the Urology service on [**2137-8-26**] for her planned surgery. She underwent the standard
protocol to be prepared for her procedure. During the surgery,
there were no complications. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. Because of her age and the
amount of blood loss, she remained intubated and was taken to
the intensive care unit for overnight observation. However
hemodynamically, she remained stable. In the recovery room, she
continued to do well and her pain was well-controlled. She was
brought to the floor once a bed was available for furhur care.
On the floor, she did well from a urology point of view.
However, there was some difficult with controlling her blood
pressure. Previously, she had been prescribed verapamil for
blood pressure control, but as an inpatient, it was reccomended
for her to switch to captopril. This was started once she able
to tolerate PO's, however, her blood pressure remained
uncontrolled, and she required some doses of IV hydralazine
during her stay. As per a medicine consult, she was then
switched to lisinopril, and this seemed to have regulated her
blood pressure better, but the patient was advised to
immediately follow-up with her primary care physician in regards
to monitoring her BP and dosage of her medication. In addition,
she was discharged with a visiting nurse for regular BP checks
until she is able to visit her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **], the patient was
advised to repeat her CT scan in regards to the pulmonary
nodules discovered on her previous scann (in 3 months time).
