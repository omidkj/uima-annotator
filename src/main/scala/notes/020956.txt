INDICATIONS: 80 year old man with carotid artery stenosis.
Evaluation of the
vasculature requested.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1, T2, and susceptibility images of the
brain were
obtained. No contrast was administered. MR angiography of the
circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was performed with acquisition of two- and
three- dimensional time-of-flight images. MR angiography of the
neck was also performed with two- and three-dimensional
time- of- flight images of the major arteries.

FINDINGS: On the brain images, there is no evidence of
hydrocephalus, mass
effect, or shift of the normally midline structures. The
ventricles,
cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable. There are patchy areas of
increased T2
signal in the pons. There are also widespread patchy areas of
increased T2
signal in the subcortical white matter of both cerebral
hemispheres. These
signal abnormalities are consistent with chronic small vessel
ischemic
infarcts. Also, in the posterosuperior right frontal cortex,
there is a small
area of increased T2 signal in the cortex consistent with a
chronic
infarction. A similar small infarct in the head of the left
caudate nucleus
is also observed. No susceptibility artifact is seen. The
visualized
vascular flow voids are present. The osseous structures, soft
tissues, and
sinuses are unremarkable. MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
shows no evidence of stenosis in the major vessels. Along the
proximal right posterior cerebral artery, there is a tiny focus
of increased signal intensity on the two-dimensional
time-of-flight images. In the source images, there is no
suggestion of an aneurysm at that site. This small focus appears
to be an artifact. There is no definite
evidence of an aneurysm. MR angiography of the carotid and
vertebral arteries in the neck is significant for a severe
stenosis beyond the bifurcation in the left proximal internal
carotid artery. Only mild carotid narrowing is seen at the left
carotid bifurcation. The left carotid bifurcation is more
superiorly located
than the right, and accordingly, three-dimensional time-
of-flight images
understandably did not entirely cover this area. The severe left
proximal
internal carotid stenosis is best visualized on the
two-dimensional time- of-
flight images. On the right side, on both the two- and
three-dimensional
time-of- flight images, a probable moderate to severe right
carotid stenosis
at the bifurcation, and moderate to severe right proximal
internal carotid
stenosis is also seen.

IMPRESSION: The head MRI shows evidence of widespread patchy
increased T2
signal. These are are consistent with chronic small vessel
ischemic infarcts. The MR angiogram of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
shows no definite evidence of stenosis or aneurysm. The MR
angiogram of the neck is significant for a severe left internal
carotid artery stenosis beyond the bifurcation, with mild
stenosis at the bifurcation. On the right, there is evidence of
moderate to severe stenosis at the
bifurcation and in the proximal internal carotid artery.

HISTORY: 80 y/o man s/p bivalve ICD placement. R/O RV lead
dislodgement.
COMPARISON: [**2128-6-12**].
CHEST AP: The tip of the right ventricular lead appears to have
rotated into
the right atrium. The right atrial and coronary sinus leads are
in unchanged
position. Cardiac and mediastinal and hilar contours are stable
in appearance.
Pulmonary vasculature is normal. The lungs are clear. There are
no pleural
effusions. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Displacement of right ventricular ICD lead into the
right atrium.
Procedure Date:[**2128-6-24**]

[**Known lastname 23052**],[**Known firstname 177**]:[**Hospital1 18**] Radiology Detail - CCC Record #[**Numeric Identifier 23053**]
History: Defibrillator lead change.
Chest, PA and Lateral: The heart is normal in size. A
difibrillator is
present on the left anterior chest wall, and there are two RV
leads and a
single RA lead. There is no pneumothorax. There are no signs of
failure and
there are no focal infiltrates. Nodular calcifications in the
left mid lung
zone are likely related to previous granulomatous disease. There
is no
mediastinal adenopathy. There is no effusion or bone
destruction.
Procedure Date:[**2128-6-26**]


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted for stent placement in the left ICA. Pt. returned from
cath with 1.5 mcg/kg/min of phenylephrine, successfully weaned.
Pt. experienced brief bouts of non-specific bilateral radiating
numbness but with consistently normal CNII-XII exam; likely
transient vagal depression nature. The patient also has a
biventricular ICD implanted, which was interrogated prior to the
stent procedure. It was determined that the RV lead/ICD had
become dislodged. The defibrillator function was disabled,
leaving the device operating as an RA/LV DDD pacer. CXR
indicated that the RV lead had ascended into the RA. The pacer
function began to be impaired by erroneous sensing, with pacing
occuring on the ST segment leading to brief aberrant NSVT runs.
EP put the ICD into [**Last Name (un) **] (sense-only) mode, and the patients
leads were then percutaneously resited satisfactorily as
confirmed by repeat CXR. ICD function was tested and found to be
satisfactory. The patient did well after carotid stenting and
ICD lead revision and was subsequently discharged home with
assistance in stable and improved condition.
