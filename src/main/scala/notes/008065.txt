Pertinent Results:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2167-5-11**] 4:38 AM


Final Report
INDICATION: 45-year-old male with intracranial bleed, status
post intubation.
Evaluate ET tube placement.

COMPARISON: No prior study available for comparison.

SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are low.
Endotracheal tube
terminates 1.8 cm above the carina and should be pulled back by
approximately 1 or 2 cm. No focal consolidation. Retrocardiac
opacity Likely represents atelectasis. Allowing for low lung
volumes, cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No appreciable
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5877**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10754**] at 6:00 AM on [**2167-5-11**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2167-5-11**] 4:39 AM

Final Report
INDICATION: 45-year-old male with cerebellar bleed. Evaluate for

progression.

COMPARISON: [**2167-5-11**] at 2:34 a.m. from [**Hospital3 934**]
Hospital for
which no report is available in PACS.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain. No
contrast was administered.

FINDINGS: There is a large irregular-shaped hyperdense
collection in the
posterior fossa. The lesion is bilobed and the larger portion of
the lesion is approximately 4.6 x 2.7 cm, similar to prior.
Hyperdense products track along the tentorium and posterior
portion of the brainstem. In addition, there is slight increase
in blood products within the bilateral occipital horns and third
ventricle. The size of the ventricles is similar to the scan
performed two hours prior. There is surrounding edema and
effacement of the cerebellar folia and mass effect on the fourth
ventricle. There is effacement of the perimesencephalic
cisterns.
No major vascular territory infarction. Globes and lenses are
intact. Mild
bilateral ethmoid mucosal thickening. Osseous structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Overall, no change in large irregular-shaped
posterior fossa
hemorrhage compared to the prior study. Slight increase in
intraventricular blood products in the bilateral occipital
horns, with slight increase in the diameter of the lateral
ventricles compared to the prior study. Mild unchanged tonsillar
and ascending transtentorial herniation. CTA should be consider
to rule out underlying vascular lesion or mass.



CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2167-5-11**] 6:04 AM


FINDINGS:

CTA HEAD: There has been no significant interval change in the
large
irregular-shaped hyperdense collection within the posterior
fossa when
compared with the prior non-contrast CT examination performed
earlier the same day, [**2167-5-11**] at 4:55 a.m. Hyperdense blood
products are again seen layering along the tentorium and
posterior portion of the brainstem.

There has been interval right frontal ventriculostomy catheter
placement with tip in the body of the right lateral ventricle.
There is intraparenchymal hemorrhage surrounding the
ventriculostomy catheter with greatest dimension 4.3 cm AP x 2.5
cm transverse in the right frontal lobe and new mass effect on
the right lateral ventricle. There is no significant shift of
the normally midline structures.

There has been interval increase in intraventricular blood
products within the right lateral ventricle. There are stable
blood products within the third ventricle and right occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**]. Again seen is effacement of the
perimesencephalic cisterns with probable mild right-sided uncal
herniation.  There is no cerebellar tonsillar herniation. There
is no evidence of acute territorial infarction.

The vertebrobasilar system is diminutive but patent, which may
be reflective of arterial vasospasm. The posterior cerebral
arteries are patent but diminutive, which also may be secondary
to vasospasm. There is no evidence of flow-limiting stenosis,
occlusion, aneurysm greater than 2 mm, or arteriovenous
malformation.

The patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube is
within the right mainstem bronchus. There is fluid within the
nasopharynx and esophagus.

CTA NECK: The great vessels at the level of the aortic arch are
within normal limits. The vertebral artery origins are
unremarkable. The paired vertebral arteries are diminutive in
their entirety, but patent.

The common, internal, and external carotid arteries are normal
in course and caliber without evidence of flow-limiting
stenosis, occlusion, or dissection.  There are numerous
bilateral cervical chain lymph nodes, none of which are enlarged
by CT criteria. The thyroid gland is heterogeneous and enlarged,
right greater than left.

There are biapical atelectatic changes.

Cross-sectional analysis of the internal carotid arteries is as
follows.

On the right: Proximal D min 7.6 mm; distal D min 4.3 mm.

On the left: Proximal D min 9.6 mm; distal D min 4.5 mm.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of the large irregularly shaped posterior
fossa
intraparenchymal hemorrhage when compared with the previous
examination. No evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous
malformation to suggest etiology of this hematoma.
2. Status post right frontal approach ventriculostomy shunt
catheter
placement with surrounding intraparenchymal hematoma and new
mass effect on the right lateral ventricle. Interval increase in
intraventricular blood products.
3. Multinodular goiter. Ultrasound may be obtained for further
evaluation if not already performed.

4. The tip of the endotracheal tube is within the right mainstem
bronchus.

5. Questionable vasospasm of the posterior circulation.
Recommend continued short term interval follow-up.



CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2167-5-12**] 4:10 AM


FINDINGS: The patient is status post suboccipital craniectomy
and evacuation of a left cerebellar hematoma. Pneumocephalus in
the posterior fossa and subcutaneous emphysema are expected in
the setting of recent surgery. A linear hyperdensity in the
surgical bed, consistent with blood products, is new since the
prior study. Residual blood is seen in the right cerebellar
hemisphere and layering along the tentorium. There is unchanged
effacement of the cerebellar folia with compression of the
fourth ventricle.

A left frontal approach
