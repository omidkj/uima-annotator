from [**Hospital **] Hospital for management of congestive heart
failure.  He is a 74 year-old male with a long standing
history of coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2108**], ischemic cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 10 to 15%, history of recurrent
ventricular tachycardia status post automatic internal
cardiac defibrillator placement, diabetes, hypothyroid now
presenting with shortness of breath.  The patient initially
presented approximately one week ago to [**Hospital6 23442**] with abdominal discomfort.  He underwent an
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and was also
treated for congestive heart failure.  His liver enzymes were
noted to be elevated.  Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography was unremarkable.  The patient was
discharged home and returned two days later with congestive
heart failure.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus.  2.  Coronary artery bypass graft [**2108**].  3.  Stress
SPECT showed a small to moderate ischemic deficit in the
lateral and inferolateral wall.  4.  Cardiac catheterization
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease, severe global
systolic dysfunction, normal right ventricular systolic
dysfunction, occluded saphenous vein graft - RI occluded
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, patent saphenous
vein graft to left anterior descending coronary artery and
saphenous vein graft to D3.  5.  Congestive heart failure
with an ejection fraction of 10%.  6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Hypothyroidism.  8.  Status post appendectomy.  9.
Status post hernia repair.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin with a reaction of hives.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired liquor store owner.  He
smoked tobacco for fifteen years.  He quit [**2090**].  He reports
positive ethanol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease and
diabetes.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1.  Potassium chloride.  2.
Coreg. 3.  Digoxin.  4. Ecotrin.  5.  Colace.  6. Synthroid.
7.  Accupril.  8.  Bumex.  9.  Aldactone.  10.
Amitriptyline.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 95.5.  Blood pressure
98/62.  Heart rate 64.  Respirations 20.  98% on room air.
His neck had positive JVD to the angle of the jaw.
Cardiovascular examination regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and
S2 present.  2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur laterally
displaced point of maximal impulse.  Lungs had crackles one
third of the way up his lungs.  His abdomen was soft and
nontender.  His extremities had 2+ edema.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit 40.8,
platelets 137, INR 1.5, PTT 33.5, sodium 133, potassium 4.9,
chloride 94, bicarb 32, BUN 28, creatinine 1.6, glucose 192,
ALT 125, AST 36, alkaline phosphatase 145, total bili was
1.0, digoxin was .7, calcium 8.4, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus
3.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
Service and placed on telemetry.  He was continued on
intravenous diuresis with 80 mg of Lasix intravenous b.i.d.
His ace inhibitor dose was increased as tolerated.
Electrophysiology consultation was obtained to consider
biventricular pacing.  Insulin was continued for the control
of his diabetes and Synthroid was continued for the control
of his hypothyroidism.  On [**2119-2-23**] the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization for further evaluation of his cardiac
anatomy.  This revealed severe three vessel coronary artery
disease and occluded saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
and D3, patent saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to ramus.
This also revealed moderately elevated left and right sided
filling pressures with mild pulmonary hypertension.  A
electrophisiology study was performed.  His AICD was
reprogrammed to AV paced at 80.  On [**2119-2-24**] electrophysiology
reported that their plan was to wait for the FDA approval of
an in since device and put it in under research protocol.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one
to two months.

On [**2119-2-24**] the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit for inotropics and observation.  PA catheter was placed
and intravenous Milrinone was started.  The patient did well
with Milrinone and experienced symptomatic improvement and
diuresed approximately 7 liters.  The patient experienced
thrombocytopenia down to 78.  Heparin antibodies were
negative.  On [**2119-3-1**] the patient was transferred back to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service.  He reported that he felt well and denied chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting fevers or chills.
He was afebrile with stable vital signs.  His platelet count
had increased to 105.  On [**2119-3-2**] overnight events for the
patient was mildly hypotensive with a systolic pressure of 86
to 98.  His examination was remarkable for fine crackles one
third of the way up his lungs.  His weight was 75.4
kilograms.  He had no JVD.  He had no peripheral edema.
Coumadin was started.  On [**2119-3-3**] the patient was doing well
with no complaints.  Blood pressure ranges from 82 to 90/60
to 62.  His Is and Os were negative 100 AV cc the previous
day.  His weight was stable at 75.4 kilograms.  His
examination was unchanged.  His PTT was 150 and his INR was
2.1.  This was rechecked at 4:00 p.m. and his INR was found
to be 1.3 after his heparin had been turned off.  His
creatinine was 1.6.
