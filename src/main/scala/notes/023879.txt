Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old
female, who had been experiencing increasing chest tightness
over the few months prior to admission.  She was born with a
heart murmur and was followed by serial echocardiograms.  She
did have a presyncopal episode and recently prior to her
increasing dyspnea on exertion.  Her cardiac catheterization
done in [**2176-5-30**] showed an EF of 64% with mild MR and
normal coronaries with an aortic valve area of 0.8 cm
squared.

[**Last Name (STitle) 48142**]ardiogram done more recently showed an aortic valve
area of 0.5 cm squared.  She was then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] for aortic valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Aortic stenosis.
2. Asthmatic bronchitis for which she takes rare antibiotics.
3. Anxiety attacks.
4. Migraines.
5. Hypertension.
6. Obesity.
7. She has an old fourth finger fracture on her left hand.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Total abdominal hysterectomy in [**2166**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Vasotec 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Estrace 5 or 10 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Prempro which gives her a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is an office worker, who lives with her
boyfriend and her son.  She never smoked.  She rarely drinks
alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for the fact that she wears
[**Location (un) 1131**] glasses.  She has asthmatic bronchitis.  She does
experience palpitations and did have presyncopal episode.
She has constipation and hemorrhoids with a negative
colonoscopy three years ago.  She has no history of CVA or
TIA, and remaining review of systems is noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a pleasant female in no
apparent distress.  Her vital signs include a heart rate of
72, blood pressure of 152/90 in the right and 148/98 on the
left.  Her skin has no obvious disease.  Her HEENT was PERRL.
EOMI.  She is nonicteric.  Her neck is supple with no JVD.
Cardiac:  Aortic stenosis, murmur radiates to her neck
bilaterally.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart is regular, rate, and rhythm with a 4/6 systolic
ejection murmur that radiates throughout the precordium.  Her
abdomen is obese, it is soft, it is nontender and
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  She has no
hepatosplenomegaly, no CVA tenderness.  Her extremities are
warm and well perfused.  She has no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  She has no noted varicosities.  Her neurological
examination shows her to be grossly intact with no focal
abnormalities and her cranial nerves are intact.  Her pulses
show 1+ bilaterally in femoral artery.  Her dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses are 2+ bilaterally and renal
arteries are 2+ bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient underwent aortic valve replacement
by minimally invasive incision with a #[**Street Address(2) 6158**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve.  The surgery is performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2545**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], PA-C as assistants.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal
anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 120 minutes
with a cross-clamp time of 88 minutes.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well, and was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit normal sinus rhythm and on Neo-Synephrine and propofol
drips.

In the Intensive Care Unit, she was weaned off propofol, and
was noted to be very acidotic.  She was put back on the
propofol while respiratory acidosis was fixed.  She had her
acidosis corrected, and was eventually weaned to CPAP and
extubated on the evening of the operative night without
incident.

On the morning of postoperative day #1, she was doing well
until she was noted to have right sided weakness, which was
transient in nature.  She did have a head CT which showed no
evidence of hemorrhage and went for cerebral angiogram to
assess her carotids and intracranial vessels.  This was done
and showed no evidence of carotid dissection or branch
occlusion.  Over the day, her symptoms resolved and she was
eventually able to move all extremities and have good
strength on her right side.

Over the next couple of days, she was kept on a
Neo-Synephrine drip to keep her blood pressure in the
140s-160s.  During this time, she continued to have
improvement of her right sided weakness.  She was started on
Coumadin for her mechanical valve.

By postoperative day #3, was off of her Neo-Synephrine drip
and able to be transferred to the surgical floor.  She
continued to do well and worked with Physical Therapy and
Cardiac Rehab.  Her wires were discontinued on postoperative
day #3 without incident and she was continued on her Heparin
and Coumadin for anticoagulation.

She continued to do well until postoperative day #8 when it
was noted that she had positive E. coli UTI by culture.  She
was started on Levaquin to which the E. coli was sensitive.

By postoperative day #9, she was noted to have therapeutic
INR of 2.4 which will allow her to be discharged to home.
She will have visiting nurse services to help assess her
wound healing and also to cover her coags.  Her coags will be
followed by Dr. ............'s office.

Her discharge exam shows her to be alert and oriented times
three, moving all extremities with good grip strength.  Her
vital signs are stable, and her lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart regular, rate, and rhythm.
Abdomen has positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Her extremities without clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  Her sternal wound is stable and clean, dry, and
intact.

Her laboratories on discharge include a white count of 11.2,
hematocrit of 26.1%, platelet count of 566,000.  Sodium 138,
potassium 5.0, chloride 103, CO2 26, BUN 12, creatinine 0.6,
and glucose of 92.  Her PT was 19.1, INR 2.4, and PTT of 44.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for seven days.
2. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for seven days.
3. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Estradiol 1 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x10 days.
6. Coumadin:  She should take 5 mg on the day of discharge,
and her dosage thereafter will be directed as per Dr.
............'s office.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post aortic valve replacement with a #21 mm St.
Jude valve on [**12-30**].
2. Status post transient ischemic attack on [**12-31**] with
no residual.
3. Hypertension.
4. Asthmatic bronchitis.
