CXR FINDINGS: [**2112-4-17**]: Despite the given history, the previously
placed right upper extremity PICC line has been removed on the
current study. The study is markedly limited secondary to
habitus and AP portable technique. The patient's chin obscures
the lung apices, left worse than right. There are bilateral
effusions. The one on the left has worsened. There is relatively
[**Name2 (NI) 15410**] retrocardiac opacity, which is likely in part due to
atelectasis. Evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature is markedly
limited, however, there is no discrete pulmonary vascular
clarity and a mild element of superimposed edema cannot be
excluded. The effusion at the right lung base results in opacity
and an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. The bones are
diffusely osteopenic with degenerative changes throughout the
thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION: Limited examination secondary to multiple factors.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right
with resultant bibasilar opacity, likely atelectasis. An occult
pneumonia in the right lung base cannot be entirely excluded on
the basis of this examination.

ENT consult: Fiberoptic exam: Epiglottis within normal limits,
no erythema or
edema;  circumferential narrowing of the supraglottis, but the
true cords are able to be visualized, and are mobile.  The
airway
diameter is approximately 3 mm.  Unable to visualize the
subglottis.


Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted for evaluation of failure to wean from rehab.
Bronch was done on HD#1 which revealed supraglottic edema and
distal stenosis. Evaluated by ENT -thought chronic supra glottic
narrowing possibly d/t infectious etiology. Recommneded and
ordered airway CT.
