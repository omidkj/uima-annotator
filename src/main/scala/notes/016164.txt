s/p stellate ganglion block


History of Present Illness:
67 y/o female with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (possibly
from myocarditis presumed viral >10 years ago) with LVEF of 20%
(non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation (improved on
recent echo), BiV ICD, who was admitted to CCU in late [**Month (only) 359**]
for VT ablation following ICD discharges in [**Month (only) **]. During
the procedure, it was found that she has multiple inducible VT's
arising from septum, lateral wall and apex. Ablation attempt not
performed given septal origin of VT. She was discharged home on
Mexiletine rather than Amiodarone. Following that discharge, she
continued to have frequent sustained VT, and was subsequently
readmitted [**10-22**] with more symptomatic VT which was paced and not
shocked. During that admission, she had an EP study and
attempted VT ablation at the anterior septal aspect of the
subaortic valve region. Carvedilol and Mexiletine were held
prior to the procedure. She was then started on Metoprolol and
titrated up to Metoprolol XL 50 mg PO BID. She was observed off
Mexiletine without further significant episodes and discharged
home on [**2114-10-25**].
.
This morning she was walking from her bathroom and felt
palpitations with associated lightheadedness for approximately
30 seconds. Her ICD subsequently fired and then fired again 30
seconds later. Her palpitations resolved
She was observed while she was off the mexiletine with no
significant episodes and sent home [**2114-10-25**]. This AM, she was
walking from her bathroom and felt palpitations and
lightheadedness for approximately 30 seconds. Her ICD fired, and
then fired again 30 seconds later. After the second shock, she
was no longer sympatomatic from her palps. She denied chest
pain/pressure, SOB, nausea during this episode.
.
She was instructed to present to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival, EP
interrogated the device which showed VT at a rate of ~120 BPM,
which was attempted to be broken by ATP twice and ultimately
shocked twice with escalating joules. On arrival to the floor,
she initially felt well without any palpitations or
lightheadedness. She subsequently developed VT to 110s-120s. She
then received Ativan 1 mg IV and Lidocaine 100 mg IV once at
1400 with subsequent resolution of her VT. At 1755 she again
went into VT and recevied Metoprolol 5 m IV once and an
additional 50 mg IV Lidocaine. This episode resolved as well but
40 minutes later she again went into VT and received Fentanyl 25
mg IV and Metoprolol 5 mg IV. The VT again resolved but the
patient was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, the patient was calm and was no longer
in VT. She felt well only reporting a fluttering in her chest
when in VT.

STRESS EKG
INTERPRETATION: This 67 year old woman with LVEF of 20% and
history
of dilated cardiomyopathy and VT was referred to the lab for
evaluation.
The patient exercised for 4.5 minutes of a modified [**Doctor Last Name 4001**]/RAMP

protocol and asked the test be stopped for fatigue. The
estimated peak
MET capacity was 1.5 which represents a poor functional
capacity. No
arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient
throughout the study. The ST segments are uninterpretable for
ischemia
in the setting of the v-paced rhythm. The rhythm was a-v paced
with
rare isolated vpbs. Resting hypotension with a slight increase
in
systolic BP with exercise.
IMPRESSION: No symptoms or sustained ectopy with uninterpretable
ST
segments at the achieved level of exercise.


Brief Hospital Course:
67-year-old woman with an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with
LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation
(improved on recent echo), BiV ICD, recent study for
endocardial/epicardial ablation of multifocal VT that were found
to arise from septum, lateral wall and apex, recently ablated
[**2114-10-25**]. Discharged on toprol XL. Now presenting with recurrent
VT and shocks x2.
.
ACTIVE ISSUE:
# Ventricular tachycardia: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent a succesful
stellate ganglion block. After this procedure she did not have
any episodes of VT demonstrating a significant smpathetic
component to her VT. She was also started on Quinidine. She will
follow up with EP to decide on the long term plan as the
stellate ganglion block is not expected to permanently suppress
her arrhythmia.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Chronic, LVEF 20%. NY Class III/IV per

outpt notes which has worsened recently from II. On CHF regimen
including carvedilol, spironolactone, and torsemide.
.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.7 on admission
and trended down to 1.4 on discharge. This appears to be her
baseline per our records.
