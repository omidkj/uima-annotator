Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Septic arthritis and sepsis, Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Revision left total knee replacement one component ([**4-23**])
Aspiration of right knee ([**4-23**])
PICC line placement ([**4-29**])


History of Present Illness:
74 yo man with multiple medical problems including CAD, ESRD on
HD (MWF, last HD today), respiratory failure s/p trach/peg, vent
dependent at night and history of multiple infections with
history of left TKR presents from [**Hospital1 **] with concern for
evolving sepsis. His knee had been replaced ~7 years ago and
recently there had been concern about evolving infection due to
knee pain x 1 month leading to several joint taps, last reported
tap 2 days ago. He was started on daptomycin on [**4-10**] for MRSA
septic arthritis and meropenem was added on [**4-13**], reports
allergy to vancomycin. He had a midline placed on [**4-19**]. He was
noted to be febrile and tachycardic with borderline hypotension
and was [**Last Name (un) 4662**] to ED today due to concern that he was becoming
septic.

On arrival to the ED his VS were 101.8 121 (in AF, known),
112/71 RR30s 93% on 6L trach mask. Ortho saw pt, consult in
chart, basically recommended ICU admission with antibiotics and
OR in am for washout. His knee has been tapped and cultured,
blood cultures were also sent. Synovial fluid with 180K WBCs.
His chest xray showed R HD catheter in place, b/l pleural
effusions knee film showed an effusion, osteomyelitis could not
be excluded. Labs notable for normal lactate at 1.6, normal
electrolytes, elevated BUN/Cr and phos c/w chronic renal
failure, anemic and thrombocytopenic with no known baseline. INR
1.3. Came in with PICC, had 2 PIVs placed in ED. He was given 1L
NS as well as tylenol and meropenem and was admitted to the ICU
for continued monitoring. At the time of transfer his VS:
110s SBP 90s 20s 98% on 6L trach mask.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was initially alert, some
speech latency but cooperative fully with exam and questioning.
Only complaint was [**8-10**] knee pain which had been stable for past
3 weeks. Noted 1 episode of fever today. Pain tolerable when
still, otherwise takes tylenol and oxycodone for it. Not
ambulatory. On review of systems, denies headache, neck
stiffness, vision changes, focal numbness or weakness. No change
in respiratory status, no chest discomfort. No nausea or
vomiting or change in ostomy output. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN at NH, has trouble
with ostomy output at baseline requiring ostomy stimulation
three times a week. Denies confusion or lightheadedness. Per NH
and records pt will have intermittent periods of
"unresponsiveness" thought to potentially be seizures for which
he takes keppra. Does not make urine. No other joint pains. C/o
some chronic LBP at site of sacral ulcer.

He was given 2L NS for borderline BPs and decreased
responsiveness, transiently required dopamine. Left subclavian
central line placement attempted unsuccsesfully, was aborted
after BP increased to 110s. Was continued on meropenem and
daptomycin.

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**4-24**]):
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular
function is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
