IMPRESSION: No pneumonia

Brief Hospital Course:
This 38 year old gentleman with a history of asthma presented to
an OSH with asthma flare and was transferred to this hospital
early morning [**8-5**] for further management.  He was tachycardic
(110-130) but with stable blood pressure on transfer.  He
remained with signs and symptoms of asthma exacerbation despite
continuous bronchodilator therapy, oxygen support and high dose
steroids.  He was mildly hypoxemic (PO2 70, pulse ox O2 sat 93%
off nebs) but ventilating normally as shown by ABG and did not
require intubation.  Initial lactate at 9.2.  He was transferred
to MICU for monitoring.  The patient was maintained on
continuous bronchodilators and continued on high dose steroids
and oxygen support.  His oxygen saturation improved over the
early morning and he was transitioned to bronchidilator therapy
every three hours.  His tachycardia improved and he began to
oxygenate normally on room air.  Lactate trended downward to
2.8.  The patient was subsequently discharged on prednisone
taper and with instructions to follow up with [**Hospital1 18**] Pulmonology
as well as his primary care physician.
.
In summary, this is a 38 year old asthmatic gentleman who
presented with respiratory distress secondary to asthma flare
successfully treated with oxygen support, bronchodilator
therapy, steroids.  H was admitted to the ICU for observation as
he was somewhat slow to respond to treatment and for his
elevated lactate.  He respiratory function returned to baseline
shortly after ICU admission and he never showed signs of
failure.  Lactate levels were near normalized within hours.  Pt
discharged on prednisone taper.
.
Issues and plan from this hospitalization
.
1) Asthma Exacerbation- Exacerbation in setting of recent URI. .
Diffuse wheeze on exam. Peak Flow 150. Less likely secondary to
alternative process (ie PE); low clinical prob (0-2) by [**Doctor Last Name **]
criteria.
-treated initially with continuous nebs x 1, followed by
standing q3 albuterol/atrovent neb.  Also O2 support, steroids
-pt to continue prednisone taper over 14 days.
-continue home dose of Advair
-PRN albuterol
-Arranged for outpatient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 7474**] of [**Hospital1 18**] Pulmonary Service
.
2) Metabolic Acidosis- Anion gap acidosis in setting of high
lactate. Likely in setting of prolonged work of breathing.
Follow serial chemistries, ABG.
-lactate 2.8 on discharge, down from 9.2 on admission.
.
Prophylaxis consisted of subcutaneous heparin and bowel regimen.
