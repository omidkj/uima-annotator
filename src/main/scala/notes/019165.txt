79 yo M with history of CHF w/ EF 15%, CAD, HTN presents with
hypoxia, hemoptysis and ? hemetemesis.
.
Patient describe increasing dyspnea over the past couple of week
and worsening day prior to admission. Patient claims that at
baseline, walking is difficult for him but he is not SOb at
rest. Since yesterday, he had severe SOB even at rest and was
urged by neighbor to come to the [**Name (NI) **]. He denies chest pain or
dietary indiscretion. Patient claims that he is very compliant
with medication, especially lasix. He noted that his leg
ballooned up since yesterday. He also complains of fatigue in
the past few days.
.

none today. He also reports posttusive vomiting w/ blood x 6
times yesterday associated with abdominal discomfort. He could
not quantitate the amount of blood but claims "it is not a lot".

CXR FINDINGS: The heart size is markedly enlarged, with
unchanged configuration, but increased size in comparison to the
previous film. These findings in the absence of frank pulmonary
edema should raise suspicion of pericardial effusion. The
mediastinum is central, with mild aortic calcifications.

There is new right lower lobe consolidation and less prominent,
but definitely present right middle lobe consolidation. On the
previous chest radiograph, right middle lobe opacity has been
demonstrated, suggesting the chronic nature of this process.
There is no sizeable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:

1. Markedly enlarged heart size. The possibility of pericardial
effusion should be considered.

2. Right lower lobe and right middle lobe consolidation,
concerning for pneumonia. This may be recurrent, but chronic
consolidation (e.g. bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma) cannot be
excluded given previous CXR abnormality, and follow-up
radiographs after completion of antibiotic therapy are necessary
to ensure resolution.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with
severe global systolic dysfunction. [Intrinsic systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral
regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root and
ascending aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia:
Patient admitted to the ICU for management of hypoxia in the
setting of multilobar pneumonia and CHF.  CXR showed right
middle lobe and right lower lobe infiltrate.  BNP was grossly
elevated.  In the ED he received vancomycin, ceftazidime, lasix
and was started on a nitro gtt.  He required transient BIPAP.
Cardiology was consulted given a concern for pericardial
effusion which by bedside ECHO appeared to be present but was
not causing tamponade.  In the ICU he was started on
ceftriaxone/azithro for his pneumonia.  Urine legionella antigen
was sent and was negative.  Sputum culture was sent but was
nondiagnostic.  He was diuresed and improved significantly.  He
was called out to the floor on hospital day # 4.  A subsequent
formal ECHO in the ICU showed no evidence of pericardial
effusion but an EF < 20% with 2+MR, 2+TR, and restrictive LV
inflow pattern with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension and
pulmonic regurgitation.  He continued to diurese on the floor
with stable creatinine and was ultimately weaned off all
supplemental oxygen.  He remained afebrile and his wbc improved
to normal.  He was discharged home on cefpodoxime 200 mg po bid
x 5 days to complete a total 10 day course of antibiotics.  He
was discharged on his home dose of lasix and enalapril, and he
will follow-up with his PCP in order to restart his BB.
.
# Hemoptysis:
Patient reported hemoptysis x 4-5 times the day prior to
admission.  He also reported vomiting up a
