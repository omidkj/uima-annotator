Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
IC mass lesion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L craniotomy for resection of frontal mass


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 21976**] [**Known lastname **] is a 52 yo right handed man with no significant
past medical history transferred here from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for
evaluation of a brain mass.

Mr. [**Known firstname 21976**] states he had been in good health until approximately
10 days ago when he noted weakness in his right arm.  He had
difficulty writing, holding utensils to eat.  He thought his
weakness was related to the use of Icy-Hot on his right shoulder
(treating chronic shoulder pain).  However, he then noted
difficulty walking, feeling as though his knees would buckle. He
also noticed he was more likely to fall after having a drink in
the evening. This progressed to the point that he sought
evaluation today at his local ED.  There, a CT of the head w/wo
contrast identified a 3cm left frontal/parietal mass.  He was
referred here for further evaluation.

The patient denies any headache, changes in vision, vertigo,
nausea, or vomiting.  He has a feeling of numbness over the
right
deltoid and his right face.  He has chronic decreased appetite
and notes slight weight loss over the past year.  He denies
fevers, chills, nightsweats, cough, abdominal pain, changes in
bowels/urinary habits, hematachezia or or any other systemic
symptom.

Reason: eval for mass



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   52 year old man with new head mass
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for mass



Provisional Findings Impression: JBRe FRI [**2129-4-1**] 7:04 PM
INDICATION: 62-year-old man with new head mass. Please evaluate
for mass.

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were
obtained.

COMPARISON: CT of the head from an outside hospital scanned into
the PACS
system of [**Hospital1 18**] at 10:30 on [**2129-4-1**].

FINDINGS:

There is bilateral upper lobe increased lucency with still
visible pulmonary
vasculature and no evidence of pneumothorax. These findings are
consistent
with severe bilateral upper lobe emphysematous or bullous
changes. Right
middle lobe plate-like atelectasis and mass-like parenchymal
distortion in the
left lingula might represent scarring or mass.

The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal. There is
no pleural
pathology. There are no bony or soft tissue abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:

1. Severe bilateral upper lobe emphysematous/bullous changes.

2. Left lingula mass-like parenchymal distortion might represent
scaring or
neoplasm. CT might be considered for further workup if
clinically indicated.


Final Report
INDICATION: 62-year-old man with new head mass. Please evaluate
for mass.

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were
obtained.

COMPARISON: NONE.

FINDINGS:
There is bilateral upper lobe increased lucency with visible
pulmonary
vasculature and no evidence of pneumothorax. These findings are
consistent
with severe bilateral upper lobe emphysematous/bullous changes.
Right middle
lobe plate-like atelectasis. Large area of parenchymal
distortion in the
lingular lung might represent scarring, although underlying mass
can not be
excluded and is of concern.


IMPRESSION:
1. Severe bilateral upper lobe emphysematous/bullous changes.
2. Left lingula mass-like parenchymal distortion might represent
scaring
and/or neoplasm. Chest CT recommended for further evaluation.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
