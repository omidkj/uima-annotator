Brief Hospital Course:
72 y/o male transferred from the [**Location (un) **] emergency room to [**Hospital1 18**]
with free air after repair of a perf'd duodenal ulcer 10 days
prior and 5 days prior an operation for secondary closure of
wound dehiscence. He had just been discharged when he presented
with severe abdominal pain which quickly progressed to shock. A
CT scan revealed free air in the abdomen and the patient ws
taken to the OR for an ex-lap where he was found to have a
perforated transverse colon. He was washed out and given a
colostomy. Post operatively he was admitted to the SICU where he
required pressors and was intubated. He was started on
vanc/levo/flagyl/fluc and maintained on a neo and epi drip. On
POD #6 a dobhoff was placed and he was started on tube feeds
which were increased to goal. His blood cultures grew vanc
resistant enterococcus and so he was switched from vanc to
linezolid. On POD # 10 the drainage from his wound had increased
and he developed an enterocutaneous fistula. On POD 12 a fluid
collection was drained and 125cc of fluid was removed from his
abdomen. Pt. began tolerating trach trials on POD #15 and on POD
#18 a percutaneous tracheostomy was performed. It was decided to
manage his low output fistula with conservative meausures. On
POD #21 the patient was weaned and remained on trach collar for
24 hours. On POD 26, while off the vent and pressors, the
patient failed a speech and swallow eval and failed a passt-muir
valve test. On POD #29 the patient was transferred to the floor.
His dressing over his fistula were changed to a wound vac, which
has been changed every 3 days. Since being on the floor the
patient has remained stable. He continues to live in Afib
chronically, his 02 sats have been good, and he is tolerating
his trach collar and tube feeds well. His fistula has decreased
output and on POD #38 he failed his sppech and swallow once
again. He was seen by ENT who recommened keeping HOB > 45%,
start nexium, and speech/swallow eval later on this month. All
antibiotics were stopped on [**2157-7-19**]. THe patient will be
transferred in stable condition to rehab.
