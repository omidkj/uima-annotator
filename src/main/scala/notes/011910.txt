Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peritoneal dialysis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8014**] is a 58 year old male with history of Hepatitis C
with portal gastropathy, RCC s/p nephrectomy, ESRD on PD, CAD
s/p NSTEMI with RCA BMS stent ([**5-4**]) now off plavix, chronic
LGIB presents with 1 day of non-productive cough and worsening
shortness of breath at rest. At baseline he is able to ambulate
approximately [**Age over 90 **] yards before getting fatigued, however over
the past day he has been increasingly short of breath with
minimal exertion and yesterday morning was short of breath at
rest. He also reports one to two minutes of substernal chest
pressure this afternoon which resolved spontaneously - notes
that this was very different from CP in [**Month (only) 547**]. No radiation or
associated diaphoresis or nausea. In [**Month (only) 547**] he describes more
intense chest pressure with left arm numbness and vomiting. Of
note, he recently travelled to Foxwoods and noted that he did
not take his medications for 2 days (Sunday/Monday) and had many
dietary indiscretions including all-you-can-eat buffets. He did
do his PD manually which is how he normally does PD when he
travels (at home uses a machine).
.
In the ED, the patient's vitals were T 100.0, BP 133/72, HR 94,
RR 28, O2sat 87% on RA, 97% on 6L. Labs notable for elevated
white count at 12.5 and 90% neutrophils, troponin T 1.36, CK
173, CKMB 20, MB index 11.6. Blood cultures were sent. He was
given Levofloxacin for possible PNA and Lasix 80mg IV. CXR read
as likely pulmonary edema, consider atypical infection. ECG
unchanged, first degree AV block. He was given aspirin, beta
blocker. Cards consult in ED felt that elevated troponins were
related to demand ischemia with CHF exacerbation in setting of
dietary indiscretion and medication non-compliance.
.
Review of systems on admission is positive for orthopnea,
dyspnea on exertion, PND, LE edema and occasional chest pain. He
also notes dysuria but is unsure if discomfort with urination
began prior to or following placemtn of the urinary catheter.
Negative for fevers, chills.


Past Medical History:
- renal cell carcinoma s/p R nephrectomy [**2103**]

- CAD s/p MI in [**5-4**], bare metal stent to RCA
- hemorrhoids: s/p surgical correction [**8-3**], with subsequent
decrease in BRBPR but still gets on occasion. On surveillence
cscope [**6-3**], noted to have grade 2 internal hemorrhoids
- PVD: chronic symptoms of claudication but yet to undergo
workup

Social History:
He is married. He has 3 kids. He works as a painter. He has
history of chronic smoking at 1.5 packs for 30 years. He quit 5
years ago. He has history of intravenous drug abuse when he was

packs per week for about 5-6 years.

He has 1 sister who is healthy.

Studies:
[**2109-10-4**] Echo: Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2109-4-29**], the findings are similar.
.
[**2109-10-5**] Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The  left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal mid to distal septal hypokinesis (branch
disease?). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly to moderately
thickened. There is a moderate-sized, mobile echodensity on the
aortic valve (0.7 cm mobile echodensity on the LV side of the
non-coronary cusp) suggestive of a vegetation. There is no
significant valvular aortic stenosis (at most trivial). The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased
stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate to severe mitral annular
calcification (involving the chordal structures). There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-10-4**], no
change (aortic valve vegetation was present but not reported.
Mild regional LV hypokinesis was present but not reported).
Reviewing the TTE from [**5-4**], the regional dysfunction and aortic
vegetation are now new.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional LV hypokinesis (overall
