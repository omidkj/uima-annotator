Brief Hospital Course:
1. Food impaction: the patient did not respond to IV reglan
given at admission. He underwent EGD on [**11-19**] which demonstrated
a large food particle in the esophagus that was pushed into the
stomach.  He required intubation for the procedure, but was
easily extubated.  He tolerated a clear liquid diet and was
advanced to a mechanical soft/dysphagia diet. There was a
possible ring identified on EGD.  He will continue on his
outpatient PPI and will follow up with GI in [**11-23**] weeks for
repeat evaluation.  He had a cough following the procedure. CXR
was ordered and preliminary read did not demonstrate evidence of
an infiltrate--final read (available after discharge)indicates
atelectasis and possible aspiration/early infectious process.

2. ESRD: underwent HD on [**2141-11-20**], seen by renal HD/consult
team.

3. CAD/CHF: not currently active. Given low BP on this
admission, BP medications were held with the instruction to
discuss restarting with his outpatient providers--follow up
scheduled for next week.

4. Anticoagulation: supratherapeutic at admission and coumadin
held.  Goal as outpatient 1.8-2.5.  INR 3.1 on day of discharge.
Will have repeat INR drawn at HD to determine timing of
restarting coumadin.

5. h/o VT: outpatient mexiletine

6. Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine

8. Disposition: discharged home following EGD and toleration of
a mechanical/soft diet. Full code.  GI/Cardiology/PCP follow up
in the next 1-2 weeks.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with food impaction in your esophagus and
underwent an upper endoscopy.  You tolerated the procedure well
and were extubated without complication.  You were tolerating a
soft diet and your medications at discharge.

Because your blood pressures were low, we held your blood
pressure medications (Metoprolol and Lisinopril, both on
dialysis and non-dialysis days) while in the hospital and on
discharge. Please re-address restarting these medications with
your primary care physician or your cardiologist (you are
scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2141-12-1**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] on
[**2141-12-6**]).

You will need an outpatient GI evaluation in [**11-23**] weeks following
discharge and likely a repeat EGD. We recommend you continue
with a diet of soft food until you see GI as an outpatient.

Please take your medication as you were prior to admission,
there were no changes. Please resume your prior anticoagulation
with INR checks.

Please seek medical attent
