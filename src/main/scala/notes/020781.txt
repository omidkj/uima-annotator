History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83290**] is a 76 year old female with a PMH significant for
CHF, HTN, DVT with PE s/p IVC filter on coumadin, COPD,
meningioma, dementia, seizure disorder transferred from an OSH
on [**2200-8-5**] for abdominal pain.  She was initially admitted to an
OSH from her nursing home for fever to 101 and a fall.  At the
OSH, trauma work-up including CTH was negative, and the patient
was noted to have a leukocytosis to 14.8 with 12% bands, 76%
PMN, INR 3.5, Tbili 5.3 (direct 3.6), ALP 715. RUQ U/S
demonstrated multiple gallstones, dilated CBD to 19mm.  She was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent ERCP.

Overnight, the patient received 2 units FFP without incident.
She was also felt to be in Afib with RVR by the admitting
hospitalist.  This afternoon, she was receiving an additional 1
unit FFP and 15 minutes into transfusion developed hypoxia 85%
RA, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever to 102.6.
.
The patient subsequently developed an increasing oxygen
requirement requiring intubation. A CXR demonstrated bilateral
pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.

occurred 4 years ago)

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) Study Date of [**2200-8-5**]
10:46 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Intra and extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The distal
CBD is poorly visualized, and a stone within this region is not
excluded. ERCP or MRCP is recommended for further evaluation.
2. Fatty liver. Please note that in the setting of fatty liver,
more
advanced forms of liver disease including cirrhosis and/or
fibrosis cannot be excluded by ultrasound.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence for acute cholecystitis.
4. Right pleural effusion.

CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old female with a PMH signficant for CHF, HTN, DVT with
PE s/p IVC filter on coumadin, COPD, meningioma, dementia,
seizure disorder admitted for choledocholithiasis versus
cholangitis transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory
failure and biliary sepsis.

# Respiratory failure: Patient with baseline CHF with OSH
admission CXR demonstrating pulmonary edema. In setting of
receiving 4 units FFP, likely became volume overloaded leading
to hypoxia.  In addition, new onset atrial fibrillation likely
contributed to development of pulmonary edema.  Initial concern
by hospitalist with regard to immune-mediated transfusion
reaction, although this was felt to be unlikely from transfusion
medicine.

# Biliary sepsis: Sepsis secondary to cholangitis given marked
hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, and RUQ U/S consistent with
CBD dilatation.  OSH blood cultures positive for GNR. Patient
was treated with vanco and amp/sulbactam.  Despite antimicrobial
coverage, she developed sepsis requiring max dose vasopressin,
norepinephrine, and phenylephrine with continued hypotension
unresponsive to IVF or albumin.  She became anuric and developed
an elevated lactate to 10. She underwent two unsuccessful ERCP
procedures with identification of a pancreatic mass invading
into the CBD.  An emergent IR placed PTC was placed.

# Goals of care: Despite aggressive medical and interventional
therapy, the patient developed refractory severe sepsis.  After
repeated and extensive discussions with the patient's
daughter/HCP, the patient was transitioned to comfort measures
only. All medications except for those for comfort were held and
she was terminally extubated.  She expired peacefully shortly
thereafter.
