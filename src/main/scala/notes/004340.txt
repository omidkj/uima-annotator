Pertinent Results:
cxr [**8-2**]
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There are bilateral
perihilar
consolidations, left greater than right, with air bronchograms.
Scattered
airspace opacities are also seen at the right apex, and left
base. There is no
definite pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
There is no
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral perihilar consolidations, and scattered
additional
airspace opacities, most consistent with multifocal pneumonia vs
other
etiologies.


Video swallow [**8-4**]
VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION: In collaboration with
speech and
pathology department, a speech and swallow evaluation was
performed. Barium
of various consistencies was administered to the patient during
continuous
videofluoroscopic imaging.

ORAL PHASE: Bolus formation and AP tongue movements are within
normal limits.
There is a mild amount of premature spillover seen before the
swallow.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: A mild delay in pharyngeal swallow initiation
is seen.
Palatal elevation, laryngeal elevation, and epiglottic
deflection are within
functional limits. However, laryngeal valve closure was mildly
reduced. A
trace amount of residue is seen within the vallecula and
piriform sinuses. 13-
mm barium tablet passes freely to the stomach.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Penetration was seen with thin and
nectar-thick
liquids, secondary to premature spillover and swallow delay.
Aspiration of
thin liquids was also seen, and was noted to be silent.

IMPRESSION: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia, with penetration and
an episode of
aspiration seen. For further details, please refer to speech and
pathology
report from the same day.




Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and taken to the SICU for hypoxia requiring
continuous O2 sat monitioring and 100% non-rebreather. Kept NPO
for suspetced aspiration PNA. Hydrated and placed on broad
spectrum IVAB unasyn and vanco pending sputum culture.
Speech and swallow pathology was re- consulted and a video
swallow was perform - see results section- essentially-exam
unchnaged from previous intermittent,trace aspiration and
aspiration was eliminated with thickened liquids and the chin
tuck. He is admittedly not 100% compliant at home w/ his
swallowing precautions. With aggressive pul tiolet and IVAB, his
oxygenation improved and was transferred from the ICU to the
general floor. IVAB were changed to augmentin and bactrim per ID
recommendations- sputum cultures were contaminated and therefore
unrevealing.
ON HD# 5 pt developed abd discomfort and distention. A KUB was
done and showed large amounts of stool. After bowel regimen was
increased, pt passed stool and symptoms improved and was [**Last Name (un) 1815**]
reg diet. On HD#7 developed left sided back pain w/ coughing
which was reproduceable w/ palpation. Appears to be muscle
strain from coughing. Given toradol and placed on motrin regimen
w/ some relief.
