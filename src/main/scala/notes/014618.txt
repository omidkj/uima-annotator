s/p mechanical fall

None


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 97837**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with h/o HTN, severe
osteoarthritis, and L eye blindness who presents after a
mechanical fall. Patient describes getting up yesterday at 5pm
to walk into her kitchen with her walker. She accidently took
one hand off the walker and lost her balance. She started to
fall and leaned against the kitchen counter and lowered herself
to the ground. She denied any dizziness, nausea, shortness of
breath, or chest pain associated with the fall. Once she was on
the ground she could not get back up. She was afraid that she
would hurt herself if she tried to get back up and fell again.
She activated her Lifeline but there was no response. The
following morning maintenance personnel entered her apartment to
examine her new windows and found her on the floor. She denied
losing consciousness or having any significant pain. An
ambulance was called and patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**]
Emergency Department.
.
On presentation to the Emergency Department vital signs were T
93.8 SBP 175/90 HR 78 RR 18 SpO2 100% RA. She underwent CT scan
of her head and spine to assess for any injuries. Imaging
studies were negative. She admitted to lower back pain and was
given morphine 2 mg IV. An EKG was performed which showed ST
elevations in V3-V4. Repeat EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V4.
She denied any cardiac symptoms. She was started on heparin gtt
and received aspirin 325 mg, plavix 600 mg, and lopressor 5 mg
IV. Cardiology was consulted. Bedside echo was performed showing
apical akinesis. Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service for
further evaluation.
.
On arrival to the floor patient's hypothermia had resolved. She
denied any compliants---no cp, sob, headache, back pain,
weakness. She denies any history of seizure, stroke, blood clot,
heart disease, lung disease. She does admit to having more
frequent falls recently. She is reliant on a walker for mobility
and does not leave the facility without assistance. She does not
endorse claudication, lightheadedness, or vertigo as
contributors to her recent falls. She states that they occur
because she gets off balance and is too weak to catch herself.

Reports/Imaging
TTE [**3-6**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to
extensive apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is severe mitral annular
calcification; trace mitral regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

TTE [**3-7**]:
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with distal LV/apical akinesis suggested. The remaining segments
are hyperdynamic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral regurgitation
is present but cannot be quantified. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-3-6**], LV
systolic function is more vigorous (inotrope effect?).

CT Head [**3-6**]:
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

CT C-spine [**3-6**]:
1. No significant interval change from the previous study. No
acute fracture or dislocation.
2. Moderate-to-severe cervical spondylosis with unchanged
anterolisthesis at several levels. If there is acute clinical
concern for spinal cord injury then MRI is recommended for
further evaluation.

CXR [**3-7**]:
No acute intrathoracic pathology including no pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially received lisinopril 20mg
PO qday and metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. However, after the am
doses, her BP dropped as low as 70/45, although she was
aymptomatic. The BP improved with 1.5L IVF, Trendelenberg, and
dopamine gtt. No new murmurs on exam and repeat echo did not
show any mechanical complications, but a hyperdynamic LV which
may be consistent with pressors and leading to outflow
obstruction. Her antihypertensive medications were held, and
dopamine was changed to phenylephrine to decrease LV outflow
obstruction due to apical hypok
