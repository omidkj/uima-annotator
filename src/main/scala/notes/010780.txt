Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
68 yo f w/ HIV (cd4 209, VL undetectable earlier this month),
ESRD on HD, CAD s/p IMI w/ 2 LCX stents, CHF, COPD, DMII, h/o
eosinophilic PNA [**4-22**], who p/w sudden onset of SOB while sitting
in bed, 1 night PTA.  Accompanied by R sided CP, worse w/
inspiration. reports dry cough, unchanged X many months.  +subj
fevers/chills X1 day. no LE edema/ urinary changes/sore throat/
photophobia/ orthopnea. Pt was recently admitted on [**9-28**] with
chest pain and SOB, which was ultimately attributed to recurrent
eosinophilic PNA, as her prior steroid course was too short. At
that time she was d/c'ed on 9 month taper starting at 40mg per
day. She was currently taking 20mg of prednisone per day prior
to admission.

In ED, f102, hr 118, bp 104/59, r28, 100%NRB. Rec'd levofloxacin
300mg IV, vancomycin 1g.  BP decreased to 75 systolic, but
increased w/ 500cc bolus of NS.
Transfered to MICU and treated with prednisone, 30mg each day,
and azithromycin/ceftriazone to cover ? eosinophilic PNA vs CAP,
respectively. She notes resolution of SOB and Chest pain. still
c/o dry cough- at baseline. tolerating PO's without residual
n/v. Transfered to floor for further treatment of PNA.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68 yo f w/ HIV, CAD, CHF, CRF who p/w acute onset SOB,
febrile on presentation w/ intermittent hypotension in ED, elev
WBCC, lactate, w/ RUL peripheral opacity, no ECG changes.

1) SOB- RUL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia (CAP vs
eosinophilic vs atypical) vs PE.  Elev WBCC and story most c/w
pneumococcal PNA.   Given hx and low clinical probability of as
well as alternative diagnosis, [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] criteria low.  Also PE not
c/w intermittent hypotension responsive to volume presentation.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been on prednisone taper for eosinophilic
pneumonia in [**Month (only) 547**](mult recurrences, most recent in [**Month (only) **])
and was down to to 20 qd prior to admission.  Rec'd solumedrol
in ED.  IN [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was treated with azithromycin and
ceftriaxone to cover CAP(will hold on vanc and levo for now),
prednisone 30mg each day (for possible eosinophilic PNA),
ipratroprium/albuterol nebs. On transfer to floor, still unclear
etiology of RUL consolidation - most likely CAP vs eosinophilic
PNA. No peripheral eosinophils at this time, which could be due
to the fact that she has been partially tx with steroids and now
she was rebounding as steroids continued to be taperred. Less
likely to be OI (such as PCP/nocardia) given that repeat CD4
during admission was>800. Repeat PA/lat on [**11-15**] showed
resolving RUL infiltrate. Ms [**Known lastname **] also had improved clinically
by HD #4, reported no SOB and minimally R sided pleuritic chest
pain. She was discharged on 14 day course of levofloxacin and
30mg of steroids to be tappered slowly by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over the
next many months.
2) Hypotension - On admission, concerned about sepsis as Ms.
[**Known lastname **] presented with  elev lactate (3.0-->4.3-->1.6) and anion
gap (22) c/w possible infection resulting in mild sepsis.
Anti-hypertension meds held on admit and she responded well to
1L fluid challenge. Hemodynamically stable throughout rest of
admission. Lactate trended towards nml. No pressors needed.
Blood cx with no growth at time of discharge. SBP b/w 100-130
and ace and bblocker restarted prior to discharge. Per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], BP tend to run in 100's after dialysis, but Ms. [**Known lastname **]
often gets worsening of CHF and chest pain when off HTN
medications. As discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], did not restart
imdur on d/c but will restart at f/u appt.
3) [**Name (NI) **] pt on stable HAART regimen.  No evidence of infection.
CD4 on [**11-14**]: 986; suggest f/u counts as outpt when current
episode of infection resolves.

4) DMII- Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with anion gap, most likely [**2-19**] to
uremia, but component of uncontrolled blood sugars could not be
excluded. Was on insulin drip in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with BG well controlled in
low 100's. On transfer to floor, she was restarted on outpt 8
units of NPH in am and cover with RISS. However, BG levels
occasionally jump to levels >300 and NPH was increased to 12
units in AM. Additionally, Ms. [**Known lastname **] follows sliding scale at
home, which was continued on discharge.

5) ESRD- Ms. [**Known lastname **] has baseline oliguria.
