History of Present Illness:
79M w/ CAD, AS, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia p/w acute onset
bilateral shoulder pain occuring at rest, radiating down the
arms, associated w/ SOB and mild diaphoresis. Notably, the
patient has had subacute crescendo angina over the course of
weeks to months refractory to SL nitro, prompting use of a nitro
patch at night. He sleeps sitting upright in a chair due to
orthopnea. He notes intermittent LE swelling. He has had a week
h/o URI symptoms, dry cough, and occasional chills. The
patient's wife notes that he had LOC and a fall 1 month ago. He
has not had fever, abdominal pain, or N/V/D. He has not had sick
contacts or recent travel.
He presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] where BP 144/75 HR 79 RR 20 O2sat 95%
RA. EKG showed diffuse 2-[**Street Address(2) 79078**] depressions. He
was given plavix 600 mg, heparin gtt, and nitro gtt prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. In our ED, T 98.8 HR 71 BP 118/56 RR 22 O2sat
99% RA. EKG showed resolution of STD in II,III,F (c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 620**]
EKG), <1 mm STE in V1-V2, and persistent >1 mm STD in V4-V5. He
was started on nitro gtt for persistent CP and heparin gtt,
which was d/c'd when noted to be guaiac positive. He was
transferred to the floor for further evaluation. He is currently
pain-free off nitro. Ruled in for NSTEMI.

II,F,V3, <2 mm STD V4-V5; QTc 453 ms
[**10-6**] Echo: Pre-CPB: The left atrium and right atrium are normal
in cavity size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No left
ventricular aneurysm is seen. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF approximately 30-35%.
. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The
remaining left ventricular segments contract normally. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
stenosis. ([**Location (un) 109**]~ 0.8-0.9 cm2) Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. POSTBYPASS: The pt is
receiving an infusion of milrinone at 0.15 uck/kg/min and
norepinephrine at 0.08 ucg/kg/min. There is preserved RV
systolic. LV systolic function is mildly improved in the setting
of inotropes (Walls that contact[**Name (NI) **] well prebypass are more
hyperdynamic/walls that were hypokinetic remain hypokinetic)
There is a well seated bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
There is a perivalvular AI jet originating in the area outside
and between the left and right coronary cusps of the prosthesis.
The AI is moderate (2+) in quantity. The remaining study is
unchanged from prebypass.
[**10-2**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system
demonstrated 3-vessel disease. The LMCA is short and heavily
calcified. The LAD is totally occluded proximally. There is
collateral flow from left to left and right to left. The LCX is
non-dominant with a discrete 90% OM2 lesion. The RCA is a
dominant vessel with an 80% lesion at the origin and is heavily
calcified. There are robust right to left collaterals. 2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a systolic arterial blood pressure
of 133/62 mmHg.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   79 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   evaluate effusions
Final Report
SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST [**2180-10-19**]

HISTORY: 79-year-old man, status post CABG; evaluate effusions.

FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "supine at 7:25
a.m." is
compared with upright studies obtained the preceding day. The
patient is
status post recent CABG with midline surgical staples in situ
and intact
sternal cerclage wires. Allowing for the positioning, the
overall appearance
is not much changed. There is persistent LV enlargement without
vascular
congestion and only small bilateral pleural effusions. There is
right more
than left basilar subsegmental atelectasis, with no other
airspace process.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta is
redemonstrated.

IMPRESSION: Status post recent CABG without CHF or significant
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to an OSH with a
NSTEMI. He was medically managed and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care. On [**10-5**] he underwent a cardiac cath which revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis. On
[**10-6**] he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Remained on Levophed, milrinone, and
vasopressin drips which were slowly weaned over a few days.
Within 25 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day four chest
tubes were removed. Bedside swallowing eval. performed on
post-op day five as he had some dysphagia with emesis along with
altered mental status. He slowly developed worsening pulmonary
edema despite aggressively pulmonary toilet. He required a right
thoracentesis for an effusion on post-op day twelve. He also had
thoracentesis on the left and his respiratory status improved.
He was intermittently on BIPAP at night and no longer requires
this.  His mental status and respiratory status improved and he
was discharged to rehab in stable condition on POD#15.
