CXR [**11-21**]: Comparison is made to the prior chest radiograph
performed six hours earlier, as well as the chest CT. There has
been worsening of the area of consolidation with air-fluid
levels within the right upper lobe. This is consistent with
suspected empyema following right upper lobe resection. There
has been placement of endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 7 cm
above the carina, appropriately sited. The side port of
nasogastric tube is above the gastroesophageal junction and this
could be advanced 5-10 cm for optimal placement. The right lung
is relatively clear.
CT chest 11/12:1. Status post chest tube removal with increased
fluid accumulation in the right anterior and superior pleural
spaces in the post-surgical cavity. The presence of locules of
air is concerning for infection. A bronchopleural fistual cannot
excluded.
2. Persistent right middle lobe collapse with obliteration of
the right middle lobe bronchus. Evaluation for torsion is
limited but the configuration of the collapsed right middle lobe
appears similar to the prior examination where there was not
evidence for torsion.
3. Improved aeration of the right and left lower lobes.
4. Moderate-to-severe emphysema, stable.
CXR 11/13:2 right chest tubes in place. Suture line s/p right
upper lobectomy is seen, apical hydropneumothorax remains.SQ gas
is post operative. Left lung clear
CXR [**11-23**]: Unchanged appearance of the mild right apical
hydropneumothorax
CXR [**11-24**]: Moderate volume right apical pneumothorax is
unchanged. New opacification in the right mid lung could be
atelectasis, pneumonia, or hemorrhage. Only a small volume of
right pleural effusion, if any, remains. Two apical and one
basal pleural drain are still in place. Small left pleural
effusion and moderate left basal atelectasis are more
pronounced.
CXR [**11-26**]: 1. Unchanged right pneumothorax since removal of
basilar chest tube. No evidence of tension.
2. Slight worsening of left basilar atelectasis and small
effusion.
CXR [**2172-11-30**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-28**], the right chest
tube has
been removed. There is progressive decrease in the pleural air
collection in the upper zone. The left lung remains essentially
clear.
On the lateral view, there is an air-fluid level anteriorly at
the
mid-to-lower zone, consistent with small loculated
hydropneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on
[**2172-11-21**] and had 1. Right thoracotomy 2. Decortication of lung
and 3. Completion right middle lobectomy.
There were no complications during the procedure and the patient
tolerated the procedures well overall. Post op he was
transferred to the unit for close monitoring.

On [**11-6**] he underwent a successful RU lobectomy via thoracotomy
for for Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer. Then on [**11-21**] he
was admitted to ICU. Non-con chest CT was suspicious for
empyema. He was intubated for bronchoscopy, which was largely
unrevealing. He became hypotensive while on propofol, initially
responded to fluid bolus but did require phenylephrine. An
a-line was attempted without success. OG tube put out 450 mL
overnight, looked like old blood. The next day he went to OR for
redo thoracotomy, RML lobectomy and washout, received 2500 IVF
and 2 u PRBC. He was extubated post-op in OR. He had stridors
initially that resolved
