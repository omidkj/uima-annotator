CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval effusion, ? pneumothorax- please do this study at
11 am

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old woman s/p removal of left sided chest tube today
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval effusion, ? pneumothorax- please do this study at 11 am
INDICATION: 74-year-old female status post removal of left-sided
chest tube.

COMPARISON: [**2150-2-12**].

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged
position. There has been interval removal of the left-sided
chest tube. There is no recurrent or residual pneumothorax. The
remainder of the examination is little changed with no
significant improvement in the degree of moderate pulmonary
edema, bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pneumothorax.
2. Moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
effusions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: re-evaluate left pleural effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
re-evaluate left pleural effusion
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 74-year-old female for re-evaluation of left pleural
effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2154-1-23**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial imaging of the chest without
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were
obtained and reviewed.

FINDINGS: Left PICC remains in place, tip in the upper right
atrium. Evidence of prior coronary artery bypass grafting is
unchanged, with sternotomy wires, unchanged sternal dehiscence,
and densely calcified native coronary arteries. Moderate
cardiomegaly is unchanged. Multiple prominent mediastinal and
hilar lymph nodes are unchanged. Tracheostomy tube remains in
place, approximately 5 cm above the carina. Left chest tube
remains in place, with tip positioned medially near the apex.
New drainage catheter is in place at the left lung base, and the
small left pleural effusion is slightly decreased in size, with
small foci of gas now seen within the effusion . Small right
pleural effusion is little changed.

Diffuse ground-glass opacity throughout both lungs, along with
small centrilobular nodules, and mild apical predominant
interlobular septal thickening is again noted, slightly improved
since prior exam.

Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly decreased size of small left pleural effusion, with
new left basilar chest tube in place, and second old left chest
tube unchanged in position medially near the left apex.
2. Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
3. Slightly improved appearance of diffuse ground-glass opacity,
small centrilobular nodules, and apical predominant interlobular
septal thickening. This could represent improvement in pulmonary
edema, infectious process, or both.

(10-20mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.


MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.

Conclusions
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. LV systolic
function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection
fraction 30 percent). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. The
