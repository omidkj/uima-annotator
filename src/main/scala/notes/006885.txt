Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for abdominal pain on [**2165-8-18**].  During
his ED evaluation, patient became hypotensive and was oliguric.
On insertion of NG tube, bright red blood was levaged. He was
emergently intubated. After stabilization, CT scan of his
abdomen demonstrated pneumoperitoneum, likely from bowel
perforation.

Given the grave situation, the patient was taken emergently to
the operating room on [**2165-8-18**], where he had the following
procedures:
1. Exploratory laparotomy,
2. Repair of proximal ileo-small bowel perforation,
3. Distal jejunal to cecal bypass
4. Open cholecystectomy.

Postoperatively, patient was then transferred to the ICU for
further care. A central venous line and an A-line were placed,
and Levophed was started for BP support. Patient received broad
spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl). Blood
cultures eventually grew back Bacteroides and Clostridium. He
was started on TPN on POD 1.

GI service was consulted to assist with preop GI bleeding.
Because the NG output became non-bloody preoperatively and
patient did not have evidence of further bleeding, endoscopy was
deferred. For Crohn's disease, patient was started on
hydrocortisone 100 mg TID, which was slowed tapered. He was
extubated on POD#1 and weaned off pressor support.

On the morning of POD 2, patient exhibited symptoms of CVA, with
L hemiparesis and aphasia.  At that time, he was able to move
his right side.  The stroke service was consulted, but patient
was not a candidate for TPA given recent surgery. Supportive
measures were taken to allow autoregulation of BP. Later that
day, he became unable to move the right side of his body.  His
respiratory status continued to decline and he was intubated.
An MRI showed multiple areas of slow diffusion in the deep white
matter of both frontal lobes, left parietal and left occipital
lobe, suggesting acute watershed infarction.  A TTE was negaive
for thrombus.  A carotid US showed significant plaque with a
right 80-99% and a left 60-69% carotid stenosis.  Lepirudin drip
was started since his HIT panel was pending.  On POD 4, he was
transitioned to a heparin drip as HIT panel was negative.
Patient required Neosynepherine to keep his SBP > 140.  By POD
6, patient was stable, intubated, following commands on his
left.  He was extubated later that day.

On POD 6, patient was found to have rising WBC, peaking at 39K
on POD 7. He rapidly improved with vasopressor support and
continued broad spectrum antibiotics. CT of the abdomen showed
free fluid as well as thickened SB and LB. Vancomycin po was
given prophylactically.

On POD10 ([**2165-8-29**]), increased drainage from the abdominal wound
was noted. Patient was taken to the OR for dehiscence and
underwent the following procedures:

1) Exploratory laparotomy
2) Emergent repair of abdominal wall dehiscence
3) Insertion of gastrojejunal feeding system (MIC) via open
gastrotomy with a jejunal feeding component

Patient recovered from this procedure well. After diuresis and
extubation, patient was transferred to floor on POD 16/6. On POD
18/8 ([**9-6**]), patient had a witnessed PEA arrest. He was
resuscitated according to ACLS protocol and returned to ICU.
STAT echocardiogram showed preserved LV function but decreased
RV function, with dilated RA. There was no evidence of
tamponade. Lower extremity US showed no evidence of DVT. Given a
possible PE based on echocardiogram, heparin gtt was initiated.
On the following day, an IVC filter was placed ([**9-7**]). Patient
recovered rapidly without further neurologic deficit. CT done on
POD 21/11/2 ([**9-9**]) showed no evidence of residual PE, but a new
multi-loculated, wall-enhancing intraabdominal fluid collection
with extravasation of contrast, suggesting an anastomotic leak.
Because the patient's comorbidity, US guided drainage of the
intraabdominal abscess was performed. Culture eventually grew
out VRE, Staph coag negative and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans. Antibiotics
were adjusted accordingly, to include daptomycin, zosyn, flagyl
and caspofungin.

In efforts to wean the patient from the vent, bronchoscopy and L
thoracentesis was performed on POD 22/12/3. A follow-up CT on
POD 25/15/6 ([**9-13**]) showed persistent anastomotic leak; however,
at the time, patient was clinically well, off pressors and
hemodynamically stable. After much discussion with the family of
patient's comorbidities and risk of complications should he
undergo another operation, it was decided not to pursue a third
operation. The following day ([**9-14**]), patient's abdomen became
more distended. His condition deteriorated, with increasing
fluid and pressor requirement. After further discussion,
patient's family approved DNR/DNI order. Patient expired on
[**2165-9-15**].
