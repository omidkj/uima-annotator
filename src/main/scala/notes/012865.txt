admitted to the hospital on [**4-9**] and underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting x 3 by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with a LIMA to
the LAD, a vein graft to the ramus, and vein graft to the
PDA. He was transferred to the cardiothoracic ICU in stable
condition, A paced, on a propofol drip at 20 mcg/kg/min, and
a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.3 mcg/kg/min.

On postoperative day 1, the patient had been extubated the
evening prior. He was in a sinus rhythm at 87 with a blood
pressure of 96/49. He was hemodynamically stable with a great
blood gas, saturating 99% on 2 liters. He was alert and
oriented. In no apparent distress. His lungs were clear. His
heart was regular in rate and rhythm. His incision was clean,
dry, and intact. He had trace peripheral edema. Postoperative
labs included a white count of 15.8, a hematocrit of 28.1,
and a platelet count of 315,000. K of 4.5, a BUN of 17, a
creatinine of 0.7. His chest x-ray showed a small left
pleural effusion. He remained on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1
mcg/kg/min. He was started on Plavix again in lieu of aspirin
as he had a known aspirin allergy. His Neo-Synephrine was
weaned over the course of the day with a plan to start beta
blockade and Lasix diuresis later in the day. His Swan-Ganz
was removed. His chest tubes were removed, and he was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Two.

He was seen and evaluated by Case Management on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Two and
was switched over to p.o. Percocet for pain management. He
was also given diltiazem for blood pressure control and was
seen and evaluated by physical therapy.

On postoperative day 2, he remained hemodynamically stable.
He was alert and oriented. His sternum was stable. His
incisions were clean, dry, and intact. He continued with
Lasix diuresis. He was placed on diltiazem at 60 mg 4 times a
day. A repeat chest x-ray was done. His pacing wires were
removed, and he continued with Lasix diuresis.

On postoperative day 3, he continued to make excellent
progress. His hematocrit was stable at 24.5, with a white
count of 10.5, a BUN of 14, a creatinine of 0.8. He was
saturating 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula, in sinus rhythm at
91, with a blood pressure of 124/60. He had been restarted on
his Advair and albuterol p.r.n. and restarted on his
cholesterol agents postoperatively. He had some rales at the
bases. His exam was otherwise unremarkable. His Lasix was
increased slightly. He was given 2 grams of magnesium for
repletion, and he was encouraged to ambulate with a plan for
discharge 1 to 2 days hence. He continued to work with the
nurses and physical therapists. He was switched over to
Percocet for p.o. pain management and continued to make
excellent progress. He was also covered by sliding-scale
insulin for elevated blood sugars at that time.

On postoperative day 4, he did have 1 episode of vomiting. He
also some postoperative constipation. He was given Milk of
Magnesia and continued with his Colace. He was
hemodynamically stable. He also had been started on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
this was monitored. His abdomen was soft and nontender with
slight distention. His extremities were warm and well
perfused. He epicardial pacing wires had already been
removed.

On postoperative day 5, the date of discharge, he had no
events overnight. He was hemodynamically stable, saturating
96% on room air. His creatinine was stable at 0.7. His K was
3.8. He was doing much better; in fact was deemed ready for
discharge. He was repleted once again for potassium and
magnesium and was planned for discharge; for him to be
discharged home after he completed his work with physical
therapy that day. He had no further nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea.
