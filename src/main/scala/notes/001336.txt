History of Present Illness:
History: From Daughter, served as interpreter
PCP: [**Name Initial (NameIs) 65249**]

70 y.o. female with COPD on 4L home O2 and BiPAP, CHF (s/p ICD),
CAD s/p CABG, HTN, presents with dyspnea and hypercarbic
respiratory distress.   She was in her USOH (sleeping in a
reclining chair, with DOE at 10 feet) until 1 week ago when she
stopped wearing her BiPAP.  Her daughter notes that she became
gradually fatigued over the past week.  Three days prior to
admission her daughter noted that she was more short of breath
and called her in the middle of the night complaining of dyspnea
on each of the nights prior to admission.  On the morning of
admission the patient was even more dyspneic and called her
daughter, who was out of the house.  The patient then pressed
her life alert button and activated EMS.

In the ER she was found to be hypercarbic with 7.27/93/76.
SBP:140s, HR:70s.  CXR with pulmonary Edema.  She was given 80
mg IV lasix, neb treatment, Solumedrol 125 x 1 and Levofloxacin
500 mg IV x 1.   She was admitted to the MICU with hypercarbic
respiratory failure and CHF.

ROS:
POSITIVE: non-compliant with low Na diet, +PND over the last 3
days, DOE with walking 10 feet, mild wheezing.
NEGATIVE: fevers, wt change, CP, Palp, Edema, ABD pain,
weakness, numbness, change in urination, dysuria.

Past Medical History:
1) CAD s/p 4-vessel CABG in [**2119**]
2) CHF with EF 40% by echo at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2128-8-25**] with
mild TR, mild Pulm HTN (38mm Hg)
3) DM Type 2
4) HTN
5) COPD on home O2, BIPAP with multiple past admissions for
non-compliance with BiPAP and pCO2 in the 70-80 range
6) Schizophrenia
7) L3 fracture in [**2127**]
8) Runs of symptomatic VT s/p ICD in [**1-2**]

Social History:
Do not Intubate.  Lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility.
Persian-speaking only.  Former home maker.  70 pack year
history, quit in [**2098**].  No EtOH.  Uses a walker or cane to
ambulate.  Can only take 10 steps prior to having severe
dyspnea.  Her daughter cooks her meals for her.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2129-1-7**] CXR - Congestive heart failure with perihilar and
interstitial edema as well as small pleural effusions
[**2129-1-9**] CXR - Again seen is an ICD with lead terminating in the
right ventricle.  There continues to be a hazy bilateral
vasculature with pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent
with fluid overload/CHF.  Compared to the film from the prior
day, there has been no significant change
[**2129-1-10**] ECHO - The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal
anteroseptal and apical hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a
loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
[**2129-1-11**] CXR - Improved opacity within the right lung base,
likely due to resolving atelectasis.  Otherwise unchanged since
