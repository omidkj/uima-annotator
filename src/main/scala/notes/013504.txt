EKG demonstrated STE in II III aVF
.
CARDIAC CATH:1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two
(2) vessel coronary artery disease.  The right coronary artery
was diffusely
diseased with a total occlusion in the mid-distal portion of the
vessel without any flow.  The left main demonstrated no flow
limiting lesions. The left anterior descending artery
demonstrated a 30% proximal lesion along with a widely patent
stent in the mid portion of the vessel.  The left circumflex
demonstrated demonstrated mild luminal irregularities
throughout.
2.  Limited hemodynamics demonstrated low central aortic
pressure
(100/70 mm Hg) while on dopamine gtt.  The rhythm throughout the
case
was atrial fibrillation with occasional pacing from her
pacemaker.
3.  Successful PTCA, thrombectomy and stenting of the mid-distal
RCA
with a Vision (3x18mm) bare metal stent. Final angiography
demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no
residual stenosis and TIMI II flow throughout the vessel (See
PTCA comments). FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Successful PTCA,
thrombectomy and stenting of the mid-distal RCA with a bare
metal stent.
.
TTE:The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate to severe
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
segments. The other segments have hyperdynamic function. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with inferior
infarction/ischemia. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation
with poor leaflet apposition. This may be due to ischemic
papillary muscle dysfunction or possible partial flail of the
mitral leaflet. At least mild aortic stenosis. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
If clinically indicated, a TEE may better define mitral valve
pathology.
.
TEE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left or right atrium. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%)
with inferolateral hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately-to-severely thickened/deformed. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. IABP seen in
the descending aorta. IMPRESSION: Thickened mitral valve
leaflets with moderate (+2) MR. Posterior mitral leaflet
appeared teathered, likely secondary to ischemia. No mitral
leaflet flail seen. Severely thickened aortic valve leaflets
with moderate aortic stenosis. IABP seen in the descending
aorta. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at the end
of study. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2154-3-13**], the mitral valve is more clearly seen. The anterior
leaflet appears thickened and does not properly appose with the
posterior leaflet, likely due to ischemic dysfunction of the
postero-medial papillary muscle. The aortic valve stenosis
appears moderate on the current study.
.
Renal US:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Simple renal cysts bilaterally.
3. Arterial and venous flow documented in each renal hilum, but
overall this
is a very limited Doppler examination and no further assessment
can be made.
.
Lower extremity ultrasound: 1. No evidence of arterial occlusion
or throm
