[**2-3**] CXR

IMPRESSION: Elevated central venous pressure as noted on
multiple prior
examinations. However there is suggestion of a hazy opacity in
the lateral
left lung and air bronchograms in the retrocardiac left lung
which may
indicate an underlying pneumonia. Close interval followup
radiographs during therapy recommended to assess for resolution.


[**2-5**] CXR

FINDINGS: The left hemithorax is now quite opaque with small
residual of
partially aerated lung in the left upper field. Numerous
branching
calcifications in the left hemithorax are consistent with
calcified bronchi.  The density of the left hemithorax can also
have a contribution from either atelectasis or pneumonia.
Correlation with a CT scan is recommended.

[**2-5**] CT CHEST
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate left pleural effusion with collapse of the left lung
with only
minimal aeration of the left apex. Debris within the left main
stem bronchus,
extending primarily into the left lower lobe segmental bronchi
is identified
and could be consistent with mucus plugging.
2. Small to moderate right pleural effusion.
3. Ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening
and mild
cardiomegaly, likely represents fluid overload with possible
superimposed
infection, most prominent in the right middle lobe.
4. Calcification in right breast tissue, stable.
5. Small hiatal hernia.

[**2-6**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-6**], 4:17 a.m. and 1:40
p.m.:

Left upper lobe is re-expanded, lower lobe remains collapsed and
there is at least a moderate left pleural effusion. Borderline
interstitial edema present on the right and along with
persistent mild-to-moderate pleural effusion.  Heart is
moderately enlarged. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard
placement.




Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 84yo F with a history of traumatic SAH ([**12-6**]), AF,
CVA (99'), CAD who presents with cough, fever and hypoxia.

# Hypoxia: Given history of fever, cough, recent hospital
course/rehab course, ? of infiltrate on CXR, initial etiologies
included HAP, CAP and viral etiologies.  The patient initially
received vancomycin and levaquin in the ED.  On arrival to the
MICU the patient was tachypneic to the 40s with O2sats in the
90s on a NRB. She was in AF with RVR to 130s.  She was switched
to two days of vancomycin and zosyn given h/o aspiration in the
past as well as NH/rehab stay.  Pt was ruled out for ACS with
negative CEs and non-ischemic EKGs.  Her respiratory status
improved on diltiazem 60mg QID PO and was weaned down on her O2
requirements.  Her digoxin was also increased to 125 mcg every
other day alternating with 250 mcg every other day.  Her
outpatient metoprolol was stopped as she was well controlled
with diltiazem.  Pt was ready to be called-out to the floor on
[**2-5**] and then had an acute desaturation.  CXR showed complete
atelectasis of the L lung.  CT scan showed bilateral effusions
as well as left-sided atelectasis.  On [**2-6**] pt was intubated for
bronchoscopy and had copious secretions cleared from the L main
stem bronchus.  Repeat CXR showed marked improvement in
atelectasis.  Cultures did not reveal any infectious organisms.
Pt was extubated on [**2-7**].  It is believed that her hypoxia is due
to an acute congestive heart failure exacerbation.  She was
gently diuresed and her oxygen requirement slowly decreased.
Her outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], evaluated her and
recommended starting lisinopril 5 mg daily and acetazolamide 250
mg [**Hospital1 **].  She was also discharged on 40 mg of lasix daily for
continued diuresis.  She will need to have daily weights, oxygen
saturations, and her creatintine checked every 3 days while at
rehab.

# UTI: She had an initial U/A concerning for UTI but urine
culture was negative.  Pt would have been covered by the initial
treatment with vancomycin and zosyn.  Later in her hospital
course she had a U/A with > 50 WBC so she was empirically
treated with ciprofloxacin, however her urine culture grew out
Psuedomonas resistant to ciprofloxacin.  She was started on
ceftazidime and had a midline placed and will need to complete a
7 day course for treatment of her UTI (day 1 [**2-13**]).

# CAD: Chest pain free on presentation, but pt is an elderly,
diabetic female.  Pt was ruled out with negative CEs and
non-ischemic EKG.  Pt remained on an aspirin, statin and
digoxin.

# DM: Metformin and glyburide were held as an inpatient. FSBS
were monitored and pt was placed on SSI.  Her metformin and
glyburide were restarted prior to discharge.

# AF: Pt initially required multiple boluses of IV diltiazem for
better rate c
