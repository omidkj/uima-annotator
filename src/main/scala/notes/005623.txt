SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has two

tobacco or intravenous drug use.  He does have "a couple of
beers" a month.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother has coronary artery
disease and diabetes.  His father has prostate cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
temperature was 100.9, his pulse was 92, his blood pressure
was 96/62, his respiratory rate was 28, and his oxygen
saturation was 92% on room air.  In general, he was obese and
flushed.  He was lying in bed in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the sclerae
were anicteric.  The mucous membranes were moist.  The
oropharynx was clear.  The pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The neck was supple.  There was no
lymphadenopathy.  The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart
sounds.  There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The
abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No
appreciable organomegaly.  There were positive bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed his right great toe was
swollen, warm, and erythematous with a dorsal ulceration over
the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints with
yellow changes.  He had well demarcated erythema extending to
the dorsum of the ankle with separately demarcated erythema
of the lower calf within previously drawn lines.  The
extremities were warm and well perfused.  Dorsalis pedis
pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  Sensation was diminished but
intact.  The left hip was without erythema or warmth but was
painful with passive and active flexion and extension.  There
was no knee involvement.  On neurologic examination, cranial
nerves were within normal limits.  The patient was alert and
oriented times three.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Please refer to
the hospitalization course.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had fevers with
rigors secondary to left toe cellulitis and osteomyelitis.
Blood cultures grew out methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus bacteremia, and it subsequently seeded his left hip
joint (the patient has had total hip replacement on that
side).

The patient underwent incision and drainage of the left hip
and also a left great toe amputation.  The patient was
initially maintained on broad-spectrum antibiotics which were
tailored to oxacillin once sensitivities returned on the
blood cultures.

Infectious Disease was following the patient, and he may be
started on rifampin once his white blood cell count declines
and is afebrile.  The patient will need six weeks of
intravenous oxacillin plus/minus rifampin and six to nine
months of by mouth antibiotics afterwards.

 2.  LEUKOCYTOSIS ISSUES:  The patient had an increase in his
white blood cells on [**6-16**] with white blood cells in his
urine suggestive of a urinary tract infection.  Thus, he was
started on seven days of levofloxacin and his indwelling
Foley catheter was discontinued.

The patient's great toe, status post amputation, looked and
uninfected.  His hip also appeared uninfected with staples
intact and clean, dry, and intact.  Additionally, at this
time, no infiltrates were seen on chest x-ray.

 3.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
sotalol and lisinopril with good blood pressure control.

 4.  QUESTION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient has
a history of atrial fibrillation; although, he was not
currently in atrial fibrillation during this hospitalization
course.  The patient was rate controlled on sotalol.  There
was no anticoagulation going on.

 5.  TYPE 2 DIABETES ISSUES:  The patient had a hemoglobin
A1c of 10 which demonstrated poor control.  He was continued
on his glyburide which was increased and a diabetic diet.

 6.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient had iron studies consistent
with anemia of chronic disease.  He was guaiac-negative in
the Emergency Department.

He had a normal MIBI in [**2143-6-12**], but given his history of
diabetes should maintain a hematocrit of greater than 28.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells
on [**6-16**] for a hematocrit of less than 27.  The hematocrit
drop was likely secondary to chronic disease and phlebotomy.
He tolerated the transfusion well.

 7.  HYPOXIA ISSUES:  The patient underwent transesophageal
echocardiogram to rule out vegetations given his bacteremia.
He had no vegetations; however, he did have 4+ mitral
regurgitation.  During this time he received Hurricane spray
and developed hemoglobinemia.  He was given methylene blue
with a short course in the Intensive Care Unit following
this, and he recovered well.

The patient had some hypoxia lingering several days
afterwards and had a computed tomography angiogram which was
negative for a pulmonary embolism, but was positive for some
evidence of congestive heart failure.  He was diuresed and
was likely secondary to his 4+ mitral regurgitation.

On [**6-15**], he had a chest x-ray that showed resolution of his
congestive heart failure, and he was eventually was weaned to
room air with oxygen saturations of 93% on room air.

Additionally, this patient is on continuous positive airway
pressure at home for obstructive sleep apnea; although he
denied use while in the hospital.

 8.  DEPRESSION ISSUES:  The patient was continued on Effexor
at his outpatient dose.

 9.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  Diabetic and cardiac
healthy diet.

10.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  Lovenox per Orthopaedic Surgery [**81**]
mg once per day.

11.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient is a full code.

12.  ACCESS ISSUES:  He will need a peripherally inserted
central catheter line placed for weeks of intravenous
antibiotics prior to discharge.

dictated at a later time.
