Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 68yo M with h/o IPF(4L home O2), h/o PE/DVT, diastolic
heart failure with EF 55%, now has restrictive cardiomyopathy.
He was admitted in CCU for tailored diuresis.Despite aggresive
diuresis with natrcor, lasix drip, bumex and metolazone, he
fails to diurese. A search for the cause of restrictive
cardiomyopathy included fat pad biopsy of the heart to rule out
amyloidosis which was negative. Pyrophosphate scan and cardiac
MRI was impossible since patient was unable to lie flat. Renal
team was consulted for renal biopsy. According to them, since
there is no protein in the urine, this is not consistent with
renal amyloidosis and hence biopsy was not indicated.
ULtrafiltration was considered but this is not a long term
solution. Goal of care was discussed extensively with patient
and family. Patient opted for comfort measures and hence was
sent home with hospice.
