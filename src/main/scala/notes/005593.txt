Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
found collapsed at work

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 47 year-old woman who presents after collapsing
at work, found to have a large left basal ganglia hemorrhage.
According to the patient's husband, starting on [**10-29**] the
patient
began complaining of a severe, constant left sided headache.  He
states that this was severe enough that she was unable to watch
the [**Company **] game with him on Sunday, and he also was having to
take care of the cooking and cleaning that she would normally
do,
because she was not feeling well.  The headache persisted, but
this morning she was able to go to work.  Around 9-10am she was
at work, and was found collapsed at her desk, and was noted to
not be moving her right arm.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**],
where she was intubated with etomidate, succinylcholine, versed
and vecuronium, presumably because of concerns about ability to
control her airway.  She was initially found to have a blood
pressure of 195/112, however after intubation and starting
propofol she dropped as low as 114 systolic.  She was briefly
started on neostigmine to then elevate her blood pressure,
however this was stopped on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].  At [**Hospital 26580**]
Hospital
she had a head CT which showed a 2.5x6cm L basal ganglia
hemorrhage, with ~8mm midline shift.  She was given 1g of IV
dilantin, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]

On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], she was initially noted to be quite
agitated, moving all extremities.  She was evaluated by
Neurosurgery, who found her to be localizing to pain, L>R, and
then because of the agitation recommended giving her vecuronium.

As she was determined to not be a surgical candidate, Neurology
was then consulted.

Social History:

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2197-11-9**]**

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2197-11-5**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2197-11-8**]):
      Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         OF TWO COLONIAL MORPHOLOGIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
