History of Present Illness:
80 yo male with hx of schizophrenia, dementia was admitted to
MICU from [**Hospital1 18**] ED after being found to be septic. Patient was
being transported to [**Hospital1 336**]/[**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of vomiting x
few days (2 or 4 days, depending on whose report you read). He
was only responsive to verbal stimuli per EMS notes. and per
evaluation from the ambulance, his BP was 70/30, RR 30s and HR
60s. Of note, patient has been having poor appetite x 4 days.
KUB was apparently negative for obstruction.
.
From his RN home, he was noted to have:
- Cr of 2.9 BUN of 65 on [**2107-9-24**] and digoxin level of 1.5
- INR of 1.07 on [**2107-9-24**] and Pt of 11.6
.
In the ED:
He was alert and following commands. Initially BP responded to
fluids and was in the 110s, then dropped to 67/59 - started on
dopamine.
He was also initially bradycardic to the 40s-50s (but then 110s
for unclear reasons). Dopamine was titrated to 10mcg/kg/min and
then was placed on levophed at 0.5mcg/kg/min and then titrated
up to 3mcg/kg/min. On arrival to the floor, he was on only
Levophed at 3mcg/kg/min.
- increased pulmonary congestion and BiPAP was applied.
- received 7L NS in ED
- got Levo/Flagyl/Vanco
.
Access: A L groin was attempted. Then a R IJ was attempted -
which led to guidewire getting stuck in the IVC filter. This was
removed by Vascular Surgery. Finally, a R femoral line was
placed.

Imaging:
[**2107-9-25**] CXR:
CHEST, SINGLE VIEW: No prior for comparison.  Lung volumes are
low.  The
cardiac shadow is slightly enlarged.  Aorta is ectatic.
Considerable right lung volume loss with collapse of right lower
lobe and partial atelectasis right middle lobe with questionable
cut-off of bronchus intermedius. Although possibly due to
secretions, an obstructing neoplastic mass should be considered.
Initial further evaluation with PA and lateral CXR is
recommended. If persistent, contrast-enhanced CT would be
recommended.
.
[**2107-9-26**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Normal left ventricular
wall
thicknesses and cavity size. There is moderate regional left
ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal half of the
inferior, septal, and anterior walls. The remaining segments are
mildly hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial  effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive
regional
dysfunction c/w multivessel coronary disease. Moderate to severe
aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
Based on [**2097**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic
data.
.
[**2107-9-26**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right deep venous thrombosis of indeterminate age (old clot
per radiology)
2.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis involving the left
lowerextremity.
.
[**2107-9-27**] CXR:
CONCLUSION:  Short-interval improvement in the aeration of the
right lower
lung field, with some residual opacities present in the right
infrahilar
region.

[**2107-9-30**] nasogastric tube placement.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 80 year old male with history of CAD, CHF,
dementia, schizophrenia, chronic renal insufficiency, cardiac
dysrythmia who was admitted for sepsis.
.
1. Septic shock/infectious disease issues: Patient presented
from his nursing home with hypotension, leukocytosis, acute on
chronic renal failure, indicating sepsis.  Initial studies
demonstrated CXR with right lower lobe pneumonia, and u/a that
was positive.  Patient also with some cellulitis in left lower
extremity.  Therefore, intially thought source of sepsis was
pneumonia vs UTI vs cellulitis.  Cortisol stimulation test was
negative, ruling out adrenal insufficiency on admission.  The
patient was fluid rescusitated and initially started on levaphed
for pressor support.  He was maintained on vancomycin and zos
