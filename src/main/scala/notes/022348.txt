Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain
Hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral arterial line

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 yo F with HTN, diastolic CHF, COPD, CRI,
h/o Mobitz II block s/p pacemaker placed [**10-10**], AAA s/p
endovascular repair and ruptured AAA repair w/ graft placement,
SMA/Celiac stents
for mesenteric ischemia, L renal artery stenosis s/p stent c/b
MRSA bacteremia, and a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 26561**] for acute
diastolic CHF, HTN, ARF, who was sent in by her VNA for concerns
of SOB/nausea/diarrhea/weakness. Per the patient, she has had
nausea since prior to her SMA/celiac stent placement and ever
since, including her admission to the hospital a couple of days
ago, and this in no different. She denies nausea or abdominal
pain, fevers, chills. Does have a 30 pound weight loss since
[**Month (only) 958**], mainly in the setting of her abdominal angina prior to
the procedure. In regards to the diarrhea, she was consipated 2
days ago and took colace 2 nights ago, followed by one loose
stool yesterday and took colace again last night, followed by
one loose stool today. No melena or hematochezia, sick contacts,
abnormal foods, or abd pain with this. In regards to the SOB,
she is much improved since her admission on [**1-2**], has not
worsened since discharge, and denies SOB currently. No cough or
URI sxs. In regards to her weakness, this has been longstanding,
in addition to anorexia.
.
ED COURSE: Vitals 97.9, 79, 124/75, 18, 100% RA. After BP
elevated to 192/92, regular home meds of metoprolol and
clinidine were given, as well as one dose of zofran, which
improved her nausea. She was given 1L NS. Guaiac positive.
Touched base with [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] who felt that recent stent, lack of
abd pain, nml lactate made ischemic gut unlikely and did not
recommend imaging (deferred by ED in setting of elevated Cr).

Pertinent Results:
[**1-9**] CTA abdomen:
1.  No CT evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
2.  Stable appearance of the aortobiiliac stent graft as well as
celiac,
superior mesenteric, and left renal artery stents.
3.  Prior cholecystectomy.
4.  Stable appearance of the thrombosed right iliac artery
aneurysm.

[**1-11**] CTA abdomen pelvis
No retroperitoneal hematoma.  No significant change from CT of
[**2113-1-9**].

[**1-14**] CTA C/A/P
1.  No aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.  Extensive
atherosclerotic
disease is present in the aorta, coronary arteries, and the
branches of the abdominal aorta.
2.  Patent stents are seen in the celiac axis, superior
mesenteric artery, and left renal artery.  There is focal
stenosis at the origin of the right renal artery.
3.  Aortoiliac graft with stents is patent.

[**1-9**] CT head
Diffuse predominantly parietal, occipital, and frontal cortical
hyperdensity. This may represent diffuse cortical hemorrhage
versus enhancement of areas of ischemia/infarct.  Recommend MRI
for better characterization of this lesion.

[**1-10**] CT head
Less conspicuous hyperdensity/enhancement of the parietal and
occipital lobes bilaterally with effacement of sulci.  The
previously seen
hyperdensity/enhancement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter bilaterally
has
essentially resolved.  Given the relative rapid change in
appearance, these findings less likely represent cortical
hemorrhage and more likely represent persistent enhancement in
areas of ischemia/infarct.  The distribution of findings is
suggestive of PRES.  This can be better evaluated by an MRI.

[**1-13**] CT head - No acute abnormality seen

CXR [**2113-1-8**]: Two views are compared with recent study dated
[**2113-1-1**]. There has been interval complete resolution of the
findings of CHF, and the lungs are clear with no pleural
effusion. There is baseline hyperinflation with diaphragm
flattening, suggestive of underlying obstructive lung disease,
and residual prominence of the central pulmonary arteries may
reflect underlying
pulmonary hypertension. A left-sided dual-chamber cardiac
pacemaker device has intact leads in the RA and RV apex, as
before. There is diffuse osteopenia.
.
[**2113-1-5**] renal artery U/S:
1. Limited study, with parvus and tardus waveforms of the
bilateral
interlobar arteries, right main renal artery, and upper pole
branch of the right renal artery, suggesting more proximal
stenosis. However, the renal artery ostia could not be
son[**Name (NI) 5326**] interrogated. MRA correlation may be of benefit,
if clinically indicated.
2. Mildly elevated resistive indices of the left renal cortex.
.
[**2113-1-4**] ECHO: Mild LVH, EF >55%, no vegetations
.
[**2112-11-7**]: CT abd/pelvis:
1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic pathology.
2. Small filling defect in the SMA distal to the stent
concerning for nonocclusive thrombus. Findings appear new from
recent CTA exam dated [**2112-10-20**].
3. Relatively stable appearance of aorto- bifemoral graft. New
left renal artery stent.
4. Stable, post-operative changes of the spine with grade I
anterolisthesis at the L4-5 level.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 F with MMP admitted of SOB/nausea/diarrhea/weakness.
.
PT was admitted for chief concern of nausea without complaints
of abdominal pain.  The morning after admission pt had
increasing abdominal pain and nausea.  In the mid morning of HD
2, pt triggered for severe abdominal pain and hypertension (SBP
208/110).  PT continued to complain of severe abdominal pain and
was still unable to take PO medication. She was treated with IV
morphine, IV metoprolol, and TD clonidine, and BP improved to
180's.  She was sent for a stat CT abdomen, and upon return the
pt lost IV access.  She had continued abdominal pain, worsening
hypertension (SBP 200's) and mental status changes. IV access
was not able to be obtained and she received an inch of nitro
paste and 1 SL nitro.  Her BP improved to the 180's, and pt was
transferred to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, PIV in L antecubital obtained.  SBP
>200.  The patient was witness to seize, 2 mg IV ativan and 10
IV lopressor were given.  Pt was noted to foa
