Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of right IJ line

History of Present Illness:
88 yo F with PAF, dementia, CHF, stage 4 sacral decub, IDDM, and
other medical issues went to OSH from nursing home with fever
and altered mental status today.  She vomited 1x prior to
transfer to OSH, tachypneic with O2Sat down to 82% on 3L
(baseline 2L since [**Month (only) **]).  It was thought she has a UTI and PNA
on CXR (bilateral increased reticular nodular interstitial
markings R>L).  She became hypotensive with SBP in the 80s, but
there was no unit bed in the OSH.  She was noted to fever up to
102.6F and tachycardia up to 130s.  She received Zosyn and 2L
IVF with requirments of 4L O2 (on home oxygen).  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Per HCP/son, patient has had 3 TIAs around [**Month (only) **] this year with
minimal residual deficit, although there is ? of left sided
weakness and swallowing problem.  Since that time, a sacral
decubitus wound was noted and begin to get treated in [**Hospital **] rehab.
Her wound was debrided at [**Last Name (un) 27217**] in the beginning of [**Month (only) 958**]
with several days of ICU stay.  Per family, she had + culture of
a very resistant bacteria that is not MRSA.  She required 2 IV
antibiotics.  Later, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] North for
long term care for her wound for a total of about 6 weeks.  She
had wound vac and Foley catheter which is c/b frequent UTIs.
Later, she was transferred to Country Rehab, initially wound was
healing well, but found to have necrotic tissue, requiring
debridement again in [**Month (only) 116**].  Patient's mental status since [**Month (only) 116**] has
gradually deteriorated.  She was able to meet with a lawyer to
work on her living will in the beginning of [**Month (only) 116**], but over the
last week, was confused about her name and her location.
.
On transfer, she got a 3rd L of IVF with improvement of SBP to
the 100s
.
In the ED, she was noted to be afebrile at 97.2, sinus
tachycardia up to 120s with BP 95/70, RR 30 on 94% 4L.  Exam was
significant for sacral decubitus ulcer 10 cm with granulation
tissue on outer circumfirential segment with central necrotic
area.  She was noted to have leukocytosis up to 32 and mildly
elevated LFTs.  Coagulatons were normal.  Lactate...after 3L
normalized.  CXR suggests interstitial and alveolar process.
Per report, she received vancomycin and Flagyl, for concern of
C. diff given leukocytosis, diarrhea, and recent Abx.  However,
only flagyl was noted on ED chart.  SBP improved to 100 after 3L
IVF, but then dropped again to the 80s, so Levophed was started
through PIV first.  She got RIJ CVL.  CVP improved from 5-> [**7-27**]
after 4L, SvO2 90s.  Prior to transfer, T 97.6 (temporal), 98
NSR, BP 102/62 (72), RR 27, O2Sat 97% 4L on 0.05 mcg/kg/min
norepinephrine.
.
On the floor, patient reports not feeling very well, threw up 1x
this morning and has been having diarrhea but could not tell
when it started.  Denies pain currently.
