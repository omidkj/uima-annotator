History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16585**] is a 77 yo man with 3 vessel CAD s/p CABG [**5-7**] and
s/p LAD stenting [**4-7**] who presents with crescendo chest
discomfort over the last week.
.
He had done well since his last stent placement in [**4-7**], with no
need for nitroglycerin until two weeks prior to admission. He
developed chest discomfort with light activity such as climbing
one flight of stairs or carrying packages. The chest discomfort
was sternal in location, sometimes radiating to his bilateral
shoulders, arms, and jaw, [**4-10**] in intensity, and relieved at
first within minutes of one nitroglycerin. It felt like his
prior angina. He had some associated diaphoresis and nausea,
without dyspnea or palpitations. His chest discomfort was not
pleuritic in character nor did it feel like heartburn. His
nitroglycerin requirement increased over the weeek to the point
where he was taking 4 nitroglycerin per episode, leading him to
seek medical attention.
.
In the ED, his vitals were T 97.3, P 52, BP 151/61, RR 16, O2
99% RA. He was given ASA 325mg. He was taken to the cath lab
where he was found to have 80% stenosis of the LAD at D1 origin
with patent proximal LAD stent, and 70% stenosis of the mid RCA.
The procedure was complicated by dissection of the LAD,
necessitating placement of DESx2 to the LAD. His D1 was occluded
post stenting.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient initially complained of
[**5-11**] chest discomfort that improved with lopressor and IV
morphine.
.
Review of systems is positive for prior stroke, claudications,
and night time leg cramps. He denies any history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
cough, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He does have chronic constipation and urinary
frequency. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Unstable Angina: He underwent a cardiac cath which was
complicated by a dissection of LAD, now s/p LAD stenting which
in turn was compliated by a block of D1.  He was temporarily on
a balloon pump in the cath lab to enhance coronary perfusion.
The balloon removed in the CCU.  His ACEI and beta blocker were
titrated up during this hospitalization.  He was also continued
on his ASA/plavix/statin.
.
CHF: TTE with severe apical hypokinesis, EF 30%; clinically
euvolemic with no signs of HF.  He was treated with betablocker
and ACE.
.
Anemia:  On admission with hct 39-->33.  Guaiac negative, no
evidence of acute bleed.  Hemodynamically stable.
.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  With baseline Cr 1.1-1.2.  On
discharge with Cr 1.4 in setting of contrast load with cardiac
catheterization.  Received post cath IVF with bicarb.
