Brief Hospital Course:
1. Upper GIB bleed: Pt admitted with 2 PIVs, type and crossed,
transfused a total of 1 unit of blood while in ED. NGT lavage
cont. to be coffee grounds for a first part of stay and then
cleared, when NGT was d/c'd. GI consult felt pt did not need
emergent scope, likely medication related gastritis. Hct
remained stable for rest of hospital stay. However, given other
medical problems, GI felt that he should be scoped as an outpt
when other medical issues were stable. Placed on protonix 40 mg
[**Hospital1 **], scheduled for outpt GI follow up for outp EGD/colonoscopy.

2. Hypotension: Thought to be related to blood loss. Improved
with blood products within 24 hrs not requiring pressors.

3. Acute Renal Failure: Pt with renal insufficiency on arrival
who had ATN [**3-7**] to hypotension. Cr remained 2.7-3.0 during
hopsital stay and did not improved with hydration. Renal consult
confirmed this with urine studies. Given his CHF, they felt it
was reasonable to continue his lasix [**Hospital1 **]. His urine outpt
remained extremely good while in house. F/u with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 14064**] in a
few weeks.

4. COPD exaccerbation: ABG suggested resp acidosis liklely
chronic. His 02 sat on arrival was 100% on 4 L. Placed on
prednisone 60 mg and tapered. Will need to continue taper as
outpt with baseline at 5 mg. CXR's revealed no infection. He was
placed on azithromycine for antiinflamatory effects. His o2
requirement decreased and he is [**Age over 90 **]% on room air with mild
destauration on ambulation. He was given neb txts as needed and
then returned to scheduled inhalers.

5. Tacycardia: Pt in sinus tachycardia for first part of visit.
Increase BB and CCB to current dose with good effect. On
telemetry no events except one 6 beat run of NSVT when he was
asx. PTs rate 70-90s on D/c on current regimen.

6. Atrial fibrillation: Pt on coumadin for many days. However,
given delirium and risk of falling, it was decided by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
to stop this for now and readdress this as an outpt.

7. Neuro: MRI on admission showed evidence of old infarct.
Slurred speech was concerning to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team so neuro consutl
obtained showing toxic-metabolic delirium related to renal
failure and alcohol use. Over the next few days on the floor, pt
would occassionally become agitated requiring zyprexa and ativan
(out pt med). Psych consult revealed that seroquel would be
helpful in managing agitation. He will follow up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
to determine further pscyh follow up . Cont on ativan for
aggitation.

8. Petichial rash: Stable rash on lower legs. Unclear etiology.
Plts stable and DIc panel checked and was negative. Follow this
as outpt.

9. Diabetes: Elevated BS while on stress dose steroids. No need
for insulin now but would check BS and cover appropriately.
Needs to be readdressed once on 5 mg prednisone.

10. Ankle pain: Likely related to edema. Xrays checked and
offical read need to be f/u as outpt.

Pt was seen by PT/OT and rehab reccomended for deconditioning.
Wife supportive and involved in care.
