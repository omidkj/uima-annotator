Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1828**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea; abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
64y/o gentleman with DM, HTN, CAD and recent [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission for
necrotizing pancreatitis and pseudocyst is now admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for IR-guided drainage of enlarging pseudocyst.

He was admitted from [**Date range (1) 79527**] for necrotizing pancreatitis that
began in [**2142-4-28**] and was complicated by shock, bacteremia, VAP,
hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and eventually
tracheostomy.  He had been discharged to rehab, and 2 days later
his trach was removed and he was breathing fine on RA during the
day, 1L NC st night.  He [**Year (4 digits) 5058**] on the morning of presentation
with nausea and abdominal pain, so he presented to the ED.  It
is epigastric, moving horizontally but not to the back, and is a
deep pain.  His pain is very similar to prior pancreatitis pain,
but the nausea is new.  No vomiting, no fever/chills.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.1, HR 100, BP 122/62, RR 14,
SaO2100%RA
By the time of presentation his abdominal pain had subsided, and
his exam was benign.  He had a mild leukocytosis (11.1) and
amylase was 112.  His Cr was 1.6 (baseline 1.3) so he was
hydrated with 1200cc IVF and Mucomyst (slowly, as patient has
history of CHF), then sent for abdomen CT with contrast.  This
showed enlarging pancreatic pseudocyst, pelvic fluid collection
smaller than on previous imaging, new small fluid collection
anterior to pancreas as well as new small pseudocyst in
pancreatic head.  Upon returning from CT, he complained of [**5-7**]
abdominal pain and he was given a total of 8mg IV morphine, and
Zofran.
He is tachycardic, but his blood pressures have been stable and
he has no fever.  Surgery is aware of the patient; they feel
that there is no need for surgical intervention at this time.
He is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with plans for IR drainage of
the pseudocyst.

On the floor, the patient is without complaints.  He has no
abdominal pain.  Not nauseous currently, but has no appetite.
Does have an itchy rash that he has had since his last
hospitalization that has been treated at rehab with antifungal
powder and Benadryl.

[**2142-9-7**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis with Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. The large pancreatic body pseudocyst has continued to enlarge
further
across multiple prior studies. There is now possibly development
of a
satellite pseudocyst and/or adjacent small peripancreatic fluid
collections as detailed above.
2. There is a relatively eccentric but traumatic wall thickening
of the
adjoining gastric body, pylorus, and proximal duodenum. This may
be reactiv
in nature if pancreatic enzymes continue to leach or also may
represent a
coincident gastritis. Correlate clinically. This may account for
an acute
pain as described. Not mentioned above, there may be a minimal
amount of
fluid tracking within the gastrohepatic ligament.
3. The relatively wide [**Name (NI) 79528**] pelvic collection previously
described has
decreased in size from the prior exam. The previously noted
pigtail
percutaneous drain is no longer present.
4. Persistent right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pancreatic pseudocyst.  CT imaging showed enlarging
pancreatic pseudocyst.  GI and surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed
options for drainage and initially determined that the best
course was endoscopic drainage. However, during the
hospitalization his pain improved and he remained stable, with
no laboratory evidence of worsened pancreatitis.  After
discussion with patient, it was agreed to postpone the drainage,
given risks involved, and reassess in about 1-2 weeks.
Outpatient follow-up with CT, followed by appointment in
Gastroenterology, was arranged.

2. Acute renal failure.  Baseline is 1.3.  It was felt that
acute renal failure was  likely prerenal on admission.   He
improved to baseline with hyudration.

3. Pleural effusion.  Previously attributed to
trans-diaphragmatic ascites.  Not felt to represent
CHF/cardiogenic volume overload.

4. Depression-- contniued on SSRI

On [**9-14**] he was deemed appropriate for transfer to a rehab
facility and this was arranged.
