Swallowing Study

SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Pt is demonstrating overt s&s aspiration at bedside with thin
liquids, consistently, however he appears to be tolerating
nectar
thick liquids and softer solids. Unclear etiology of dysphagia
though pt is presenting with some generalized oral and
pharyngeal
weakness. As such, would suggest initiate modified po diet
texture at this time with repeat bedside swallow evaluation in
[**1-20**] days.

Cardiology Report ECG


Atrial flutter with ventricular premature beat. Incomplete right
bundle-branch block. Since the previous tracing of [**2119-2-14**]
atrial wave morphology is slightly more suggestive of flutter,
but probably no significant change.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: Swan-Ganz catheter is present with
its tip in the right ventricular outflow tract. There is an NG
tube in good position and endotracheal tube also in good
position. Prominence of the aortic knob is noted. There is no
pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted
again. Lung volumes are lower than on the prior film, but there
are no focal areas of opacity with the exception of some
subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe. There is some
blunting of the left CP angle, may relate to atelectasis or
small effusion.

IMPRESSION: Satisfactory lines and tubes without pneumothorax.
Possible small left pleural effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to the vascular service [**2119-2-7**]

Pt underwent a resection repair of abdominal week aneurysm with
24 x 12 bifurcated aortobi-iliac graft. on [**2119-2-7**]. Pt tolerated

[**Date Range 13042**] in stable condition, In the [**Name (NI) 13042**] pt did recieve fluids. He
was weaned off the vent on [**2119-2-8**].

On [**2119-2-8**] pt [**Date Range **] to the VICU in stable condition.
[**2117-2-9**] pt had difficulty maintaining o2 sats, a CXR, was
obtained - showed mild CHF. Pt was was given lasix with good
response. Pt also experienced ICU pshychosis - give haldol.
During this state of confusion the pt again became hypoxic. Pt
transferd to the SICU.

[**2119-2-10**] - [**2119-2-16**] In the SICU multiple of entites occured. 1) PT
experienced A - Fib, started on heperin. given beta blocker for
rate control. Pt R/O for MI. 2) Pt also experienced increase of
temperature to 101, pt was pan cx. his sputum grew gram neg
rods, CXR showed RUL pneumonia - tx with AB, CPT, NEBS. 3) CHF,
pt treated with restriction of fluids, lasix, weight monitered.
This resolved. 4) Pt experienced ARF secondary to hypovolemai
from lasix. Pt cret.pre op was 1.2 got to 2.3, on DC improved to
1.8.

[**2119-2-15**] Pt started to improve, PT/Casemanagement/ got involved.
Also pt had a hard time swallowing a swallowing study was
obtained. Pt swallowing gradually improved uon discharge.
