ALLERGIES:  Indocin causes anaphylaxis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General:  The patient was an elderly
man lying in bed, comfortable, in no acute distress.  Lungs:
Decreased breath sounds at the bases, right greater than left
with bibasilar crackles to a quarter of the way up, otherwise
clear to auscultation.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.
Distant heart sounds.  No murmurs appreciated.  Abdomen:
Hepatobiliary scar with PTC drain in place.  The abdomen was
tympanic.  Positive hepatomegaly to 5 cm below the costal
margin.  No splenomegaly appreciated.  Extremities:  There
was 3+ pitting edema bilaterally, Guaiac positive.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 8.2, hematocrit
36.3, platelets 222,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 5.1, chloride
106, bicarbonate 24, BUN 36, creatinine 1.9, glucose 98.
Baseline creatinine 1.2.  Coagulations were normal.  AST 67,
ALT 63, alkaline phosphatase 348, total bilirubin 0.7,
albumin 2.6 on [**2193-1-28**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2193-2-22**] which found graft occlusion of
the SVG RCA.  He had successful PTCA and stenting of the
ramus intermedius and was started on aspirin, Plavix,
Integrelin post catheterization.

On [**2193-2-23**], he developed melena, dizziness.  He was found to
be hypotensive to 70/50 with decreased 02 saturations.  He
was transferred to the MICU and urgent endoscopy showed
clots, small bleeding, with friable and granular antrum of
the stomach.  The patient was aggressively resuscitated with
6 units of packed red blood cells, vitamin K, and fluid
boluses for decreased urine output.  He was started on IV
Protonix b.i.d.

The patient developed acute renal failure, likely secondary
to ATN from hypotension and contrast.  In light of the
patient's poor EF and increasing volume overload the patient
was started on urgent hemodialysis.  A dialysis catheter was
placed in the right groin site.  The patient transiently
needed dopamine for hypotension.  He was continued on
antiplatelet agents.  The patient improved with hemodialysis
and was felt stable for transfer to the floor.

The patient was transferred to the floor and urine output
improved.  The patient had post ATN diuresis.  His pulmonary
status improved.  With his increased urine output, his
creatinine trended down.  His hemodialysis catheter was
pulled.  The patient started complaining of increasing pain
at the site of his hemodialysis catheter; cross-cover noted
the patient to have a bruit at the site.  The patient had a
femoral ultrasound which showed a 3 cm pseudoaneurysm.

The patient was taken to ultrasound and had thrombin
injection.  The pseudoaneurysm was thrombosed.  The patient
was noted to still have persistent AV fistula at the site and
will need a follow-up ultrasound in one months time.  After
the hemodialysis catheter was pulled, the patient was allowed
to ambulate and sit in a chair.  In this setting, he had
increasing pedal edema formation from 1+ to 3+.  The
patient's urine output began to drop off so the patient was
re-initiated on his Lasix, initially 40 mg q.d. which was
then increased to 40 mg b.i.d., aiming to keep his urine
output at net minus liter per day.

The patient's creatinine drifted down to 1.7 despite
diuresis.  At the time of discharge, the patient still had 3+
pitting edema, however, the patient was felt stable for
discharge to home as he was able to ambulate without dyspnea
and maintained high 02 saturations.

The patient was willing to follow-up with his cardiologist.
His cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient will see his
cardiologist tomorrow for repeat laboratory checks and the
determination of what dose of Lasix to continue on.

During the hospital course, the patient had slightly elevated
liver enzymes to the 100s.  These were attributed to hepatic
congestion from his CHF.  His transaminases trended down.
His alkaline phosphatase remained slightly elevated in the
300s.  The patient was continued on Lactulose q.i.d. to q.
four hours, aiming for three to four bowel movements per day.
The patient showed no signs of encephalopathy during the
hospital course.

The patient's diabetes was controlled with a diabetic diet
and a regular insulin sliding scale.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of ramus
intermedius.
2.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
3.  Acute renal failure requiring temporary hemodialysis.
4.  Pseudoaneurysm.
5.  Residual AV fistula in the right inguinal region.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Hepatic insufficiency.
8.  Diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lactulose 15 mils t.i.d.
2.  Neomycin 500 mg two tablets p.o. q. eight hours.
3.  Ursodiol 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Ferrous sulfate 325 p.o. t.i.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg b.i.d.
6.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.  The patient was instructed to take
an additional dose tonight and then the dose will be
determined by the cardiologist.
7.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
8.  Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
9.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. times 30 days.
10. Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his
cardiologist tomorrow for a recheck of his BP and
laboratories and determine what dose of Lasix and BP
medications the patient should be on.  The patient should
follow-up with his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] needs a
femoral ultrasound in one month to evaluate for resolution of
his AV fistula in the right inguinal region.
