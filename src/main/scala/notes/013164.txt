History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman who was transferred from [**Hospital 6136**]
Hospital ([**Location (un) 34973**])for evaluation of subdural hematoma. We were told that
she had a mechanical fall that day.. She was at her PCPs office
when she reported a mild headache. A CT scan was done at the
outside hospital which revealed an acute on chronic subdural
hematoma. Patient was given mannitol and intubated. There is no
other significant injury identified on their exam. Her CT scan
of her C-spine is negative for fracture. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**],
neurosurgery was consulted for evaluation.


Past Medical History:
PMH: anemia (?bone marrow failure, transfused monthly), CAD,
CHF, CRF
PSH: hysterectomy, ear surgery


Social History:
Daughter [**Name (NI) 1439**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 112190**]
[**Name2 (NI) **]r social hx is unknown

Family History:
Unknown

Physical Exam:
On admission:

Initial exam: No EO, no gag, weak cough, + bilateral corneals, R
pupil 3-2mm reactive, L pupil 2mm nonreactive, no BUE movement
to noxious, LLE triple flexion, RLE weak withdrawl.
Repeat exam: Unchanged but R pupil 5mm NR, L pupil 3mm NR.


Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**2146-8-5**]:

IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarging right subdural hematoma with worsening leftward
midline shift, increased bihemispheric sulcal effacement,
worsening effacement of the right lateral ventricle, left
lateral ventricle entrapment, and moderate suprasellar and mild
quadrigeminal cistern effacement.  No tonsillar herniation.
2. Slightly increased soft tissue gas near the right TMJ and
posterior to the right maxillary sinus, but no obvious fracture.


[**2146-8-5**] CXR
1.  Low endotracheal tube, as above, recommend withdrawal by [**1-7**]
cm.
2.  Pulmonary edema, asymmetric, right greater than left, may be
neurogenic in origin


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a right SDH and midline shift.
She was intubated and medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **]. She
did not require any sedation during [**Location (un) **]. Upon arrival to
the ER, she was intubated but not sedated. On initial
examination, R pupil was 3-2mm and L pupil was 2mm nonreactive.
There was no gag but a weak cough, + bilateral corneals, no BUE
movement to noxious, no EO, LLE triple flexion, RLE weak
withdraw. Her head CT from the OSH showed a R sided SDH with
midline shift, the SDH is acute on chronic. Patient was on ASA
and Plavix and did not receive any reversal agents prior to
transport. Given that her exam did not correlate to her imaging,
interval of time from OSH head CT, and anticoagulation, a CT
head was repeated. The CT showed the R SDH had worsened and the
midline shift progressed and was 15mm vs. 10mm on initial CT.
She received platelets and Desmopressin. She was also bolused
with Dilantin. Her VS remained stable. A contact number for her
daughter was found in OSH records. The daughter confirmed she
was DNR, and given the prognosis and family wishes- the family
wanted no aggressive treatment. She was made CMO. Patient was
kept intubated and transferred to the ICU. Family expressed they
were unable to get to the hospital at that time, but would be
able to the next day.

The family was again contact[**Name (NI) **] on [**2146-8-6**] to identify the patient
and were informed that if they did not arrive prior to
expiration that they would have to unfortunately identify her in
the morgue. They did not arrive prior to her expiration that
evening.
