History of Present Illness:
76YOM presents with increasing fatigue, weakness over past
several days. Does have a history of MS (followed by neuro
here), but states that this does not feel like his usual flares.
Was on the toilet today and felt like he couldn't get up from
the commode because he was too weak. Family attempted to get him

was found on the commonde, no AC and was extremely hot in the
apartment/bathroom, patient was diaphoretic, but drastically
improved in the ambulance.

16 97% and triggered for hypotension. A CXR demonstrated
profoundly diminshed lung volumes, no acute process. CT Abdomen
negative. His lactate was elevated to 4.2 and he received 3L of
fluid, normalizing to 1.1. Guaiac positive in ED and received 1
unit of blood. BP stabilized with fluids and blood. Admitted for
LGIB. Vitals on transfer 112/60 p78 rr 16 t98.3 sat 100.

IMAGING
TTE [**2166-7-9**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
basal to mid inferior and inferolateral segments. Doppler
parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic
function. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate pericardial effusion, located
mostly over the right ventricular free wall. Regional LV
systolic dysfunction consistent with prior inferior infarction.
No significant valvular abnormality. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
CXR [**2166-7-19**]
1. Slight interval worsening of findings at the right base, with
more
confluent opacity and new small right effusion.
2. Minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity and blunting of the left
costophrenic angle are stable.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
76 year old M PMHx multiple sclerosis, CAD s/p stent who
presented with increasing fatigue, was found to have an
aspiration PNA, and had a hospital course complicated by
recurrent aspirations, now status post tracheostomy and gtube
placement, hemodynamically stable, on antibioitics for recurrent
pneumonia, being discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Respiratory Failure [**1-8**] Aspiration Pneumonia and Heart Failure
On day after admission, pt w rising leukocytosis and increasing
oxygen requirements, CXR demonstrating RLL consolidation.
Patient was transferred to ICU where he was intubated for
hypoxic respiratory failure.  Patient was treated with 1wk
vanc/zosyn with subsequent improvement.  Patient was also found
to have evidence of pulmonary vascular congestions and was
diuresed.  Patient was subsequently extubated.  Swallow study
demonstrated aspiration.  Patient required reintubation several
days later after development of respiratory distress attributed
to recurrent aspiration.
Spoke with patient's neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who felt that patient
had been losing weight for the past year and while his
difficulty swallowing could be a reversible symptom of worsened
MS in the setting of acute illness, more perminent enteral
access was recommended.  PEG tube was placed.  Given recurrent
aspiration pneumonias and difficulty extubating, patient
underwent tracheostomy.  He tolerated tube feeds well.  As of
time of discharge, patient remained with signs of a RLL
pneumonia, cultures growing pan-sensitive enterobacter, which
was being treated with PO cipro ( to be continued until
[**2166-7-25**]).  He remained w secretions, but was otherwise stable
off of the ventilator on trach-mist >48hrs.  Continued nebs
standing.  Patient will need eval for pauci-muir valve in
future.
.
# Chronic Lower GI Bleed - The patient was anemic to hgb 9.2 on
admission with guiac + stools. His PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 2025**] reported that the
patient has had significant weight loss of 40lbs over the past 6
months with decreased appetite and worsening anemia over that
time period.  No known etiology and colonoscopy clean in [**2157**].
He received 1 uni
