History of Present Illness:
71 yo F with dementia, ESRD on HD, respiratory failure s/p
trach, s/p PEG, COPD, recurrent aspiration PNA, and hx of C.diff
colitis is transferred from the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU after having
two hypotensive/unresponsive episodes during HD.  Rather than
take fluid off, they gave the patient 500 cc.  Per the patient's
son, the patient has been having difficulties for the past nine
weeks, with delerium that finally resolved after adding
phosphate binders, correcting lyte (hypercalcemia, hyperpphos)
abnormalities, and d/c'ing sedating medications.  Per rehab
records, she recently had recurrent C diff, and was treated with
Zosyn for PNA with cxs + for Providencia stuartii, Psuedomonas,
and Citrobacter.  She appeared to recover when she was noted
about 1 week prior to admission be increasingly hypotensive with
altered mental status.  She had blood and C diff cxs from [**6-11**]
which were negative.  Sputum cultures again grew Citrobacter and
Pseudomonas.  She was started on Levaquin for Citrobacter
(Pseudomonas was presumed to be a colonizer) but she was noted
to have worsening resp status with increasingly purulent sputum.
 On [**6-15**] her antibiotics were changed to Tobramycin and
Cefepime.  Her WBC has continued to rise, she had an episode of
atrial fibrillation, and then the above mentioned episodes at
HD.
.
In the ED, Patient's blood pressures were initially in the 90's
- 100's and the patient's mental status was at baseline per her
son.  [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] count returned at 20.1 and her CXR came back as
having BL infiltrates concerning for multifocal PNA vs
aspiration.  She then began to drop her pressures into the 60's
systolic.  A code sepsis was called.  She received 2 liters of
fluid and was started on peripheral levophed.  A central lines
was placed and her initial CVP was 13 and her lactate was 1.5.
She appeared to be having significant oral secretions and
de-satting down to the 80's so she was placed on the ventilator.
 She was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, Azithromycin and admitted
to MICU for further work-up and management.
.
Per her son, at baseline she is able to hold a coherent
conversation although she has some chronic deficits from her
previous CVA's including frequent altered mental status with
infections or lyte abnormalities, finding it difficult to
explain where her pain is in her body, and being easily
overstimulated (lights, sounds.)  She had some diarrhea at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab today, and again in the ED, and one episode of
vomiting this AM.  Her baseline temp is 97.8 and she rarely gets
fevers when infected.

Physical Exam:
VS: T: BP: 114/54 P: 66 RR: O2 sat: 100%
GEN: Lying in bed, NAD
HEENT: PERRL, cloudy cornea, Mouth open with dry tongue. no
obvious OP lesions
NECK: trach in place
CV: RRR, nl S1 and S2, no m/r/g
PULM: CTA bilaterally, no wheezes/rhonchi/crackles.
ABD: Soft, grimaces on palpation, mildly distended, active bowel
sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly
EXT: warm, no edema of LEs, no rashes, lidoderm patch on feet
bilaterally, dry gangrenous toes bilaterally and auto-amputated
toes on L. R great toe looks dry and auto-amputating. No signs
of infection in any toes, however.
NEURO: awake, opens eyes spontaneously, but does not follow any
commands.  Uncooperative with exam.


Pertinent Results:
FINDINGS: A single frontal view of the chest labeled "PCXR
upright at 15:00 p.m." excludes the uppermost portion of the
left lung apex. A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.
The left-sided hemodialysis catheter again terminates at the
cavoatrial junction. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Perihilar
opacities, probable small bilateral pleural effusions, and
Kerley B lines are consistent with mild CHF. In addition,
airspace opacities in the right upper
lobe abutting the major fissure and opacity in the right lower
lung field may represent pneumonia or aspiration. No
pneumothorax is evident.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are
again noted along the thoracic aorta. A tube overlying the left
upper abdomen is again seen. No rib fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION: Right-sided opacities may represent multifocal
pneumonia versus aspiration. These findings are superimposed on
underlying mild CHF.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 yo F with dementia, CVAs, ESRD on HD, chronic
respiratory failure s/p trach, s/p PEG, COPD, recurrent
aspiration PNA, and recent hx of C diff colitis transferred from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU with septic shock.
.
1) Septic shock: Patient has infiltrates on CXR concerning for
PNA, infectious vs recurrent aspiration PNA.  At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
grew out resistant Pseudomonas and Citrobacter in her sputum.
She was being treated for Citrobacter and Pseudomonas pneumonia
with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Gentamycin.  When her cultures from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab returned, the Pseudomonas was only intermediate
sensitive to the gentamycin and she was switched to Vanc, Zosyn,
and Amikacin which were dosed at various levels as her kidney
function fluctuated.  A sputum sample sent here grew out
Pseudomonas which was sensitive to gentamycin and Amikacin.
Patient was left on the Amikacin, dosed by level.  Additonal
possible sources for infection included her multiple lines.  She
had a PICC lines placed at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**6-15**] and a tunneled
line catheter, which proved to be non-functioning and was
removed.  Cultures were sent from all her lines and were all
negative.  She is anuric.  She had no other localizing signs or
symptoms.  She initially required levophed and vasopressin,
titrated to systolic blood pressure rather than MAPs given her
chronically low diastolic blood pressure.  She was extremely
difficult to wean so she was started on stress dose steroids on
[**6-18**].  She came off both pressors by [**6-21**] and stress dose
steroids were d/c'd on [**6-22**].  Given her obvious pneumonia, lack
of signs of local infection, and negative blood cultures from
her lines, her PICC line was left in place.  She recovered from
her shock and tolerated fluid removal by intermittent HD prior
to discharge. Her antibiotics will be continued until [**2188-7-1**].
.
2) Respiratory failure: Patient has chronic trach but has not
been vent dependent since [**2188-1-5**] prior to this admission.  As
noted above she was vented in the ED for thick yellow secretions
and hypoxia to the 80's.  She continued to have thick pale
yellow secretions while on the vent.  She was placed on standing
albuterol and atrovent nebs, and QVAR for her history of COPD.
She received aggressive pulmonary toilet.
.
3) ESRD: Pt is on M-W-F HD schedule but was not able to receive
HD given her pressor-dependent septic shock.  Renal was
consulted.  CVVH was schedule to be initiated on but was
post-poned when it was discovered th
