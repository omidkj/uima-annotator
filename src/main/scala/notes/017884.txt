CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bright red blood per rectum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year-old
Russian speaking male with a history of diabetes, coronary
artery disease and cardiomyopathy who presented with bright
red blood per rectum upon waking from sleep at 1:30 a.m. on
the morning of admission.  He denied any belly pain or
diarrhea.  He had no previous history of a GI bleed.  He does
endorse a history of constipation.  There is a question of a
history of a colonoscopy in the past, but this is remote.  He
was evaluated in the Emergency Room where he received 2 units
of fresh frozen platelets for an INR of 2.9 as well as 10 mg
of vitamin K.  He was also transfused with 2 units of packed
red blood cells for a hematocrit of 29.7.  He was also given
an nasogastric lavage, which was negative.  He was admitted
to the MICU for 1 liter output of rectal bleeding in the
Emergency Room.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION TO THE MICU:
Temperature afebrile.  Blood pressure 143/63.  Pulse 69.
Respirations 18.  99% on room air.  In general, he was a
pleasant Russian speaking male lying in bed in no acute
distress.  HEENT examination pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Mucous membranes are moist.  No carotid
bruits.  Heart was irregular irregular with a grade 2 out of
6 systolic ejection murmur.  Lungs revealed mild crackles at
the right base.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities were
warm with weak dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, but
positive radial and femoral pulses.  Neurological examination
revealed the patient to be alert and oriented and
communicating with Russian staff fluently.

LABORATORIES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count 7.4,
hematocrit 29.7, MCV 82, platelets 179.  His baseline
Hematocrit is known to be 33 to 36%.  His INR was 2.9. His
Chem 7 is remarkable for a BUN of 84 and a creatinine of 2.1
and a glucose of 391.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  He was
initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for large
rectal bleeding output.  His nasogastric lavage was negative.
 He was transfused as mentioned above and was seen by the
gastroenterology team.  He had also been seen by the surgery
team as well.  The results of an early nuclear scan for
bleeding showed findings consistent with a cecal bleed.  He
was sent to interventional radiology for further diagnostic
evaluation for localizing the site of the bleed and had a
selective mesenteric angiogram.  The patient was found to
have active bleeding from the branch of the ileocolic artery,
which was selectively embolized with four 2 mm by 2 cm coils
with cessation of active extravasation of contrast.  He was
transfused 2 more units to support his anemia to a hematocrit
of 25% and was called out to the floor when his bleeding
stabilized.  He was also seen by surgery who was concerned
for ischemia of the embolized segment.  For this reason the
gastroenterology team also agreed that a colonoscopy would
place the patient at a higher risk for perforation of the
segment of the colon, which was effaced by ileocolic artery
embolization.  By [**2-26**] he had received 11 units of packed
red blood cells and the patient was called out to the floor.
He remained stable in terms of his bleeding.  He did endorse
a couple of episodes of small dark spotted blood with his
bowel movements, but none of these resulted in a drop in his
hematocrit.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2169-1-28**] who had the patient go for a nuclear
stress test, which revealed a moderate reversible perfusion
defect in the anterior wall and anterior portion of the apex
that was consistent with stress induced ischemia.  He was
held off his aspirin until his hematocrit stabilized and then
restated on a baby aspirin.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw the patient while
he was in house, recommending that the patient have his acute
GI issues settle out before doing a cardiac catheterization
at the end of [**Month (only) 958**].  He did not complain of any active chest
pain.

3.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient continued to do
well from a congestive heart failure point of view.  He had
his Lasix dose held and then reduced and appeared to do well
on the reduced dose of 60 mg po b.i.d.

4.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was held off his
Coumadin for gastrointestinal bleeding.  He also had his
pacemaker interrogated after having bradycardia down to the
30s one evening without pacemaker capturing.  The
electrophysiology team interrogated the patient and found
that the pacemaker's battery had about a four month life
left in the battery.  They adjusted the setting and
recommended that his batter be changed in two to three months
time.  At this time the patient is scheduled to have both his
cardiac catheterization and pacemaker battery changed on
admission to the hospital on [**2169-3-22**].

5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy:  The patient was continued
on Terazosin and Finasteride.

6.  Hypothyroidism:  He was known to have a normal TSH on the
last check.  This was recommended to be followed up was an
outpatient.

7.  Diabetes:  The patient was continued on regular insulin
sliding scale instead of his oral hypoglycemics due to his
diet changes in preparation for procedures.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA Services.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Digoxin 125 micrograms po q day.
2.  Pravachol 20 mg po q day.
3.  Finasteride 5 mg po q day.
4.  Multivitamins one cap po q day.
5.  Losartan 50 mg po q.d.
6.  Furosemide 60 mg po b.i.d.

12.  Glyset 25 mg po t.i.d.
13.  Terazosin 5 mg po q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Diabetes.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Atrial fibrillation with pacemaker.
4.  Coronary artery disease with a history of coronary artery
bypass graft in myocardial infarction.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
7.  Hypothyroidism.
8.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
9.  Acute blood loss anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding,
status post ileocecal artery branch embolization in [**2169-2-25**].

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on admission to the hospital on [**2169-3-22**] for cardiac
catheterization and pacemaker battery change.  In addition,
he may be evaluated for automatic implanted cardioverter
defibrillator at that time.  He is also to follow up in heart
failure clinic on [**2169-3-30**] at 1:30 p.m. with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Also he will have his creatinine checked on Friday [**3-3**] by
the [**Hospital6 407**] and the results of which will
be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24863**] to ensure that his creatinine does
not continue to rise upon discharge.  Also he will have
laboratories drawn on [**3-20**], which will be faxed to the
cardiac catheterization service in preparation for cardiac
catheterization.
