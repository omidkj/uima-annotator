Brief Hospital Course:
1) GI bleed:
Pt initially hypotensive in MICU. Her BP medications were held.
She was given IVFs and blood product, and she received a total
of 13 U blood in MICU.  Her INR was 2.7 on admission, and she
was given Vitamin K.  She was maintained on Heparin while her
INR was subtherapeutic. Once hemodynamically stable and HCT>30,
the pt began bowel prep for colonoscopy with GoLytely.  She
required 12L GoLytely to clear her black, tarry stool.  Once INR
was <1.6, the patient underwent GI procedures, to include
colonoscopy, EGD, and push enteroscopy.  These studies did not
show evidence of a bleeding source.  GI recommends a capsule
endoscopy as an outpatient. The pt remains on a PPI. By [**6-13**],
pt's HCT remained stable and she was transferred to the medical
floor.

2) ARF:
Pt's Cr on admission was 2.2, up from a baseline of 0.8. Digoxin
level was also elevated at 2.2.  Pt's Cr returned to baseline
after hydration/administration of blood prodcuts.

3) CAD:
As noted above, the pt underwent cardiac cath in [**3-15**] w/
placement of RCA stent. Cardiology was consulted, and the pt was
maintained on her ASA, statin, and Plavix.  During her MICU
stay, the pt had episodes of  chest pain with concurrent with
ST-T changes on ECG  but negative cardiac enzymes.  The angina
resolved following additional blood transfusion.  The pt
ultimately was placed back on her BB and ACEi.

4) Arrhythmia:
The pt had atrial fibrillation throughout her stay in the MICU
and was rate controlled primarily with IV lopressor.

5) CHF:
The pt's CHF was managed with IV lasix as needed. ECHO ([**6-4**])
disclosed an EF 45%. She was eventually placed back on her ACEi
and BB.  The Digoxin was initially held due to pt's acute renal
failure on presentation.  Level eventually normalized, and pt
was placed back on her Digoxin.

6) Anticoagulation:
The pt was transferred to the medical floor on [**6-13**]. She was
maintained on a Heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic.
