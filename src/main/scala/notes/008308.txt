Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
Pain, falls, failure to thrive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79 year-old Russian speaking gentleman with h/o
melanoma, left lung mass NOS (refused biopsy) HTN, COPD,
presenting from home with worsening pain in neck and shoulders,
confusion, and falls. Patient has presumed lung malignancy,
which was diagnosed in [**9-/2176**], however, diagnosis has not been
confirmed as patient refuses to have lung biopsy. Over the past
few weeks patient has had increasing neck and shoulder pain and
has had his fentanyl patch dose increased. His daughter noted he
was less active than he usually is at home, but today she felt
his mental status was back to baseline. He fell several times
yesterday. Today she discussed this with his primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] felt he needs to be in the hospital.

As per daughter patient had no fever, chest pain, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting. She thinks patient has
had recent weight loss
Vitals in the ER: 97.2 76 128/60 16 99% RA. He had CT head and
C-spine showing no acute fracture. He had a CXR showing known
cavitary lung lesion. He was given Morphine 2.5mg IV with
improvement in his pain; he also received 2L IVF, Zofran and
Clindamycin for ? lung abscess. He also received 2L IVF for
hypercalcemia. Patient was originally admitted to OMED service,
but while in the ED he converted from sinus rhythm to atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Patient initially
had HR in 160s. He received 15 mg IV diltiazem and his blood
pressure dropped to systolic BP of 80. He reecived an additional
1L NS and his SBP improved to 110s. He was started on diltiazem
gtt and transferred to ICU.

On arrival to the MICU, patient denies chest pain and shortness
of breath. His shoulder and neck pain are well controlled as
long as he does not move. He endorses recent 12 pound weight
loss. No fevers or chills. No nausea, abdominal pain. No cough.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGY HISTORY
79-year-old man with a history of COPD and a PET avid left upper
lobe nodule that has has grown since [**2173**], in the setting of
diffuse LAD. Mr. [**Known lastname 14535**] has had multiple conversations with
several pulmonary and oncology providers in the last several
years recommending tissue biopsy and bone marrow biopsy; but he
refused on multiple occasions. Noted to have LAD in [**2172**]; at
that time Heme-Onc was concerned for primary lung cancer versus
a potential lymphoma, less likely melanoma, and recommended a
bone marrow biopsy and a surgical biopsy, both of which Mr.
[**Known lastname 14535**] declined.
.
Imaging revealed growth of the spiculated LUL nodule [**2172**]-[**2175**]
to 2.4 cm, with osteolytic lesion in T5, T6, and posterior sixth
left rib thought to be likely mets. On [**2176-8-14**] CXR left upper
lobe lung nodule has grown to nearly 7 cm, abuts the anterior
surface of the left hilus; he refused biopsy again so his
pulmonologist obtained sputum sample.On [**2176-8-28**] sputum cytology
revealed highly atypical squamous
cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma. The patient has
refused biopsy and therefore is not eligible for any potential
treatments for this presumed malignancy

Past Medical History:
melanoma excised from his right thumb removed in [**2172**], no
pathology report
COPD
Bullous skin disease followed by Dermatology
HTN

Microbio:
Urine culture negative

Blood culture x 2: No growth to date

MRSA screen ([**6-6**]): Negative

Studies:
Head CT w/o Contrast ([**6-5**]):
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial process.
Prior right frontoparietal infarct.

Spine CT w/o Contrast ([**6-5**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute cervical fracture or malalignment.
2.  Multilevel severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine
as detailed
above.

CXR ([**6-5**]):
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a
previously 5.8 x 3.6 cm left upper lobe lung mass, now measuring
8.7 x 6.5 cm with interval cavitation and a new air-fluid level,
which presumably represents a cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma
with necrotic contents.  Superimposed infection cannot be
excluded.  This lesion abuts the anterior left hilus.  No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
silhouette is
normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
normal limits. The aortic knob is partially calcified without
dilatation.

CXR ([**6-7**]):
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-5**]:

Slight increase in the heart size and heterogeneous
opacification at the lung bases could be due to dependent edema,
but raises more concern for pneumonia.

The large cavitated mass in the left upper lobe contains a fair
amount of
fluid.  There is the possibility of internal aspiration.  No
pneumothorax or appreciable p
