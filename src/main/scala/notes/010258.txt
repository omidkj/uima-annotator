History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known firstname 14611**] is a 68-year-old woman, status post resection of an
intermediate grade meningioma followed by involved-field cranial
irradiation, who presents with seizures and was intubated for
airway protection.  Her meningioma was  resected in [**2117-10-7**],
and she was last admitted with right sided focal seizures from
[**2118-2-14**] to [**2118-2-16**] with no clear etiology.  The patient was
noted to have right sided focal seizures starting the night
prior to admission.  She was found by her husband with seizure
activity at 01:00 a.m.  She was given Ativan 0.5 mg at home, as
well as 1.0 mg by EMS on the way to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  She was
awake and verbal upon arrival to the [**Hospital **] Hospital.  At
[**Hospital **] Hospital, the patient was noted to have continued
seizure activity for 20-25 minutes.  She received Ativan 2.0 mg
x 2, Dilantin 1400 mg IV, Decadron 10 mg IV, 1.5L normal saline,
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

In the emergency department at [**Hospital **] Hospital, her initial
vital signs were 97.2 F, heart rate 109, blood pressure 139/86,
respiration 18, and oxygen saturation at 99%.  She was moving
all 4 extremities, but was minimially responsive, significantly
altered, and not clearly protecting her airway.  She was
intubated for airway protection and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.

On arrival, the patient was intubated and sedated.  She
continued to move all 4 extremities and was not responsive to
commands.

Past Medical History:
- Meningioma: In [**9-17**] presented with right sided numbness and
weakness.  MRI showed a left parafalcine mass with surrounding
vasogenic edema. Resection of the mass on [**2117-10-7**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] showed atypical meningioma WHO grade II with 40%-50% MIB-1
positivity. She then underwent involved-field cranial
irradiation with 6000 cGy over 30 fractions ending [**2118-1-26**].
- Bilateral hip replacement
- Varicose vein ligation
- Cataract surgeries OU
- Removal of a hemangioma from the right middle finger
- DVT right leg [**10-18**], s/p warfarin therapy x 6 months
- Arthritis
- Cesarean Section
- Osteoporosis
- Hyperlipidemia
- Seizures

Social History:
She lives with her husband.  She has two grown children.

Family History:
- Mother:  Died of rutptured aortic aneurysm age 46.

88.


Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.6 F, pulse 97, blood pressure
115/68, respiration 22, oxygen saturation 98% (ventilator
setting AC, TV 500, RR 16, PEEP 5, and FIO2 60%)
GENERAL:  Intubated, sedated
SKIN:  No rashes or skin breakdown
HEENT:  ETT in place, neck supple
CARDIOVASCULAR:  RR, NL S1S2 no S3S4 MRG
PULMONARY:  CTAB anteriorly
ABDOMEN:  She has diminished BS, soft, NTND, no masses or HSM,
no stigmata of chronic liver disease
LIMBS:  No lower extremity edema, + dorsalis pedis pulses

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is
50.  She is awake, alert, and able to follow simple commands.
Her language is fluent with fair comprehension.  Cranial Nerve
Examination:  Her pupils are equal and reactive to light, 4 mm
to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are full; there is
no nystagmus.  Visual fields are full to confrontation.  Her
face is
symmetric.  Facial sensation is intact bilaterally.  Her hearing
is intact bilaterally.  Her tongue is midline.  Palate goes up
in the midline.  Sternocleidomastoids are strong but the right
upper trapezius is weak.  Motor Examination:  She has a drift on
the right side.  Her muscle strengths are [**2-11**] at proximal right
upper extremity and 4-/5 distally in right handgrip.  The left
upper extremity strength is [**4-13**].  The right lower extremity has
1/5 strength, while it is 4+/5 in proximal left lower extremity
and [**4-13**] at distal left lower extremity.  Her reflexes are 3+ at
the right upper extremity, 2- in the left upper extremities, 3+
at the right knee, and 2- at the left knee.
Her ankle jerks are absent.  Her right toe is up while the left
is equivocal.  Sensory examination is notable for decreased
touch in right lower and right upper extremities.  Coordination
examination reveals dysmetria commensurate with her weakness on
the right side.  She cannot walk.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL:  Now alert and oriented x3, good air entry
with mild crackles, improving voice. Otherwise not significantly
changed.

EEG [**2118-7-5**]:
This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to generalized
slowing, as well as runs and bursts of theta and delta slowing,
indicative of a moderate to severe encephalopathy which could be
due to
ischemia, infection, or mass among other etiologies. Generalized

superimposed beta activity was seen, likely due to a medication
effect,
most commonly from benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Generalized
beta
activity was best seen over the left frontotemporal region
likely due
to the skull defect. Additional bursts of beta activity were
seen in
the cardiac monitor which, at times, correlated with left
frontotemporal
beta activity likely due to artifact. There were no clear
electrographic seizures.

EEG [**2118-7-6**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to
generalized
slowing, with continuous theta and delta slowing, which are much
more
prominent than the previous day's recording, with occasional
brief
periods of generalized suppression. These findings are
indicative of a
severe encephalopathy which could be due to ischemia, infection,
or
toxic/ metabolic disturbances and medication effects, among
other
etiologies. It is also abnormal due to occasional sharp and slow
wave
discharges in the frontal regions and, at times, with a
generalized
appearance which can represent potentially epileptogenic cortex.

Generalized superimposed beta activity was seen, likely due to a

medication effect, most commonly from benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
There were no clear electrographic seizures.

EEG [**2118-7-7**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to
generalized
slowing, with continuous theta and delta slowing, similar to
yesterday's
recording with occasional brief periods of generalized
suppression.
These findings are indicative of a severe encephalopathy, which
could be
due to ischemia, infection, or toxic/metabolic disturbances, and

medication effects, among other etiologies. It is also ab
