Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-9-8**] Urgent Four Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting on
IABP(left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending,
with vein grafts to diagonal, obtuse marginal, and PDA)
[**2120-9-13**] Tracheostomy


History of Present Illness:
This 86 year old female who presented to MWMC with severe chest
pain.  Her EKG revealed ST depressions in V2 - V4 and she ruled
in for an NSTEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed severe triple vessel coronary artery disease and
severely depressed LV function(EF 20%).  An IABP was placed and
she was started on Heparin.  She was urgently transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for surgical management. On admission, she was pain-free.

Pertinent Results:
[**2120-9-8**] Intraop TEE:
Pre-CPB:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 - 35%). There is inferior, posterior, and
infero-septal akinesis, with hypokinesis of all other segments.
There is moderate global RV hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  There is
no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on no inotropes. Overall biventricular
systolic fxn is preserved with an EF of 34 - 40%. 2+ MR, trace
AI. Aorta intact. IABP remains in good position.

[**2120-9-17**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
inferior wall and hypokinesis of the inferoseptum and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40 %). Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4223**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. She remained pain
free on IABP and intravenous therapy. On [**9-8**], she
underwent urgent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  For surgical details, please see operative note. Following
the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. Postoperative course will now be broken down by
systems:

CARDIAC: IABP was removed on postoperative day one but required
prolonged period of inotropic and pressor support. Transfused
with packed red blood cells to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
Started on Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation with eventual
conversion back to a normal sinus rhythm.

PULMONARY: Extubated on postoperative day one but experienced
prolonged period of hypoxia. She was received steroids,
round-the-clock nebulizers, and was aggressively diuresed. She
did not require re-intubation but did require intermittent
BiPAP. On postoperative day six, chest x-ray notable for
worsening right upper lobe consolidation worrisome for
aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was subsequently
started on Vancomycin and Cefepime.  After multiple failed
attempts at extubation a tracheostomy was performed.  With time
she weaned to CPAP settings.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Initial leukocytosis with left shift. With
no clear etiology, other than steroids, empiric antibiotics were
discontinued. Antibiotics were eventually resumed for hospital
acquired pneumonia. Also started on Fluconazole for yeast in the
urine.

RENAL: Gradual decline in renal function requiring dialysis.

GI: GI bleed post-operatively requiring multiple transfusions
and eventual celiac/SMA/[**Female First Name (un) 899**] angiography and coil.

NUTRITION: Given prolonged period of cardiogenic shock and poor
respiratory status, she was started on tube feedings on
postoperative day four.

NEUROLOGY: Awoke neurologically intact.

Due to Ms. [**Known lastname **] poor prognosis, multiple discussions were
held with her family regarding withdrawal of care.  Initially it
was decided that she would be sent home for hospice, but when
she was unable to be transported home her family decided to
withdrawal care in-house.  She expired on [**2120-10-19**].
