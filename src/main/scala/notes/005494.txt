Admission Date:  [**2142-11-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-11-17**]

Date of Birth:                    Sex:  F

Service:  Neurology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 75-year-old
right-handed female with a history of hypertension who was
found to be unconscious on the ground on the morning of
admission date.  She was last seen two days prior to
admission.  Neighbors found piled up magazines and newspapers
from the day prior to admission.

Due to the patient's state of consciousness, review of
systems, past medical history, medications, allergies, social
history, and family history could not be obtained.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure was
140/72.  Intubated on synchronized intermittent mandatory
ventilation.  The patient could not breathe over the
ventilator.  The neck felt supple.  No carotid bruits.  Head
was atraumatic.  Pulmonary and cardiovascular examinations
were unremarkable.  The abdomen was soft and nondistended.
No cyanosis or skin rash could be witnessed.  The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale was 6 (eyes 1, verbal 1, and motor 4).
The patient's eyes were closed.  Did not open with noxious
stimulation or command.  Bilaterally present corneal reflex.
Did not respond to visual threat.  Funduscopic examination
was difficult because of small pupils.  The pupils were equal
in size at 1.5 mm and reactive bilaterally.  Nystagmus was
not present.  No gaze preference or eye deviation.  No
grimace after noxious stimulation of the periocular notch.
Gag reflex was absent.  Oxycephalic  testing was negative.
Motor examination showed withdrawal response present in all
limbs except for the left arm.  On sensory examination,
.................... posturing could be seen after noxious
stimulation.  The patient withdrew with her legs when
stimulated.  No response when the left arm was stimulated.
The reflexes were symmetric.  No clonus was present.  The
toes were upgoing bilaterally.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  White count was 19.1.  Urinalysis
with over 50 white blood cells.  INR was 2.4.  Creatine
kinase was 1445.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, a magnetic resonance imaging
showed a large right-sided intraparenchymal bleed with
midline shift.

The patient was admitted to the Neurology Service, and her
neurological status was monitored every hour in the Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient received Dilantin intravenously in
order to prevent seizures.  Her blood pressure was monitored.
She received mannitol to reduce the brain edema.  The
Neurosurgery Service was urgently called upon for consult,
and they suggested no further neurosurgical intervention at
that time.

Despite blood pressure controls, and mannitol treatment, and
therapy for her urinary tract infection, the patient's
neurological status deteriorated consistently, and she was
found to be posturing on [**11-15**].  Her chest x-rays
showed signs of pneumonia as well.

On [**11-15**], the patient's brother was [**Name (NI) 653**], and a
meeting was conducted with him.  The patient's code status
after this meeting was changed to do not resuscitate/do not
intubate.  The patient continued on mechanical ventilation,
and regular blood gases were obtained to assess adequate
oxygenation.

On [**11-16**], the patient's neurological status had
deteriorated significantly and she had no response to
stimulation.  The Neurosurgery Service was re-consulted, and
they strongly discouraged any surgical intervention at that
time.

On [**11-17**], the patient expired.
