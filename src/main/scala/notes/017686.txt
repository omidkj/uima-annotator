Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Neurontin / Prozac

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**7-26**] Cardiac Catheterization
[**7-28**] Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 3 (LIMa to LAD, SVG
to Ramus, SVG to OM)

History of Present Illness:
53yo gentleman with h/o CAD (2 vessel disease of LCx and
co-dominant RCA), mild systolic CHF (EF 45%), and DM2
transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] with NSTEMI.
Patient reports stuttering exertional and non-exertional chest
pain for anywhere from days to months, depending on the
interviewer. He had dismissed the pain as being due to acid
reflux. Of note, he had stopped taking many of his cardiac
medications (including plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and
imdur) without discussing the matter with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] finally
came into the hospital at [**Hospital3 **] because his pain did not go
away after a few days despite taking antacids. He also admits to
doing 4 lines of cocaine 2 days prior to presentation. During
his initial work-up at [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have ST
depressions in V5 and V6 with troponin of 3.1, at which point he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. He received ASA, plavix 300mg, and
lovenox and was on a nitro gtt prior to transfer. He was also on
an amiodarone gtt for reported frequent ectopy.
In the ED, his initial VS were: 97.2 146/85 25 95% 4L. He was
having mild chest pain and frequent runs of NSVT. Cardiology was
consulted for positive biomarkers. He was put on an integrillin
gtt and given morphine and zofran for symptom management. He
also received lasix 40mg IV x 1 because of evidence of heart
failure on exam.

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI ([**2175**]) and multiple overlapping DES to LCx ([**2176-8-5**])

HTN
Hyperlipidemia--no LDL, HDL available at [**Hospital1 18**]

DM2--no A1C available
Nocturia
Hepatitis C--no viral load available
Chronic back pain s/p laminectomies, rod placement d/t
injury--on chronic methadone

Social History:
Social history is significant for the presence of current
tobacco use: he has smoked [**1-15**] PPD x "all my life". There is a
history of alcohol abuse in the past; he has been sober x 8
years. He admits to using 4 lines of cocaine 2 days ago.

Family History:
There is a family history of premature coronary artery disease
in his grandmother and aunt.

Physical Exam:

Gen: Overweight gentleman in significant distress from pain and
anxiety. Oriented x3. Anxious. Somewhat circuitous with answers.

HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 8-10cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Somewhat distant heart sounds, normal S1, S2. No S4, no S3.

were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. ? crackles at bases
b/l, though patient has difficulty staying still for exam
secondary to pain. No wheeze.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness. No abdominial
bruits. Femoral sheath in place with IABP.
Ext: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+; Femoral sheath in place; DP dopplerable
Left: Carotid 2+; Femoral 1+ without bruit; 2+ DP

Pertinent Results:
EKG (06:39) demonstrated NSR with normal axis and good R wave
progression. T wave flattening in aVL and III that is old as
compared with prior dated [**2176-8-16**].
EKG (08:28) as above with frequent PVCs.
EKG (16:19) NSR with normal axis and T wave flattening in aVL,
III, ? ST depressions in V4 and V5.
QTc in all EKGs is prolonged, ranging up to 477ms.

[**7-26**] Cardiac Cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this
co-dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA had mild disease.  The LAD had a 60-70%
proximal tubular lesion.  The LCX was subtotally occluded with
diffuse in stent restenosis and thrombosis.  The RCA was
distally occluded and filled by collaterals. 2.  Limited resting
hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated left sided filling
pressures with LVEDP of 45 mm Hg.  There was no gradient upon
pullback of the catheter from LV to the aorta.  There was mild
systemic arterial hypotension of 94/65 mm Hg. 3.  Left
ventriculography was deferred. 4.  Successful insertion of IABP.

[**7-28**] Echo: PREGrafting: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with dyskinesis of the inferolateral wall,
hypokinesis of the distal anterior and anterolateral walls..
LVEF ~25-30%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The MR
increased to (2+) moderate during manipulation of the heart
during off pump CABG. A well positioned balloon pump catheter is
seen in the descending thoracic aorta. Post Grafting: 1+ mitral
regurgitation seen post-grafting. Aortic balloon pump catheter
remains in descending thoracic aorta just distal to the
subclavian artery. LV function and wall motion appears mildly
improved. (EF 30-35%.) The distal anterior wall appears to be
improved. Previous wall motion abnormalities persist. Remaining
exam is unchanged from pre-grafting.
