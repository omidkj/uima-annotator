CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxia and acute respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 32 year old
male with a history of asthma who presents with acute
respiratory distress.  The patient has had symptoms of upper
respiratory infection/bronchitis for approximately two weeks
prior to admission and was reportedly using escalating doses
of bronchodilators.  The patient then presented to the
Emergency Department and was found to be "blue" and was
emergently intubated.  After intubation, gas was 7.13, 76,
246.  In the Emergency Department, the patient had received
Ketamine, Morphine, Versed, Magnesium, and bronchodilators.
The patient was difficult to ventilate requiring very high
driving pressures and was therefore paralyzed with much
improvement.  Vent was set at SIMV tidal volume 600,
respiratory rate 10, PEEP 5, and 60% FIO2 on admission to the
Fennard Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma.  The patient has been
hospitalized in the past but history is unknown.  Outpatient
regimen is unclear.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Albuterol MDI.

ALLERGIES:  Unknown.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Primary language is Portuguese. No immediate
family in the U.S.  The patient's family all lives in [**Location 4194**].
The patient immigrated from [**Country 4194**] one month prior to
admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed blood pressure
111/54, heart rate 95, oxygen saturation 98% on 60% FIO2,
temperature 97.2 rectally.  In general, the patient is
intubated and sedated.  The heart is slightly tachycardic,
normal S1 and S2.  Lungs - diffuse high pitched inspiratory
and expiratory wheezes bilaterally.  Prolonged I:E ratio.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologically, moving all four extremities and is sedated.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 29.0, hematocrit
49.0, platelets 470,000, 24% polys, 47% lymphocytes, 0 bands,
6% monocytes, 21% eosinophilia.  Chem7 was within normal
limits.  Serum toxicology was negative.  Urine toxicology was
nasogastric.  Arterial blood gases after intubation 7.13, 71
and 246.

Chest x-ray - no infiltrates and no effusions.  Endotracheal
tube five centimeters above the carina.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 32 year old Portuguese
speaking male with a history of asthma who presents with
hypercapnic respiratory arrest.

1.  Pulmonary - asthma - Complicated by hypercapnic
respiratory arrest.  The patient was placed on maximum
sedation with Propofol which was eventually changed to
Fentanyl and Ativan.  The patient no longer needed to be
paralyzed after adequate sedation was given.

The patient was started on Albuterol MDI two to ten puffs
q15minutes p.r.n. and was started on Solu-Medrol 80 mg
intravenously q8hours.  The patient was also empirically
started on Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. with a history of upper
respiratory infection, bronchitis type symptoms.  A sputum
sample was sent which was positive for Hemophilus influenzae.

The patient still required intubation several days into
admission.  Therefore, Aminophylline drip was started.
Serevent, Combivent and Flovent were added to the patient's
regimen.  On [**2173-3-15**], the patient's Aminophylline drip was
discontinued.  Serevent, Flovent and Combivent were
discontinued and the patient was maintained on Albuterol MDI
and steroids.  The steroids were tapered.

The patient extubated himself on [**2173-3-17**], and A line was
discontinued.  The patient required q4hour meter dose
inhalers on [**2173-3-17**].  The patient was transitioned to
Albuterol, Flovent and Serevent meter dose inhalers and was
started on p.o. Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q.d.  The patient
was continued on Levaquin for Hemophilus bronchitis.

The patient had a blood culture that was positive for gram
positive cocci, two out of two blood cultures.  The patient's
A line was discontinued and surveillance cultures were sent
which were negative.  Blood cultures from [**2173-3-15**], finally
grew out coagulase negative Staphylococcus which was thought
to be a contaminant.  No antibiotics were started for this at
this time.

2.  Constipation - The patient had constipation secondary to
Fentanyl drip.  The patient was started on a bowel regimen
and Lactulose.

3.  Communication -  The patient is Portuguese speaking only
and the patient's past medical history was unclear.  However,
after speaking to the patient through a translator, it
appears that he is allergic to "narcotics" although it was
unclear what this meant.  The patient denies any other
allergies.

After extubation, the patient was directly discharged from
the Fennard Intensive Care Unit after he was monitored for
one day.  The patient's breathing and asthma symptoms
improved with treatment.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status asthmaticus.
2.  Bronchitis.
3.  Positive blood cultures most likely secondary to
contamination.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Albuterol MDI.
2.  Flovent MDI.  The patient was given Flovent inhaler,
however, was prescribed Azmacort since this is what is
available at free care pharmacy.
3.  Serevent inhaler.
4.  Prednisone taper.
5.  Levaquin to complete a ten day course.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable to home.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 40643**] [**Name (STitle) **]
one week after discharge and then will follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] a month after discharge.
