History of Present Illness:
This is a 63yoM w/h/o 4V CABG in [**4-21**] and PUD who is transferred
from OSH for management of severe pancreatitis and STEMI. Hx is
per pt's family as pt is intubated and sedated. Per pt's wife,
pt had been feeling well but "tired" the past couple of days.
His wife notes that this AM, he awoke, ate breakfast w/o
difficulty/complaint, and worked on the computer as he usually
dose. They had a plan to meet at the mall. The pt's wife drove
away and noted that the pt was not getting in his car. About an
hour later, she got a call from him saying that he felt
terrible. When she arrived at home, he was on the bathroom floor
having vomited. She noted that he was responding appropriately,
but slurring his speech. She then called EMS and they took him
to the OSH. Per EMS record, vitals en route to OSH: HR 40, BP
90/palp, sat 89% RA. He was given 1 dose of 0.5mg atropine IO
w/improvement of HR to 50s.

There, pt was afebrile; he was IVF resuscitated w/5L NS which
resolved pt's intial hypotension to 70s/40s. Labs revealed
amylase 4313, libpase >[**Numeric Identifier **], ALT 178, AST 148, Cr 2.1, WBC
12.0, HCT 47.2; 1st set CK 261 MB 2 TNI <0.10, 2nd set CK 89 TNI
<0.10.   When he presented at the OSH. He had no further
episodes of bradycardia. He  and given Levofloxacin 750mg IV x
1, morphine and dilaudid for pain. He was noted to have
intermittent ST elev 1 mm in II/III/F. ABG was 7.25/44/188 on
NRB.

KEY RADIOLOGY STUDIES:
[**2183-11-10**] ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: Limited exam given body habitus.
No focal liver lesion is identified. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The common duct measures 3 mm.
The gallbladder is contracted and thus difficult to evaluate for
the presence of stone. The portal vein is patent with the
hepatopetal flow. The splenic vasculature is not examined. The
pancreas is obscured by bowel gas. The right kidney measures
10.0 cm. The left kidney measures 11.0 cm. There is no
hydronephrosis or ascites.
IMPRESSION: Limited exam shows no focal liver lesion or
intra/extrahepatic
biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is contracted and thus
difficult to
evaluate for the presence of stones.

[**2182-11-14**] ABDOMEN, SUPINE: No dilated loops of large or small bowel
present and there is no evidence of obstruction. Nasogastric
tube is present, curled up within the upper abdomen.

[**2182-11-15**] ABDOMEN, SUPINE: No evidence of obstruction.

[**2182-11-18**] CT ABD W/ CONTRAST:
1. There is extensive pancreatic necrosis, with only minimal
residual
enhancing pancreatic tissue in the region of the head and
uncinate process.  Fluid interdigitates with retroperitoneal and
mesenteric fat. A small amount tracks inferiorly into the
paracolic gutter and into the pelvis. However, there is no
drainable fluid collection at this time.
2. Gallstones.
3. Bilateral small effusions and consolidation/atelectasis.

[**2182-11-30**] HEAD CT:
1. Right frontal and right parietal hypodensities appear to
represent infarct of unclear chronicity, but possibly subacute.
Recommend MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging for further
evaluation.
2. Near complete opacification of the sphenoid sinus with
opacification of
multiple posterior ethmoid air cells. Opacification of multiple
right mastoid air cells also observed.
ADDENDUM: The right frontal hypodensity is associated with local
tissue loss, and is therefore chronic. The right parietal low
density region has no tissue loss and may be subacute.

[**2182-12-2**] CAROTID US: read pending
.
[**2182-12-3**]: ECHO (Transthroacic) with bubble study)
Technically suboptimal study due to very poor acoustic windows.
Suboptimal saline contrast did not demonstrate a right-to-left
shunt. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are grossly normal (LVEF>50%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic is dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets are grossly
normal without definite mitral regurgitation. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
