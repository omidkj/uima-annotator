Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Iodine; Iodine Containing

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Gram negative bacteremia and fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Staging laparoscopy.
2. Pylorus-preserving Whipple resection.
3. Open cholecystectomy.
4. Jejunostomy-tube placement.
5. Placement of CyberKnife fiducial seeds.


History of Present Illness:
This delightful and energetic 85-year-old woman recently
presented to our Medical Center with fever and bacteremia. She
was worked up, and found to have a
mass in her left upper quadrant. This ultimately figured to be a
diverticular abscess that resolved with antibiotic care.
However, in the workup of this, an incidental finding of a
pancreatic head mass was noted on an abdominal CT. This was
biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma by an endoscopic ultrasound.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease with history of angioplasty in
[**State 108**] one year ago
2. Mitral valve prolapse
3. Atrial fibrillation
4. Hyperlipemia
5. Hypertension
6. Chronic kidney disease (SCr 2.1 in [**3-17**])
7. Hypothyroidism? (TSH 10 in [**3-17**])
8. Anemia (HCT 30.7 in [**3-17**])

Social History:
The patient lives alone in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], which has an indoor pool and
denies having any stairs. She is a widow and lives alone.
Prevsiously smoked (30 pack-years) and rarely drinks a small
amount of wine.


Family History:
Father had a GI tumor, primary unknown.  Daughter with breast
cancer.  Another daughter with ovarian carcinoma.  Granddaughter
with celiac disease.  No family history of inflammatory bowel
disease.

Physical Exam:
General:  An 85-year-old woman in a wheelchair, does not appear
to be in acute distress, however, was worried because when she
tried to get on to the bus today, her right leg gave out and
since then she feels her right leg is slightly weak.  This is
unusual from before.
Vital Signs:  Blood pressure was 160/80, pulse is 72, weight of
165 pounds.
HEENT:  EOMI, PERRLA.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Tympanic
membranes visualized bilaterally.
Neck:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy felt.  No bruits noted.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, could not hear any
murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Respiratory:  Clear bilaterally.  No added sounds heard.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, bowel sounds are present.
Extremities:  Mild edema present in the left lower extremity,
especially in the ankle area.  No calf muscle tenderness noted.
Musculoskeletal:  Range of motion was intact in upper and lower
extremities.
Central Nervous System:  Power was [**4-12**] both upper and lower
extremities.  Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.  The patient
did
have difficulty getting up from the wheelchair and could not get
up from the wheelchair without using the support of the arms of
the wheelchair.  She did have a little weakness while getting up
from the wheelchair on to the examination table for her right
leg.

[**2140-5-29**] Chest and abdominal CT:
1. Interstitial changes of the lung apices with additional
patchy
consolidation. Recommend clinical correlation for pneumonic
consolidation.
2. Post-surgical changes associated with prior Whipple's
procedure. Loculated fluid in the surgical bed and surrounding
the mesenteric root could represent postoperative seromas; very
early fluid collections could appear similarly.
3. Large subacute hematoma in right subcutaneous fat, subjacent
to the skin staples.
4. Mild periportal edema.

[**2140-5-19**] Pathology:
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Gallbladder, jejunum, panceatic head mass.
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Gallbladder (A): Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.
2.  Pancreatic head mass, Whipple procedure (B-O): Pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma with secondary involvement of the
duodenum; see synoptic report.
3.  Jejunum (P-Q): Small intestine, within normal limits.

Gross: The unfixed specimen is received in three containers each
labeled with the patient's name "[**Known lastname 426**], [**Known firstname 730**] S" and with the
record number.

Part 1 is additionally labeled "gallbladder".  The specimen
consists of a distended gallbladder that measures 9 x 4.8 x 2.7
cm. The cystic duct is identified and is probe patent. No cystic
duct lymph node is identified. The gallbladder is opened and
contains approximately 25 mL of light green viscous bile in
addition to numerous soft and fragmented gallstones of the mixed
type, which measure up to 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The mucosa of the
specimen is velvety and bile stained. The gallbladder wall
measures up to 0.2 cm in thickness.  No discreet masses or
lesions are noted. The specimen is represented in A.

Part 2 is additionally labeled "pancreatic head mass". The
specimen consists of a pancreatico-duodenectomy specimen that
measures 9.5 x 7 x 3 cm overall. The pancreatic portion is
composed of a pancreatic head that measures 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm.
There is an attached portion of duodenum that measures 10 cm in
length, with an average diameter of 2.5 cm. The specimen is
oriented as follows: blue stitch = pancreatic duct, long silk =
bile duct, long gree stitch = SMA margin. The pancreatic duct is
dilated up to 0.5 cm, and it is not probe patent. The common
bile duct is identified and is probe patent. The common bile
duct is opened along its length to reveal unremarkable bile duct
mucosa. The specimen is inked as follows: blue = pancreatic
parenchymal margin, [**Location (un) 2452**] = uncinate process margin, yellow =
posterior retroperitoneal margin. The duodenum is opened along
the anti pancreatic surface to reveal grossly unremarkable tan
duodenal mucosa. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a
poorly demarcated white firm area that measures 2.5 x 2.3 x 1.5
cm. This area extends to within 1.0 cm of the posterior
retroperitoneal yellow inked margin. It also grossly appears to
extend to within 0.2 cm of the duodenal mucosa. The specimen is
represented as follows: B = common bile duct margin, C =
pancreatic parenchymal margin, D = uncinate process margin, E =
proximal duodenal margin, F = distal duodenal margin, G =
ampulla, H = duodenum, I-N = white firm area in relation to
surrounding structures, O = remainder of peripancreatic adipose
tissue.

Part 3 is additionally labeled jejunum. The specimen consists of
a segment of small bowel that measures 19 cm in length, with an
average diameter of 2.3 cm. The specimen is unoriented and both
small bowel margins are closed with staple lines. The specimen
is opened along the antimesenteric surface to reveal
unremarkable small intestinal tan mucosa. The specimen is
represented as follows: P = small bowel margins, Q = grossly
unremarkable
