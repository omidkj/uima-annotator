agitation, vision loss

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66yo man with a history
of ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on dabigatran,
diabetes mellitus (history of poor glycemic control), tobacco
abuse, hyperlipidemia, alcohol abuse and prior stroke who
presents to the ED by EMS today after a change in his mental
status. We are able to obtain limited a history by a combination
of sources including the patient's daughter, EMS personnel.

The patient has been in his USOH. He is retired and lives at
home, and is unmarried. His kids visit him from time to time.
His
daughter reports that he drinks alcoholic beverages everyday and
is an active smoker. Apparently, he had been complaining about
asthma symptoms more recently. They spoke with him this morning
around 11AM. Later in the afternoon, around 4PM, his son visited
with him and they spent some time together, and had a couple of
beers for Father's day. After returning from the bathroom, he
had
a sudden change in his mental status. All of a sudden, he
started
to scream and complain of difficulty breathing. He seemed
confused. EMS was called, and transported him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

Initial ED physical examinations were concerning for a toxic
metabolic encephalopathy, and routine bloods were largely
unrevealing. He appeared confused and disoriented and was not
able to provide any type of a coherent history. Language was not
the problem here: his knowledge of English was quite reasonable.
Later, it was noticed that he was having difficulty seeing.
Neurology was called.

A complete review of systems was above, a more thorough ROS was
not able to be obtained

Neurologic examination (limited)
- Mr. [**Known lastname 22771**] was awake and alert and made poor eye contact. [**Name (NI) **]
appeared agitated at times and confused. He was able to tell me
his name, but could not recall his age, home address, name of
this country, the President, the date or the reason why he was
in
the hospital. He could tell me that he was from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**]
originally. He could not recall what he ate for lunch earlier
that day, nor could he name his [**Hospital1 **] names.
- PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus on command, he had difficulty
tracking objects and performing smooth pursuit. He had a dense
visual field cut on the left. Objects placed on the right side
of
his vision would be seen and recognized easily, and he often
neglected the left side of his world. No asymmetries in facial
movement or sensation.
- Full strength in all major muscle groups tested with diffusely
increased tone. Symmetrically poor reflexes (he would not relax
for a proper reflex examination).
- Sensation was grossly intact bilaterally, although he had
definite double simultaneous extinction to stimuli on the left
(by sensory).
- Could not test typical cerebellar tests at the bedside, gait
examination was deferred.

Physical Exam on Discharge:
Patient is oriented to self, hospital, [**Hospital1 18**], [**Location (un) 86**], says it is
"[**2175-9-25**]," repetition intact, names low and high
frequency objects, visual fields difficult to assess but has
some deficit on R, tongue protrudes midline, motor [**5-29**] in UEs
and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/l, sensation intact to light touch throughout, finger
to nose intact

DISCHARGE LABS:
??????????????????

CT head [**2184-7-11**]:
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CTA [**2184-7-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Likely old lacunar infarcts involving the right basal ganglia
region and left pons.  No evidence of acute territorial infarct.

2. Significant motion degradation of CTA making it impossible to
rule out
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 22776**] [**Last Name (un) 22777**], aneurysm or dissection.  Please consider use
of sedation and repeat the exam  if clinically indicated.

CT [**2184-7-12**]:
IMPRESSION:  Evolving bilateral occipital infarctions, larger on
the right than the left, in the regions of the bilateral PCAs.
There is mild associated mass effect with effacement of the
adjacent sulci, but no evidence of herniation.  No hemorrhagic
conversion.

EEG [**7-12**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG during brief wakefulness and
sleep,
because of mild background slowing indicative of a mild diffuse
cerebral
dysfunction of nonspecific etiology. No epileptiform discharges
or
electrographic seizures are present. Note is made of an
irregularly
irregular cardiac rhythm as well as wide-complex premature beats


Transthoracic echo [**7-12**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen in
the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic d
