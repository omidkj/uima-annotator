FOOT AND LOWER LEG, FIVE VIEWS
FINDINGS: Comparison [**2191-8-8**]. An external fixator device has
been placed around the lower leg and foot. Evaluation of the
osseous structures is severely limited due to the overlying
hardware. Extensive post-operative changes of the hindfoot are
seen. A bone stimulation device is also noted. Lucent tracts in
the osseous structures reflect previous hardware. Evidence of
previous distal fibular resection is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of external fixator device.
Extensive post-operative changes of the lower leg and hindfoot.
Evaluation is obscured by the overlying device.
.
ANGIO for PICC placement: IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a
42 cm long single lumen line placed via the left brachial vein
with tip in the distal SVC. The line is ready for use.
