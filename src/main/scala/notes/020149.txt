CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right pleural effusion.

For complete history and physical, please refer to the notes
written by Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2153-11-25**].

In brief, the patient is a 63-year-old woman who has
undergone a combined liver, kidney transplant who has had
recurrent right pleural effusions that had been managed by
repeat thoracenteses.  She is currently in the hospital for
management for urinary tract infection and has planned to
undergo an umbilical hernia repair by the transplant service.
They have asked if we would consider performing a talc
pleurodesis in the same setting.

I discussed with the patient the anticipated procedure.  We
reviewed the possibility that lung may not expand and a
decortication may be required.  We also discussed the
possibility that the effusion may recur despite pleurodesis.
We also discussed other risks of the operation and include
bleeding, infection, pneumonia, and death.  She is willing to
proceed and we will schedule for surgery for tomorrow [**2153-11-28**].
