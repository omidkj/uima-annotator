Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2042**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
56F h/o metastatic melanoma s/p resection of parietal masses,
whole brain radiation, currently on decadron taper found to be
hypotensive to 80s with increased lethagry and weakness at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Sent over by ambulabnce, SBP 70s per EMS. + cough
x 3 days. No fevers, chills, n/v, abd pain, diarrhea. s/p
radiation [**2104-4-4**]. Decreased appetite. Recent Admission from
[**Date range (3) 87289**] for bilateral lower extremity weakness
(inability to ambulate) and LUE clumsiness due to hemorrhage
into known brain mets. Treated with whole brain XRT after prior
stereotactic treatment. Discharged to rehabilitation.
.
In the ED initial VS significant for BP 84/53, T 101.3. Exam
significant for guiac positive brown stool.  Labs significant
for left shift, Hct 26 (down from 42 on [**4-14**]) lactate 3.5.  CXR
showed persistent LLL opacity, ? atelectasis.  CT abdomen pelvis
showed no acute process. Consulted GI, who thought GI source
unlikely for such a large hct drop without sx.  Given vanc/zosyn
empirically for sepsis, CVL (RIJ triple lumen) placed and
started on levophed. Hydrocortisone 100mg IV given.

Past Medical History:
Metastatic Melanoma diagnosed in [**2102**] status post...
--[**8-/2102**] Resection of initial back lesion
--Axillary lymph node dissection

Brain MRI [**2104-3-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval hemorrhage in left frontal metastatic lesion, with
worsening surrounding edema.
2. Worsening dural nodularity and enhancement along the left
frontal convexity, concerning for progressive dural metastasis.

3. Interval development of leptomeningeal enhancement in the
left frontal and parietal lobes at the vertex, likely
leptomeningeal metastatic disease.
4. Right frontal and parietal lobe enhancing lesions, are
stable-to-slightly decreased in size, with mildly decreased
surrounding edema.
.
[**2104-4-20**] pCXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a
pre-existing right pleural effusion has minimally increased in
extent. No left pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumonia. No
pneumothorax.
.
[**2104-4-19**] LUE ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous
thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
.
[**2104-4-18**] LENI's: IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusive thrombus within the entire left superficial
femoral, popliteal, peroneal, and posterior tibial veins with
nonocclusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein.
2. Nonocclusive thrombus within the right superficial femoral
vein in its mid and distal portions which has a subacute or
chronic appearance, but is new since [**2103-11-2**].
.
[**2104-4-18**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-17**], the
vascular congestion seen on the prior study appears to have
decreased. The hemidiaphragms are not wellseen. This could be a
technical artifact or reflect small pleural effusions with
associated atelectatic change. Enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette persists.
.
[**2104-4-18**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
[**2104-4-17**] Abd/Pelvic CTA: 1. No explanation for patient's drop in
hematocrit. There is no intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal
hematoma, and no evidence of active extravasation into the
gastrointestinal tract.
2. Innumerable hypodense liver lesions, progressed in size and
number
compared to [**2104-2-25**], compatible with metastases from
known melanoma.
3. Asymmetric opacification of the left common femoral and
distal external iliac vein relative to the right is concerning
for DVT. Ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.
4. Bilateral renal cysts.
5. Small nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with associa
