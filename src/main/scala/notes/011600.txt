CT HEAD [**10-9**]
FINDINGS:  Changes of a right craniotomy and cranioplasty are
again noted
without significant interval change.  The prosthesis appears to
be in
satisfactory position.  Significant encephalomalacia of the
right temporal
lobe with extension into the right frontal and parietal lobes is
again seen, compatible with evolving hemorrhage.  Although minor
artifact from the presence of aneurysm coils limits full
evaluation, there is no evidence for acute hemorrhage.  Local
sulcal and ventricular effacement persists without significant
change.  There is no significant shift of the midline
structures.
IMPRESSION:  Right frontotemporoparietal encephalomalacia
without evidence for acute hemorrhage.

Carotid US [**10-10**]
CONCLUSION:  Less than 40% stenosis in the right internal
carotid artery, less than 40% stenosis in the left internal
carotid artery.

CXR [**10-10**] PA and Lateral
Comparison is made with prior study, [**2148-9-20**].
Now mild interstitial edema has markedly improved.  Left lower
lobe
retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis is improved.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  The aorta is tortuous.
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Improved now
very mild interstitial
pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumonia.

[**2148-10-14**] TEE
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS:
Intact thoracic aorta.
The aortic mechanical prosthesis is stable andf unctioning well
with a residual mean gradient of 12 mm of Hg across the valve.
Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF 55%.
No new findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52932**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2148-10-8**] for further
evaluation of her chest pain. As she was known to the cardiac
surgical service, cardiac surgery was consulted to see if she
was a surgical candidate at this time. The neurosurgery service
was consulted and she was cleared for anticoagulation and
surgery. A CT scan of her head showed right
frontotemporoparietal encephalomalacia without evidence for
acute hemorrhage. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner. A dental consult was obtained who recommended
extractions prior to surgery. Dental extractions (teeth numbers
1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 30) was performed on [**2148-10-12**].
On [**2148-10-14**], Ms. [**Known lastname 52932**] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent replacement of her aortic valve. Please see operative
note for details. Postoperatively she was take to the intensive
care unit for monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support. She remained hypotensive, requiring volume
and A-pacing.  She was transfused one unit of packed red blood
cells.  Beta blocker was eventually initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. INR was allowed to drift down to <1.8 and then
pacing wires
