Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18369**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
femoral line placement
PICC line placed by IR
port removal by general surgery

History of Present Illness:
this is a 74yo F w/ metatstatic sarcamatoid kidney cancer to L1,
T9, pelvic bone, liver, lung, skull currently undergoing
chemotherapy, Addison's on prednisone and recent hospitalization
for hypotension and fever, now admitted for fever to 102 in last
24hrs. 2 days prior to admission, she reports that she felt well
and had been afebrile but then progressively became more
confused w/ increased tenderness near her port site. She denies
any cough, SOB, CP, N/V, diarrhea, HA or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **]
called ambulance yesterday when he noticed change in pt's MS.
.
Since admission, she was found to have elevated lactate levels,
and port site noted to have purulent drainage. This was removed,
and empiric abx were started - given cefepime, vanc, and flagyl.
Fem line was placed as pt has difficult access. Pt's blood cx
has grown out GPCPC, and she was continued on vancomycin. She
defervesced quickly, and has remained afebrile for 24hrs. She
has remained hemodynamically stable, and she is being
transferred to the floor for further management.

Past Medical History:
1. Addison disease diagnosed at 37 years of age.
2. Hypercholesterolemia, on Lipitor in the past. The patient
recently stopped the Lipitor, which resulted in improved kidney

function, which allowed her to enter the chemotherapy trial.
3. Hypotension.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. COPD.
6. Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral carotid stenoses
status post TIA. In [**8-/2103**], the patient had left upper
extremity weakness and slurred speech with complete resolution
in
less than 24 hours.
7. Coronary artery disease (1 vessel). The first cardiac cath
in [**8-/2103**] showed total occlusion of right coronary artery. PCI

failed at that time. However, there were significant
left-to-right collaterals. Second cardiac cath in [**12/2107**] showed

no progression of her coronary artery disease. 60% diag, 40%lad

8. Preserved EF in past--echo [**2103**]-50%, cath showed normal index
in [**2107**] and RVG [**2108-3-28**] recently with ef of 72%
9. Osteoporosis, on Fosamax for 2 years and then on Forteo for 2

months, which she stopped at the end of [**Month (only) 359**]. Status post
undisplaced pathological fracture of her right pelvis, both
inferior and superior rami in 09/[**2107**].
10. Metastatic sarcomatoid kidney cancer.
11. Right ear deafness.
12. RAD


Social History:
The patient used to smoke a pack and a half since [**17**] years of
age until 65 years of age. She does not drink alcohol. She is a
widow. She has 6 children and 18 grandchildren. She currently
lives with her son and his family. She used to work as a
waitress and then she had an office job.


Family History:
One brother died at a young age probably secondary to Addison
disease. One brother has prostate cancer. One daughter has
melanoma. Her father had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer. Two brothers have
coronary artery disease. There is no history of
osteoporosis in her family.

INDICATION: Addison's disease and metastatic sarcomatoid kidney
cancer, now with fever.

COMPARISON: Four previous chest radiographs including [**4-10**], [**2108**] and
[**2108-4-16**].
FINDINGS: There is a new right central line, the tip overlying
the distal SVC. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart size and
mediastinal contours are stable. There are bilateral linear
interstitial markings consistent with CHF on a background of
emphysema. Left upper lung mass is partially obscured by the
scapular shadow, but persists. Cholecystectomy clips and left
upper abdominal curvilinear calcifications are better seen on
today's exam.
IMPRESSION: CHF on a background of emphysema.

vegetations.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 74 year-old woman with metastatic
sarcamatoid kidney cancer, Addison's disease, admitted with
fever and hypotension likely from port infection. Port removed
by general surgery on admission - blood cx from admission
growing MSSA, with last positive blood culture [**2108-4-30**].  Port
cath tip growing MSSA.
.
# GPC/MSSA sepsis: Port is likely source of infxn given
purulence when it was examined in ED; was improving initially
after starting on vancomycin. Transitioned to PO prednisone from
stress-dose steroids on admission. MSSA organism initially
treated with vancomycin, now transitioned to IV Cefazolin 2g
q12h per Infectious Disease consultant recommendation (increased
from 1g IV). TTE to eval for vegetation in setting of gram
positive sepsis was negative; TEE was performed also confirming
no endocarditis.  The pt will continue IV cefazolin 2g IV q12h
until seen by ID ([**2108-6-6**]) by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  She is to have
weekly CBC with diff, LFTs drawn and faxed to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (see
prescription for outpt lab work).  She is to continue prednisone
5mg po bid until seen by her oncologist (see follow up appt).
She remains afebrile, with port site without erythema,
induration or drainage.  The site is non-painful and appears to
be healing well.  Her stress dose steroids were tapered to po
prednisone, and she will continue with 5mg po bid on discharge.
.
# Elevated WBC ct, persistent during admission: No clear source.
 Last positive blood culture was [**2108-4-30**].  UA negative with neg
Urine cx.  Stool is Cdiff negative X 2.  TEE was negative for
valvular lesions.  Pt continues to be afebrile.  VSS. A RUQ
ultrasound was ordered to assess for RUE DVT, and was negative.
Blood cultures were checked qd and her last positive blood cx
was [**2108-4-30**].  She will continue IV Cefazolin until seen by
Infectious Disease as an outpt.
.
# Hypotension, resolved: At baseline, BP fluctuates given hx of
Addison's. However, considered other etiologies for hypotension
- sepsis, adrenal insufficiency (s/p IV steroids tapered to po
prednisone), cardiogenic given cad history (unlikely),
hypovolemia/bleeding - hematocrit drop likely secondary to
fluids. BP increased during her admission so pt restarted on
outpt BP regimen (ACEI, BB, [**Last Name (un) **]). At discharge, her blood
pressure was within the normal range on her antihypertensive
