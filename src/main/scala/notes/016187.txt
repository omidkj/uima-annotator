Service:  Neuro ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73-year-old man
with past history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, coronary artery disease status post MI ten years
ago, and COPD who was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital with a large left
thalamic bleed found on head CT at that outside hospital.  At
approximately 3:30 a.m. on [**12-5**] he noticed some right sided
weakness.  At about 5:30 a.m. he tried to get up from bed but
found he could only sit at the edge of the bed.  He woke his
wife and told her that he was unable to get up.  She reports
that his right side appeared weak at his leg and his arm and
that he could answer her coherently but could not form his
own sentences, that his words came out gibberish.  She gave
him a sublingual Nitroglycerin and called 911.  At that time
he slid off his bed but remained alert, responsive and moving
his left side only.  He was taken by EMS to [**Hospital 16843**]
Hospital Emergency Room where he was found to be alert,
following commands with slurred speech and not moving his
right arm and leg.  He gradually became less verbal, became
agitated, combative and stopped following commands.  He
received a small amount of sedation, was intubated for airway
protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].  At [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital he was found to have an INR
of 4.2.  On transfer to [**Hospital1 **], the INR was repeated and found to
be elevated at 5.  He received Vitamin K and received FFP for
a total of 6 units.  His blood pressure initially was found
to be elevated up to 220.  He was started on Labetalol drip
and Nipride drip for blood pressure control.  He also
received 4 mg of Ativan while in the Emergency Room here.  On
head CT he was found to have a large intraparenchymal left
thalamic/basal ganglia hemorrhage with intraventricular
extension, slight subfalcine herniation and 1 to 2 mm midline
shift.  The intraventricular blood predominantly involved the
left lateral ventricle with a small amount of blood seen
within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle as
well as in the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and third ventricle.  Also
seen was an area of hypodensity within the right temporal
lobe consistency with an old infarct and a large calcified
right frontal convexity meningioma measuring 2.8 cm.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam on admission blood pressure
ranged from 220 down to 132/70's to 80's, heart rate 70's to
80's and atrial fibrillation.  The patient was intubated,
breathing at a rate of 10 and he was afebrile.  The patient
was intubated and sedated.  Head was normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Neck was supple without bruits.  Cardiovascular,
he had irregularly irregular S1 and S2 with no murmurs.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally on anterior exam with
quiet breath sounds.  Abdomen was obese, soft, nontender.
Extremities, no edema.  Neurologic exam, patient did not open
his eyes to voice or painful stimuli, he did not follow
commands.  He was moving his left face, arm.  He did have
spontaneous movements of the left face, arm and leg.  There
were no spontaneous movements on the right side with the
right arm and leg flaccid.  There was withdrawal to painful
stimuli on the left arm and leg.  He grimaced to painful
stimuli on the right lower extremity.  There was no response
to pain on the right upper extremity.  Cranial nerves, pupils
1.5 mm bilaterally and both sluggishly reactive on the right.
There was spontaneous conjugate gaze to the left with a left
gaze preference but the eyes were able to go to the right
with Doll's eyes.  There was positive corneal reflexes
bilaterally, positive cough and the patient was found to be
breathing at a rate over the set rate of the ventilator.
Reflexes, he was hyporeflexic throughout with a right upgoing
toe.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission INR 5, PTT 42, white count
12.0, hematocrit 45, platelet count 147,000.  Electrolytes
unremarkable.  BUN, creatinine 26/1.2.

PCP is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37133**], [**Name Initial (PRE) **].D. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37134**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the neuro ICU.
Blood pressure was controlled with Labetalol drip to maintain
systolic blood pressure 140's to 160's.  He was given FFP for
a total of 6 units to reverse elevated INR.  Head of bed was
kept 30 degrees.  Frequent neuro checks were done to watch
for any sign of hydrocephalus.  He was placed on gentle
hydration with IV fluids at 50 cc per hour.  He was evaluated
by neurosurgery who felt that his intraparenchymal bleed was
not operable.  Throughout his hospital course his neurologic
exam did not significantly change.  He remained with flaccid
right arm and leg and with good spontaneous movements on his
left arm and leg.  He remained intubated and sedated.  The
sedation was withdrawn on [**12-7**] with no significant change in
his neurologic status or responsiveness other than opening
his eyes to stimulation.  Repeat head CT was done on [**12-6**] to
evaluate for any change in hemorrhage or mass effect or
hydrocephalus.  Repeat head CT showed a stable hemorrhage
with no significant change from the prior study.  It
continued to require aggressive blood pressure control.  He
again had a repeat head CT done on [**2147-12-10**] for question of
decreased responsiveness and again no significant change was
seen in the hemorrhage or small amount of shift.  His
ventilatory requirements continued to be weaned.  He was
weaned to pressure support and C-pap, though continued to
require intubation for airway protection.  After discussion
with the family it was decided to place tracheostomy as well
as PEG tube which was done on [**12-18**].  He did become febrile
over his hospital course with cultures showing an
enterococcus UTI and MSSA in his sputum.  He was started on
antibiotics including Levaquin and Oxacillin.  He received a
total course of a 7 day course of Levaquin and is to continue
for a total of 7 days of Oxacillin requiring one more day, to
be discontinued after [**12-22**] dose.  He did have an episode of
acute respiratory distress on [**12-19**].  At that time the
episode resolved spontaneously.  Chest x-ray at that time
showed mild CHF, the episode was felt to possibly be a PE.
Lower extremity dopplers were done which were negative.  The
patient had been on boots for DVT prophylaxis and was started
on subcu Heparin.  Neurologic exam on discharge remained not
significantly changed.  The patient is awake, alert, opens
eyes to verbal stimuli.  He does not follow commands.  he
does squeeze with his left hand but not consistently to
command.  He continues with a left gaze deviation, both eyes
sometimes do cross midline.  He does not track with his eyes,
his pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  The left
gaze deviation is able to be overcome by dolls.  He continues
with a dense right hemiplegia.  He has good spontaneous
movements on the left arm and leg.  He withdraws his left arm
and leg to painful stimuli.  There is occa
