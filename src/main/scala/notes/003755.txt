History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 21 y.o. man w/ a history of AIHA s/p splenectomy
([**3-/2194**]) on prednisone, PE and portal vein thrombosis (on
warfarin), and IgA deficiency, who presented with 3 days of
nausea/vomiting and suprapubic/LLQ pain accompanied by dark
urine. He noted that his vomiting began 3 days ago at night. He
did not see what his vomit looked like at that time. He then had
another episode the next morning, which he said appeared
"brown." Altogether, he notes vomiting more than 10 times in the
last three days, with some of the vomit appearing to be
"coffee-ground" in nature. He felt as if having a bowel movement
would make him feel less nauseous, but he had one earlier today
but it did not help him. He said his stool was hard, brown, and
non-bloody.

One day ago he began having LLQ/suprapubic pain which was
stabbing in nature and would radiate to his back and left flank.
He would not be able to get comfortable due to this pain, which
he said would range from [**2192-4-16**].  He said in this setting his
urine began looking like "cola," and it would hurt him when he
urinated. He noticed what looked like blood in his urine as
well.

Of note, he was healthy until [**9-/2193**], when he visited [**Hospital1 **] to see a friend who just had a child and was noted to
be jaundiced and unsteady. He was found to be profoundly anemic
and was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Coombs+) and
IgA deficiency. He underwent a splenectomy 4/[**2193**]. He developed
chest pain in [**4-/2194**], and he was found on OSH imaging to have
bilateral PEs and portal vein thrombosis. He was also treated
for pneumonia in this setting.

He has been chronically SOB, especially on exertion, noting that
he can only walk up 1 flight of stairs or walk about 20 yards
without needing to rest. He says he wheezes in the setting of
exertion. He has had chest pain ever since his PE diagnosis in
[**Month (only) 116**], although the pain has decreased since then.

He also noted fevers, chills, 50-60 lb weight gain since
beginning prednisone in [**9-/2193**], weakness since beginning
prednisone. He has chronic headaches. He denied dizziness and
lightheadedness.  He takes "8 tylenol on average" per vascular
surgery note.

He originally presented to [**Hospital3 **], where WBC 65.5 and
Hct 19.5.  11% bands, 5% metamyelocytes, 122 nucleated RBCs. He
received a CT abdomen/pelvis, which found persistent
non-occlusive extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis, R hepatic
lobe intrahepatic portal vein thrombosis, L renal swelling, fat
stranding, and perinephric fluid.  L mid-hydroureter w/ the
distal L ureter appearing relatively collapsed. No apparent
ureterolithiasis.  He received hydrocortisone, ondansetron,
Zosyn, and ceftriaxone. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further management.

In the ED, initial VS were: T 97.2, HR 90, BP 144/88, RR 18,
O(2)Sat: 98%. WBC 26.5, HCT 18.6, ALT 51, AST 166, LDH 4070,
Tbili 2.8, and Dbili 1.0. Haptoglobin <5. U/A significant for
WBC 47, RBCs 36, but negative nitrite, trace leukocyte esterase,
few bacteria, 0 epis. Hematology was consulted and recommended
1mg/kg solumedrol, PPI, checking H.pylori, giving 5 mg folate
QD, IV heparin, and bone marrow bx/aspirate.  Vascular surgery
was consulted and recommended a renal US. A preliminary read of
a Renal US indicated L renal vein thrombosis. Urology was
consulted and did not feel that there was a focal arterial
process to intervene upon.

On arrival to the MICU, T99, HR 112, BP 117/68, RR 26, 94% on 2L
NC. He was fatigued but not in any apparent distress. He was
started on vancomycin/cefepime for his suspected pyelonephritis
and ordered for 2U packed RBCs.
