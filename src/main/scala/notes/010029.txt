History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 45-year-old right-handed woman with a history
of bipolar disorder, tobacco abuse, and cocaine abuse who
presented to the emergency with a one-month history of
neurological symptoms.

Her symptoms began one month ago when she suddenly started
seeing ??????rainbows?????? in her field of vision.  She describes the
sensation as round spots of different colors that came in
bursts.  These bursts of colors were located throughout all
regions of her visual field.  The bursts would last for a few
hours at a time and then go away.  She had several episodes of
these bursts each week.  She never experienced any loss of
vision or blindness.  The bursts did not change when she covered
either eye, and they persisted even when both her eyes were
closed.  The colors seemed to be worse when she was exposed to
light; in particular, she thought they were brought on by her
stepping out into the sunlight.  The only thing that seemed to
improve her symptoms somewhat was applying cold rags to her
eyes.  She has had some difficulty with blurry near vision over
the past month and noted that she also had trouble seeing her
big TV from several feet away; she never experienced any
blindness or double vision.  She denied seeing any people,
animals, or other objects and only ever experienced rounded
bursts of different colors. She denied bumping into things while
walking around.  She had no headache, weakness, numbness,
tingling, changes in smell or taste, out-of-body sensations, or
unusual movements associated with the color bursts.   She had
only a single episode of nausea and vomiting associated with the
color burst.  She never lost consciousness.  She has never had
any symptoms like this before.  About two weeks ago, the color
bursts stopped appearing and have not appeared since that time.

Shortly after the color bursts subsided, she developed a new
headache.  The onset of the headache was gradual and started on
the left temporal aspect of her head. Initially it was about
[**5-31**] in intensity but it gradually grew worse over the next two
weeks and at the time of presentation was [**12-1**].  She described
the pain as sharp, constant, and unremitting. She denied any
throbbing or pulsing quality. The pain was worse when she was
supine and when she coughed or sneezed, and it occasionally woke
her from sleep.  She had no nausea or vomiting but did endorse
photophobia and phonophobia. She tried acetominophen and
oxycodone, and while these gave her some minor relief the
headache always returned.  In the past she has very rarely had
headaches, and those generally lasted no more than 30 minutes.
The only other symptom associated with the headache was that one
day she was paying her mother??????s bills and kept making
mathematical mistakes, which she does not usually do; she also
noted at this time that she seemed to be putting her rings on
the wrong fingers.  She denies confusing left and right and says
that her emotional state has not changed from her baseline.  She
describes this headache as very different from any headache she
has ever had before. Initially it did not radiate but on the day
before presentation it spread over to her right temple, which
prompted her to seek medical attention.

Review of systems is remarkable for unintentional weight loss of
25 pounds over the past few months, occasional night sweats and
chills, and a recent dental extraction for an infection in her
upper teeth. Last cocaine use was two days prior to
presentation.  She denies cough or shortness of breath and notes
no swelling in her neck, under her arms, or in her groin.
