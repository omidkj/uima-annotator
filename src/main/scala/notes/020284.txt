CT guided abscess drainage


History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 69-year-old male who has had several episodes
of idiopathic pancreatitis. The previous summer, he was found to
have a 5 x 3 cm mass in the
pancreatic body, which was biopsied by ultrasound guidance.
This aspiration revealed unremarkable ductal cells and Strep
and E. coli. It  was decided that the patient would best undergo

resection of the pancreatic mass on [**6-6**].  His post
operative course
was complicated by  a Pulmonary embolus.  He also has had
postoperative fluid collections in his pancreas and a low output

fistula measuring at most 40 cc of pus-type fluid a day.  Most
recently, the patient presented to [**Hospital6 **] with
a fever to 103, runny nose,
cough, nausea, shortness of breath.  He had a CT scan done at an

outside facility that demonstrated a subdiaphragmatic abscess on

the left which was bilobed and measturing 9.8 x 6.3 cm in size.

This is contiguous with a focal collection along the pancreatic
remnant measuring 5.8 x 5.1 cm.  He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
drain placement for the fluid collection  on [**2124-7-31**].  He
was discharged to home on [**2124-8-7**] in stable condition
with a drain in place and on antibiotics.  The patient now
returns with increased drainage around the drain, without other
symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, chest pain, or shortness of breath.

Brief Hospital Course:
Once the INR level was subtherapeutic, the patient underwent
another CT guided drainage of abscess. Clinically, the patient
output from the drain looked suspicious, and it was decided that
it would be best to drain the abscess in the or. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**]t an exploratory laparotomy with drainage of subphrenic
and subdiaphragmatic (left) abscess on [**2124-8-16**]. The patient
underwent Mobilization and takedown of the colonic splenic
flexure, extended colectomy with primary anastomosis, extensive
lysis of adhesions, creation and mobilization of omental pedicle
flap. Postoperatively, the patient continued to receive
antibiotic linezolid and was started on levaquin/flagyl. Patient
initially improved, but had a code purple on POD 5. Pt was
evaluated by psychiatry in house and though the psychosis, and
disorientation that was thought to be multi-factorial. On POD
12, the patient began to be tachypneic and decrease 02 sat. Pt
was transferred to T/SICU for more monitored care. Repeat CT
scan showed a new fluid collection in the abdomen which was
subsequenty drained and new pulmonary embolus -- RLL. Pt was
started on heparin, and antibiotics were continued. The new
fluid collection was drained by CT guided draiange. In addition,
blood culture illustrated klebsiella bacteremia for which he was
treated with miropenen. Pt continued to improve in the T/SICU
and was weaned from the VENT and started on TPN. Pt was
transferred to the floor with two drains on the left side. On
POD 19, the pt accidently pulled the pigtail catheder and began
to take pos. Physical therapy begain to work with the patient
and assist with balance after a prolonged hospital admission.
Patient was continued on Heparin and is awaiting
antiocoagulation by coumadin. Pt was treated with a total of
mirponen 14 days, linezolid 22, and flagyl 24 days. Patient
continued to do well, until one day prior to discharge.
patient's tpn was stopped and did not take po for lack of
appetite. Pt had two episodes of emesis 500-100cc, but was
otherwise clinically stable. Patient underwent a repeat CT scan
and picc was placed for TPN prior to discharge to rehab
facility. CT showed improvement in abscess and pt began to
tolerate a house diet. Patient is going to rehab center and will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in 2 weeks.
