Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Oxycontin / Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
"swollen tongue"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
LP x2


History of Present Illness:
74 yo F with chronic low back pain s/p multiple procedures,
urinary incontinence, and dementia who presented to the ED with
tongue swelling after falling onto her face. Per report she was
walking and fell forward. No apparent LOC or preceeding
symptoms. She appeared to loose her balance. She sustained a
right orbital hematoma and bit her tongue. She did not require
sutures. She is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for airway monitoring
given her swollen tongue.
.
She was seen at [**Hospital3 **] today for a pre-op assessment prior
to a urinary sling procedure. Her husband reports increasing
confusion and frequent falls over the last two weeks. She was
treated for a UTI with Amoxicillin 1 month ago. He reports she
is forgetful at baseline. She has been on several different
medications for urinary incontinence over the last 2 yrs
including detrol and vesicare. Her recent confusion appears to
correlate with starting Vesicare on [**2102-2-21**]. She also
discontinued her fluphenazine on [**2102-3-9**] after 40 yrs of use.
.
In the ED a Head CT revealed chronic microvascular angiopathy
without acute fracture or hemorrhage. Her UA was negative.
.
She is alert and oriented to self only. She denies pain,
dysuria, or SOB. Husband reports her wt has been stable and she
has a good appetite.

Past Medical History:
- ?dementia
- urinary incontinence since [**2099**]
- chronic low back pain/degenerative disk disease s/p failed
back surgery, epidural steroid injections, nerve blocks, facet
injections, trigger point injections

- major depression

Social History:
She lives at home with her husband. She is independent of her
ADL's. She quit smoking tob in [**2049**]; ~10 pack year history.
Occasional EtOH. Denies illicit drug use. Husband, [**Name (NI) 892**] [**Name (NI) 3647**],

.
[**3-13**] ECG: Sinus rhythm
Prior inferior myocardial infarction
No previous tracing available for comparison
.
[**3-13**] CT Head: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Chronic microvascular angiopathy.
3. Right supraorbital facial swelling.
4. No fracture identified.
.
[**3-13**]: CT C-spine: No evidence of acute fracture or listhesis.
Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
.
[**3-13**] CT Orbits/face: 1. Soft tissue swelling over the right
orbit.
2. No evidence of acute fracture. Note added at attending
review: There is a fracture of the tip of the coronoid process
of the right mandible.
.
[**3-14**] MRI Head: Significantly limited MRI of the brain due to
motion artifact. Extensive chronic periventricular microvascular
ischemic changes. Scattered old lacunar infarcts within the
brainstem. No acute territorial infarcts are seen within the
brain.
.
[**3-30**] Most recent head MRI:
This study, slightly degraded by patient motion artifact, is
compared with recent contrast-enhanced MR examination dated
[**2102-3-20**]; the overall appearance is unchanged. There is
mild-moderate cortical atrophy. There is severe, confluent
FLAIR-hyperintensity in bihemispheric periventricular and
subcortical white matter, representing extensive chronic
microischemic change. However, there is no focus of restricted
diffusion to indicate acute infarction. There is no evidence of
acute hemorrhage. There are a few punctate foci of blooming
susceptibility artifact, unchanged, likely representing
hemosiderin from past petechial hemorrhage, related to small
vessel infarction. Again noted is a prominent developmental
venous anomaly ("venous angioma") in the right paramedian
cerebellar vermis, with no associated cavernous angioma or
hemorrhage. There is no other pathologic focus of parenchymal,
leptomeningeal or dural enhancement.
IMPRESSION:
1) No acute process and no significant interval change since the
[**3-20**] examination.
2) Severe chronic micro-ischemic change in bihemispheric white
matter.
3) Extensive fluid within bilateral mastoid air cells,
significantly worse since the previous examination, and
bilateral ethmoid mucosal thickening with small amount of fluid
in the sphenoid sinus, some of which may relate to protracted
supine positioning (is there clinical suspicion of either
sinusitis or mastoiditis?).
.
CXR [**2102-4-11**]:
The heart size is moderately enlarged, unchanged. There is a
prominent mediastinal venous engorgement with no overt pulmonary
edema.
Bibasilar mild atelectasis are unchanged.
The tracheostomy and the right subclavian venous line are in
good position, stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 3647**] was initially admitted to the medicine ICU for
observation given her chronic tongue swelling and fall on her
face with trauma. She was monitored overnight on standard ICU
monitoring and a 1:1 sitter with no problems or events. Dementia
work up was initiated, and she completed an MRI of the head. The
dementia workup was negative and the MRI (limited study) was
significant for no acute stroke. The pt was noted to have
extensive chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic changes
and scattered old lacunar infarcts within the brainstem. The
pt's electrolytes were checked and repleted. She was disoriented
throughout her stay, and agitated and somnolent at times. She
was stable the day after admission morning, and transferred to
the medical floor as she had a stable respiratory status, and
did not require ICU level care any longer. On the morning of
transfer to the floor the pt has a CT head that showed an
isolated fracture of her mandible. The pt was evaluated by the
oro-maxillofacial surgery service from the [**Hospital1 756**] and no
intervention was recommended. The pt became increasingly
somnolent on arrival to the floor and had decreased
responsiveness. She became mildly rousable on her third day on
the floor. The pt was noted to be hyperventilating. Due to
concern for altered mental status secondary to
meningitis/encephalitis, an LP was attempted by the Anesthesia
team and house staff. Due to the pt's multiple back surgeries
and spine fusions, an LP was not successful. The pt was
empirically started on Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Acyclovir and
Ampicillin. A day after initiation of these medications, there
was an interval increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 2.2. Due to
concern for Vancomycin or Acyclovir induced nephrotoxicity,
these medications were held and Cr was rechecked; it
