Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
77 yo male with CAD s/p CABG and stents, pacemaker (with recent
revision in [**State 108**] [**2143-3-22**]), chronic hypoxia on home 6L 02
[**1-2**] obesity and low DLCO as well as COPD, DM2, PVD who presented
with several days of worsening dyspnea.  He also notes increased
bilateral leg swelling and abdominal swelling over this same
timecourse.  Denies recent fever, rhinorrhea, cough, sick
contact, chest pain, nausea, headache, confusion. However, he
does notes that from the time he got on the airplane on Thursday
through Saturday he did not have any oxygen at all.  He reports
that his insurance company denied compressed portable 02 for him
despite his pulmonologist in FLA writing them a letter.  His
wife noted that the whole weekend the patient appeared short of
breath and slightly blue around the lips but that he refused to
come into the hospital until this morning.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were initally notable for 02 in
the 70s on 6L.  Patient appeared cyanotic and tachypneic and
lungs diffusely wheezy with some crackles.  Labs notable for a
normal CBC and electrolytes except creatinine of 1.3 (1.2 in
[**Month (only) 404**]). Troponin - x1. U/A negative. BNP 1312.  Patient had
LENIs which were negative. CXR showed pacer leads intact,
mild/mod pulm edema, LLL consolidation likely atelectasis,
cannot rule out pneumonia.  Patient was given IV methylpred,
Levofloxacin and 40 IV lasix and diuresed about 1.5L.EKG showed
pacing spike. VS on transfer: 97 70 131/59 20 on NRB 95% RA.

Past Medical History:
#.  Coronary artery disease with bypass surgery in [**2126**],
circumflex stenting in [**2133**] and rotational atherectomy in [**2136**]
with inability to deliver a stent.  His most recent coronary
angiogram in [**2138**] showed diffuse moderate disease, not suitable
for further intervention.  Left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure was elevated to 24 mm.
#.  Exertional dyspnea, which was felt to be multifactorial with
a role of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction along with
known
restrictive pulmonary disease and obesity.
#.  Placement of a permanent pacemaker in [**State 108**] in [**2140-10-1**] for high-grade AV block and revision [**3-/2143**] to 3 lead pacer
#.  Hypertension.
#.  Hyperlipidemia with most recent lab studies at [**Last Name (un) **] in [**2142-3-31**] showing total cholesterol 132, LDL 71, HDL 49 and
triglycerides 151.
#.  Difficult to control diabetes.
#.  Obesity.
#8.  Vascular disease being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with no
further
interventions felt appropriate at the time of his last visit.
# spinal stenosis,
# colon polyps,
# Chronic renal insufficiency s/p renal stent in [**2131**]
# obstructive sleep apnea,
# diabetic retinopathy,
# cataracts

PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A biventricular pacemaker device
is new
compared to prior examination. The triple leads are intact and
project over the expected location of the right atrium, right
ventricle, and coronary sinus. Median sternotomy wires appear
grossly intact on this frontal projection. Bilateral
interstitial opacities, septal thickening, and perihilar
haziness are findings consistent with new mild-to-moderate
pulmonary edema. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles,
left greater than right, is likely secondary to pleural
effusions. There is no definite focal consolidation or
pneumothorax. Increased density at the lung bases may be
secondary to pleural fluid or partial atelectasis. The cardiac
silhouette is mildly enlarged.
IMPRESSION:
1. New mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, likely cardiogenic
etiology.
2. New bilateral effusions, moderate on the left and small on
the right.
3. Possible partial bibasilar atelectasis
4. Intact pacemaker leads with standard position.
Bilateral LENI: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the examined
veins. Evaluation of the peroneal veins
could not be completed.
CHEST (PA & LAT): In comparison with the study of [**4-12**], there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated
pulmonary
venous pressure in this patient with pacemaker device in place.
The
opacification at the left base has somewhat decreased,
consistent with
re-aeration of much of the left lower lobe and decreased
effusion.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM WITH BUBBLE STUDY:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. At least moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. Due to the technically suboptimal nature
of this study, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and
severity of pulmonary hypertension may be grossly
underestimated. There is (at least) moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. No
obvious intracardiac shunt detected by agitated saline contrast
imaging (on very suboptimal views)
.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic
study with agitated saline contrast is recommended.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal ima
