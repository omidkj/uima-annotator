Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Gastrointestinal bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TIPS
Endotracheal intubation
Placement of central venous catheter

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 63 y/o female with UC s/p colectomy and colostomy
20 yrs
ago and recently diagnosed cirrhosis after a variceal bleed in
early [**Month (only) 547**] requiring ICU stay and a total of 11 units of PRBCs.
She presented at that time with bright red blood in her ostomy.
The bleeding was eventual stopped when the surgery team put
sutures in an actively bleeding vessel at the ostomy site on
[**2133-4-26**]. Afterward, a tagged RBC scan failed to reveal any
extravazation of blood. GI scoped the ostomy and found no
further sites of bleeding. She was discharged home on [**2133-5-2**]. 5
days ago she had the sutures removed from her stoma. She now
represents with recurrent bright blood in her ostomy starting at
11 PM last night. She reported lightheadedness at the time of
the bleeding. She denies CP, SOB, N/V, hematemesis, abdominal
pain, fevers. She [**Last Name (un) 25177**] had a mild nose bleed. She was taken to
[**Hospital3 **] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In ED at [**Hospital1 18**] she
was transiently hypotensive to SBP 70s. She received 7 Liters
normal saline and 2 units PRBCs. NG lavage in ED negative.
Currently she complains of chills, but denies lightheadedness,
SOB.

Pertinent Results:
TIPS procedure:
After risks and benefits were explained to the patient and
patient's family, written informed consent was obtained. The
patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. The
bilateral necks were prepped and draped in the standard sterile
fashion. A preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm the
patient's name, procedure, and site. Using sterile technique,
general anesthesia, and local anesthesia, an access was
established to the right internal jugular vein using
ultrasonographic guidance and micropuncture site. The access
site was dilated and a 10-French vascular sheath was placed over
the wire with the tip positioned in the superior vena cava under
fluoroscopic guidance. A 5-French modified C2 catheter was then
advanced through the sheath over the wire with its tip engaged
into the hepatic vein under fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter
was then advanced distally and venogram was performed. The
catheter was then exchanged for a balloon occlusion catheter
over the wire and CO2 portogram was performed after inflation of
the balloon. This was done in the frontal and lateral
projections. The portogram confirmed the position of the balloon
catheter within the right hepatic vein. A TIPS puncture site was
then advanced through the sheath into the hepatic vein and the
branch of the right portal vein was entered after several
attempts with the needle. A guide wire was then advanced into
the main portal vein and a multihole straight catheter was then
placed over the wire with the tip in the main portal vein.
Pressure gradient was measured at the main portal vein, which
was 34 mmHg. The venogram was performed through the catheter,
which demonstrated multiple large collateral vessels. The liver
parenchyma track was dilated with an 9-mm balloon with an
inflation pressure up to 12 atm. A 10 mm x 94 mm Wallstent was
then deployed, extending from the main portal vein into the
hepatic vein. The stent was then dilated with 10-mm balloon.
Pressure gradient decreased to 2 mmHg between the portal vein
and the right atrium. The catheter was then repositioned into
the main portal vein and followup venogram was performed. This
demonstrated patent shunt, and decreased collateral vessels. The
catheter and the sheath were then withdrawn into the IVC and
then removed. Hemostasis was achieved by direct manual pressure
for 15 minutes.
By the request of anesthesiologist, a triple-lumen central line
was placed before the procedure through left internal jugular
vein. The tip of the catheter is within the superior vena cava.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
immediate complications.
IMPRESSION:
1. Successful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
placement with reduction of a pressure gradient between portal
vein and right atrium at approximately 2 mmHg after the TIPS
placed.
.
F/u Day 1 post-TIPS Doppler U/S:
FINDINGS:
The liver is normal in size, no focal lesions. No intrahepatic
biliary dilatation. The TIPS stent is demonstrated between the
posterior branch of the right portal vein and right hepatic
vein. The stent appears patent with wall-to-wall flow on color
Doppler. Doppler interrogation along the stent shows a velocity
of 71 cm per second in its proximal portion, an elavated
velocity of 210 and 256 cm in the mid portion and 142 cm at the
distal end. These velocities above 200 cm per second require
close followup.
Main portal vein is patent with a velocity of 41 cm per second.
There is normal hepatopetal directional flow in the main and
right portal vein towards the TIPS stent.
Inferior vena cava appears patent on color Doppler as is the
right hepatic vein. Normal arterial waveform in the left hepatic
artery.
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites around the liver in the
right upper quadrant.
CONCLUSION:
1. Patent TIPS stent with expected hepatopetal directional flow
in the main portal vein. Elevated velocities in the mid portion
of the TIPS stent over 200 cm per second. Short interval
followup with Doppler is advised.
2. Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
.
F/u Day 3 Post-TIPS Doppler U/S:
TIPS ULTRASOUND: 2D, color flow, and Doppler examination of the
abdomen was performed and compared with [**2133-5-28**]. There is a
TIPS stent in the posterior branch of the right portal vein and
right hepatic vein. The stent appears patent with wall-to-wall
color flow on Doppler exam. Doppler interrogation along the
stent shows velocity of 107 cm per second in the proximal
portion, 116 to 160 cm per second in the mid portion and 129 cm
per second in the distal portion. These velocities are
appropriate and have decreased in comparison to [**2133-5-28**]. The
main portal vein is patent with velocity of approximately 59 cm
per second. There is normal hepatopetal directional flow in the
main and right portal vein toward the TIPS stent. The inferior
vena is patent. There is appropriate flow in the main hepatic
and left hepatic veins. There is normal arterial waveform in the
common hepatic and anterior right hepatic arteries. There is a
small amount of intra- abdominal ascites around the liver in the
right upper quadrant.\
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent TIPS stent with appropriate velocities ranging from
107 to 160 cm per second. This is improved in comparison to the
prior study.
2. Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
.
Bilateral LENIs:
FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler images of the right and
left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins
were obtained. Normal flow, compressibility, augmentation, and
waveforms are demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is
identified.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right or left common
femoral, superficial femoral, or popl
