HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old woman with
a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bipolar
disorder, status post abdominal aortic aneurysm, who was
transferred from outside hospital, intubated secondary to no
available Intensive Care Unit beds at outside hospital.
Apparently, the patient presented from home with increased
shortness of breath, fever of uncertain duration.  She had no
vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain or palpitations.  Per outside
hospital, other systems reviewed and negative.  On
presentation to the outside hospital, she was saturating 84%
on four liters nasal cannula with an arterial blood gas of
7.17/77/44/27/67% on BiPAP 15/6 with 15 liters oxygen.  She
was then intubated after failing BiPAP.  Further history is
not available as the patient is currently intubated and
sedated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Recent diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
without pulmonary function tests.
2.  Bipolar disorder.
3.  Anxiety.
4.  Narcotic dependence.
5.  Status post right total knee replacement.
6.  Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

ALLERGIES:  Prednisone and Bactrim.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of
101.2, pulse 74, blood pressure 120/60 on assist control
700/16.  In general, intubated and sedated but arousable.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat anicteric.  Neck supple
with no lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention.  Lungs
- rhonchorous bilaterally.  No decreased breath sounds.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 9.7, hematocrit
53.8, platelet count 198,000, neutrophils 85, lymphocytes
10%.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, bicarbonate
33, blood urea nitrogen 32, creatinine 1.6, glucose 185.

Chest x-ray showed mild upper zone redistribution with
borderline cardiomegaly, no infiltrate.  Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm, left atrial dilatation, T wave
inversions in III and V1 without comparison.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory failure - This was felt secondary to chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease causing hypercapnia and
congestive heart failure causing hypoxia. A transthoracic
echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated left atrial
mild dilatation and elongation, right atrial dilatation, mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and hyperdynamic
systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 75% without
wall motion abnormalities.  This was felt to represent
diastolic dysfunction as the patient with evidence of
congestive heart failure on examination and chest x-ray.  She
was diuresed with intravenous Lasix and started on Diltiazem
for rate control.  The patient was treated with Aspirin and
her cardiac enzymes cycled which were negative for myocardial
infarction. The patient was felt also to be in exacerbation
of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given
significant wheezing on examination.  She was not treated
with p.o. steroids secondary to history of bipolar disorder
exacerbated by steroid use.  She was treated with inhaled
steroids and inhaled bronchodilators.  She was started on
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for questionable community
acquired pneumonia versus bronchitis exacerbating her chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  Repeat chest x-ray
demonstrated persistent left lower lobe consolidation.  The
patient did well with this treatment and was extubated in 24
hours.  She continued diuresis and treatment for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  The patient was then
transferred to the floor.  The patient did well until
[**2156-1-16**], when she was found to be rather somnolent in bed.
Arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of 7.33, pCO2 81, and
pO2 of 54, bicarbonate of 45.  This arterial blood gas was
felt to be representing a chronic respiratory acidosis and
metabolic compensation.  Given her multiple psychiatric
medications and pain medications, we discontinued her
Neurontin, discontinued her Gabapentin and Flexeril,
decreased her Fentanyl patch to 25 and decreased her
Trazodone dose.  The patient has since done well and her
breathing is approaching her baseline although she remains
oxygen dependent which she was not on at home.  Plan is to
continue diuresis, bronchodilators and inhaled steroids.  She
will be followed as an outpatient after rehabilitation with
pulmonary function tests and a sleep study by her primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] was [**Name (NI) 653**] during her hospitalization.

2.  Acute renal failure - The patient was admitted with a
creatinine of 1.6 of unclear etiology.  Repeat twelve hours
later was 1.0 and the patient remained in the 0.7 to 0.9
range for the remainder of the hospital course.  It is
unclear the etiology of her elevated creatinine.

3.  Bipolar disorder - We avoided the use of oral Prednisone
secondary to risk of her psychiatric exacerbation.  She was
continued on her psychiatric medications but we were unable
to get in contact with her psychiatrist to confirm each of
these.

4.  Chronic back pain - The patient was continued on her
Fentanyl patch and Gabapentin and Flexeril.  As noted above,
her Fentanyl patch was decreased to 25.  Her Gabapentin was
discontinued and her Flexeril was discontinued as well
secondary to sedation.  This may be reevaluated at a further
date.  Until then, she was treated with p.r.n. Percocet.

5.  Polycythemia - It was felt this is likely secondary to
the patient's chronic respiratory acidosis.  TSH was checked
and is normal.  Liver function tests, B12 and folate are
pending at the time of this dictation.  These may be followed
up as an outpatient basis.  The patient does deny significant
alcohol use.

6.  Deconditioning - The patient complains of chronic
weakness at home.  Her neurologic examination was
unrevealing.  TSH and electrolytes were normal.  She was
continued with physical therapy and will need further
physical therapy on a rehabilitation basis.

7.  Tobacco abuse - The patient was extensively counseled on
the need for her to quit smoking.  She was started on a
Nicotine patch.  She reports an allergy to Wellbutrin which
was therefore not started.
