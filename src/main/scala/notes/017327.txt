History of Present Illness:
Pt's a 68 year old male h/o HTN, COPD, with recent admission for
LE swelling with renal failure and transaminitis - found to have
dx of amyloid (by renal bx) now presenting today with bodyaches
and cough.  Per pt and daughter pt was feeling his own baseline
recently till just yesterday when his baseline mild sob (had
since [**9-25**]) started to worsen, new productive cough, +chills
but no sub fevers, and full body myalgias.  No rhinorrhea, HA,
does have c/o mild dizziness and non-specific intermittant CP in
bilat lower rib region - (non-pleuritic per pt).  Pt states also
had mild diffuse lower ab pain - no changes in stool or n/v, no
urinary changes/dysurea, has no recent change in LE swelling,
and no new rashes/arthralgias.  Of note, pt has had flu shot
this year, but pt's granddaughter in house has had been told she
had the flu earlier this week.

blood cx done in ED.  Pt with his t max on floor at 101.5 - pt
states feels mildly better since prior though subjectively.

[**1-6**] CXR:  FINDINGS:

There is atelectasis and an infiltrate in the left lower lobe.
This is new
since the prior examination and likely represents infection. The

cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Right lung is clear.

CONCLUSION:

An infiltrate in the left lower lobe suggestive of infection.
Please ensure followup to clearance.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2167-12-16**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm) with <35% decrease during
respiration (estimated RA pressure indeterminate).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.
Estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). TDI E/e' >15,
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is high
(>4.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increas
