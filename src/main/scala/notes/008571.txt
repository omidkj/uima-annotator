Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 86239**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor tissue valve. [**2106-6-10**]


History of Present Illness:
83 year old male with a known history of aortic stenosis, renal
insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and HTN who is presenting with

his aortic stenosis. Over the past five years, Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **]
has experienced dyspnea on exertion for which he declined
surgery. Over the last three months, he has experienced
worsening shortness of breath, dyspnea, cough, and pallor which
resolves with rest. Cardiac workup revealed Aortic valve area
<0.8cm2. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for surgical correction.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery
