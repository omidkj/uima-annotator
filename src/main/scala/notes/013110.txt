IMAGING:
EKG: [**1-12**]
Sinus arrhythmia. P-R interval prolongation. Since the previous
tracing
of [**2122-12-17**] the rate is slower. The P-R interval is longer.
Repolarization
pattern is unchanged.
.
[**1-12**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of cerebral edema. If there is concern for
central pontine
myelinolysis, MRI is recommended for increased sensitivity.
2. Stable sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease and
global
atrophy.
3. No mass effect or evidence of herniation.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Osmotic demyelination syndrome
("central and extra-pontine myelinolysis") generally occurs as
complication of the
treatment, with too-rapid correction, of patients with profound,

life-threatening hyponatremia, rather than the hyponatremia, per
se
.
[**1-13**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Borderline P-R interval prolongation. Q-T interval
prolongation. Early R wave progression. J point and ST segment
elevation are more apparent in limb and precordial leads. The
QRS width is also wider. Consider metabolic derangements.
Clinical correlation is suggested
.
CXR [**1-13**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-16**]:
Antilordotic positioning probably explains mild enlargement of
both hila.
Lateral aspect right hemithorax is excluded from the
examination. Remainder of the imaged lungs and pleural surfaces
are normal aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis. Heart is not
enlarged.
.
[**1-14**] Knee xray:
FINDINGS: There are severe degenerative changes involving the
patellofemoral compartment with bone-on-bone contact to the
patella with the trochlea at the lateral aspect. Bony
irregularity and erosion is seen. There is also faint
chondrocalcinosis. These overall findings can be seen in the
setting of CPPD arthropathy. There is a knee joint effusion.
