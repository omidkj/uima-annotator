Date of Birth:  [**2046-10-11**]             Sex:   M

Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Percocet / Magnesium Citrate

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Left lower extremity claudication, thoracic aneurysm.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PROCEDURES:
1. Endovascular repair of descending thoracic aortic
    aneurysm with extension .46-46/ 46-42- Talent thoracic
2. Right-to-left femoral-femoral crossover graft with 8-mm
    PTFE, right superficial femoral artery embolectomy with
    [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] catheter.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who has a complicated
vascular history which started with a ruptured infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm. This was repaired
initially with a Zenith Endograft. This graft then later
required explantation and aortobi-iliac graft operative repair.
He recovered well from this but suffered a left graft limb
occlusion which did not cause limb threat but has
created lifestyle-limiting left lower extremity claudication. He
presents at this time for endovascular repair of his remaining
thoracic aneurysm and femoral-femoral bypass graft.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD, s/p CABG ([**2117**]) with an LIMA to LAD and vein graft to
the first diagonal, obtuse marginal, and right coronary
arteries.
2. AAA, s/p repair as follows:
[**2127-10-8**] - Endovascular aneurysm repair. Bilateral femoral artery
exposures.
[**2127-10-16**] - Exposure of left common femoral artery and primary
repair; Balloon angioplasty of proximal extension cuff of
endograft(aorta) and left CIA and EIA
[**2127-10-30**] - Contained rupture of aortic aneurysm, status post
endovascular stent graft including suprarenal fixation, Palmaz
stent and cuff followed by conversion of endovascular aneurysm
repair to open aneurysm repair with infrarenal tube bifurcated
graft.
3. PVD, s/p bilateral carotid endarterectomies ([**2123**], [**2127**]).
4. COPD
5. Hyperlipidemia
6. Hypertension
7. ?Mild Congestive heart failure, per OMR, but pt denies pedal
edema or ever being told he had HF, EF > 55% 10/08
8. Anxiety
9. Left rotator cuff tear, s/p repair
10. Obstructive sleep apnea, on CPAP
11. Atrophic right kidney
12. s/p right knee replacement


Social History:
 Smoker x 40 years (~2 ppd), quit 21 years ago. Drinks 2 glasses
of wine [**2-23**] nights per week. Drinks egg nog with rum during the
holiday season.


Family History:
 Mother died of breast cancer. One sister had a "liver
condition". Patient is unsure whether there is any family
history of CAD.

CTA:

INDICATION: 81-year-old male status post PTFE/EVAR with
hematocrit drop.
Evaluate for hemorrhage.

CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are no pathologically enlarged
axillary
lymph nodes. Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 7
mm in short
axis, not meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement and
unchanged.
Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the thoracic aorta and
coronary
arteries. The patient is status post endovascular stent repair
of a
descending thoracic aorta aneurysm, however evaluation of the
stent itself is limited without contrast. There is no
pericardial or pleural effusion.

Lung windows reveal diffuse centrilobular and paraseptal
emphysema. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are not
significantly changed compared to [**1-10**], including a 7-mm
nodule at the left lung base (2:51). Left greater than right
bibasilar atelectasis is present. A small amount of secretions
are present in the right mainstem bronchus. Otherwise, the
airways are patent to the subsegmental level bilaterally.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Non-contrast evaluation of the liver,
spleen,
pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are of normal
caliber and there is no
pneumoperitoneum or free fluid. Scattered small mesenteric and
retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for
pathologic
enlargement. The patent is status post stenting of an abdominal
aortic
aneurysm, however, evaluation of both it and the known chronic
occlusion of the left common iliac and internal and external
iliac arteries is limited without contrast. Atherosclerotic
calcifications again involve the abdominal aorta and its
branches.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid and prostate are

unremarkable. Scattered diverticula of the descending colon are
not associated with acute inflammation. The bladder contains a
Foley and non- dependent air. There is no free pelvic fluid or
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
Post-surgical changes are noted in the inguinal regions
bilaterally with small hyperdense collections along the anterior
aspect of the common femoral vessels, left greater than right,
likely representing small hematomas, not large enough to cause a
hematocrit drop. A fem-fem bypass is new since [**1-10**].

Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. No significant hemorrhage noted in the chest, abdomen or
pelvis. Small
foci of hemorrhage along the anterior aspects of the common
femoral vessels bilaterally secondary to recent procedure are
not enough to explain hematocrit drop.

2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease status post stenting of
descending
thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms, though evaluation is
limited without contrast.

3. Scattered descending colonic diverticula without evidence of
acute
diverticulitis.

4. Emphysema with unchanged bilateral small pulmonary nodules.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 1730**] M  was admitted on [**1-24**] with Thoracic aortic
aneurysm and left
leg ischemia with left iliac occlusion. He agreed to have an
elective surgery. Pre-operatively, he was consented. A CXR, EKG,
UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained,  all other
preperations were made.

It was decided that she would undergo a:

Right to left femoral-femoral bypass graft done after
endovascular repair of descending thoracic aneurysm.

He was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, he was extubated and transferred to the PACU
for further stabilization and monitoring.

Had intra-op TTE. Preserved EF of 55%, diagnosis of Diastolic,
chronic CHF.

He was then transferred to the CVICU for further recovery. While
in the VICU he recieved monitered care. When stable he was
delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult was obtained.

While in the CVICU he did have atrial fibrillation. Cardiology
consulted.  Started on Amio. Remained in Afib. Po
