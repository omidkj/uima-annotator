Admission Date:  [**2199-11-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-11-11**]


Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
right subdural hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right burr hole for evacuation of right subdural hemorrhage
(acute on chronic)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 85 year old man with history of atrial fibrillation
s/p ICD, CHF, and CAD on warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel who
has complained of 3 days of headache. According to his son, he
apparently has had several falls recently
including this morning when his son found him in the bathroom
with altered mental status. The patient was taken to
[**Hospital3 8834**] where a head CT revealed a large
acute-on-chronic RIGHT SDH with sulcal effacement and midline
shift. The INR was 5.1, He received mannitol 60mg, dilantin 1G,
and
dexamethasone 10mg and was electively intubated for transport.
Apparently his pre-sedation neurological exam revealed him to be
A/Ox3 with LEFT sided upper and lower extremity weakness.

[**Hospital1 18**] ED Course: Patient received 2U Proplex (Factor IX) and 2U
FFP, a cervical collar was placed and a head CT and C-spine CT
were performed.


Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
CAD
 -s/p PCI to L circ and LAD in [**2-12**]
 -s/p MI [**04**] years ago
 -[**9-12**]: pMIBI showed a small fixed inferior defect with slight
 apical redistribution suggestive of ischemia.
 -[**12-13**] Echo showed EF 20% with regional left ventricular
systolic dysfuntion, HK basal septum, AK distal septum, lat wall
and basal ant. wall
[**Month/Year (2) **]
[**Month/Year (2) **]
CHF
Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin
Sick sinus syndrome, s/p pacer
s/p bilateral total knee replacement
s/p umbilical hernia repair

Social History:
Denies tobacco, ETOH, Italian speaking.  Patient apparently is
essentially self-sufficient and is able to garden on a daily
basis.


Family History:
No history of CAD

Physical Exam:
PE on Admission:
VS:  T afebrile  HR 85  BP 122/78 RR 18 (intubated)  Sat 100%
Due to acuity of presentation, the patient was not examined in
the absence of sedation. On propafol drip, his pupils were 2mm
and sluggishly reactive bilaterally. He was observed to move
both lower extremitites spontaneously while on CT scanner.

[**2199-11-7**] pCXR The lower end of the ETT is difficult to clearly
identify. The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged,
and it would probably be prudent to repeat the portable chest to
better visualize the ETT if this is an issue. Examination is
otherwise unchanged from the earlier chest x-ray this morning at
9:00 a.m.

[**2199-11-7**] CT C-spine
IMPRESSION:
1. Likely old fracture of the C7 spinous process.
2. Mild compression fracture of the C6 vertebral body.
3. Linear lucency invovling the anterior aspect of the T1
spinous process, which may represent small nondisplaced
fracture, vs. vascular channel.
4. Possible old fracture near the right T2 transverse process.
3. Anterolisthesis (grade 1) of the C5 on C6 and C7 on T1
vertebrae. There is no evidence of significant spinal canal
stenosis.
5. Degenerative disc disease throughout the cervical spine, most
severe at the level of the C6-C7.

[**2199-11-7**] CT Head
Large right subdural hematoma with mixed densities in the right
frontal, temporal and parietal lobe regions. Significant
leftward shift of normally midline structures. Compared to prior
CT study of [**2199-1-15**], this subdural hematoma is a new
finding.

[**2199-11-7**] CXR
Severe cardiomegaly is stable. Diffuse interstitial abnormality,
unchanged since [**9-24**], new since [**9-23**] is stable edema. There
is no appreciable pleural effusion. ET tube and nasogastric tube
are in standard placements. Transvenous right ventricular pacer
and pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in position and
intact although the lateral portion of the left pectoral
pacemaker along with the extreme lateral left chest wall is
excluded from the study. There is no large pleural effusion or
indication of pneumothorax.

[**2199-11-8**] ECG
Atrial fibrillation. Baseline artifact makes interpretation
difficult.
Poor R wave progression. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2199-9-24**] artifact is present and ventricular premature beats are
absent.

[**2199-11-10**] CXR
Resolving congestive heart failure.

[**2199-11-10**] Head CT No interval change.

[**2199-11-11**] EKG Atrial fibrillation. Left anterior fascicular block.
Poor R wave progression. Cannot rule out anterior myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-11-8**] left
anterior fascicular block is present and baseline artifact is no
longer seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 M on supratherapeutic coumadin s/p falls taken to OR for burr
hole and evacuation of right subdural hematoma.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred intubated to
the SICU for neuro checks and monitoring.  He was placed on
Cefazolin for drain coverage and dilantin x1week for seizure
prophylaxis.  CT spine showed multiple old cervical fractures
and cervical collar was placed.  Given his past cardiac history,
Cardiology was consulted, who recommended lasix and post-op EKG.
 On HD2, pt was extubated and subdural drain was removed.  On
HD3, pt was transferred to the stepdown unit and PT was
consulted, who recommended rehab.  On HD5, C-spine was
clinically cleared and pt was discharged to rehab in
neurologically stable condition.
