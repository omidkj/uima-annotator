Admission Date:  [**2142-3-1**]     Discharge Date: [**2142-3-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2083-10-25**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 58-year-old white
male with complicated past medical history including diabetes
mellitus type 1, complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy,
neuropathy, end-stage renal disease status post living
related kidney transplant in [**2130**] now with evidence of
chronic rejection, now on hemodialysis, status post
peritoneal dialysis catheter placement in [**2141-12-9**],
status post recent hospitalizations in [**2142-1-8**] for
choledocholithiasis, and cholecystitis status post ERCP and
cholecystectomy, presented on [**2142-3-1**] with complaints of
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and elevated
systolic blood pressure.

Patient reported that earlier on the day of admission, he had
undergone a session of hemodialysis.  While at hemodialysis,
his blood pressures elevated to a systolic blood pressure to
the 220s.  Per the patient, his baseline systolic blood
pressure is closer to 150.  After hemodialysis, later that
evening, he had the onset of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis,
and diffuse, generalized abdominal pain.  At that time, he
had also noted a fever of 102.9 associated with shaking
chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Upon admission was negative for chest
pain, shortness of breath, cough, sputum, sick contacts,
rash, medication changes, dysuria, or increased urinary
frequency.  Of note, the patient has a history of chronic
loose stools secondary to autonomic insufficiency caused by
his diabetes.  He also reports intermittent fevers of unclear
etiology dating back to his open cholecystectomy on [**2142-2-7**].

While in the Emergency Department, he was noted to have a
temperature of 102.0, blood pressure of 227/101, heart rate
of 95, respiratory rate of 22, oxygen saturation of 98% on
room air.  While in the Emergency Department, he received
total hydralazine of 10 mg IV x2, Phenergan 25 mg IV x2, and
levofloxacin 500 mg IV x1.  He also received Tylenol 650 mg
en route to the Emergency Department.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on [**2142-3-1**],
which noted two postoperative fluid collections with internal
air bubbles, one in the gallbladder fossa, and the other in
the subcutaneous tissue incision line.  Per the [**Location (un) 1131**],
could not exclude abscess formation.  There is stable
appearance of a transhepatic kidney with one large cyst.  Per
Transplant Surgery, the CT findings were consistent with
postoperative changes.  However, in light of these findings,
the patient was admitted to the Transplant Surgery service,
and was started on linezolid and levofloxacin for antibiotic
coverage.

During the admission, Surgical staff also noted trauma to the
right great toe.  He was seen by Podiatry.  Foot x-rays
demonstrated evidence of heavy calcification, but there was
no evidence of acute fracture in the region of the right
great toe.  There was noted an old healed fracture of the
fourth metatarsal bone.

While on the Surgical service, he continued to spike
temperatures to 101.3 and 101.5 while on linezolid and
levofloxacin.  He also had irregularities in his blood sugar,
for which he is followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes consult
service for better blood sugar control.  In light of his
complicated medical history and hospital course, he was
transferred from the Transplant Surgical service to the
Medicine service on [**2142-3-5**].
