tachypnic w/ RR in 40s, therefore was intubated due to
respiratory distress.  CXR notable for "white out" of R lung.
Given levofloxacin 750mg IV, 2L NS.

Admission CXR
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: Volume loss in right hemithorax has worsened
in the interim
with likely compensatory enlarging right pleural effusion. The
rightward
mediastinal shift is therefore stable. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax.
The left lung is grossly clear. Known spiculated right upper
lobe lesion is
not well evaluated on this study. Moderate cardiomegaly is
unchanged. Cerclage
wires and surgical clips are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Increasing volume loss and effusion on the right.
Stable
mediastinal shift.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 15427**] was a 69 F with h/o severe COPD (4L NC at home at
baseline) severe pulmonary artery hypertension and a h/o small
cell lung CA with post-XRT fibrosis of the right lung who was
admitted to the MICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and
septic shock due to pneumonia.  She was intubated in the ED.
Her condition deteriorated, and she required pressors for
hemodynamic support, as well as urgent bronchoscopy x 2 for
mucous plugging.   Her prognosis was poor. Her family felt that
she would not want an extended course on life support, and
decided to make her comfort measures only on [**2167-8-4**].  She died
shortly after extubation.  Her family and PCP are aware.  An
autopsy was declined.
