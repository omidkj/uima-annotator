Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
presyncope, palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 406**] is a 62 y/o F with recently diagnosed pancreatic
adenocarcinoma (last dose of chemo three days ago) as well as
Htn, T2DM, who presented to the ED from her oncologist's office
with postural palpitiations and lightheadedness since this
morning.  Her HR as recorded from her clinic note was 153 bpm.
She has no history of any tachycardias in the past.  She had
chills last evening, but no other localizing infectious
symptoms.  Denies cough, dyspnea, dysuria/polyuria, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, or neck stiffness.  She has
bilateral calf edema that is stable.  Her oncologist checked
outpatient labs, which showed hematocrit 25, leukocytosis of 18,
and glucose > 300.  In the oncologist's office, a peripheral IV
was placed and NS infusion was started, then discontinued on
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED inital vitals were 97.5, 150, 103/63, 16, 100% on room
air.  Exam notable for normal mentation, sinus tachycardia and
symmetric bilateral calf edema.  Labs revealed elevated WBC
count with left shift but no bandemia, stably low hct, mildly
elevated creatinine to 1.1 and bicarbonate of 19.  Troponin was
negative and BNP was > 4000.  She was given 2L NS for BP
support.  ECG was initially thought to be sinus tachycardia, but
repeat ECG was c/w atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
Cardiology was consulted for possible cardioversion, but her HR
converted to sinus rhythm with 20 mg IV and 30 mg PO diltiazem.
She was also given 325 mg aspirin and 8 units humalog.
.
CXR x2 showed pulmonary edema, and CTA showed no PE but +small
airways disease or atelectasis; note made of stale pancreatic
mass and diverticulosis.  She developed hypoxia to the high 80s,
and was placed on Bipap.  Given pulmonary edema and need for
Bipap, she was given 20 mg IV furosemide; O2 sats improved to
97% on 4L NC.  Bedside cardiac ultrasound showed a
non-circumferential pericardial effusion, and "good squeeze."
She was also given vancomycin and cefepime out of concern for
septic etiology for hypotension and tachycardia.  She had two 18
gauge PIV's and foley catheter placed.  Prior to transfer to the
ICU, her vitals were 88, 105/69, 18 97% on 4L NC.  She had no
fevers in the ED.
.
On the floor, the patient reports feeling tired and weak, but
denies any dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills,
sweats, or abdominal pain.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies recent weight loss or gain, headache, rhinorrhea or
congestion, cough, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin
changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F with locally advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing
gemcitabine chemotherapy admitted with rapid atrial flutter and
pulmonary edema.

#Acute diastolic heart failure:
Patient developed pulmonary edema and was initially admitted to
the ICU. She received BIPAP and IV diuresis with improvement in
symptoms. It is unclear the exact cause of heart faiulre but was
likely due to rapid atrial flutter and exacerbated by 2L NS she
received in the emergency department for an initial concern for
sepsis. Her echocardiogram showed mild LVH with EF>65% and no
focal WMA and mildly elevated PASP. Give
