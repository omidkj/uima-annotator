exacerbation, returned [**8-4**] w/ asthma exacerbation, transferred
[**8-5**] from MICU to floors on 2L nasal cannula.
.
1. Asthma: Pt. has long h/o asthma w/ severe exacerbation
(intubated once). Per records, there is a element of
anxiety/psychiatric issues as a possible trigger. Pt states she
does had A/C at home so this is not likely to be contributing to

MICU where she stayed overnight and was then put on  2L oxygen
by nasal cannula and sent to the floors. On the day of
discharge, peak flow was 300. Baseline is 450 and was 280 on
[**7-29**]. Prior to discharge, pt ambulated without O2 and maintained

hospital and pt was placed on the following taper for discharge:
7 days at 60mg, 7 days at 40mg, 7 days at 20mg, 7 days at 10mg.
Pt was discharged otherwise on all the same medications.

levaquin. Without fever or evidence of infection on CXR, pt was
not restarted on antibiotics in this hospital stay.
