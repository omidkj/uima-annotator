Chief Complaint:
"sepsis, pneumonia"


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 yo Cantonese-only speaking male with h/o type 2
diabetes, hypertension, medullary sponge kidney (with chronic
renal insufficiency) who now presents minimally responsive and
lethargic from home. Patient was not seen over the weekend by
family which is unusual, went to check in on him today and found
in fetal position in bed. Called EMS. Blood glucose was in 300s.
Patient did not c/o of any illness prior to being found
minimally responsive.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.6 146 132/108 16 98%. A left IJ
was placed for access.  Pt had fever to 104.8 in ED. Pt was
given PR Tylneol.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 143. Blood cx
and urine cx were sent and pt as given Vanc/Cefepime.   CT head
was neg for any acute intracranial process. CT torso showed a
RLL pnemonia.  UA was neg for infection.  Utox and Stox were
neg.  Labs revealed normal bicarb, normal lactate and Cr of 4.9
(baseline of 2.5).   CBC showed WBC of 11.7 with 7% bands.   Pt
received a total of 4L NS but was still hypotensive with SBP in
80s.  Thus, Levophed was started prior to transfer to ICU.
Vitals on transfer were T 99.9  HR 83  BP 81/63  RR 14  O2 sat
100% on 4L.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt is somnolent, noncommunicative.
Daughter at bedside states that he was in his USOH on Saturday.

EKG [**7-31**]:
Sinus tachycardia with increase in rate as compared with
previous tracing
of [**2201-4-28**]. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

CXR [**7-31**]:IMPRESSION: Opacity over the right midlung corresponds
to right lower lobe pneumonia revealed on subsequent CT Torso.

CT CHEST ABD PELVIS [**7-31**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Atrophic left kidney.

KUB [**8-2**]:IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated loops of small bowel,
suggestive of ileus, although not entirely specific.

Renal US [**8-3**]:IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis.
2. Atrophic left kidney.
3. Subcentimeter lower pole right renal cyst.
4. Medullary sponge kidney.

KUB [**8-2**]:IMPRESSION: Small [**Last Name (un) 12376**] distension without clear
colonic gas concerning for small bowel obstruction.

Stable KUBS on [**8-3**] - clinically without SBO.

RUQ US [**8-7**] IMPRESSION:
Limited abdominal ultrasound with normal liver echogenicity.
There is no
biliary dilatation.

Gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies:
A.  Antrum: Corpus/antral mucosa with focal, mild edema and
vascular congestion.
B.  Duodenum: Duodenal mucosa, within normal limits.
C.  Terminal ileum: Small intestinal mucosa, within normal
limits.
D.  Random colon: Colonic mucosa, within normal limits.

Cultures were all negative for Cdiff, C.diff PCR, legionella.
There were + blood and urine cultures likely due to
contamination of coagulase negative staph. Urine culture from

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo Cantonese-only speaking male with h/o type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, medullary sponge kidney (with chronic renal
insufficiency) admitted with altered mental status and fever,
found to have a RLL pneumonia. He subsequently developed profuse
diarrhea of unclear etiology. Infectious workup has been
negative.  Pt empirically treated for C.diff with PO vancomycin,
but this was stopped ultimately when c diff PCR returned
negative.  He was also found to have a new insulin dependence
for which he was started on 70/30 and a sliding scale. Hospital
course was complicated by renal failure; detailed below.

# Sepsis/Pneumonia, resolved:  In the ICU, the pt was
hypotensive, was given several boluses of IVF, but still
required support on Levophed, in the setting of pneumonia.  Pt
was given Vanc/Cefepime in ED and CT revealed RLL pneumonia.  UA
was neg for infection.  Blood and urine cx were sent and were
unrevealing of an infectious cause.  Other less likely sources
of infection included GI (though CT abd/pelvis negative), CNS
(no LP performed), skin/soft tissue.  Upon arrival to ICU, abx
were narrowed to CTX/Levo for severe CAP.  There were no
indications for HCAP coverage and no suspicion for aspiration.
Pt was able to be weaned off Levophed by the next morning and
his BPs remained stable.  Lactate bumped up to 3, then trended
down to wnl.  ABX were changed to cefepime/vanco on the 5th day
of his course due to a lack of improvement in fevers and the
onset of diarrhea.  He continued IV antibiotics for a total 8
day course.

# DKA, DM:  His anion gap metabolic acidosis on admsision was
likely due to DKA given ketones in UA. Tox screen was neg.  Pt
was agressively hydrated with 4L NS in ED, then [**3-14**] more L of LR
in ICU.  Pt was given 10U regular insulin, then started on 8U/hr
insulin gtt.  A few hours later, anion gap closed.  K was
repleted as needed.  Once blood glucose went <250, pt was
switched to D5 1/2 NS.  Pt was then transitioned to SC NPH [**Hospital1 **]
with ISS, and diet was advanced.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and per
their recs, he was switched to Lantus with an ISS.  However, the
patient's family was unable to accomodate administering insulin
3 times a day so his regiment was changed to Humulin 70/30 18
units SC BID.  His daughter will administer his evening insulin,
and his son will administer his morning insulin. Both were given
diabetic teaching prior to discharge, and patient is being set
up with a home VNA for additional monitoring and diabetic
teaching.

# AMS/Toxic encephalopathy: Differential was broad including
electrolyte abnormality (labs wnl), intracranial pthology (CT
head neg), toxins (Utox and Stox neg), hypoxia/hypercarbia
(satting well on 4L NC), endocrine abnormalities, CNS infection
but most likely [**1-11**] sepsis vs DKA.  RLL pneumonia was treated as
above.  DKA was treated as above. ABG revealed metabolic
acidosis.  CT head in ED showed no acute intracranial process.
MS improved significantly back to ba
