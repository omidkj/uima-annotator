Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
VT ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular tachycardia ablation ([**2112-2-29**])


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61836**] is an 86 year-old man with a history of HTN, HL,
CAD s/p CABG in [**2084**] and multiple PCIs/stents (most recently in
[**2105**]), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15-20%), VT s/p ICD placement
in [**2099**] and VT ablation in [**2108**], and chronic atrial fibrillation
on Coumadin who presents for repeat VT ablation.  Over the last
year, he has been having frequent episodes of VT that, while
terminated with ATP, have resulted in syncope, most recently on
[**2112-1-28**] while in [**State 108**].  He has not tolerated amiodarone
therapy in the past.  He is now being admitted for INR check and
heparin bridge in anticipation of a repeat VT ablation procedure
tomorrow ([**2112-2-29**]) with possible need for intra-procedural
Tandem heart.

Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 7914**] clinic note dated [**2112-2-23**], patient had
syncope on [**1-28**] with "surge come over him" with resultant
loss of consciousness. Transtelephonic transmission from his ICD
revealed an episode of VT in the fast VT zone at 290
milliseconds for which he received ATP twice in the VT zone,
followed by slowing of his tachycardia to 330 milliseconds and
ATP in the VT zone, which successfully terminated the
tachycardia. Patient underwent a CT scan for structural
evaluation for possible VT albation showing diffuse native
coronary artery disease.


Despite these issues, he denies any symptoms of heart failure
including PND, orthopnea, shortness of breath, leg edema,
claudication-type symptoms, and otherwise has been feeling okay.

He continues to exercise and has no new symptoms.

.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Patient endorses 3-month history of mild productive cough, no
recent sick exposure. Also endorses low-back pain since fall in
[**2-2**] with muscle spasms. Denies bowel/bladder symptoms. Current
pain level 0.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On admission, patient denies any other complaints or concerns.

II. Radiology

A. CXR
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Assessment of ET tube placement.

COMPARISON: [**2111-6-17**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has received an endotracheal tube. The tip of the tube projects
4.5 cm above the carina. There is no evidence of complications,
notably no pneumothorax.

Unchanged pacemaker in left pectoral position. Unchanged
moderate
cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis, but no evidence of
overt pulmonary edema. No focal parenchymal opacities have newly
occurred. Presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be
excluded.

III. Cardiology

A. EKG
Atrial fibrillation. Rightward axis. Consider biventricular
hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2111-7-8**] ST segment
depression in
leads V3-V4 has improved. The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
86-year-old male with HTN, HL, CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs,
ischemic CM (EF 15-20%), VT s/p ICD in [**2099**] and ablation in
[**2108**], and chronic afib presenting with unstable VT s/p
uncomplicated VT ablation on [**2112-2-29**].

CCU Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU s/p VT ablation intubated
and lying flat.  When his PTT was < 180, the sheath was pulled.
Six hours later, post cath check was unremarkable. The patient
was weaned off propofol and pressor support (phenylephrine which
was started intraoperatively while on propofol).  He was
successfully extubated. Heparin IV gtt and coumadin were
restarted and he was continued on his home medical regimen.  The
EP fellow adjusted his pacer settings to pace at 70 instead of
40.  He slept well and was ready for transfer back to his
primary team for bridging of heparin gtt to coumadin prior to
discharge.

Floor course:

# Ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD in [**2099**], s/p VT ablation in
[**2108**] and [**2112-2-29**]
Patient admitted for repeat VT ablation in setting of recurrent
symptomatic episodes of VT. Rhythm had been unstable causing him
to have episodes of syncope felt to be dangerous, especially in
the setting of warfarin. He has not tolerated amiodarone in the
past. He underwent VT ablation under general anesthesia with no
apparent complications and brief course in the CCU
