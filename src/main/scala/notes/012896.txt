Admission Date:  [**2155-12-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2156-1-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2113-9-19**]     Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 42-year-old
African-American female with a history of asthma (no prior
intubations or hospitalizations) who was admitted to the
Medicine Service for management of an asthma exacerbation.
approximately [**12-11**] when she developed worsening
shortness of breath and cough which was mildly productive.
She saw her primary care provider who prescribed azithromycin
but did not give her any prednisone.  Her respiratory status
worsened with peak flows decreasing to 250 to 150.

She presented to the Emergency Room where she was treated
Medicine Service.

On the floor, she was given nebulizer treatments every hour
for worsening respiratory status.  She was then transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer observation on
[**12-25**].  In the Medical Intensive Care Unit she was
started on Solu-Medrol q.1h. nebulizer treatments.   A chest
x-ray did not show any infiltrate.  Her nebulizer
requirements decreased to approximately q.2-4h., and the
patient was transferred back to the Medicine Service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma (no past intubations or hospitalizations).
2.  Schizophrenia.
3.  Diabetes.
4.  Arthritis.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Her medications on transfer from
the Medical Intensive Care Unit included Flovent 2 puffs
b.i.d., Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenously q.d., Haldol 7.5 mg
p.o. q.d., Seroquel 350 mg p.o. q.a.m. and q.h.s., a regular
insulin sliding-scale, Colace, Nicotine patch, and
albuterol/Atrovent nebulizer treatments every four hours.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to PENICILLIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She smokes approximately one pack per day.
She lives with her son.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had a
blood pressure of 159/87, heart rate of 107, respiratory rate
of 20, satting 90% on room air.  She was afebrile with
temperature of 98.2.  In general, she appeared to be very
alert and conversant.  She could speak approximately three
words before shortness of breath was noticeable.  Neck
examination revealed her neck was supple without any jugular
venous distention or lymphadenopathy.  Head, ears, nose, eyes
and throat examination revealed her pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light, approximately 5 to 4.  Her extraocular
movements were intact.  Her mucous membranes were moist.  Her
oropharynx was mildly erythematous with no exudate.
Adenopathy was noted.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm but tachycardic.  No murmurs.
Respiratory examination revealed the patient had an
inspiration to expiration ratio of 1.2.  She had coarse
rhonchi throughout, diffuse, and expiratory wheezing.  The
patient was noted to be using accessory muscle for
respiratory.  Abdomen examination revealed positive bowel
sounds, mildly distended, soft, nontender.  Her extremities
were warm without cyanosis, clubbing or edema, and palpable
pulses.

LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count
of 12.8, hematocrit of 35.8, platelet count of 531.  Sodium
of 138, potassium of 4.3, chloride of 99, bicarbonate of 31,
blood urea nitrogen of 15, creatinine of 2.6, glucose of 155.
She had an arterial blood gas on [**12-25**] which was pH
of 7.38, PCO2 of 46, and a PO2 of 64.  Microbiologic studies
revealed the patient had respiratory viral culture panel
which was negative and a Legionella antigen test which was
negative as well.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient had a chest x-ray on
[**12-31**] which was notable for no evidence of pneumonia.

She had a CT angiogram on [**1-1**] which revealed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service and continued to have
significant oxygen requirements of 4 liters to 5 liters of
oxygen.

The patient was moving minimal air on physical examination
and a q.4h. nebulizer treatment requirement, so we continued
her on Solu-Medrol.  We added Singulair to her regimen and
increased her Flovent to 4 puffs b.i.d.   The patient was
initially slow to progress remaining bed bound secondary to
dyspnea.  She also continued to have a significant oxygen
requirement as well as nebulizer treatment requirement.  Her
peak flow at this time was 100 to 120.  We became concerned
about her persistent oxygen requirement and started to
entertain the possibility of pulmonary embolism.   We
ultimately decided to obtain a V/Q scan which was unreliable
secondary to lack of a ventilation study.  We then obtained a
CT angiogram of her chest which was negative for pulmonary
embolism.

The patient then began to show slow signs of improvement,
first with a decreased nebulizer requirement and then with a
decreased oxygen requirement.  We transitioned her to a
prednisone taper at this time and opted to taper her over a
3-week time course.  The patient began to ambulate with
Physical Therapy, and at the time of discharge she was able
to maintain and oxygen saturation of 94% to 96% while
ambulating and 91% after one flight of stairs.  Her peak
flows at this time were noted to be approximately 200, very
close to her baseline.  She was relying solely on her
inhalers and was moves significantly more air on examination.
Still, we arranged for her to have home oxygen as well as a
home nebulizer machine.  She will be followed by the Asthma
Watch Program as an outpatient.

Initially, we did not give the patient any antibiotics as she
lacked an infiltrate on chest x-ray and did not have an
elevated white blood cell count or fevers.  Eventually, as
she was so slow to improve and continued to have a cough we
started on a 7-day course of levofloxacin.

As far as her other medical issues were concerned, we managed
to keep her diabetes under control despite the steroids with
her home dose of Glucophage and a regular insulin
sliding-scale.  We continued her on Haldol and Seroquel, but
she did not have any acute psychiatric issues during her
stay.  The patient was also noted to be consistently
hypertensive, and we opted to treat her with an ACE inhibitor
given her diabetes.  We asked that her primary care provider
follow her kidney function on this medication.
