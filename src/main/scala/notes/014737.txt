Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Aortic intramural thrombus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
75 M presents from OSH with concern for aortic dissection
seen on CT abdomen.  Around 7 PM today he had sudden onset mid
abdominal pain radiating to his back.  Pain was sharp, tearing
[**11-9**].  He denies having pain like this before.  Denies chest
pain.  His pain has resolved since he presented to [**Hospital3 **].  He did have 2 bouts of non-bloody, light brown emesis
at the OSH after getting pain medication.  CT abdomen at [**Hospital3 **] demonstrates concern for an aortic dissection.  A
repeat
CT torso was performed here.  On review with radiology there is
thrombus extending from just distal to the left subclavian
artery
and extends to the level of the SMA.  The mesenteric vessels
(celiac, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and renal arteries) are not involved.

airlines.
Quit smoking over 20 years ago.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
Gen: NAD, AOx3
Neck: no bruits
CVS: RRR no M/R/G
Abd: S/NT/ND  no bruits heard
LE: no LLE
Pulse: femoral palpable bilaterally.  dopplerable DP bilaterally
and palpable PT bilaterally

NEURO EXAM:

MS - pt repeats any phrases asked to him, and then will mumble
incomprehensibly when asked orientation questions.  Pt is
uncooperative with further questioning, but will follow some
simple commands, like "lift your arm"
CN - PERRL 2.5-->1.5, EOMI, tongue midline, no facial droop
MOTOR - pt is uncooperative with formal strength testing, but is
easily antigravity in his UE's bilaterally, and is [**6-4**] in grip
bilaterally.  In his RLE, he is antigravity at the hip and knee
and can also bend his knee and foot off the bed, so is at least
[**4-4**] throughout.  In his LLE, he is unable to lift his leg off of
the bed or bend his knee in the plane of the bed, but can wiggle
his toes and very minimaly flex and extend his foot at the
ankle.
REFLEXES - pt has intact and symmetrical reflexes in UE's.  His
R
patellar reflex is 1, and he is otherwise without reflexes in
his
LE's.  His L toe is now upgoing, and his R is mute.
SENSORY - pt is uncooperative with sensory exam, and responds
"yes" to if he feels very sensation even when examiner is not
touching him.
GAIT - deferred.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2146-4-1**]):

NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please
refer to hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..

FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2146-4-4**]):    NO GROWTH.

FINDINGS: Interval placement of a right-sided central venous
catheter with tip in the distal superior vena cava. There is a
widened mediastinum and rightward bowing of the trachea,
correlating with aortic intramural hematoma evident on [**2146-3-31**] CT. Cardiac and hilar contours are normal. Minimal
bibasilar atelectasis evident. Minimal blunting of the right
costophrenic angle likely reflects small right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax identified.

IMPRESSION: Right-sided triple-lumen catheter with tip
terminating in the
distal SVC. No pneumothorax. Stable widened mediastinum
correlating with
known aortic intramural hematoma. Small right pleural effusion.

VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.

CTA: Medialization of the common carotid arteries is noted. The
partially
imaged vertebral arteries are patent. Similar to the prior
examination, there is extensive intramural hematoma, beginning
just beyond the level of the left subclavian origin and
extending along the descending thoracic aorta. The overall
extent of intramural hematoma in the descending thoracic aorta
appears similar to the prior examination. Active contrast
extravasation into the intramural hematoma at the aortic arch
(2:40), now currently measures 25 x 17 mm, increased since the
previous examination (11 x 8mm previously). However, the extent
of aortic caliber and intramural hematoma is little changed.
Above the diaphragmatic hiatus at approximately the level of T10
is an 11 x 5 mm new focus of contrast within the intramural
hematoma. The diameter of the aorta at this level, however, is
unchanged. Intramural hematoma extends to the upper abdominal
aorta. The celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and
bilateral renal arteries (note is made of two right renal
arteries) are all patent. Contrast opacification in the upper
abdominal aorta has increased compared to the [**2146-3-30**]
study. The infrarenal abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and
there is little intramural thrombus. The iliac arteries, common,
internal, and external are normal in caliber.

CHEST: New small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
dependent
atelectasis are present. Apical emphysema is present. The heart
appears
normal without pericardial effusion. No pathologically enlarged
lymph nodes are present in the axilla, hilum, or mediastinum. A
9-mm nodule is present in the left lobe of the thyroid.

ABDOMEN: The spleen, adrenals, and pancreas appear normal.
Numerous
gallstones are present in the gallbladder with minimal wall
hyperenhancement which may suggest chronic inflammation, but
this is little changed from the prior study. The enhancement of
the liver appears homogeneous without arterial enhancing
lesions. The kidneys enhance symmetrically without
hydronephrosis. Bilateral hypodense lesions which are too small
to characterize are present. An exophytic cyst arising off the
upper pole of the right kidney is unchanged. No free air or free
fluid is present. A portacaval lymph node measures 14 mm (2:135)
unchanged. Stomach and abdominal loops of bowel appear normal.

PELVIS: The small amount of simple fluid is present in the deep
pelvis, new.  Otherwise, bowel loops appear normal. The bladder
is decompressed with a Foley catheter. The prostate is enlarged
measuring 5.7 cm in transverse dimension. Bilateral
fat-containing inguinal hernias are present.

BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are present in the
thoracolumbar spine and at the right hip, but no suspicious bone
lesions are present.

IMPRESSION:

1. Intramural thrombus of the thoracic aorta. While the diameter
of the
aorta and the extent of intramural thrombus appears similar,
there is one area of increased contrast extravasation into the
intramural hematoma at the level of the aortic arch, and a new
area of contrast extravasation into the hematoma at the level of
T10. Stable patency of the mesenteric vessels with stable
abdominal aortic intramural hematoma.

2. No specific findings to explain the patient's parasthesia
noting lack of spinal artery delineation by this type of study.
A spinal MRI may be helpful to further evaluate for spinal cord
abnormalities i
