epistaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
nasal packing by ENT

History of Present Illness:
75 yo M with a history of mechanical AVR and MVR, afib on
coumadin who complains of epistaxis. The patient was cleaning
his nose this morning, and his nose started bleeding. He has
never had issues with nose bleeds or GI bleeds before. Notably,
the patient saw his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2124-4-18**]. Routine labs showed BUN of
112 and Cr of 2.3. It was thought that his lasix dose of 80mg po
bid was too much. He was told to hold the lasix and repeat his
labs. Repeat labs from [**4-26**] showed BUN 130 and Cr of 2.1.
.
In the ED, Labs notable for INR 3.9, Hct 27 down from bl(32),
but found to have ARF w K 6.2. Trop 0.05. ED course complicated
by hypotension to SBP 50s, fluid responsive, now SBP 100s w 3L
fluid, found to have UTI, ? urosepsis, with 18gauge IVx2. EKG:
paced @60, no ST/Twave changes, no peaked Ts. ENT did Silver
nitrate + affrin, found bleeding to be intermittent, requiring
packing. Given D50, insulin, ca gluconate repeat 4.2->5.6 CXR no
acute process. UA c/w UTI, Blood and urine culture and was
started on zosyn. FS<70, likely [**1-12**] to poor clearance of insulin
in setting of renal failure, continue D50 prn. 98.3 65 94/45 18

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo M with a history of mechanical AVR and MVR, afib on
Coumadin, who presents with epistaxis also found to have
hypotension, hyperkalemia, and ARF.
.
#Hypotension: The patient had hypotension to the 50s in the
emergency department, which was transient and fluid responsive.
The etiology was thought to be hypovolemia. Lasix was held, and
the patient was admitted to the MICU for hemodynamic monitoring.
He had no further hypotension.
.
#Epistaxis: The patient presented with epistaxis, which was
treated with Afrin, silver nitrate, and packing in the emergency
department.
.
#Acute kidney injury: Differential diagnosis included pre-renal
and obstructive etiology. A foley catheter was placed. Lasix was
held. Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis but some benign
cysts which should be followed by primary care doctor. Renal
function completely recovered. He will follow-up with outpatient
urologist after discharge.
.
#Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with potassium 6.1 in the
setting of acute renal failure. He was given calcium, insulin,
and glucose in the emergency department. In the MICU, he
received Kayexalate. Enalapril was held. Potassium level
normalized prior to discharge. He never developed EKG changes.
.
#Urinary tract infection: Treated initially with ceftriaxone and
switched to nitrofurantoin prior to discharge based on urine
culture sensitivities to complete a 7-day course.
.
# Rash/peripheral eosinophilia: Rash on both arms started prior
to admission. Suspected to be a drug reaction and offending
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] (Avodart) was stopped. Patient treated symptomatically.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Coumadin initially held given
supratherapeutic INR. Re-started prior to discharge and patient
instructed to follow-up closely with [**Hospital 197**] clinic.
.
#BPH: Held tamsulosin given foley. Foley removed and restarted
tamsulosin prior to discharge.
