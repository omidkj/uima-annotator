CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post cardiac arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 16762**] is a 73-year-old
Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for
CAD, status post three vessel CABG in 3/00 with non Q wave MI
in [**7-29**], status post proximal LAD OM1 stenting with PTCA of
the left circ, also with metastatic renal cell cancer status
post bilateral nephrectomy, type 2 diabetes mellitus and
hypercholesterolemia.  The patient initially presented [**3-/2163**]
with chest pain and inferolateral ST elevations.  Cardiac
catheterization showed the following:  Inferolateral inferior
hypokinesis, EF 45% with an LVEDP of 24, proximal RCA 100%,
proximal LAD 80% with diffuse distal disease, 80% D1, 30%
proximal circ, 50% mid circ with 70% OM1.  He underwent CABG
[**3-/2163**] with SVG to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and SVG to the D1.
Also had a pericardectomy at that time.  The patient had a
TTE [**2164-4-27**] which showed left atrial enlargement, right
atrial enlargement, EF 20-25%, continues to have minimal
anginal symptoms and was referred for an exercise mibi on
[**2164-4-30**] for preoperative evaluation.  Exercised four minutes
on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, 54% maximal heart rate with rate pressure
product 17.  Nuclear images showed inferior apical lateral
partially reversible perfusion defects with global
hypokinesis in the context of preoperative for right
nephrectomy he underwent elective cardiac cath [**8-17**] and [**8-20**]
which showed an LVEDP of 30 mmHg, severe native three vessel
disease, sequential 50% and 70% proximal LAD with small
aneurysm proximal to D1, severely diseased D1 with twin LAD
up to 95% proximal stenosis, rotablated PTCA stent in origin
of the mid C1, left circ 90% proximal, 40% diffuse in the
lesions, proximal lesion involving OM1 origin, SVG 100%
proximal discrete lesions times three.  Cath [**8-20**], left circ
intervention, PTCA stent OM1 with rescue PCA left circ, 70%
stenosis distal to proximal LAD stent, PTCA stent of LAD.
The patient had left brachiocephalic AV fistula placed [**5-29**],
hemodialyzed since [**3-29**].  He underwent adrenal sparing right
nephrectomy [**2164-10-5**].  Following that procedure patient had
been doing well, could walk [**3-3**] blocks, climb two flights of
stairs without dyspnea, working part time as a furniture
salesman.  Today the patient went to hemodialysis, had
substernal chest pain and noted one episode prior to that
evening, relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.  An EKG in
dialysis showed [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V1 to V3.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital6 3105**].  In the Emergency
Room the patient had a V fib arrest, cardioverted with 200
joules times one, reverted back to sinus rhythm.  He was
placed on an Amnio drip and intubated for airway protection.
There was a questionable aspiration event.  The patient was
subsequently found to have ST elevations in 2, 3 and AVF, V6
with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in 1.  The ST elevations resolved
after cardiac arrest.  The patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 1444**] cath lab which showed 80%
proximal LAD, 60% mid LAD, 90% proximal D1, mid D1 90%,
proximal left circ 70%, OM1 90%.  He had PTCA and kissing
balloons of the left circ and OM1 lesions, also had PTCA of
the LAD and D1 lesions.  The patient was transferred to the
CCU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD status post three vessel CABG in
3/00, systolic heart failure, recent [**State 531**] Heart
Association class II, EF 20-25%,renal cell carcinoma, status
post left nephrectomy in [**2153**] with high dose IL-2 for
pulmonary mets [**2153**], status post resection of penile
recurrence [**2158**], right renal mass in [**2162**], status post IL-2
low dose, acute renal failure secondary to right renal
hemorrhage treated with embolization [**3-29**].  The patient had
adrenal sparing right nephrectomy and has been on
hemodialysis, had an AV fistula in the left arm which has
been undone due to poor maturation.  The patient dialyzed
through a right subclavian Permacath.  Type 2 diabetes, high
cholesterol, GERD.  No alcohol or tobacco.  He worked part
time in a furniture store.  He is currently married and has
family which is involved in his care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 96.7, pulse
48-54, blood pressure 116/58, respiratory rate 12, oxygen
saturation 100%.  Generally he was intubated, sedated.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Neck was supple
with normal JVD.  Cardiovascular, brady with 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border and S3 at
the apex.  Breath sounds anteriorly.  GI, he had multiple
well healed abdominal scars, nontender, soft, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, no edema, cool lower extremities below
mid calf, 2+ popliteal pulses, 1+ PT bilaterally, groin with
a right femoral sheath in place.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium 133, potassium 5.6,
chloride 95, CO2 23, BUN and creatinine 72/7.7 with glucose
of 146, hematocrit 38.1.  EKG showed 3-[**Street Address(2) 5366**] elevations in
2, 3, AVF, V6 and 1 mm depressions in 1 and also had [**Street Address(2) 2051**]
depressions in V1 through V3, status post cardioversion,
these elevations somewhat resolved.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac
Intensive Care Unit status post a catheterization during
which he had PTCA of the LAD, D1, left circ and OM1 with
kissing balloons at the left circ and OM1.  The patient was
initially in stable condition.  He was to undergo
brachytherapy the day following admission on [**2164-12-28**].  The
patient underwent brachytherapy on [**12-28**].  He had left circ
AV groove side branch dilated full expansion 3.5 with
persistent 90% lesion likely strut.  He had left circ
marginal long overlapping stents redilated with 3.5 by 20
balloon and proximal stent deployed just distal to the left
main overlapping the proximal prior stent.  LAD proximal
overlapping stents redilated.  Beta cath brachytherapy
delivered to both left circ with overlapping margins and no
angiographic mist and delivered to proximal LAD, transient
hypotension with both brachytherapies.  At baseline his
systolic blood pressure was 90 with very still heart rate in
the 30's to the 38's, not responsive to Atropine.  He was
brought back to the floor on a Dobutamine infusion with a
heart rate of 75/minute, no ectopy and systolic blood
pressure of 100-120.  He was also placed back on Reo-Pro and
Plavix and Aspirin.  The patient was intended to be on
Dobutamine for 24 hours and weaned if severely bradycardic.
He was thought to need a pacemaker.  Upon return to the
floor, the patient's blood pressures became to drop on the
Dobutamine.  He was quickly switched to Dopamine and received
a normal saline bolus.  Ultimately Levophed was started with
good blood pressure response.  The patient subsequently had a
Swan Ganz catheter placed which revealed PA pressure 57/23
with a wedge in the 17-19 range, maps at this time were
38-74, CVP was 5, FVR was calculated at 437 with a cardiac
output of 6.7.  The patient's next venous O2 was in the
80-85% range.  It was thought that the patient was in
possible septic shock or hypovolemic shock given recent
dialysis and his vasodilation.  The patient was given normal
saline.  The morning following the Swan placement the patient
had a lower GI bleed which required transfusion of 18 units
of packed red blood cells.  The patient had an EGD done by
the gastroenterology consult service as he had coffee grounds
in his NG lavage and it was thought this could be a rapidly
bleeding duodenal source.  The patient's EGD was inconclusive
with no active areas of hemorrhage noticed.  The duodenal
bulb was edematous without evidence of ulcerations.  The
patient had a large hiatal hernia, no old blood was seen.
The patient continued with his blood transfusions which
stabilized his blood pressure.  Over the next 24
