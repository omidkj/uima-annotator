Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, angiogram, IVC filter
placement x 2


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 438**] is an 82 year old woman with history of IDDM, HTN,
remote DVT, recent fall resulting in femur fracture s/p fixation
and rehab stay, presenting from home with bright red blood per
rectum x2 days.  The patient had only been home with a VNA for
two days. On Saturday, [**2141-6-3**], the patient experienced
her first episode fo bright red blood per rectum. She says that
she went to the toilet, and did not have a bowel movement but
instead a rush of blood evacuated. Throughout the following two
days, she continued to have bright red blood in both her diaper
and the toilet. The pain had had some "gurgling" and pressure in
her epigastric area but denies specific areas of pain. She
further mentions some lower abdominal crampiness that she says
was reminiscent of her menstrual cramps. She also endorses
dysuria. The patient denies any nausea and vomiting and reports
that her appetite has not been affected over the past several
days. The patient has never before had an experience like her
current bleeding. She denies any history of hemorrhoids or
diverticulosis/itis.
.
In the ED, initial Vitals: 97.5 56 135/52 16 96% RA. Rectal
Exam: melena with BRBPR. IV protonix drip started. NG lavage did
not bring out any coffee ground material. On rectal exam, black
tarry stool mixed with bright red blood. Both upper and lower Gi
bleed are in the differential. Melena and High BUN/Cr points
towards upper GI bleed, but no coffee grounds in NG lavage point
otherwise. BRBPR point towards lower GI source. EGD done this
morning: Gastritis in the stomach. Otherwise normal EGD to third
part of the duodenum. Preparing for colonsocopy in morning.
Recommend IR to be on board. If pt bleeds briskly, pt might need
bleeding scan or CTA and embolization.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient evacuated 500cc-1L of
maroon blood and clot.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Dysuria, eipgastric discomfort, suprapubic crampiness
(-) Other wise negative.

EGD [**6-4**]:  Gastritis in the stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Colonoscopy [**6-5**]:  Diverticulosis of the whole colon, however
more noted in the left side of the colon. (endoclip)
Polyps in the whole colon
Blood in the Left colon
Several attempts were made to intubate the terminal ileum
without success.
Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Bilateral lower extremity duplexes:  1. Nonocclusive thrombus
within the right femoral vein, which is of indeterminant age.
2. Nonocclusive thrombus within the left great saphenous vein.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6303**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 14:45 on
[**2141-6-8**].

Hip X-ray [**6-13**]:
1. ORIF of the right femur supracondylar fracture. No
complication of the
hardware or cement. The fracture lines are still visible.
2. Degenerative changes of the bilateral hips.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**6-14**]): The imaged lung bases are
clear with minimal
bibasilar atelectasis without focal nodularity, pleural or
pericardial
effusion. Coronary atherosclerotic calcifications noted. Mild
cardiomegaly
also seen.

Please note assessment of solid and visceral organs is limited
in the absence of intravenous contrast. The liver is
hypoattenuating, which could reflect mild fatty infiltration.
Focal hypodensity is seen in the left lobe (2:13), which is too
small to be fully characterize. Gallbladder is unremarkable with
the exception of some layering hyperdensity which likely
reflects [**Doctor Last Name 5691**]/small stones. The pancreas, spleen, and
bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable with scattered
hypodensities in the spleen also too small to characterize but
likely cysts or hemangiomata. The kidneys are atrophic with a
tiny exophytic protuberance interpolar region of the right
kidney which is too small to be characterized. Simple cyst
extends off the inferior pole of the left kidney. Indeterminate
lesion extends of the lower pole of the right kidney.

Small and large bowels are unremarkable with the exception of
diverticulosis without active inflammation. The appendix is seen
and is normal. There is no free air or free fluid in the
abdomen. There is no focal fluid collection or hematoma. There
is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy though scattered
nonenlarged nodes are noted. Infrarenal IVC filter is noted.
Dense atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and major
branches including a long segment of the SMA is noted.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Bladder, uterus and rectum are
unremarkable.
No pathologic pelvic adenopathy is seen with the largest node
measuring 8 mm in the left pelvic side wall. There is no
inguinal adenopathy. There is no free pelvic fluid.

OSSEOUS AND SOFT TISSUE STRUCTURES: There is no lytic or
sclerotic bony
lesion concerning for osseous malignant process with multilevel
degenerative changes in the spine including marked lower lumbar
facet arthropathy. There is no groin or pelvic hematoma
identified.

Lateral plate and screw fixation is seen of right distal femoral
fracture
without hardware or cement related complication. Fracture lines
are still
evident without callus formation and slight displacement of
small fracture
fragments is noted. Vascular calcification seen along the SFA
and popliteal
arteries bilaterally.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hematoma in the abdomen, pelvis,
retroperitoneum, groin, or thigh.
2. Diverticulosis and cholelithiasis without a
