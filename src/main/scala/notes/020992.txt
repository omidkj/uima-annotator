Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was originally seen in clinic on [**2132-2-28**]. After PAT, pt was
directly admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-3-25**] and went to the OR and
underwent a AVR with a 23mm CE pericardial tissue valve. He was
also planned to have a CABGx1, but did not receive this b/c pt.
had b/l saphenous vein stripping. He would receive PCI/stent
later during hospital course. Please see op note for full
surgical details. Pt. tolerated the procedure well and had total
bypass time of 90 minutes and cross-clamp time of 72 minutes. He
was transferred to CSRU in stable condition with a MAP of 75,
CVP 14, PAD 15, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 25, HR 84 A-paced and being titrated on
Propofol and Neo. Once in the OR, Neo was off and NTG and
Nipride were started secondary to hypertension. He continued to
have adequate amount of chest tube output despite deligent
efforts with products(FFP/Cryo/platelets/Protamine/PRBC). Do to
this continued postoperative hemorrhage, he was brought back to
the OR and re explored for bleeding. Please see op note. Pt was
then brought back to the CSRU in stable condition. He remained
on mechanical ventilation until early POD #1 when propofol and
ventilation were weaned and he was extubated. He was awake,
[**Last Name (LF) 3584**], [**First Name3 (LF) 2995**], and following all commands at time of extubation. On
this day, diuresis and B-blockade were started and he remained
on a Nitro gtt. Throughout day pt cont. to have slightly tenuous
respiratory status and required repeated alb/Atrovent nebs,
Lasix, IS and coughing exercises. POD #2 pt's chest tubes were
removed and his was now weaned off of Nitro. Had some course
breath sounds and cont. to receive diuretics. On early POD #3,
despite repeated CPT, nebs, OOB, and diuretics pt had to be re
intubated for pending respiratory failure. Pt. also went into
AFIB, and after Lopressor dose and Amio bolus pt converted to
SR. An Amio drip was started. Sputum, Blood, Urine, and CVL
cultures were taken and Levo was started due to increased WBC
(12,000). ABX were changed to Zosyn and Vanco. CXR revealed LUL
infiltrate. Pt. remained on ventilatory support until POD #5
when he was successfully weaned from vent. support. Pacing wires
were removed and tube feeds began on POD #4. On POD #6 a swallow
eval was done secondary to difficulty taking meds. Pt passed
swallow. POD #7 he was given a Plavix load for preparation of
cardiac cath the next day and was also transferred to telemetry
floor. POD #8 he was brought for a cath and had PCI/stenting to
RCA. Lasix was held due to increased Creatinine but was started
again on POD#9, creatinine 1.2. He continued to be
hemodynamically stable and was encouraged to get OOB and
ambulate. On POD #10, his lasix was discontinued as he was below
his pre operative weight and his creatinine was elevated to 1.4.
 On POD#12 his antibiotics were discontinued, he remained
afebrile and was cleared for discharge to rehab on POD#13.
