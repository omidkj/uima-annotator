FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother had coronary artery

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is a 65-year-old male
looking older than his stated age with tracheostomy tube,
appearing in mild distress.  Vital signs in the Emergency
Department on admission were temperature 96.2 degrees, pulse
117, blood pressure 90/54, respiratory rate 28, oxygen
saturation 100% on room air.  HEENT examination revealed
extraocular movements intact.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were dry.  The neck
revealed no lymphadenopathy but there was blood oozing from
the tracheostomy site.  The chest revealed decreased breath
sounds on the left side but the chest was difficult to
auscultate due to tracheostomy tube, questionable crackles on
the left side.   Examination of the heart revealed inability
to auscultate S1 or S2.  The abdomen revealed G-tube surgical
scar.  There was tenderness to palpation in both lower
quadrants.  Rectal examination was guaiac positive.  On
genitourinary examination, the patient was wearing a diaper
for incontinence.  The skin revealed multiple ecchymoses on
both arms bilaterally.  Neurologically, right knee dependent
reflex was increased approximately 3+ with clonus.  The left
Babinski reflex showed upgoing toes.  The left arm and left
leg showed signs consistent with hemiparesis.  The patient
did sense painful stimulus in the left leg.  The patient was
oriented to place and person but was unaware of date.  He
seemed mildly confused about the length of his recent
symptoms.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicine
team with an initial blood pressure of 90/54 and heart rate
of 117.  The blood pressure increased to 115/56 and heart
rate was 89 with 1 liter of normal saline.  However his
hematocrit decreased from 33 to 28 and he was transfused with
2 units of packed red blood cells overnight.  His hematocrit
continued to decrease to 23 and he had another large
melanotic stool.  The morning of the day after admission, he
underwent endoscopy which revealed a cratered 7 mm ulcer at
the anterior bowl of the duodenum with a visible vessel.
This was treated with epinephrine and BICAP electrocautery.
Other findings noted a small hiatal hernia in the esophagus,
esophageal erosions, multiple diverticula in the middle and
lower third of the esophagus, and [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear at the
EG junction.  There was also fundal gastritis in the stomach.
After the endoscopy, the patient was moved back to the floor
and overnight he had another very large melanotic stool and
more coffee ground emesis and his blood pressure decreased to
70/40 at which point the decision was made to transfer the
patient to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for emergency
endoscopy.  The emergency endoscopy performed in the
Intensive Care Unit identified the same bleeding duodenal
ulcer site which was treated with epinephrine and
electrocautery; however, attempted endoscopic clipping of the
bleeding vessel was unsuccessful.  During this period in the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient was transfused with 5 units
of packed red blood cells.  The patient remained in the MICU
for two days.  On his second day in the MICU, repeat
endoscopy was performed at which point endoscopic clipping of
the vessel was successful.  However the patient's hematocrit
decreased to approximately 28 and the patient received
another unit of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit
continued to climb.  On hospital day #4, the patient was
transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit and back
to the floor.  His hematocrit appeared stable.  He had one
small melanotic stool but his hematocrit had remained above
30 and he had not required any further transfusions.  Total
amount of blood transfusion the patient had required over the
hospital course had been 8 units of packed red blood cells.

Other significant hospital events for Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] included
replacement of his GJ-tube which was converted to a G-tube by
Interventional Radiology and he also had some angina which
was relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin.  The patient was
stable at discharge.
