Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10223**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 65 yo male, DM2, CRI, COPD, h/o CAD s/p CABG x 3 ([**2196**]),
multiple stents (last in [**12-5**] to previously grafted RCA/ last
viz catheterization [**2-5**]), open abdominal wound healing by
secondary intention p/w left sided chest pain since last night.
Presented to OSH with chest pain on left side, shooting down
arm, and hip. Pt says it was a [**11-11**]. Associated with NBNB
vomitting after drinking water.  No pain at abd wound site,
states it has been "looking better than ever."  No change in
chronic cough, no change in sob.  At baseline DOE.  No urinary
frequency/urgency/dysuria. Started on hep/int/dopa transferred
here.
*
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. EKG in ED: sinus at 88. Nl axis. Nl
intervals. LVH by voltage criteria. ST horizontal depressions 2
mm in lateral leads (V4-V6)  Morphine 4 mg x 3, metoprolol 5 mg
x 1 with decrease in BP to sbp 70s.  Temp 103, WBC elevated -
Started on sepsis MUST protocol and sent to unit. Seen by cards,
felt EKG changes [**3-6**] demand ischemia, enzymes remained negative,
chest pain abated.  Hep/integrillin/dopa off.

MICU course:
1) CV: as listed as above. Was continued on Aspirin. Once HD
stable, restarted on lipitor, lisinopril 20 daily, metoprolol 50
[**Hospital1 **]. BP stable w/ BP 130s-150s/60s-80s P 90s. COmplained of
episode of chest pain similar to prior MI on [**3-19**]. RR 40s O2
100% on NRBM , associated with left hip pain. received 2 SL
nitro w/ improveoment in SOB but no change in chest pain.
Started on nitro gtt @ 6/hrt. Received 40 IV lasix and total 4mg
IV morphine and Chest pain decreased to [**5-12**] and additional
improvement in SOB. EKG, sinus tachy 117, concave ST elevateion
in V2 (old), ST depression V3-V6 w/ TWI V5-6 (all old). Asses to
becardiogenic wheezing/CHF exacerbated by albuterol nebs and
tachycardia with resultant pulmonary edema. CXR w/ RUL
infiltrate (nbew) but no CHF/pulm edema. CE negative. EKG @ 4:30
pm on [**3-19**] no ischemic ahges. @5pm still with 3/10 chest pain on
150 mcg/kg/hr ntg, but VSS (BP 137/75 P 80 O2 96% comfortable).
Likely CP [**3-6**] to PNA or sternal wound

2> leukocytosis: Eivdence of RUL on last CXR explaining
fever/CP. started on levaquin 5-- daily (10 day course). Vanco
and flagyl started initially for empiric coverage for concern of
open rectal flap wound v. pneumonia (CT with new focal ground
glass opacity) v. bladder infection, open abdominal wound as
source. PLastics do not suspect open abd wound as source. on
[**3-20**], assessed RUL as most likely source of leukocytosis

3. Respiratory: Initial concerning of pulm edema. XRAY no signs
of edema on [**3-19**]. Most likley pleurisy from pneumonia +/_
anxiety disorder+/_ sternal arthritis. Pt was continued on
albuterol/atrovent nebs  q6 prncautiously

4.> CHF: HIstory of CHF history but no formal TTE. No signs of
CHF on CXR on [**3-19**]. Restarted on lasix 40 daily, continued on
lsiiniopril 20, maintained on 2gm NA diet

5. HTN-stable on lopressor and ACEI

6. DM- stable cont on lantus 65 + SSI

7. chronic DVT: onocumadin for possible DVT (per pt). INR =3.4
at last. Restart coumadin at 2.5 today

8. ARF- Imrpoved with excellent UOP. restarted on lasix.

9. Access: TLC changed to PIV.


Past Medical History:
1. Left circumflex stent in 3/[**2194**].
2. Catheterization in [**10-4**] with three vessel disease.
3. Status post coronary artery bypass graft x 3.
4. s/p catheterization [**12-5**]- with stent to native right
coronary artery with an occluded saphenous vein graft.
5. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
6. CRI with a baseline creatinine of 1.1 to 1.3.
7. Hypothyroidism
8. COPD
9. ? PE in [**2196**]
10. History of ETOH.
11. Pancreatitis.
12. s/p CABG [**11-3**] complicated by osteomyelitis of the sternum.
The
patient had a left hemisternectomy in [**2197-1-1**] due to
infection. Sternal debridement rectus flap and bilateral
pectoralis flaps. Still open wound.
13. History of lens transplant in right eye secondary to
cataract.

Last cath in [**2-/2198**]: LMCA normal. LAD occluded . The LCX was
widely patent and the stented sites were open. At the origin of
the OM3, there was 50% restenosis. The RCA stents were widely
patent. LIMA-LAD patent.

Cath ([**12-5**])
The LAD had a proximal 60% lesion, a mid 80% lesion, and distal
competitive flow from the LIMA-LAD. The LCX stents were widely
patent with normal flow. The RCA had a proximal 60% lesion at a
[**Last Name (un) 29846**] crook, with diffuse mid disease up to a sub-total
occlusion in the mid vessel. The distal vessel supplied a lower
AM/PDA and a RPL branch. 2. Successful stenting of the RCA was
performed with overlapping 2.5 x 28 mm and 3.0 X 13 mm Cypher
(drug-eluting) stents, post-dilated using 2.5 and 3.25 mm NC
balloons respectively. There was <10% residual stenosis, no
angiographically-apparent dissection, and normal flow (see
PTCA Comments).

Pertinent Results:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:

Marked coronary artery calcifications are seen. Small
mediastinal lymph nodes, not meeting size criteria with
pathologic enlargement are present. Lung windows demonstrate
changes of mild centrilobular emphysema at the apices, as well
as mild paraseptal emphysema, particularly along the right major
fissure. In addition, right lateral dependent change of
atelectasis are seen. A subpleural 2 cm region of ground-glass
opacity within the right upper lobe anteriorly, was not seen on
the prior examination, and could represent an atypical
infectious focus. The patient is status post sternal
debridement, and there is soft tissue density and mild stranding
between the two sides of the sternum.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a small hiatal
hernia. The upper-pole of the left kidney is quite atrophic in
appearance. Parenchymal calcifications along the pancreas are
consistent with chronic pancreatitis.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Several foci of air are seen
within the bladder, possibly between folds of the thickened
bladder wall. Note that the bladder seems more distended than we
would expect given the fact that the bladder is empty.There is
no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
Examination of the osseous structures show no suspicious lytic
or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION: 1. No definite infectious source is identified.
2. Ground-glass opacity along the anterior subpleural aspect of
the right upper lobe may represent an early or atypical
infectious process, although no definite consolidation is seen.
3. There is soft tissue density in the region of sternal
debridement. Given the lack of IV contrast, it is difficult to
assess for small abscess collections, although no dominant or
obvious fluid collection is seen. Given the history of
sternotomy, ultrasound may be useful for further evaluation of
the soft tissues for fluid collections.
4. The bladder wall also seems quite thickened considering that
it appears not distended with urine on this examination. There
are foci of air, probably trapped between fold
