Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]/MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year-old
female with multiple medical problems including end stage
renal disease on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure with
an EF of 45 to 50%, coronary artery disease, hypertension and
repeat admissions for congestive heart failure secondary to
hypovolemia who presents with shortness of breath on the
morning of admission.  The patient reports a hard time
sleeping on the night prior to admission and then at 5:00
a.m. developed dyspnea without chest pain, nausea, vomiting
or diaphoresis or other symptoms.  She denies fevers or
chills, night sweats, dietary indiscretions, and
noncompliance that would explain failure.  She is typically
dialyzed Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  Her blood pressure in
the Emergency Department was 210/100 and given intravenous
Hydralazine before being seen by the medicine team.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
2.  Type 2 diabetes.
3.  Congestive heart failure with an EF of 45 to 50% with
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
4.  Coronary artery disease with a stress MIBI in [**5-22**],
measured moderate distal anterior apical fixed perfusion
deficits.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Anemia.
7.  Gastroparesis.
8.  Right thalamic infarct in [**8-22**].

ALLERGIES:  Reglan.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Clonidine q Sunday.
2.  Aspirin 81 q.d.
3.  Norvasc 10 q.d.
4.  Metoprolol 50 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
5.  Lisinopril 40 q day.
6.  Atorvastatin 20 q.d.
7.  Protonix 40 q.d.
8.  Nitro patch .4 q 24.
9.  Insulin NPH and sliding scale.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 686**] originally
from [**Location (un) 4708**].  She denies tobacco and alcohol use.  She has
six children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient's
temperature was 99.5, pulse 85, blood pressure 198/72.
Respiratory rate 15.  98% on 4 liters.  General, this is a
somnolent woman in no acute distress.  Neck examination she
had JVD to the angle of the jaw.  Lungs had decreased breath
sounds bilaterally.  There is bibasilar crackles.  She was
dull to percussion at the bases.  Heart examination regular
rate and rhythm with occasional premature beats.  No murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count was 18.9 with 89% polys,
hematocrit 29.1, platelets 265.  Her chem 7 she had a sodium
of 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 90, bicarb 32, BUN 42,
creatinine 7.2, glucose 211.  She had a CK of 99, troponin of
.09.  Chest film she had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates,
cardiomegaly consistent with congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Later on the day of admission while
being previously stable she developed significant hypoxia
consistent with flash pulmonary edema.  Her blood pressure
escalated to approximately 260/110 with crackles throughout
her lung examination.  She developed pink frothy sputum and
sating at the mid 80s on 6 liters ultimately requiring a face
mask and sating better.  At this time there are several
therapies undergone.  She was given 80 mg of Lasix with poor
diuretic response.  Because the patient makes very little
urine as well as started on a nitroglycerin drip to lower
blood pressure.  She was also given a total of 8 mg of
morphine with significant improvement.  After these symptoms
began the Intensive Care Unit team was called and the
decision was made to put the patient on BiPAP and transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit.

During this time she was still hypertensive and the patient
was given intravenous Metoprolol.  ............ Service who
had earlier consulted on the patient was consulted again and
they deferred emergent dialysis pending more medical
management.  After increase in the nitroglycerin drip the
patient's blood pressure finally responded going under 180 to
190 with significant improvement in her symptoms and oxygen
saturation at this point.  She was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit and given BiPAP overnight.  Over the next
several days the patient underwent several rounds of
hemodialysis with ultra filtration prior to that to take off
more volume.  The plan was to over the next week and in
coming times to take off more fluid with dialysis likely
having an ultra filtration prior to actually initiating
hemodialysis.

By discharge the patient was in much better respiratory shape
with sating in the mid to high 90s on room air without any
dyspnea.

2.  Hypertension:  The patient presented with hypertensive
emergency.  She was started on Metoprolol q.d. instead of
three times a week and was discharged with Toprol XL 50 due
to heart failure.  Further cardiac workup was postponed for
several reasons.  For one she had a cardiac consult in [**Month (only) 116**],
which suggested that her previous MIBI scan was interpretable
and further study would require an MRI, which we did not have
at this institution.  In addition, the patient deferred
cardiac catheterization and so further ischemic workup was
not indicated.  The Clonidine patch, which she had been on
admission was discontinued and was replaced with Metoprolol.
This was in [**Location (un) **] the Renal Service who would like more room
with her blood pressure to take off fluid during dialysis and
ultra filtration.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 q.d.
2.  Lipitor 20 q.d.
3.  Amlodipine 10 q.d.
4.  Lisinopril 40 q.d.
5.  Protonix 40 q.d.
6.  Nitroglycerin tab prn.
7.  Toprol 50 q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypertensive emergency.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  End stage renal disease.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient will follow up with her
outpatient nephrologist and her primary care physician within
one week.  She will have outpatient VNA for physical therapy
and other services.
