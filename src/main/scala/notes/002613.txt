Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], where neurosurgery was
consulted. They recommended a repeat Head CT, and an MRI of the
head and C-spine with the patient to remain in a C-collar until
this had been done. The Head CT showed unchanged hemorrhages,
while the MRI of the brain was consistent with a bleed, and did
not show any underlying lesion. The MRI C-spine was unchanged
from previous and the patient's C-spine was subsequently
cleared. Plastic surgery recommended antibiotics for 7 days and
non operative management of the patient's orbital fracture. The
etiology of the patients' fall was discussed with cardiology -
they recommended an echocardiogram which showed significant L
ventricular outflow obstruction with an EF of 75%, with mild AR,
MR, and moderate TR. A CTA of the chest requested by cardiology
was also negative for PE. At this time, the cardiology service
recommended a further arrhythmia workup as an outpatient. The
patient is tolerating regular diet, having bowel function, and
was cleared to go home by physical therapy. She is therefore
being discharged to follow up with cardiology.
