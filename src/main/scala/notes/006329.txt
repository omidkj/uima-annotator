Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]-M

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old
Portugese-Creole speaking only woman who presented to the
[**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room on [**2130-3-3**], complaining of left lower quadrant abdominal pain,
sharp or knife-like in quality, which had begun the night
prior to admission and increased with bowel movements.  There
was no blood in the stool per the patient.  She denied
vaginal bleeding, urinary symptoms, dysuria, recent travel or
fevers.  In the Emergency Room, there was some question of
whether the patient was having chest pain and in fact the
patient was found to have a left bundle branch block with a
tachycardia superimposed to the 140 range.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was placed on a Diltiazem
drip as well as heparin and her systolic blood pressure at
one point was noted to be above 200, lowered to an acceptable
range.  She received chest CT scan for a question of a
pulmonary embolism and was sent initially to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for question of hypertensive crisis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  PPD positive.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Transient ischemic attacks.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (asthma), home O2.
7.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2121**], status post cholecystectomy.
8.  History of pulmonary embolism in [**2127**]; recently on
Coumadin for anti-coagulation.
9.  History of what were evidently had been multiple
myocardial infarctions.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
1.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  NPH [**5-16**].
3.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Klonopin 0.5 mg.
6.  Lipitor.
7.  Atenolol.
8.  Paxil, 10 mg q. day.
9.  Colace.
10. Diltiazem 120 mg p.o. twice a day.
11. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission in the
Emergency Department, the patient had vital signs noted 97.2
F., temperature; heart rate 139 decreasing to 110 on a
Diltiazem drip; blood pressure 180/120 decreasing to 145/61,
again on the Diltiazem drip; respiratory rate was 39; 99% was
the pulse oxygenation.  In general, a moderately obese woman
in respiratory distress.  She was noted to be normocephalic
with raccoon eyes.  Oropharynx was clear.  There were no
bruits appreciated.  No jugular venous distention was noted.
There was thought to be some accessory muscle use.  Breath
sounds were coarse at the bases with rare rales.  The patient
was, on cardiac examination, tachycardic.  S1 and S2 were
normal.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen was softly
distended with tenderness to palpation epigastrically and in
the left lower quadrant.  The rectal examination was negative
with no stool.  There is no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission to the Floor
some hours later was as follows:  Temperature 96.9 F.; blood
pressure 162/90; pulse 90; respirations 20; 96% on two
liters.  The patient speaking fluent Creole/Portugese,
however, not clearly oriented to place or time, although
difficulties with initial interpretation.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Pupils equally round and reactive to
light bilaterally and directly and consensually with fundi
obscured bilaterally with cataracts.  Extraocular movements
did not show evidence for nystagmus.  There was some left
conjunctival hemorrhage.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Racoon's eyes were noted again bilaterally without battle
signs.  Tympanic membranes were poorly visualized, but there
was no clear evidence for hemotympanum.  The neck was supple.
There was no jugular venous distention.  Cardiac examination
was unremarkable.  The chest was clear with a left sided
pleural rub heard throughout the left side of the chest.  The
abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds, not
significantly distended, but some minor tenderness to
palpation in the left lower quadrant.  There was a bruise of
the right shin and the left heel appeared to be between 1 and
3 cm lower than the right.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC was as follows at admission, 7.7 was
the white blood cell count, hematocrit 41.7, with 67%
neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes.  Platelet count
of 214.  PT on admission was 16.1, with an INR of 1.8.  PTT
was 26.9.  Urinalysis was negative.

Chem-7 at time of admission showed a sodium of 141, potassium
of 3.7, chloride 101, bicarbonate 29, BUN 22, creatinine of
1.1, glucose 368 at first measure.

Cardiac enzymes were repeatedly cycled with values all within
the 20 to 25 range.  Troponin were less than or equal to 0.4.
Amylase was 190; lipase of 20, ALT 18, AST 18, alkaline
phosphatase 117, total bilirubin 0.4, albumin 3.2, calcium
9.0, phosphate 2.8, magnesium 1.7.  TSH is pending at the
time of discharge.

Stool studies are pending at the time of discharge.

Urine culture showed 10 to 100,000 organisms of Proteus
mirabilis.

Chest x-ray on [**3-3**], was as follows:  No acute
cardiopulmonary process.  A chest CT scan performed on the
same day showed no pulmonary embolus, left pleural and
parenchymal calcifications and left lower lobe volume loss,
i.e. fibrothorax from prior inflammatory process as well as
traction bronchiectasis.

The head CT scan was performed on [**3-4**], with the
following impression:  No intracranial hemorrhage, no
evidence of skull fracture.

Hip x-rays are pending at the time of this dictation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with the above-stated complaints on a
heparin drip as well as a Diltiazem drip.  The patient's
cardiac issues rapidly settled with the patient once again
developing a regular rate.  The patient's EKG was felt to
represent tachycardia with left bundle branch block but
without other pathology.  The patient ruled out by cardiac
enzymes.  Once the patient was stabilized, the patient was
rapidly transferred to the Floor for further management.

Secondary to concerns surrounding the additional history that
the patient gave of a fall approximately three days prior to
admission with racoon's eyes on examination, the patient was
sent for a CT scan of the head to rule out intra-cranial
bleeding or base of the skull fracture.  This study was
negative.

In the absence of evidence to suggest acute cardiac process,
heparin was discontinued.  Stool studies were sent which are
pending at the time of this discharge.  The patient's urine
did grow out between 10 and 100,000 organisms of Proteus
mirabilis as stated above.  On [**3-4**], the patient was
thought to be much improved with no significant abdominal
tenderness and no Telemetry events overnight with a pulse in
the 80s and systolic blood pressure in the 160s.  As the
patient had formerly multiple times been evaluated for
abdominal pain including mesenteric angiography and CT scan
of the abdomen without a diagnosis being reached, the
decision was made to discharge the patient home or
appropriate outpatient follow-up with her outpatient
provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8499**].
