CXR: FINDINGS: Single AP portable view of the chest is compared
to previous exam from [**2137-4-24**]. Given the limitations of
the portable film with respiratory motion, the lungs are grossly
clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Osseous and soft
tissue structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT head w/o contrast: No definite acute intracranial process,
although the exam is severely limited by motion artifact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] is a 58 year old female with history of poorly
controlled type 1 diabetes, gastroparesis, CVA, HTN, Hep C, and
multiple prior admissions for DKA presenting with DKA in the
setting of missing [**Known lastname 31217**] doses.

# DKA/Type I diabetes - Patient presented with elevated sugars
in the 700s, anion gap of 39, ketonuria. Precipitant most likely
due to patient not taking her [**Known lastname 31217**] correctly as she admitted
to skipping her dose the evening prior and morning of admission.
Other possible triggers considered were infection given
leukocytosis however patient afebrile and workup unrevealing.
Patient r/o MI. Tox screen only positive for benzos (given in
the ED). Patient was given 8 units of [**Known lastname 31217**] as bolus then
started on [**Known lastname 31217**] drip in the ED prior to transfer to the MICU.
Patient was aggressively hydrated and continued on [**Known lastname 31217**] drip
until her anion gap closed. [**Known lastname **] drip was stopped and patient
was restarted on her home dose of [**Known lastname 31217**]. Her electrolytes were
closely monitored and repleted appropriately. Her blood sugars
remained difficult to control as patient is sensitive to
[**Known lastname 31217**], but does not eat consistent [**Known lastname 16429**] and sometimes has
late night snack around 10 or midnight.  She is not consistent
enough to teach carb counting.  While on the floor, blood sugars
