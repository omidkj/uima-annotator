History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 48422**] is a 36-year-old man with a history of metastatic,
dedifferentiated thyroid cancer on doxarubucin (C1D18) and
celiac disease, presenting with one day of headache and altered
mental status. Patient developed a headache after using a
suppository for constipation yesterday. He has had several weeks
of low grade temperatures to 99.5 and night sweats. This
morning, he was noted by his family to not be making any sense
when they were speaking with him. He states he was having
difficulty word finding, following commands, and writing
sentences at that time. It resolved, but re-occured during his
appointment with his oncologist later that day. He was referred
to the ED where his symptoms resolved again, but then
re-occurred in the ED where he was noted to be having difficulty
finding words, making paraphrasic errors, and appearing overall
globally confused. He has been on dexamethasone daily and his
last chemotherapy was cycle 1 day 1 of doxorubicin on [**2117-8-3**].
.
In ED VS were 98.9 103 123/82 14 100% on RA. Labs sig for Na of
123, Hct of 22.7, WBC of 9.9 with 15% bands. Lactate 0.8 He
received IV Vancomycin, CFTX, and Acylovir (meningitis dosing)
and 3 L NS. Neurology and neurosurgery were both consulted.
Neurosurgery did not recommend any intervention for the SDH
noted on Head CT, stating it was subacute. Neurology recommended
LP for rule out meningitis which was performed in the ED and
demonstrated WBC of 8, normal protein and glucose, and RBCS that
did not clear from tube 1->tube 4.

tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History (Per Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 11574**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note):
-[**2103**]: Nodule felt on physical examination, biopsy revealed
papillary thyroid cancer and patient underwent a total
thyroidectomy. Per reports, patient had 1.1 cm tumor with lymph
node involvement. This was done in [**Location (un) 36413**]. He underwent
radioactive iodine therapy, and was followed frequently with lab
tests and scans. Abnormalities were detected in [**2107**] with
evidence of possible remnant thyroid tissue, and he underwent
repeat radioactive iodine ablation with good result. Was
followed closely for a time, had last been seen in [**2113**] when he
lived in [**Location 18296**], and was lost to follow up until move to
[**State 350**] in [**2115**].
-As part of initial evaluation, he had an ultrasound done of his
neck. The ultrasound demonstrated three enlarged morphologically
abnormal lymph nodes on the left at level IV and further
evaluation was recommended. The largest lymph node was 1.9 x 1.7
x 1.0 cm. He then underwent a Thyrogen radioactive iodine uptake
scan, which was negative for residual thyroid uptake and had no

evidence of metastatic disease. He subsequently went on to an
ultrasound-guided biopsy and cytology from this procedure was
positive for malignant cells consistent with carcinoma. The
malignant cells had a large nuclei with prominent nucleoli and
high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios. The tumor cells were
positive for CK7 and CK20, and negative for TTF-1 and
thyroglobulin. These findings were consistent with
dedifferentiated papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, but second
primary could not be entirely excluded. As a result of this
pathology, the patient underwent PET-CT scan, which demonstrated
FDG avid nodal disease in the left neck at levels IV and IIa
within the right thyroidectomy bed. There was atypical diffuse
FDG avid nodal disease within the thorax along the periaortic
and paraesophageal chain. The findings were consistent
suggestive of dedifferentiated metastatic thyroid cancer;
however, the pattern was atypical. There were no other sites of
abnormal FDG uptake to suggest a secondary malignancy. Biopsy of
the paraesophageal mass on [**2-17**] with pathology consistent with
his previously diagnosed, dedifferentiated papillary thyroid
carcinoma. Lastly, his PET/CT scan in [**2117-5-20**] revealed stable
disease.
.
Other Past Medical History:
Celiac disease

Social History:
The patient works as a consultant. His girlfriend and mother are
present at the bedside. He does not smoke. Occasional EtOH use,
none in last 5 weeks. Denies any illicit drug use.


Family History:
Mother had papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Father died of
colon cancer at age 63, was diagnosed at age 57. He has a
brother and a sister who are healthy. His family history is
significant for heart disease, specifically CHF.
