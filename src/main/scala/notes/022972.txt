CT Abd/Pelvis on [**2192-9-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Abdominal aortic aneurysms, as detailed, which are larger in
size from
[**2191-4-21**]. Extensive atheromas throughout the aorta with
ulcerated plaque
at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus, unchanged from prior
study.

2. Multiple abdominal wall defects, including a small hernia
containing non-
obstructed small bowel and a small left upper abdominal
[**Doctor Last Name 6261**] hernia
containing a small portion of transverse colon.

3. Minimally prominent left intrahepatic biliary ducts and CBD.
No
obstructing lesion is identified. Recommend correlation with
LFTs, although
no significant change is noted.

4. Enlarged and bulky uterus with foci of calcifications, likely
reflects a
fibroid uterus, similar to before.

5. Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with central canal
narrowing at
L4-L5. This can be further evaluated with an MRI if there is
persistent
clinical concern for a cause of back pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yof with history of HTN, COPD, severe PUD (gastric and
duodenal), recent admission in [**7-26**] for chest pain that had a
negative work up who presents with one week of worsening left
low back/buttock pain without radiation, no numbness, tingling.

#  Low Back/Buttock Pain:  On initial exam, pain was very
focused over left buttock and low back and she denied any
radiation of her pain.  The straight leg raise was difficult to
assess as she was unable to lie on her back due to pain.  She
was started on a llidocaine patch, tylenol 650mg q6h, tramadol
50mg q6h prn, and morphine 0.5-1mg IV prn for breakthrough pain.
 She slept well overnight and on [**9-3**] a more thorough exam was
illicted.  She continued to have tenderness to palpation over
left buttock with some radiation to upper thigh.  Pain in that
location was reproduced with SLR and crossed SLR, but the pain
did not radiate below the upper thigh.  She denied any
numbness/tingling, and sensation was intact.  Her rectal tone
was normal.  After touching base with her attending, the most
likely diagnosis was considered to be sciatic pain.  Due to
hypotension and decreased mental status (see below) pt. was
triggered and spent one night in the MICU.  This was thought to
be narcotic induced and received Narcan x 2.  She improved and
in discussion with attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on the morning of
[**2192-9-5**],  Ultram was stopped and ibuprofen was started despite
risk of bleeding due to the fact that the benefits outweighed
the risk (her GI bleed was many years ago and because she has
been on PPIs it was felt that she could tolerate NSAIDS).  Her
pain became tolerable.  She was continued on Tylenol, Ibuprofen,
Neurontin, and lidoderm patches.

#  Blood Pressure Changes:  Pt. had poorly controlled HTN on
last admission which was thought to be part of the cause for her
chest pain at that time.  Pressure was 178/100 when she was
admitted to the floor, but she had not received any of her home
medications.  She had been recently discharged on Lisinopril,
HCTZ, and Metoprolol which were continued.  At  20:00 on
[**2192-9-2**], it came down to 134/64.  The patient was triggered at
about 15:
