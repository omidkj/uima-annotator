Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2101-1-24**] Mitral valve replacement(27mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine)
and single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting utilizing the
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 year old female with known history of coronary
artery disease,  mitral regurgitation and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She presented to [**Hospital1 **] complaining of acute
shortness of breath awakening her from sleep. Chest x-ray at
that time was consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG showed normal
sinus rhythm. Symptoms did improve with diuresis. Subsequent
cardiac catheterization revealed a 60% in-stent stenosis in the
proximal LAD stent and a patent RCA stent. The circumflex was
noted to have only a 50% lesion. Left ventriculography confirmed
4+ mitral regurgitation and estimated LV function around 60%.
Based upon the above results, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac surgical intervention. Prior to transfer, she was
started on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.

Past Medical History:
Congestive heart failure, Coronary artery disease - History of
Coronary Stents(LAD & RCA) in [**2094**], Mitral regurgitation,
Paroxsymal Atrial fibrillation/flutter, Type II Diabetes
mellitus; Hypertension, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,
Hypercholesterolemia, Pulmonary Hypertension; History of GI
bleed and Peptic Ulcer Disease, History of Bradycardia - s/p
Pacemaker Implantation, Anemia, Hypothyroidism

Social History:
Married, lives alone. She does not smoke or drink alcohol.

Family History:
Denies history of premature coronary artery disease

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
3. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good l
