History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male with PMH significant for CAD
with 2 prior bypass surgeries and 2 PCIs, PAD s/p carotid
stenting and per patient b/l LE bypass, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, chronic stable angina who presented with
shortness of breath in the setting of recent percutaneous aortic
valve placement at [**Hospital 69016**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 311**].

This hospitalization is the continuation of an extensive disease
course. He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] recently between [**9-10**] and
[**9-11**] after VF arrest during a board meeting. He underwent CPR
with shock, was rapidly intubated and then extubated. He had
subsequent chest pain with EKG changes that led to
catheterization; Catheterization demonstrated patent stents and
LIMA and prominent severe AR.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 3278**] because his primary cardiology, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 14714**] is there. A single lead ICD was placed on [**2136-8-17**]; the
patient was discharged to home but sustained two further
ventricular fibrillation arrests. He was readmitted to [**Hospital1 3278**]
with SOB; during that admission he underwent a CT angiogram as
part of preparation for transcatheter aortic valve implantation
which resulted in contrast nephropathy. The patient was
transported on [**2136-9-23**] to [**Location (un) 311**] for TAVI procedure
(transcatheter placement of aortic valve) at [**Hospital 69016**]
Hospital. On arrival to [**Location (un) 311**] he had continued SOB with
singifcant peripheral edema. TAVI was performed on [**2136-9-26**]. He
was in complete heart block after the procedure and so his
single chamber ICT was upgraded to a dual chamber ICD. Of note,
ASA and Plavix were held on transfer from [**Location (un) 311**] back to [**Hospital1 3278**]
out of concern for dropping HCT. He was diuresed after the
procedure, but per notes continued to have some SOB upon
transfer back to [**Hospital1 3278**].

At [**Hospital1 3278**], he continued to be diuresed, and was discharged
yesterday morning. Of note, during that hospitalization the
patient requireed several blood transfusions for anemia; one
source was epistaxis.

After discharge, he immediately tried to walk around his house
and had an episode of SOB after walking that took one hour to
resolve yesterday. The patient's wife started giving him
continuous oxygen from 2L to 4L. He did not have any chest pain
during this episode. He denies any changes in his bowel or urine
habits. Again this morning around 9:30 AM, he had extreme SOB,
this time with minimal exertion when moving from bed to a chair.
This time he felt dizzy but did not have syncope and again had
no chest pain.

In the ED, initial VS were 98 111/45 16 97% 10L. The patient was
started on a Lasix bolus with drip and placed on BiPAP. His
breathing improved during his ED stay. CXR showed pulmonary
edema with possible consolidation; he was given Lasix 40 IV x1.
In the setting of WBC 20, Vancomycin was started.

STUDIES:

CT Ab/Pelvis [**10-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal or other hematoma. Small
region of
stranding in the right groin may relate to recent
catheterization.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis, and pulmonary
edema.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Atherosclerotic disease, infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysmal dilation
(2.7 cm). Apparent aneurysmal dilation at origin of bilateral
common femoral
grafts. Correlation with surgical history and any possibly
available prior
contrast enhanced studies is recommended. Evaluation of
vasculature is limited
on this noncontrast examination.
5. Small bilateral adrenal adenomas vs. nodular hyperplasia.

ECHO [**10-7**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. A well-seated CoreValve bioprosthetic
aortic valve is seen with mobile leaflets. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a prominent anterior fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well-seated CoreValve
bioprosthesis with normal gradient and mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
If clinically indicated, a formal complete study by lab
personnel may be useful in better defining the source of aortic
regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old male with PMH significant for CAD with 2 prior
bypass surgeries and 2 PCIs, PAD s/p carotid stenting and per
patient b/l LE bypass, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic
stable angina who presented with shortness of breath in the
setting of recent percutaneous aortic valve placement at [**Hospital 69017**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 311**].

His shortness of breath was attributed to PNA in the setting of
NSTEMI given rising enzymes; in addition he was thought to have
some fluid overload from a CHF exacerbation and was initially
given Lasix in the ED. On presentation, he also had an anion gap
metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate & uremia that was
thought to be due to infection; this was accompanied by
transaminitis and acute renal failure. Antibiotics were started.
A CT was done on admission to rule out RP bleed given there had
been a concern for anemia at an OSH and the patient was
complaining of severe back pain. After this was negative for
bleed, heparin drip was started for NSTEMI.

Throughout the evening, the patient developed increasing signs
and symptoms of cardiogenic shock with worsening shortness of
breath and hypotension. CPAP and BiPAP were attempted with only
temporary relief. The patient was finally intubated with the
intention of central line placement for blood pressure support.
However, immediately after intubation he developed PEA arrest.
The patient underwent two sessions of CPR for a total of 1.5
hours, regaining a pulse for only a 10 minute period between
sessions. The patient expired at 4 AM on [**2136-10-8**].
