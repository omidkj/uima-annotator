Constipation and Urinary Retention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
46 female who was recently diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer
(invasive ductal carcinoma) with lumbar metastases s/p debulking
and fixation who was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] the
week prior to presentation. The patient was feeling well for
several days when she began to feel as if her bladder was
distended. The patient's foley was subsequently replaced for
relief of the urinary retention. The patient had some opioid and
hypercalcemia-related constipation on her prior hospitalziation.
She was given an aggressive bowel regimen throughout that
hospitalization and continued to have regular but small bowel
movements. By report, the patient did not have bowel movement
for several days at the rehab facility and had no response to a
suppository. The patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of
her constipation. On presentation, the patient reported no bowel
movement for several days with some associated abdominal pain
and at least one episode of vomiting. She reported that she has
continued to pass flatus. She denied any recent fevers, chills.
She reported ongoing back and leg pain consistent with what she
as experiencing at her last discharge. She further denied any
chest pain or shortness of breath.
.
In ED VS were T:98.5, HR:86, BP:105/64, RR:18, SO2:98%. The
patient was complaining of constipation in the ED. She had soft
brown stool in the rectal vault that was slightly guaiac
positive by report. A KUB revealed stool but no evidence of
obstruction and a CXR showed no free air under the diaphragm.
The patient was admitted to the medicine service for treatment
of her urinary retention and constipation.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 year-old female with recent diagnosis of stage IV breast
cancer (invasive ductal cell carcinoma) who presented with
constipation likely due to opioids with hypercalcemia and was
transferred to OMED for initiation of XRT
.
#. Constipation: Patient with difficulties with constipation
during prior admission which were initially attributed to
hypercalcemia, likely in combination with opiates. KUB without
evidence of obstruction and CXR without evidence of free air
under the diaphragm on this admission.  She was continued on an
aggressive bowel regimen including colace, senna, miralax,
lactulose with good response.  Abdominal exam still with
distension on discharge but markedly improved.  She was
monitored for obstruction and showed no signs of this.
.
# Hypercalcemia:  Likely d/t metastatic disease.  Corrected
calcium as high as 12.3 on admission, but trended down to 11.12
on discharge.  She was continued on IV fluids for this which
good response and no signs of fluid overload.  She also received
pamidronate x 1 on [**12-13**] and [**12-20**], and could receive this again
every 7 days for further control of her hypercalcemia.  She will
also continue calcitonin 200U intranasal q12h.  She should
continue to be maintained on NS at 125cc/hr while at rehab, and
calciums should be followed every three days to guide further
treatment.
.
#. Metastatic Breast Cancer:  Patient with diagnosis of invasive
ductal carcinoma on previous admission, ER/PR+.  She is s/p
lumbar debulking and fixation for lumbar mets on [**12-2**] and
[**12-3**]. She developed seroma in incision site at on her back
which was tapped by orthopedics, on discharge still has non
tense seroma w/o signs of infection or inflammation. Staples
were removed on day of discharge and orthopedic follow up was
arranged. She was transferred to the oncology floor for
expedition of XRT which was she recieved [**12-20**] and [**12-21**] and
will continue daily for a total of 5 treatments. She was also
followed by wound care and should continue local treatment for
her breast per wound-care recommendations as outlined below. She
is continued on dexamethasone 4 mg PO Q6H. Hormonal therapy with
Arimidex (anastrozole) 1mg daily was started and should be
continued post-discharge. She will continue follow-up with her
oncologist.
.
#. Pain:  Pt with abdominal pain as well as left groin pain over
admission. We increased MS Contin from 90 mg to 120mg PO Q8H for
basal pain control, and PRN dilaudid PO 2-4mg Q6h for
breakthrough pain. She may continue to get IV dialudid 2-4mg Q6h
for pain that is not responsive to IV meds. She was maintained
on aggressive bowel regimen as above.
.
#. Anemia: Hematocrit on last admission was 35.9 with an unknown
baseline. Hct remained stable on this admission from 33-36.  DIC
labs were negative on prior admission and iron studies last
admission c/w AoCD
.
#. Leukocytosis: WBC 17.3 on admission, which trended to 14.2 on
discharge.  She did not have localizing infectious symptoms and
CXR and UA negative for infection.  We attributed her
leukocytosis to her dexamethasone.
.
# Transaminitis:  likely [**2-23**] mets, trended down throughout
admission
.
#Lumbar fluid collection:  as mentioned above Pt developed a
non-tender, fluid filled
