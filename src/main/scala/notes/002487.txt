PROCEDURE DATE: [**2135-5-28**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Ventricular fibrillation. ST segment elevation MI.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute PCI of
the
RCA.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two vessel
coronary
artery disease in this right dominant circulation. The LMCA was
without
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The LAD was
diffusely
calcififed with a 70% mid-vessel stenosis and a 40%
distal-vessel
stenosis. The D1 had a 60% stenosis at the origin. The LCX had a
40%
mid-vessel stenosis. The OM branches were without flow limiting
disease.
The RCA had a 100% proximal vessel occlusion followed by an 80%
mid
vessel stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics from right heart catetheterization
demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures
(RVEDP=14mmHg and mean PCWP=17mmHg). Cardiac output and index
were
preserved at 10.2 L/min and 6.4 L/min/m2 respectively.
3. Left ventriculogram not performed to reduce contrast load.
4. Successful PCI of the proximal and mid RCA with two
overlapping
Cypher DES (2.5 x 13 mm and 2.5 x 28 mm), post-dilated with a
2.75 mm
balloon.
5. Successful RFA arteriotomy closure with a 6 French Angioseal
device.

TTE [**2135-5-30**]
LVEF 50.  TR 37.  The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include basal inferoseptal and basal to mid
inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated
anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].  On entry to the room, she
arrested with VF.  The patient was shocked at 200J and
immediately cardioverted to sinus.  She then began to scream and
thrash before returning to VF.  She was again shocked and again
began to scream and thrash.  This was repeated for a total of
five cardioversions.  Lidocaine was then administered.  The
patient was sedated, paralyzed and intubated and urgent cardiac
catheterization was peformed.  This revealed complete occlusion
of the RCA which was revascularized with a cypher.  There was an
approximatley 60% lesion of the LAD.  The plan for this lesion
is outpatient stress test for consideration of future
revascularization.  Echocardiography was performed revealing
LVEF>55% and basal inferoseptal and basal to mid inferior
hypokinesis.  The patient was started on ASA and plavix and we
titrated up his BB and added ACE inhibition.  His VF was felt
[**1-12**] ischemia, so no further anti-arrhythmic was used.  His TG
was found to be 342 so gemfibrizol was initiated; the next day,
on further consideration, the team decided to maximize statin
with consideration of further treatment as OP.
.
The patient was discharged to home with recommendation of cards
rehab to PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22552**] in [**Hospital1 **] who patient gives us
permission to contact.  We faxed a DC summary to him.  The
patient requested to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for cardiology FU; this was
arranged.
