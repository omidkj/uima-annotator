Brief Hospital Course:
In brief the patient is a 39 year old woman with AML s/p related
allo-PSCT, chronic GVHD, CAD s/p MI, DM who is admitted to ICU
for close monitoring given bilateral PEs and hypotension on
presentation.
.
# PE. The patient with bilateral PEs and R common femoral
thrombus documented on the OSH CTA. Trop <0.01. Currently HD
stable.
- She was initially put on supplemental oxygen and started on a
continuous IV heparin infusion for anticoagulation.  Per her
primary oncologist, her clopidogrel was stopped since she was
>11 months out from stenting given the bleeding risk with
additional anticoagulation.  Upon transfer out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her
heparin was transitioned to enoxaparin 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] for long-term
anticoagulation.  Her supplemental oxygen was very slowly weaned
off.  She was seen by physical therapy who initially recommended
rehab; the patient adamantly and consistently refused rehab
placement.  The patient's strength gradually improved to the
point where she was cleared by PT for discharge home with
continued home PT.  Upon discharge, she wsa completely off of
supplemental oxygen and able to ambulate with a walker.
.
# Hypotension/tachycardia.
- Her CCB and beta blocker were initially held while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
due to hypotension.  Upon transfer out, her BP was stable and
she was resumed on her home dose of beta blocker for rate
control of her chronic sinus tachycardia.  She was kept on
telemetry on the floor for several days until her sinus
tachycardia was adequately controlled.
.
# CAD: hx of STEMI s/p PCI with stents. EKG with ST depressions.

- She was continued on her beta blocker as above.  She was
continued on aspirin and her statin.  Her clopidogrel was held
as above since she was 11 months out from stenting and since her
new enoxaparin therapy would be further increasing her risk of
bleeding.
.
# DM2
- Her Lantus dose was increased to 40u QAM (from a home dose of
20u) upon admission to the ICU.  The was continued while on the
floor due to her elevated steroid dose.  As her steroids were
tapered back to her home dose, her Lantus was gradually tapered.
 She was discharged on 25u QAM.
