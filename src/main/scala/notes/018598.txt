[**2122-10-20**] CXR
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right,
increased since [**10-16**]. Moderate-to-severe enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette may be due in part to pericardial
effusion, but there is no substantial azygous distention to
suggest hemodynamic significance. Left basal atelectasis
increased due to pleural effusion. Upper lungs clear. No
pulmonary edema.

centimeters, 0.25% Marcaine, no epinephrine, infiltration and
block followed by development of flaps and elevation with
teeth #17, #18, #19, #29, #30, #32 and #5 with the use of
periosteal elevators and forceps, [**Doctor Last Name **] drill and elevated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiac surgical intensive
care unit on [**2122-10-20**] for further management of her atrial
fibrillation. The EP service was consulted and amiodarone and
beta blockade were continued. Heparin was started for
anticoagulation. Diuresis was initiated as she had bilateral
pleural effusions and peripheral edema. A chest tube was placed
in her right pleura which drained 450ml. The oral surgery
service was consulted for her teeth extraction which was
originally planned for her last admission. Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to
have runs of rapid atrial fibrillation alternating with pauses
and sinus bradycardia. The EP service recommended placement of a
permenant pacemaker for adequate treatment of her atrial
fibrillation. On [**2122-10-23**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] placement of a
dual chamber pacemaker without complication. Postoperatively she
was sent to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further
recovery. Her teeth were sxtracted on [**2122-10-25**] without issue.
Coumadin and heparin were then resumed. She continued to require
aggressive diuresis but responded well to metolazone and lasix.
Her INR was 2.6 on [**2122-10-27**] (up from 1.3 on day prior) and her
coumadin was held. INR on [**10-28**] was 3 and she was given 0.5 mg PO
coumadin per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She remained stable and was discharged
to rehab on [**2122-10-28**].
