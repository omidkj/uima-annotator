History of Present Illness:
62 yo male with history of ESRD [**2-5**] anti-GBM disease on
peritoneal dialysis, CAD, OA, COPD on chronic steroids and
dementia, who presents with N/V, diarrhea, abdominal pain and
chest pain. His wife reports that at 5pm on [**7-14**], he had the
chills with a temp of 99.1. She reports chronic nonbloody
diarrhea, but today had NBNB emesis and lower abdominal pain.
She drained his abdomen at home. Of note, at baseline, he is
incontinent of urine and stool, and is only able to answer some
questions given his baseline dementia. EMS brought the patient
to ED, on arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt began experiencing chest pain but
denied SOB. He reportedly has a chronic nonproductive smoker's
cough which was at its baseline.
In the ED, initial vitals were 5 97.8 98 112/59 18 96% ra. The
peritoneal fluid drained and sent off was cloudy. Pressures were
initially in the low 100's and he was given fluids. He then
dropped his pressures to the 80's. Given his bandemia, he was
given empiric vanc/zosyn. He was also noted to be hypoglycemic
with a rising lactate from 4 to 7. He had trouble lying flat and
became tachypneic with persistent cough. CXR with questionable
evidence of pneumonia, so he was intubated without issue with a
glide scope and succinylcholine/etomidate. He has been
intermittently on and off neosynephrine which was chosen as he
was tachycardic. EKG revealed a RBBB which was thought secondary
to demand given elevated trop and neg CKMB. ABG was notable for
a mixed acidosis. Central venous access was attempted at the
right IJ which was complicated by arterial puncture. A CVL was
placed in the left IJ. He was given 50 hydrocort for stress dose
given home steroids. Renal was contact[**Name (NI) **] re: likely peritonitis
from PD catheter, and commented to consider intraperitoneal but
hold for now. Transplant [**Doctor First Name **] recs: Not on transplant list,
removed for non-compliance issues, NPO, IVF, treat bacterial
peritonitis with IV abx, trend lactates to make sure trending
down, ?colitis is mild, should send stool cultures and C.diff.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2195-7-20**]**

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2195-7-20**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other
fungi.
         FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in
MCG/ML
