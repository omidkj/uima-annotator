Pertinent Results:
Cardiac cath [**2149-7-22**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
mild
coronary artery disease. The [**Month/Day/Year **] had a 20% ostial lesion. The
LAD and LCx had mild diffuse disease. The RCA had a 50% ostial
stenosis with mild plaquing in the mid-vessel.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right sided
filling
pressures (RA mean 10 mm Hg, RVEDP 11 mm Hg). There was moderate

pulmonary hypertension (PASP 47 mm Hg). Left sided filling
pressures
were also elevated (LVEDP 24 mm Hg and PCWP mean 23 mm Hg).
There was
mild systemic arterial hypertension (SBP 143 mm Hg). There was a
peak
gradient of 97 mm Hg across the aortic valve from the LV to the
[**Month/Day/Year 5236**]
with a calculated valve area of 0.6 cm2. The cardiac index was
slightly depressed (2.5 l/min/m2). The SVR was elevated (1566
dynes-sec/cm5) and PVR was low (34 dynes-sec/cm5).
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Critical aortic stenosis.
2. Mild diffuse, non-flow limiting coronary artery disease.
3. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
5. Mildly depressed cardiac index.

Echo at OSH [**2149-7-17**] nl mitral and tricuspid valves. moderately
calcified tricuspid aortic valve, mild AI, arotic gradient peak

mild concentric LVH, EF>60%
.
Echo at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2149-7-24**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic systolic function. Severe aortic stenosis.

Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST

INDICATION: 78-year-old man post-aortic valve replacement, CABG.
Followup
effusions.

COMPARISON: Several prior studies, most recent dated [**2149-7-29**].

FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Lung volumes are
improved but
still low, bibasilar atelectasis present. Small bilateral
pleural effusions
are again noted. There is no pulmonary edema. There is no
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the chest with bibasilar
atelectasis and
small pleural effusions. No evidence of pulmonary edema.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
