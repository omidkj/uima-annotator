Pertinent Results:
[**2125-6-11**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: TRAUMA
Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY

INDICATION: 74-year-old man with trauma.

TECHNIQUE: After administration of IV contrast, a multidetector
scanner was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the
thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis. These were then
reconfigured and reformatted into coronal and sagittal planes.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is intubated.
There is a moderate right pneumothorax and a small left apical
pneumothorax. Additionally, some mediastinal air is identified.
Bilateral chest tubes are seen; the one on the right traverses
through the lung parenchyma and enters the posterior pleural
space. The left chest tube also traverses through the lung, and
ending adjacent to the pericardium; as previously stated, there
is only a small left posterior apical pneumothorax. Small
bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are seen.
A minor amount of air extends below the crus of the diaphragm,
in association with the mediastinal air. Extensive subcutaneous
emphysema is seen on the right; only a small amount is seen on
the left. The heart and great vessels are unremarkable; no
dissection or pulmonary embolism is identified. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A small low density lesion
is seen at the dome of the liver, which is too small to
characterize, but probably represents a cyst. Two small low
density lesions are seen on the right kidney, also too small to
characterize, but probably representing cysts. Both kidneys have
extrarenal pelves. The spleen, adrenals, and pancreas are
unremarkable. An NG tube is seen coiling in the stomach, ending
in the pylorus. The imaged bowel is unremarkable, and there is
no evidence of vascular compromise. Of note, the infrarenal
abdominal aorta is dilated to a maximum diameter of 5.0 x 5.4
cm; there is no evidence of dissection, and the abdominal aorta
returns to normal caliber at the bifurcation; however, both
iliac arteries are ectatic and mildly dilated. Vascular
calcification is seen. Also of note is a moderately stenotic but
patent superior mesenteric artery. There is a small amount of
fatty infiltration around the gallbladder.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: No fluid is seen within the
pelvis. Diverticulosis is present, without evidence of
diverticulitis. The collapsed bladder has a thickened wall. A
Foley is present. There is an enlarged prostate and
fat-containing small inguinal hernias.

Several rib fractures are identified on the right, including the
anterolateral aspects of #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, and the
anterior aspect of the left second rib, in two places. With the
left rib fractures, there is a small amount of associated
hematoma in the chest wall, and subcutaneous emphysema.

There is a small amount of stranding in the right inguinal
region, consistent with the patient's recent arterial phlebotomy
in that region.

Coronal and sagittal reconfigurations were essential in
establishing the diagnoses above (MPR value 4).

IMPRESSION:
1. No findings to explain patient's hypotension.

2. Bilateral pneumothoraces and mediastinal air, with multiple
bilateral rib fractures and subcutaneous air, right greater than
left. Chest tubes are also malpositioned. Small bilateral
pleural effusions and dependent atelectasis.

3. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm dilated to a maximum
diameter of 5.4 cm, without evidence of dissection. Vascular
calcification in the aorta and iliac arteries.

[**2125-6-11**] CT C-SPINE: No fracture is seen. There is separation of
the left C3-4 facet joint, possibly representing ligamentous
disruption. Degenerative changes are seen at multiple levels.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The patient is
intubated, and a small amount of fluid is noted around the ET
tube. Bilateral apical pneumothoraces are noted in the
visualized portion of the lung apices.

MRI [**2125-6-13**] of Cervical and thoracic spine. FINDINGS: The
widened left C3-4 facet joint space is again demonstrated, with
irregularity of the joint space surfaces that correlate with the
recent CT scan. The STIR images do not appear to show contiguous
edema of the surrounding soft tissues. There is mild infolding
of the ligamentum flavum at the C5-6 and C6-7 interspace levels.
The bony central spinal canal is quite capacious. Uncovertebral
spurring produces moderate right-sided neural foraminal
narrowing at C5-6. There is a longitudinally extensive but
relatively thin (2 mm to 3 mm) prevertebral soft tissue swelling
anterior to the odontoid process and extending down to the C3-4
level. This finding is suspicious for ligamentous injury
involving the anterior longitudinal ligament. Adjacent to this
region is a 2 cm mass with low T1 and high T2 signal within the
midline posterior nasopharyngeal soft tissues. The finding is
suspicious for a large Tornwaldt cyst.

CONCLUSION: Continued demonstration of distraction of the left
C3-4 facet joint complex. The finding could represent a local
injury, although the irregularity of the bone surfaces seems
more in keeping with a degenerative arthritic process. However,
there is prevertebral soft tissue swelling in the upper cervical
spine, suspicious for ligamentous injury. The findings, as well
as the additional observations noted above were discussed in
detail with the trauma resident.

MR scan of the thoracic spine was performed using sagittal T1
and T2-weighted images.

FINDINGS: There are somewhat linear regions of elevated T2
signal within the upper three thoracic vertebral bodies.
However, there is no definite sign of deformation of these
bodies to indicate an overt compression fracture. Clearly, when
the patient becomes conscious, a detailed physical examination
of this area as well as the cervical spine will help to
determine whether these findings of abnormal signal could
indicate rather subtle trauma. The thoracic spinal canal is
capacious. There is no definite sign of spinal cord abnormality
appreciated. Within the limits of sagittal imaging, no gross
paraspinal pathology is apparent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admission to [**2125-6-18**]:

After arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was stabilized and
transferred to the trauma SICU for further care. The results of
his imaging revealed his chest tubes were in good position with
no pneumothoracices. His head CT revealed an old infarct but no
acute hemorrhage. The CT of his C-spine revealed a C3-C4 facet
distraction which was further investigated with an MRI study.
Neurosurgery was consulted and this injury was non-operatively
managed with a hard cervical collar that should be worn at all
times f
