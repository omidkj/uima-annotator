Chief Complaint:
Hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Craniotomy and evacuation of subdural hematoma


History of Present Illness:
76M H/O AAA Repair ([**2134-8-29**]), CAD/CABG ([**2131**]), HTN W/ frequent
urination, polyuria, dysuria, and DOE. The patient had a recent
[**Hospital1 18**] admission ([**Date range (1) 39772**]) for R Groin Hematoma and
Anemia. At that time, his Cr was 1.6 on admission (with a
baseline of 1.2-1.3) which was presumed secondary to his recent
contrast dye exposure for AAA Repair. His Cr has peaked at 1.9
and his [**Last Name (un) **] was held - he was then DCed with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**].
Patient then presented to [**Hospital6 33**] today with
several weeks of the frequent urination, polyuria, dysuria, and
DOE. All of the symptoms aforementioned began after his AAA
repair. His most disturbing symptom has been his frequent
urination - up to 12 times per night, causing him to lose much
sleep over the past couple weeks.

ROS: He's had no urgency, incontinence, hesitation, polyphagia,
CP, orthopnea, LE swelling, PND, fevers, pruritis, rash, abd
pain, diarrhea, or chills. He reports constipation, mild
fatigue, weight loss (indetermine amount, but clothes fitting
more loosely), anorexia and B/L hip, lower back, and anterior
thigh and leg pain that begins after 1-2 minutes of walking,
worsens with increased walking, and remits when he stops
walking.

At the OSH, his Cr was 6.3 and SBP 220. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED: T97.8 HR83 BP151/80 RR15 OS96%2L. STARTED ON NITRO
GTT.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2134-10-16**] 3:51 AM
Left hemispheric subdural hematoma with midline shift and
suggestion of uncal herniation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2134-10-25**] 3:00 PM
There is a large subdural hematoma along the left convexity,
primarily in the frontal region. It is unchanged in size since
the postoperative study performed at 12:39 p.m. on [**10-16**].
It is smaller in size compared to the preoperative study
performed at 3:40 a.m. on [**10-16**].
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage within the subdural
hematoma. However, there are new acute blood products in the
extracranial soft tissue hematoma overlying the left
frontoparietal craniotomy. Craniectomy defect. The ventricles
appear patent and symmetric, without hydrocephalus. The basal
cisterns are patent and symmetric. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.

Brief Hospital Course:
76M H/O AAA Repair ([**2134-8-29**]), CAD/CABG ([**2131**]) to [**Hospital1 18**] with HTN
and ARF of unknown etiology then to SICU after acute massive SDH
- now stable and neurologically intact S/P SDH evacuation, but
continued renal insufficiency - possibly secondary to
cholesterol emboli.
.
SICU course: Patient developed acute HA and then obtundation
early in his course. Acute Fronto-Parietal SDH w/ mass effect
discovered. Now S/P craniectomy and successful hematoma
evacutation. Started on phenytoin (then DCed) and steroid taper.
Pt improved neurologically (to near baseline) in the SICU, but
renal status has remained poor.
.
MICU course: After continuous hydration late in his course, in
the face of renal failure, developed acute pulmonary edema.
Aggressive diuresis commenced - with dramatic clinical
improvement. BP was still elevated, but stable for transfer to
medical floor.

FLOOR course:

* Acute renal failure: As above acute issues began to resolve,
patient's creatinine remained high (max to 6.8).  Patient had
access prepared for imminent dialysis, however, given brisk
diuresis near the end of [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, renal
consultants felt that dialysis could be deferred.  Indeed it was
felt that patient had post-ATN diuresis with possible full
recovery of function. [**Month (only) 116**] not require hemodialysis.  At the time
of discharge, patient's creatinine remained at ~5, however,
patient continued to have excellent urinary output.

* RASH: Late in hospital course, patient developed a pruritic,
erythematous papular rash on trunk which improved somewhat with
hydrocortisone cream.

* HTN: As noted above, blood pressure initially in urgency
range, however, was titrated to SBP130s-190s, generally 160s
with goal 140-160. Multiple regimen combinations attempted, and
ultimately stabilized to Labetalol HCl 800 mg PO TID, Isosorbide
Dinitrate 40 mg PO TID, Hydralazine HCl 50 mg PO Q8H.  Primary
care physician [**Name (NI) 653**] with notice to followup on regimen.

* SDH: Unchanged by CT from prior post-craniotomy film. Stable
