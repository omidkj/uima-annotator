As compared to the previous examination, there is a minimal
increase in density of the left perihilar lung areas. Otherwise,
the radiographic appearance is unchanged. The morphology and
sequence of change could suggest increasing overhydration.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 year old male who was admitted with abdominal pain
and found to have acute pancreatitis, etiology unclear.

Acute Pancreatitis: He was admitted to the SICU and had a
received aggessive fluid resuscitation. He was NPO with a NGT.
He was hypotensive and tachycardic. He received several fluid
boluses secondary to hypovolemia and low urine output. His
LFT's, Amylase, Lipase trended down. His abdominal pain
continued to lessen and distension improved. His diet was
advanced along slowly and he was tolerating a regular diet and
abdomen was soft.

Hypertension: He had some hypertension to the 170-180's. His
Lopressor dose was increased. Once tolerating a diet, his home
meds were restarted.

Fluid Overload: After several days of aggressive fluid
resuscitation, he required Lasix IV to offload some fluid. He
had mild CHF and bilateral vascular markings on CXR. He had an
appropriate response to the Lasix.

Hyperglycemia: He was started on an Insulin gtt for BS control.
We were able to wean his to SQ Insulin based on a sliding scale.
When he was tolerating a diet again, he was restarted on his
home meds.

Respiratory: He required a face tent for humidified O2 and was
receiving Nebs PRN. After good pulmonary hygeine, he was weaned
off the O2.

Neurology: He has a history of anoxic brain injury and myoclonic
jerks and was on his home Depakote. In terms of the seizures,
patient reports that he has seizures every 2 or 3 days, and his
last one was 3 days ago.  The seizures, per the patient, are
characterized by loss of conciousness. Per discussion with his
sister the patient has shaking periods where he loses
conciousness and has a postictal
period, lasting 30 mins.
In the ICU, he seemed quite somulent, disorietned and agitate.
Neurology was consulted for the possibility of drug induced
pancreatitis secondary to
depakote as no other causes of pancreatitis have been
identified. it seems
that Depakote as the etiology is a reasonable idea.  He does not
have any of the typical more common explanations such as
hypertriglyceridemia, alchololism or gallstones.  He has
multiple
reasons for his encepnahlopathy, most notably his significant
Co2
retention and narcotics.
He was started on Keppra for seizure coverage, as it is renally
excreted, fairly well tolerated and a firstline [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for
myoclonus.  As he is quite sedated and in danger of further
respiratory depression, we will give a somewhat muted loading
dose and maintenance
