[**2152-12-17**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Devascularized left kidney with only small amount of residual
perfusion.  No evidence of active arterial bleed. Stable size of
retroperitoneal hematoma. Visualization of only the proximal
portion of the left renal artery and left renal vein near its
confluence with the IVC raise the question of vascular pedicle
injury.
2. Splenic laceration as previously seen.
3. Liver laceration as previously seen.
4. Horizontal (Chance) fracture through the L1 vertebral body
with a small
hyperdense focus, possibly representing extradural hematoma. MRI
recommended for further evaluation.
5. Left-sided rib fractures.
6. Nonvisualization of the medial limb of the left adrenal
gland, may
indicate injury.

[**2152-12-17**] Head CT :
1. Stable small left intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. Question of additional foci of hemorrhage in the subarachnoid
space,
notably in the left frontal lobe. Prior administration of
intravenous
contrast, however, limits full evaluation.
3. Orogastric tube with single coil in the oropharynx.
Additional findings as on the final wet read- small left
parietal SAH/SDH?
contrast related enhancement and left tentorial subtle
hyperdense appearance-? SDH/ prior contrast related enhancement
and some degree of cerebral edema.

[**2152-12-18**] Head CT :
1. Stable small left intraventricular hemorrhage with possible
additional
foci of left parietal subarachnoid/subdural hemorrhage. No
evidence of new
hemorrhage.
2. No fracture identified.
3. Findings suggestive of acute on chronic sinusitis.

12/1210 MRI Lumbar spine :
1. Chance fracture involving the body and the right pedicle of
L1, as
described above, better seen on the prior CT study.
  2. Areas of increased signal intensity in the interspinous
region from
T11-L2, which may relate to edema/injury to the ligaments in
this location.  To correlate clinically. Recommend spine consult
to decide on further management.
3. Multilevel mild degenerative changes as described above
involving the
discs

[**2152-12-20**] CXR :
Bilateral airspace opacities mid to lower lobes, possibly
infectious

[**2152-12-23**] CT Torso :
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
2. Interval moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
atelectasis.  Cannot exclude superimposed infection.
3. Hypoperfused left kidney, asymmetrically small, with no
evidence of urine excretion at the portal venous phase,
compatible with the known traumatic injury. Small amount of
perinephric fluid/hematoma.
4. New small contrast collection in the spleen, could represent
repeated
acute hemorrhage, the adjacent rib fracture now shows some
displacement.
5. Unchanged liver and splenic lacerations as previously noted.
6. Unchanged L1 Chance fracture.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 916**] [**Known lastname 88468**] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the
Emergency Room and admitted to the Trauma ICU for further
management of her injuries as well as evaluation by the
neurosurgery service.  She underwent serial hematocrits and
neurologic exams.  As her hematocrit remained stable since her
transfusions in the Emergency Room, her sedatives were
discontinued for a good neurologic assessment and she was
eventually weaned and extubated from the respirator on [**2152-12-18**].

While in the ICU a small amount of drainage was noted from her
ear and confirmed to be CSF.  For a short time she was on
Nafcillin and Gentamycin however the leak sealed very quickly.
She was measured for a TLSO brace as she had an L 1 [**Last Name (un) 46542**]
fracture and until that arrived she remained on log roll
precautions. She had no neurologic deficits from her small SAH
with IVH and a repeat Head CT done 24 hours after admission
showed no increase in the size of the bleed.

Following transfer to the Trauma floor she was evaluated daily
by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy.  She was learning
to walk with the brace on but required much cueing and balance
training.  Her mini mental status exam showed some deficits with
memory, attention span and delayed recall.  She will need
continued OT as well as a referral to the Cognitive [**Hospital 878**]
Clinic.

She developed fevers during her hospitalization and was pan
cultures on 2 occasions.  The most revealing change was a chest
Xray on [**2152-12-20**] which showed bilateral lower lobe opacities,
possibly consistent with pneumonia.  She was then treated for
hospital acquired pneumonia along with pulmonary toilet and she
began to progress well. A PICC line was placed for IV antibiotic
therapy but she physically improved as did her chest xray and
she will complete her course on oral antibiotics.

After a long hospital stay she was discharged to home on
[**2152-12-25**] with VNA services.  She was ambulating independently
with her TLSO brace and tolerating a regular diet.  She will
follow up in [**2-9**] weeks in the Acute care Clinic.
