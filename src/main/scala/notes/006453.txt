History of Present Illness:
81 yo F w hx of bronchiectasis, dementia, presumed
microaspiration and recurrent aspiration pneumonias, presents
with 2 days of SOB, Cough from long-term care facility. She
denied fevers, CP, abd pain. A+O x 3. DNR/DNI in chart, but pt

Images:
[**2117-1-23**] CXR - hyperinflation, interstital promience
bilaterally, increased opacity of right lung base superimposed
on baseline emphysema
.
EKG: compared w/ [**2116-10-1**] NSR at 84, NI, P pulmonale, poor R wave
progression, no ST/T wave abnormalities from prior.
.
Speech and Swallow:
Pt demonstrates consistent deep penetration of both thin and
nectar thick liquids to the level of the vocal cords before the
height of the swallow.  While most of the material clears out, a
slight coating of barium material remains on the underside of
the
epiglottis, putting her at risk for aspiration after the
swallow.
.
Pt also demonstrated one episode of aspiration of thin liquids
during consecutive straw sips of thin liquid, likely due to the
volume of PO in her pharynx/laryngeal vestibule while trying to
coordinate the swallow.
.
Barium Swallow:
Abnormal primary peristaltic waves with clearance by secondary
peristalsis consistent with esophageal dysmotility disorder. No
anatomic
abnormalities identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo F with dementia, chronic bronchectasis from presumed
recurrent microaspiration presents with acute SOB and cough x2
days found to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure responsive
to BIPAP with clinical exam and CXR suggestive of right lower
lobe pneumonia.
.
# Aspiration Pneumonia: Patient presented with hypercarbic
respiratory failure, and video swallow sig for silent
aspiration.  In the ICU she required brief BiPAP and
subsequently remained stable on nasal canuli.  While in the ICU
patient experienced transient hypotension that resolved with
ivfs.  Given her peripheral eosinophilia, IgE, b-glucan, and
galactomanan were sent and were negative.  Urin legionella was
negative.  She was started on zosyn and vancomycin for a 9 day
course of HAP to end [**2117-2-3**].  Upon transfer to the floor,
patient was treated with abx, mucinex, nebulizers and chest PT.
She was slowly weaned down on her oxygen.  Upon discharge she
was sating low 90s on 1-2L nc.  Sputum cultures prelim grew gram
pos cocci, final cultures pending on discharge.  Speech and
swallow evaluated the patient and noted silent aspirations (see
below).
-- Continue iv antibiotics end date [**2117-2-3**]
-- Continue nebulizers and mucinex until pneumonia resolves
-- Continue 1-2L oxygen nasal cannula, wean as tolerated with
goal of O2 sat in low 90s.
.
# Oropharyngeal Dysphagia: On video swallow, patient was noted
to have mild OP dysphagia with aspiration during consecutive
sips of liquids.  A barium swallow was done that showed
esophageal dysmotility see below.  Patient was aware of
aspiration risk with feeding but declined enteral nutritional
support.
-- PO diet of regular solids and thin liquids
-- [**Hospital1 **] oral care
-- 1:1 supervision with meals to encourage pacing with small
bites and sips, as consecutive sips caused aspiration
.
# Esophageal Dymotility: Barium swallow significant for
esophageal dysmotility but no evidence of anatomic abnormalities
or reflux. GI was consulted who did not feel that the esophageal
dysmotility would increase risk of aspiration.  Patient is to
follow as an outpatient with GI for likely EGD and mannometry
for further work up.
.
# Dementia - continue home meds of namenda, aricept
.
# Osteoprosis - continue alendronate QWeek, [**Hospital1 **] calicum +D
.
# Eosinophila: AEC ~ 1300. Patient has had eosinophilia in the
past thought to be secondary to drug vs infection. On this
admission, b-glucan and galactomannan negative. IgE 86. A work
up for eosinophilia with stool cx for ova and parasites,
ANCA, Ig's, B12, lymphocyte phenotypes,
