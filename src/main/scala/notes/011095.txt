CC:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66916**]
HPI: Patient reports several month history of exertional
anterior
chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Patient denies
complaints of PND, orthopnea, N/V,diaphoresis or recent LE
edema.
He does report occasional lightheadedness and palpatations.
[**2-9**] Echo showed EF 65-70%, calcific mild to moderate aortic
stenosis, [**Location (un) 109**] 1.2 cm2, trace AI and 1+MR.
[**2167-5-11**] Patient was scheduled for an elective ETT-->exercised
3minutes and 43 seconds. Test discontinued due to fatigue, SOB
and trace chest pain. ECG notable for 3.0mm ST depression in
Lead
II, 2.0mm ST depression in V5-6, 1.5mm J point depression in
III,F and V4. Patient had resolution of symptoms at 6 minutes
and
ECG returned to baseline. Given the markedly positive findings
at
a low workload arrangements were made to transfer patient for
cardiac cath. He presented to the holding area in stable
condition, pain free.
Of note, patient has recently been undergoing an OPT work-up to
determine the etiology of his chronic anemia. [**3-9**] Upper GI

[**2167-5-11**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system.
There was a 50% distal LM stenosis involving the origin of the
LAD. The
LAD had a 95% stenosis originating from the LM plaque. There was
a 40%
ramus stenosis. The LCX was nonobstructed. The RCA had a 40-50%
mid
vessel stenosis.
2. Hemodynamics on entry showed mild aortic stenosis with a
gradient of
16 mm Hg across the aortic valve and a valve area of 1.1 cm2.
There was
LV diastolic dysfunction (LVEDP 19 mm Hg) and a normal cardiac
output
(4.5).

[**2167-5-13**] Panorex
Single Panorex view of the mandible shows only a few remaining
central lower teeth. It is difficult to assess whether small
caries are present in these teeth but no bone destruction and
the visualized lower maxillary sinuses are normally aerated. TM
joints not visualized.

[**2167-5-12**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
No appreciable plaque or wall thickening involving either
carotid system. The peak systolic velocities are normal
bilaterally as are the ICA to CCA ratios. There is normal
antegrade flow involving both vertebral arteries.

[**2167-5-15**] ECHO
Conclusions:
Suboptimal study. Only limited views obtained.
1.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

2.The prosthetic aortic valve is not well seen.
3.The mitral valve is not well seen.
4.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66917**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2167-5-11**] for further
evaluation of his exertional angina and positive exercise
tolerance test. He underwent a cardiac catheterization which
revealed severe aortic stenosis as well as left main and single
vessel coronary artery disease. Given the severity of his
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical
management. Mr. [**Known lastname 66917**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which revealed
normal internal carotid arteries. A dental consult was obtained
for oral clearance for surgery. After obtaining a panorex film,
Mr. [**Known lastname 66917**] was cleared for valve surgery from an oral
standpoint. On [**2167-5-13**], Mr. [**Known lastname 66917**] was taken to the operating
room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two
vessels and an aortic valve replacement utilizing a 21mm [**Doctor Last Name **]
Pericardial valve. Postoperatively, he was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative
day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 66917**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was
extubated. Aspirin, beta blockade and a statin were resumed. He
was then transferred to the cardiac nursing floor for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. On postoperative day two, Mr. [**Known lastname 66917**] developed torsades
de pointes requiring defibrillation and 1 gram of magnesium. He
was intubated and returned to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. The cardiology service was consulted for assistance
in his care. Amiodarone was loaded and he was extubated
successfully later on postoperative day two. He was transferred
to back to the floor on postoperative day five. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His amiodarone was switched
to an oral dose. He continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on postoperative day seven. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician
as an outpatient.
