.
CXR [**2178-3-27**]: Evaluation limited due to technical factors.
However, increased opacity at right apex may represent
pneumonia. Increased opacities at the lung bases may represent
atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be excluded. Marked
cardiomegaly is stable.
.
CXR [**2178-3-29**]: Compared to the study from the prior day there has
been some improvement in the aeration particularly in the upper
lobes but there continues to be cardiomegaly, vascular
re-distribution, and bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.
.
Microbiology: Blood cultures pending at discharge.
