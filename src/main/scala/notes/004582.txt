Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base / Protamine / Minoxidil

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVL placement in ED


History of Present Illness:
53 yo M with CAD s/p CABG and PCI (most recently [**8-/2139**]),
ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF=15%), DMI, extensive PVD s/p
multiple amputations, ESRD on HD presented to the ED after
awaking from sleep acutely SOB. Initially with WBC=18, BP=51/19
and HR=90s-130s. After 500cc of IVF, he began complaining of
shortness of breath and developed minimal crackles at the bases
along with an increasing oxygen requirement, ultimately
requiring NRB to maintain sats in the low 90s. Vanco/zosyn was
given in the ED and a central line was placed.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt interviewed with his wife present.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was SOB on NRB with O2 sat ranging 85-100% with variable
pleth.  He denied preceding fevers, chills, diaphoresis.  He had
noted a dry cough for some days leading up to this, but the
onset of SOB was sudden & severe; it awoke him from sleep. Per
his wife, his leg ulcers have been healing well. Pt has had
recurrent ESBL Klebiella UTIs which continue to be a problem.
[**Name (NI) **] also has an infected molar which was scheduled to be removed
this week and for which he has been taking penicillin.
.
He was weaned to 50% FIO2 on arrival with BP 60/34 (systolic
confirmed by doppler). CVP was 8 (pt does have 2+ TR and PA
HTN). Telemetry/EKGS notable for AFIB with rate ranging 90-[**Street Address(2) 17950**] depressions across the precordium. At that
time, pt complaining of lightheadedness and diffuse weakness;
denying chest pain.  He was given 500cc over 30min with good
response in his BP to 70s/40s. He stated that he felt less weak.
CVP~12 after the first 500cc given on the floor. After another
250cc, pt became acutely unresonsive & cyanotic for 30 seconds.
O2 sat failed to register initially and then returned at 60%
with poor pleth--no better on ears, fingers, forehead. He was
intubated by anethesia and good pleth obtained on the nose, sat
90s post-intubation.  A-line could not be placed for more
accurate monitoring during these events as his only palpable
artery is the femoral in his left stump & INR=3.
.
After intubation, pt's non-invasive BP=116/38 with HR~100 (afib)
and CVP 14-18.
.
ROS: Denied fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, hematuria.  Endorsed some mild bladder
discomfort, still produces minimal urine daily.

CXR
The endotracheal tube has been pulled back since the previous
study and now is 4.5 cm above the carina. The rest of the lines
and tubes are within normal limits. There are no pneumothoraces.
There is improved aeration at the left base since the previous
study. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. There is loculated
pleural fluid on the right side. The cardiac silhouette and
mediastinum is within normal limits.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo M presented with SOB hypotension, tachycardia (afib/rvr),
and leukocytosis. Although his baseline BPs are low, his initial
systolic of 50 was well below his baseline.  He received zosyn
and fluid in the ED. He received additional fluid on the floor
totaling 1L NS with good BP response. He subsequently became
hypoxic and unresponsive--it later became clear that peripheral
sats did not correlate with arterial blood gases (sat 50% when
pO2 120). Pt received meropenem given the sensitivity profile of
his ESBL KLEB. Also received a dose of vancomycin.

He was intubated follwing this hypoxic episode and amio loaded
over 30 minutes.  He transiently became bradycardic and
converted to sinus, his BP improved. Several minutes later, BP
drop acutely and pt lost pulse--monitor showing asystole.

CPR was initiated for asystole at 6am. ACLS algorithm was
followed. Afib with ventricular rate ~90 returned, and PEA
algorithm followed. In total pt received 5 doses of epinephrine,
calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate. Pulse and BP regained for 15
minutes. He then lost his pulse again and was shocked for a-fib
with RVR and returned in a wide-complex ventricular rhythm with
AV dissociation. After a subsequent shock, pt converted to a
narrow rhythm at 100bpm with complete av dissociation.
