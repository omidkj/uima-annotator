History of Present Illness:
(History mostly obtained from ED and patient nodding or shaking
head as CPAP mask makes talking difficult). This is a 76 year
old man with multiple medical problems including chronic
systolic CHF, interstitial lung disease, COPD (baseline 2L NC at
night), CKD, and PVD presenting with sudden onset of SOB 7am
this morning and bloody, frothy sputum. Patient reports feeling
well yesterday and rather acute development of this this AM. He
denies any fevers or chills prior to arriving in the ED. He
denies any other localizing symptoms of infection likey dysuria,
diarrhea, or abdominal pain. He [**First Name3 (LF) 653**] EMS for his dyspnea
and was put on 100% NRB oxygen and brought to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.4 (102 rectal), P 80, BP
165/71, RR 34, O2 96% on NRB. He was started on CPAP with
improvement in his O2 sats and in his work of breathing. Given
his relatively high blood pressures and concern of some element
of flash pulmonary edema, he was started on a NTG drip, but then
developed hypotension with SBP's in the 70's to 80's, which
failed to improve with discontinuation of the NTG. Therefore, he
was started on peripheral dopamine before having a femoral line
placed at which point he was transitioned to norepinephrine for
presumed pneumosepsis and hypotension (lactate was 3.8). CXR
showed bilateral multifocal infiltrates so he received
ceftriaxone/vancomycin/azithromycin empirically. Vitals prior to
transfer were P 68, BP 90/34 (up from 70's off pressors), RR 22,
100% on 5 of CPAP.

In the MICU, the patient reported feeling better and was able to
nod or shake his head to answer questions. Still using accessory
muscles to breathe. He was asking for CPAP to be removed.

Imaging:
CXR: [**5-19**]
A left-sided pacer demonstrates leads in the right atrium, right
ventricle and coronary sinus. The heart size is enlarged.
Mediastinal contours are somewhat obscured by bilateral fluffy
appearing opacities.  Calcified atherosclerotic disease is noted
in the aortic knob. Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen.
No pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema,
increased compared with prior study.

CXR: [**5-19**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
intubated. The tip of the tube projects 4.8 cm above the carina.
Nasogastric tube in situ, the tip of the tube projects over the
middle parts of the stomach. Unchanged course and position of
the pacemaker leads. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities show
minimal regression at the level of the bases of the lungs; in
the more apical lung regions, however, the severity of
the opacities is unchanged. Increasing retrocardiac atelectasis.
The presence of bilateral small pleural effusions cannot be
excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax.

CXR: [**5-22**]
Since prior examination, mild improvement in still severe
airspace opacity involving the right upper lobe, though with
worsening of severe opacity in the left retrocardiac region that
is likely component of effusion and/or atelectasis. Othwise
stable diffuse multifocal opacification. Stable moderate
bilateral pleural effusions. Stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity
of the thoracic aorta. Persistent mild pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
engorgement.
IMPRESSION: Grossly stable combination of multifocal pneumonia
and pulmonary edema. Increased severe left basal atelectasis.

CXR: [**5-31**]
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Left transvenous pacemaker
leads terminate
in the standard position in the right atrium, right ventricle
and through the coronary sinus. There is no evident
pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
Bilateral diffuse opacities that were a combination of pulmonary
edema and pneumonia have markedly improved. Still there are some
opacities in the perihilar regions, right apex, and right lower
lobe



Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old male with multiple medical problems including CHF,
COPD, and ILD with very poor respiratory reserve presenting with
hypoxemic respiratory failure with fever and hypotension.

1) Pulmonary (Hypoxic Respiratory Failure): Patient was
initially admitted to MICU where intubation was required from
[**2085-5-18**]. Multiple etiologies were considered to explain his
hypoxic respiratory failure. At baseline patient has
interstitial lung disease and COPD. Given fever, leukocytosis,
sputum, elevated lactate multifocal pneumonia was also
considered and ult
