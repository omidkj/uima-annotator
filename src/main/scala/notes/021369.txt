Chief Complaint:

Chief Complaint: Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardectomy [**12-24**]


History of Present Illness:
32 y.o. M with multiple episodes of pericarditis presenting with
CP.
.
The patient states that he awoke from sleep several times the
evening prior to admission with severe aching substernal chest
pain. At 6AM he awoke for good with 8/10 pain. He describes
associated shortness of breath and episodes of chills and
sweats. The patient took 2 percocet with improvement in the pain
to [**2111-5-18**] and then 2 more percocet with improvement in the pain
to [**3-24**]. The patient's pain resolved in the ED 12 hours after it
began. This is identical to the patient's prior episodes of
chest pain associated with pericarditis except today's episode
is not as severe. Of note, the patient was feeling well in the
days prior to admission and interviewed for a job at a health
club as a personal trainer 1 day prior to admission. The
interview consisted of a strenuous workout.
.
The patient had multiple episodes of pericarditis, last
11.02.07-11.06.07 at [**Hospital1 18**]. During that admission, the patient
presented with CP radiating to the back, diaphoresis, N/V and
abdominal pain with some hypotension. The patient had no echo
and cath signs suggestive of tamponade with small-moderate sized
effusion. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis on [**2108-12-15**].
He transiently had a pericardial drain in place. Extensive
work-up of for a source of pericarditis, including
rheumatologic, infectious and malignant is ongoing and thus far
negative (including pericardial fluid negative for AFB, viral
cultures or malignant cells). 1 out of 2 bottles of pericardial
fluid is growing presumptive peptostreptococcus from [**2108-12-15**].
The patient was scheduled for outpatient rheumatology follow-up
though this has not yet occured.
.
In the ED 98.7 92-98 120-138/60-70 18 97% RA. Pulsus <4 by
report. The patient received aspirin 325 mg and toradol 30mg IV.
He underwent bedside echocardiogram with verbal report of small
pericardial effusion, elevated RA pressure but no tamonade. The
patient had a CXR with a question of left lower lobe pneumonia
and he received levofloxacin 500mg IV.
.


Past Medical History:
Pericarditis x 4 , last time complicated by tamponade

Social History:
Social history is significant for occasional tobacco and
occasional marijuana use.  He admits to cocaine use in the past,
but not in the past 5 years.  He denies IVDU.  He occasionally
drinks ETOH.


Family History:
There is no family history of pericarditis. He has a first
cousin with a diagnosis of lupus, otherwise no other
rheumatological diseases.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
32 year old man s/p pericardectomy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for effusions
EXAMINATION: Chest x-ray.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 32-year-old man status post pericardiectomy,
evaluate for effusions.

FINDINGS: Two views of the chest were obtained and compared to
the prior examination dated [**2108-12-27**]. A tiny left apical
pneumothorax persists that has slightly decreased in size since
the prior examination. There is an interval decrease of the
right pleural effusion associated with improved aeration of the
right base. There is a minimal right basilar atelectasis
present. No new focal opacities are seen. Sternotomy wires are
intact and unchanged in position. The cardiac silhouette is
mildly enlarged, grossly unchanged since the prior examination.

RENAL U.S.

Reason: HYDO/STONES

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
32 year old man with increase creat x 4 days / no hiistory of
CRI
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
hydro / stones
INDICATION: 30-year-old man with increasing creatinine for four
days.

COMPARISON: CT of the torso, [**2108-12-13**].

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 12.8 cm. The left
kidney measures 13.2 cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis
or stones. Relatively echogenic region within the interpolar
left kidney appears to correspond to an area of normal cortex
seen on CT in association with a duplicated collecting system on
the left side.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
