Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66M [**Location (un) **] home resident with h/o
eosinophilic lung disease on chronic steroids/azathioprine,
COPD, recurrent aspiration s/p g tube placement, and PE s/p IVC
filter placement who initially presented [**2171-8-12**] in the setting
of a fall and respiratory distress. Per report, patient was
transferring from his motorized scooter to a chair and suffered
a mechanical fall, landing on his L side. At that time, he was
noted by staff to be hypoxic to 75% on RA (versus his baseline
of 93-94% on RA, with occasional use of 1-2L supplemental oxygen
following exertion), prompting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], where he was
admitted to the TSICU. CT head/neck/torso were unremarkable,
apart from a possible L seventh rib fracture. Chest CT was
concerning for a possible infection versus aspiration versus
acute-on-chronic pulmonary process, though patient denies any
apparentaspiration events, noting that he is strictly NPO, with
the exception of swish/suction of coffee and sublingual morphine
for pain control. He received vancomycin/cefepime/levofloxacin
x1 and Medrol x1 in the ED, but these were not continued in the
TSICU. He also was noted to have an elevated Tn to 0.49, without
change in EKG or CK-MB and subsequently downtrending Tn.

EKG ([**2171-8-12**]): Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2171-6-23**] no significant
change.

EKG ([**2171-8-13**]): Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing no significant change.

EKG ([**2171-8-14**]): Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block. Poor
R wave progression, likely a normal variant. Cannot exclude a
prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2171-8-13**] no diagnostic interim change.

Portable CXR ([**2171-8-12**]):  Bibasilar opacities are concerning for
an
infectious process superimposed on a background of chronic
scarring and
atelectasis.  Upper lung fields appear relatively clear.  There
is no
mediastinal widening.  The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.
Pulmonary
vascularity is normal.

Noncontrast head CT ([**2171-8-12**]): No evidence of acute intracranial
pathology.

Noncontrast spine CT ([**2171-8-12**]): No evidence of fracture or
dislocation.  Emphysema at the lung apices.

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast ([**2171-8-12**]):
1.  Acute on chronic process within the lungs with extensive
ground glass
opacities, particularly in the right middle and lower lobes,
suggesting an infectious process; inflammatory lung disease and
aspiration are other
possibilities which could be considered in the appropriate
setting.
2.  Stable hepatic and renal cysts.
3.  Stable gallbladder adenomyomatosis.
4.  Equivocal nondisplaced hairline fracture of the left seventh
rib (2:48) cannot be completely excluded.  Old rib deformities
bilaterally.  Compression deformities within T10-L2 vertebral
bodies.  Stable loss of vertebral height noted within mid
portion of L1 vertebral body and anterior wedging defect at T11
vertebral body, similar to the prior examination.






Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66M [**Location (un) **] home resident with h/o
eosinophilic lung disease on chronic prednisone/azathioprine,
recurrent aspiration, PE s/p IVC filter placement p/w fall and
respiratory distress c/w with an apiration event and splinting
in the setting of a rib fracture.
.
# Hypoxia: Given acuity of presentation, new hypoxia was felt to
represent possible aspiration/microaspiration event despite
presence of g tube. Pneumonia was felt to be less likely in the
absence of fever or leukocytosis while exacerbation of his
underlying pulmonary disease was felt to be similarly unlikely,
given acuity of presentation despite CT findings possibly
consistent with pneumonia versus acute-on-chronic lung disease.
Splinting due to pain likely also contributed to his
supplemental oxygen requirement, with pain relief from PCA and
subsequently morphine. He remained afebrile/HD stable without
leukocytosis throughout admission, and supplemental oxygen
requirement was weaned from 3L to his home requirement of 2L. He
continued to receive prednisone and azathioprine for his chronic
lung disease, with taper of prednisone to 7.5mg and azathioprine
to 100mg planned at discharge as per his outpatient
pulmonologist's intention.
.
#L-sided pain: Pain on palpation was consistent with
radiographic evidence of rib fracture and was controlled with
PCA and subsequently morphine sublingual. At the time of
discharge he was on his home pain regimen.
.
#Troponin elevation: Initial elevation to 0.49, with flat CK-MB,
subsequently downtrending troponins, and unchanged EKGs was felt
to represent strain and not acute coronary syndrome requiring
intervention.
.
# Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on his home
levothyroxine.
.
# Chronic Pain: Home fentanyl patch and gabapentin were
continued. Patient was given morphine as above.
.
# GERD: Home lansoprazole and metoclopramide were continued.
.
# HL: Home ASA and atorvastatin were continued.
 .
# Mental health: Home citalopram and quetiapine were continued.

.
# H/o multiple fractures: Patient was continued on his home
calcium and vitamin D. Patient likely would benefit from a DEXA
scan as an outpatient.
.
Transitional issues
- Patient will continue to follow up with his outpatient
pulmonologist for further titration of prednisone and
azathioprine.
- Given history of extensive steroid use and fractures, patient
likely would benefit from a DEXA scan and consideration of
bisphosphinate therapy.
