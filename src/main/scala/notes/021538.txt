Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Inguinal Lymph Node Biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 80 year old female who is presenting to us from
rehab ([**Hospital3 2558**]) with new melena.

She has a history of GAVE diagnosed in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year at
[**Hospital6 2561**] diagnosed on endoscopy after her
hematocrits were noted to be low near 27.  Her GAVE was
cauterized at this time by her gastroenterologist.

Her past medical history is also significant for coronary artery
disease with stents placed in [**2116**], congestive heart failure,
and stage III chronic kidney disease.

Ms [**Known lastname **] presents today after 2 episodes of melena at [**Hospital 7137**].  This morning she had crampy abdominal pain lasting
minutes throughout her abdomen with rectal urgency.  She passed
2 bowel movements and the pain subsided.  Her nurse noted the
stool to be black although Ms [**Known lastname **] states the stool is always
black because of her ferrous supplements.  Stool guiaiac was
positive; apparently in the past it has been negative.  No
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or hematemesis.  No fevers, chills,
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, chest pain, chest
pressure, or dizziness.

She was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-25**] for
an exacerbation of congestive heart failure, during which time a
pleural effusion was tapped; thoracentesis revealed a transudate
with negative cytology.  Her creatinine was elevated to 2.2.
Renal ultrasound revealed a left renal hilum mass measuring 10.3
x 4.6 x 4.9 cm as well as lesions in the liver and pancreas.  A
CT contrast to evaluate these further could not be performed
because of her acute kidney injury.  She was discharged with
instructions to follow up with her primary care doctor to
further evaluate these lesions.

Over the past two months, Ms [**Known lastname 110511**] appetite has waned.  Her
weight has dropped around 10 lbs.  She has not had any prior
episodes of melena or hematochezia.  No hematemesis history.
Denies abdominal pain.   Other than the two episodes today, she
feels well at time of transfer to MICU.

Social History:
She lives in [**Hospital1 **] with her younger sister.  She has
been back and forth between [**Hospital3 2558**] and [**Hospital3 60734**].  She used to work in a publishing house until age 75.

Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
On admission:
Vitals reveal a regular pulse 60-70.  Systolic ejection murmur
is heard best in aortic area.
Respiratory rate is 18 with no significant accessory muscle use.
 Oxygen saturation is 98% on 2 L of oxygen.
Her blood pressure reveals a wide pulse pressure with systolic
of 140 and diastolic of 30-40.
In general, she is Caucasian, a thin, pleasant, elderly woman,
appropriate to conversation, inquisitive, alert, and oriented to
person, place and time.
Cardiovascular exam shows no appreciable JVP, pulses 2+ and
equal bilaterally, with a systolic ejection murmur without
clicks loudest in aortic area.   Pulmonary exam reveals mild
crackles at bases bilaterally, free of wheezes, with respiratory
rate of 18.  Abdominal exam shows a distended, tympanic abdomen,
with no appreciable masses or tenderness.  Extremities are quite
swollen, with 3+ pitting edema to the thighs bilaterally.  No
cyanosis, warm fingers and toes.  Neurologically non-focal.

Studies:

CT Abd/Pelv - IMPRESSION: 1. Splenomegaly and extensive
lymphadenopathy involving the root of the mesentery,
retroperitoneum, pelvis, and inguinal areas most consistent with
lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease. 2. Evaluation for liver
and kidney mass is limited due to lack of IV contrast. 11-mm
hepatic hypodensity is a nonspecific finding. If prior imaging
from outside hospital is made available, a direct comparison can
be made. 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and left basilar
atelectasis. Consolidation cannot be excluded. 4. Low volume
ascites.

CXR - FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were
obtained. Relatively low lung volumes. The patient is status
post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement. There is
some obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, which may be due to
a left pleural effusion with atelectasis. No large right pleural
effusion is seen, although a small one would be difficult to
exclude. There is prominence of the central pulmonary
vasculature.

LENI - IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right or left lower extremity.
Right calf veins could not be seen.

[**2132-4-23**]
Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. A bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is higher
than expected for this type of prosthesis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 7mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric right and left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Well-seated aortic valve bioprosthesis with higher-than-expected
gradients. Mild functional mitral stenosis from annular
calcification. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


[**2132-4-23**] CT Chest
IMPRESSION:
1.  Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy as described above.
2.  Moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
3.  Left lower lobe ground glass opacities which could be
infectious or
atelectasis due to poor inspiratory effort.

Left inguinal node biopsy
Lymph node, left inguinal, biopsies (A-C):

Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (See note).

Note:  The lymph node sections show areas of effacement of
normal architecture by medium to large lymphoid cells, with
abundant cytoplasm, oval to round nuclei with irregular nuclear
membrane, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.  Admixed
are small mature lymphocytes.  There are focal areas of
nodularity seen.  The immunohistochemical
