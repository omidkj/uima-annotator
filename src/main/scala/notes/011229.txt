of laminectomy wound
-[**2197-12-3**]
1. Incision and drainage of back wound.

History of Present Illness:
68yo male with PMH significant for polio with residual RLE
paralysis and atrophy, DMII, HTN, [**Month/Year (2) 9215**], CAD with angina, and
recent T9-S1 laminectomy on [**10-18**] (with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] for severe
spinal stenosis. Post laminectomy, patient had hypoxemia and was
treated with nebs, antibiotics and with diuresis. He was
discharged to rehab without O2 requirement and on home dose of
PO Lasix 40.

Later seen at clinic and noted to have some serosanginous
drainage, but no erythema or sign of infection. He was given IV
ceftaz [**Hospital1 **]. He returned to [**Location **] on [**11-26**] septic - with fevers,
white count of 27, neck pain, and pus from operative site.
Intubated for MRI and airway protection. MRI showed no definite
focal collection in the soft tissues or epidural space, although
it was a poor study. Nonetheless, emergent I&D was performed
with 6 L washout of infected lumbar wound, wound cultures sent
which later grew out MRSA, no CSF taken as dura was intact, and
two lumbar drains placed and hemovac applied. BCx also drawn
which later grew out MRSA.

After I+D, he was admitted to TSICU. Briefly on a pressor (neo)
and had initial 4L O2 requirement after extubation. Antibiotics
switched to vanc/zosyn (starting on [**11-26**] and [**11-27**]
respectively) with improvement in WBC (27->20->12->normal on
transfer to floor today). Afebrile and subsequently narrowed
down to vancomycin per ID given culture of GPC in pairs and
clusters (likely MRSA) for a planned total course of antibiotics
of 8 weeks (from day 1 [**2197-11-26**]). PICC Line was placed on
[**2197-11-29**].

[**2197-11-28**], patient developed increased difficulty breathing
attributed to fluid overload. He was diuresed with two doses of
IV lasix 20mg and then switched to 40mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] for [**11-30**].
On this ICU stay he was net positive 700ccs. On transfer he is
saturating 97% on 3L NC.

On [**11-29**] prior to initial effort to transfer to [**Doctor Last Name **] A, had a
30 beat run of V-tach in context of K+ of 3.2. Asx. EKG at the
time showed JP elevations in V1-V3 with poor R wave progression.
Otherwise patient was in normal sinus rhythm with PACs.
Potassium was repleted. First troponin was negative.

Initially on Fentayl PCA for control of back pain and neck
stiffness. Has been weaned down to oxycodone/tylenol/neurontin
over ICU stay with good tolerance on transfer.

Past Medical History:
- Diastolic Heart Failure with preserved EF - recently started
on Lasix by his PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**10-16**] with LVH and preserved EF.
- Hypertension c/b LVH
- CAD c/b angina, unknown history of MI, caths
- Type 2 DM
- BPH
- Polio
- H/O measels, mumps, whooping cough
- Hemorrhoids
- Cervical laminectomy and fusion
- Ulnar nerve decompression

Social History:
He's from [**Hospital1 189**]. He has residual weakness on the right side
from Polio and has been unable to ambulate on the left secondary
to pain and spinal disease for which he was operated on this
admission. He is a 1ppd smoker since age 12. He drinks 6-8
drinks per week. He denies any IVDU. He drinks socially, denies
any drug use.

Family History:
Heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis.
