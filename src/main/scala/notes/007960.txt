Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
74 M with h/o dialated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD placement
presents with shortness of breath and nausea. Patient was
discharged yesterday from the CCU service after presenting in
the setting of a pacemaker firing for ventricular arrythmia,
volume overload, and presumed pneumonia that was treated with 5
days of Vancomycin and 7 days of levofloxacin.
Following discharge, he felt well. He was somewhat tired this
morning, but was seen by a VNA without issue. Later today, he
felt tired, wheezy, nauseus, and hot. The CCU NP called him for
routein follow-up and told him to come in based on his shortness
of breath.
In the ED, his initial vitals were T 98.8 HR 90 BP 125/77 RR 28
Sat 100/RA. Blood pressures dropped to 66/53 and he was given
1.5 L NS and started on levophed. Blood and urine cultures were
sent. A central line was placed with initial CVPs 20-27. He
received levofloxacin and clindamycin.
Currently, he feels "so-so". He complains mostly of sinus
congestion that has been going on for months. He is mildly short
of breath and tired. He denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, rashes, headache, visual changes.

[**11-21**]: Viral swab positive for HSV type 1

MRSA screen positive x 2

[**11-17**]: Blood cultures and Urine culture neg

CXR [**11-17**]: There is suggestion of increased opacity, possibly
infiltrate, in the left perihilar region, partially obscured by
the overlying pacemaker/AICD. If clinically feasible, consider
PA and lateral views for more sensitive evaluation.

CXR [**11-18**]: IMPRESSION: Increased opacities, left perihilar
region.

CXR [**11-24**]:
1. Unchanged marked cardiomegaly consistent with known history
of dilated
cardiomyopathy with prominent central pulmonary vasculature
suggesting
underlying pulmonary hypertension.
2. Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions. No
radiographic
findings to suggest concurrent interstitial pulmonary edema.
3. New right lower lobe opacity, likely atelectasis.

ECHO [**11-18**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15%). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction. Dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic
dysfunction. At least mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 M with dialated cardiomyopathy s/p ICD placement admitted for
hypovolemic hypotension.

HYPOTENSION - On initial presentation multiple etiologies were
considered including overdiuresis, overbeta-blockade, adrenal
insufficiency, worsened CHF, sepsis, PE, ischemia, cardiogenic
shock. CVL was placed in ED, started on pressors and given IVF.
Later turned out that BP likely taken in left arm where pt has
subclavian stenosis. Since arrival to the CCU, pt had adequate
BPs off pressors, on BP meds and required some diuresis. Lactate
was initially elevated but quickly resolved and there was no
other signs of infection (all cultures neg, no new findings on
CXR), therefore pt was not continued on antibiotics.

VENTRICULAR ARRYTHMIA: History of VT in the setting of volume
overload. Patient continued to have VT and ectopy. On previous
admission, pt started on Amiodarone and had increased LFTs
requiring discontinuation. He was discharged on increased dose
of beta blockade to decrease ectopy but while hospitalized had a
repeat episode of VT. EP service recommended continuing digoxin
and adding Mexiletine. Ablation was thought to be unlikely be
successful and thus medical management was determined to be the
first line of therapy.

CHRONIC SYSTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Pt remained, stable
euvolemic. Pt was continued on his PO lasix with goal of keeping
him negative. He was also kept on a strict fluid restriction,
both to correct the hyponatremia thought to be SIADH secondary
to lung disease, and to prevent positive fluid balance. An ECHO
was done and showed EF of 15%, at least mild MR, mod TR, mod
pulm HTN, ascending aorta mildly dilated, and b
