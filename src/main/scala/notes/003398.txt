Brief Hospital Course:
This is a brief hospital course organized by systems. Overall
patient had an uncomplicated laparoscopic/thoracoscopic
esophagogastrectomy and feeding jejunostomy that was complicated
by a pseudomonas pneumonia requiring prolonged intubation,
antibiotics and chest tubes; atrial fibrillation requiring
diltiazem drip; as well as persistent delirium. At the time of
discharge delirium, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation had
resolved. Patient spent 41 consecutive days in surgical
intensive care unit and 50 total days in the SICU.

1)GI:  Patient underwent laparoscopic/thoracoscopic
esophagogastrectomy and feeding jejunostomy on the day of
admission.  Procedure went well without complications. Patient
went to SICU for close monitoring following the procedure.
Flexible esophagoscopy on [**2115-10-15**] showed patent anastomosis
with no area of breakdown

2) Respiratory: Intubated following surgery. Initially unable to
extubate due to thick sputum and increased secretions. Then
extubation continued due to pseudomonas pneumonia. CT scan [**9-17**]
showed RLL and LL consolidation and bilateral pleural effusion.
A left chest tube was placed on [**2115-9-24**] for respiratory distress
and persistent left sided pleural effusion and removed on
[**2115-10-1**]. Attempt at extubation [**2115-10-1**] failed. Patient remained
intubated with endotracheal tube 21 days until [**2115-10-2**] at which
time a percutaneous tracheostomy was placed. Right chest tube
placed on [**2115-10-5**] for a pleural effusion.  Patient weaned from
ventilation and trach mask placed successfully on [**2115-10-13**]
(POD#31).

Patient readmitted to SICU on [**2115-10-30**] (POD#49) for respiratory
distress. Ventilation restarted and bronchoscopy was performed.
Chest CT demonstrated no acute change. Patient again weaned
quickly to trach collar and transferred back to floor [**2115-11-7**]
(POD#57).

Tracheostomy downsized to #6 on [**2115-11-14**] (POD#64) and
decannulated completely on [**2115-11-18**].

3) Psychiatric: Began getting agitated and receiving PRN Haldol
on [**2115-9-16**]. Subsequently increased to 4mg TID on [**2115-9-17**].
Haldol stopped and Seroquel started on [**2115-10-10**] (POD#29) for
continued agitation. Upon transfer to floor patient remained
very agitated, disoriented, and unable to sleep.  Psychiatry was
consulted on [**2115-10-28**](POD#47) and formally diagnosed patient with
delirium and recommended checking TSH, B12, folate, and head CT.
All of these tests were unremarkable except for TSH which showed
patient to be hypothyroid. Sensorium began to clear on the night
of [**2115-11-14**] (POD#64) with patient no longer requiring a sitter
and increasing orientation.  Psychiatric evaluation on [**2115-11-18**]
(POD#68) confirmed that patient had a delirium, multifactorial
etiology, that had resolved. They recommended continued 150 mg
[**Date Range **] Seroquel with possible wean starting next week.

4) Fluids/Electrolytes/Nutrition: Trophic tube feeds with Impact
begun on [**2115-9-13**] via J-tube.  Feeds advanced without difficulty
to 3/4 strength impact with fiber at a rate of 100ccs/hour.
Bedside swallowing evaluations on [**2115-10-24**] demonstrated
aspiration of thin and thick liquids and video swallow test also
showed patient to be at risk for aspiration. Subsequent
oropharyngeal videofluoroscopy swallowing evaluation on [**2115-11-8**]
confirmed these findings.

5) Urogenital: Foley pulled out by patient on POD#62 ([**2115-11-12**])
and remained out until discharge.  Patient is occasionally
incontinent of urine, but this incontinence was improving at the
time of discharge.

6) Cardiac: Developed atrial fibrillation in the early
post-operative period which was treated with diltiazem gtt and
Lopressor. Cardiology was consulted. Diltiazem drip was able to
provide good rate control. Patient developed prolonged QT most
likely secondary to Haldol and had at least one run of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Coumadin restated on
[**2115-10-10**]. Diltiazem continuous infusion stopped on [**2115-10-9**]
(POD#29) and digoxin added on [**2115-10-11**] (POD#30).

Patient had episode of lateral wall ischemia and RBBB on
[**2115-11-2**] POD#52 with small rise in troponin. Cardiology,
however, believed that patient suffered only mild
heart damage.  Echocardiogram demonstrated ejection fraction of
greater than 55%.

7) ID: Initially on cefazolin and Flagyl as post-operative
prophylaxis. Changed to Zosyn on [**2115-9-14**] for pseudomonas
positive sputum cultures on [**9-13**] and [**9-14**] with gentamycin
added on [**2115-9-18**].  Sputum cultures continued to grow
pseudomonas on [**2115-9-23**] and bronchoalveolar lavage culture from
[**2115-9-26**] also grew pseudomonas. Vancomycin added on [**2115-9-17**] for
high WBC count and concern about a wound cellulitis and
discontinued on [**2115-9-30**]. Flagyl was started on [**9-21**] empirically
for possible C. difficile colitis and was subsequently stopped
on [**2115-9-24**] following three negative C. difficile stool toxin
tests. Gentamycin was discontinued on ID's recommendation on
[**2115-10-13**] (POD#32) and Zosyn was discontinued on [**2115-10-21**]
(POD#40) after 38 days following negative gram stain of pleural
fluid.

Vancomycin and meropenem were restarted on [**2115-10-30**] (POD#50)
empirically for respiratory distress. Vancomycin discontinued
after seven days and Meropenem after 8 days.

8) Tubes/Lines/Drains: Patient had multiple central lines,
arterial lines, PICC lines, chest tubes, and JP drains. At the
time of discharge all tubes, lines and drains were removed
excepted the J-tube. The PICC line was discontinued immediately
prior to discharge.

9) Ophthalmology: Consulted o
