Imaging:
CXR ([**2142-4-14**]) - Opacification in the infrahilar left lung
suggests that it is still once again collapsed. Small left
pleural effusion is minimal, if any. New right infrahilar
atelectasis is moderate to severe. Upper lungs clear. The heart
is not enlarged. No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube can be traced
as far as the lower esophagus but the tip is not distinct. On a
subsequent radiograph, 9:13 a.m. on [**4-15**], it ends in the
stomach.

CT A/P ([**2142-4-15**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Edema and peripancreatic stranding consistent with
pancreatitis. Focal
area of hypoenhancement involving the pancreatic neck and
portions of the body and head, which are most consistent with
early pancreatic necrosis.
2. Edema within the duodenal wall
