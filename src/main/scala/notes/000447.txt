Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Amoxicillin / Wellbutrin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
paracentesis, thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
58F w/Alcoholic cirrhosis with consequent diuretic-refractory
ascites, edema, hyponatremia, and pleural effusions presents
from the IR outpatient clinic for admission because of fever to
101.7. Pt has known alcoholic liver disease with ascites
worsening over the past 6 months. She is being worked up for
liver [**First Name3 (LF) **] here. Over the past week she has been
increasingly fatigued walking across a room. Needs to sleep
nearly-upright with multiple pillows because of breathing
difficulty when lying down. Having daily fevers at nighttime. No
chills, no nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain. Some non-productive
cough. No sick contacts or contact with children. No dysuria or
hematuria. No bloody stools, but does always have black stools,
which she attributes to occasional lactulose use. When asked
about weight changes she states she hasn't been able to
recognize her body for 6 months.
.
This morning she presented to previously-scheduled outpatient
session with IR for therapeutic thoracentesis and paracentesis
to offload her ascites and pleural effusions, all thought to be
secondary to decompensated cirrhosis. First such session was
last week; at her last taps 1.75L of pleural fluid was removed
from her chest, she did not require post-procedure albumin, and
was able to go home the same day. Plan was not to be drained so
soon thereafter, but increase in dyspnea this week prompted a
return visit in just 1 week. At IR VS were 101.7 107/56 108
82%/3L. Because of the fever, she had just a diagnostic
paracentesis, but she did have 1L straw-colored drained by
thoracentesis due to O2 desaturation. O2 sat resolved to 90%/RA
by the end of the procedure, and post-procedure CXR show some
interval improvement of her R hydrothorax. Pleural and
peritoneal fluid sent for analysis and culture, blood cultures
also sent. Admitted for IV albumin, antibiotics for possible RUL
PNA seen on CXR, and fluid optimization.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 F w/decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis and worsening ascites
and R-sided pleural effusions initially admitted to the Liver
service with fever for therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 576**] and paracentesis. On
[**2140-7-25**], she developed hypoxia post thoracentesis requiring NRB
and was transferred to the MICU. Hypoxia was felt to be
re-expansion pulmonary edema, potentially complicated by
pneumonia given her fevers, worsening shortness of breath and
hypoxia. In the MICU, she initially required 100% face mask. IP
placed a pigtail catheter to drain re-accumulated right pleural
effusion [**2140-7-26**]. Initially, 600cc of serosanguinous fluid was
drained. The next day, 2L were drained. She was able to be
weaned to 3L NC and went back to the medical floor for
management of hyponatremia and worsening renal function.
Creatinine increased from baseline of 1.0. It was felt that she
was developing hepatorenal syndrome.

On [**8-9**], a liver donor became available and patient accepted
offer. She underwent ABO (A) incompatible liver (she was blood
type O) with splenectomy on [**2140-8-9**]. Three JPs were placed.
Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Pheresis was done just prior
to [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for Anti A titer of 512. CVVHD was done intraop.
Postop, she was transferred to the SICU intubated for
management. She required blood products in the immediate postop
period, but remained hemodynamically stable. LFTs increased
initially as expected then trended down daily. Liver duplex on
postop day 1 was normal. JP outputs were non-bilious. The JP in
the splenic bed had the highest output and appeared bloody.

Plasmapheresis continued daily based on Anti A antibody titers.
Titers decreased to 4. A total of 13 treatments were done. ATG
was given daily for a total of 7 doses (75mg each). Platelets
were administered prior to ATG in the immediate postop period.
Immunosuppression consisted of steroid taper per protocol,
CellCept [**Hospital1 **], ATG and Prograf which was started on postop day 1.
Doses were adjusted per trough levels. Goal prograf level was
10.

CVVHD was continued for hepatorenal syndrome. CVVHD was switched
to HD via temporary HD line. Nephrology followed her throughout
the hospital stay. Urine output increased around postop day 7
and dialysis was stopped ([**8-19**]). Urine output was approximately 2
liters, however, creatinine and BUN continued to increase up to
105. Dialysis was resumed on [**8-24**], and continued daily on [**8-25**] and
[**8-26**]. This was repeated on [**8-29**]. The plan was for her to continue
on hemodialysis at least twice weekly on Mondays and Fridays. On
[**8-25**], the temporary dialysis line was exchanged for a tunnelled
HD line in interventional radiology. A right-sided 23-cm
tip-to-cuff hemodialysis line with tip was seen in the right
atrium, ready for use.

She was transferred out of the SICU on [**8-20**] to the medical
surgical floor where diet was advanced and tolerated, but intake
was insufficient. Therefore, a feeding tube was placed and tube
feeds were started. Nutren 2.0 at 40cc/hour continuous was
recommended by the dietician. This was well tolerated. She
required intermittent sliding scale insulin for hyperglycemia
due to steroids.

Medial and lateral JPs were removed. The splenic bed JP drain
output appe
