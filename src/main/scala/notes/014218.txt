HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
female who presented with a chief complaint of shortness of
breath and dyspnea on exertion.  She has a history of this
for 5 years and also has COPD.  She has had no recent angina
previous to this admission, however, the shortness of breath
and dyspnea was increasing.  The patient had a positive
stress test and a cardiac catheterization positive for
coronary artery disease.  She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**]
for CABG.  Cardiac cath from [**1-4**] showed 100% occlusion of
the mid LAD, 90% of the left circumflex.  Data from [**2182-12-5**] showed EF of 20% or so, left ventricular hypertrophy
with mild to moderate MR and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
right coronary was also deceased.

PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes for
7 years, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hepatitis C for
which she is on Inferon for one year, rheumatic fever,
glaucoma, COPD, emphysema, status post cholecystectomy and
dilatation and curettage.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Zestril, Lasix, Imdur, potassium,
Lipitor, Digoxin, Amiodarone, Toprol, Insulin, Serevent,
Atrovent, Albuterol and Timolol at home.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine which results in hives and itching.
Penicillin results in dyspnea and burning.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for mom having severe coronary
disease as well as her father.  She used to be a medical
assistant and she lives with her husband.  She has a 60 pack
year history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission were blood
pressure 116/64, heart rate 76, she weight 228 lbs and was
markedly obese.  She had no JVD, no bruits, had regular rate
and rhythm.  Breath sounds were decreased with wheezing
bilaterally.  Her abdomen was significant only for scars from
previous surgery and was obese and nontender, non distended.
She had no acute varicosities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2183-2-27**] and is
scheduled for discharge tomorrow on [**2183-3-12**] under Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] of cardiothoracic surgery.  She underwent a CABG
times four on [**2183-2-27**] on the same day of admission which she
tolerated well.  The patient remained intubated on the first
day post-op and BP, was on Dobutamine and pressors.  There
were episodes of what appeared to be ventricular tachycardia
stable with normal sinus rhythm in the ICU.  EPS was
involved.  She was started on Amiodarone.  Pulmonary consult
was also involved postoperatively in the SICU.  They agreed
with us feeding the pressors and the increasing lactate in
the labs possibly showing that the acidosis she had had
immediately postoperatively was resolving.  The patient was
extubated on [**3-1**] without complication and remained in the
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient did fine in the Intensive
Care Unit.  After that was slowly weaned and was clinically
stable and improving.  On [**3-3**] she was taking a diet and was
transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy was involved with
her care and felt that she would benefit from some degree of
rehab.  On the floor the patient was doing well and the wires
were discontinued and Foley was discontinued on [**3-4**].  Some
discharge was noted from the patient's inferior aspect of her
sternal wound during her floor stay.  The patient's sputum
and respiratory status were also monitored during the course
of her stay.  She was started on Levaquin and Vancomycin for
her sternal drainage and sputum.  The patient, for the rest
of the stay, remained with poor pulmonary status which was
preexisting with her COPD.  Sputum culture sent off twice
during her admission showed 4+ gram negative rods, however,
nothing grew out on culture except normal oropharyngeal
flora.  Wound culture was negative as was the gram smear from
thoracic drainage times two.  Vancomycin was discontinued and
patient started on Levaquin and Flagyl.

At discharge the patient's thoracic drainage was much
decreased and sternal wound looks non cellulitic, non
infected and stable.  White count was 21 on the 5th and
pending being decreased by [**3-12**] when she will be discharged.
The patient was discharged home on one week of Levaquin and
Flagyl.  The patient is expected to be discharged home on
Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid, potassium 20 mg po bid, Colace 100
mg po bid, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Aspirin 325 mg po q d,
Serevent MDI 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **], Levofloxacin 500 mg po q d,
Combivent multidose inhaler 2 puffs q 6 hours prn, Lasix 80
mg po tid, Timoptic .25% q h.s. once a day to each eye,
Lipitor 10 mg po qid, Amiodarone 400 mg po q d, Dilaudid 2 mg
po q 4 hours prn for pain and Ativan 1 mg po q 12 hours prn
and she is expected to use her insulin for better than 12
which [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted about.  As well as Flagyl 500 mg
po tid times 7 days in addition to the Levaquin.

Upon discharge her physical exam reveals a much reduced
sternal drainage, somewhat lung exam is difficult due to her
body habitus, however, sounds like a few rales scattered.
Abdomen is soft and nontender.  Heart is regular rhythm and
she has no JVD or hemodynamic instability.  An addendum will
be dictated tomorrow.
