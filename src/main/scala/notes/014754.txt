History of Present Illness:
OUTPT CARDIOLOGIST: [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 80965**]
.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 80966**] is an 80yo M with dementia, CAD s/p CABG in [**2105**]
(LIMA-LAD, SVG to OM2, SVG to RPDA), then s/p CABG redo in [**2111**],
then s/p 2 caths this year with patent LIMA, totally occluded
SVG to RPDA, SVG to OM2, s/p BMS to LCX on [**1-28**] who
presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with increasing chest pain
and nausea over the past few days.
.
Per report, patient has presented several times since last
cathed for recurrent angina. Admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2121-4-5**]
with recurrent chest pain. Ruled out for MI. Last episode of
chest pressure was the morning of transfer, associated with dry
heaves and belching relieved with morphine. Pt was continued on
ASA, Plavix, Statin, BBker, Imdur and placed on Heparin gtt.
.
Cath last [**Month (only) 958**] here at [**Hospital1 18**] showed a patent BMS in LCX and no
new lesions. The plan in conjunction with referring Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from [**Hospital3 417**] was to optimize medical therapy in
house. If the angina were to continue, the plan was to consider
opening RCA CTO as
well as PCI of a OM2 beyond prior stent. Pt was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for pre-hydration in anticipation of the above procedure.
.
On the floor, pt is agitated, and unwilling to answer questions
about his symptoms. He is threatening to [**Doctor Last Name **] doctors, demanding
to leave the hospital. He states, "my daughters should be
yelling at you to leave me alone." He is adamantly refusing
cath.

Radiology Results:
[**2121-4-7**] at OSH
mild prominence of the markings at the right base. The
appearance is of uncertain significance. Post surgical changes
are noted.
.
EKG: Sinus at 77, old inferior infarct. <1mm ST depression in I
and aVL which were previously noted.
.
[**2121-4-6**] OSH ECHO: EF 55%-60%, septal wall hypertrophy. Basal
anterior wall scarring/HK, mild MR, mild AR, mild PR. dilated
LA.
.
[**2121-3-11**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic

dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
The lumen of the descending thoracic aorta appears echodense in
parasternal long-axis views compatible with probable severe
atherosclerotic plaque.  EF 45%
.
Cardiac Cath [**2121-3-10**]:
1. Access via 4 F sheath in RFA.  We took pictures of the native
left in AP caudal, lao caudal and lao cranial.  No other vessels
were engaged in order to save contrast.  These views showed the
stent to be widely patent with no new lesions.
2. Hemodynamics with BP 132/70 with HR in sinus at 74 on IV tng.

3. The plan in conjunction with referring Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from
[**Hospital3 417**] is medical therapy in house.  If he continues to
have angina could have the RCA CTO opened as well as PCI of a
OM2 beyond prior stent.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2121-1-28**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated native three vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA had no obstruction. The LAD was totally occluded at its
mid-portion, with serial focal 80% stensoses proximally; these
stenoses may impair flow to the septals which do supply flow to
the distal RCA. The LCx had a 80% proximal stenosis and a long
tubular 70% lesion in the proximal OM1 which is then occluded
more distally, supplies collaterals to the RCA. The RCA is
totally occluded in its mid-portion, with left to right and
right to left collaterals.
2. Selective angiography of the bypass conduits demonstrated
total occlusion of the SVG-RPDA and SVG-OM2. The LIMA-LAD was
widely
patent.
3. Successful placement of a 2.0x12mm Mini Vision
bare-metal stent was performed in the proximal LCx.  Final
angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no
residual stenosis.  (See PTCA comments.)
4. The right femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed using a
Mynx device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Totally occluded SVG-RPDA and SVG-OM2.
3. Patent LIMA-LAD.
4. Successful BMS placement in the LCx.
.
[**2121-4-13**]
1- Selecive coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
showed
severe diffuse three vessel disease. The LMCA had mild plaquing.
The LAD
was diffusely diseased with serial 80% lesions throughout its
course and
total occlusion at the mid vessel. The KLAD gave collaterals to
the RCA
via its septal branches. The LCX was diffusely diseased with a
long 80%
lesion that starts proximal to the stent and continues as ISRS.
The LCX
gave rise to a major branching OM with long 90% stenosis at the
origin
of the upper pole of the OM. The LCX gave numerous collaterals
to the
distal RCA system. The RCA was chronically occluded proximally
with
essentially no contguous flow channel. Tghe vessel was difusely
diseased
throughout.
2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment showed moderately
elevated
(171/60 mmHg).
3- Successful POBA of the origin/proximal upper pole of a
branching OM2.
Final angiography showed a nonflow-limiting (TIMI III) stable
dissection
at the angioplasty site with 30-40% residual stenosis and no
distal
emboli.
4- Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with a
2.5x18 mm
Cypher DES. Final angiography showed no residual stenosis with
TIMI III
flow and no dissection or distal emboli. Rigorous flow into the
LCX-->RCA collaterals was noted.
5- Successful revascularization of a totally occluded RCA with
POBA of
the entire RCA proper (ostium to bifurcation). Final angiography
showed
30-40% residual stenosis with stable nonflow-limiting (TIMI III)

dissection (proximal third) and no distal emboli.
6- Successful deployment of a Perclose Proglide closure device
to the
RCFA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Modearts systemic hypertension.
3. Successful POBA of the distal OM.
4. Successful PTCA and stening of the proximal LCX with a Cypher
DES.
5. Successful POBA of the entire RCA proper with
re-establishment of
TIMI III flow to chronically-occluded vessel.
6- Successful deployment of a Perclose Proglide closure device
to th
