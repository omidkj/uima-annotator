History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 2026**] is a 65 year old male with history of
Tracheobronchomalacia and GERD who underwent laparoscopic Nissen
[**2121-3-6**] as a preamble to definitive correction of his
tracheobronchomalacia with his primary symptom being severe
dyspnea. The patient is here today for preoperative evaluation
for his tracheoplasty scheduled tomorrow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He
denies nausea, vomiting, or heartburn, except occassional
heartburn with regurgitation if he eats too fast (once a week).
He did have a short silicone y-stent trial which he was noted to
have improvement of central airway symptoms, but this came out
early due to cough in [**2120-11-14**].

Pertinent Results:
imaging:
CXR [**2121-7-23**]
Pneumomediastinum. Marked right sided subq emphysema. Right
chest tub tip
right lower hemithorax. No definite ptx but diffucult to eval
[**3-18**] subq
emphysema.

CXR [**2121-7-24**]
There are lower lung volumes, this accentuates the cardiac
silhouette which is of top normal size. There is mild
mediastinal widening. It could be projectional but attention
should be paid in followup studies. Left lower lobe atelectasis
has worsened. Right upper lobe opacity is new, could be due to
atelectasis or aspiration. Right chest tube remains in place.
Extensive right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema has minimally
improved. There are no enlarging pleural effusions or evident
pneumothorax.

CXR [**2121-7-25**]
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion in the right hemithorax,
pleural tube in place traversing the apex of the right lung and
descending below the level of the carina. Severe subcutaneous
emphysema in the right chest wall and neck is stable. Focal
opacity right mid lung is probably fissural pleural fluid, but
focal lung lesion including infection or infarction is not
excluded. Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. Small left
pleural effusion has increased. Heart size normal.

CXR [**2121-7-26**]
There has been no significant change since the prior chest x-ray
of [**7-25**]. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is still present.
No definite pneumonic consolidations are present, though these
are difficult to exclude. Loculated effusion on the right side
is again noted.

CXR [**2121-7-27**]
The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD. A right-sided
chest tube is present. No pneumothorax or gross effusion is
identified. There is
relatively extensive subcutaneous emphysema overlying the right
lung and chest wall. There may be subtle background interstitial
markings in the right infrahilar region. There is some increased
retrocardiac density, unchanged, with minimal blunting of the
left costophrenic angle also unchanged. Slight fusiform fullness
of the trachea at the region of the thoracic inlet,is also
unchanged, with opacity over the area at the level of the
clavicular heads.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Surgical Service for
the electively shceduled tracheoplasty for
tracheobronchomalacia. Patient tolerated the operation well. He
was extubated in the operating room and was transferred from the
operating room to the intensive care unit for overnight
observation. He had epidural for pain, was NPO, on IVF, with
foley catheter in place. The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received epidural for pain control. That was
replaced and split shortly after the operation. Patient had an
epidural with bupivicaine and PCA dilaudid. His pain was very
well controlled. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. He was treated
with lopressor IV as needed.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization. Patient had a chest tube
in place that was initially to suction and had a minimal leak.
It was placed to a water seal on POD 1 and had no leak since. It
remained in place until POD 4 when it was discontinued. There
were no complications following the removal of the chest tube.
Patient did not have a pneumothorax. He was weaned of oxygen and
by the time of discharge his oxygen saturation was > 92% on room
air when ambulating.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced slowely from sips to clears to soft
solid food on POD 3. On POD 4 he was advanced to regular diet
which he tolerated very well. Patient did not experience any GI
complications. Patient's intake and output were closely
monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when
necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. Patient remained
afebrile throughout his hospital stay. His white blood cell
count was within normal limits. He recieved perioperative
antibiotics only.

Endocrine: No issues. Patient was on his home dose of
levothyroxine.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
