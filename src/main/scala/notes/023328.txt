altered mental status

History of Present Illness:
76 year-old woman with a past medical history of seizure
disorder who presented yesterday evening as a transfer from [**Hospital1 **] after presenting there earlier in the week for
unresponsiveness.

She presented to [**Hospital6 1597**] on [**2115-2-22**] after two days of
increasing lethargy and decreased level of responsiveness.  Work
up in the ED revealed a subtherapeutic Dilantin level so
Dilantin was bolused.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial
process.  Lumbar puncture was performed and showed no white
cells, no red cells but an elevated total protein of 135.  There
was a troponin enzyme elevation noted on admission.

By report, she was initially  managed in the [**Hospital3 **] step
down unit and after several days had some improvement in her
mental status.  CXR showed a possible LLL infiltrate and she was
briefly treated with antibiotics.  By some accounts, she was
even walking, talking, and eating ice cream.  Keppra was started
on the evening prior to transfer.  On the morning of transfer,
she was noted to be less responsive.  EEG was performed as was
read as consistent with a moderately severe encephalopathy.

On arrival to floor, noted to be poorly responsive,
hypoventilated, with multifocal myoclonus.  Labs from ABG showed
elevated C02 and hyponatremia.  Transferred to the ICU after
arrival to the neurology floor for higher level nursing care.

Managed on CPAP overnight with little improvement in gas
exchange or level of alertness. The patient was intubated
shortly thereafter.

Of note, other records from [**Hospital3 **] report an admission
earlier this year, in [**12-25**], for a similar presentation.  LP was
performed at that time with lack of significant pleocytosis and
an elevated protein to 125.


Past Medical History:
Seizure disorder- uncertain etiology per discussion with pt's
son, has been on dilantin for many years without seizures,
seizures returned/worsened in [**2104**] in setting of shingles (per
son). She does not see a neurologist despite PCP's
recomendation.
Polio as a child- residual R lower motor neuron CN VII palsy
(unable to fully close R eye)
Parkinson's disease- refused sinemet for years.
Hypercholesterolemia


Social History:
lives at home with her son, no distant smoking history. no
illicits.


Family History:
No family history of neurologic disease.

Gen- critically ill, responsive only to noxious stimulation.
HEENT: bony ridge on left parietal skull surface, dry MM,
Neck: no carotid bruits
CV: RRR, no MRG
Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS+
Extrem: thin, pale, generalized muscle wasting, no CCE.

Neurologic Exam:
MS- unresponsive. does not open eyes to noxious. withdraws legs
to noxious.

CN- eyes conjugate, intact VOR, Left pupil 4-->3mm, right pupil
3-->2mm, left corneal intact, right corneal absent. left facial
assymmetry.

Motor- generalized muscle wasting, occasional assymmetric low
amplitude rhythmic proximal movements. withdraws lower
extremities in the plane of the bed to nailbed pressure. No
movement or wince to noxious in upper extremities.

Toes upgoing bilaterally.

Sensory- withdraws to pain bilat lower extrem.

Reflexes- 2+ in patella, 1+ ankle, 1+ bicep, tricep, BR.
symmetric.

EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
Ventilator dependent. Follows simple midline and appendicular
commands. Right CN VII palsy (chronic post polio)- unable to
close R eyelid. Upper extremities barely [**2-20**] (antigravity) +
motor impersistence. Withdraws lower extremities to noxious
stimulation in the plane of the bed. Intact deep tendon reflexes
throughout.

Imaging:
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-2-27**] 12:14 PM
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH IV CONTRAST: No edema, masses, mass
effect, hemorrhage, infarction or diffusion-weighted abnormality
is detected. The ventricles and sulci are normal in course and
configuration. Small vessel ischemic changes are noted in the
periventricular white matter.

MRA OF THE BRAIN: The carotid and vertebral arteries are normal
in their intracranial course. No stenosis or thrombosis are
noted.

Impression: Unremarkable MRI and MRA of the brain with no acute
intracranial pathology.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
small. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

EMG/Nerve Conduction Studies:
Abnormal study. A mild critical illness neuromyopathy cannot be
entirely
excluded based on the data obtained. There is no clear evidence
for a
demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (as in Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome), a
disorder of neuromuscular transmission (based on the technically
limited
repetitive nerve stimulation and SFEMG), or a generalized
disease of motor
neurons or their axons.

GRAYSCALE AND DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY:
[**2115-3-12**] 1:29 PM
Normal flow, compressibility, and waveforms are seen in right
internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and cephalic
veins. There is partially occlusive clot in the right basilic
vein above and below the elbow. There is soft tissue swelling
along the cephalic and basilic veins.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT. Partially occlusive clot of the
right basilic vein.

EEG- continous bedside video EEG for three days-
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Routine
sampling and automated detections showed an encephalopathic
background
throughout. There were no epileptiform features or
electrographic
seizures. Encephaopathy suggests cause by medications, metabolic

disturbances, or infection.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-3-9**] 4:20 AM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the
nasogastric tube and the endotracheal tubes have been removed. A
tracheostomy tube has been newly inserted; the position of the
tube is standard. Unchanged central venous access line, right.
Unchanged aspect of the slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis with subtle left-sided
pleural effusion. The very subtle right-sided basal opacities
are also unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77922**] is a 76 year old woman with seizure disorder,
untreated early stage Parkinson's who was transferred to this
hospital with diminshed responsiveness. Extensive prior
evaluation notable for elevated CSF protein, LLL retrocardiac
opacity, peripheral leucocytosis. EEG performed prior to
transfer suggestive of encephalopathy. The patient arrived on
the neurology floor in a minimally responsive state. ABG
revealed hypercarbia and the patient was transferred to the
Neurology ICU. Subsequent hospital course is detailed by problem
as follows:


1) Neurologic-
At presentation the patient was minimally responsive with absent
right corneal reflex and R CN VII palsy which is likely related
to her history of polio. She had
