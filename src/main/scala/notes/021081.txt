History of Present Illness:
32 y/o gentleman with a h/o MVP since childhood now with 4+ MR
admitted for repair versus replacement. He was in his usual
state of good health until approximately 1 week ago when he
began to notice palpitations and chest pain. He presented to
[**Hospital3 3583**] where he was in atrial fibrillation with mild
congestive heart failure. A catheterization was performed which
showed mild coronary artery disease and 4+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 72424**] was 60%.
He was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical
evaluation.

[**2175-3-6**] - ECHO
PRE-CPB: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the body of the  right atrium. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
([**Month/Day/Year 72424**]>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe
mitral valve prolapse of the anterior leaflet.. There is partial
mitral
leaflet flail of the A2 leaflet. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric and directed
posteriorly.. The mitral annulus is enlarged and measured 3.9.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
POST-CPB: On phenylephrine drip. Well-seated mechanical valve in
the mitral position. Trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] jets. 3-D
reconstruction shows good valve excursion. MS gradient of 5 mmhg
at Cardiac Output of 5.5 L/min. There is preserved biventricular
systolic function. The aortic contour is normal
post-decannulation.

[**2175-3-5**] CXR
Scoliosis and deformity of the thoracic cage. No acute
cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 36803**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2175-3-5**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. He was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner and deemed suitable for surgery. On
[**2175-3-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname 36803**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent a mitral valve replacement with a 25/33 On-x valve, a
MAZE procedure and left atrial appendage ligation.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. By postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 36803**] had awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Coumadin was started
for his mechanical valve. Given his preoperative history of
atrial fibrillation and current tachycardia, amiodarone was
started. Later on postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 36803**] was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. Chest tubes and pacing
wires removed without incident.

Mr. [**Known lastname 36803**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
home on postoperative day #9. He will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1290**], his cardiologis at and his new primary care physician
as an outpatient. His coumadin dosing will be followed by
Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] until he sees his new PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 72425**] [**3-22**]. Target INR
is 2.5-3.5. First blood draw is scheduled for [**3-16**].
