IMAGING:
CXRAY ([**2187-8-31**]):
IMPRESSION: Right basilar opacity may be crowding of vessels
with atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be excluded. Repeat films
with improved inspiration could be performed for further
evaluation.
CXRAY ([**2187-9-2**]):
Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. No evidence of
pulmonary edema or
pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Relatively well-inflated
lungs with no
evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with no evidence of
vertebral compression fracture.
.
MICROBIOLOGY:
UCx ([**2187-8-31**] + [**2187-9-2**]) negative
Fecal CX ([**2187-8-31**]) negative for salmonella, shigella and
campylobacter
BCx ([**2187-8-30**] + [**2187-9-2**]) NGTD
.
PATHOLOGY:
Biopsy from flex sig ([**2187-9-3**]): pending

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
52 yo with long stand hx of crohn's s/p total colectomy and
splenectomy who presents with hypotension and Acute on chronic
renal failure, thought to be [**3-7**] to hypovolemia from diarrhea.
GI was consulted and flex sig was done, which showed changes c/w
crohns flare. Patient was started on mesalamine suppository and
enema.
.
# Hypotension: likely due to hypovolemia, possible infection
although not convinced pt has pna. Elevated WBC which can also
happen on crohns flare. He denies having fever, and has
non-productive cough which he states is chronic and relates to
smoking. BP responded with IV fluids. Pt appeared to be very
dehydrated initially and was resuscitated with 7+ L of NS over
the course of hospitalization. BP normalized w
