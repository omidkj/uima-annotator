History of Present Illness:
83 y/o F with hx of bronchiectasis and asthma (with multiple
recent admissions) presents today with worsening SOB, starting
this past Friday. She had felt short of breath, especially with
walking, but even at rest. Nothing she could do could make it
better. She was taking up to 5 nebulizer treatments in the

bothersome symptom right now.

84% on room air. She had a CXR that showed bibaliar opacities
with differential being atelectasis vs. infection (per the
radiology read). She received ceftriaxone 1 gm x1, azithromycin
500 mg x1, solumderol 125 mg x1 and several combivent nebulizer
treatments. She remained tachypneic but only required nasal
canula for oxygen supplementation. She did spike a fever to
101.2 rectally in the ED. She was on 2L NC (her home oxygen
level) upon transfer from the ED.
.
On arrival to the floor, she is feeling well. She is still
tachypneic to the 30s, although does not feel that she is
breathing faster than normal. She is speaking quickly and in
full sentences. She appears comfortable. She is coughing
intermittently. She is complaining of hand and shoulder pain.
Per daughter-in-law's report, patient took 15 mg prednisone,
diltiazem, 1 tab Ca supplement, and her nebs x2 this morning.
.
ROS was notable for only that mentioned in the HPI, otherwise
negative.

ECG on admission: Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Delayed
R wave progression. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing of [**2195-3-18**] the rate is faster.

CXR on admission:  Redemonstration of hyperexpansion and
interstitial changes compatible with chronic lung disease.
Equivocal new nodular opacities at the bases, though may be
better evaluated by PA and lateral chest radiographs if there is
concern for infectious etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 y/o Spanish-speaking only F with hx of bronchiectasis,
asthma, mutliple admissions recently for SOB who presents again
with 5 days of worsening SOB and is admitted to MICU for
monitoring.

# Dyspnea: patient has known bronchiectasis and asthma, on home
O2, with multiple admissions recently for pneumonias (with
pan-sensitive pseudomonas and influenza).  Patient was
tachypneic and febrile in ED concerning for infection, and since
CXR unrevealing, she was started on Ceftriaxone and
Ciprofloxacin in the ICU.  Sputum culture was sent, however past
sputum cultures have grown Pseudamonas (pan-[**Last Name (un) 36**]) and E.Coli
(resistent to Cipro), which is why these antibiotics were
originally chosen.  Pt was given Albuterol and Ipratropium
nebulizers, and supported with O2 to maintain O2 sat >92%.  She
was also started on 60 mg Prednisone with plan for a long taper
(not to decrease below 5mg per rheumatology notes).  After
leaving the ICU, patient was switched from Ceftriaxone and
Ciprofloxacin to Zosyn and Ciprofloxacin given by IV.  Patient
steadily improved with each subsequent day and was discharged
home with a PICC line to receive Cefepime IV for twelve
additional days per discussion with her pulmonologist.  Sputum
cultures are still pending, but have identified gram negative
rods and gram positive cocci (update: shows pseudomonas,
sensitive to cefepime).  Patient was set up for follow-up
appointments with her PCP and pulmonologist and is to have a VNA
visit her to help with antibiotic administration and chest
physical therapy.

# Fevers/leukocytosis: pt has a chronic leukocytosis from her
steroids, but was slightly higher than baseline on admission.
As such, she was begun on antibiotics.  Blood culture and sputum
culture were ordered.  Pt's WBC count trended down throughout
hospital course but was still mildly elevated at discharge.
Patient remained afebrile during remaining hospital course.

# Tachycardia: Pt has baseline tachycardia, and also received
nebulizers in ED and in ICU.  This finding may be due to use of
beta agonists and may also be related to chronic pain in hands,
shoulders from chondrocalcinosis.  Pt received a fluid bolus in
ICU for other reasons, but tachycardia did not improve.  She was
monitored on telemetry, and pain was controlled with scheduled
tramadol and PRN tylenol.  ECG was checked on admission and
revealed sinus tachycardia.

# Chondrocalcinosis: patient has known chondrocalcinosis of her
MCPs, PIPs and wrist, which is stable symptom wise while on low
dose steroids.   Pain control was accomplished with scheduled
tramadol and PRN tylenol.

# Hypertension: patient was mildly hypertensive to 130s-140s
during most of her admission.  She is on diltiazem at home,
though it is unclear why patient is on this regimen.  She was
continued on her Diltiazem, and BP was trended.

# Chronic
