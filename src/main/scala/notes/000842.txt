Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old F PMH Asthma, TBM who presents with shortness of
breath and cough.

Shortness of breath and cough: Probable COPD exacerbation in
setting of viral or environmental trigger. CXR without
infiltrate. The patient was initially admitted to the ICU where
she was started on Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV q 6hours and
nebulizer treatement. She had improvement back to her recent
baseline which is with persistent severe SOB with minimal
activity. She will complete a very slow taper of prednisone
eventually back to her chronic home dose for lupus of 10mg every
other day. She will complete 5 total days of azithromycin and
have ongoing nebulizer therapy. She will go to rehab for ongoing
physical therapy. She was started on bactrim prophylaxis dosing
because of the ongoing steroid use.

The patient has a very poor prognosis. She requires ongoing
counselling as an outpatient regarding code status and
expectations going forward. She will follow-up with her PCP and
pulmonologist.

All other medical issues were stable and she was continued on
her home medicatin regimen.
