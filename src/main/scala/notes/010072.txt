Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
COPD flare in setting critical aortic stenosis w/planned
valvuloplasty or valve replacement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
valvuloplasty [**2132-10-31**]

History of Present Illness:
77y/o w/ severe aortic stenosis, chronic CHF, COPD, and CAD,
awaiting AVR +/- CABG by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], also with HTN, DM2, COPD and
paroxysmal afib presents from OSH (Lakes Regional) with SOB/COPD
flare on IV solumedrol with poor glucose control requiring
insulin drip. He was admitted to [**Location (un) 11248**] [**Hospital3 **]
on [**2132-10-23**] for increasing shortness of breath and wheezing. He
was started on IV methylprednisolone, given nebulizer
treatments, and started on piperacillin-tazobactam. Patient was
seen by Pulmonary team at OSH. In the setting of IV steroids,
patient developed high blood sugars with a anion gap of 12 and
was started on an insulin drip, discharged with a rate of 9u/hr.
In discussion with patient's PCP and family, decision was made
to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management
pre-operatively. On morning of transfer, patient had complained
of mild burning sternal chest pain at outside hospital.
.
Patient was initially scheduled for aortic valve replacement on
[**2132-10-22**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], but it was postponed in the setting of COPD
exacerbation and recurrent herpes genitalis.
.
On review of systems, he endorsed orthopnea on presentation to
outside hospital. He does have prior history of PE and
ischemic/embolic colitis.
.
Upon arrival to the floor he was tachycardic rates 120s and
normotensive, oxygenation 100% 3L NC. States his cough and
congestion began [**2132-10-22**] when he swallowed a cheerio down his
wind pipe. Since then he has been having productive cough with
yellow sputum and SOB. He denies exertional or current CP, SOB,
abd pain, change in stools, no bloody stools, no dysuria or
trouble urinating, no headache. + cough with yellow sputum, no
fever/chills, wife with cold at home, + orthopnea, no PND, mild
LE edema.
.
He had some mild sternal burning chest pain without radiation
yesterday and briefly again today. ECG today shows ST
depressions in lateral and inferior leads unchanged from outside
hospital. Pain not reproducible and did not vary with
inspiration. Pain resolved spontaneously within 1-2 minutes.

Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Inferior

Right bundle-branch block. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the
previous
tracing of [**2132-10-22**] atrial fibrillation is new with rapid
response. ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent. Clinical

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2132-10-22**].
There is unchanged cardiomegaly. There are no signs for overt
pulmonary
edema, focal consolidations, or pleural effusions. No
pneumothoraces are
identified.

Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mild
