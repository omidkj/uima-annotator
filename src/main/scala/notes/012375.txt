TRANSFER TO [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 5656**] [**Known lastname 805**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] is a
992 gram product of a 27-5/7 week gestation pregnancy born to
a 43-year-old, gravida 3, para 0, 1 now woman. Prenatal
screens are blood type 0 negative, antibody positive for anti-
D antibody, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B
surface antigen negative, and group B strep status unknown.
This was an in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization pregnancy, and it was
uncomplicated until 1 week prior to delivery when the mother
experienced spontaneous rupture of membranes. She was treated
with ampicillin and erythromycin for multiple doses prior to
pregnancy. She was also treated with betamethasone and was
completed at the time of delivery. The infant was born via
vaginal delivery. Apgars were 8 at one minute and 9 at five
minutes. He required blow-by oxygen in the delivery room, and
he was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for
treatment of prematurity. His anthropometric measurements at
the time of birth were weight 992 grams (25th-50th
percentile), length 36.5 cm (50th percentile), head
circumference 24 cm (25th percentile).

an active, alert infant on a ventilator. He has a 3.5 ET tube in
place orally. Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat: His anterior
fontanels are open and flat. Sutures are closed. He has
symmetric facial features. His nasal airways are intact
without breakdown. His palate is intact. Chest: Breath sounds
are equal, well-aerated, slightly coarse. He has mild
intercostal and subcostal retractions. Cardiovascular: He has
a grade 2-3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. He has a normal S1 and S2. Pulses are +2. His abdomen
is soft, nontender, nondistended and no masses. He has active
bowel sounds. His cord has healed. GU: He has normal male

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:
1. RESPIRATORY: This infant was placed on continuous
    positive airway pressure upon admission to the neonatal
    intensive care unit. He remained on nasal prong CPAP on
    room air for the first 4 days of life. He then
    transitioned to room air, but soon thereafter required
    nasal cannula and then reinitiation of continuous
    positive airway pressure. He experienced nasal breakdown
    to the prongs and was trialed on a cannula, but had
    worsening respiratory distress and was intubated for the
    first time on day of life #18 and placed on conventional
    ventilator. At that time, he also had a chest x-ray and
    a tracheal aspirate suggestive of Methicillin resistant
    Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumonia. He was
    treated with a 14-day course of antibiotics at that time
    and continued to have an unstable course from a
    respiratory standpoint, often requiring upwards of 80-
    90% fraction inspired oxygen. He started on a course of
    inhaled steroids on [**2180-8-9**], but showed no
    improvement and was changed to systemic steroids on
    [**2180-8-17**] and received an 11-day course. He was
    able to mix small amounts of weans from the respirator
    but continued to be very labile and requiring high
    pressures and PEEPS to maintain adequate ventilation and
    oxygenation. On day of life #71, he started on a longer
    term of prednisolone, initially at 2 mg/kg once daily
    for 5 days. and then dropping to 1 mg/kg daily for 5
    days, and then he is currently on 1 mg/kg every other
    day. He has also been treated with Lasix, aldactone and
    spironolactone diuretics.

A Pulmonary consult was obtained with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**]
suggesting treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and
consideration a work-up for primary ciliary dyskinesia. On
[**2180-9-18**], this infant was able to be extubated from
the ventilator and was placed on continuous positive airway
pressure by way of prongs at 68 cm with oxygen requirement 55-
70% oxygen. On day of life  91, [**9-27**], infant
transitioned off to high flow nasal cannula. On day of life
101, patient developed hypercapnia with CO2s in the 100s.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**] was consulted and infant had a trial of Diamox
therapy. On day of life 5 infant reintubated due to
hypercapnia. The infant remains orally intubated with current
settings of 28/6, a rate of 30, pressure support of 10, with
FIO2 between 26 and 30%. He has a stable CBG of 7.32, 66, 48,
36 and 4. As part of the evaluation for severity of his
chronic lung disease and infectious disease tendency, this
infant had immunoglobulins which were sent which were within
normal limits. He also had surfactant protein analysis
pending at the time of this dictation. His HIV testing was
negative. The plan is to transfer this infant to [**Hospital3 18242**], [**Location (un) 86**], under the care of RL service for a direct
bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, nasal biopsy and a gastrostomy
tube.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR: This infant initially had no murmur.
    With the onset of severe respiratory distress with
    pneumonia, an echocardiogram was obtained on [**2180-7-18**] that showed a structurally normal heart and no
    patent ductus arteriosus. With the persistence of his
    severe chronic lung disease and concern for pulmonary
    hypertension, echocardiograms were reviewed on [**8-8**], [**2179**], [**2180-9-4**], and his most recent one on
    [**2180-9-25**]. He has had no pulmonary hypertension,
    but on the most recent echocardiogram he has
    supravalvular pulmonary stenosis. He maintains normal
    heart rates and blood pressure. His baseline heart rates
    are 120s-160 with a blood pressure of 94/48 with mean of
    62.

1. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  This infant
    initially received intravenous fluid by way of a double-
    lumen umbilical venous catheter. Enteral feeds were
    started on day of life 3 and gradually advanced to full
    volumes. His current formula is Enfamil 24 cal with
    additional Bene protein supplements. The recommendation
    of the Pulmonary consult. He is being treated for reflux
    with Prilosec and Reglan. His electrolytes have been
    checked frequently and have remained relatively stable.
    The most recent were checked on [**2180-10-26**] with
    sodium of 134, potassium 6.7 which was hemolyzed, his
    chloride was 104 and a total carbon dioxide of 22. His
    weight on day of transfer is  .

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Due to prolonged rupture of
    membranes at the time of delivery, the baby was
    evaluated for sepsis. Upon admission to the neonatal
    intensive care unit, complete blood count was notable
    for a white blood cell count of 42,300 with a normal
    differential. The elevated white blood cell count was
    felt to be due to prolonged rupture of membranes. Blood
    cultures obtained prior to starting intravenous
    ampicillin and gentamicin. The blood culture was no
    growth. She received a total 7 days of antibiotics. A
    lumbar puncture was performed and results are within
    normal limits. As previously noted, on day of life #18
    this infant required intubation for deteriorating
    respiratory status and had a tracheal aspirate showing
    Klebsiella and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
    aureus. He was treated with a 14-day course of
    vancomycin, gentamicin and ceftazidime. He also had two
    subsequent episodes of evaluation of sepsis due to
    clinical deterioration. Both blood cultures were no
    growth, and again on [**2180-8-24**] with
    deterioration of his respiratory status, a trache
    aspirate was sent and gram-negative rods were onc
