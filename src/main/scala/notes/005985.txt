[**2183-6-17**] Chest X-ray: There is some improved aeration at the
left base, though continued evidence of volume loss and pleural
effusion. Small right pleural effusion is seen. Continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular
congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
.
[**2183-6-13**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is possibly more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
partial anterior mitral leaflet flail. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
There is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the
mitral position. Ther is trace valvular MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8097**]c function is normal. The remaining study is unchanged
from prebypass.
.
[**2183-6-12**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography revealed no angiographically apparent
coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCX, and RCA were without
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided
filling
presssures with mean RA pressure of 11 mmHg. There was [**Month/Day/Year 1192**]
pulmonary hypertension, with mean PA pressure of 44 mmHg.  The
left-sided filling pressures were increased with mean PCW
pressure of 26
mmHg, with large 'v' waves indicative of severe mitral
regurgitation.
The cardiac index was normal at  2.5 L/min/m2.  There was mild
systemic
hypertension, with SBP of 157 mmHg.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52491**] was admitted [**6-12**] and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation which included cardiac catheterization which revealed
normal coronary arteries. The remainder of her preoperative
workup was unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery. The
following day, she underwent mitral valve replacement. For
surgical details, please see operative note. After surgery, she
was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.She awoke and
was extubated that evening. transferred to the floor on POD #1
to begin increasing her activity level. Chest tubes and pacing
wires removed per protocol. Gently diuresed toward her preop
weight. Developed A Fib and coumadin was started. Target INR
2.0-2.5. Continued to make good progress and was cleared for
discharge to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehab on POD #5. All f/u appts were
advised.Expected length of stay is less than 30 days.
