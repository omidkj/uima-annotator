HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 41-year-old obese woman with
asthma who had never previously been intubated prior to
admission but with poor compliance with medications and poor
follow-up, who called 911 with progressive shortness of
breath at home in the setting of upper respiratory infection
x 2-3 days.  En route to the Emergency Room, the patient
received 2 nebulizers of albuterol.  In the Emergency Room,
the patient was noted to be afebrile, heart rate was 106,
systolic blood pressure 172, saturating 98 percent on room
air.  The patient was given Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV as well as
Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers in the Emergency Room, as
well as Combivent.  Her saturations initially improved to 100
percent on room air.  The patient's respiratory status
progressively got worse with desaturations of 84 percent on
room air, also with increasing agitation, increasing
respiratory rate, and attempted to stand and was agitated.
The patient was, therefore, emergently intubated in the
Emergency Room for inability to ventilate effectively and
hypoxia.  The patient had oxygen saturations in the 40
percent range for about 1 minute due to prolonged intubation.
The patient was then brought to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for further management.  In the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, the patient was continued on ventilator and intubated
until [**5-1**] when she was extubated successfully.  The patient
was then transferred to the Medicine Floor on [**5-2**] in stable
condition.

5. Theophylline 300 mg 2 times a day.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Works in retail store.  Lives in [**Location 686**].
Denies alcohol, drug or tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit:  General, intubated, sedated, and
diaphoretic.  Vital signs, temperature 98.2 degrees,
axillary, blood pressure 164/85, heart rate 126, and 100
percent saturation on the ventilator.  HEENT, pupils were
equally round and reactive to light, anicteric.  Endotracheal
tube in place.  Neck, no jugular venous distention or
lymphadenopathy, supple.  Heart, tachycardic with no murmurs
appreciated.  Lungs, diffuse wheezing, poor air movement, and
no dullness to percussion.  Abdomen, obese, normal active
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No
hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.  Extremities with trace edema
bilaterally.  No clubbing or cyanosis.  Neurological,
sedated, spontaneously moving all extremities.

DIAGNOSTICS ON ADMISSION:  BUN and creatinine 14/1.0.  ABG,
pH 7.23, pCO2 68, pO2 131 on a nebulizer before intubation
and then at intubation 7.02/115/426.  White blood count 10.5,
hematocrit 39, and platelets 321.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  Chest x-ray with no pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was managed in the Intensive
Care Unit upon admission until [**5-2**].  The patient was
extubated on [**5-1**].

Pulmonary.  Respiratory failure/asthma.  The patient with an
acute severe asthma attack requiring intubation in the
Emergency Room.  The patient was eventually weaned from the
ventilator effectively and extubated on [**5-1**].  The patient
was maintained on Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Room as well
as in the Medical Intensive Care Unit as well as nebulizers
around the clock.  Upon arrival to the Medicine Floor, the
patient had been started on prednisone taper, which was
continued throughout her stay as well as at the time of
discharge.  The patient was also maintained on albuterol and
Combivent, which were switched over from nebulizers to
metered-dose inhalers.  The patient's respiratory status
remained very stable and on the Medicine Floor, she saturated
in the high 90s to 100 percent on room air.  This included
excellent oxygen saturations with ambulation.

Acid base.  The patient was in severe respiratory acidosis
upon admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  This
improved markedly with ventilator management, and her
arterial blood gas measurements came to within normal limits.

Mental status upon extubation as well as 1 day on the
Medicine Floor, the patient seemed quite slow to answer
questions.  This was thought to be related to the patient's
sedation while on the ventilator.  However, there was a
question of anoxic brain injury.  The patient's mental status
continued to improve on the Medicine Floor.  The patient's
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3403**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**] came to see the
patient and reported that the patient's mental status was at
her baseline.  This includes somewhat odd affect.  The
patient remained neurologically intact without signs and
symptoms of any CNS process.  Thyroid stimulating hormone,
RPR, and vitamin B12 were checked as reversible causes of
dementia, and these were all within normal limits.  The
patient's mental status continued to improve throughout her
hospital stay and was at baseline at the time of discharge.
However, with concern over possible anoxic brain injury, an
MRI/MRA was ordered for the patient as an outpatient and
scheduled for [**5-11**].

Ophthalmology.  The patient complained of blurry vision in
the left eye, also with bilateral conjunctival
injections/hemorrhages.  Ophthalmology was consulted and
found the patient's ophthalmological exam to be within normal
limits with no evidence of acute process.  They believe that
the conjunctival injections were related to traumatic
intubation and Intensive Care Unit course.

Anemia, microcytic.  The patient's iron studies were close to
within normal limits, plan outpatient follow-up, the
patient's hematocrit remained stable.

Prophylaxis.  The patient maintained on a proton pump
inhibitor in Intensive Care Unit and then switched to an H2
blocker for GI prophylaxis on the Medicine Floor.  The
patient maintained on subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis as well as the bowel regimen.

The patient is full code.
