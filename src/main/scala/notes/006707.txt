.

hypertensive to 226/120 without symptoms of headache, dizziness
or nausea. Given 5mg lopressor IV and 10 mg hydralazine IV. At
10:50 am. pt experienced increasing tachypnea, nausea, HR up to
100s then down to 50-60s. O2 sats ok on 2L NC, but also

Family History:
F: DM, CAD, HTN; No Cancer in family.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 99.8 BP: 173/109 P: 73 RR: 18 O2: 100%
GEN: NAD, Sitting up in bed
HEENT: NC, AT, right eye red.
CV: RRR, harsh III/VI systolic murmur
RESP: soft crackles, right base
ABD: soft, palpable gas, epigastric tenderness, hypoactive BS
EXT, mild peripheral edema, DP's 2+


Pertinent Results:
CXR -
Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuous aorta is stable. S-shaped
scoliosis and associated degenerative changes also unchanged.
Surgical clips
noted within the thyroid bed. Linear radiodensity within the
left
retrocardiac region is most consistent with atelectasis. Right
lower chest
pleural based densities may represent pleural based mass.
Recommend repeat
study with AP and lateral radiographs.
.
RUQ US -
.
CT Head -
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. There is
increase in
periventricular hypodensity with notable extension into the
right centrum
semiovale, most consistent with chronic small vessel ischemia.
2. Mucosal thickening within the sphenoid sinus which is
improved since
previous study.
.
EKG - unchanged from baseline
.
PA/lateral CXR ([**1-27**]). The right PICC line distal tip projects
at the expected location of the mid
SVC.  The surgical clips of the  lower neck are most likely
related to the prior surgery at this area. The moderately
enlarged heart is unchanged.  Small right pleural effusion is
unchanged.  No focal infiltrate is noted to suggest pneumonia.
No pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  The S-shaped
scoliosis of the thoracic spine is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 74yo F with a h/o HTN, Lupus, DM and RA who presents
with acute epigastric abdominal pain found to be hypertensive to
the 220s with questionable compliance home antihypertensive
regimen.
.
1. Hypertensive urgency/emergency: ruled out for MI, no evidence
CVA or aortic dissection by imaging. Likely [**3-8**] non-compliance
with home anti-hypertensive regimen and chronic kidney disease.
No RAS by MRI.  Patient ran out of diltiazem and unclear if
using clonodine patch.  Admitted to ICU and then to floor on
[**1-20**] with improved control.  Diltiazem xr split into twice
daily dose.  Clonidine patch continued.  Losartan re-added on
[**1-22**] after resolution of ARF-see below (had been on
candesartan--not on formulary).  Additionally, imdur added.
Nitropaste for sbp>170.   By [**1-24**] bp ranging 130-160's on
clonidine patch, losartan 50, diltiazem 180XR [**Hospital1 **], imdur 60.
Medications were further adjusted, and on discharge her blood
pressure was 137/74 with a heart rate of 65, on a regimen of two
clonidine TTS-3 patches, losartan, nifedipine, metoprolol
succinate, and furosemide. Goal STANDING blood pressure is
<130/80 and >110/55.
.
2. Acute Renal failure/chronic kidney disease stage III:
Baseline creatinine 1.3 to 1.6.  On admit 1.6, but then on [**1-20**]
up to 2.2  Possibly secondary to BP changes, mild ATN vs.
pre-renal.  Improved after holding [**Last Name (un) **], lasix, nsaids and
hydration.
[**Last Name (un) **] and lasix re-initiated [**1-22**]. NSAID re-started [**1-24**]. On
discharge, serum creatinine was stable 1.6-1.9.
.
3. Epigastric Pain - new, acute onset. Resolved by [**1-19**]. RUQ
ultrasound negative for cholelithiasis. No evidence of
pancreatitis on scan. Seen by general surgery not felt to have a
surgical abdomen. Recommended follow-up colonoscopy-see below.
Continued PPI.  MRI chest/abdomen without evidence aortic
dissection
.
4. Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: Cough, fevers, opacity on cxr on
[**1-22**].  Given levoquin on [**1-22**], levoquin/vanc on [**1-23**] and then
changed to cefipime/levoquin [**1-24**].  Cefipime discontinued after
one dose--developed rash around IV site after infusion.
Levoquin continued for rest of course, defervesced, and to be
continued for 7 days on discharge.
.
5. Catheter Associated UTI: started levoquin on [**1-22**].  Grew
Morganella pan-sensitive by [**1-24**].  To get 7 day course for
catheter associated UTI on discharge.
.
6. Cecal/appendiceal thickening, inflammation: Seen by surgery,
recommended outpatient colonoscopy for follow up.  Should be
done within one month of discharge.
.
7. Rheumatoid Arthritis: maintained on oxycontin, prednisone.
NSAID held with ARF and re-started [**1-24**].
.
8. Asthma: maintained on advair, albuterol
.
9.
