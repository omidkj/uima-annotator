Admission Date:  [**2177-3-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-4-11**]

Date of Birth:  [**2116-5-14**]             Sex:   M

Service: PLASTIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10416**]
Chief Complaint:
chronic R frontal scalp wound

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-26**]:
1. Debridement and removal of calvarial bone flap.
2. Placement of titanium mesh cranioplasty.
3. Debridement of scalp open wound.
4. Soft tissue reconstruction with right radial forearm
    free flap with subsequently split thickness skin graft.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60y.o. man who suffered a myocardial infarction
in [**2170**] that
required him to undergo angioplasty and stent placement and
ongoing Coumadin therapy. He subsequently developed an acute
subdural hematoma on the right side that required emergent
evacuation and craniectomy that was performed at the [**Hospital1 3372**]. Following adequate clinic stabilization, his
cranial bone flap was replaced; however, he subsequently
developed a chronic draining wound in his right frontal scalp
that has persisted for the subsequent seven years. He has been
followed intermittently by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the Plastic
Surgery Clinic and was last seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in his
clinic on
[**2177-1-20**]. During the course of that evaluation, the
patient was recommended for a CT scan that showed necrosis of
the central portion of the patient's right frontal/temporal bone
flap that appears to be associated with full thickness bone loss
at the central portion of the flap. He presented on [**3-26**] for
cranioplasty and free flap scalp reconstruction.

Past Medical History:
- CAD s/p MI with PCI ([**12/2170**])
- R frontal ICH ([**1-/2171**]) in setting of anticoagulation for MI
- AML s/p chemo in [**2156**], in remission
- h/o seizures
- Anal fissure [**2170**]
- OSA
- HTN
- Hyperlipidemia
- H/o 'MRSA infection' in [**12/2170**]
- Depression

Social History:
no EtOH or Smoking. The patient is married, lives at home with
his wife and works as an office manager.

Family History:
Mother - died at 83 of cirrhosis [**1-18**] surgical complications of
[**Name (NI) 10259**]
Father - died at 57 secondary to CAD

Physical Exam:
Pre-op:
AVSS
Gen: well appearing, NAD
HEENT: obvious depression in the superior frontal region of his
scalp with an associated, approximately 1 cm diameter draining
sinus tract that is productive of fibrinous material. There is
no surrounding erythema, but there is significant chronic
inflammatory tissue surrounding this tract site.
Lungs: CTA
Heart: RRR
Abd: soft, N-T, N-D


Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2177-3-27**] 4:48 PM

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to head CT from [**2177-1-22**] and head MR
from [**2177-2-12**].
The previously seen craniotomy bone flap has been removed and
there is a new mesh in the craniotomy defect. There is overlying
soft tissue air as well as a new scalp flap. Surgical clips are
seen within the flap.
There is a tiny amount of air deep to the mesh. There is
heterogeneous high- density material immediately under the mesh,
which may represent post-surgical fluid, but if there is concern
for infection, this could be further evaluated with MR.
Again seen is encephalomalacia of the adjacent right frontal
lobe. There are no intracranial hemorrhages.
Again seen is a dilated CSF space in the left middle cranial
fossa, consistent with an arachnoid cyst.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are unchanged in size.
The visualized orbits appear normal. The visualized paranasal
sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhages.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2177-3-31**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate to severe focal left ventricular hypokinesis with
akinesis of the anteroseptum and anterior walls and hypokinesis
of the inferoseptum and anterolateral walls (LVEF ?30 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**3-26**] for cranioplasty and free radial
scalp flap for chronic, non-healing scalp wound. The infected
cranial graft was removed and a titanium mesh placed. Next a
free flap was taken from the R radial forearm and transposed to
the scalp. A split thickness skin graft from the thigh was used
for the radial wound. A lumbar drain was placed intra-op by
neurosurgery to minimize pressure on the repair. The patient was
transferred to the ICU ventilated following surgery for post op
management. He was extubated on POD#1. Flap doppler checks were
performed frequently post-operatively and showed good pulses.
He was transferred to the floor on [**3-31**].

NEURO:
On POD#1 the patient had 2 witnessed generalized tonic-clinic
seizures. He was treated acutely with ativan and neurology was
called. The patient reported missing an unspecified number of
tegretol doses prior to admission. The patient was loaded with
dilantin and put on a course of dilantin and tegretol.  Tegretol
levels were drawn to follow the level which remained
subtherapeutic for most of the hospital course and required 2
additional loading doses. Ativan was used to bridge between the
dilantin and tegretol, and the dilantin was tapered off, being
discontinued on [**4-9**]. Tegretol level was increased [**4-11**] for
discharge with follow up with patient's primary neurologist on
[**4-18**].
Lumbar drain: post op 20cc/hour were drained with clamping of
the drain in the interim. This was tapered to 10cc/h after 48h
and the drain was d/c'd on [**3-31**] without complication.

Cardiology: the patient was tachycardic post-op and required
beta blockade and diltiazem to reduce his rate. He did remain
normotensive post-op.

ID:The patient was initially covered with vancomycin and zosyn.
OR tissue cultures grew MRSA. Blood cultures and CSF cultures
had no growth.Zosyn was d/c'd on [**3-28**] following reports from the
OR cultures. Rifampin was started on [**4-2**] for additional
coverage per ID consult's recommendation.

Wound: The radial donor site was initially treated with a VAC
dressing. This was taken down on [**4-1**] and the wound was dressed
with xerform and kerlix and changed daily. The graft took well
an continued to heal without complication. The STSG donor site
was dressed with xeroform and allowed to dry.

Nutrition: the patient started a clear liquid diet on POD#1 and
a regular heart healthy diet on POD#2.
