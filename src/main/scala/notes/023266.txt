Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84 yo M with h/o COPD, GERD, bullous pemphigoid, prostate CA,
CVA, who is a long term resident at NewBridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **].
Presents today after a work-up of increasing confusion on
morning of [**2147-5-8**] prompted labwork, which revealed an
elevated creatinine and a leukocytosis. This was in setting of
patient being on an elevated dose of prednisone to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **]
since [**2147-5-2**]. Patient's recent past medical history
significant for hypertension with SBPs to 230 associated with
chest pain on [**2147-5-5**]. Beta blocker was increased at that
time. Patient's oxycodone was increased day prior to admission
due to increased complaints of non-focal pain.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 98.1, HR 72, BP 128/42, RR 26,
O2Sat 95% 2L. CT scan showed large amount of urine in the
bladder. RUL lung nodule reportedly suspicious for infection per
CT chest. Was given 1g of Vanc and 1 g Cefepime in setting of a
leukocytosis of 24.9. Abdomen CT showing bladdder wall
thickening and distended bladder. Foley was replaced, and he
drained 650 mL urine. Abdominal discomfort improved with this
measure. Was on [**2-21**] L supplemental oxygen throughout ED course.
Reportedly remained confused throughout ED course. Prior to
transfer to the ICU, VS were: T 99, HR 60, BP 120/80, RR 18,
O2Sat 95% 5L FM.
.
Upon arrival to the floor the patient reports that his breathing
is comfortable. He has some left leg pain, that is chronic. He
denies any fever or chills. Notes that his cough is at its 6
year baseline.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2147-5-14**]):    NO GROWTH.

[**2147-5-13**] 1:30 pm BLOOD CULTURE -> Blood Culture, Routine
(Pending):

Radiology:
**CXR ([**5-12**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Ground-glass opacities at the right mid lung concerning for
infectious
process, or aspiration.
2. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, with stable minimal blunting
of the
costophrenic angles.
3. Stable mild cardiomegaly.

**CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**5-8**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight enlargement of right upper lobe ground-glass nodule,
with
development of adjacent opacities that could represent either
infection/inflammation, or progression of indolent malignancy
such as
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.
2. Marked bladder distension and new hydronephrosis, without
evidence of
obstructing stones. Mild questionable left sided bladder wall
thickening.
Nonemergent evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT, MR (as renal
function
allows) or ultrasound is recommended. Urologic consultation
should be
considered.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of these findings on [**2147-5-8**] at 7:15 p.m.
Per resident
report, patient had incorrect Foley placement, and revision
yielded a large
amount of fluid with associated pain relief.
3. Stable infrarenal abdominal aortic ectasia.

**TTE ([**5-12**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
calcific aortic stenosis. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2142-9-3**], aortic sclerosis has progressed to
mild stenosis and pulmonary pressures are higher. The other
findings appear similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. [**Last Name (un) **] due to obstructive uropathy:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38030**] was admitted to MICU for increasing confusion,
elevated Cr to 6.7 (baseline <1), fever, leukocytosis.  CT had
demonstrated large volume of urine in bladder, and foley was
placed, draining urine (roughly 650ml). UA was wnl, BCx was
sent. The foley catheter was left in place and patient continued
to make good urine output. Pt PSA was found to be 33.6 (from
34.5 in [**1-/2147**], 7.8 in [**10/2146**]), raising concern of obstructive
uropathy [**12-20**] prostate ca enlargement.  On [**5-10**] patient Cr had
normalized to 1.1. A few days after ICU discharge pt was given a
voiding trial which he
