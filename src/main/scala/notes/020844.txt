History of Present Illness:
70-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including
CAD s/p PCI, BOOP/COP with bronchiectasis, PAD, renal artery
stenosis, hypertension who was referred by her Pulmonary
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: "70 year old female with chief complaint
of recurrent anginal symptoms. Known CAD and abrupt worsening of
oxygenation, with concern for PE. Had CT earlier today before I
saw her, but w/o contrast. Hx of BOOP which has responded to
Pred/MTX in past." The patient reports that her overall
worsening began in [**Month (only) 359**] when she developed a cough and
wheeze. She has never had a wheeze before despite multiple
episodes of BOOP/COP. In [**Month (only) **], the patient was seen at [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital for sharp chest pain, where a heart attack was
ruled out but the patient did not receive a stress (according to
her report). She was placed on Keflex, then Avelox and seen by
ENT for development of sores in her nose, which she still
complains of. The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] because of
increased shortness of breath and has been on prednisone and
methotrexate for a suspected recrudescence of BOOP/COP. Over the
past week, however, the patient has had intermittent short-lived
episodes of substernal chest heaviness, which she reports most
closely resemble angina from her previous heart problems (which
include 3 stents in her coronary vessels; the patient also
reports renal artery stents and what seem to be iliac stenting
on left). The patient reports that her angina-like symptoms do
indeed appear upon exertion and appear to be relived with rest.
Over the past week, however, the patient has also had an
increased oxygen requirement at home and desaturates upon
activity into the mid 70s (she has a finger pleth at home).
Finally, the patient has been reporting dysphagia-type symptoms,
where food and pill seem to get stuch at the bottom of her
esophagus. She has had a barium swallow and reports she has been
asked to have an endoscopy as well. She further mentions having
occaional positive ANCA tests in past (when I was querying about
her nasal sores). The patient also mentions that all of her
symptoms started in [**Month (only) **] after she developed an itchy foot
rash that has cleared since the introduction of prednisone.
.
In the Emergency Department, the patient's initial vital signs
were P 0, T 98.4, HR 72, BP 155/60, RR 22, 91% on 2L. The
patient underwent chest X-rat, chest CT, and then CTA after
having an elevated d-dimer. Her first troponin was negative.
Upon leaving the ED, her vitals were T 98.4, BP 133/55, HR 66,
RR 22, 97% on 4L.
.
On the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed, although
conversation makes her short of breath. A short walk caused her
systolic blood pressure to read in the 190s. After a brief rest,
her SBP has returned to the 150s.

Imaging:
CT Chest ([**11-24**]):
IMPRESSION: Acute exacerbation of a more chronic fibrotic
process with a
segmental distribution. The more chronic process is most likely
fibrotic
NSIP. This is not the radiologic appearance of COP.
- Coronary calcifications.
- There is calcification of the mitral annulus.
- Decrease in size in mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
- Hiatal hernia.
.
CXR ([**11-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased interstitial markings, correlating with the history
of organizing pneumonia.
2. Increased bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or
potentially
infection.
.
CTA Chest ([**11-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings compatible with known interstitial disease and
inflammatory airways disease. The only change is increased
diffuse attenuation of lung parenchyma which may be due to
differences in technique although superimposed processes such as
edema are not excluded.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3. Diffusely enlarged intrathoracic nodes, similar in size.
4. Atherosclerosis.
.
Echo ([**11-25**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well
seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy and normal cavity size with preserved
global biventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated aortic
arch. No clinically significant valvular regurgitation or
stenosis. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
