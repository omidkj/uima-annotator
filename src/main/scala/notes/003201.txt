Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status after dialysis on [**2156-5-5**]

History of Present Illness:
 72F h/o T2DM, ESRD on HD, GAVE, HTN, MR, CAD, CHF w/ RV failure
and seizure disorder who presented to the ED on [**5-5**] after
experiencing somnolence at dialysis. It is not known how much
fluid was removed during HD. The pt has no recollection of being
at dialysis. In the ED, she stated that she felt fine, and
denied HA, vision changes, nausea, weakness, or sensory changes.
She also specifically denied any f/c/ns, abdominal pain, or CP.
She did report a non-productive cough for several days and
gradually worsening shortness of breath.
.
ED course: VS: 97.4, 121, 104/68, 14, 91RA
Ms. [**Known lastname **] mental status cleared throughout her course in the
ED.
She had no leukocytosis, and chem 7 was notable for K 2.7, Mg
1.5, Phos 0.5, with new mild elevations in her transaminases,
alk phos and Tbili. CT head was negative. CXR with improving
effusion but satting 91% RA. RUQ U/S was done given elevated
LFTs: there was a negative son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) **] sign, and
echogenic focus within GB wall c/w sludge, unchanged from [**Month (only) **]
[**2155**]. Levaquin was given for possible PNA. Pt also received
gentle IVF (1L NS), potassium and D50 as her BG was in the 60s
and her K was 2.7. HR improved slightly to the 100s at
admission.

Of note, shortly after being transfered to the floor, she
developed [**Year (4 digits) **].  She was triggered and transfered to the
MICU.

Reports:

CXR [**5-5**] - AP upright and lateral views of the chest are
obtained.
Cardiomegaly is again noted with large tapering left pleural
effusion. Right lung is essentially clear and unchanged. There
is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Osseous structures reveal a compression fracture
in the upper- to-mid thoracic spine which is new since [**2156-1-19**].
CT head [**5-5**] - IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage, edema, or fracture.
US liver [**5-5**] - Moderate ascites with gall bladder wall
thickening and edema, unchanged from prior study, likely due to
third spacing. No evidence of acute cholecystitis. Echogenic
focus within the gall bladde possibley adherent sludge.

CT chest [**5-6**] - CONCLUSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. Extensive
atherosclerosis is present in the coronary arteries and there is
an aberrant origin of the right coronary artery which traverses
between the aortic root and the pulmonary artery.
2. Cardiomegaly, pleural and pericardial effusion as well as
ascites could
represent congestive cardiac failure. There has been significant
interval
increase in the right pleural effusion with almost complete
collapse/atelectasis of the left lung.
3. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are unchanged since the
prior examination and may be assessed further to exclude
indolent lymphoma.

Echo [**5-13**] - A small secundum atrial septal defect is present
(cine loop #34). There is mostly left-to-right shunting, but
after injection of aerated saline into the right atrium,
right-to-left bubble transit is seen, as well. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal [**Month/Year (2) 7216**] septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to
fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Preserved
left ventricular sy
