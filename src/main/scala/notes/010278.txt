HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 25557**] is a 67 year old
man who was in his usual state of health until four to five
months prior to admission when he began experiencing
shortness of breath on exertion and at rest, which he
attributed to his asthma.  The patient's symptoms worsened,
causing him to see his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2165-10-28**],
who sent him to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.  The patient was found
to have a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with a troponin of
8.5 and to be in rapid atrial flutter / atrial fibrillation.
He was treated with Lovenox and Lopressor in the Emergency
Department.

Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2165-10-31**], which
revealed total occlusion of the left anterior descending and
90% stenosis of the right coronary artery.  His ejection
fraction was estimated at 20%.  The patient was rate
controlled and diuresed and then transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for Cardiothoracic Surgery
consultation and possible cardiac catheterization and
stenting.

Upon arrival, the patient denied chest pain, pressure,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post non-Q wave myocardial infarction on
[**2164-10-28**].
2.  Status post atrial fibrillation.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Status post left knee replacement in [**2160**].
6.  Status post colon cancer.
7.  Status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy with
resection of colon times two in [**2148**] and [**2160**].
8.  Status post surgery for basal cell carcinoma on the left
ear.
9.  Status post ventral hernia repair in [**2163**].

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin.
2.  Aspirin, shortness of breath, laryngeal swelling.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother died at 85 from heart disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is employed as a manager of a
laundry plant in [**Hospital1 1474**], [**State 350**].  He lives with his
wife in [**Name (NI) 1474**].  He has a 50 pack year history of tobacco.
He has not smoked tobacco for the past 25 years.  He has
occasional alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On physical examination in general, a
pleasant man in no apparent distress appearing his stated
age.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles are intact.  Normal buccal mucosa.
Normal dentition.  Mucous membranes were moist.  Chest with
mild crackles at the left base; otherwise no wheezing or
rhonchi.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen obese, soft, nontender,
nondistended, without guarding, rebound or rigidity.
Extremities warm with mild bilateral leg edema symmetrically.
 No clubbing or cyanosis.  No varicosities.  Palpable pulses.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially referred to
Cardiac Surgery, however, it was unclear how much of the
infarcted area supplied by the left anterior descending was
still viable.  Thus, a decision was made to take the patient
to cardiac catheterization.  The patient underwent repeat
cardiac catheterization on [**2165-11-4**].

The patient underwent a limited coronary angiography to the
right coronary artery as the left anterior descending had
already been shown to be totally occluded.  An right coronary
artery focal 80% mid vessel lesion was noted.  The patient
underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stenting of the mid right coronary artery
using a 3 by 8 millimeter cypher stent which was then post
dilated using a 3.5 millimeter balloon.

A good post procedure affect was noted.  Because the patient
reported a severe allergy to aspirin, aspirin therapy was
withheld.  Instead, the patient was started on an alternative
anti-platelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**], sulfinpyrazone.  In addition, he was
started on Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.  Since the patient had a
history of recent Plavix use, he was not loaded with Plavix
prior to starting him on his daily 75 mg.

Two days after the procedure on [**2165-11-6**], the patient
suffered a witnessed ventricular fibrillation arrest on
Telemetry and was promptly defibrillated.  EKG at that time
showed a complete heart block with a ventricular escape
rhythm.  At this time, he was emergently transferred to the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for evaluation and
treatment.

The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed that the right
coronary artery stent that had been previously placed was
totally occluded with thrombus just proximal to the mid
vessel stent.  An IBP was placed and the patient showed
marked elevation of right and left heart filling pressures
with a normal cardiac index.  A successful rheolytic
thrombectomy with percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of the right coronary artery was performed using
the Angioject catheter.  The patient was then admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit for further care.

An echocardiogram was obtained the following day which showed
that the left ventricular wall size was normal but that the
left ventricular systolic function was severely depressed
with hypokinesis and akinesis of all visualized segments.
The patient remained intubated after his ventricular
fibrillation arrest and cardiac catheterization.

The balloon pump was successfully weaned over the following
days and the patient was extubated uneventfully.  He was then
seen by the Electrophysiology Service who recommended
placement of an ICD prior to discharge.  The patient was then
transferred to the floor status post ICD placement.

Because of the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and
his history of severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
he was started on heparin and Coumadin with a plan to
discharge him once he became therapeutic on Coumadin.

On the day after the initiation of heparin and Coumadin
therapy, the patient developed a hematoma at his cardiac
pacemaker site.  The heparin was thus discontinued and a
repeat consultation with the Electrophysiology Service was
obtained.  A consensus decision was made to maintain the
patient on Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q. day as his hematoma at the
pacemaker site resolved.

The patient was seen by Physical Therapy who felt that he
could perform activities of daily living.  At the time of
discharge, he was able to climb five flights of stairs and to
walk around the hospital floor without shortness of breath or
difficulty.

In addition, the patient was maintained on amiodarone after
his episode of ventricular fibrillation arrest and he was
started on aspirin after undergoing aspirin desensitization.
His Plavix dose was also increased from 75 mg to 150 mg p.o.
q. day.  Aspirin desensitization was uneventful.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure, systolic and diastolic
dysfunction.
2.  Acute myocardial infarction.
3.  Old myocardial infarction.
4.  Ventricular tachycardic arrhythmia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 150 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day.

4.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. three times a day.
5.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q. day.
