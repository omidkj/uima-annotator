Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea/vomiting, L arm weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 83yo R handed man with HTN, [**Hospital **] transferred
from [**Hospital **] hospital with subacute L PICA infarction. He was
initially transferred to the Neurosurgery service out of a
concern for a possible hemorrhage, however on review of the
imaging, there is no evidence for hemorrhage or edema in need of
neurosurgerical intervention.

As per the neurosurgery admission note, the patient patient
reports carrying his daughters dog into the car around 6pm 4
days
ago when he noted the sudden onset of intense nausea, "dry
heaves," as well as dizziness and feeling unsteady on his feet.
He sat down in his daughter's car and was unable to be moved and
he was then taken via EMS to [**Hospital **] Hospital. There he noted
his
left arm "felt numb." The patient was admitted to the hospital
for evaluation of mild RUQ pain. Abdominal CT revealed
cholithiasis and no cholecystitis. A mass at the bladder trigone
was noted. Given the pt's protracted N/V and left arm symptoms
an
MRI brain was performed today at 2pm. Study revealed subacute L
PICA infarct. MRA was degraded by motion, there is a R dominant
vertebral artery. L vert not visualized.

The patient notably reports focal left neck tenderness. He is
otherwise without diplopia, headache, difficulty producing or
comprehending speech. His gait is quite unsteady and he has not
been walking since admission to [**Hospital1 **] four days ago.

On gen ROS, denies fever, chills, night sweats or  weight loss.
He has continued nausea and poor appetite. He denies CP and SOB.
He does report L shoulder pain.

Social History:
Married, lives with his wife and daughter, he is a
retired computer engineer who worked on hardware for Compaq,
never smoker, rare ETOH, no illicit or IV drug use.


Family History:
both parents lived "long lives" and died in old age.

Imaging:
Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of
the distal septum and apex. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I
(mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No left ventricular thrombus seen. Mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild aortic and
mitral regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.

TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricle is not
well seen. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality secondary to hiatal hernia.
No LA/LAA thrombus seen. No PFO/ASD at rest or with maneuvers.
Complex (>4mm, nonmobile) atheroma in the aortic arch and simple
plaque in the descending aorta.
CXR:
The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened,
consistent with
COPD. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. The aorta is
slightly
unfolded. There is a moderate-sized hiatal hernia. There are
small bilateral
pleural effusions seen on the lateral view posteriorly. No CHF.
Doubt focal
infiltrate. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Probable small
calcified
granuloma in the right mid zone measuring approximately 3.5 mm
and overlying
the right fifth anterior rib. Degenerative changes of the
thoracic spine are
noted. Possible minimal anterior wedging of several lower
thoracic vertebral
bodies is suggested, unlikely to be acute.

IMPRESSION:
1) Background COPD.
2) Small bilateral effusions posteriorly. Doubt acute
infiltrate.
3) Moderate- sized hiatal hernia.

Head CT/CTA:
HEAD CT: There is a hypodense lesion in the left cerebellar
hemisphere
causing effacement of the fourth ventricle, consistent with
acute left
cerebellar infarct with history of left PICA. There is no
evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, elsewhere in the brain. The
ventricles and
sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. The basal
cisterns are patent.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are cle
