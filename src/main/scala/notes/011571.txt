History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 73F with an extensive PMH including ?lung
resection? for breast CA, CAD s/p 3x CABG, CHF, chronic
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring recent BIPAP at home.
She had recently been discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab from a
West-[**Location (un) 669**] VA CCU admission for ?CHF exacerbation and was
discharged on bipap which she received for a few days and then
stopped because she was doing so well. She also experienced some
worsening skin rash/pruritis/burning and had been requesting
pain medications which were given conservatively at first. Then
(according to the family) she was given 20mg po Morphine "plus
some other narcotics" and was soon noted to be non-responsive.
EMS was called who gave her narcan, to which she responded.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she was noted again to be
non-responsive and apneic. She became hypotensive and went into
PEA arrest. CPR was performed approximately x 30 seconds as per
ED report and she received epi and atropine x1 along with
amiodarone for unclear reason with return of blood pressure. She
was subsuquently intubated and started on a levophed drip. She
received levofloxacin, metronidazole. A femoral arterial line
and femoral chordus was inserted.
.
On ROS as per family, she endorsed burning skin as above, rash,
8lb wt gain in past week, denies SOB, dysuria, fevers, or other
concerns.
.

CXR:
Low lung volumes.  Hazy opacity of the left lung field may
represent a layering effusion.  Additionally, there may be
several patchy
opacities in the left upper and lower lung, and possibly in the
right
perihilar region.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old female with residual LLL PNA admitted with
unresponsiveness followed by PEA arrest, hypotension, and
respiratory failure intubation.
.
# PEA arrest: clinical history suggests apnea likely causing
hypoxia/hypercarbia and likely resultant PEA arrest.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt with likely underlying hypercarbic
respiratory failure as per daughter's history.  Ms
[**Last Name (un) 70759**] was attempted to ventilate at low tidal volumes
given her history of lung rescection.  She was treated for
pneumonia broadly with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
metronidazole.  She eventually became further volume overloaded
as her renal failure progressed and more difficult to ventilate.
.
# shock: Etiology likely [**1-5**] sepsis from unknown source.  Ms
[**Name13 (STitle) 70760**] was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin,
levofloxacin, flagyl) to treat a presumed pulmonary source.  Ms
[**Known lastname **] was maintined on vasopressors, initially with levophed.
As her hospital course progressed she became progressively
hypotensive despite IVF bolus.  She she was started and
phenylephrine in addition but developed a severe lactic acidosis
and abdominal distension which was hypothesized to be secondary
to gut ischaemia and her pressors were changeed to dopamine and
vasopressin with high requirements.
.
# acute renal failure: Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted with an elevated
Cr of 2.6 above her baseline of Cr 1.8, now 2.6. It was
considered likely to be [**1-5**] ATN + prerenal state.  Her renal
failure worsened during her admission despite agressive fluid
recussitation and eventually became anuric and progressively
acidotic with a lactic acidosis.  Discussions with nephrologists
and the families were held and it was decided that the family
did not want to pursue dialysis given her very poor overall poor
prognosis.
.
# Skin: Due to Ms [**Known lastname 70761**] severe skin changes,
dermatology was consulted who felt that her condition was likely
either Acute generalized erythematous pustulosis or severe
pustular psoriasis; they did not feel that it was superinfected.
 She was treated with steroid creams but her condition worsened
with desquamation of her skin which likely contributed to her
electrolyte abnormalities and acidosis.
.
# Due to Ms [**Known lastname 70762**] severe illness which worsened despite
aggressive critical care, a meeting was held with the family and
the decsiion was to make the patient DNR and to not escalate
care (meaning not to initiate dialysis).  She was maintaned on
vasopressors and antibiotics with ventilator support.  Her
condition worsened over 24 hours and she became progressively
hypotensive, acidotic, and died of cardiac arrest.  The family
was at her side and a priest was called.  The family declined a
post-mortem examination.
