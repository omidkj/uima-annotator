History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2150**] is a 67M with HIV (Cd4 183, VL 96 copies/mL) and end
stage COPD on 3-4L home O2 with a FEV1 of 0.5 who presented to
the emergency room on [**2152-2-15**] with increased shortness of
breath. Three days prior to presentation he developed nasal
congestion and rhinorrhea which made it difficult for him to use
his supplemental oxygen at home. He had subjective fevers and
chills but did not check his temperature. He had minimal cough
productive of dark yellow sputum. He was feeling more short of
breath despite increasing oxygen use. He was concerned about
pneumonia and presented to the emergency room.
.
In the emergency room his initial vitals were T: 98.1 HR: 86 RR:
107/72 RR: 22 O2: 100% on RA. He had a chest xray which showed
significant hyperinflation but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
He received levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, duonebs, solumedrol 125
mg IV x 1 and aspirin 81 mg. He was initially admitted to the
floor.
.
While on the floor he was started on azithromycin, solumedrol
125 mg IV TID, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers. He did well
on hospital day 1 but overnight his shortness of breath
worsened. He had a repeat CXR which was similar to priors. He
had an ABG on a non-rebreather which was 7.37/57/207/34. He had
increased work of breathing and asked to be placed on "a machine
for breathing." He is transferred to the MICU for non-invasive
ventilatory support.
n the MICU he was intubated an an A-line was placed due to
increased
WOB. Blood pressure was elevated while in respiratory distress
and he was treated with hydralazine. He had one episode of
hypotension responsive to IVF. A right IJ central line placed.
ABG on [**2-18**] was 7.32/54/104. Methylprednisolone was decreased to
60mg IV BID. He was extubated on ICU day 3 and initially
appeared in stress but did well after small dose IV morphine.He
was transferred to the floor on ICU day 4. Prior to transfer he
reviewed his code status and decided to be DNR/DNI.
.
On the floor, he is doing relatively well. He reports he is
still somewhat short of breath but not in any distress. He
reports back pain secondary to old back injury. He will be
spending time with family and friends who are coming in from
around the country to see him. Reports lack of appetite but no
n/v. Denies F/C cough, chest pain.
