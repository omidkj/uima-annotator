Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 663**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
2.  colonoscopy
3.  blood transfusion


History of Present Illness:
73 yr old male with hx of CAD s/p recent ant MI with stent [**5-12**],
CHF, EF of 35% and a hx of GIB in [**2162**] who presents to the ED
with BRBPR. During the night prior to admission, pt had three
liquid bowel movements consisting of dark liquid with some
bright red blood and blood noted on the toilet paper. He denies
chest pain, abd pain, nausea but does have mild dizziness. Of
note, pt had an anterior MI with stent placement in [**5-12**] and
thus has been on ASA and plavix. When pt had a GIB in [**2162**], his
ASA was d/c'd. EGD at that time showed a duodenal ulcer and some
erosions while a colonoscopy showed only diverticula.
.
In [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] NG lavage was done and was negative though no bile
return noted either. Pt had 3 large bloody bowel movements in
the ED but remained hemodynamically stable. His hct was 31 and
he was tranfused one unit of PRBCs. He was also given one liter
of NS. GI evaluated the patient and brought him the endoscopy
suite for an EGD. Nothing was seen on EGD but after more
hematochezia (last episode ~6 p.m.), it was determined that the
pt was too unstable for the floor given that the source of the
bleed was still unknown and he was admitted to the MICU. In MICU
had been transfused 2U PRBCs since admission [**8-19**], remained HD
stable, has started Golytely prep and is still not clear, so he
will go for colonoscopy [**8-21**].

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed, presumed small bowel: As detailed
predominantly in HPI.
In ED on admission, pt had an NG lavage which was negative,
though no bile return noted either. Pt had 3 large bloody bowel
movements in the ED but remained hemodynamically stable. His hct
was 31 and he was tranfused one unit of PRBCs. He was also given
one liter of NS. GI evaluated the patient and brought him the
endoscopy suite for an EGD. EGD unrevealing.  Once transferred
from the MICU to the floor, colonscopy demonstrated colonic
diverticula that had been noted on a prior study, but was
otherwise unremarkable. Pt's hematocrit continued to slowly
fall, though he remained HD stable. Angiography performed
[**2167-8-21**] showed small blush of tracer activity in the right upper
quadrant which does not persist. It was unclear whether this
represents bleeding into the large bowel, in the region of the
hepatic flexure, or into the small bowel.  It was interpreted as
"weakly positive", though there was no intervention deemed to be
necessary based on this study. The patient continued to have
some melenic stool with small hct drops, though was HD stable
throughout his hospitalization after transfer to the medicine
floor. He received multiple blood transfusions to maintain hct
>30.  As pt had remained HD stable >4 days despite small hct
drop, and no intervention was indicated based on available data,
pt was discharged in good condition with instructions to follow
up for hct checks, as well as for possible further GI
intervention.
.
2. Diverticuli: Stable throughout admission.
.
3. Coronary artery disease: Stable throughout admission.
Decision was made by attending physician to hold ASA and Plavix
in light of continued bleeding. Pt was discharged with
instructions to hold Plavix until speaking again with PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **].
.
4. HTN: remained stable. Pt maintained on home regimen as BP
tolerated.
