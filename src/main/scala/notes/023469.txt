Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Left vocal fold immobility.
Non-small cell lung cancer.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2145-9-29**]: Left thoracotomy. Left upper lobectomy. Mediastinal
lymph node dissection
[**2145-10-1**]: OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a biopsy-proven cancer
arising from the left upper lobe. The cancer was 4 cm in size
and given the size of the tumor
we recommended an open approach.  The patient had limited
pulmonary function and we consented the patient for lobectomy,
but also were hopeful that the lesion could be resected by an
upper division segmentectomy.

Diastolic CHF, preserved EF
mitral stenosis,w mild to moderate AR, TR
Pulmonary hypertension
worsening vision, to be eval'd by optho soon for "legal
blindness," leg braces for bilateral drop foot and neuropathy
Depression/anxiety, migraine

PSHx: bioprosthetic valve [**2138**] complicated by wound infections,
dehiscence


Social History:
Patient lives alone, smoke 1 pack/day, no alcohol or
recreational drug use.


Family History:
Father died from MI at age 45

Physical Exam:
99.2  98.7  68  120/62  18  97-RA

GEN: NAD
HEENT: OP clear, edentulous, raspy voice
NECK: supple, full ROM, no LAD
CV: RRR, s1/s2
LUNGS: breath sounds bilaterally, diffuse wheezes
ABD: s/nt/nd
EXT: warm/dry
INCISION: well-approximating without evidence of infection

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**2145-10-3**]: Postoperative changes status post left upper
lobectomy with leftward mediastinal shift. There is a large left
hydropneumothorax with a left chest tube terminate within the
apical aspect of the hydropneumothorax. Near complete
atelectasis of the left lung with opacification of the left
bronchus and its visualized branches, suggesting mucous plug or
blood. Patchy ground-glass opacity throughout the right lung
concerning for developing pnemonia vs. edema. Mildly enlarged
main pulmonary artery measuring 3.7 cm.

CXR:
[**2145-10-7**]: The fluid component of the moderate left
hydropneumothorax is slightly increased. Subcutaneous gas in the
left chest wall is unchanged. Multifocal opacities in the right
upper and lower lung and left lower lobe are improved, possibly
due to improving pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable.
[**2145-10-5**]: left-sided hydropneumothorax is slightly decreased.
More focal parenchymal opacities, greatest in the right upper
lobe could represent aspiration. The heart size is mildly
enlarged, however, unchanged. There is mild tortuosity of the
aorta. An aortic valve replacement is unchanged in position.
Deformity of the left posterior rib is unchanged.
[**2145-10-2**]: the left apical lateral pneumothorax. However, in the
interval, a large pleural effusion has also developed, the
effusion occupies approximately two-thirds of the volume of the
left hemithorax. There is thus, now, a large fluidopneumothorax.
The left lateral air collection in the soft tissues is
unchanged. Also unchanged are the post-operative rib defects.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 year-old female admitted [**2145-9-29**] for Left thoracotomy, Left
upper lobectomy.
Mediastinal lymph node dissection and Direct laryngoscopy with
operating telescope.
Local fold injection with Radiesse Voice gel. She was extubated
in the operating room, transfer to the PACU with a right chest,
Foley and Bupivacaine Epidural managed by the acute pain
service.  She transfer to the floor in stable condition.

Events: Chest CT [**2145-10-3**] negative for PE. Possible aspiration
Pneumonia on Right
Flexible bronchoscopy [**2145-10-4**] with BAL and large mucus plug
removal.

ID: spike temp 101, BAL with GNR, Ucx with E.coli, started on
Ceftriaxone. Outpatient antibiotics switched to PO cipro, with
fluconazole/clotrimazole for thrush seen on bronchoscopy.

Respiratory: aggressive nebs, ambulation, incentive spirometer;
her oxygen requirements improved with saturations of 95% @rest,
91-97% 1L activity

Chest-tube: left with moderate serousanguious discharge, removed
[**2145-10-5**].  Serial chest films showed left-sided
hydropneumothorax is slightly decreased, with slightly increased
fluid component. Focal parenchymal opacities showed improvement
by the day of discharge.

Cardiac: history of diastolic heart failure.  Her home
medications were titrated as her HR and blood pressure
tolerated.  She remained in sinus rhythm 70's blood pressure
110-140's.

GI: PPI and bowel regime.

Speech/Swallow: seen by speech for soft signs and possible
symptoms of aspiration
of thin liquids during today's bedside evaluation.  Given her
recent surgery and history, she is felt to be at high risk for
silent aspiration. pureed solids and nectar thick liquids were
started. Video-swallow [**2145-10-1**] no aspiration  safe for a PO
diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids.

Laryngology followed for left vocal cord immobility. Voice
should improve over 1-2 weeks.  Mild hoarsness while
hospitalized

Endocrine: blood sugars initially 200-300's, insulin sliding
scale adjusted lantus 10 [**Hospital1 **] continued.  AM BS low 48-99.
[**Hospital1 **] consulted recommended d/c PM lantus and start humalog
sliding scale at 180. Her blood sugars improved, lantus PM dose
was slowly restarted prior discharge.

Renal: IV fluids were maintained until taking PO's. Urine output
improved. Gentle diureses was restarted on POD2.  Electrolytes
replete as needed

Pain: Bupivacaine/fentanyl Epidural managed by the acute pain
service.  The epidural was split on [**2145-10-1**] with Bupivacaine
and home MS Contin dose with good control.

Anxiety: very anxious following surgery requiring Ativan 1-2 mg
every 4-6 hours.  Once she restarted her home dose opioids her
anxiety improved.

Disposition: she was seen by physical therapy. She was
discharged on [**2145-10-8**].  She will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
