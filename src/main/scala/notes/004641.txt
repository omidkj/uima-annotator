FAMILY HISTORY:  A family history of uterine cancer,
depression, and multi-substance abuse.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been divorced since [**2169**];
and until [**2178**] she was living with her daughter.  Secondary
to the patient's drug abuse, the daughter evicted the patient
who was then homeless for about one year.  In [**2180-4-29**],
the patient took up residence at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] House.  In
early [**2180-7-30**], the patient was admitted to an
[**Hospital3 **] facility ([**Hospital1 **] at [**Hospital1 1426**]) by the
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] House.  The patient has a history of
polysubstance abuse including prescription opioids and
benzodiazepines as well as distant intravenous drug use.  The
patient denies alcohol abuse.  The patient has roughly a
30-pack-year history of smoking (one pack per day for about
30 years).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:   Upon discharge from the
[**Hospital1 69**], the patient's vital
signs were temperature of 98.4, heart rate was 47 to 70,
blood pressure was 150 to 174/84 to 104, respiratory was 18,
and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.  In general, an
obese Caucasian female in no apparent distress who had a
cushingoid appearance.  Skin was warm and well perfused.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed normocephalic
with ecchymoses over her right eyebrow.  Pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Lungs revealed occasional wheezes in the bilateral lower
lobes that were reversible with the patient's inhalers.
Otherwise, no crackles or rales.  Heart had a regular rate
and rhythm.  Second heart sound and second heart sound were
present.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was
obese, soft, and nontender.  Bowel sounds were present.
Extremities revealed 2+ pedal pulses.  No pedal edema.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII were grossly
intact.  Psychiatrically, the patient was occasionally
agitated; but otherwise showed no signs of depression or
anxiety.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION/LABORATORY AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  Upon
presentation to the [**Hospital6 1708**] the
patient's blood pressure was found to be 62/36.  She was also
found to have a potassium of 6.3, a hematocrit of 27.7, and
an eosinophil count of 13.5%.  The patient's urine toxicology
was positive for benzodiazepines.  There serum toxicology and
urine toxicology were otherwise negative for ingestions.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  In the Emergency Department,
the patient was given 10 units of insulin and calcium
gluconate, from which her calcium corrected to 5.4.  The
patient was also given 2 units of Narcan; after which she was
noted to be mildly more arousable.  The patient was seen to
be hypercarbic from her arterial blood gas of 7.23, PCO2
of 48, and PO2 of 64.  The patient was then intubated and
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Suspecting
adrenal insufficiency, the team then gave the patient doses
of hydrocortisone.  The patient responded, and her
hemodynamics stabilized.  Later on hospital day one, the
patient was able to be extubated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Hospital **] hospital events by systems were
as follows.

 1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  On hospital day two, the patient was
noted to be passing bright red blood per rectum.  A
gastrointestinal workup by colonoscopy revealed internal
hemorrhoids, but no other colonic lesions.  An upper
gastrointestinal and small-bowel follow-through film showed
no abnormalities of her upper gastrointestinal tract or
symptoms of bleeding.

On hospital day three, the patient had required 2 units of
blood; but otherwise her hematocrit stabilized into the
lower 30s.  This was thought to be due to a hemorrhoidal
bleed.  The patient's gastrointestinal bleed will be followed
by her primary care physician.

 2.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient has an initial cortisol of 3.1.
The patient was subsequently put on hydrocortisone 100 mg
q.8h.   Over the next two days, the patient's hydrocortisone
was tapered to 50 mg q.6h.   A cortisol stimulation test on
hospital day four showed physiological levels of cortisol
with a baseline cortisol of 32.  This result was felt to reflect
her hydrocortisone doses, and she was switched to dexamethasone.
Decision was made to repeat the [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test as an outpatient.
For a further workup, the patient will be following with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99814**] at the [**Hospital **] Clinic, on the [**Location (un) 1773**], on
Wednesday, [**9-6**] at 12:30 p.m.  The Endocrine team also
wished for a magnetic resonance imaging of the patient's head
and neck to further rule out malignancy.  However, during
this admission, the patient received a magnetic resonance
imaging but yet could not sit still for the study.  Hence, if
the Endocrine team wishes for a further magnetic resonance
imaging study, the patient can complete one as an outpatient.

 3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  During this admission, the patient
tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus and
tuberculosis.  The patient tested positive for Helicobacter
pylori.  The patient was subsequently treated with a 14-day
course of antibiotics.

The patient's hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B
surface antibody, and hepatitis C antibody were pending.
These results can be followed up with the patient's primary
care physician by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 16116**] and given the
patient's [**Hospital1 69**] medical record
number of [**Numeric Identifier 99815**].  At this point, the primary care physician
can have the results faxed to him.

 4.  NEUROLOGY:  Upon admission, the patient was minimally
responsive to painful stimulation, and her speech was
garbled.  The patient was also only transiently aware of her
s
