History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20598**] is an 84yo female with PMH significant for c.diff
sepsis, CAD, and atrial fibrillation who is being admitted to
the MICU for septic shock. Patient was recently discharged to
rehab on [**6-17**] after being hospitalized for septic shock thought
to be [**1-2**] c. diff infection. She underwent an elective left
total hip replacement at [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**4-27**]. She subsequently developed
diarrhea and was admitted to an OSH in [**Month (only) **] and was found to be
positive for c.diff toxin. She underwent an CT abd/pelvis during
this time which showed diffuse colonic wall thickening with
generalized mesenteric inflammation/edema. She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up and during this time
required pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
During her recent admission, she was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She
completed a course of PO Vancomycin for c.diff. Her hospital
course was also complicated by acute on chronic diastolic CHF
and she was placed on a Lasix gtt and was diuresed aggressively.
She also went into afib with RVR and was loaded with Amiodarone
and was anti-coagulated on Coumadin. She was already on Coumadin
given her history of DVT. She was discharged to [**Hospital 20605**] on [**6-17**].
This evening, the patient was found to be lethargic and febrile
to 102.5. Blood and urine cultures were drawn and her urine was
noted to be concentrated, foul, and dark.  She received Tylenol
2gm and was started on IVFs. In route to [**Hospital1 18**], she was
hypotensive and received IVFs.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.8 Tmax 101.5 BP 71/56 AR 96
RR 16 O2 sat 91% RA, 96% on 4L. She received Vancomycin, Cipro
400mg IV, and Flagyl 500mg IV. A RIJ central line was placed and
she received a total of 4L NS.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20598**] is an 84yo female with PMH as listed above who
presents with septic shock.

1)Septic shock: Patient presented with hypotension, tachycardia,
leukocytosis which was consistent with diagnosis of septic
shock. She started having increasing amounts of diarrhea at the
rehab facility and her urine was noted to be dark, concentrated,
and foul smelling at rehab. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
MICU for sepsis [**1-2**] c.diff. On admission, sepsis protocol was
initiated. She was pan-cultured and started on broad spectrum
antibiotics-Cipro, Vancomycin IV, PO Vancomycin, and Flagyl. The
c.diff toxin came back positive. Her antibiotic regimen was
weaned down to Flagyl IV and PO vancomycin. She should continue
Flagyl for 2 week course and she should continue the Vancomycin
PO which should be tapered over the next few months.
Vancomycin taper as follows:
125mg PO four times daily for 6 days (last dose q6hrs is on
[**2140-7-6**])
125mg PO twice daily for 7 days
125mg once daily for 7 days
125mg every other day for 7 days
125mg every 3 days for 14 days

2)Diastolic CHF: Patient has history of diastolic CHF and
required aggressive diuresis with a lasix gtt during her last
admission. Cardiac enzymes were negative. She initially appeared
volume overloaded on exam but is likely intravascularly dry
based on her CVP since she presented with sepsis. Her Lasix was
held given her hypotension and then restarted. She was restsrted
on her home lasix regimen of lasix 20mg PO BID.

3)Atrial fibrillation: Patient first diagnosed with afib w/RVR
during last admission. She is also anticoagulated with Coumadin.
On admission, she was restarted on Amiodarone. The beta-blocker
was held in light of her hypotension but then restarted after a
few days. Anti-coagulation was also held given the
supratherapeutic INR and coumadin 1.5mg PO daily was restarted
today when her INR was 2.1 (see details below).

4)Anemia: Baseline hematocrit per OMR is low to mid 30's. She
was transfused 2 units pRBCs in light of her hypotension. She
was also maintained on iron supplements. Her HCT has since been
stable.

5)Coagulopathy: Patient presented with elevated INR on
admission. Remains elevated on transfer to medical floor. Likely
[**1-2**] antibiotics she had received. She was restarted on coumadin
1.5mg PO daily today and should have daily INRs while at rehab
given her c. diff history, amlodipine, and antibiotic regimen.

6)Non anion gap acidosis: Likely [**1-2**] diarrheal losses and she
appears to be compensating based on the pH. Her bicarbonate
level was followed daily.

7)Hypertension: Her outpatient anti-hypertensive regimen was
initially held given hypotension and sepsis. The beta-blocker
was restarted after her hypotension resolved.  On several
occasions in the last few days we have administered her
beta-blocker despite SBP in the high 90s in order to control her
heart rate as she has A fib and diastolic heart failure.
