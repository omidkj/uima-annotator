History of Present Illness:
69 yo W with DM, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p multiple PCIs w/ most
recent DES x2 to LCX, CHF w/EF 20-25%, COPD on 2L home O2, PVD
(R foot [**First Name3 (LF) **]), OSA, Afib (not on coumadin [**2-6**] GIB) who presents
w/ chills, malaise, fever and n/v.
.
Pt. was in USOH, until the day of evaluation at 3pm, when she
developed a sensation of malaise, chills, sweats followed by
nausea and vomiting while cooking dinner.  Due to fatigue, she
decided to lay down and hand an episode of emesis (non bilious,
whitish colored).  Her daughter noted that she looked
diaphoretic and pale while laying in bed as well as c/o of
"twingy" chest dyscomfort. Temp at home was 101.8 at which time
EMS was called. Pt. denies any other preceeding sx, and infact
was seen by her cardiologist earlier and told that she was doing
well.  She denies fevers, cough, worsening SOB/DOE, PND or
orthopnea.  She did report intermittent substernal discomfort,
similar to her prior admission (see below).  She notes some
sacral pain at area of her prior cyst.  Also notes that her
right foot [**Month/Day (2) **] has not been healing and reports having had an
injection of "stem cells" into the [**Month/Day (2) **] by her podiatrist.  No
dysuria, loose bms, arthralgias or myalgias.  Notes intermittent
HA w/o photophobia.  Reports neck discomfort, unchanged from
prior.  No sick contacts.

Of note, pt. was admitted last [**2082-1-27**] to [**Hospital1 1516**] for CP, w/
lateral STd and flat CEs, s/p cath w/ LCX occlusion, s/p DESx2
for instent-restenosis, right ischemic foot [**Hospital1 **] consistent w/
chronic osteomyelitis (RLE angiogram w/ poor perfusion but no
distal targets and given poor BF surgical intervention was not
felt feasible.

While in EMS, pt. was given zofran and Nitro spray.  Initial VS
in ED were 102.5F 122 170/80 20 100% 12L.  Pt. was felt to be
tachypneic w/ increased WOB and somewhat confused.  Labs were
notable for WBC of 14K w/ left shifts and 4 bands, BNP 8K (prior
62K), Trop of 0.16, Cr 3.7 and lactate of 1.8.  ECG showed STd
I, V5-6, and in II, aVF along w/ STe V1-2. ED team d/w
cardiology who felt this was demand ischemia in setting of
increased demand.  She received Zofran/Reglan IV, Acetaminophen
650mg, ASA 300PR and 750mg IV Levofloxacin as well as 1L NS.
Although her HR decreased to 110s, SBP was in 90s and she was
admitted to MICU for hypotension.  VS on transfer were 110 92/41
23 97% 4L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt. appeared somewhat somnolent, but
easily arousable and appropriately responsive.  C/o some
discomfort in her sacrum that is unchanged over the past month.
Per daughter, her mother appears much improved in terms of color
and alertness.

[**2166-3-27**] CXR:
CONCLUSION:
Loculated fluid right base and chronic fluid in left base.
There is probably a small amount of increased fluid over the
prior radiograph. There is cardiomegaly and unusually orientated
sternal wires probably reflecting sternal dehiscence.

[**2166-3-30**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-29**], the monitoring
and support devices remain in place. Continued substantial
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural
effusions, compressive basilar atelectasis, and moderate
pulmonary ede
