History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of recurrent
pneumonias and shortness of breath who was found to have severed
tracheobronchomalacia with a particularly collapsed segment in
the right main stem bronchus and bronchus intermedius. In
[**11/2153**], he underwent tracheobronchial Y stenting and bronchus
intermedius silicone stenting to the open the collapsed
segments.  He experienced some relief of his dyspnea with this
stenting, but these stents were removed in [**1-/2154**] secondary to
granulation tissue and bleeding.  Because of his continued
constellation of symptoms including SOB, recurrent PNA, and
inability to clear his secretions and the profound anatomic
abnormalities in his central airways, surgical correction was
recommended.

The pt was extubated in the OR and transferred to the ICU in
stable condition.  Posteratively, the pt experienced hypotension
and was placed on pressors to keep MAP>60.  Pain control was
acheived with an epidural.

[**6-19**] CK 4000 - Started LR 150 ml/hr
[**6-20**] CK continued to elevate (from [**Numeric Identifier 2249**] to [**Numeric Identifier 7923**]).  Started
bicarbonated drip.

His CK began to trend down on [**6-21**] [**Numeric Identifier 58050**]--> 11,137-->
9522-->8234 ([**6-22**]) and his blood pressure began to stabalize
such that his phenyleprhine drip was weaned.  Also at this time
there was interval increase in the right pleural effusion.  On
[**6-23**], the patient had a bronchoscopy that showed a large amount
of edema and swelling, increased secretions, with near complete
blockage of the Right upper lobe. A BAL was also performed and
sent for culture but came back with 2+ PMN's only. At that time
IP felt that it was likely secondary to post-surgical edema and
was not related to infection given his negative BAL, lack of
fever, and normal white blood count. He was given albuterol
nebulizers and agressive pulmonary toilet and continued to
improve such that he was able to be transferred to the floor.

On the floor, the patient continued to improve and on [**6-24**]
his chest tube was removed and he tolerated it well. His f/u CXR
did not show a new pneumothorax.

On the day of discharge the patient had well controlled pain,
was ambulating, tolerating oral intake, voiding without
difficulty.
