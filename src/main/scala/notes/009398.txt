Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Patient and his nephew report several
years of low grade pancytopenia and progressive fatigue. In the
last year fatigue has reached the point that the patient has
difficulty with some activities of daily living such as
shoveling snow and ambulating outside of his house. Patient also
reports a recent weight loss but denies fevers, chills, or night
sweats. Given the progression of symptoms and counts a bone
marrow biopsy was performed which demonstrated a monoclonal B
cell population consistent with a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
Patient underwent 4 weekly doses of Rituximab in [**7-/2119**], with
improvement in splenomegaly, counts, and energy, but he had
relative rapid recurrence of disease. He was started on
R-Bendamustine 80mg/m2 x 2days on [**2120-2-9**].

OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypertension

[**2120-3-15**] ECHO
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45 %). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2120-2-8**], the pericardial effusion is slightly
larger; still no evidence of frank tamponade, but careful serial
clinical and echocardiographic followup is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old M with history of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/splenic
lymphoma s/p 4 weekly doses of Rituxan in [**7-/2119**], and recent
[**Last Name (un) 106229**]-R x2 (C2D1 on [**2-29**]) who is admitted for Rituximab
desensitization.

ACUTE
# Rituxan desensitization:
On recent admission [**Date range (1) 23751**], pt developed
hypotension/dyspnea/hypoxemia/fever during infusion of
rituximab. He was treated with tylenol, bendaryl, decadron,
hydrocortisone.  Started infusion on the evening of [**3-14**],
initially with low concentration then higher concentration.
While infusing the 3rd bag, he became tachypneic, tachycardic,
hypertensive (150/105)(had gotten benadryl 25mg at 10:30),
mildly stridorous and with rigors, gave an additional 25mg
benadryl and an albuterol neb. Infusion was held overnight. On
the following day it was restarted at a slower rate and was
well-tolerated. Discharged home with family.
.
#Dyspnea: CXR showed a large right sided pleural effusion of
unknown etiology. After his initial reaction to the rituxan, he
was given lasix for diuresis which improved his saturation and
his dyspnea.

CHRONIC
# Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: s/p four doses of Rituxan [**7-/2119**],
s/p C2 R-Bendamustine [**1-/2120**] c/b infusion reaction to Rituxan.
Received a unit of PRBCs for anemia.
.
#Seizure prophylaxis
-continue home keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

# Hypertension/CHF: Has mild sHF, recent echo EF 40-45%. In
setting of rituximab desensitization, held home lisinopril,
metoprolol and resumed on discharge.

# BPH:
-continue home oxybutynin

# Anemia:
Continued home iron supplementation. Received one unit PRBCs.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Chest xray shows large right pleural effusion of unknown
etiology.
# Echocardiogram shows an increasing pericardial effusion that
should be followed regularly.
