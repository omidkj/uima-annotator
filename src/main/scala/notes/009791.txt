Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2118-2-8**] Aortic Valve Replacement (21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic Porcine)

History of Present Illness:
74 year old woman was diagnosed with aortic stenosis in [**2117**]
after being worked up for a progressive decline in her activity
tolerance due to fatigue. Echocardiogram in [**2117-10-1**]
revealed moderate to severe aortic stenosis and mild to moderate
aortic regurgitation. She was recently referred for stress
testing where she was noted to have a progressive drop in
systolic blood pressure with increasing workloads. She is now
being referred for right and left heart catheterization to
further evaluate. With regard to symptoms, she denies any chest
pain or shortness of breath at rest or with exertion.  She also
denies lightheadedness, dizziness or syncope. Until recently,
she was walking from a half a mile to a mile per day at a slow
pace but she feels that her general energy level has declined
significantly. She is now being referred to cardiac surgery for
aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2118-2-8**] Echo: Prebypass: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Postbypass: The patient is AV-paced on a phenylephrine infusion.
There is a new prosthetic valve which is well seated in the
aortic position without evidence of regurgitation or
paravalvular leak. Peak/mean gradients are 18/10 mmHg with a
cardiac output of 3.22 L/min. Mitral regurgitation is now trace.
Tricuspid regurgitation has increased from trace to mild. Left
ventricular function continues to be normal. The thoracic aorta
is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admited on [**2-8**] and was brought to the operating room
where she underwent an aortic valve replacement. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Later this day she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-op day one beta-blockers and diuretics were initiated
and she was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Later on
post-op day one she was transferred to the step-down floor for
further care. She went into atrial fibrillation which was
treated with amiodarone and lopressor and she converted back to
sinus rhythm.  Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. She required very aggressive pulmonary
toilet due to her COPD history. She worked with physical therapy
for strength and mobility. Her pulmonary status slowly improved
and she was ready for discharged home on post-op day six with
appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.
