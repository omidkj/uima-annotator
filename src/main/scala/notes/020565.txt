History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 303**] presented to [**Hospital 1661**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 2848**] with
respiratory distress on [**2131-6-30**], was intubated, had an NSTEMI,
was diagnosed with 3 vessel disease and declined surgical
revascularization in [**Location (un) 2848**] preferring to come to [**State 350**]
where he has family (son and daughter). Newly diagnosed with
COPD and started on prednisone 20mg daily (which was stopped
prior to transfer) and spiriva and albuterol. Was discharged
from hospital in [**Location (un) 2848**], flew commercial air liner to [**Location (un) 86**] and
went directly to [**Hospital6 3105**] ER where
he was admitted and remained pain free. He was seen by
nephrology for Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (creat 1.9)
believed to be due to HTN and diabetes.
Found to have EBLR (enterococcus betalactame resistant to
quinolones)UTI- on nitrofurantoin ( also sensitive to bactrim
and zosyn). He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of
surgical revascularizationwith for known 3 vessel coronary
disease.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild
to moderate ([**12-4**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Mild to moderate
[[**12-4**]+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion. Effusion echo dense,
c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 65%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. This most
likely represents a postoperative hematoma and is located
posterior to the heart. No definite tamponade, but the usual
signs may be absent in the presence of a consolidating effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 303**] was admitted for further pre-operative evaluation.
Carotid ultrasound showed 70-79% stenosis bilaterally.  He is
asymptomatic and will follow-up with vascular surgery as an
outpatient.  An echo revealed EF 60% without significant
valvular disease.  Surgery was post-poned for several days due
to a rise in creatinine. This stabilized and the patient was
brought to the Operating Room on [**2131-7-23**] where the patient
underwent coronary artery bypass graft x5; left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft
to diagonal obtuse marginal, saphenous vein sequential graft to
posterior descending artery, and posterior left ventricular
branch with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  See operative note for full details.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight.  He did have an elevated creatinine
post operatively with a peak of 5.7.  Lasix was decreased and
kidney function was monitored closely.  His creatinine was
decreasing at the time of discharge. The foley catheter
