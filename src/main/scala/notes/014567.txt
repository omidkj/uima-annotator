Pertinent Results:
STUDIES

ECHO [**2143-10-2**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with
hypokinesis of the septum, apex and basal inferior wall. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2143-5-28**], the LVEF has decreased.

CTA [**10-10**]
1. Patent right common iliac and external iliac artery stents
with severe
narrowing at the distal portion of the right external iliac
artery stent.
Stable severe narrowing of the right popliteal artery at the
level of the knee with occlusion of the right anterior tibial
artery.
2. Complete occlusion of the left iliac artery stent with patent
aortofemoral bypass graft. Persistent complete occlusion of the
left superficial femoral artery with patent profunda which
reconstitutes at the popliteal. Complete occlusion of the left
posterior tibial artery at the ankle, but there is
reconstitution at the plantar arch.
3. Patent left renal artery stent.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions and septal thickening at the lung
bases which may be related to CHF.

Renal US [**10-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Suboptimal study, as detailed, with reversal of diastolic
flow noted in the interlobar arteries in the upper, mid, and
lower poles of the left kidney. These findings can be seen in
the setting of renal vein thrombosis.

FOOT XR [**10-7**]
There is significant diffuse osteoporosis, mostly affecting the
right foot but also seen on the left. Within the limitations of
this finding, no evidence of fracture is present. There is no
evidence of cortical destruction to suggest osteomyelitis, but
if clinically warranted further evaluation with MRI given its
increased sensitivity compared to chest radiograph is
recommended.

CXR
[**10-3**]
There is interval placement of right-sided PICC whose tip is
noted
to be in the right atrium. The course of the line is
unremarkable and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or other
complications. The heart is large with a prominent left fat pad
but no evidence of heart failure. The lung fields do not appear
significantly changed from previous study. There is no pleural
effusion.
