Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening mitral valve function, admit for evaluation for repair

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2119-3-22**]
Mitral valve repair, oversewing of left atrial appendage [**2119-3-28**]

History of Present Illness:
59 year old gentleman has a history
of cardiomyopathy, previous cardiac arrest and s/p ICD implant
in
[**2117**]. He has a history of ventricular tachycardia and has had 2
prior ablation procedures in the summer of [**2118**] after recurrent
ventricular tachycardia and multiple AICD shocks. He was also
started on Amiodarone in [**Month (only) 216**] following his ablations after
Sotalol was unsuccessful. He also has a history of atrial
fibrillation for 15 years and more recently atrial flutter. On
[**2118-11-30**], he underwent an unsuccessful atrial flutter ablation
and
had an electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus
rhythm, however he reverted back to atrial fibrillation again
1-2
days after his cardioversion.  He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2118-12-12**] at which time his EKG revealed left atrial tachycardia
with 3:1 conduction. In early [**2119-2-27**], the patient was
hospitalized at [**Hospital 3236**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital with what he describes
as HF. He underwent echocardiogram [**3-20**] which revealed increased
LA size and worsening mitral regurgitation.  He now presents for
cardiac catheterization and surgical evaluation

[**2119-3-22**] CARDIAC CATH
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had a 40% lesion.  The LAD, LCx, and RCA were without
any
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamic measurement revealed elevated
left and
right sided filling pressures.  The mean RA was moderately
elevated at
14 mmHg.  RVEDP was moderately elevated at 15 mmHg.  PCW mean
was
severely elevated at 25 mmHg.  There was moderate pulmonary
artery
hypertension with PA of 49/30 mmHg.  The cardiac index was
calculated
using the FICK equation and showed a severely reduced cardiac
index of
1.5 l/min/m2.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically significant coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
5. Reduced cardiac index.
.
[**2119-3-22**] EKG
Atrial flutter, average ventricular rate 82. Marked leftward
axis at
minus 58 degrees. Intraventricular conduction delay with a QRS
duration
of 168 milliseconds. There are marked ST-T wave changes in the
lateral
precordial leads and poor R wave progression in leads V1-V4.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2119-3-20**] the rate is faster and there are no
longer
ventricular premature beats. The previously described lateral ST
segment
depressions persist unchanged.

[**2119-3-22**] CXR
FINDINGS: There is massive cardiomegaly. An AICD is identified
in
appropriate position. There is no focal consolidation, effusion,
or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Massive cardiomegaly. Otherwise, no acute
cardiopulmonary
process.
.
[**2119-3-23**] ECHO
IMPRESSION: Posterior mitral leaflet prolapse associated with
eccentric [**3-30**]+ mitral regurgitation and a markedly dilated left
atrium. Spontaneous echo contrast in the descending thoracic
aorta suggestive of reduced forward stroke volume.
.
[**2119-3-23**] CAROTIDS
IMPRESSION: No significant carotid artery stenosis (less than
40% on the
right, and no stenosis on the left).

Intra-op Echo [**2119-3-28**]
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The coronary sinus is
dilated (diameter >15mm). Agitated saline was injected into the
right arm and returned to the SVC.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. LV systolic function
appears depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle.
4. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There was posterior leaflet prolapse(P2)
and restriction. The anterior leaflet also had some prolapse of
A3. The mitral annulus is dilated to 4.3 cm.
8. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
annulus is dilated to 4.9 cm.
9. There is a small pericardial effusion.
