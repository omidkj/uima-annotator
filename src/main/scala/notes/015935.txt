Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98305**] is a 75 year-old female with CAD s/p LAD stent,
diastolic CHF, h/o breast cancer s/p L mastectomy, and ongoing
evaluation for cystic neoplasm of pancreas who presents with
about two weeks of dyspnea, chills and productive cough. She has
also had orthopnea requiring her to sleep on two pillows last
night and reports increased PND. She has not had dependent
swelling. She reports chest pain (pleuritic vs. MSK) with deep
inspiration that she feels is connected to her recent complaint
of left shoulder, neck, and chest wall pain; this was evaluated
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Ortho as an outpatient and ascribed to
glenohumeral arthritis and outlet impingement syndrome. In the
past two days, she states her cough has become productive. She
thinks this is at times related to difficulty swallowing or
choking on food although she denies any globus sensation; she is
also unsure if the coughing sometimes causes difficulty
swallowing. Today, she developed a low grade fever and notes
that she actually has been experiencing night sweats for
"months."
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.2, P 93, BP 128/88, RR 16,
O2sat 100%, pain [**8-30**]. Pt breathing comfortably at rest and
speaking in full sentences. She was given ASA 81mg x 3 due to
initial concern for cardiac etiology. Labs notable for WBC 16.8
with 87.8 N but on bands. EKG was NSR at 89, low voltage.
Cardiac enzymes have been < assay. PA/lateral CXR showed a
markedly increased cardiac sillouette with bilateral L>R pleural
effusions and left atelectasis. A lateral decub CXR demonstrated
loculation. Cardiology was called for a bedside ultrasound to
evaluate for pericardial effusion; there was no evidence of
tamponade. Blood cultures were drawn. Pt was given levofloxain
750mg IV and later tylenol 1000mg for fever to 100.3. She is
being admitted for further workup of the cardiac and pleural
effusions. On transfer, vs: T 100.1, P 97, BP 109/81, RR 20,
O2sat 93 RA.
.
On the floor, pt complains mostly of pain involving her left
shoulder, neck, chest wall, and back. This is exacerbated by
deep breathing and is also positional. She has taken tylenol
without much efficacy and states a lidoderm patch is helpful.
She further says is not "allowed" to take NSAIDs. She is not
currently dyspneic at rest and is off O2.
.
Review of sytems:
No recent weight loss or gain. Orthostatic lightheadedness on
Sunday which improved by the next day without intervention -
none currently. Occasional headache and recent left ear pain
with hearing changes. No rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies
palpitations. Periodic nausea which led to finding of cystic
neoplasm in the uncinate process of the pancreas with negative
(limited) cytology but elevated CEA concerning for mucinous
neoplasm (IPMN vs. CMN); undergoing active surveillance as
outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**]. She also has noted a possible left
neck cyst and is to follow up with ENT. No anorexia. No
constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain; no recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Diffuse arthralgias or
myalgias chronically. Longstanding pruritis of extremities which
has increased recently.

Imaging:
Cardiac Echo:
-The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is
echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w organization. No right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen. There is sustained right atrial
collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early
tamponade.
-Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**1-26**]/201,
sustained right atrial collapse is now seen, consistent with
possible early tamponade physiology. The overall size of the
effusion is unchanged.

Chest CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small left pleural effusion has simple fluid characteristics
and does not demonstrate CT findings associated with empyema.
However, direct correlation with thoracentesis may be helpful to
better ascertain the etiology of the effusion if warranted
[**Date Range 10015**].
2. Pericardial fluid and pneumopericardium, the latter
reportedly related to recent drainage procedure.
3. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, right greater than left,
with near
complete collapse of right lower lobe.

Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1.  Pericardiocentesis was performed with needle entry from the
subxiphoid position.
2.  Subsequent removal of 640cc of pericardial fluid (all sent
for studies) and confirmation by bedside echocardiogram of
sucessful removal of fluid with appropriate catheter position.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pericardial tamponade with improvement of pericardial
pressure after
removeal of 640 cc fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 98305**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2145-1-27**] with symptoms
of dyspnea. Her hospital course by system is summarized below.

# Pericardial effusion: Etiology remains unclear but malignancy
on the differential.  Pt is undergoing work-up of mucinous
pancreatic neoplasm with elevated CEA (likely IPMN or MCN) as
well as presum
