Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo with COPD, morbid obesity, now p/w with COPD exacerbation,
likely triggered by URI.
.
# Hypoxia: admission exam c/w with COPD exacerbation. ABG with
PCO2 at baseline. No evidence of pulmonary infiltrate suggestive
of PNA. Trigger for COPD exacerbation could be recent URI, also
?influenza, although patient received vaccine. DFA neg. Low
probablity of PE. Patient's respiratory status improved with
ipratropium Q6h, albuterol Q2h prn, Q4h standing, prednisone,
azithromycin.
.
# Afib: with episodic RVR. Patient was transferred to the
cardiology service for rate control of atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response.  His rate controlling regimen was
changed to diltiazem 120mg po q6hrs and lopressor 125mg po tid.
The high dose of beta blocker did not worsen his breathing with
his COPD flare and in fact his breathing had improved likely due
to the effect of steroid / abx / bronchodilators he had been on.
 His outpatient EP fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and agreed with the rate
control choices, the patient should follow up with EP as an
outpatient. Rate controlled to a range of 90-110 on the
cardiology floor and patient was transferred back to medicine
service for further management of COPD flare.
.
# Recent fever: likely due to URI. Unlikely to be due to rectal
abscess. Cultures were negative. Fever resolved.
.
# Diabetes mellitus: Continued on metformin and insuline
regimen.
.
# Coagulopathy: on warfarin for atrial flutter, goal [**12-26**]; INR 5
on admission with no sign of bleeding, and warfarin was held.
His INR gradually decreased to 1.9 and warfarin was restarted.
.
# HTN: was continued on diltiazem and metoprolol. Lisinopril and
furosemide were initially held due to signs of dehydration but
were then restarted.
.
# FEN: Regular; Low sodium / Heart healthy, Diabetic/Consistent
Carbohydrate, replete lytes
