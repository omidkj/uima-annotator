Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath
Productive cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old female with PMH significant for multiple
drug resistant PNAs, asthma/COPD s/p multiple intubations on
2.5L of home O2, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart
failure, morbid obesity, OSA (not compliant with CPAP), aortic
stenosis with valve area of [**2-3**].2 cm2), atrial fibrillation off
Coumadin due to GI bleed, and HTN presenting with worsening
cough over the last 4 days, worsening shortness of breath, and
new greenish sputum production.  Per patient, up until then, she
was doing very well and was about to be discharged home.
However, she then developed cough that became productive
yesterday and SOB worsened yesterday as well.  No immediate sick
contact except a roommate's husband who has been coughing and
visiting frequently in the rehab.  She mentioned that her
temperature was recorded at 99.7 and her baseline usually runs
around 96.  She also says that she has had tremors that have
started yesterday as well.  She noticed mild tremor at rest and
also jerky movements when she moves her arm.

She mentioned that her baseline home O2 was around 3L prior to
her last admission.  She was discharged last time with around 3L
of O2, but at the rehab they adjusted it downward to 2L because
her CO2 was higher for concern of CO2 retention.  However, since
then, she has been feeling a little more SOB then normal.

In the ED, initial vs were: T=99.4, HR=90, BP=124/62, RR=20,
POx= 98% on 4L.  Per the ED her CXR showed new infiltrates
bilaterally and she was thought to have a PNA.  She was given
nebs and started on Levofloxacin and cefepime. Prior to leavinig
the ED her vitals were T=98, HR=92, BP=99/54, RR=25, POx=97% 4L
(on 2.5L at home)

On the floor, the patient endorses that these are her usual
symptoms when she gets a PNA.  What is new is her tremor (but
per patient, she had this one time in the past wher her blood
cell count was low).  She also reports mild gas pains in her
abdomen and a headache.  She did feel lightheaded at her rehab
when she got up to go to the bathroom.

Images:
[**2197-10-18**]
- CXR (portable): Since the prior examination, there is
increased opacification overlying the left lower lobe, likely a
combination of now a moderate-sized left pleural effusion and
atelectasis, though infection is not excluded.  There is
worsening right basilar likely atelectasis. There are increased
pulmonary interstitial markings compatible with interstitial
pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable,
with stable cardiomegaly. There is tortuosity of the thoracic
aorta.
IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema with moderate left and
small right pleural effusions and bibasilar opacification,
likely atelectasis, though pneumonia is not excluded.

[**2197-10-20**]
- CXR (portable): In comparison with the study of [**10-18**], there is
persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence
of elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Bilateral pleural
effusions with
