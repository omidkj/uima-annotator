History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 49 year old female with history of type 1 diabetes
mellitus status-post pancreas transplant in [**2157**], end-stage
renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, who was transferred from
[**Hospital6 302**] in [**Location (un) 8973**], MA last night for futher
management. She presented to [**Hospital3 **] on the morning of
[**2161-11-10**] with fever to 104, odynophagia, and difficulty
swallowing, as well as lethargy. Per report, she had had three
days of fever, malaise, and sore throat, and was unable to
swallow secondary to pain. As a result, she had not taken any of
her oral medications. She was treated with IV diflucan for
possible candidal esophagitis. She was transferred after IV
formulation of her medications was not available and since her
primary nephrologist is here at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Of note, she had recently been admitted at an outside hospital
for bleeding from her peritoneal dialysis site. She was treated
with levofloxacin and vancomycin at that time for concern over
peritonitis, however these were stopped as she was not felt to
have an infection. She had an elevated INR at that time. About 4
weeks ago, her immunosuppressive regimen was changed from Imuran
to rapamycin, and her prednisone has been reduced from 5mg to
2.5mg daily. During that hospitalization, she was treated with
Levofloxacin and Vancomycin empirically to cover a potential
peritoneal infection, but these were discontinued prior to
discharge as there was no evidence of peritonitis.
.
Of note, at the time of her recent admission to OSH she had a
tick behind her left ear.

Past Medical History:

Social History:

Family History:
NC

Pertinent Results:
CT torso [**11-11**]
1. Patchy ground-glass opacities are seen throughout the lung
fields
bilaterally. In addition, note is made of consolidation in the
left greater
than right lower lobes.
2. No evidence of abdominal or pelvic hematoma. No focal fluid
collection to
suggest an abscess.
3. The esophagus is fluid filled to the level of the thoracic
inlet. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
4. Note is made of intraperitoneal free fluid and air, most
likely secondary
to the patient's peritoneal dialysis.
5. Pancreatic transplant is not well evaluated due to the lack
of IV
contrast, adjacent small bowel loops and intraperitoneal fluid.

EGD [**11-10**]
Normal esophagus, vesicles on epiglottis.

Brief Hospital Course:
#49 yo F/ w/ Hx of pancreas transplant, ESRD on PD p/w fevers to
103 and odynophagia/trismus and pain on speech.
.
#Odynophagia/Fever:  Pt. was found to have vesicular lesions on
endoscopy. These were sampled for viral DFA but not enough
sample was collected to interpret. ID felt that these most
likely represented HSV lesions but could represent several
things and she was initially started on
acyclovir/vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin as it also appeared that
she had a concomittant PNA. She quickly defervesced and was
weaned down to acyclovir and levofloxacin and remained afebrile.
Her serology appeared negative for acute infection w/ HSV,
mycoplasma or VZV. Tularemia titers were pending at time of d/c.
Renal transplant felt that the vesicles may be due to rapamycin
as she had recently been started on this, rapamycin was
supratherapeutic on presentation. Rapamycin was d/c'd and she
was continued on her previous regimen of tacrolimus and
azathioprine. Her symptoms of odynophagia quickly resolved after
the first 2 days in the hospital and she was able to take POs
for several days before d/c.
.
#Pancreas transplant: Pt. had some elevated blood glucose
readings which were felt to be due to the change in dialysate
used while in the hospital. Her HbA1c was indicative of very
good glucose control, she had no abdominal pain and her
lipase/amylase were normal.
.
#ESRD: On PD, pt. did not agree w/ the inpt. regimen that she
was put on and was d/c'd to continue her cycler at home.
.
#PVD: Pt. on coumadin for PVD, has never had stent placed. Was
supratherapeutic on presentation, likely [**3-7**] to not eating
adequately. INR came down w/ PO nutrition.
.
#Respiratory failure: Pt. stopped breathing and became
bradycardic after administration of conscious sedation in the
EGD lab. She was transferred to MICU and given narcan drip. Her
mental status improved and she was transferred out to the floor
the next day.
