CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2175-5-17**] 9:56 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: F/u head bleed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old woman with AH/SDH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
F/u head bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: renal failure

CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST, DATED [**2175-5-17**]

HISTORY: 81-year-old female with known intracranial hemorrhage
after trauma; followup.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 5-mm axial tomographic sections were
obtained from the skull base through the vertex and viewed in
brain and bone window. Much of the study is significantly
degraded by patient motion artifact and several sections were
repeated.

FINDINGS: The study is compared with the examination obtained
approximately 17 hours earlier. Allowing for the
motion-degradation, there has been no significant change in the
bifrontal parenchymal hemorrhages, likely representing
hemorrhagic contusions. There is no interval increase in
adjacent edema, mass effect or associated shift of the midline
structures. Assessment of the small hemorrhagic focus in the
anterior aspect of the right middle cranial fossa is limited,
but this, too, is not grossly changed, and no new hemorrhagic
focus is identified. Again demonstrated are large right
occipital scalp subgaleal hematoma with underlying right
basiocciput fracture and fluid layering in the right sphenoid
sinus, with no definite sphenoid fracture seen.

IMPRESSION: Motion-limited study, with no significant change
since the admission examination obtained on the preceding day.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2175-5-16**] 4:45 PM

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: ? fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman s/p fall on coumadin
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? fx
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 82-year-old female with status post fall, on
Coumadin. Evaluate for fracture.

No prior studies for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast images of the cervical spine were
obtained. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were performed.

FINDINGS: On sagittal images, the base of the occiput to the T2
vertebra is clearly visualized. The prevertebral soft tissues
are unremarkable. There is slight grade 1 retrolisthesis of C4
on C5. A C4 inferior endplate deformity most likely represents a
Schmorl node, although inferior endplate fracture cannot be
definitively excluded. Moderately severe degenerative changes of
the cervical spine. Facet joint proliferative changes and
posterior osteophytes result in mild spinal canal narrowing,
most marked at C5/6. There are emphysematous changes of the
lungs with scarring of the right lung apex. MRI is better in the
evaluation of the thecal sac, but there are no gross thecal sac
abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:
1. Grade 1 retrolisthesis of C4 on C5. A C4 inferior endplate
deformity likely represents a Schmorl's node, although inferior
endplate fracture cannot be definitively excluded. Clinically
correlate.
2. Degenerative changes of the cervical spine.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW:
1. Right basiocciput fracture well seen in coronal reformatted
images; exits at the jugular foramen but spares the occipital
condyle, and atlanto- occipital relationship is maintained.
2. Moderately severe degenerative changes, particularly at the
C5/6 > C4/5, with moderate canal stenosis and slight indentation
of the thecal sac (and cord). Might be at risk for "central
cord" injury at these levels (with appropriate mechanism). b/l
neural foraminal narrowing at these levels.
3. Evidence of severe bullous emphysema, w/irreg, focal
pleuroparench thickening, R lung apex; a pleural-based mass is a
consideration.
4. D/W Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1022**] (Trauma [**Doctor First Name **]), 0915h, [**2175-5-17**].

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2175-5-16**] 4:45 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: ? bleeding
Field of view: 50 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman s/p fall on coumadin
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? bleeding
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 82-year-old female status post fall, on Coumadin.

Comparison to prior CT abdomen/pelvis of [**2169-4-7**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis
were obtained after the administration of IV Optiray contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images were also obtained.

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Heart and great vessels are
unremarkable. There are scattered mediastinal lymph nodes. A
pretracheal lymph node measures 1.2 cm. There is apical
scarring. A right upper lobe pulmonary nodule measures 4 mm.
There is bibasilar atelectasis. Incidental note is made of a
1-cm spiculated right breast opacity concerning for malignancy.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, pancreas, adrenal
glands, and left kidney are unremarkable. Right kidney
hydronephrosis and ureteral stent is seen. A right kidney
hypodensity likely represents a cyst, but cannot be further
characterized on this examination. The spleen is heterogeneous
likely secondary to the phase of filling. There is a small
gallstone. Again seen is a suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm
measuring 3.7 cm. This has decreased in size compared to the
prior examination and there is evidence of surgical
intervention. There are bilateral common iliac artery grafts
with partial thrombosis. No free fluid or free air within the
mesentery.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum is normal. There is
sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. A 1.5
x 1.0 cm cystic structure is seen within the uterus. There is a
moderate amount of high- attenuation fluid within the pelvis,
likely representing hematoma. Incidental note is made of left
internal iliac aneurysm.

OSSEOUS WINDOWS: Demonstrate a partially displaced sacral
fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. Partially displaced sacral fracture with adjacent presacral
pelvic hematoma.
2. Suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.7 x 3.2 cm,
decreased in size compared to the previous examination. There
are common iliac artery grafts with partial thrombosis.
3. Right-sided hydronephrosis with right ureteral stent.
4. Gallstone.
5. Spiculated opacity in the right breast concerning for
malignancy, for which mammogram is recommended.
6. Cystic density within the uterus, for which pelvic ultrasound
is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Neurosurgery and
Orthopedic surgery were consulted because of her injuries. Her
SAH was managed non operatively; she was loaded with Dilantin
and will continue for the next 4 weeks until follow up with Dr.
