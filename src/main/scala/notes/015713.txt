Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**]
Chief Complaint:
Non-responsiveness and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T tube placement and cholangiogram
EGD x 4


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 84 year old female with history of dementia,
hypertension, type two diabetes mellitus, bipolar disease who
presents with two weeks of declining social functioning and PO
intake, usually able to walk with walker and perform ADL. CT
scan at [**Hospital1 2025**] showed (-)CT and (-) troponins. Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**10-12**], tox screen (-), CEs (-), primary team managing BP meds
and psyche meds. Was being worked up on [**Wardname 836**] for renal failure
and balancing HTN meds, when found by NSG staff to be
'unresponsive' with no breathing or radial pulse for 20 seconds.
Code blue called, initial blood pressure 80/50 with improvement
in mentation to baseline. Two hours after event, noted to have
decreasing BPs to 60s with concurrent mental status changes.
Repeat BPs in trendelenburg resolved to 110 with return of
mentation. She was transferred to the MICU on [**2186-10-15**] for NSG
concern of hypotension.
.
In the MICU she had three more episodes. These were
characterized by unresponsiveness, lack of a radial pulse (no
femoral pulse was taken), and a post-ictal confusional state
most consistent with seizures. Her EKG during these episodes was
unremarkable, although she does have a baseline RBBB. Hence,
heart block was deemed unlikely. MICU team was suspicious of
seizure activity, given complete unresponsiveness to verbal and
tactile stimuli, then confusion and return to baseline after
episode. Further, given her diabetes and her labile blood
pressure, autonomic seizures were of particular concern. She was
worked up by multiple teams, including Neurology. Per neurology
a head CT was obtained which indicated atrophy w/ mild
microangiopathic changes. She was put on EEG monitoring to
capture seizure activity however she did not have an episode
during monitoring. Other considerations were her baseline
psyciatric disorder or medication regimen. She was seen by
Psychiatry who do not feel her episodes of hypotension are
entirely explained by her bipolar disorder. Finally nephrology
was consulted to evaluate a renal source of her labile BP and
possible source of hypotensive episodes. Nephrology determined
she did not have RAS by US and Captopril study and did not feel
that her labile BP was renal in origin. Ultimately, it was felt
that a polypharmacy of her BP and anti-psychotic medications
were responsible for these episodes. Her BP/ Psych med regimen
were tapered and she has been stable for 3 days. She was
transferred to [**Wardname **] [**2186-10-17**] for further workup of an anion gap
and elevated WBC prior to anticipated discharge to a rehab
facility.
.
Of note, recently hospitalized @QuincyMC for mania, had episode
of syncope; workup head CT, head MRI, neck MRA, carotid doppler
studies, EEG, CXR, and echocardiogram. Head MRI notable for
periventricular white matter changes suggesting small vessel
disease. TTE showed normal sized LV with hyperdynamic systolic
function and EF of 75%. EEG normal. MRA of neck showed 65-70%
stenosis of internal carotids bilaterally.

Radiographic Studies:
Chest AP (prelim) - Allowing for difference in technique,
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with mild
cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The
lungs are clear.
.
([**2186-10-13**]) ECG:  NSR, RBBB, LAFB, LVH. unchanged from prior
.
([**2186-10-16**]) EEG IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations for symptoms. Routine sampling and automated
detection programs recorded no epileptiform features or
electrographic seizures. There was some multifocal slowing
admixed to the waking background, but this would be assessed
better through routine EEG tracings. There were no areas of
fixed focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
.
([**2186-10-14**]) EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in
the waking and drowsy states due to intermittent brief bursts of
mixed frequency slowing seen in the temporal regions
bilaterally, independently and asynchronously. The findings
suggest underlying subcortical dysfunction in those regions. In
a patient of this age, vascular disease would be among the
common causes. In addition, there were brief bursts of
generalized mixed frequency slowing, more non-specific in
etiology. There were no clearly epileptiform features. No
electrographic seizures were noted.
