Radiology:

CT head - 1.  Moderate to large amount of edema, likely
cytotoxic, involving right  frontal and temporal lobes with
areas of high attenuation within the right  frontal sulci
representing either subarachnoid hemorrhage or cortical laminar
necrosis in the setting of ischemic disease. The overall
appearance is more suggestive of an MCA distribution infarct
rather than acute trauma. Amyloid angiopathy may also be
considered.  Recommend MRI with diffusion- weighted sequences
for better evaluation. 2.  Moderate mass effect with compression
of right lateral
ventricle and 7 mm of left [**Hospital1 **] sub falcine herniation.

ELBOW (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT  [**2107-3-29**] 2:15 PM
HUMERUS (AP & LAT) LEFT; ELBOW (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT
1. No definite acute fracture or dislocation in the left arm.
Soft tissue swelling, most prominent in the distal forearm,
wrist, and left hand.
2. Fracture at the IP joint, extending into the joint space, of
uncertain age. Clinical correlation recommended to determine
acuity of this finding.

CT C-spine: 1. No acute fracture or abnormal alignment of
cervical vertebral bodies identified. 2. Multilevel degenerative
changes with areas of foraminal narrowing as described above. 3.
Apical paraseptal emphysema.

Head CT [**2107-3-29**]: 1. Moderately large region of cytotoxic edema,
involving right frontal and temporal lobes with gyriform
high-attenuation foci along the right frontal sulci, likely
representing early cortical laminar necrosis in a subacute right
MCA territorial infarction. The overall appearance is more
suggestive of an ischemic rather than an acute traumatic event.
Amyloid angiopathy with subarachnoid hemorrhage is a more remote
consideration. Recommend MRI with diffusion- weighted and GRE
sequences for more definitive characterization.  2. Moderate
mass effect with compression of right lateral ventricle and 7 mm
of leftward subfalcine, but no uncal or transtentorial,
herniation.

PCXR: No definite congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
Follow-up PA and lateral chest radiographs are recommended if
clinically warranted.

Head CT [**2107-3-30**]: No change in the appearance of the brain with
no change in the amount of mass effect nor change in the area of
possible intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is no change in the
amount of mass effect or subfalcine herniation. There is no
uncal herniation.

Path [**2107-3-31**]: Muscle, left arm:  Necrotic skin and skeletal
muscle.
Unremarkable tendon.

ECHO [**2107-3-31**]: Echocardiographic windows very suboptimal. The left
atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Lef ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is grossly
normal (LVEF>70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Head CT [**2107-4-1**]: No significant interval change in right middle
cerebral artery hemorrhagic infarct as described above as well
as mass effect and leftward midline shift.

PCXR [**2107-4-2**]: New right effusion.

EKG [**2107-4-2**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
  Intervals Axes
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
108 0 88 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 71558**]5 -7

PCXR [**2107-4-4**]: No evidence of pneumonia. Bilateral effusions,
increasing on the left, and mild CHF.

CXR [**2107-4-4**]: Right IJ replacement.
Single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2107-4-4**] at 14:10 hours
and is compared with the prior examination performed
approximately two hours previously. No acute change is
demonstrated. The ET tube is approximately 5 cm above the
carina. The right-sided IJ line has its tip projecting over the
distal SVC. Increased opacity is seen in the right hemithorax
consistent with layering right pleural effusion. No large
pneumothorax is seen in this projection.





Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 69 yo male w/ PMHx sig for afib and HTN who presents
after being found down at cabin in [**State 1727**]. General exam shows
compartment syndrome of LUE. Neurological exam significant for
minimal verbal output and left sided hemiplegia without sensory
response. INR sub therapeutic. The patient likely had large
cardiac embolus secondary to afib occlude his proximal R MCA.
This resulted in his collapse and subsequent rhabdomyolysis and
ischemia of LUE. Pt to be taken to OR for fasciotomy and then
will transferred to the NeuroICU.

Post-operatively clot found in L brachial artery s/p
thrombectomy. After discussion w/ vascular surgery, likelihood
of additional clot in palmar arch likely. Heparin gtt initiated
with understanding that any change in neuro status heparin
should be shut off and immediate CT head should be obtained.
goal PTT 50.

[**Doctor First Name **]: Patient went to OR for fasciotomy and thrombectomy [**3-29**]
then again on [**3-31**] and [**4-2**] for debridement.  Plan was made on [**4-5**]
to proceed with amputation of the left arm.  However, family
declined further care.

Neuro: Patient admitted to Neuro ICU.  Head of bed was kept at
less than 30 degrees.  HOB < 30 degrees
- q 1hr neuro checks, cardiac telemetry
- SBP < 185 and DBP < 105 and keep MAP > 65
- normothermia, normoglycemia
- if change in exam, get stat head CT and consult Nsurg given
possible ICH
- wean sedation when possible
- pain control

Cardiac:
- rate control
- Dc'd heparin IV [**3-31**] and started on coumadin [**3-30**]
- ruled out MI
- 2D ECHO poor study ~70% EF and does not comment on wall motion
abnormality or possible clot

Pulm:
- will discuss w/family ?trach/peg

Renal:
- IVF for Rhabdomyolysis
- follow Cr downtrending

PPX:
- colace/IV PPI
