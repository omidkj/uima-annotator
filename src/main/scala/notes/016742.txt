History of Present Illness:
79 yo F with severe 3VD, CAD s/p CABG two weeks ago who was at
the TCU at [**Hospital3 1280**] doing well when she developed [**11-22**]
sub-sternal chest pain.  EKG done there revealed ST elevations
in V1-V3.  She had been recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**1-6**] with chest pain which occurred following vomiting
coffee ground material.  She underwent a cardiac catheterization
which showed 40-50 percent left main, proximal LAD, diagonal,
circumflex, OM and PDA stenosis.  She had some large hemoptysis
prior to CABG, she underwent an upper GI endoscopy which showed
no active bleeding and she was cleared for surgery.  She
underwent CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the diag, saphenous vein graft
to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to the ramus, saphenous vein
graft to the OM, and saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
Cardiac catheterization here showed T/O SVG-LAD, SVG-RDA,
SVT-RAMUS, 80% stenosis at touch down.  Was stented X2 in native
LAD.  Transferred to CCU with plan to eventually stent ramus and
pda.

Cardiac Catheterizations:
[**2112-1-23**]
1. Severe three vessel disease of the native coronary arteries
with
graft occlusion of the SVG-LAD and SVG-PDA with touchdown
stenosis of
the SVG-Ramus.
2. Elevated right sided filling pressures.
3. Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. PCI of the upper pole distal LAD.
5. Acute myocardial infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD - 79 year old female with CAD s/p recent CABG presenting
with chest pain, inferior STEMI, found to have two T/O vein
grafts and one 80% stenosis at the touchdown of her SVG-Ramus.
She was transferred here for emergent catheterization and her
native LAD was stented.  Post intervention she was having severe
nausea and was admitted to the CCU for further monitoring and
care.  She did well post catheterization.  She had no events and
was transferred from the CCU to the floor.  Her ASA, Plavix,
Lipitor, beta-blocker and ACE-I were continued.  She was taken
back to the catheterizion lab for intervention on her SVG-PDA.
A stent was placed in her native PDA.  She did well after her
second catheterization.  She was discharged on ASA,
Beta-blocker, ACE-I, and Plavix for 12 months.
.
2. pump- On presentation to the CCU she was felt to be fluid
overloaded by exam.  She was treated with IV Lasix.  A repeat
Echo was performed which showed: "Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded (post-op septal
motion). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen."  On discharge
her lungs were clear and she was no longer felt to be fluid
overloaded.
.
3. GI- She had presented on her last admission with GI bleed.
During this admission she was closely monitored and had no
further bleeding.  Her HCT remained stable, she had no guiaic
positive stools.  She was maintained on Protonix 40 PO BID.
.
4. Hypothyroidism - During this hospitalization she was
continued on Levoxyl.
.
5. Asthma - She was continued on Singulair and flovent inh
during this hospitalization.

6. Mild renal insufficiency - After her first catheterization
she had a slight increase in her creatinine.  She was well
hydrated prior to her second catheterization and given mucomyst
[**Hospital1 **] for 4 dosages.

7. Shoulder pain - She was evaluated by Rheumatology for her
shoulder pain.  It was felt that she would benefit from
out-patient rheumatology.
