Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2197-1-6**]
1. Mitral valve replacement with a 33-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic mitral
valve bioprosthesis, serial #[**Serial Number 109338**], reference #[**Serial Number 109339**].
2. Tricuspid valve repair with an [**Doctor Last Name **] 32-mm MC cubed ring,
serial #[**Serial Number 109340**], model #4900.
3. Coronary bypass grafting x1 with a reverse saphenous vein
graft from aorta to the posterior descending coronary artery.
4. Atrial septal defect repair with bovine pericardium.

History of Present Illness:
Delightful 79 year old gentleman with a history of mitral valve
regurgitation diagnosed in [**2192**] and followed by serial
echocardiograms. Over the past year, he has been admitted to the
hospital 6 times for congestive heart failure and has also
required a continuous infusion of lasix. He is now taking
torsemide 100mg daily. In addition he goes to infusion clinic
for IV diuresis. Because of his chronic myelogenous leukemia,
advanced chronic kidney disease and low EF, he has been
considered a poor surgical candidate for corrective intervention
on the mitral valve. However, because of repetitive
hospitalizations over the past year, it is felt to be time to
consider a high-risk corrective surgery.

Pertinent Results:
[**2197-1-6**] Echo: PREBYPASS: A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A secundum type atrial
septal defect of approximately 8mm is present. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with dyskinesis of the basal inferior wall,
severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferolateral wall and
inferoseptal walls and mild hypokinesis of the anterior,
anterolateral and anteroseptal walls. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posterior directed
jet of The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. An epiaortic scan showed
and anterior rim of calcification and the canulation and cross
clamp site were adjusted accordingly.
POSTBYPASS: The patient is receiving epinephrine at 0.05
ucg/kg/min. LV systolic function appears marginally improved in
the setting of inotropes (LVEF25-30%). RV systolic function is
improveed. The is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis
in the mitral position. There is trace valvular MR. There is a
ring prosthesis in the tricuspid position. There is trace
valvular TR. The ASD is no longer visualized. An agitated saline
bubble study revealed no intraatrial shunt at rest of with
Valsalva and release. The study is otherwise unchanged from
prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 79-year-old gentleman referred by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] for recalcitrant
heart failure. Workup demonstrated severe mitral regurgitation,
as well as moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and
single-vessel coronary disease. The patient was admitted to the
hospital and brought to the operating room on [**2197-1-6**] where he
patient underwent mitral valve replacement with a 33-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
Epic mitral valve bioprosthesis, tricuspid valve repair with an
[**Doctor Last Name **] 32-mm MC cubed ring, coronary bypass grafting x1 with a
reverse saphenous vein graft from aorta to the posterior
descending coronary artery and atrial septal defect repair with
bovine pericardium. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.   POD 1 found
the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably. Electrophysiology interrogated the permanent
pacemaker post operative day 1.  The patient was neurologically
intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor
support. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The renal
service was consulted for post operative ATN (baseline creatine
is 3.0). Peak creatine was 4.4 and peak BUN 117. Diuretics were
decreased per renal recommendations and he was maintained on
Lasix 40 IV daily.  Per renal recommendations, he is to stay on
Lasix 40 IV BID until edema decreases and then go to Lasix 40 IV
daily with renal follow up in 6 weeks.  This appointment has
been arranged.  He was anticoagulated for post operative atrial
fibrillation and a history of CVA due to LV thrombus.  His
Coumadin was held POD 9, as the patient had epistaxis.  Dr [**First Name (STitle) 437**]
was contact[**Name (NI) **] and he recommended continuing the Coumadin once
discharged with INR goal 2-2.5 (epistaxis had resolved
