Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
62 YO M with pmhx of CAD s/p CABG, tracheomalacia, CHF, HTN
underwent OP bronchoscopy with BAL today for tracheomalacia
evaluation , and developed progressive chills, neck stiffness,
shortness of breath later in the day while at radiology for a
routine scheduled CT scan for tracheomalacia (no contrast).  His
VS were stable except for hypoxia of 89% on a NRB, he was
administered 1 amp d50 and transferred to the ED.
.
In ED, initial VS T99 HR 95 165/53 26 95% on 15L proBNP: 2864,
lactate 2.1  given, albuterol levo, flagyl, and vanco, lasix
with 800cc output. Was 97.1. 73 154/77 97% on 4L on admission
request to ICU.
.
Of note, he has recently had 2 episodes of PNA in [**8-25**] and
[**10-25**], which required inpatient therapy at [**Hospital3 **] with
antibiotics but no intubation. He has been on 6 weeks of
antibiotics most recently for PNA with productive cough,
initially with levaquin, then 2 cycles of amoxicillin, although
records suggest Bactrim, finished yesterday.  He has also noted
increased DOE over the past few weeks, also associated with
increased swelling in the legs bilaterally, and wt gain of 20lbs
since [**Month (only) **], no clear affirmation of dietary indiscretion.
This required increasing use of his baseline 2L oxygen at night
with CPAP to use during the day.
.
MICU course:
[**12-28**]: admitted, resumed diet, goal I/O even, started steroids,
call out
echo, start prednisone 40 qday x 5days

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Mildly depressed LVEF. TDI
E/e' >15,
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal
inferolateral - akinetic; mid inferolateral - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.


Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with thinned
and akinetic
inferolateral wall. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There may be right ventricular
hypertrophy. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is
at least moderate pulmonary hypertension. There is a partially
echo dense
pericardial region (particularly posterior to the left
ventricle) consistent
with a small somewhat organized pericardial effusion . There is
no
echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.



Final Report
CT TRACHEA, [**2186-12-27**]

COMPARISON:  CT trachea [**2186-11-8**].

INDICATION:  Tracheobronchomalacia.

Multidetector CT of the chest was performed using the CT trachea
protocol,
which includes a standard-dose end inspiratory CT of the chest
followed by
[**Last Name (un) **]-dose dynamic expiratory CT of the chest to assess for
tracheomalacia.

At end inspiration, there is no evidence of fixed tracheal or
bronchial
stenosis, and there are no suspicious endoluminal lesions.

During dynamic expiration, there is severe diffuse
tracheobronchomalacia,
involving the entirety of the intrathoracic trachea and
extending into the
main, proximal lobar, and segmental bronchi.  There is
near-complete collapse
at the level of the trachea, main bronchi, and lower lobe
subsegmental
bronchi.  Multifocal air trapping is present, a finding that
frequently
accompanies tracheobronchomalacia.

As compared to the previous scan, the degree of airway malacia
is similar, but
the prior scan did not evaluate the distal airways due to
differences in
images acquisition.

Within the lungs, there are new multifocal areas of
consolidation and ground
glass attenuation, which involve all lobes of both lungs and are
accompanied
by peribronchiolar nodular opacities.  However, the dependent
portions of the
lower lobes and the right middle lobe are most severely
affected.  Previously
reported poorly defined opacity adjacent to the right
hemidiaphragm is
difficult to compare due to coexisting adjacent new areas of
consolidation.
Previously present scattered peribronchiolar opacities are
difficult to
compare due to the new diffuse areas of abnormality, but some of
these have
resolved in the interval.

Within the imaged portion of the neck, a small air collection
lateral to the
airway in the region of the thyroid cartilage was present
previously but
incompletely imaged due to differences in acquisition areas
between the two
studies.  Thi
