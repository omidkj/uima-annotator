Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1674**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right lung thoracentesis, exudative, 2.2 liters removed
Femoral line placement
External jugular line placement
CT scan of torso


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 34631**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of DM,
osteoporosis, CAD s/p PTCA of LAD, and R pleural effusion seen
on US done [**7-1**] who was brought to the ED from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab due
to progressive dyspnea.  Over the past 7 days the patient had
been complaining of dyspnea on exertion.  At baseline she
ambulates with a walker however recently she has been more
fatigued as has required 2L O2 to keep sats above 90%.  She has
increasing edema in her LE bilaterally over the same period of
time.  Her nurse also noted poor PO intake.  She was also noted
to be in atrial fibrillation which is new for her and was
started on coumadin on [**7-2**].  At that time, zocor and zestril
were discontinued.  Reportedly a CXR was done at rehab which
showed unilateral pleural effusion, abdominal US done showed
pericardial effusion.  However, echocardiogram done on [**7-2**] did
not show pericardial effusion but showed 4+ TR, LVEF 35-40%, 1+
MR, 1+ AR.

In the ED, vital signs are BP 180/100, HR 70, RR 22, O2sat 100%
on NRB.  She was immediately placed on CPAP and started on nitro
gtt.  Labs were notable for WBC count 10.9, neut 85%, hct 52,
INR 4.5, normal lactate.  CXR showed moderate opacification of
the entire right hemithorax likely related to both a
moderate-to-large sized right-sided pleural effusion and
reactive atelectasis.  Some areas of right lung still
identified.  The left lung appears clear.  While in the ED the
BP improved to systolic 160 on the nitro gtt.  Oxygen saturation
was 100% on CPAP and she was switched to a nonrebreather.  She
was given a dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin as well as one
dose of Vitamin K.  IP was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding tapping the
effusion.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is accompanied by her
daughter.  She says her breathing is improved from when she came
in to the hospital.  She denies chest pain, fevers, chills,
abdominal pain.  She denies any night sweats or recent weight
loss.  She has a mild nonproductive cough.  Her daughter notes
that she has not had LE edema in the past.


Past Medical History:

infarction in [**2186**], status post percutaneous transluminal

Pertinent Results:
[**7-2**] Echo:
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery
disease. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**7-4**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate opacification of the entire right
hemithorax likely related to both a moderate-to-large sized
right-sided pleural effusion and reactive atelectasis. Some
areas of right lung still identified. The left lung appears
clear.

EKG atrial fibrillation at 99 bpm, leftward axis, nl intervals,
Q waves in III, aVF, V1-V3TWI I, aVL, ? STD V6.  Compared to EKG
dated [**2192-4-1**] unchanged.

PORTABLE CHEST, [**2199-7-5**]
COMPARISON: Previous study of earlier the same date.
INDICATION: Status post thoracentesis.
Right pleural effusion has markedly decreased in size. Small
residual pleural effusion following thoracentesis. No definite
pneumothorax is identified, but the most peripheral aspect of
the minor fissure is not well visualized. The possibility of a
very small lateral pneumothorax is thus not excluded. Left
hemidiaphragm appears poorly defined, possibly due to motion
artifact, but a small pleural effusion is also possible.

LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND
HISTORY: Bilateral lower extremity edema.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed
of the
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal
veins. Within
the left lower extremity, the distal portion of the left
superficial femoral vein did not completely compress. There also
was minimal flow seen through the segment of the left distal
superficial femoral vein. There is normal compressibility, flow
and augmentation of the right lower extremity. There is normal
compressibility and flow of the left popliteal vein, proximal
and mid superficial femoral vein and the left common femoral
vein.

IMPRESSION: Likely chronic non-occlusive small thrombus
localized to the
distal portion of the left superficial femoral vein. These
findings were
discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time of review.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**7-6**] Upper extremity ultrasound:

IMPRESSION: 1. DVT within one of the branches of the left
brachial vein and completely clotted left basilic vein. The left
cephalic vein was not visualized.

[**7-8**] CT Torso:
COMPARISON: CT torso, [**2192-8-14**].

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are no pathologically enlarged
axillary lymph nodes. Scattered calcifications associated with
hypoattenuation foci in the thyroid do not appear significantly
changed. The heart is normal in size, and there is no
significant pericardial effusion. Atherosclerotic
calcification of the coronary arteries and the thoracic aorta is
observed. A precarinal lymph node measures 16 x 10 mm,
previously 14 x 12 mm.

There has been significant increase in size of a now large right
pleural
effusion and development of a new small left pleural effusion.
The nodular
soft tissue density along the periphery of the right lower lobe
fissure seen in [**2192**] is less conspicuous today. No new lung
nodules are identified today.  The airways appear patent to the
subsegmental level bilaterally. A few subcentimeter
hypoattenuating right hepatic lesions (2:58 and 52) are too
small to characterize and not definitively identified on prior
studies. The gallbladder is mildly distended and contains
multiple g
