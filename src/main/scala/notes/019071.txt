Admission Date:  [**2155-7-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2155-9-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2107-11-15**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47-year-old male with
past medical history significant for morbid obesity, diabetes
mellitus, prostate cancer status post a radical prostatectomy
with perineal approach performed [**2154-11-27**], who was admitted
from an outside hospital for persistent shortness of breath
and increased oxygen requirements.  Since his surgery in
[**Month (only) 1096**] he has noted periods of progressive dyspnea.  His
postsurgical course was complicated by multiple wound
infections.  The patient's initial complaints included
dyspnea, orthopnea, and a sense of chest discomfort.  The
patient has also been having low-grade fevers.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Prostate cancer status post surgery
on [**2154-11-27**].  This was a [**Doctor Last Name **] six adenocarcinoma with
negative margins.  Postsurgical course was complicated by
wound infections from perineal approach.  2. Morbid obesity.
3. Questionable history of a bacterial Enterococcal
endocarditis.  4. Hypercholesterolemia.  5. Hypertension.  6.
Diabetes type 2.  7. Depression/anxiety.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  This gentleman is married with two children,
formerly worked in a scrap metal company.  He quit smoking
about five years ago, but prior had a five-pack-a-day history
for 8-10 years.  He denied alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes and hypertension in
his mother.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial presentation he was a
fatigued, obese male speaking in short bursts of sentences.
He was on a Venti mask in order to breathe.  He was noted to
be using his accessory muscles.  Initial vital signs were
96.4 temperature, blood pressure 144/66, respiratory rate 30,
heart rate 100 and 100% on 15 liter Venti mask.  He was
normocephalic, atraumatic, with supple neck.  It was
difficult to appreciate any jugular venous distension
secondary to body habitus.  He was regular rate and rhythm
with S1 and S2 noted.  No murmurs were noted but his heart
sounds were distant, again secondary to habitus.  He was
noted to be tachypneic with decreased breath sounds at the
bases.  He had a soft obese belly with positive bowel sounds.
He was noted to have 2+ pitting edema to the knees.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission he had a 9.8 white count.  His
EKG showed only sinus tachycardia with some flattening of T
waves but no sign of acute ischemia.  His arterial blood gas
was 7.45, 47, and 118.  Records from the outside hospital
indicate that he had received lower extremity Dopplers on
[**2155-7-1**], which were negative for DVT.  His chest x-ray
showed some cardiomegaly and some question of increased
pulmonary vascular congestion.  He had a VQ scan done earlier
on [**2155-6-15**] that showed low probability of embolic disease.

He was admitted for progressive shortness of breath which, at
the time, was of unclear etiology.  It was thought it might
have been secondary to congestive heart failure, pneumonia,
pulmonary embolism or other source.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Cardiovascular: Echocardiogram showed
evidence of endocarditis, including a vegetation seen on the
right cusp of the aortic valve.  It was also noted that he had 4+
mitral regurgitation and 3+ aortic insufficiency.  This was
presumed to be secondary to his enterococcal bacteremia and
represent enterococcal endocarditis. He was on ampicillin at the
time. CT surgery as well as cardiology were consulted.  He had a
catheterization done on [**2155-7-23**] that showed clean coronaries
and an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of
45.  The subsequent plan made was for bivalvular replacement.
The conditions for surgery initially were for him to remain
afebrile with negative cultures for 48 hours.  In the
meantime, he was started on low-dose captopril 6.25 t.i.d. to
reduce afterload to improve cardiac function.  On initially
starting captopril, he dropped his pressures and required
pressors.  Surgical planning was complicated by the patient
running persistent fevers and running positive blood
cultures.  Captopril was restarted on [**2155-8-22**] and this time
tolerated by the patient with adequate pressures.

On [**2155-8-23**] an EKG showed T wave inversions that were new
compared with the [**2155-8-4**] comparison, across the precordium.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled which showed a troponin of 0.13
and a CK of 100.  The elevation of cardiac enzymes prompted a
reconsult of cardiology, who felt that the findings were
consistent with flipped emboli given the previously negative
catheterization.  Repeat checks of enzymes showed the CK
maintained between 92 and 100 and the troponin did not
elevate, it stayed at 0.10 for the subsequent two cycles of
enzymes.  The patient was started on aspirin, a beta blocker,
and was maintained on the ACE inhibitor.  Also, attempts at
diuresis with combinations of Lasix and Diuril were used to
attempt to keep the patient slightly negative.

The patient continued to be febrile throughout most of his
course in the intensive care unit.  CT surgery's criteria for
surgery were clearing of his decubitus ulcers and for the
patient to become more awake and alert, and improve physical
stamina.  Therefore, they decided it would be best if he went
to a rehabilitation unit once he was stable.

The patient has now been afebrile for four days.  CT surgery
has been contact[**Name (NI) **] periodically to update them on his
condition.  At the present time they still feel he is a poor
surgical risk and have recommended that he go to
rehabilitation prior to surgery.

2. Infectious disease:  The patient has known enterococcal
endocarditis with visualized vegetation on TEE on the valve
of the aorta.  The patient has also had a history of
bacteremia while in the unit.  He has had panresistant
Klebsiella, positive bacteremia, as well as periodic
coagulase-negative staphylococcus bacteremia.  He has been
followed closely by infectious disease over the seven weeks
that he has been in the unit and has had multiple antibiotic
switches.  He was on ampicillin, gentamicin, and ceftazidime
for much of [**Month (only) 216**].  He had CT scan of head, chest,
abdomen, and pelvis on [**2155-8-8**] that showed only his
pulmonary infiltrates and no sign of other embolic disease.
He had a brief bump in his creatinine to 1.4 while on
gentamicin and since it was being used for synergy, it was
discontinued after a two-week course.  Subsequently the
creatinine returned to [**Location 213**].  He was placed on imipenem and
Cipro for 21 days for his Pseudomonas in the sputum, of which he
is about day 19 of 21, and completed a week's worth of
vancomycin for the coagulase-negative staphylococcus.  He had
a PICC line placed and all other lines were removed in an
attempt to remove potential sources for infection.  He has
currently been afebrile for the past four days.

3. Respiratory:  The patient initially came in very short of
breath and tiring, requiring 15 liter Venti mask.  He was
electively intubated to facilitate studies including CT Scan and
echo to evaluate his orthopnea and respiratory distress. Due to
his peristent bacteremia and continued CHF related to his
valvular disease he remained intubated and required a
tracheostomy on [**2155-8-16**].  For the last several days
he has been on a tracheostomy collar doing very well without
the ventilatory support.

4. Neurologic:  The patient's sedation and pain medication
regimens have been lightened over the past several weeks in
an attempt to wake him up.  As the patient became more alert,
it became concerning that he was not moving his right arm
very effectively.  Repeat CT scan showed no events to
indicate embolism or stroke.  In the last several days the
patient has been visualized using that right hand, but to a
lesser extend than the left.  He will need physical therapy
as well as monitoring of his neurological status as he
becomes more alert.

5. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition/GI:  The patient is on
continuous tube feeds via a PEG.  He required insulin drips
for some parts of his int
