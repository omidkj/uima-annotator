Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
aphasia and R-sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p tPA at OSH
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52592**] is a 63yo woman with a complex PMHx
including recently diagnosed metastatic lung adenocarnioma,
takotsubo cardiomyopathy complicated by MI x3, DM, HTN, COPD,
and
HL who presents today with acute onset aphasia and and right
sided weakness s/p tPa.  She had been in her USOH until two days
ago, when her husband reports that she has been increasingly
sleepy, noting that she awakes to eat and take her pain
medications, but otherwise has been more somnolent than usual.
However, she was appropriate and moving all four extremities
well, with no change in speech.  No apparent complaints about
HA.
Of note, she was recently started on palliative chemotherapy
with
carboplatin and pemetrexed for her metastatic lung cancer with
mets to her left femur, which she has been medicating with
around
the clock oxycontin and oxycodone.  She was just at an
orthopedics f/u appointment on the day prior to presentation,
during which she was noted to be very fatigued-appearing.
     On the day of admission, she was tired but otherwise at her
baseline per her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] gave her oxycontin/oxycodone at
1:30pm and she took a nap.  She awoke at 3pm and her husband
helped her to the bathroom.  At that time, she was noted to have
normal gait and was speaking normally.  She then went back to
sleep.  At approximately 4:30pm, her husband noted that she woke
up and was unable to speak.  She sates that it looked as though
her mouth was "stuck closed".  He believes that her face was
drooping, but wasn't sure.  Noted that she had weakness on her
right side, but was looking around with apparent full EOM.
However, concerned about a stroke, he carried her to his car and
drove him to the local OSH for urgent evaluation (drove because
he lives minutes away from the hospital).
     There, the ED was concerned about a stroke given her
symptoms.  Her NIHSS was scored at approximately 22.  A NCHCT
revealed that she had a ?clot in the L MCA.  She was given tPa
approximately 4hrs and 20 minutes after her last seen well time
(~7:20pm).  Her husband states that while she wasn't talking or
following commands in the ED, he states that her children
thought
that she was doing better and that she was looking at them.
Prior to transport, she fell asleep.  She was then brought to
the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for consideration of urgent neurointervention.  With
that in mind, a code stroke was called and neurology was
urgently
invited to consult.


Past Medical History:
-- metastatic lung adenocarcinoma -- diagnosed in [**7-/2136**] after
she had left thigh pain and suspicious lytic lesions of her left
femur were found.  CT torso revealed nodules.  bx of femur
lesions in [**8-/2136**] confirmed diagnosis.  She recently started
chemo (carboplatin and pemetrexed) five days prior to
presentation.  Left femur s/p ORIF in [**7-/2136**] [**12-28**] concern for
impending fracture.  Repeat imaging of femur on [**10-8**] showed no
fracture or any acute changes of femur
-- Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and s/p MI x3 -- recently (first at
age 58, clean cath at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital; second on [**2136-5-21**]
and third on [**2136-5-23**], again admitted to [**Hospital3 417**],
ultimately diagnosed with "broken heart syndrome", f/b

IMAGING:
CT HEAD [**2136-10-9**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. No acute large territorial infarction. Recommend MRI for
increased
sensitivity for detection.

ECHO [**2136-10-10**]:
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No echocardiographic
evidence
