Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
51 yo man with no significant past medical history presenting
with bilateral lower extremity edema that has worsened gradually
over the past two months and  significantly worsened over the
past couple of days. He also reports a 7 lb weight gain since
wednesday, [**12-6**].

He had been in his usual state of health until sometime over the
summer when he began to experience bilateral calf pain that was
associated with a predictable interval of exertion and relieved
by rest. He also associated this with some mild shortness of
breath but he felt that this may have been related to the pain.
He gradually began to feel this pain with walking shorter
distances. It was always releived by rest.

He began to notice the LE edema several months ago. He also
endorsed a history of progressive dyspnea on exertion. He has a
difficult time identifying the time course of this, but it seems
that it may date back several months to one year ago. He
described feeling more out of breath when climbing a flight of
stairs and also when his claves hurt. He also said that when he
would have to rest for his calves, he would breath heavily
because he felt that this would decrease the pain.

He currently denies difficulty breathing but does say that he
feels  a sense of have congestion in his lungs or "something I
need to cough out."

He has not had any recent illnesses other than a flu-like
illness that lasted 2 days about one month ago.

He denies orthopnea, PND, chest pain or pressure.

Past Medical History:
None except MVA in [**2130**]

Social History:
Currently smokes half a pack daily. Smoked over a pack daily for
about 20 years. Drinks several days for week. Only beer. The
most he will drink is 6 when watching a game, but usually just
2. Works in property management. Lives by himself. Divorced 10
years ago.

Says his father had "blockage" and a stent in his 60s

PT: 14.0  PTT: 27.1  INR: 1.2

ECG: NSR with LAD, LVH, also interventicular conduction delay

ECHO [**12-8**]:
IMPRESSION: Dilated LV with severe regional LV systolic
dysfunction consistent with multivessel CAD or other diffuse
process. Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures.
Critical aortic stenosis with at lleast moderate aortic
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


ECHO [**12-12**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 25%) with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis and
hypokinesis elsewhere. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderately to severely
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area ~1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-12-8**],
ventricular systolic function appears similar. Heart rate is now
lower. Estimated aortic valve area is now larger, probably due
to increase in stroke volume.
Estimated pulmonary artery pressure is now lower.

Coronary Cath [**12-10**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
left dominant system revealed
moderate two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had a 60-70% stenosis
at the
mid vessel. The Lcx had a 30% proximal stenosis and a 60%
mid-vessel
stenosis. The RCA was nondominant and had no angiographically
apparent
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right and
left sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 22 mmHg and LVEDP of 41 mmHg.
There
was severe pulmonary hypertension with a PASP of 70 mmHg. There
was a
depressed cardiac index of 1.4 L/min/m2. There was critical
aortic
stenosis with a valve area of 0.5 cm2. and a mean gradient of 30
mmHg.
The central aortic pressure was normal at 120/83 mmHg.
3. Peripheral angiography revealed severe PVD with occluded
right iliac
artery (Dottered by sheath) and bilateral origin SFA occlusion
(though
right side worse than left). An angled glide wire was required
for
access in addition to a long sheath.

CT Torso:
1. Calcifications of the aorta, predominantly at the arch and
involving the infrarenal aorta. Dense calcifications of the
aortic valve and coronary arteries.
2. 1.9-cm right common iliac artery aneurysm.
3. Pulmonary interlobular septal thickening and bilateral
pleural effusions consistent with pulmonary edema.
4. Small to moderate amount of ascites.
5. Cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 year old man with no known past medical history who presents
with congestive heart failure and critical aortic stenosis.

1. Acute  on chronic systolic CHF/ Aortic Valve Stenosis: Pt was
found to have significant heart failure with EF of 25%.  Given
his cath results (see above), this is thought to due to a
combination of ischemic and alcohol cardiomyopathy.
Catheterization also showed extensive peripheral vascular
disease.  There was significant concern over pt's severely
narrow valvular size O.5cm.  Dobutamine was not given during
cath given his low output state.  Repeat ECHO done as a
presurgical study which showed an improved cardiac output and
larger valve area.  There was great discussion about the
necessity of urgent valve stenosis.  After much input from
several physicians from the cardiology and cardiac surgery
teams, it was decided to complete valve repair with simultaneous
CABG as outpatient.

He was started on AceI, BB, Statin, and Lasix.  He was also
started on fish oil.  In anticipation of his surgery,
dental/oral surgery were consulted.  Pt received tooth
extraction as prophylaxis prior to valve repair.

2. PAD/claudication: ABI was measured by PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 10755**] and was
0.6. He has a strong family history of hyperlipidemia.  LDL 102.
 Total Cholesterol 144.  Claudication is probably worsened by
poor forward flow given his aortic stenosis.  Will treat aortic
stenosis and PVD should be ressessed and treated as outpt.
