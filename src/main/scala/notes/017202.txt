Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from the OSH following tonic/clonic seizure after
found to have subdural hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mechanical ventilation, bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
66 yr old female with complicated PMH including h/o follicular
lymphoma s/p BMT in [**2168**], DM, MRSA septicemia (per records),
chronic thrombocytopenia (baseline plt count around 30) with
frequent recurrent pneumonias in the last ? BOOP but never had a
biopsy, who was innitially admitted to the OSH for presumed PNA
with symptoms of right sided pleuritic chest pain of several
days duration. WBC 20.9 on admission, afebrile. CXR with right >
left pleural effusion. The patient was r/o for PE with chest
CTA. The patient was also hyponatremic with Na of 127. The
patient was treated with Doxycycline and Rocephin (then changed
to Ivanz). Then on HD #7 developed tonic-clonic seizure. Head CT
was subsequently done and revealed left chronic subdural
hematoma with 5 mm left to right shift. The patient was loaded
with dilantin and then transferred to the BIBMC for further
management of her subdural hematoma. Labs from OSH on the day of
transfer Na 128, Ca 5.3 (alb 2.2), Mg 1.2.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was admitted to the neurosurgery
service. The patient declined to undergo evacuation of her
subdural hematoma. She had had no further seiuzure activity. She
developed respiratory distress RR in 30-40's with new increased
oxygen requirements (requiring 50-70% VM). The patient is now
being transferred to the medicine service.

ROS is negative for f/c, cough, hemoptysis, abd pain, change in
bowel, bladder habits. The patient's husband related [**Name2 (NI) 39939**] in
patient's gait from normal to shuffling, small steps for about 2
months prior to admission. She also fell back in [**Month (only) 205**] in
bathroom hitting her head. She has not had any falls since that
time.

Head CT: Moderate to left chronic left subdural hematoma with
mild mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere, with no
appreciable shift of the midline structures. The maximum width
of SDH is 16mm. No acute intracranial hemorrhage seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yr old female with complicated PMH including follicular
lymphoma s/p BMT, BOOP?/recurrent pneumonias, chronic
thrombocytopenia admitted with PNA and found to have subdural
hematoma.

1. Pulmonary opacities/ pleural effusions - PNA vs. BOOP (no
biopsy or bronchospcopy in the past), effusion differential was
broad with h/o malignancy, pneumonia (.  Completed 10 days of
Doxycycline and 4 days of Ceftriaxone. The patient was started
on Zosyn for broad coverage although remained Blood cultures
NGTD. Unable to get any information from Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] primary
pulmonologist, although husband provided old CT results from
outside hospital.  Pt intubated electively after much discussion
and informed consent, in order to investigate by bronchoscopy
for a reversible cause of her SOB with the understanding that if
nothing was discovered that she would  be comfort measures only
and extubated.  While preparing for elective intubation, pt
became progressively more short of breath and became distressed.
 Pt urgently intubated.  Bronchoscopy did not demonstrate a
pneumonia nor mass.

2. Thrombocytopenia - History of TCP since bone marrow
transplant for lymphoma treatment many years ago per primary
physcian.

3. Seizure - no further seizures during hospitalization here at
[**Hospital1 18**]. Prior seizure likely secondary to SDH (although appears
chronic) or electrolyte imbalances. Pt kept on dilantin until
made CMO.

4. Subdural Hematoma:  pt transferred her for further managment
of SDH discovered at OSH after seizure, however after discussion
with neurosurgery pt decided to decline any intervention.

5.  Code: after discussion with Ms [**Known lastname 39940**] family (husband and
children), she was made comfort measures only and was placed on
a morphine drip and scopolamine patch.  After several hours of
comfortable but progressive cardiopulmonary failure, the patient
passed away on [**2179-8-21**].
