Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneouos aortic valve replacement (CoreValve)
pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
This [**Age over 90 **] year old patient with a history of prior CABG has been
experiencing fatigue and severe shortness of breath with minimal
activity, which is new over the last few months. He denies any
symptoms occurring at rest. He denies any chest pain. He denies
claudication, orthopnea, pnd, lightheadedness  or lower
extremity edema. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59323**] who referred him

Imaging
ECG: ([**6-17**])
Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior
fascicular block.
Inferolateral lead ST-T wave changes are primary and
non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2120-5-17**]
inferolateral lead ST-T wave changes appear less prominent.
.
ECHO ([**6-18**])
PRE VALVE DEPLOYMENT The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal hypokinesis. The
remaining myocardial segments are mildly, globally depressed.
The right ventricle displays mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is more significant calcification of the base
of the posterior mitral leaflet and posterior mitral annulus.
Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
POST VALVE DEPLOYMENT At initail deployment, the patient
developed near cardiac arrest with right ventricular akinesis.
The aortic valve was quickly replaced and epinephrine was given
with resolution of right ventricular failure. The right
ventriclular function then returned to the pre-deployment state.
The mitral regurgitation was worsened and severe immediately
after this event but after valve replacement returned to
baseline (mild to moderate). The aortic valve and supporting
structure is in situ. The leaflets can be seen moving. The
maximum gradient across the valve was 7 mmHg with a mean of 4
mmHg. There is mild aortic regurgitation with two paravalvular
jets seen.
.
ECG ([**6-18**])
Sinus rhythm with atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm.
Since the
previous tracing of the same date ventricular paced rhythm is
now present.
TRACING #2
.
CXR ([**6-18**])
A CoreValve is in place. The left-sided pacemaker with the leads
terminating at right atrium and right ventricle is noted. Lungs
are essentially clear. Heart size and mediastinal silhouette are
stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax noted.
.
ECHO ([**6-20**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to
jypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall, and
posterior wall. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. An aortic CoreValve
prosthesis is present. A paravalvular aortic valve leak
(trace-to-mild) is probably present. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
