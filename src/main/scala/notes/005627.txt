Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and had a minimally invasive
esophagogastrectomy which he tolerated well and was transferred
to the unit in stable condition.  On post-op day 2, the patient
became hypotensive with MAP 55-60, had an increased oxygen
requirement, and was tachycardic with heart rate 120-150s.  The
patient was intubated without incident for his increased oxygen
requirement and received blood transfusions for a Hct of 21.8.
His chest tube and neck drain had bloody drainage, but became
more serous in the following day.  The patient was started on a
Levophed drip and was able to be weaned from it.  The bleeding
into his drains appeared to stop.  However, the patient remained
tachycardic despite adequate resuscitation.  A chest x-ray
obtained at that time showed bilateral pleural effusions.  An
esophagoscopy showed pink and well perfused mucosa ruling out
graft ischemia/necrosis as the cause for the patient's
tachycardia and increased oxygen requirement.  The plan at this
point was for conservative management.  Zosyn was started for
empiric antibiotic therapy.  Attempts were made to wean the
sedation were thwarted by the patient's agitation.  In addition,
the patient did not tolerate vent weanings well.  Tube feeds
were started to provide nutrition.

On post-op day 4, a CT scan was obtained which showed a moderate
to large sized right pleural effusion.  Interventional radiology
was consulted to tap this effusion and they were able to tap
800cc of bloody drainage.  The patient had to be restarted on a
Levophed drip for hypotension.  With failure to wean the patient
from the vent, the decision was made to take the patient to the
OR for a right thoracoscopy with evacuation of right hemothorax
on [**2132-1-10**].  The patient tolerated this surgery well and the
right lung was seen to expand fully in the OR after evacuation
of the hemothorax.  The following day, the patient was able to
be extubated from the vent and was able to be weaned from
Levophed.  Despite extubation, the patient continued to be
agitated requiring haldol at times.  He also developed suicidal
ideations and Psychiatry was consulted.  A one to one sitter was
provided and the patient was started on zyprexa to which he had
a good response.

The patient remained stable and was transferred to the floor on
[**2132-1-16**].  On [**1-17**], the patient spiked a fever of 101.7 and was
found to have a klebsiella urinary tract infection and was
treated with Ancef.  The patient also develop some erythema at
his neck drain site.  A neck CT scan showed an abscess at the
superficial margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The drain
was d/c'd, the wound was opened up, pus was drained, and packed
with nugauze.  The patient's erythema resolved and the drainage
stopped.

Physical therapy was consulted to assist the patient with
ambulation and he was able to ambulated without assistance.  The
patient continued to require supplemental oxygen to keep his
SaO2 up and was discharged with home supplemental oxygen
therapy.  Serial chest x-rays showed stable basilar atelectasis
and consolidations with no evidence of increasing pleural
effusion.  Nebulizer treatments were provided to the patient
which helped with his oxygenation.  After the patient was
extubated, he had had persistent coughing which worsened
whenever he swallowed liquids.  There was concern for aspiration
and a video swallow exam was obtained which indeed did show
moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids
when he swallowed with his head upright.  He was able to achieve
a functional swallow for soft solids and thin liquids when he
swallowed with his chin to his chest.  At discharge, he was
following these aspiration precautions well and will follow up
with the outpatient swallowing therapy here.  The patient was
discharged with tube feeds to maintain his
