Date of Birth:   [**2081-4-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  ICU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for recent
right-sided aortic arch repair due to posterior aortic arch
with tracheal and esophageal compression, as well as severe
tracheomalacia status post posterior tracheal mesh placement
by Interventional Pulmonology.  Both of these procedures were
done within the past two to three months at [**Hospital6 1760**]; this hospital course was
complicated by Pseudomonal sepsis and MRSA pneumonia.  The
patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2110-9-22**] after arriving in the Interventional Pulmonary Suite
for question of scheduled appointment.  There seemed to have
been some confusion as the patient was unexpected at the
Bronch Suite and was subsequently transferred to the
Emergency Department for ventilator support while awaiting
transfer back to pulmonary rehabilitation.

Upon arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient complained of
diffuse abdominal pain as well as nausea and vomiting, which
appeared to have been chronic times two months.  However, the
patient was subsequently admitted to the ICU for ventilator
support and question of diffuse abdominal pain despite a
negative KUB in the Emergency Department.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic arch repair as stated in HPI.
2.  Severe tracheobronchial malacia, status post posterior
mesh placement, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
3.  Asthma.
4.  Schizophrenia.
5.  Bipolar disorder.
6.  Behavioral disorder.
7.  Status post percutaneous enterogastrostomy tube.
8.  Status post tracheostomy.
9.  History of pseudomonal sepsis and MRSA.

ALLERGIES:   The patient is allergic to sulfa and penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a prior group home resident
in [**Location (un) 5503**]; however, has been at pulmonary rehabilitation
since tracheostomy placement.  No tobacco or alcohol use.
Father lives in [**Location (un) 5503**].

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. 12.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Synthroid 75 micrograms p.o. q.d.
6.  MiraLax p.r.n.
7.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Reglan 10 mg IV q. six hours.
9.  Ativan 0.5 mg IV q. six hours p.r.n.
10. Remeron 30 mg p.o. q.h.s.
11. Haldol 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.

Of note, all medications are through the G tube.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate
97, blood pressure 153/85, respiratory rate 18-26, saturating
98-100% on ventilator settings, pressure support 20, with
PEEP 10, FI02 40%.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes moist.  The
oropharynx was with mild thrush.  The pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  Neck:  Tracheostomy site with mild purulence but no
erythema, edema, or evidence of infection.  No stridor.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with vented
breath sounds and poor inspiratory effort.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Normal S1, S2.  Abdomen:  Diffusely tender with no rebound or
guarding.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  No right upper quadrant
tenderness.  No splinting.  No fluctuants at the G tube site.
The G tube site was clean, dry, and intact without evidence
of erythema or crepitus.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis
or edema, 2+ distal pulses.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II
through XII were intact.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Moving all extremities and responsive to
questions appropriately.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Notable for a potassium of 3.1,
magnesium 1.2, TSH 14.  Hematocrit 27.2, which is baseline
for the patient.

Plain film of the abdomen revealed no air-fluid levels or
free air.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU for
ventilator support.  She was hemodynamically stable
throughout.  Her potassium and magnesium were repleted as
appropriate.  The patient was given IV fluids for a
creatinine of 1.2 as well as inability to tolerate tube
feeds.  The patient's inability to tolerate tube feeds as
well as diffuse mild abdominal pain and watery diarrhea is
chronic since her discharge from the hospital.  She has been
tested for C. difficile multiple times, all of which have
returned negative at the outside facility.  C. difficile was
sent again from our facility and is currently pending at the
time of discharge.

The patient has been maintained on Reglan which does not seem
to have much of an effect in terms of advancing tube feeds.
The patient did have one episode of nonbloody emesis when
tube feeds were at 10 cc per hour.  Thus, they were turned
off.  The patient was not given any Colace, MiraLax while
here and had mild watery diarrhea.

Would recommend close monitoring of electrolytes, especially
potassium and magnesium for need for repletion given
persistent watery diarrhea.  There was no evidence of acute
infection; however, C. difficile is pending and will
follow-up on this.  The patient may need supplemental IV
fluid through left antecubital PICC line which is patent at
the time of transfer.

In terms of respiratory support, the patient had CT trachea
with reconstruction imaging as well as CT vasculature to
assess aortic arch repair.  It is important to note that
there is no acute concern for vascular issues at this time.
This was just done to reevaluate status post major surgery.
Final radiology read of CT trachea and vasculature in the
chest is pending at the time of transfer.  However, the film
was reviewed with the attending pulmonologist, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
and there were no acute mechanical or obstruction issues
identified.

Would recommend that rehabilitation obtain a copy of final
report of CT trachea and chest when final report becomes
available.  This can be obtained by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] and
asking for the Radiology Department.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is being discharged to the
[**Hospital 12286**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 5503**], [**State 350**] not [**Location (un) 48297**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 38**] as this facility is
closer to her former group home and her father.  She has been
accepted and will be transferred there upon discharge from
the [**Hospital6 256**]

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. eight hours.
4.  Synthroid 100 micrograms p.o. q.d. (of note, this is
increased from 75 micrograms p.o. q.d. secondary to TSH of
14).
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Reglan 10 mg IV q. six hours.
7.  Ativan 0.5 mg IV q. four to six hours standing.
