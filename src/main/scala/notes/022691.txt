AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a 48 yo M with pmhx of alcohol abuse and fall in
[**3-29**] with subsequent closed head injury, right frontal SDH/SAH,
who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2131-5-28**] from [**Hospital3 **] for
evaluation of altered mental status.

Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2131-3-30**] to [**2131-5-1**] after fall down 13
stairs while intoxicated. CT scan with large right SDH with SAH,
interventricular hemorrhage, intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also
with left pneumothorax and multiple rib fractures. Underwent
emergent craniotomy for evacuation of SDH. Hospital course
complicated by ARDS, vent associated pneumonia, trach/peg,
sacral decub, diverticulitis.

Doing relatively well since d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] in early [**Month (only) **]. Now in
wheelchair, but ambulates with PT assistance. He has continued
on antibiotics for pneumonia and has had continued difficulty
with  handling of secretions since his trach was decannulated a
few weeks ago.

Last week had HA. Started on scopolamine patch for secretions.
Friday he was still lucid per fiancee. On Saturday, increasing
agitation hallucinations. When attempting to help him shave, he
took can of shaving cream and put the cream in his mouth to eat
it.  At [**Hospital1 **], patient was found out of his wheelchair on
the floor. Denied head trauma, but confused. Unclear if LOC or
how long he was down. Did have urinary and fecal incontinence
over days; his fiance rejects thinks his confusion is preventing
him from notifying staff and hence he soils self in diaper.

In the ED, head CT demonstrated persistent high-density areas in
the bilateral frontal and right temporal lobes, unchanged from
prior in early [**Month (only) **]. Neurology felt that his mental status was
due to either toxic/metabolic/infectious etiologies, medication
change (scopolamine vs. methylphenidate), seizure, cortical
irritation from blood products, or new bleed. In ED became
increasingly agitated, thinking he saw people who weren't there,
hearing voices, and picking at his sheets. Got Ativan and Haldol
in order to be sedated for an LP (which was neg). After LP, he
was noted to be shaking his upper extremities (witnessed by
neuro resident who felt this was NOT a seizure). At this point,
the neuro resident and ED attending felt the patient was not
safe for the floor. He was given Valium 15 IV x1.

While in ICU for 24 hours, patient was somnolent.  Abx had been
discontinued until patient spiked a fever and the tobra and
zosyn were restarted.  Culture data sent.  Nursing reports thick
copius secretions. Neurosurg following. Repeat head CT stable,
no evidence of new infarct or hemorrhage.  Suggest follow up
with [**Doctor Last Name **] in [**5-2**] weeks for repeat CT. Noted to be tachy to
120s, given fluid bolus with little response. Given an
additional dose of BB, lytes repleted.

Brief Hospital Course:
After a brief stay in the MICU, Mr [**Known lastname 61145**] was transeferred to
the floor.

His mental status improved daily.  Most likely causes were
secondary to medication (most likey scopolamine).  All CNS
active medications including scopolamine, amantidine, and
methylphenidate were held.  It seems the delerium coincided with
the scopolamine patch.  Though amantadine and methypheidate can
cause delerium. apparently these medications had been repsent
for some time.  A bronchitis/pneumonia may have contributed.
Note, an LP was unremarkable. An EEG did not show seziure
activity. Mr. [**Known lastname 61146**] mental status was apparently at recent
baseline by discharge.

He was inital febrile with cough and rales on lung exam. Started
on levofloxacin and flagyl.  He has remained afebrile for past
48 hours.  Will finish a 7 week course of antibiotics. Follow up
chest ray showed improving bilateral infiltrates. Patient had a
SAo2 of 97% RA at rest on discharge.

A swallow eval was done and he was cleared to start thick
liquids.  He should eat seated upright and stay up right for 30
min after eating.

He has had  a sinus tachycardia at times. HR90-100 on discharge.
 Lopressor was increased to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].

He had a few elevated calcium values.  Ionized calcium was
normal as was PTH.  Albumin was normal.  Looking back in OMR
there are some low/normal as well as a few borderline elevated
ionized calcium levels. This should be followed up as
outpatient.
