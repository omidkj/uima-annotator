Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
mental status changes


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy x2

History of Present Illness:
63M h/x HTN, HLD, T2DM, HIT+?, stage IV CKD (previously HD
dependent [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] notes), recent C3-C4 fracture in
[**Month (only) 956**] with resultant quadraplegia.  Patient was admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**2-10**] to [**3-3**] with spinal cord injury, underwent
tracheostomy and PEG placement.  He was also treated for
hospital acquired pneumonia with 8 days of vancomycin and
cefepime. He also reportedly had intermittent headaches and word
finding difficulties during that admission, but CT head remained
unchanged (stable encephalomalacia c/w old infarcts).  He was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-3**] and per family was making
significant improvement, with baseline A&Ox3, and intermittently
talking using Passe-Muir Valve.
.
However, per family there was one incident involving a worker
about a week prior to admission where the patient heard a worker
complaining about having to suction him so often; he reportedly
tried to hold his secretions, and had an episode of LOC.
Unclear if this was an aspiration event.  Family says he has had
a decline in terms of his mood after this episode, but continued
to interact with them and make sense.  However, yesterday
evening his niece visited him at [**Hospital1 **] and felt that he was
more sleepy, not making total sense when responding to
questions, with a "glassy look" in his eyes.
.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] paperwork, patient was doing well until afternoon
[**3-11**], WBC noted to be 2.6 and patient started on levofloxacin
PO. Per other notes, patient had recently been diagnosed with
VAP and had been on cefepime, but felt this was contributing to
leukopenia so changed to levofloxacin.  The patient became more
lethargic over the course of the evening.  In the morning he was
more confused, refused to be turned and unable to respond
appropriately to questions.  They felt he was unable to open L
eye as wide as right and were concerned for new facial droop and
spasm-like movements in neck and shoulders.  He was not in any
respiratory distress.  His vitals weere stable, but he was sent
to the ED because of concern for change in mental status.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.2, HR 86 BP180/100 R 16 O2 sat.
100% on vent.  Patient was not following commands appropriately,
seemed somnolent and confused.  Labs were notable for leukopenia
(wbc 3.1), Hct 28.5 (at baseline), Cr 3.8 (at baseline), INR
therapeutic at 3.1, Trop 0.19 (up to 0.08 on prior admission),
lactate 2.5 and serum tox negative. Patient was given
hydralazine 10 mg IV, Vanco 1 gram IV, Zosyn 4.5 g IV and 1L NS.
 CT abd/pelvis was reportedly performed because of concern for c
diff at [**Hospital1 **] (were empirically treating with flagyl,
although c diff negative), but showed no evidence of colitis,
small pleural effusions R>L, with bibasilar patchy opacities.
CXR showed opacity at right base and CT head showed no bleed but
several old infarcts. He was admitted to the MICU for further
management.
.
On the floor, patient intermittently grimacing, opening eyes and
turning towards verbal stimuli, but not answering questions
appropriately.  Not responding to questions regarding symptoms,
ROS.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo M with recent spinal cord injury and resultant
quadriplegia, A fib on coumadin, HTN, DM2, HL, ? HIT who
presents from [**Hospital3 **] with one day of worsening
confusion and disorientation, likely multifactorial.
.
# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: Differential for patient's
confusion is broad, including infection in the setting of poor
reserve and stage IV CKD, medication effect, seizure, or other
metabolic process.  The most likely cause was thought to be
psychoactive medications and impaired clearance because of renal
impairment. He had multiple medications held (lorazepam,
oxycodone, trazodone), and baclofen redosed to 10mg [**Hospital1 **].  Over
the course of his ICU stay, his mental status improved and he
returned to his baseline. Oxycodone was resumed for pain
control. He had been having dystonic like movements of his neck,
mouth, and shoulders, and intermittent response to commands.
Both of which resolved. Infectious etiology of mental status
change was evaluated. He arrived on levofloxacin which was
changed to vancomycin and cefepime for coverage of VAP/HAP,
sputum culture was negative.  C diff negative at [**Hospital1 **].
Urinalysis unremarkable. Given the resolution with holding and
redosing his psychoactive medications, and given the lack of
culture data, it was most likely toxic metabolic due to
medication effect.  Lor
