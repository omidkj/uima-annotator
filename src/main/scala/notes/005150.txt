History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with a pmh significant for DMII, CVA,
HTN, and several recent admissions/ED visits (most recent
[**Date range (1) 40693**] and [**Date range (1) 17332**]) for altered mental status who presents
with abdominal pain and vomiting.
During his most recent admission, there was concern for
infection given fevers and altered mental status (baseline is
A&Ox2), so patient initially relieved Vancomycin and Atreonam,
switched to Vanc/Zosyn for HCAP and ultimately discharged on
levo/flagyl for treatment of pneumonia (CXR read as negative but
w/ R sided consolidation per discharge summary). He received his
first dose of flagyl upon discharge at 11:30AM on [**6-7**]. His
amitriptyline and trazodone were also discontinued given his
altered mental status. On discharge he had reportedly returned
to his baseline.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 1501**] on the afternoon of [**6-7**], he began vomiting
per report. Per [**Hospital1 1501**] note, pt felt "lousy" and requested to
return to the hospital. He was unable to tolerate POs, and he
was brought back to the hospital for re-evaluation.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 99.5 88 206/88 22 96% RA. Labs
were unchanged from earlier in the day except for a new
leukocytosis (10.9 --> 14.9). Pt underwent CT Abd/Pelvis which
was unchanged from prior on [**6-5**]. He also had negative CXR and
UA. A CT head was done given his hypertensive urgency- this was
also negative. During his ED stay he received metoprolol 5 mg IV
x1, atenolol 25 mg, hydralazine 10 mg x2, zofran 4 mg IV x2. VS
on transfer were: HR 86 RR 22 BP 189/65 O2 sat 95 RA.
On arrival to the medical floor patient is vomiting bilious
material. He denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, chest pain,
palpitations, SOB, coughing, HA, or dysurea. No hematemesis or
bloody stools.

CT abdomen. Impression:
1.  Stably distended gallbladder containing multiple gallstones,
with very
mild but new stranding seen around the gallbladder.
Cholecystitis cannot be
excluded and if indicated HIDA scan could be useful for
differentiation.

2.  No other acute intra-abdominal abnormality identified.

3.  Two small left adrenal adenomas.

4.  Extensive atherosclerotic change including the coronary
arteries.

5.  2.3cm intermediate density lesion in the interpolar right
kidney, not
fully evaluated on a single phase examination, might represent a
hyperdense
cyst but can be further evaluated with ultrasound on a
non-emergent basis

HIDA scan: IMPRESSION: Non-visualization of the gallbladder even
after morphine
administration, compatible with acute cholecystitis. .


Brief Hospital Course:
79 M with history of DM2, CVA, HTN, admitted for acute
cholecystitis sp IR guided perc drainage, hospital course
complicated with severe sepsis, biliary source.

#Acute cholecystitis/Severe Sepsis: Abdominal CT showed fat
stranding around gallbladder. Follow up HIDA scan positive for
acute cholecystitis. Surgery and IR were consulted. IR placed
perc-drain on [**2166-6-8**]. The follow day, pt developed severe
sepsis with biliary source and was transfered to the MICU for
close observation and care. He clinicaly improved after a few
days and was transfered back to the medical floor. He was given
zosyn antibiotics started on [**6-8**] to be completed on [**6-22**], he
completed 7 day course of therapy at time of discharge and will
resume his antibiotics at his extended care facility.

Management of drain:
Gallbladder tube: Check gallbladder tube three times a day.
-Measure and record output every shift
-Do not flush catheter
-Every shift check the patency of tube and that the tube and
drainage bag are secured to the patient
For questions regarding care of catheter call: [**Hospital Ward Name 516**]
resident -pager [**Numeric Identifier 84870**]. [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] resident - pager [**Numeric Identifier 21129**].
Telephone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**].
Troubleshooting: If catheter stops draining suddenly:
1) Check that the stopcock is open.
2) Remove dressing carefully and inspect to make sure that there
is no kink in the catheter.
3) inspect to be sure that there is no debris blocking the
catheter. If there is, then firmly flush 5 cc of sterile saline
into the catheter.
GEN Change the dressing daily. Cleanse skin with 1/2 strength
hydrogen peroxide. Rinse with saline moistened q-tip. Apply a
DSD

#Hypertension: Patient is known to have baseline in 150s, but
the day of presentation his BP range 170-200s. He was briefly
given labetalol 100mg PO and hydralazine 25mg for management in
the short term. However, BP quickly returned to baseline later
that day.

# Diabetes- type 2: Pt was placed on insulin gtt in the MICU for
better control of glucose. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted. Pt eventualy
switched back to home NPH.

#[**Last Name (un) **]: Cr peaked to 2.2 and trended down to 1.6. [**Last Name (un) **] likely
pre-renal in setting of sepsis. Resolved with fluids.

Transitional Issues:
-follow up with surgery to discuss elective cholecystectomy
-has gallbladder tube in place
