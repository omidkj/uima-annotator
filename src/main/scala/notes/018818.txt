Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79yo M with PMH of PE on coumadin, sytolic HF
(EF 35%), AS, Prostate CA, ETOH use who presented to OSH with
SOB and increased swelling of right leg with known DVT. + Cough
and ? low grade temps. AT [**Location (un) 620**], VS: T99.6, 107, [**11/2156**], 20,
93% 4L. LENI noted extension of DVT and patient was given
lovenox 100mg x 1. Also noted to have elevated troponin 0.33 and
BNP 10,190. Given lasix 10mg IV x 1. Also 1" nitropaste. Patient
then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, VS: T 99.6 HR 107 BP 111/87 RR 20 93% on 4L. Patient
underwent CTA that showed interval improvement in previously
noted PEs with no new thrombi. Patient was given dose of
ceftriaxone, azithro for concern of pneumonia.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope or presyncope.

.
Of note, patient triggered on the floor at time of evaluation.
He developed acute shortness of breath, tachycardia with sats of
85% on 5L (though patient was mouthbreathing). Lung exam was
notable for poor air movement and diffuse wheezes. He improved
with ipratropium, levalbuterol, 10 IV lasix.

CTA [**2181-8-23**]:
1. No new pulmonary emboli. Small resolving pulmonary emboli in
the lower lobes bilaterally, right middle lobe, and left upper
lobe, smaller than the prior CTA of the chest [**2181-7-12**].
2. Increasing mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy of unclear
etiology. Attention should be paid on followup exams to ensure
resolution.
3. Two small pulmonary nodules measuring 3 and 6 mm in the right
lung, the larger of which is likely related to atelectasis and
unchanged from recent prior exam. Followup CT in six months is
recommended to ensure stability.

[**8-26**] LENI:
1. Right lower extremity nonocclusive DVT involving the right
external iliac,
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
Questionable
extension into the IVC. This can be better evaluated at time of
dedicated
venogram during IVC filter placement.

2. No left-sided deep venous thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
A+P [**8-29**]: 79y/o with PE, [**Month/Year (2) 7792**], COPD exacerbation, transfered
back to floor from CCU after breathing improved with diuresis,
steroid, and NIPPV.
.
#. [**Month/Year (2) 7792**]: Pt ruled in with [**Month/Year (2) 7792**] with troponin peak of 0.66.
Pt denies having Chest pain at all, however he is not a could
historian and is unclear of his presenting symptoms. Talked with
family, was SOB, and consfused upon admission. There are no EKG
changes, although it is hard to evaluate it in setting of LBBB.
 Medically manage [**Name (NI) 7792**], pt did not get cath on admission
because to unstable on presentation. No cath at this time since
the ischemic event is complete.  Unable to do stress test at
this time, can not exercise (fall risk), reluctant to do
dobutamine in setting of ACS, Persantine contraindicated in COPD
exacerbation. Will need chemical stress when COPD treatment
complete likely after pt d/c to rehab.
Was on heparin gtt, stoped [**8-29**] after INR was 2.0 x 3. Also on
ASA 81mg daily, simvastatin 80mg, Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **],
lisinopril 5mg, Plavix 75 daily, will continue for 9 months in
setting of [**Hospital1 7792**]
.
#. Resp failure: Patient triggered for desaturation which caused
transer to CCU. Multifactorial, including systolic CHF (EF
30-35%), PE, COPD exacerbation.  Pt significantly improved with
nebs, steroids, levofloxacin, and diuresis.  Pt denies any meds
as outpt, however family confirms on ipatropium. CHF management,
as below.
For COPD exacerbation, finished steroid taper 8/21(2nd day
20mg), nebs, levofloxacin [**6-16**] day course. Pt aslso has PE,
improving as per CTA this admission, s/p IVC filter this
admission. Pt responding inappropriately on questioning [**8-29**].
ABG 7.48/48/62/37, lactate 2.4. Metabolic alk with compensatory
resp acidosis. Bordreline O2 on RA. F/u with VBG 7.39/56/41/35,
lactate 2.1. Lactate improving with hydration. Started on Oxygen
to improve PO2. Pt clinically improved since out of CCU,
breathing unlabored, lungs with decreased crackles
.
# PUMP/ acute on chronic systolic CHF: [**7-16**] echo moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with sveere
hypokinesis of the basal to mid septum and anterior wall, EF
30-35%.  severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. BNP over 10,000 at admission. Depressed
EF likely [**2-10**] CAD given focal abnormailites. Hessitant to
aggressively overdiurese given severe AS. Records state on 20mg
PO lasix at home. Had incrased lasix to 60 PO daily with one
additional 10IV lasix dose in setting of increased crackles.
This caused a Cr increase to 1.7 and pt was orthostatic with PT
on [**8-28**]. Lasix stoped for 2 days now, had bolus IVF, with
improved BP and Cr and crackles on lung exam has also
diminished. [**Month (only) 116**] need to restart maintance dose of 20 PO lasix in
future. Continue lisinopril 5mg, BB.
.
#HTN - On BB, ACE, prn lasix. Pt was orthostatic [**8-28**] with SBP
to 80, improved BP with boluses
.
#PE: PE discovered on previous admission in [**Month (only) 205**]. Reso
