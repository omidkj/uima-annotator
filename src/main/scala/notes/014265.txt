History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31102**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo with h/o COPD who presented with SOB and
hypoxia to low 80's on oxygen supplementation. As per the
patient's daughter, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
for aspiration pneumonia in [**2154-11-3**] treated with
Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, spent 3 weeks in rehab, and then has
been home since. At home she was doing well on 2L of O2 at
baseline. This weekend her grandchildren were sick with a cold.
Yesterday evening she started to complain of problems breathing.
She also had a fever to 100.7. She denies any CP, abdominal
pain, dysuria, changes is her bowel or urine habits, headaches
or open wounds..
In the ED her blood gas was 7.42/33/151 and she was given
Dexamethasone 10, levofloxacin 500, 1L NS and sent to the floor.

.
As noted above, the patient was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 359**]
[**2154**] for aspiration pneumonia, blood cultures growing out S.
pneumonia, and treated with Ceftriaxone/Flagyl. During that
admission the patient had a small r-sided apical pneumothorax
that resolved spontaneously.

.
Chest CT: 1.  No definite pulmonary embolus.  Assessment of the
right lower lobe is particularly limited due to respiratory
motion.  Potential tiny subsegmental emboli are present, but
these are thought to be artifactual.
2.  Severe bronchomalacia, particularly involving right lower
lobe bronchus.
3.  Questionable filling defect in trachea posteriorly at level
of the thyroid gland.  This could represent volume averaging
with a severe area of tracheomalacia or represent a rounded area
of secretions.  Less likely
possibilities would also include a papilloma.
4.  Emphysema with superimposed congestive heart failure.
Asymmetric ground- glass opacity in the left upper lobe is
likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
.
Eccho: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and  cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
distal anterior wall, apex and distal inferior wall (consistent
with a distal LAD lesion). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
CXR: Interstitial abnormality, right lower lung and lingula has
progressed since [**1-5**].  This could be due to pulmonary
edema alone since there is mild engorgement of the pulmonary
vasculature and the heart size is top normal, but interstitial
pneumonia could present this way.
.
EKG:normal axis, SR, HR 80, Q in V1-V3, new TWI in V2-V5. No
STchanges. No signs of hypertrophy.
.
[**1-10**] Cardiac cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessels coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
minimal
disease. The LAD had diffuse mild disease. The small D1 had an
80%
proximal stenosis. The LCX had diffuse mild disease. The RCA had
diffuse
<50% disease and a focal mid 70% stenosis.
2. Limitd resting hemodynamics were performed. The left sided
filling
pressures were elevated (LVEDP was 30mmHg). The central aortic
pressures
were within normal range measuring 137/52mmHg. There was no
significant
gradient across the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter
from the
left ventricle to the ascending aorta
.
Video swallow: no aspiration to nectar thick liquids or purreed
solids.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with COPD and recent h/o pneumonia, admitted with hypoxia
and hypotension. Brief hospital course by problem below:
.
MICU course: Treated for COPD and PNA (finished 7 days
zosyn/vanc course) and VRE UTI (on day [**7-17**] linezolid).
Hypotension initially required transient dopamine, responded to
IVF, nl [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. Elevated trop (0.28) w/ new TWIs V1-3
and TTE with ant/apical/inf. apical [**Last Name (LF) 37320**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was cathed on [**1-10**]:
70% RCA lesion and mild LCx but didn't correlate to TTE/EKG
findings, so no intervention was done. She was initially
diuresed, but then became pre-renal, so likley maximally
diuresed. Now on 2L O2 (on home O2 at night). Video swallow with
penetration but no aspiration, on altered diet. Episodes of
tachypnea with some improvement with ativan.
.
On the floor, she c/o inability to sleep. She denies SOB, cough,
chills, N/V, abdominal pain, LE pain, headache.
.
Hypoxia: Most likely [**3-7**] COPD exacerbation, perhaps [**3-7**]
bronchitis. No clear evidence of pneumonia, but has completed an
adequate course of antibiotics regardless. No pulmonary edema on
CXR this admission and euvolemic by exam. Aspiration may have
contributed. PE unlikely given lack of tachycardia, quick
resolution of hypoxia. Pt satting 94% on RA at time of
discharge. Repeat CXR showing interval improvement in bilateral
pleural effusions, and some residual PNA. Continued nebs prn.
For PNA, pt is to complete a 7 day course of linezolid.
.
CAD: 2 vessel disease, no intervention performed at cath.
Asymptomatic. [**Month (only) 116**] have had an event before admission. Continued
ASA, Plavix, BB, high dose statin, ACE-i
.
DM II: Glipizide to be restarted after linezolid finished at
discretion of PCP
.
Anemia: Baseline Hct appears to be 36-37. Ferritin wnl, low
iron. B12/folate wnl. Guaiac negative in the ED. Hct stable for
several days.
.
ARF: Almost completely resolved, was likely due to dehydration
and hypotension.
.
