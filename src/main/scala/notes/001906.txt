Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
elective VT ablation

History of Present Illness:
a 65M with a history of inferior posterior MI s/p three vessel
CABG in [**2094**] with a large residual scar and recurrent VT who
underwent a VT ablation today. He had an initial event of VT
within a year of his MI and had an ICD placed at that time. He
did well until this past summer when his ICD fired twice, once
for Afib and once for VT. Today he underwent an extensive
ablation of his scar. At the end of the procedure he developed a
slow VT which was broken with lidocaine 150 mg IV x1. He was
started on mexilitine and transfered to the CCU for further
management. EKG NSR 82bpm RSR' c/w right intravenricular
conduction delay TWI V4-V6 when compared with [**2110-10-31**] EKG, no
significant changes are noted.

-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:  None
-PACING/ICD:  AICD implantation for ventricular tachycardia in
[**2094-6-9**] at [**Hospital1 18**], generator placement in [**2098**] upgraded device

placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
65M with CAD s/p MI and CABG, CHF, HTN, HLD, VT s/p ablation
with recurrent VT admitted to the CCU after repeat ablpation and
intubation for airway protection.
.
# RHYTHM: Patient admitted for a repeat ablation of focus of
ventricular tachycardia. On the day of admission, patient went
to the cath lab and a focus was identified and ablated.
Immediatetly after ablation, patient entered a slow VT and was
intubated for airway protection. VT converted to sinus rhythm
with a lidocaine bolus and he was extubated without complication
on HD2. He remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of his
hospitalization. He was started on mexilitine 150mg TID and
sotalol was increased to 120mg [**Hospital1 **]. Metoprolol XL 50mg PO Daily
was continued. Given risk of thromboembolism post VT ablation,
he was started on coumadin with a lovenox bridge. He will follow
up with [**Hospital1 **] anticoagulation and his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 7325**]
for INR monitoring. He was started on lovenox with  and he was
discharged with plan to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in EP
within 1 month.
.
# CORONARIES: CAD s/p MI and CABG x3 in [**2094**]. He was continued
on aspirin 325mg PO daily, simvastatin 80 daily, as well as
metoprolol as above.
.
# PUMP: CHF with EF 30%. Euvolemic on exam on admission to CCU.
He was continued on lisinopril 5mg PO Daily and metoprolol.
.
# Hypertension: Continued home metoprolol and lisinopril.
