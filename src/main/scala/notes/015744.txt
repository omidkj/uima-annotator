[**2153-2-23**] CXR:
FINDINGS: There is mild cardiac enlargement. Unfolding of the
thoracic aorta. Prominence of the central pulmonary arteries and
upper zone pulmonary vasculature. There is hyperinflation of the
lungs, with flattened hemidiaphragms bilaterally. Linear opacity
at the right base is consistent with plate-like atelectasis.
There is slight prominence of the interstitial markings
peripherally. No pneumothorax. The surrounding osseous
structures appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1) Mild cardiomegaly and mild congestive heart failure.

2) Underlying emphysematous changes
.
Transthoracic ECHO: [**2153-2-28**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly  dilated. Right ventricular systolic function
is normal. The aortic root is  mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic  stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+)  mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.

[**2153-3-7**] Abdominal CT:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are trace bilateral
pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.

The PEG tube is in place. Contrast enters the stomach and passes
freely through the small bowel and into the large bowel. No
evidence of extravasation of contrast. There is no
intraabdominal free air. There are no intraabdominal fluid
collections or evidence of intraabdominal abscess. There is a
calcified gallstone without evidence of cholecystitis. The
liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and bowel
loops are unremarkable. There are no pathologically enlarged
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Vascular
calcifications are noted.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder is decompressed
with a Foley in place and a small amount of air consistent with
Foley placement. There is a bubble of air in the vagina. The
uterus is not seen. The rectum, and sigmoid colon are
unremarkable. There is no pelvic free fluid. There is no pelvic
or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci. There
is a region of increased trabeculation in the T9 vertebral body
consistent with a hemangioma.

IMPRESSION:

1) Trace bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
.
[**3-7**] CT sinus:
Small mucus retention cyst in right maxillary sinus. No evidence
of acute sinusitis.
.
Swallow Evaluation [**2153-3-5**]:

SUMMARY: Pt tolerated the placement of the PMV well with no
changes in RR, O2 SATS. Pt has large amounts of secretions
requiring frequent tracheal suctioning, however no secretion
interference appreciated during the evaluation. Vocal quality
was
wfl.

Pt did present with s&s of aspiration during the green dye
swallow evaluation. Pt had throat clearing after all boluses
administered, however no aspirate material was removed via
tracheal suctioning. A video swallow is recommended at this time
to further evaluate swallowing physiology and make appropriate
diet consistency recommendations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
SWALLOWING:
     1. Remain NPO at this time.
     2. Video swallow at rehab to further evaluate swallowing
     physiology and make appropriate consistency
recommendations.

PASSY MUIR VALVE:
1.  ALWAYS DEFLATE CUFF PRIOR TO PLACING THE PASSY-MUIR VALVE!

2.  Monitor O2 Sats / respiration while valve is in place.

3.  Do not allow the patient to sleep with the valve in place.

4.  PMV wear schedule is up to the discretion of the
    nurse and/or respiratory therapist.

2) No evidence of PEG tube leak or intraabdominal abscess.

3) Vascular calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Failure: COPD Exacerbation.
Patient was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory
failure consistent with COPD exacerbation. On the evening of
admission, she had increased work of breathing, refused
non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP and was intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure. Sh She was initially started on
azitrhomycin and ceftriaxone in the mergency department, but
given the clear chest xray, the antibiotics were discontinued.
She was started on steroids and inhalers. She was extubated on
[**2153-2-25**], but was re-intubated later that same day when her pCo2
rose again to the 90s. At the time of reiintubation, she was
noted to be hypertensive and developed crackles and chest xray
was consistent with pulmonary edema. She was given lasix for
diuresis. An echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal
ejection fracition, and the patient ruled out for MI. Her
steroids were tapered to 20 mg po qd. Given slow wean, a
trachesotomy tube was placed on [**3-2**]. She was slowely weaned and
on day of dishcarge tolerated PS 10 with PEEP 5 and FiO2 30% as
well as trach mask x few hours each day.  Will continue to wean
ventilatory at rehab.
.
2. Cardiovascular System.
a. Hypertension. She was started on multiple antihypertensives
which were titrated up:  diltiazem, hydralazine, captopril and
clonidine.  Because of refractory hypertension, a renal U/S was
performed which showed normal renal arteries:
Renal U/S:  Right kidney measures 11.6 cm, and the left kidney
measures 11.5 cm. There is no evidence of stones,
hydronephrosis, or focal lesions. The left renal artery
demonstrates a normal- appearing low-resistance waveform with
brisk systolic upstroke and preserved diastolic flow with the
renal indices of 0.75. The right renal artery also demonstrates
normal low-resistance waveform with brisk systolic upstroke,
preserved diastolic flow, and resisted indices of 0.86.
b. Other: As above, she had a normal echocardiogram and ruled
out f
