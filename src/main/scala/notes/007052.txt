Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Anterior/posterior lumbar fusion with instrumentation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 F with PMH IDDM, A flutter on Coumadin who was
admitted for elective lumbar fusions [**2126-2-25**] and [**2126-2-26**] is
called out of the TSICU after a two day admission for hypoxia in
the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia and BL pleural
effusions. While in the ICU, she had a CTA chest which was
negative for PE in the central pulmonary arteries though
segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries could not be
evaluated secondary to poor bolus timing. She was treated with
Vancomycin and Zosyn for HCAP and weaned down from
Non-rebreather to 3L nasal canula.
.
While in the TSICU, she was intermittantly agitated with
waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status (not her baseline according to
primary team). Narcotics were thought to be playing a role and
were discontinued the morning of transfer.
.
Vitals on transfer t99.0 BP113/43 p61 100% RA. She was somnolent
and oriented to person and place, she was occasionally tearful
and very concerned about her confusion while in the ICU. She
reported moderate pain at the anterior/posterior surgical sites.
She denied dyspnea, chest pain.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous helical acquisition through the chest was
performed
with without intravenous contrast. Coronal, sagittal, and
oblique images of the pulmonary arteries were created.

FINDINGS: The heart is mildly enlarged. There are dense
calcifications of
the coronary arteries and mitral valve annulus. Minimal
calcification is
noted within the aortic arch and descending aorta. There is no
pericardial
effusion. Numerous small mediastinal lymph nodes are noted,
which are not
pathologically enlarged by size criterion. A pacemaker lies
within the left chest wall with leads in appropriate position.
Secretions are noted
dependently within the trachea.
  .
Following contrast administration, the aorta opacifies normally
without
evidence of dissection. The central pulmonary arteries opacify
normally
without evidence of intraluminal thrombus. The segmental and
subsegmental
pulmonary arteries are not well opacified secondary to poor
bolus timing and therefore cannot be evaluated.
  .
There are bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and
moderate on the left. Also noted are bibasilar consolidations,
which may in part represent atelectasis, in addition to
multifocal areas of airspace consolidation are noted throughout
the right lung and also within the lingula and left lower lobe.
  .
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Mild-to-moderate
multilevel degenerative changes are noted throughout the spine.
  .
Although the study that was not designed for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation,
images of the upper abdomen demonstrate no abnormalities.
  .
The IVC is enlarged and the right ventricle and right atrium are
prominent in appearance. There is mild deviation of the
interventricular septum to the left, all of which may reflect
right ventricular dysfunction.
  .
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism within the central
pulmonary arteries.  Evaluation of the segmental and
subsegmental branches is limited secondary to poor bolus timing.

2. Multifocal areas of airspace consolidation throughout both
lungs, with
large right and moderate left pleural effusion. These findings
are most
consistent with multifocal pneumonia versus aspiration.
3. Prominent right ventricle and right atrium, mild leftward
deviation of the interventricular septum and enlarged IVC, all
of which raise the concern for right ventricular dysfunction.
Correlation with clinical history and cardiac echo is
recommended.
.
ECHO
.
IMAGING
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low
normal systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Normal left ventricular cavity
size and regiona/global systolic function. Increased PCWP.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary acute
pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, pneumonia,
bronchospasm, etc.)

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2122**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 66 yoF with PMH IDDM, A-flutter on coumadin admitted for
elective lumbar spine fusion who developed pneumonia and
delirium was admitted to the ICU for two days related to
hypoxemia.
.
# Lumbar fusions: Patient underwent fusion of L4-S1 in a two
staged proceedure involving an anterior followed by a posterior
approach. On post op day 2 she developed hypoxemia and pneumonia
and was transfered to the ICU. She will need to cont
