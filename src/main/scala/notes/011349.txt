Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 67494**] is an 84-year-old
admitted for acute renal failure, delirium, white blood cell
count of 38,000 in the context of diarrhea.  The patient had
chronic medical conditions including COPD (with a home 02
requirement), hypertension, CAD, and chronic renal failure.
[**2176**] for pneumonia, treated successfully with ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, and levofloxacin.  He had acute on chronic
renal failure at this time (admission creatinine 4.3,
baseline approximately 2.0) ascribed to dehydration/prerenal
azotemia.  He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility,
and his family states that he has had loose stools about the
time he returned to home from the rehabilitation facility.
The patient developed occipital pain and mouth pain on
[**2177-12-13**] and saw his primary care physician on
[**2177-12-15**], who treated him with hydromorphone,
acyclovir, and diphenoxylate/Atropine for diarrhea.  The
patient developed confusion the morning of [**2177-12-17**]
which cleared somewhat in the afternoon, and then returned
the morning of admission.

His family brought him to the Emergency Department for
further evaluation.  They noted a decreased p.o. intake
recently, dark, foul smelling stool (Guaiac negative in the
Emergency Department) and crampy abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  CAD, status post MI times two, PTCA, stent in [**2174**]
(hypertension).
2.  Chronic renal failure.
3.  Left renal artery stenosis.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  History of left carotid bruits.
6.  COPD.
7.  Granulomatous hepatitis.
8.  Peptic ulcer disease after gastrectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his wife, has
a 150 pack year history of smoking, quit in [**2162**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother is deceased from
abdominal cancer.  The patient's father died of pneumonia.
Brother has CAD.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No shortness of breath or chest pain,
positive ankle edema, nausea, and vomiting, as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
95.5, heart rate 93, blood pressure 140/60, respiratory rate
20, oxygen saturation 97%.  General:  The patient was a thin
elderly male in no acute distress.  HEENT:  No tenderness to
palpation of the cranium.  Positive oral thrush.  No lesions,
dry mucous membranes.  Neck:  No cervical, supraclavicular,
or axillary lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Bibasilar crackles.

Abdomen:  Scaphoid, soft, nontender, normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  No peripheral edema.  Neurologic:
Fluctuating level of consciousness (somnolent to alert), poor
ability to attend to and answer questions, no focal deficits.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  WBC equals 39.0, hematocrit 39.4.
The differential demonstrated 88.3% neutrophils, 0 bands,
10.3% lymphocytes, 1.1% monocytes, 0 eosinophils, 0.2
basophils, platelet count 383,000.  PT equaled 14.5, PTT
30.3, INR 1.4.  Sodium 132, potassium 5.9, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 17, glucose 70, BUN 63, creatinine 4.6.

NOTABLE STUDIES DURING THE ADMISSION:  1.  A CT scan of the
head without contrast on [**2177-12-18**] demonstrated no
acute intracranial hemorrhage.

2.  A chest x-ray (PA and lateral) on [**2177-12-18**]
demonstrated right upper lobe and right middle lobe
consolidation, unclear whether it is resolving pneumonia or
recurrence.

3.  CT scan of the chest on [**2177-12-25**] demonstrated
consolidation in the posterior segment of the right upper
lobe and to a lesser extent the superior segment of the right
lower lobe.  No obstructing endobronchial lesions were
observed.  There were moderate to harsh bilateral pleural
partially loculated effusions, emphysema, mildly enlarged
lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and anasarca was seen.

4.  A transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2177-12-25**]
demonstrated normal left atrium size, left ventricular cavity
size was normal, normal LVEF (60-70%).

MICROBIOLOGY:  Two sets of blood cultures from [**2177-12-18**] and [**2177-12-24**] were negative for growth.  Stool on
[**2177-12-19**] was positive for C. difficile.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 67494**] was admitted to the medical
floor with a clinical picture consistent with C. difficile
colitis secondary to antibiotic treatment for a pneumonia in
[**2177-10-24**].  Stool study confirmed this diagnosis as
noted in the microbiology section.

He was initially started on intravenous Flagyl for the C.
difficile colitis as his mental status initially precluded
oral medications.  A Gastroenterology consult was obtained
secondary to this evaluation.  There was a concern for an
underlying ischemic colitis.  Empiric antibiotics were added
to his regimen which included ampicillin and ciprofloxacin.

A discussion with the family at this juncture on [**2177-12-19**] revealed that they were not interested in pursuing
aggressive workup for the ischemic bowel, as surgery would
not be pursued for the patient if it was positive.  The
evaluation for ischemic colitis would have been complicated
by the patient's renal failure and the requirement for
intravenous contrast with the CT scan.

The patient was continued on IV antibiotics and he remained
afebrile.  The patient's blood cultures remained negative
while admitted.

Mr. [**Known lastname 111472**] hospital course was also complicated by acute
renal failure on chronic kidney disease.  His fractional
excretion of sodium suggested that he was hypoperfusing his
kidneys which was likely secondary to significant
intravascular depletion.  His albumin was 1.5 during this
admission.

The patient's renal function was supported with small fluid
boluses, however, these were of limited benefit as his
oncotic pressure was very low and much of the fluid ended up
extravascular.

On [**2177-12-22**], Mr. [**Known lastname 67494**] experienced a proximal
supraventricular tachycardia.  His rate was in the 150s.  He
did experience some lightheadedness and shortness of breath
with these episodes, however, experienced no ischemic cardiac
pain.

An Electrophysiology consultation was obtained and the
patient was initiated on a Diltiazem drip.  Mr. [**Known lastname 67494**] was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] II for more intensive monitoring while on
the Diltiazem drip.  It was difficult to titrate this
medication secondary to his hypotension.  Eventually, the
patient reverted back into normal sinus rhythm and was
sustained on an oral regimen of Diltiazem.

Mr. [**Known lastname 111472**] mental status had improved several days after
admission.  He was back to his baseline according to the
patient's family and was able to interact very well with the
many family members that visit.  He did experience several
episodes of transient asymptomatic hypotension.

His hypotension was not adequately responsive to fluid
boluses and he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for more intensive monitoring.  A bedside TTE ruled out
tamponade as a cause for this.  The patient was in the MICU
from [**2177-12-24**] through [**2177-12-27**] with worsening
of his hypotension, hypoxia, and acute renal failure.

The Renal service was following the patient and the issue of
dialysis was discussed with the family who was not interested
in this course of therapy for the patient.

Prior to transfer to the MICU, discussion with the family
resulted in respecting the patient's and the family's wishes
for code status of DNR/DNI.  Despite intense medical
management in the Intensive Care Unit, Mr. [**Known lastname 111472**] condition
declined.

Discussion with the family on [**2177-12-28**] resulted in the
goal of maximizing the patient's comfort level as his
prognosis was very grim.  He was transferred to the medical
floor with the goal of transfer to home hospice.

Unfortunately, on [**2177-12-29**], the patient's clinical
condition continued to decline with significant hypotensive
episodes.  The patient's family was notified, and Mr.
[**Known lastname 111472**] wife, sons and daughters, and many members of the
extended family came
