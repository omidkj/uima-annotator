Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 62 yoF w/ a h/o multiple sclerosis x 28 years now
quadraplegic and bedbound who presented to [**Hospital3 **]Hospital with shortness of breath. Patient began to notice
shortness of breath beginning 4 days prior to presentation. She
denies any chest pain, subjective fevers, chills, or night
sweats. Denies any cough, nasal congestion, sputum, hemoptysis,
weight loss, palpitations. No worsening of her chronic lower
extremity swelling and no lower extremity discomfort. No prior
history of heart disease. On presentation, she did note a
sensation of chest heaviness over the last 4 days. Denies any
nausea, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness.
.
Of note, at baseline, she does have some difficulty breathing
while laying flat and wears O2 at night but has never had a
formal sleep study. No PND. She noted steady progression of her
symptoms over the 4 days PTA. In the past she has required
hospitalization for respiratory distress in the setting of URIs,
however she had not been hospitalized for 3 years prior to this.
She has never required intubation.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital3 17031**], VS 97.4, 117, 156/68, 24, 85%
on 3LNC. Patient reported to have made 1600 cc or UOP following
lasix in route to ED. Exam was significant for moderate
respiratory distress and decreased BS over R lung fields. CXR
was obtained showing what was thought to be a large R sided
pleural effusion. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. ABG was
7.42/45/53/29 on 3LNC. Patient placed on 50% ventimask w/ O2
sats increasing to 94% and improvement in SOB. BNP was normal at
68. D-dimer was mildly elevated at 524. First set of cardiac
enzymes were negative. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
potential thoracentesis and intensive care monitoring.
.
In transit, patient O2 sats remained 87-92% on 50% ventimask.
HRs remained tachycardic in 120s. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], O2 sats
high 80s on 50% ventimask --> mid 90s on NRB.
.
She was admitted to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
her respiratory distress. During her course there, she underwent
TTE which showed preserved LVEF, no significant valvular dz and
no intracardiac shunt. A CTA chest was obtained out of concern
for PE which was negative for PE, but did show extensive mucoid
impaction in the distal trachea and the lower lobe bronchi with
complete collapse of the right lower lobe and segmental collapse
of the left lower lobe. Thus, she underwent aggressive pulmonary
toilet with chest vest and deep suctioning with significant
improvement in her O2 sats so that she is maintaining O2 sats on
2.5L NC prior to transfer to the floor. She reports she is
nearly back to her respiratory baseline.

Pertinent Results:
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old woman with quadriplegia secondary to multple
sclerosis with poor peripheral IV access
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Pls place PICC for access
PICC LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: IV access needed.
The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was
performed.

RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3175**] performed the procedure.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3175**], the Attending Radiologist, was present and
supervised the entire procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
right basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound
guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound
images were obtained before and immediately after establishing
intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
guidewire and a single-lumen PICC line measuring 45 cm in length
was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip
positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of
the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
chest.
The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed. The
catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
dressing applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
4 French single-lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic
venous approach. Final internal length is 45 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: eval for PE, eval for anatomic cause of elevated R
hemidiaph
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old woman with chronic multiple sclerosis, bedbound p/w
4 days increasing SOB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for PE, eval for anatomic cause of elevated R hemidiaphragm

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 62-year-old female with chronic multiple sclerosis, bed
bound now presenting with 4 days of increasing shortness of
breath to rule out a pulmonary embolism.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest was performed without intravenous
contrast followed by CT of the chest post-administration of
intravenous contrast, reconstructions were performed in the
axial, sagittal and coronal planes.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph of [**2197-12-22**].

FINDINGS:

CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

There is a 7 mm low-attenuation focus in the left lobe of the
thyroid gland, this may be assessed further with a thyroid
ultrasound. There is atelectasis present at the lung bases with
almost complete collapse of the right lower lobe and
subsegmental collapse of the left lower lobe. There are
bronchial secretions almost completely occluded in the bronchus
intermedius and the bronchus supplying the right lower lobe.
There are secretions also present in the collapsed segments of
the left lower lobe as well as distal trachea.

There are ill-defined patchy opacities present in both lungs
likely infectious or inflammatory. There are scattered
mediastinal lymph nodes.

There is no central pulmonary embolism, however, given the
extent of lower lobe collapse, a subsegmental pulmonary embolism
cannot be excluded in the lower lobes.

There are multiple hepatic hypodensities, these are too small to
characterize and likely represent cysts and hemangiomas. There
are multiple bilateral renal hypodensities, again these are too
small to characterize and likely represent cysts.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are multilevel degenerative changes
present in the spine.

CONCLUSION:

1) Extensive mucoid impaction in the distal trachea
