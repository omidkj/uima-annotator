Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8587**]
Chief Complaint:
Left hip wound dehisence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ultrasound-guided drainage of left hip fluid collection


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 80702**] is a 73yo female with history of HTN, COPD, anxiety,
and bilateral hip replacement s/p left THA in [**10/2133**] c/b poor
healing, wound dehiscence and possible infection, who is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for further evaluation of possible
infection.
.
Patient underwent L THA at [**Hospital3 **] in [**10/2133**], and has
had a complicated post-op course including prolonged rehab stay,
poor wound healing and wound dehiscence, but per report multiple
work-ups (including cultures) for L hip infection have been
negative.  However, was some concern for infection, and patient
has been on empiric antibiotics with penicillin VK for
approximately 2 months.  Two days ago, patient states she lost
her balance while going up stairs, but denies falling or hitting
her hip.  Was caught by her husband.  She later noted a feeling
of warmth at her incision site, and found the wound had opened
and was draining blood and whitish material.  Denies any odor to
the drainage.  Has had intermittent fevers at home, but she
cannot state how often these occur or how high her temp has
been.  Did have temp of 100.3 last evening.  Also reports she
has had some drainage of the wound before, but she cannot
clarify details. Given worsening pain in left hip and difficulty
ambulating [**1-20**] pain, presented to OSH ED and was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 97.7 78 106/56 16 95%.  Exam notable
for 1 cm wound dehiscence with serosanguinous drainage,
surrounding induration and warmth, but no fluctuance or
erythema. She had limited flexion, internal and external
rotation of left hip secondary to pain.  Labs notable for ESR
80, CRP 54.  No leukocytosis, and chem7 WNL.  Hct 28.5 with MCV
81.  Imaging notable for 11x16x9-mm subcutaneous heterogeneous
fluid collection communicating with skin, which does not appear
to communicate with bone per ortho resident who spoke with
radiologist.  Patient seen by ortho consult resident, who will
staff patient with attending in morning.  Recommended admission
to medicine, and will discuss need for possible L hip
aspiration.
.
Given concern for infection, patient started on empiric abx in
ED with vancomycin 1gm.  However, she developed acute onset of
dyspnea  concerning for anaphylatic reaction, with desat to low
80s.  RR increased to 20s-30s, and patient appeared cyanotic per
report.  CXR did not show any evidence of flash pulm edema.  Had
already received albuterol nebs.  Was placed on NRB, and
received pepcid 20mg IV, diphenhydramine 50mg IV, and solumedrol
125mg IV with improvement in symptoms.  Was quickly weaned to 2L
NC, with sats in high 90s.  Was observed in ED, given dose of
linezolid, and then admitted to floor.
.
On arrival to floor, patient appears comfortable and states
dyspnea has resolved.  She has ongoing left hip pain.
.
ROS: Has dyspnea at baseline, currently improved from acute
worsening in ED.  Chest tightness that improves with Symbicort.
Denies frank CP.  Reports occasional palpitations and
non-productive cough.  Intermittent fever/chills/diaphoresis at
home.  Has chronic HA for which she takes fioricet.  HA not
associated with vision changes.  Patient does have left eye
blindness s/p injury several years ago.  Had nausea in ED during
reaction to vanco, but no nausea.  Denies abdominal pain,
diarrhea, constipation, melena, or hematochezia.  Has lost
weight, unclear amount.  No dysuria, but has had urinary
incontinence since her surgery.  No sore throat or nasal
congestion.  No myalgias or arthralgias other than left hip/leg
pain as above.

IMAGING:

INJ/ASP MAJOR JT W/FLUORO
IMPRESSION:
1. Left hip aspiration procedure with approximately 0.5 mL of
serosanguineous aspirate sent for Gram stain and culture, which
were carried directly to the laboratory after completion of
examination. Not enough aspirate was obtained for cell count and
crystals.
2. Radiopaque contrast material in the left hip joint space
courses at the
lateral aspect of the left total hip arthroplasty hardware in
the proximal
aspect of the left femur and into the subcutaneous soft tissues
of the
proximal left lateral thigh and into the skin through soft
tissue defect.
Findings indicate communication of external skin defect in left
lateral thigh with left hip joint space consistent with a left
hip articular-cutaneous fistula.
3. Small amount of contrast material is seen between metal
hardware and bone interface at medial aspect of proximal left
thigh hardware at level of second cerclage wire (1:7),
indicative of hardware loosening.
