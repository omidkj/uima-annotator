fever, hypotension

History of Present Illness:
27 yo M w/ESRD on HD presented to the ED [**1-12**] with fever and
hypotension. He was feeling well after HD day pta, when he
developed fever and rigors. These were associated with nausea,
leading to vomiting every 20-30 minutes overnight.
.
Day of admission Mr. [**Known lastname 34030**] felt so weak that he fell to the
floor multiple times on his way to the bathroom, though he never
lost consciousness. His profound weakness and persistent nausea
prompted his call to EMS, and he was brought by ambulance to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. He admits to diarrhea since day pta. Per his wife, he
has had no chest pain, dyspnea, abd pain, melena, or
hematochezia.
.
In the ED, he had a temp of 103.6, BP 70/30, HR 140. He was
treated with 6.5 liters NS, and SBP transiently improved to
100s, then drifted down to 80's-90's. he was treated empirically
with IV vanco, ceftazidime, doxycycline, and dexamethasone.
Phenylephrine gtt and norepi gtt were started for BP support. He
was transfused 2 units FFP for unclear reasons. UA, CXR, and abd
CT were completed and showed no localizing signs of infection.
He was admitted to the MICU.
.
MICU course - found to have bacteremia, MSSA, treated now with
nafcillin. TEE neg. for endocarditis, but needs TLC pulled and
cultured once piv access established.


Past Medical History:
ESRD [**1-1**] reflux nephropathy
s/p failed kidney transplant in [**2-2**] and again in [**8-5**]

      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

MCG/ML

.
[**2151-1-12**]  CT-TORSO WITH CONTRAST IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology noted.
2. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis left worse than right with
small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. CT findings consistent with aggressive fluid resuscitation.
4. Questionable bowel wall thickening involving the cecum,
ascending colon, and proximal transverse colon. Diagnostic
considerations include pseudomembranous colitis, typhlitis (if
immunocompromised), further sequela of fluid resuscitation, and
much less likely ischemia.
5. Internal fluid within the colon highly suggestive of
diarrhea.
6. No intra-abdominal abscess. Explanted kidney transplant site
unremarkable.
.
[**2151-1-15**] CXR AP PORTABLE.
Worsening of alveolar consolidative process within right upper,
right lower, and retrocardiac regions probably pneumonia or
multifocal alveolar hemmorhage, edema less likely.
.
[**2151-1-18**] CXR PA/LAT
IMPRESSION: Marked interval improvement in the diffuse
opacities. In retrospect this behavior is most concordant with
alveolar edema. Minimal left base atelectasis and left
costophrenic angle blunting.
.
[**2151-1-19**] tunneled line placement.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 14.5 French double lumen
hemodialysis catheter via the left subclavian vein, with 19 cm
tip to cuff in length and tip in the right atrium. The line is
ready for use.

Brief Hospital Course:
By Problem:
1. Sepsis: The patient was admitted to the MICU on phenylephrine
and norepinephrine drips.  The patient did not require
intubation. Blood cultures grew MSSA.  It was felt that the
patient's sepsis originated from the tunneled hemodialysis
catheter.  Another possible source was the finding on the
abdominal CT of bowel wall thickening.  The dialysis catheter
was removed and the tip failed to grow any bacteria.  Access was
obtained by the angiography service who placed a right
subclavian central venous catheter.  The patient was treated
with naficillin, levofloxacin and vancomycin.  The patient's WBC
dropped, the fever resolved, the blood pressure stablized.  An
ECHO on [**1-16**] showed that there was a possible vegatation at the
tip of the new catheter.  A right femoral central venous
catheter was placed and the right subclavian catheter was
removed.  A tip culture from the right subclavian line failed to
grow bacteria.  On [**1-18**] the patient went for dialysis and after
3 hours the line clotted off.  It could not be cleared.  On [**1-19**]
the femoral line was removed and the angiography service placed
a left subclavian tunneled catheter.  All surveillance cultures
of the blood, urine and stool, including three serial C.diffs
were negative.  Despite the growth of MSSA the renal service
asked that th
