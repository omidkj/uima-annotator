Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]

Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG
with unknown anatomy, aortic stenosis (1.3 cm2), AF, and recent
prolonged hospitalization at OSH complicated by pneumonia
requiring intubation, pulmonary hemorrhage (on Plavix and
Coumadin), and ?amiodarone-induced pulmonary fibrosis who
presents with dyspnea.

He has been home from rehab for approximately six weeks and was
in his usual state of health until several days ago when he
noted an increasing O2 requirement and worsening dyspnea on
exertion. He is on 1.5L O2 at baseline (this has been weaned
gradually since his last discharge) and typically sats 94%, but
his O2 sat fell to the 80s on multiple occasions during the past
few days. His lasix was increased from 40mg PO daily to 80mg PO
daily during this time but his dyspnea persisted. He was seen by
his PCP today and was noted to be in afib with RVR, and he was
referred to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.4 150 98/73 18 100%o2 83%ra. He
was given Dilt 5 mg IV x 2 followed by a Dilt gtt to 15 mg/hr
with improvement of his heart rate to the 100s-120, and SBP fell
to the low 90s. EKG was notable for mild ST depressions in the
lateral leads and trop was mildly elevated at 0.15. Cardiology
was consulted and felt that increased trop represented demand
ischemia and EKG changes were rate-related. He was thought to be
clinically dry/over-diuresed and was given 1L NS. At 6 pm, he
converted to sinus spontaneously at a rate of 60.
.
On arrival to CCU, vitals were 99.3 76 118/53 20 91% on 2L NC.
His O2 sat improved to 97-98% on 3L NC. He denied any CP, and
felt his SOB had improved. He denied any lightheadedness,
diaphoresis, abdominal pain, or N/V. He remained in normal sinus
rhythm.
.
Of note, the patient's family reports that he has also had a
recent short hospital course for a fib with RVR in which he had
elevated cardiac enzymes, thought to be secondary to demand
ischemia. They have a pulse oximeter at home to monitor his O2
sats, and have noted several episodes of increased HR recently.
The patient has generally been asymptomatic during these
episodes. Also of note, the patient recently spent 4 days in the
car, traveling.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke or
TIA. He has a h/o DVT, but no h/o pulmonary embolism. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He has occasional cough,
non-productive. On cardiac review of systems, he denies chest
pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea.

Microbiology:
[**2149-6-3**] Blood cultures: pending at time of discharge, no growth
to date
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2149-6-6**]):    No MRSA isolated.

Cardiology:

ECG [**2149-6-3**]: Atrial fibrillation. Left bundle-branch block.

ECG [**2149-6-3**]: Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing the rate and rhythm have
changed.

TTE [**2149-6-4**]:
Findings: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. A left-to-right shunt (passage of
bubbles) across the interatrial septum is seen with Valsalva
manuever which is consistent with probable atrial septal defect.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Mild global hypokinesis is
present, with more severe hypokinesis of the inferior,
inferolateral, and inferoseptal walls (EF 40-45%Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal
septal motion/position. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Probable atrial septal defect. Mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis with more severe inferior hypokinesis.
Mild right ventricular dilation with borderline normal function.
Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-6-16**],
left ventricular function is less vigorous. More regional
dysfunction is apparent. The severity of aortic stenosis has
progressd.

TTE [**2149-6-9**]: After intravenous injection of agitated saline at
rest and post-Valsalva, there was premature appearance of a very
small amount of saline contrast in th
