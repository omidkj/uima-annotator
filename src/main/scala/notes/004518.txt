[**2158-3-8**] CHEST (PA & LAT)
 The current study demonstrates improved aeration of the lung
bases
bilaterally. Still present at least moderate layering right
pleural effusion
is seen on both PA and lateral views with bibasilar retrocardiac
atelectasis
still seen. There is no pneumothorax. There is no evidence of
pneumomediastinum. The hardware rods are seen in the thoracic
spine. The
patient is after insertion of the IVC filter.


ECHO report
Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP. Normal mitral valve supporting structures. Normal LV inflow
pattern for age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study as patient was not able to
cooperate. The right ventricle may be mildly dilated and
hypokinetic but this cannot be said for certain. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal regional and
global left ventricular systolic function. No significant
valvular abnormality seen.

CT T spine [**2158-3-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval posterior fixation of the mid-thoracic spine, with
improved
anatomic alignment of extensively comminuted fracture at T7.
Persistent mild
anterolisthesis of the superior portion of L7 upon the inferior
portion, of
approximately 6 mm. Persistent small degree of retropulsion of
fracture
fragments by approximately 3 mm into the spinal canal. Limited
evaluation of
spinal canal and its contents due to hardware artifact.

2. Post-surgical changes including subcutaneous air and foci of
air within
the spinal canal.

3. High-attenuation fluid within the pleural space bilaterally
consistent
with blood within the pleural space and hematoma adjacent to the
fractured
vertebral body.

4. Consolidative foci in the left posteromedial lung consistent
with
atelectasis versus contusion. Dedicated chest CT can be obtained
for further
evaluation.

5. Persistent pneumomediastinum.

NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:

The numbering used above is based on prior MR report dated
[**2158-2-28**]
There is a tiny fracture without displacement noted at the
antero-superior
aspect of the T3 body ( series 400b, im 23).

The right pedicle screws are noted coursing outside the anterior
cortical
margin of the vertebral bodies at T4, T5 and T6 levels.



Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery was
consulted given his spine fracture; he was transferred to the
Trauma ICU. He became hypotensive and started on Neosynephrine
drip.  There was concern for esophageal injury and he underwent
a Gastrographin study  which ruled this out. [**3-1**]: to OR for
epidural hematoma drainage.
.
 On [**2158-3-1**] he was taken to the operating for:
1. Posterior laminectomy, full bilateral T6, T7, T8.
2. Transpedicular corpectomy C7 with adjacent diskectomy T6-
    7 and T7-1.
3. Open reduction third anterior interbody cage placement
    with autograft and allograft.
4. Posterior instrumented fusion using pedicle screws T4-
    T10 bilaterally.
5. Autograft from right-sided iliac crest.
6. Allograft.
7. BMP, closure of dural rent for primary closure of CSF
    leak.
There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively he
was taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained for several days.
He was eventually extubated and transferred to the regular
nursing unit.

An IVC filter was placed as prophylaxis.

Psychiatry was consulted for acute change in his mental status;
he was placed on a 1:1 sitter for a short period and was treated
with low dose antipsychotic for multifactorial delirium. He
became stabilized on these medications and the sitters were
stopped. He is alert, oriented x3 and is cooperative with his
care. Social work has also been following closely.

He was evaluated early on by Physical and Occupational therapy
and is being recommended for acute spinal cord injury rehab. The
screening process was initiated by case management.

By the time of discharge on [**2158-3-13**], patient was doing well,
pain controlled, tolerating regular diet. He will be going to
[**Hospital3 **] today.
