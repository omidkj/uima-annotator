Pertinent Results:
[**Doctor First Name 3098**] stent report:
1.  Access was retrograde via the right CFA.
2.  Thoracic aorta:  Type I arch without flow-limiting disease.
3.  Renal arteries:  bilateral disease, mild on the RRA.  The
LRA had a
focal 80% lesion.
4.  Subclavian arteries:  The RSCA had a focal 60% lesion after
the
origin of the vertebral.  The LSCA had mild disease.
5.  Carotid/vertebral arteries:  The right vertebral is patent
without
lesions.  There was mild disease at the origin of the left
vertebral.
The cerebellar arteries are normal.  The basilar system filled
the left
MCA from a patent PCOM.  The RCCA was normal.  The [**Country **] had a
60% lesion
and filled the ipsilateral ACA, MCA and contralateral ACA via
the ACOM.
The LCCA was normal.  There was a focal 90% lesion at the
bifurcation.
The [**Doctor First Name 3098**] filled the ipsilateral MCA.
6.  Successful stenting of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] was performed with a 7.0 x
40 mm
Precise stent.
7.  Right femoral angiography demonstrated severe diffuse
disease in the
RCFA with almost complete obstruction of distal filling from the
6F
sheath.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe [**Doctor First Name 3098**] stenosis.
2. Stenting of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**].
3. Severe left RAS.
4. Severe right CFA disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo man with severe vascular disease with symptomatic [**Doctor First Name 3098**]
disease, 90% stenosis on U/S with amaurosis fugax and possible
syncopal episode now s/p carotid stent with good restoration of
flow.
1. CV:
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3098**] s/p stent: Keep pt on ASA, plavix, atorvastatin. sBP was
kept between 140-160 initially to keep flow brisk in setting of
new stents and then overnight as Neo was weaned BP started to
fall. Neo was increased for a few hours, but then BP remained
stable and Neo was titrated off. Etiology for hypotension was
felt to most likely be increased vagal tone after [**Doctor First Name 3098**] surgery.
Pt will continue to refrain from taking BP meds for the next few
days and follow up for a BP check on [**8-29**].
B. CAD: Continue ASA, plavix, simvastatin. Restart BP meds (BB
and ACE) as outpt after BP check.
2. Pulm: COPD - continue inhalers and nebs prn. Nasal Cannula O2
to keep sats ~92%.
3. Renal: RAS seen on cath. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] likely to place stents in
future. Cr remained stable after surgery.
4. ID: stable.
5. GI: percutaneous biliary drain in place. Scheduled for
surgery [**9-9**] in [**Hospital1 1474**].
6. GU: pt voided easily with good UOP. Restart Proscar on
discharge.
7. Heme: post-procedure hct stable. No s/sx hematomas. No
bruits.
8. Endo: NIDDM. Continue RISS and restart glyburide as outpt.
Diabetic diet.
9. Neuro/Psych: reports no recent EtoH. Pt showed no s/sx of
withdrawal.
10. Ppx: DVT ppx - encouraged ambulation. PT/OT helped. Eating.

11. Comm: with pt and family.
12. Code: Full
13. Dispo: To home with good follow up on [**8-29**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
