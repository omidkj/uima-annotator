HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old woman who
presented with a prior medical history including end-stage
renal disease, quadriplegia, osteoporosis, depression,
congestive heart failure and diabetes, who presented to the
[**Hospital6 256**] on [**7-10**] with symptoms
of constipation, decreased appetite, decreased bowel
movements and flatus.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  She was distended, tender in the abdomen, and
an abdominal x-ray revealed a large bowel obstruction.  In
addition, her physical exam was notable for decreased motion
of the extremities which was consistent with her prior
history of being quadriplegic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was consented and underwent
sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy to reveal a sigmoid volvulus.
At that time, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] discussed the matter with the
patient's family, and consent was obtained for an exploratory
laparotomy.  The patient underwent general anesthesia and
underwent an exploratory laparotomy, during which an adhesive
band about the sigmoid colon was noted.  This band caused a
segment of ischemia within the sigmoid colon and was
resected, creating a loop sigmoid colostomy.

Postoperatively, the patient remained intubated and was
transferred to the Trauma Surgical ICU where she remained
intubated and under close observation for three days.  On the
fourth postoperative day, [**7-14**], the patient was
transferred to the floors, and the remainder of her hospital
course entailed advancing her diet with tube feeding, total
parenteral nutrition, and advancing PO oral intake.
Moreover, the patient, during her entire hospital course,
underwent dialysis three times a week as per her normal
scheduled, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, and was followed, in
addition to the surgical team, by the renal team, the
neurosurgery team, and the psychiatry team for her various
co-morbidities.

On discharge, the patient is now tolerating an oral diet and
receiving adequate sustenance for her nutritional needs.
