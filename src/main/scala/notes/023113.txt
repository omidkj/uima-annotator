[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old man s/p CABG/MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval post op
AP CHEST, 8:44 A.M., [**3-16**]

HISTORY: Status post CABG.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-12**] and 14:

Lung volumes have improved since [**3-14**]. Small bilateral
dependent pleural effusions remain. Mild enlargement of the
postoperative cardiac silhouette could be due to mediastinal
fluid retention, some of which is demonstrated by an air-fluid
level seen on the lateral view at the level of the sternal
angle. Aside from mild basal atelectasis, lungs are clear. There
is no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.

Echo [**3-12**]
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)

Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.9 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 4.0 cm
Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: *0.18 (nl >= 0.29)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 55% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: 3.1 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aorta - Ascending: *3.7 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in
the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is
seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Mildly depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -
hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex -
hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending
aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
thickening of
mitral valve chordae. Torn mitral chordae. No MS. Mild to
moderate ([**1-30**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate
[[**1-30**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Torn mitral chordae are present. Mild to
moderate ([**1-30**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
Bioprosthesis seen in the mitral position. Well seated and
mechanically
stable, with good leaflet esxcursionand trace valvular mitral
regurgitation.
No signoficant gradient across the mitral valve, and MVA by PHtT
> 2 cm2. The
peak gradient across the LVOT was calculated to be 30 mm HG,
with uniform flow
with color flow Doppler and no evidence of turbulence.
No other change.
