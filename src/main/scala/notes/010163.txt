Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Poor oral intake, elevated LFTs.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
35 year old male with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 849**]-Gastaut Syndrome transferred
from [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of fever, transaminitis,
and gallstones.  He was admitted to [**Hospital1 2436**] initially because
he had not been feeling well and had not been taking PO for 2
days; he was therefore unable to take his Depakote. On
admission, he was febrile with mild leukopenia, transaminitis,
hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated PSA;

At [**Hospital1 2436**], UTI was initially suspected but urine culture was
negative.  He had a history of prostatitis and given the PSA was
presumed to have prostatitis again; he was therefore treated
with Unasyn x13 days.

RUQ ultrasound showed gallstones without dilation of the ducts.
HIDA scan was negative for common bile duct obstruction or
cholecystitis.  For the transaminitis, GI was consulted and
thought this was most likely due to Zantac vs. Depakote.  AST
and ALT decreased during the hospitalization, but alk phos
increased.

The Depakote was therefore stopped and the patient was started
on Keppra 500mg PO BID (IV form not available at [**Hospital1 2436**]),
and Zonegran 600mg PO daily.  (Prior to admission, he had been
taking Zonegran alternating 700/800 mg PO daily, and Depakote
1250mg PO BID).  However, it is not clear that he was able to
take the Zonegran as he was frequently refusing PO; he did not
receive
this medication [**2164-8-22**] per med sheets. He had 2 witnessed
seizures [**2164-8-22**], treated with ativan.  EEG showed "slowing with
sharp waves bilaterally, without evidence of epileptiform
activity.

During his hospitalization, he received hydration for his acute
renal failure and creatinine decreased from 1.4 to 1.0.

He was transferred here for further evaluation of his
transaminitis and management of seizures.


Past Medical History:
[**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut Syndrome.  He was first noted to have staring
spells at age 3, and was treated with phenobarbital at [**Hospital1 2025**],
which helped.  At age 17, he had a significant change in his
seizures, having frequent spells of head drop, arm drop, and
laughing.  He had frequent staring spells, and 20-30 drop
attacks daily.  He was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] for LTM, and
underwent several medications but over the course of the year
hhis seizures became intractable.  He received much of his care
at [**Hospital3 1810**] [**Location (un) 86**].  At age 25 he had a vagal nerve
stimulator placed.  Prior medications have included Depakote,
Felbamate, Lamictal, Trileptal, Neurontin, Lorazepam.

Birth Hx: Mom had vaginal bleeding and decreased fetal movements
in the 3rd trimester.  Birth was normal.

Development: Delayed.  First words at 4 years; walked at 4
years.
After that regressed and became non-verbal.

[**2164-8-23**] RUQ Abdominal Ultrasound:  Cholelithiasis with no sign
of cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 35yo M w/hx of [**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut Syndrome who presents as a
tranfer from [**Hospital3 **] for elevated LFTs.
.
# Choledocholithiasis:  Patient had progressive elevation of
LFTs in cholestatic pattern.  Initially at the OSH, this was
suspected to be medication-related and his Depakote was
discontinued.  At [**Hospital1 18**], all his other medications (Zonegram and
fexofenadine) were discontinued per Liver consult
recommendations except for the initiation of Keppra by Neurology
with adequate control of his seizure activity.  Hepatitis
serologies were all negative.  He had mild leukocytosis and low
grade fevers initially at [**Hospital1 18**], which resolved quickly without
antibiotics, making initial cholangitis less likely.  He never
had any RUQ pain on exam, though his response is limited.  He
then had an ERCP that showed multiple stones and underwent
sphinicterotomy. His bilirubin peaked to 11.1 on [**8-30**], which
slowly decreased afterwards. He was on ciprofloxacin and flagyl
for 5 days per ERCP for cholangitis prophylaxis.
.
# A fib with RVR: Following ERCP procedure for gallstones in the
biliary tree, patient was transferred to the ICU floor for
atrial fibrillation with RVR and on diltiazem drip and
hemodynamically stable. Atrial fibrillation occurred in the
setting of extubation and
