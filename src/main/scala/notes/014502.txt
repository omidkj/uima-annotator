Admission Date:  [**2185-12-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-12-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2147-6-26**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU-MED

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is status post myocardial
infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 47126**] is a 37-year-old
gentleman with no known past medical history (as he has not
seen a physician in many years).  He has no known cardiac
risk factors and no family history of coronary artery
disease.

The patient presented to an outside hospital at 7 a.m. on
[**2185-12-8**] complaining of severe back pain that was
mostly left-sided and scapular in nature.  The patient states
that the pain began on [**2185-12-7**] when the patient was
outside in his yard at [**Hospital3 **] in the cold air putting
together a basketball net for one of his children.  The
patient states that the pain came on suddenly, went across
the middle of his back (infrascapular), left greater than
right, with no associated shortness of breath.  No nausea or
vomiting, and no radiation of the pain.

The patient states that a few days prior to the initiation of
the back pain, he had flu-like symptoms; describing fatigue
and muscle aches with subjective fevers and chills.  He
denies any upper respiratory symptoms.  No cough.  No
congestion.  He denies gastrointestinal symptoms.  He states
that his main symptoms were fevers, chills, weakness, and
bach ache.

Over the evening of [**2185-12-7**], he states that the back
pain was coming in waves, and he began to have associated
diaphoresis.  The pain was so bad by the morning of [**12-8**]
that he "couldn't lay flat," so he went to the Emergency
Department at a local hospital.

In the Emergency Department, he described the pain as [**6-15**].
With morphine, the pain was decreased to [**12-16**].  The patient
was noted to have the following electrocardiogram changes at
the outside hospital; he had Q waves in II, III, aVF, V4
through V6.  He had an R wave in V1 (suggestive of a
posterior myocardial infarction), and he had 1-mm ST
elevations in V4 through V6.

At the outside hospital, the patient was given aspirin, three
sublingual nitroglycerin tablets, nitroglycerin paste,
morphine sulfate (2 mg intravenously times four), Lopressor
(5 mg intravenously times one), and was started on a heparin
drip.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any significant
past medical history; although, he has not seen a physician
in many years.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No past surgical history.

CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:  Coronary artery disease risk factors
include no known elevation of cholesterol.  He is a
nonsmoker.  No family history.  The patient is obese and
states that he has been for years.  He weighs approximately
250 pounds and is 5 feet 11 inches tall.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient was taking a
multivitamin and Motrin as needed for back pain.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:   No history of cardiac disease.  No
diabetes.  His father died secondary to lung cancer from a
long smoking history.  He has no communication with his
mother.  [**Name (NI) **] has one sister who is healthy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient owns a cleaning and maintenance
service on [**Hospital3 **].  He has two people who work for him, but
does a lot of the maintenance on his own; which includes
heavy lifting.  He does not smoke and has never smoked in the
past.  He drinks alcohol occasionally; drinking a few beers
per week.  He denies intravenous drug abuse and denies
cocaine use.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient
complained of subjective fevers with chills times three to
four days.  The back pain (as stated in the History of
Present Illness) began on [**12-7**] and continued until
[**12-8**] and was associated with diaphoresis as of the
morning of [**12-8**].  He denied nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea.  No upper respiratory symptoms.  No urinary tract
infection symptoms.  At baseline, the patient states he can
walk one to two miles with no difficulty.  He plays football
and basketball with his sons.  [**Name (NI) **] has never had chest pain,
and he has never had to stop exercise for shortness of breath
or chest pain.  However, the patient states for the last few
years he does not regularly exercise.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Vital signs revealed
heart rate was 89, blood pressure was 135 to 155/85 to 87,
respiratory rate was 18, oxygen saturation was 96% on 3
liters, and afebrile.  In general, the patient was in no
apparent distress.  He was lying flat in bed and denied pain.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.   Extraocular muscles were intact.  Jugular
venous pressure at the angle of the jaw.  Heart examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sound
and second heart sound.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The
lungs revealed bibasilar crackles.  Abdominal examination
revealed obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Positive
bowel sounds.  The extremities were warm with no edema and
good distal pulses.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times
three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Other data from
the outside hospital revealed his hematocrit was 50.9.  His
white blood cell count was 17.9, and his platelets were 209.
He chemistries revealed sodium was 141, potassium was 4,
chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was
10, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 119.  Albumin was
4.3.  At the outside hospital, his initial creatine kinase
was 1892, with a MB of 151, and a troponin of 4.14.

Status post catheterization at 4 p.m. at [**Hospital1 346**], his creatine kinases peaked at
9753, with a MB of 862, and a troponin of greater than 50.
At 7 p.m. (status post catheterization), his creatine kinases
were 7259, with a MB of 570.  Also, after the
catheterization, his electrocardiogram changes had not
resolved significantly.

His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, with a
rate of 90 to 100, a leftward axis, normal intervals, Q waves
in II, III, aVF, V4 through V6, and R wave in V1, ST
elevations of around 1 mm in V4 through V6.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Significant laboratory data revealed
cardiac catheterization which showed the following
hemodynamics; right atrial pressure of 12, right ventricular
pressure of 45/10, pulmonary artery pressure elevated at
42/27, pulmonary artery pressure mean was 32, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 27.  Cardiac output was 5.14.
Cardiac index was 2.2.

Angiography at catheterization showed left anterior
descending artery with no tight stenoses, left circumflex was
100% occluded in the medial portion, and the right coronary
artery showed no tight stenoses.  For intervention, the
patient had an Angio-Jet thrombectomy and stent to his medial
circumflex.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 37-year-old gentleman with no known
past medical history presenting with a large inferolateral
posterior myocardial infarction with a large infarct
territory by electrocardiogram findings and significant
creatine kinase leak.

The patient has unknown risk factors since no medical
followup.  He was status post a stent to the circumflex.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  For
his coronary artery disease, the patient had a stent to his
left circumflex.  He was placed on Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. and
aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.  He was continued on an Integrilin
drip for 18 hours.  His creatine kinases were cycled.  His
peak, as stated above, was 9753, and his creatine kinases
continued to trend down.  His creatine kinase on [**12-9**]
was 3774, with a MB on that creatine kinase of 174.  His
creatine kinase on [**2185-12-11**] had gone down to 902, with
a MB of 21.

For his coronary artery disease, the patient was placed on a
beta blocker which was titrated up as tolerated.  He was
persistently in sinus tachycardia with heart rates ranging
anywhere from 80 to 120.  Therefore, by the day of discharge
(on [**12-1
