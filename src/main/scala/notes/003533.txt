Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness and Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2108-2-27**] Right sided cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
62 year old woman with pmh significant for dilated right sided
systolic heart failure and diastolic left sided heart failure,
presenting with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of
diarrhea. The patient states for 3 days prior to her ICU
admission she had diarrhea and extreme fatigue and DOE. She was
only able to walk a few steps prior to stopping. Normally she
can walk a [**12-23**] flight of stairs prior to stopping due to fatigue
and DOE but in total able to walk up 2 flights of stairs. She
was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and rehydrated, it was thought that her
cardiac index was low due to her dehydration and than she now
had a significant shunt through a large PFO (based on + bubble
then TEE) which was worsening her oxygenation. Her blood
pressure was improved with IVF and dopamine and renal was
consulted for her renal failure who thought it was secondary to
her low cardiac output state. She has been feeling slightly
better over the past few days however still very fatigued and
has not walked so is unable to give a history in regards to DOE.
She has stable [**1-24**] pillow orthopnea now and prior to admission,
no PND. She has noticed an increase in her lower extremity edema
since admission. Her diarrhea has stopped. No chest pain. No LH
or syncope, no F/C/NS or any other complaints.
.
She was transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service for a R
heart cath to [**Hospital1 4656**] the effect of NO on reducing PVR to see
if PFO closure would be helpful.

[**10/2107**])

Social History:
The patient is married. She does have an abusive partner but
states that she feels safe at home. She has very supportive
children and 17
grandchildren. She drinks ETOH socially and denies smoking

Pertinent Results:
[**2108-2-21**] CXR: Since [**2108-1-13**], right pleural effusion
decreased, now small with improved adjacent atelectasis. Left
pleural effusion also decreased, now tiny. Left-sided central
venous line was removed. There is no interstitial edema and no
focal area of consolidation. Cardiomegaly persists.
.

[**2108-2-22**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left
atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve
leaflets fail to fully coapt. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-1-23**], a
right-to-left shung is now identified (no saline used on the
prior study). Right ventricular free wall motion is minimally
more depressed. The severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced
(may be related to lower systemic blood pressure). This
constellation of findings is suggestive of primary RV
cardiomyopathy (ARVC, myocarditis, ischemia) or prior large
intracardiac shunt/ASD and LESS suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, COPD, PPH, etc.).
.
[**2108-2-22**] Renal ultrasound: Unremarkable examination without
evidence of hydronephrosis.
.

[**2108-2-23**] RUQ US: No biliary ductal dilation. Probable gallbladder
sludge. Right pleural effusion.
.
[**2108-2-27**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated marked elevation in
biventricular filling pressures, with a baseline RVEDP of 33
mmHg and a mean PCWP of 37 mmHg; moderate pulmonary hypertension
with a mean PA pressure of 48 mmHg; and preserved cardiac
output.  There was no evidence of right-to-left shunting at the
current loading conditions.
2.  Treatment with 100% FiO2 demonstrated mild improvedment in
pulmonary
vascular resistance with slight worsening of the PCWP.
3.  Treatment with inhaled NO at 40ppm did not change the
pulmonary
pressures significantly.
.
[**2108-3-1**] Cardiac MR:
1. Limited and incomplete study secondary to early termination
of protocol due to MR system failure. Recommend repeat study at
later stage.
2. The left upper, left lower, right upper, and right lower
pulmonary veins were visualized in their correct anatomical
positions and entered the left atrium. Other anomalous pulmonary
venous drainage or ASD cannot be definitively excluded.
3. Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal global
systolic function.
4. Moderate right ventricular enlargement with mild systolic
dysfunction. No CMR evidence of right ventricular fatty
infiltration/dysplasia.
5. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was mildly increased.
6. Moderate [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement.
7. A note is made of moderate right pleural effusion and right
lower lobe
basal atelectasis.
.
[**2108-3-2**] Cardiac CT:
1. No evidence of anomalous pulmonary vein return. There are two
right and
two left pulmonary veins draining into the left atrium.
2. Interval decrease in moderate amount of right pleural
effusion associated with compressive right lower lobe
atelectasis.
3. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
4. 3.6-mm lung nodule. If patient has history of smoking or
other known risk factors, a followup in one year is recommended.

5. Asymmetric breast parenchyma (left > right). Please correlate
with
physical examination.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo female with history of A-fib, CHF, PUD, and Ulcerative
Colitis, presented with hypoxia and hypotension.  Both hypoxia
(secondary to shunting) and hypotension resolved with fluid
resucitation in the ICU.  She was transferred to the cardiology
floor where she has been closely monitored and her heart failure
treated with aggressive diuresis. She began having rectal
bleeding and was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for endoscopy w/
general anesthesia. Cscope report read: 2 small superficial
ulcerated areas with very active oozing and adherent clot were
noted in the sigmoid and distal transverse colon. The rest of
the colonic mucosa looked normal - no evidence of active
ulcerative colitis.   A single clip was successfully applied to
the transverse
