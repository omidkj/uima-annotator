go fully to the left.  She is able to pick up visual stimulation
on the left, but misses bilateral stimuli.  She is able to point
to stimuli both on her right and left side.  She has some
bifacial weakness with a brisk facial jerk, and has full eye
movement.  She sometimes makes a sound. The movement of her lips
is decreased more on the left, but also a little bit on the
right.  Her right arm and leg function seemed to be well
preserved, but the reflexes are brisk and the toe is up.  On the

little
of the left arm.

Pertinent Results:
[**5-4**] CXR: FINDINGS: Right PICC terminates within the right upper
extremity, within the upper third of the arm, as communicated by
telephone to nurse [**Location (un) **] at 9:00 p.m. on [**2197-5-4**].
Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position.
Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for
technique, and lungs appear grossly clear.

[**5-6**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Interval right cranioplasty without
evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally
midline structures. Mild ex vacuo dilation of the right lateral
ventricle is again noted, consistent with right-sided volume
loss.

[**5-8**] LENI's: no DVT


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Neurosurgery on [**5-4**] for preoperative
workup.  on [**2197-5-5**] and underwent the above stated procedure.
Please review dictated operative report for details.  Patient
was extubated without incident and transferred to ICU in stable
condition.  A repeat head Ct was obtained on [**5-6**] which showed
only post-operative changes and interval right craniopasty.
Hemovac was discontinued and removed in routine fashion.  She
was then transferred to floor in stable condition.
On [**5-7**] she was started on a heparin gtt and PO coumadin per CT
[**Doctor First Name **] recs. She worked with PT but was noted to be orthostatic so
she was given an IVF bolus.
On [**5-8**] her heparin gtt was increased. She complained of left leg
pain (calf to hip) so LENI's were ordered. Urine culture from
[**5-4**] & [**5-5**] resulted + ecoli so she was started on cefepime for
10 days duration. A speech and swallow consult was requested
since patient's trach was previously capped and she was taking
PO.

On [**5-9**], patient PTT was 65.7, coumadin 7.5mg was given and her
trach was changed to a #6 portex cuffed. Ortho was consulted for
bilateral knee pain, x-rays were ordered and showed no fracture
or dislocation. Pain still persisted, pelvic films were ordered.
On [**5-10**], patient remained stable. PTT was elevated at 104 and
heparin gtt was held x 1 hour and restarted at 1450 units per
hour. She was discharged to rehab with heparin gtt and coumadin
with goal PTT 60-80 and INR of 2.5-3.5.
