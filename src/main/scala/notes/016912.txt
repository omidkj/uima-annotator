Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for Carotid procedure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left ICA stenting, Bilat femoral angioplasty and Bilateral
femoral patch placement, femoral thrombectomy and left AT
mechanica thrombectomy, hematoma evacuation


History of Present Illness:
78YO F with hx high chol, hyperlipidemia, HTN, hx syncope
presents from OSH with new diagnosis of critical left ICA
stenosis and concern for CAD.  Pt presented to OSH on [**10-22**] after
an episode at home in the morning when she had sudden onset of
pain at the back of her neck and between her scapulae.   [**6-11**],
aching sensation that lasted for 2-3 minutes.  During this, she
had 30 seconds of bilateral visual changes including seeing
colored spots floating.  She said that she was noted to have
slurred speech on arrival.   She denies H/A, CP, SOB,
numbness/tingling/weakness, nausea/vomiting, LH/vertigo, LOC,
fever/chills.   At OSH, her initial vitals were 96.7, 117/71,
76, 18.  CT chest and abdomen r/o aortic dissection but did show
a small AAA. Her blood tests and CXR were not remarklable.  CK
and tropnin's were not elevated.  A lipase was noted to be
elevated at 327.  A carotid u/s was done that showed, per
report, 60-79% left carotid stenosis.  Also, pt had stress test
with imaging that shows anterior reversible defect per report
(however, this is not mentioned in any documentation sent over
from OSH)
______________________________
CCU: Patient admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on [**2143-10-24**] and underwent a
catheterization on [**2143-10-29**] which revealed 90% stenosis of L ICA.
 Today, she was taken for stenting of that lesion.  Following
the procedure, the patient c/o RLE pain and noted not to have
distal RLE pulses--back to cath lab, underwent angiography that
showed occlusion of CFA.  Atherectomy and angiojet thrombectomy
was performed and complicated by a dissection.  She was taken to
OR for R CFA thrombectomy with patch placement and bilateral
femoral angioplasty.  Upon return from OR, per OR notes, had LLE
dopplerable DP and PT, and palpable DP and PT on R. Returned on
neo drip, extubated, SBP's in 120s, satting well.  Per
anesthesia, patient lost 400ccs of blood in the OR, pre-OR Hct
was 25.4.  Received ~1000ccs of fluid.

ROS: Pt describes a syncopal episode 5 months ago-- After
getting up at night to go the bathroom, she "fainted" on the way
back to bed, bruising in her face in several places.   Prior to
that she had a syncopal episode  after an episode of diarrhea.
She recalls having blurred vision after going to the bathroom
and fell in her kitchen.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 78YOF with HTN, high chol, AAA, L carotid stenosis w/TIA
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for carotid stenting now x-ferred to CCU w/
RCFA occlusion s/p Bilat femoral angioplasty and Bilateral
femoral patch placement. Complications are possibly due to
embolic events, i.e. piece of plaque being dislodged (pt has a
h/o AAA) and landing in the leg.

1) Carotid stenosis- Outside records were obtained on hospital
day 2, which revealed critical stenosis of the Left carotid.
The pt seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and planned for carotid stent. Pt to
be evaluated by neuro on monday prior to carotid stenting on
tuesday.  Aggrenox was stopped and the pt was started on aspirin
and plavix per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Th pt's Left ICA was stented and the
pt was stable post-op. The pt's SBP was maintained between 100
and 160 per Dr.[**Name (NI) 3101**] recs. The pt was continued on asa,
plavix, statin. ASA was decreased to 81 mg qd in the setting of
AC on coumadin. Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], anti-coagulated with coumadin
for 2 mos after d/c.

2) Lower ext vasculopathy: Following her stent placement, pt
complained of Right LE coldness. Atherectomy and angiojet
thrombectomy was performed and complicated by a dissection. She
was taken to OR for R CFA thrombectomy with patch placement and
bilateral femoral angioplasty. Upon return from OR, per OR
notes, had LLE dopplerable DP and PT, and palpable DP and PT on
R. Returned on neo drip, extubated, SBP's in 120s, satting well.
One day following surgery, she was found to have left-sided cold
foot with non-dopplerable pulses. She was taken to the OR where
a left femoral thrombectomy and left AT mechanical thrombectomy
were performed. Post-op the pt was stable with palpable DP
pulses b/l, palpable PT pulse on the left and dopplerable DP
pulse on the right. B/l, her feet were warm with sensation/motor
strength intact on exam. However she had increased pain in R
thigh/groin.  US revealed large h-[**Last Name (un) **] compressing the vein.
Vasc surgery called taken to OR to evacuate hematoma. Pt now
doing well post-op with continued but decreased pain, requiring
morphine for control. Her L groin site oozed on [**11-5**] in the pm.
Direct pressure was applied and bleeding was controlled. Vasc
surgery was not concerned and suggested monitoring. US done
shows a 3.2x1cm hematoma.  Vasc surgery called again, and
recommended conservative managment. Pt was bridged to coumadin.
PT ambulated with patient and recommended [**Hospital 31940**] rehab.

3) Renal-  On admit, pt was omewhat dry on exam and Cr was
elevated (1.6) from OSH on admission. The pt's cr fell to 1.0.
Now 1.4, up from 1.0, possibly in the context of aggressive
diuresis with IV Lasix. PT is still volume overloaded. She will
be d/c'd on po lasix with out-pt f/u. Pt's Cr should be followed
at [**Hospital1 1501**] to make sure it trends down to baseline.

4. low hct/low plt--The pt had a drop in hct/plt that is now
stable. This was likely related to hematoma and marrow
suppresion given retic count.
.
5. low-grade fevers/white count/+UA--Pt found to have Gr neg
rods ([**Last Name (un) 36**] pending) on Ucx. Pt started on 14 day course of
cipro. WBC trended down and pt no longer febrile.

6. FEN- Cardiac/heart healthy diet when pt not NPO for
procedures. Continued calcium, vitamin D.  Continue Boost with
every meal. Lytes were repleted as needed.
.
7. PPX: on heparin or coumadin throughout admit as well as PPI.
.
8. Access: Peripherals.
.
9. Code status: full code
.
10 Communication: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and family
.
11. Dispo: to rehab.  spoke to case managment RE: screening for
rehab. Has a bed at a [**Hospital1 1501**].
