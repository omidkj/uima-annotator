Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Infected Pacemaker

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Screw-in pacer wire placement ([**2116-3-12**])
PICC line placement ([**2116-3-13**])
TEE
Removal of pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 86 year old female patient with PMHx significant
for mechanical aortic valve, CHB s/p PM that was complicated by
large hematoma requiring evacuation who presents from OSH after
found to have abscess at previous hematoma site.
.
Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] during which she was
found to be in complete heart block.  Patient had pacemaker
placed however developed large chest hematoma in setting of
being anticoagulated for mechanical valve.  Patient required 9
units of PRBC and had hematoma evacuated.
.
She was discharged to nursing home on [**2-13**] and then was found to
have infected PM with abscess at previous hematoma site.  At NH
her incision under her clavicle began to open and start draining
while she was having temps of 104.  At OSH, she had a WBC of
[**Numeric Identifier 71077**] (69% PMNs, 17% Bands) pacemaker was removed by local
surgeon and patient was started on vanc and gent (per an ID
consult).  She continues to spike temperatures and prelimanary
wound and blood cultures at OSH are growing gram + cocci in
clusters.  Patient was also found to be tachycardic with HR
ranging from 114-140s.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Pertinent Results:
TTE ([**2116-3-11**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size.  Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic
gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve but cannot be
excluded. Significant aortic regurgitation is present, but
cannot be quantified. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There
is mild mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**3-15**] CT Head
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline
structures. There remain large areas of periventricular white
matter hypodensity consistent with chronic small vessel
infarction. A right thalamic lacune is again seen. There is a
fluid level in the sphenoid sinus. The soft tissues are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.

[**3-20**] TTE
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial
appendage. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at
rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-3-20**]
there is no
significant change.
.
[**3-23**] CT Head
FINDINGS: The study is significantly motion degraded at the
lower and mid levels. Allowing for this deficiency, no acute
intracranial hemorrhage is appreciated. There is diffuse
cerebral periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent
with chronic small vessel infarction. Chronic lacunar infarcts
in the left basal ganglia and right thalamus are stable. No
evidence to suggest acute major vascular territorial infarction
is seen. Sphenoid sinus air- fluid level is noted. Carotid
vascular calcification is seen.

IMPRESSION: Motion limited study; allowing for this limitation,
no acute intracranial hemorrhage seen. Sphenoid sinus air-fluid
level (are there symptoms of sinusitis?).
.
[**3-24**] CT Head
FINDINGS: As was the case yesterday, a number of the images are
degraded by patient motion. Allowing for this deficiency, there
is no definite interval change identified. Once again, there is
a chronic lacunar infarct noted within the right thalamic
region, as well as more generalized bilateral cerebral
periventricular white matter hypodensity, consistent with
chronic small vessel infarction. There is no sign for the
presence of an intracranial hemorrhage. There is heavy
atherosclerotic calcification of the distal vertebral arteries
and cavernous carotid arteries. The surrounding osseous and soft
tissue structures are remarkable for redemonstration of the
sphenoid sinus air-fluid level. As was stated yesterday, the
finding suggests possible acute sinusitis but requires clinical
correlation, as sinus drainage could be impeded by the presence
of a nasogastric tube.

CONCLUSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
