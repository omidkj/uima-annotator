Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Catheter L subclavian
Also attempted RIJ.

History of Present Illness:
patient is a 78 yo female with MMP including RA, afib,
osteoporosis with compression fractures, AS and CHF presenting
with 3 days of LBP. Patient said that she woke up 3 days ago
with LBP that has worsening over the past couple of days. Denies
trauma, but admits that she sometimes "bounces on the bed" when
she comes back to bed from commode. Pain is [**10-20**] localized to
low back withour radiation to the legs. Denies numbness,
tingling, LE weaknes, bowel or bladder incontinence. She has not
had pain in this area before but has had pain in the areas of
her compression fractures in the past. Took some tylenol with
little effect, so came in ED.
.
In the ED T 97 Bp 92/60 HR 68 O2 sats91-95% on RA
She trasient dropped her SBPs of low 80s but went back up to low
100s after 1 liter NS. Received a total of 2 liters NS in ED.
Of, note she was started on lisinopril 10 mg Po QD on [**12-13**]. She
also receievd cipro 500 mg x1 for UTI, tylenol 1 g x1 and
morphine 2 mg x1.

Pertinent Results:
CT abd/ Pelvis:
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Bilateral small pleural
effusions have resolved in the interval. Chronic atelectasis and
bronchiectasis is noted at the left lung base.
Non-contrast evaluation of the liver is suboptimal, however
unremarkable. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The
common bile duct is dilated, however, unchanged in appearance
compared to the prior study. Hypodense lesions within the head
of the pancreas noted on the prior study are not appreciated on
this limited non-contrast evaluation. Spleen and adrenal glands
are within normal limits. There is a large type 1 hiatal hernia,
with almost the entire stomach located in the thorax. This
appearance is stable from prior study of [**2144-10-11**] and
appears uncomplicated by obstruction. Several hypodensities are
noted in the renal parenchyma bilaterally, likely representing
simple cysts. There is no free air, no free fluid, and no
pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
nodes. There is scattered diverticulosis of the descending and
ascending colon without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, urinary
bladder, uterus are unremarkable. The sigmoid is redundant.
There is no evidence of acute diverticulitis. There is no
retroperitoneal hematoma. There is right-sided femoral hernia,
containing small bowel loops without evidence of obstruction or
incarceration. The evaluation of the pelvis is somewhat limited
by large streak artifact produced by right-sided total hip
arthroplasty. No free pelvic fluid and no pathologically
enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions. There are multiple compression fracture deformities in
the lumbar and thoracic spine, the degree of compression on T10
as well as inferior endplate of L1 has increased in the
interval.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Interval increase in degree of compression of T10 and L1
vertebral bodies.
3. Type 1 hiatal hernia.
4. Stable right femoral hernia containing nonobstructed small
bowel loops.
5. Interval resolution of pleural effusions.
6. Coronary artery and aortic arch calcifications.
.
MRI T/L spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute/subacute compression of inferior endplate of L1.
2. Chronic compressions of L2, L4 and L5 vertebrae.
3. Degenerative changes at multiple levels as described above
with moderate left subarticular recess narrowing and mild spinal
stenosis at L4-5 level.
6. Multiple chronic compressions in the thoracic region with
increased kyphosis. No spinal stenosis or extrinsic spinal cord
compression. No evidence of acute compression fracture in the
thoracic spine.

CT dated [**2145-12-15**].
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.1 cm and the left 10.8
cm. The renal parenchymal thickness is normal without evidence
of calculi or hydronephrosis. Multiple renal cysts, the largest
one measuring 2.2 x 1.8 cm in the upper pole of the right
kidney.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2145-12-20**] 3:48 AM
Moderate left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema have
increased. Cardiomegaly is moderate and unchanged partially
obscured by the large intrathoracic stomach. No pneumothorax.
Pleural effusion is probably moderate on the left and small on
the right. No pneumothorax.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2145-12-22**] 4:04 AM
There is motion artifact and rotation of the patient. Allowing
for the technical limitations the left subclavian catheter tip
is in the SVC. moderate pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly and small
bilateral pleural effusions are stable. Left retrocardiac
opacity is due to a large intrathoracic stomach. There is no
pneumothorax.
.
ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9 cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
