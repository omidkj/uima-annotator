         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other
fungi.
         FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
