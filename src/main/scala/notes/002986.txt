Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 1182**] was admitted to the SICU and placed on BIPAP/mask
ventilation to manage his hypoxia/hypercarbia.  Zosyn was
started, and he was tranfused 1u pRBCs.  A CTA of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis was obtained that did not show a PE, but a
LLL pneumonia and a R posterior perihepatic fluid collection
were visualized.  He defervesced on HD#4.  By systems:

Neuro: He was admitted on his outpatient regimen of resperidal
for his bipolar disorder.  Psychiatry was consulted and had no
specific recommendations.  They did not think the resperidal was
diminishing his respiratory drive.  Neurology consult did not
think there was a central inhibition of his respiratory drive.

Cardiovascular:  Given the reported history of CHF, and findings
on his CXR an echo was obtained on [**2158-8-15**].  This showed that LV
and RV systolic function were normal(LVEF>55%). There were no
major valvular abnormalities and moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension that had increased from the last study.
He was diuresed with lasix, for diastolic dysfunction.  PA
catheter was placed [**2158-8-19**] with PA 64/32 and PCWP 24-26 and
lasix drip was started.  His PA numbers improved and his swan
was subsequently removed.

Pulmonary:  Treatment was started for LLL pneumonia with zosyn.
He was maintained on BIPAP, however he continued to be somnolent
and tachypneic with elevated pCO2.  He was electively intubated
[**2158-8-11**] and bronchoscopy was performed.  This showed mild LMSB
deviation c/w LLL collapse and minimal secretions.  BAL was
performed and subsequently grew multi-resistant klebsiella.  He
remained a difficult wean with hypercarbia thought to be driven
by lasix diuresis with metabolic alkalosis.  Pulmonary consult
was obtained: thought that pt had pickwickian syndrome with
hypoventilation with diastolic dysfunction/CHF and needed more
agressive diuresis.  His pleural effusions continued to worsen
so more lasix and diamox were admininstered.  His effusions
eventually improved and his oxygenation improved, but he
continued to have a poor respiratory drive, requiring high
pressure support.  Tracheostomy was performed [**2158-8-25**].  Trach
collar trials were unsuccessful due to hypercarbia w/ pCO2 in
the 70s.

GI:  He was started on liquids initially.  After intubation he
was started on tube-feeds.  A post-pyloric dobhoff was placed,
and TF were advanced to goal of 120cc/h of [**2-9**] strength 1cc/kg
formula (currently on impact w/ fibre).

Liver Transplant: LFT's and coags were normal on admission.  His
[**Last Name (un) **] was held because of persistently high levels.  He was
switched to cyclosporin (neoral) with good levels.  His current
regimen includes: MMF 1gram [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 10mg qd, and neoral
200mg [**Hospital1 **].  His valcyte and fluconazole were discontinued.  He
continues on bactrim.  He will need full labs, including
cyclosporin level twice weekly.  The t-tube remained clamped.

GU: Given his respiratory failure and CHF, he was diuresed with
lasix, with intermittent diamox to manage metabolic alkalosis.
His creatinine peaked at 1.8, and subsequently came down to 1.2
and stabilized.

HEME:  Required blood transfusions initially for a
borderline/low HCT of 28.  He otherwise stabilized with no major
issues.

ID:  He was started on zosyn emperically, however his BAL grew
multiresistant klebsiella, sensitive only to meropenem.  He
completed a 14 day course on [**2158-8-28**], and remained afebrile with
a normal WBC count.

END:  His insulin regimen was adjusted, and his glargine was
incresed to 80u at HS.

Wound:  His abdominal wound was managed with a VAC dressing,
changed every 3 days.  The wound was clean and granulating well.
