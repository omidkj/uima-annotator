Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
N/V, Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. female, resident at [**Hospital3 2558**] with PMHx significant
for multiple abdominal surgeries, including Billroth 2 revised
with conversion to Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy for PUD and
subtotal colectomy with ostomy for perforated bowel as well as
CAD s/p CABG in '[**98**] with patent grafts in '[**06**], atrial
fibrillation, HTN, hypothyroidism who presents with a chief
complaint of RLQ abdominal pain since last night. Patient has
chronic abdominal pain, usually occuring after meals, thought to
be an anginal equivalent - often responding to SL nitro. She is
reported to have suddenly grabbed the RLQ of her abdomen
lastnight complaining of pain. She later had an episode of
"coffee-ground" emesis that was reportedly gastrocult negative.
Her ostomy output has not been melanic or with gross blood. She
denies chest pain, shortness of breath, increased ostomy output,
dysuria or hematuria. She was brought in to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER for
further evaluation.
.
In the ED, vitals were T - 99.6, HR - 90, BP - 138/82, RR - 24,
O2 - 94% (unclear if on room air). She later spiked to 103.6 and
was increased to 4 liters O2 with 96% saturation. Blood cultures
and UA/UCx were drawn with UA strongly positive for UTI. CXR
also showed perihilar opacities concerning for PNA and patient
was empirically started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl. The
abdominal pain was evaluated with a CT abdomen, which was
initially concerning for an obstruction as minimal contrast was
seen at the patient's colostomy. A subsequent KUB then showed
sufficient contrast through to the colostomy site, which along
with an unremarkable surgical evaluation was ressuring for the
absence of a bowel obstruction. EKG showed new STD in the
lateral leads and patient was given ASA. Her blood pressure was
tenuous so she was not given a beta-blocker. CEs were sent off
and the patient was admitted to medicine for further work-up.
ROS: Only remarkable for that mentioned above. Per report from
[**Hospital3 2558**] nurse, patient received her influenza vaccine on
[**2110-11-6**] and her Pneumovax on [**2108-11-1**].
.

   On admission to the ICU after being in the ED for 22 hours,
she was feeling well with no real complaints. She did note that
her abdomen was mildly tender diffusely with palpation, but
denied dizziness, cp, sob, nausea, vomiting. Her initial vs on
admission to the ICU were, T 97, BP 142/52, R 18, O2 95% 4 L NC,
HR 72.

Social History:

MA. Prior to that she lived alone and was independent. Her
husband passed away several years ago. She has 3 daughters who

Physical Exam:
PE on MICU admission:

Pertinent Results:
EKG: sinus, nl intervals, prolonged PR, narrow QRS, TWI in V4-V6
(new compared to prior)
.
Labs: (see below)
.
Imaging:
CXR ([**1-22**]): Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
There
is stable borderline cardiomegaly. The thoracic aorta is
calcified and tortuous. There are new perihilar patchy airspace
opacities concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. No
pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusion. Osseous structures are
grossly unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Perihilar airspace disease with air bronchograms
concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**1-23**]):
1. Perihilar and left basilar airspace consolidation concerning
for
aspiration or pneumonia.
2. Mild gaseous distention of the afferent limb of the Roux-en-Y
with enteric contrast seen within the efferent limb extending to
the left pelvis with more distal collapsed loops of distal ileum
extending to the right ileostomy. Some enteric contrast does
appear to extend to the ostomy site. It is unclear if the
findings are secondary to the relatively short oral prep time or
represent
a very early small-bowel obstruction. Continued surveillance is
recommended.
3. Stable cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas.
4. Unchanged severe compression deformity of the L2 vertebral
body.
5. Dense calcification throughout the intra-abdominal arterial
vasculature.
.
KUB ([**1-23**]):
A nonobstructed bowel gas pattern is evident
with oral contrast seen projecting over the right lower lobe
ostomy. There is a dense right renal shadow and contrast seen
within both ureters from a recent CT scan. There is mild gaseous
distention of the stomach. The lungs demonstrate perihilar
airspace opacities concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. The
aorta is calcified and ectatic. Again noted is a compression
fracture of L2 with severe dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine.


IMPRESSION: Satisfactory bowel gas pattern with progression of
enteric contrast through the right lower abdominal ostomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with PMHx of multiple abdominal surgeries,
CAD s/p CABG, a. fib, hypothyroidism who presents with acute on
chronic abdominal pain, found to have UTI and overall septic
picture.
.
# Sepsis from UTI: Pt initially with tacchycardia and
hypotension which resolved with fluids, and + UA. Patient did
have slight lactate elevation to 3.0, which resolved, and
remained afebrile throughout stay.  Urine Cx showed
+Pansensitive E.coli. Pt intially started on Vancomycin and
zosyn empirically, narrowed to ceftriaxone, and then cipro for
14 day total course.  Foley was removed before discharge.
.
# Abdominal Pain: Pt with chronic abdominal pain which worsened
the morning of [**1-24**] in the setting of suspected sepsis from UTI.
 Pain greatest in LUQ pain, but abdomen was soft and mildly
tender. Lactate initially elevated, but resolved. Upright KUB
showed no free air or obstruction. Pt was transitioned to a PPI
[**Hospital1 **] and given tylenol q6hr for pain.  C diff was negative x2,
and pt had normal ostomy output.  Abdomininal pain improved on
HD 3 when transfered to floor, and pt quickly advanced to full
diet.  Did have reoccurance of general abdominal pain, but
reports similar to previous ab pain.  Treated with tylenol

# Anemia: Pt had anemia and recieved several blood transfusions.
Subsequent hcts have been stable
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: On Coumadin as an outpa
