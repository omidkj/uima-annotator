Admission Date:  [**2120-8-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-9-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2063-10-31**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old female
with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diagnosed this admission, who was
transferred for [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2120-8-8**].

She had a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes
mellitus, asthma, and diastolic congestive heart failure.
She initially presented to [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital on
[**8-1**] with worsening shortness of breath, weight gain, and
peripheral edema, which had progressed over weeks.  A
subsequent workup revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, with
mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy.  She was noted to
have a left-sided pleural effusion as well as an adrenal
mass.  LDH was markedly evaluated at 729.  CA125 was also
markedly elevated at 1634.  A transvaginal ultrasound
demonstrated an abnormal-appearing right adnexal structure.
A diagnosed thoracentesis was also performed which showed an
exudate with abundant large atypical lymphocytes; suspicious
for lymphoma.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for 17 years,
complicated by retinopathy and nephropathy.
2.  Coronary artery disease; status post multiple cardiac
catheterizations showing severe 2-vessel coronary artery
disease.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease; status post right carotid
endarterectomy in [**2115**].
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Asthma.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Obesity.
8.  Hyperlipidemia.
9.  Diastolic congestive heart failure with echocardiogram in
[**2117-12-6**] showing an ejection fraction of 60% with
mild left ventricular hypertrophy.

ALLERGIES:  SHELLFISH, CODEINE, INTRAVENOUS DYE.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Humulin 70/30 70 units in the
morning and 40 units at night, Flovent meter-dosed inhaler,
Combivent meter-dosed inhaler, Serevent meter-dosed inhaler,
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers treatment,
Procardia-XL 30 mg p.o. q.d., Synthroid 150 mcg p.o. q.d.,
Lovenox 50 mg subcutaneous b.i.d., atenolol 60 mg p.o.
b.i.d., [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg p.o. q.d., Imdur 90 mg p.o. q.d.,
Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.i.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
lorazepam 1 mg p.o. q.4-6h. as needed, clotrimazole cream to
affected areas b.i.d., Provera 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was single and worked as a hair
dresser.  She owned her own salon.  No history of tobacco or
alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history significant for coronary
artery disease and diabetes in her mother and father.  There
was no family history of cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed an obese, Caucasian female, in moderate
respiratory distress, temperature was 99, blood pressure
was 140/80, pulse was 78, respiratory rate was 26, SpO2
was 97% on 4 liters, weight was 101.8 kg.  Skin was
anicteric.  No rash.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed extraocular movements were intact.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  No oral lesions were noted.  The neck was supple,
obese.  Lungs revealed absent breath sounds at the bases with
dullness to percussion.  Heart sounds were distant, a 2/6
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.  The
abdomen was obese, soft, and nontender.  Extremities revealed
1+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission showed a white blood cell count of 16.6, hematocrit
was 26.2, platelets were 575, mean cell volume was 81, RDW
was 15.4.  Differential revealed 86% neutrophils.  PT
was 12.9, INR was 1.2, PTT was 26.4.  Sodium was 140,
potassium was 4.5, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 26, blood
urea nitrogen was 94, creatinine was 2.2, blood glucose
was 45.  Magnesium was 2.5, calcium was 9.8.  ALT was 22, AST
was 33, alkaline phosphatase was 79, amylase was 89, lipase
was 75, total bilirubin was 0.2, albumin was 3.6.  Urinalysis
showed 2 hyaline casts with some granular casts.  LDH at
[**Hospital 26200**] Hospital measured 729, CA125 was 1639,
C-reactive protein was greater than 25, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate was 110, CEA was 0.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further oncologic workup and
treatment.  The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, revealing
extrinsic compression of the left lower lobe bronchus.

A biopsy was obtained of the subcarinal nodes, which revealed
B cell lymphoma.  The patient was noted to have melena and
hematemesis.  An endoscopy was pursued, which showed
extremely friable mucosa, suggesting possible involvement of
the gastrointestinal mucosa.

She was seen by Oncology Service and initiated on CHOP.  This
was complicated by tumor lysis and urate nephropathy.  She
developed progressive shortness of breath with hypoxia while
on the medical floor, and ultimately required intubation on
[**8-15**] for worsening hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis;
necessitating transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

She underwent a repeat bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar
lavage which showed mucopurulent secretions in the left lower
lobe with cultures positive for methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Chest imaging revealed multifocal
pneumonia in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe, as
well as compressive atelectasis versus consolidation in both
lower lobes and lingula.  There were large bilateral pleural
effusions.  She was treated with antibiotics including
ceftazidime and vancomycin.  A left-sided thoracentesis was
performed which showed an exudative process.  Her urate
nephropathy improved over time.  She continued to mount
fevers and required ventilatory support despite continued
antibiotic treatment and diuresis; likely as a result of her
inability to clear her pneumonia and lymphomatous involvement
of the lungs.

Given her poor prognosis, the patient's family decided to
withdraw support which was compatible with the patient's
previously stated wishes.  The patient was extubated on
[**9-5**] and died the following morning (on [**9-6**]) at
11:25 a.m.

DEATH/DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, large B cell type.
2.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
