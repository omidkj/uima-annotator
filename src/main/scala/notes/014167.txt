History of Present Illness:
52F patient w/ HIV last cd4 134 ([**12/2140**]) and viral load 239
([**9-/2140**]) discharged from [**Hospital1 2177**] yesterday, went home and did crack
cocaine, was found unresponsive at [**Location (un) **]T stop. Admits
crack yesterday, denies any drug use today. Remains altered but
through ED course MS has improved and pt. has been able to wake
up and answer questions and was A/Ox3. Some labs faxed over from
[**Hospital1 2177**] (unable to locate them in the chart but per ED notes says
they had them) but pt. has not been able to consent for records
release yet. pt. did endorse Hx of cocaine CMP. Serum tox in the
ED was negative and on labs was noted to have hypoglycemia, ARF
and hyponatremia similar to recent [**1-9**] [**Hospital1 2177**] labs.
.
In ED has altered between sleeping and agitation. Workup showed
hyponatremia which is apparently old as Na a week ago at [**Hospital1 2177**] was
128 per ED attending notes, acute on chronic renal failure (last
cr at [**Hospital1 2177**] was 5.2 now 7), elevated BNP at 4200, mildly elevated
trop (0.06 X 2) with new TWF in inferior leads and TWI V4-V6.
Tox screen was positive for cocaine only. CXR showed right-sided
effusion. Received ASA. CT head showed a small SDH. neurosurgery
was consulted and did not recommend any intervention currently
but Q2H neuro checks and repeat CT in 12 hours. Seizure ppx also
needed -> dilantin ordered . Sleeping currently. Ua was positive
for blood after foley inserted and 300 Ketones. Patient was also
noted to be hypoglycemic to 50s in ED so was given an amp.
.
Admitted to ICU for Q2H neuro checks.
.
VS prior to transfer: 98, 87, 135/76, 15, 95% RA.
.
On arrival to the floor patient was sleeping but arousable. Able
to answer questions and knows where she is and the date. Denied
pain and shortness of breath. Other ROS unable to obtain as
patient does not answer questions.

Imaging:
CT head ([**1-11**]): IMPRESSION: Small right parietal subdural
hematoma measures 5mm in thickness. Chronic white matter
disease, could be related to HIV.

Follow up CT Head:
. Stable 5-mm right parietal subdural hemorrhage.
2. Small vessel ischemic disease and cerebral volume loss out of
proportion
to age, which could be related to HIV.

CXR ([**1-11**]): Cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. Cannot exclude
superinfection. Followup post-diuresis recommended.

CXR [**1-14**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
marked
improvement. The pre-existing pulmonary edema has cleared. The
size of the
cardiac silhouette is minimally smaller than on the previous
examination. No
pleural effusions. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
pneumonia. Mild
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Known right healed rib
fractures

Renal US:
IMPRESSION: Echogenic kidneys bilaterally, indicative of medical
renal
disease. There is no hydronephrosis
.
CT Chest:
1. Diffuse nodular ground-glass opacities, most pronounced in
the left upper
lobe; the differential for which is somewhat broad, but includes
inflammatory
or infectious (atypical pathogens) etiologies.
2. Widespread lymphadenopathy.
3. Small right and trace left pleural effusions.
4. Post-surgical changes seen in the right upper lung lobe and
around the
thyroid.

TEE [**2141-2-2**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. Right atrial
appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No thrombus is
seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers (patient intermittenty cooperative). No
late contrast is seen in the left heart (suggesting absence of
intrapulmonary shunting). There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 45 cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate
([**2-5**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac source of thromboembolism
identified. Moderately depressed global left ventricular
systolic function. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
