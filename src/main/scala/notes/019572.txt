Chief Complaint:
Cough and malaise

-Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis of pleural effusion

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21056**] is an 82 year-old man with an extensive smoking
history who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-14**] with one month
of back pain, malaise, and cough without fever or chest pain. He
was admitted. CT chest showed extensive mediastinal adenopathy,
a large R hilar and subcarinal soft tissue mass causing
narrowing of the majority of the bronchi on the right as well as
the R pulmonary arteries, and a pleural-based soft tissue mass.
There were also interstitial changes in the RLL concerning for
lymphangitic spread vs impaired venous return. Background
emphysema was also noted. There was no PE. Metastatic lung
cancer was suspected. He underwent bronchoscopy. [**5-16**] with
transtracheal needle aspirate. L mainstem was WNL, but R
bronchus intermedius and distal bronchioles were narrowed. The
pathology from this is pending. He was also treated for PNA with
vanc/ceftriaxone. He was discharged on [**5-17**] with a 10-day course
of moxifloxacin and plans for follow up with an oncologist (Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 4223**] as well as outpatient head CT and bone scan.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 21056**] went home. He says he took the moxifloxacin as
prescribed (although it isn't clear to me whether he actually
took it daily because he tells me it ran out prior to this
admission, which it shouldn't have). He continued to have the
same symptoms of weakness, malaise, and cough. His cough is
productive of occasionally blood-tinged sputum. He has not had
any fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting, or shortness of breath.
He has had mild intermittent headache and back pain, both of
which are chronic for him. He does not think that any of his
symptoms have changed significantly since his initial admission
to OSH [**5-14**]. His PCP told him to come to [**Hospital1 **] for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.6 P:86 BP:115/62 R:18 96%O2
sat. CXR showed infiltrate. Labs notable for creatinine 1.5 with
no known baseline, leukocytosis, lactate to 2.2. He was given 1g
vancomycin IV, 1g ceftriaxone IV and 500mg azithromycin IV. Pt
had a few minute run of AF in ED with preserved BP, no symptoms,
terminated spontaneously prior to EKG.
.
On the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname 21056**] feels well. He does complain of
generalized fatigue and fits of coughing. Review of systems
negative for recent weight loss or change in appetite. Negative
for chest pain, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain,
dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo M with history of CAD, hypertension, on minimal home
medications presents to [**Hospital1 18**] with weakness, malaise, and cough
following an admission at OSH recent diagnosis of pneumonia and
a R hilar mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy at OSH on
[**2176-5-17**]. He had been discharged on a 10 day course of
moxifloxacin.

## Dyspnea, hypoxia: the patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with CT
imaging consistent with right bronchus intermedius obstruction,
likely by hilar mass most consistent with a malignant process,
most likely metastatic.  LDH yesterday over [**2165**], concerning for
lymphoma vs carcinoma although significant smoking hx suggestive
of carcinoma.  Hypoxia exacerbated by a post-obstructive
pneumonia, tx with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Metronidazole, to be
discontinued on discharge.  Patient scheduled for and had rigid
bronchoscopy in the OR on [**5-28**].  The hilar mass was unable to be
stented, and bile was also found.  There was a question of
potential biliary-pulmonary fistula.  Unfortunately, pt was
intubated in the OR after an episode of A-fib with RVR, and
acute respiratory distress.  Pt was then extubated on the same
day after completely a spontaneous breathing trial.  Further
staging of potential malignancy and evaluation of
biliary-pulmonary fistula was not pursued further, because
patient opted for comfort measures only.  Supportive care with
Albuterol and Ipratropium was continued as needed.  [**Hospital 67382**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and steps were taken have patient
discharged to home as soon as possible.

##.  Oncology:  Right bronchus obstruction likely [**1-2**] to mass
(lymphoma vs carcinoma).  Oncology was consulted.  Final
pathology pending at discharge.  Staging options were pursued,
however, patient declined these and pursued comfort care only.

## Atrial fibrillation: Patient was in atrial fibrillation
shortly after presentation to MICU, treated with Diltiazem.  At
this time, CHADS2 score was 4 (hypertension, age, CVA), but
given recent hempotysis and upcoming procedures, neither aspirin
nor anti-coagulation was begun.  In NSR until morning of
[**2176-5-26**], then had Afib with RVR again.  Patient again r
