History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 17937**] [**Known lastname 6633**] is a 53 yo female with PmHx of asthma, colon
cancer s/p resection, HTN, osteoarthritis who was admitted for
elective R knee arthroscopy [**2161-5-6**].  Ms. [**Known lastname 6633**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] R
knee arthroscopy, with  repeat partial posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] medial
meniscectomy, partial lateral meniscectomy.  Although she
appeared to tolerate her surgery well, her immediate post-op
course was complicated by diffuse wheeze and hypercarbic
respiratory failure of unclear etiology (?bronchospastic adverse
durg reaction) shortly after the LMA was removed, necessitating
intubation.  She had received 1L of crystalloid, Decadron 10 mg
and albuterol MDI x2 in the OR.  Medications administerd in the
PACU included ketoralac, albuterol nebulizers, racemic epi neb,
terbutaline 0.5 SC, lidocaine IV, ketamine, propofol
peri-intubation. Her pre-intubation ABG revealed: 7.26/59/113.
Of note, her post-intubation chest film did not reveal any
infiltrates.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6633**] has recured MICU care from [**5-6**] - [**5-11**].  Her MICU
course was notable for several complications, as follows.
.
1) respiratory failure.  She was maintained on empiric steroids,
initially prednisone -> methylprednisolone, and then
transitioned back to prednisone [**5-11**], as well as frequent nebs
and inhaled steroids.  She was successfully extubated [**5-8**] and
has demonstrated improved respiratory status.
.
2) She was noted to have a lactic acidosis, with lactate up to
11 [**5-6**], perhaps secondary to adverse reaction to propofol
versus ?albuterol.  Her propofol was dicontinued, and switched
to fentanyl/versed for sedation, and albuterol was also held.
Her lactate rapidly returned to baseline by [**5-7**].
.
3) She complained of L-sided CP, and was noted to have T wave
flattening in the lat leads.  She was given ASA, started on
captopril, and was briefly on a nitroglycerin drip, later
transitioned to isosorbide dinitrate.  Serial cardiac enzymes
were negative.  An echo revealed an EF of 65%, with nl LV
thickness and wall motion, and [**1-25**]+ MR.
.
4) ?GIB - after placement of an NG tube shortly after admission,
she was noted to have ?coffee grounds.  A lavage cleared shortly
after infusion of saline.  GI was consulted, who felt that her
coffee grounds may have been secondary to stress gastritis in
the setting of high-dose steroids, and she was begun on frequent
PPI.  Her HCT has remained stable.
.
5) HTN - patient has been noted to have significant HTN, with
SBPs in the low 200s associated with mild HA.  It is not clear
what her pre-admission BP regimen was, though outpatient notes
indicate lisinopril alone (?dose).  She was begun on captopril
-> lisinopril 20mg, HCTZ 25, and metoprolol, with improved
control.  A renal aretry u/s was obtained today for workup of
?secondary HTN.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo female with h/o asthma s/p elective R knee arthroscopy
[**5-6**], who developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
intubation [**Date range (1) 59224**], now recovering well on empiric steroids
and nebulizers.
.
Respiratory failure: likely [**2-25**] asthma flare possibly from
instrumentation vs. adverse medication reaction vs. aspiration.
Continued to do well since being successfully extubated [**2161-5-8**].
Received solumedrol taper and was converted to prednisone.
-rapid prednisone taper
-MDIs
-outpatient pulmonary workup, including PFTs.
.
Lactic Acidosis: Resolved on hospital day 2. Felt to be either
[**2-25**] propofol or less likely albuterol.
.
CP: Currently chest pain free.  Prior lateral T wave flattening,
?etiology given serially negative cardiac enzymes.  However, it
is noteworthy that the CP occurred in the setting of
coffee-ground emesis, and may actually have been GI in origin.
-continue empiric ASA.
-BP control as below
-consider d/c of empiric nitrates
-recommend outpatient ETT if has not been previously performed
by outpatient cardiologist.
.
HTN: Managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35852**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 59225**]), affiliated with [**Hospital1 2025**]).
-Continued lisinopril 20 mg daily
-continued metoprolol, titrate dose (though given asthma flare,
preferred to increase ACE rather than b-blocker)
-Continued HCTZ
.
s/p arthroscopy: Wound was healing well and eventually tolerated
weight bearing with physical therapy.  Will need [**Hospital1 **]
follow-up and suture removal.
.
Gastritis: Suspect coffee grounds were secondary to stress
gastritis as above.
-Continued pantoprazole.
-Outpaient EGD
.
Anemia: HCT stably low with HCT ~31.  With normal iron and
ferritin. Suspect anemia of chronic dz.
.
Hyperglycemia: Steroid induced, continue RISS
.
Occult Bacteremia: 1/4 bottles with Staph epi. in culture [**5-10**]
likely a contaminant. No intercurrent fevers or leukocytosis.
.
FEN: Maintained on cardiac diet
.
