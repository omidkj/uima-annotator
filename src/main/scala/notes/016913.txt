Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2006**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62yo M PMHx HTN, ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 28%), afib,
non-compliance with HD, crack cocaine, recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**]
(most recent [**Date range (1) 27746**]) for volume overload and SOB in setting of
missing HD session, now p/w 1 day SOB. Patient reports that 1
day prior to admission, he had an episode of NB diarrhea,
causing him to miss HD (normally scheduled for
Tues/Thurs/Saturday).  He subsequently noted development of
shortness of breath and L-sided pleuritic CP.  He describes pain
as fleeting, lasting seconds at a time, non-exertional
non-radiating, not related to eating, and without associated
palpitations or diaphoresis.  He also reported chills and
subjective fevers.  Of note, patient also reports using crack
cocaine on the morning prior to his admission.
.
Patient was BIBEMS for further evaluation. In ED initial vital
signs were 100.8 130 152/88 28 100%NRB. Exam was notable for
tachypnea, dyspnea, desatting to 88% during transfer. Patient
immediately initiated on Bipap.  CXR demonstrated bilateral
opacities c/w moderate to severe pulm edema.  Labs were
significant for WBC 7.8(N81), Hct 32.6, BNP48k, Trop 0.37.  EKG
was not sent with patient.  Patient was given [**Date range (1) **], tylenol,
levofloxacin, vancomycin, 1mg IV dilaudid.  Was able to be
weaned off bipap, and patient was admitted to MICU for further
management. Vital signs prior to transfer were 104 133/79 24 96%
6LNC.
.
On arrival to the MICU patient was coughing, producing thick
yellow mucus, but sitting up and talkative.  Vital signs were

.
EKG [**4-20**]
Atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. Indeterminate
axis with
low QRS voltages in the limb leads. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-3-21**] there is no
significant change.
.
IMAGING
CXR [**4-20**]
AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The hilar and mediastinal
contours are stable, with a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta.
Again, seen is a
moderate-sized right pleural effusion with mild right basal
atelectasis.
Bilateral perihilar and pulmonary alveolar opacities are most
suggestive of moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. Left IJ
approach central venous [**Month/Day (4) 2286**] catheter ends in the right
atrium. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized right pleural effusion with moderate
pulmonary
edema.
.
ECHO [**4-21**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild LVH with mild to moderate global systolic
dysfunction. Mild right ventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
CXR [**4-23**]
FINDINGS: Dual-lumen left central line catheter tip lies at
right upper
atrium. The [**2159-4-21**] severe pulmonary edema is unchanged in
severity but has redistributed, with interval improvement in the
left lung and worsening on the right side. Normal heart size,
mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Since [**2159-4-21**] severe pulmonary edema is
unchanged in
severity but has distribution with interval worsening in the
right lung and improved on the left side.

CXR [**4-25**]: In comparison with study of [**4-24**], there are lower lung
volumes,
which may account for some of the increased prominence of the
transverse
diameter of the heart. Again, there is moderately severe
pulmonary edema.
