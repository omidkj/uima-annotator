HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old man who is
well known to the [**Hospital1 69**] who
was admitted to the medical Intensive Care Unit after he lost
his hemodialysis access.  He was admitted to the ICU because
he was chronically ventilated and is a current resident at
the [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital.  The patient was having
hemodialysis on [**2139-10-29**].  He was found in the hallway,
sliding out of bed.  He was pulled up by a five man lift.  In
the process his right subclavian vascular cath was
accidentally removed.  Hemodialysis was discontinued.  Vitals
at the time were afebrile, 97.5, heart rate 75, respiratory
rate 16, blood pressure 128/89, 99% O2.  Vent settings this
a.m. 4 and 40%, total volume 700, PEEP 5.  He was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2139-10-31**] after
it was felt that he would need admission given his
complicating factors of chronic trach and was admitted for
temporary dialysis plan for resumption of permanent line
during this admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for obesity, OSA, status
post tracheostomy, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension,
COPD, cor pulmonale, chronic renal insufficiency and
hemodialysis, lower extremity venous ulcers, dilated right
ventricle and right heart failure, status post GI bleed,
lower extremity edema and elephantiasis, status post
enterococcal bacteremia, herpes zoster, gastric ulcer.

ALLERGIES:  Allergic to Keflex and Oxacillin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Has a history of CVA in his brothers and
sisters.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has a history of remote Cocaine and
Marijuana, quit 10 years ago.  The patient also is a 15 pack
year tobacco user.  Married and lives with his wife who is
also a resident of the chronic care facility.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium 138, potassium 5.8,
chloride 103, CO2 25, BUN 45, creatinine 6.3, glucose 94,
white count of 3, hematocrit 26.8, platelet count 171,000.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient at the time of admission had no
indications for emergent dialysis.  On [**2139-11-1**] he was
evaluated by the renal service and had a temporary right
femoral Quinton catheter placed and underwent hemodialysis
and plans were initiated to try to arrange for permanent
hemodialysis tunnel catheter placement.  His ventilator
status was maintained for the most part on pressure support
ventilation which he tolerated well.  Attempts to wean him to
trach mask failed because of diaphoresis and rapid
respiratory rate with small total volumes of unclear etiology
given his relatively level of comfort on very low pressure
support ventilation.  The patient was stable on [**11-1**] and
[**2139-11-2**].  He spiked a temperature however, to 101 on [**11-1**] and
blood cultures were drawn which ultimately grew out [**5-6**] gram
positive cocci which were identified as Oxacillin resistant
staph.  Because of this, he was started on IV Vancomycin on
[**2139-11-2**] and plans were aborted for inserting a tunnel
catheter.  He underwent placement of a left subclavian
temporary Quinton catheter under interventional radiology
guidance on [**2139-11-4**] and underwent hemodialysis successfully.
Plan at the time of discharge will be to treat for 3-4 weeks
with IV Vancomycin, cultures should be followed periodically
and with plans for likely placement of a tunnel catheter in
approximately 2 weeks to be arranged through his [**Hospital6 **] facility.  At time of discharge,
[**2139-11-5**], the patient is awake, alert, hemodynamically stable,
maintained on pressure support ventilation, has a left
Quinton IJ hemodialysis access placed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine 50 mg po qid, Isordil 20
mg po tid, Clonidine 0.2 mg po tid, Lasix 80 mg po q d and
Lasix 40 mg po q d in addition on hemodialysis days, Monday,

with each meal, Nepro one can with each meal, Vancomycin 1 gm
IV to be dosed according to levels and redosed for levels
less than 15.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will be returned to
[**Hospital3 672**] Hospital with plans to be arranged for
placement of a tunnel hemodialysis catheter in approximately
two weeks pending negative cultures with anticipated [**4-5**] week
total course of IV Vancomycin for his presumed line sepsis.

Phone number for Interventional Radiology is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 93369**].
Treatment and frequency regular tracheostomy section at least
every two hours and more frequently if necessary.
Respiratory therapy, physical therapy.  Diet, renal diet and
Nepro with each meal.  Hemodialysis to be continued as
scheduled.
