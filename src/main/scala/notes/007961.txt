Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Right frontal bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**7-4**]: Right-sided frontotemporal craniotomy
for frontal lobectomy, evacuation of hematoma, microscopic
dissection and duraplasty.

[**7-7**]: Now left sided high frontal EVD

History of Present Illness:
68yo right-handed woman with PMH significant for
hypertension, stroke in [**2135**], vascular dementia, and recent
shingles, presents as a transfer from an outside hospital for
headache. She reports that she was in her USOH until the morning

of presentation, when she awoke with headache at 4:41am. The
headache was frontal and sharp.  She was found to have a right
frontal bleed approximately 3cmX3cm.  Pt was admitted to the
Neurology service and followed by serial exams she was acting
impulsive but awake, alert and orientated x3, inattentive with
some left hand coordination problems.  She underwent an MRI but
was inconclusive due to patient movement.  At approximately 0430
this am the RN caring for the patient noticed a spike in BP to
190s followed by decrease mental status, left hemiparesis and
left sided neglect.  A repeat CT showed enlargement of the right
frontal bleed. Was on aspirin until two days ago

CT [**7-1**]: 1. A large right frontal area of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding edema and associated minimal mass
effect. No other foci of acute hemorrhage identified.
Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic transformation of
underlying brain mass or metastasis. Other less likely
etiologies would include amyloid angiopathy and hemorrhagic
conversion of a previous area of infarction. Vascular anomalies
such as arteriovenous malformations could also be considered. An
MRI/MRA is recommended for further characterization.

2. High-density material located within the sphenoid sinus.
Differential includes inspissated secretions versus hemorrhage
versus fungal infection. Clinical correlation is recommended.

MR [**7-2**]: Incomplete study with motion, limited FLAIR images.
Complete study could not be acquired as patient was unable to
continue. Right frontal hematoma with surrounding edema is again
seen. A repeat study can be obtained with sedation.

CT [**7-4**]: After the right frontal craniotomy and partial
evacuation of the right intraparenchymal hematoma, there has
been moderate improvement in the mass effect, with an
improvement in the shift of normally midline structures. There
are post-surgical changes with an air-fluid level located
anterior to the right frontal lobe and a small extraaxial fluid
collection seen overlying the right cerebral convexity.

MR/MRA [**7-4**]: 1. Compared to the prior study, there has been a
slight increase in the size of the right frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with associated subfalcine
herniation.

2. There has been interval development of marked
intraventricular extension of hemorrhage and associated
hydrocephalus.

3. There is no definite evidence of aneurysm or AV malformation.
There is no definite evidence of underlying tumor, there is
prominent enhancment along the margins of the hematoma which may
be related to the acute hematoma, less likely this could be
neoplastic leptomeningeal enhancement.

4. Medial to the area of the right superior frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, there is an area of increased
diffusion-weighted image signal in the parasagittal white
matter. However, ADC maps are not available to confirm whether
this may represent an acute infarct.

CT [**7-4**]: 1. Marked increased in size of right frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 13 mm leftward subfalcine
herniation and mass effect on the lateral ventricles and
suprasellar cistern.

Pathology [**7-4**]: Acute-subacute hematoma and secondary ischemic
necrosis of nearby neurons.ARTERIOLOSCLEROSIS, indicative of
hypertensive cerebrovascular angiopathy.Rigid, eosinophilic
superficial cortical and leptomeningeal small arteries and
arterioles, consistent with CONGOPHILIC AMYLOID
ANGIOPATHY.Scattered neocortical amyloid plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles, commensurate with ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

CT [**7-5**]: 1. Since prior study, there has been an interval
decrease in the degree of mass effect with mild decrease in the
blood and pneumocephalus seen within the operative bed.
2. Mild decrease in the amount of intraventricular blood.
3. The right intraparenchymal hematoma and the small amount of
subarachnoid hemorrhage are stable compared to prior examinatio
n.

CT [**7-6**]: 1. Mild interval increase in size of right extra-axial
low attenuation fluid collection.
2. No change in right intraparenchymal hematoma and small amount
of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3. Stable hydrocephalus and layering blood within the posterior
horns of the lateral ventricles

CT [**7-7**]: 1. Compared to prior study, there has been interval
placement of a ventriculostomy catheter with tip within the left
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
2. There has been no significant interval change in the size of
the intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and intraventricular
hemorrhages.
3. There is minimal increase in the size of the lateral
ventricles compared to prior examination.

MAP/DVT ([**7-12**]): No evidence for DVT with the right or left lower
extremity

CT [**7-12**]: 1. No significant change in the size of the
intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Minimal decrease
in the size of the intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. No new areas of hemorrhage.
3. Unchanged appearance of the ventricular catheter and the size
of the ventricles.
4. Increased opacification of th
