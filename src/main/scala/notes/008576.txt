Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 70 yo F with HTN, DM2, Dementia, and ESRD on HD who
presented with altered mental status.  In the ED she was noted
to be febrile, hypotensive, tachycardic and with a lactate in
7's, so code sepsis was initiated; the patient had R femoral
central access obtained and received 1L NS, CTX 1gm, and
vancomycin 1gm.  She was also given 1gm tylenol and haldol 2.5mg
x1 and was subsequently admitted to the MICU.  Given her initial
presentation, there was concern for sepsis; yet she had no
leukocytosis or bandemia.  Overdialysis was a possibility, since
it was reported that the patient was dialyzed down 4 kg.  Her
hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachycardia could be
attributed to hypoperfusion.  She responded to 1L of IVF and had
a normal heart rate and stable BP.  There was no evidence of
seizure activity. Her CXR was without infiltrate.  She underwent
LP, and showed no evidence of meningitis.  Her antibiotics were
stopped by the MICU team and she was transferred to the floor.
On the floor her blood cultures came back with 1/2 bottles of
coag neg staph, likely a skin contaminant.  Vancomycin levels
were checked and she received vancomycin at hemodialysis.  CSF
cultures remained negative.  The patient is being discharged on
a 10 day course of vancomycin, to be dosed at hemodialysis for
vanco levels less than 15.
.
The patient's altered mental status was of unclear etiology.
Upon review of OMR notes, patient has presented similarly in
past.  Prior work-up has been unrevealing (EEG: normal, CT: old
infacts).  Her behavior has been noted to have a diurnal
pattern, with the patient being more conversive in the evenings
and mute/not interactive in the mornings.  Previously, neurology
had been following the patient and thought her MS changes were
[**1-11**] toxic/metabolic insults.  Head CT showed no acute changes.
CSF was without infection.  Her hypercalcemia may be
contributing to her mental status.  Per her family, the patient
was close to baseline.
.
The patient's hypercalcemia was thought to be due to tertiary
hyperparathyroidism.  Her cinacalcet was continued.  PTH, TSH,
and Vit D studies were sent as well.
.
The renal team was made aware of patient.  Her metabolic
acidosis was thought to be related to uremia and dehydration.
She was dialyzed on Monday.  Her anti-hypertensives were held
pre-HD.  She was given a dose of vancomycin at HD and cultures
were drawn.  Nephrocaps and sevelamer were continued.
.
The patient was continued on her outpatient medications.  She is
not recommended to go home on two nitrates for her hypertension.
 The Bblocker and ACE may be titrated up to reduce the need for
two nitrates (isordil and NG paste).
