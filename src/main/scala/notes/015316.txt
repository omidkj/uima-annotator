.
Notable imaging:
.
[**8-19**] CT head: R. frontal intracranial hemorrhage with extension
into the third and fourth ventricles with layering of blood
within the occipital poles of the lateral ventricles, stable
shift of the midline leftward and subfalcine herniation of
approximately 8 mm.
.
[**8-21**] CT head: Unchanged
[**8-24**] CT Head: Unchanged
[**8-24**] LE U/S: No DVT b/l
[**8-24**] CXR: RLL, LLL opacity
[**8-25**] CT head: Unchanged
[**8-27**] CXR: RLL opacity
.
[**2159-9-4**] Head CT -- IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in density of
the hemorrhage along the left frontal catheter tract,
intraventricular hemorrhage, as well as right frontal lobe
hemorrhage, consistent with evolution of blood products.
Unchanged degree of rightward shift of septum pellucidum.  No
new foci of intracranial hemorrhage. Minimal increase in size of
right frontal extraaxial collection.
.
[**2159-9-4**] BILATERAL DUPLEX VENOUS LOWER EXTREMITY:  Grayscale,
color, and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral,
superficial femoral, popliteal and calf veins were performed.
There is normal flow, compression, and augmentation demonstrated
in these vessels.  The greater saphenous vein demonstrates
pulsatile flow that may be related to reflux secondary to
worsening CHF.
.
[**2159-9-4**] AP chest compared to [**8-29**] through 7:
Lungs remain essentially clear following resolution of the left
lower lobe atelectasis, no pleural effusion is seen.  Lung
apices are partially excluded from the examination.  No evidence
of pneumothorax elsewhere.  Heart size normal.  ET tube in
standard placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
72M h/o CAD s/p CABG, AAA, HTN, [**Hospital 15134**] transferred from [**Hospital 2586**] on [**2159-8-19**] with traumatic ICH s/p fall (?mechanical
v syncope), admitted to Neurosurgery on [**2159-8-19**] for large
IPH/IVH.  Underwent emergent right decompressive craniotomy and
left EVD placement on [**2159-8-19**], with stable repeat CT after EVD
clamped and removed.

# Respiratory distress: [**Name (NI) 5601**], pt febrile and started
on vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia. His neuro exam slowly
improved and he was transferred to stepdown unit [**8-31**]. He had
respiratory decompensation and required re-intubation [**9-4**] and
was transferred to MICU.  On [**2159-9-4**], pt again reported to be in
respiratory distress, RR = 50's with accessory muscles, 02 sats
in mid-90s.  ABG 7.46/33/185 on non-rebreather.  A large amount
of thick sputum removed with suctioning, with RR reportedly
improved into the 30's, but with periods of apnea.  Pt was
re-intubated for "airway protection," and transferred to the
MICU.  Respiratory distress suspected to be primarily related to
mucus plugging.  CXR improved.  LENIS negative.  ABG suggestive
of hyperventilation: low CO2, nml 02.  Pt required minimal vent
settings and was extubated shortly after arriving to MICU, but
require pulmonary toilet via suctioning to be continued at
rehab.
.
# Altered mental status: On [**2159-9-4**] in early AM, pt described as
"obtunded" & non responsive per notes in chart, compared to
previously improving MS.  BP at the time of MS change 110/60's.
Emergent head CT done, which showed no change.  For duration of
admission, mental status improved where he would open his eyes
to voice, speak a few words, and move his R extremities (pt has
expected dense left hemiplegia). No toxic or metabolic cause of
his MS change was discovered besides mucus plugging and possible
pneumonia.  Pt expected to have slow course of improvement for
MS change [**12-29**] ICH.
.
# ICH: ICH slightly improved on repeat head CT on [**9-4**]. Pt
continued on levetiracetam and was instructed to follow up with
neurosurgery as an outpatient.  Pt was instructed to remain off
clopidogrel but was restarted on ASA 81mg daily for CAD.
.
# HTN: Pt required multiple anti-HTN agents during his
admission, including nicardipine, metoprolol, lisinopril, and
hydralazine.  Per neurosurgery, pt was instructed to maintain
SBP with no specific requirement, and was continued on
metoprolol 75mg PO Q8H.
.
# CAD: Pt was restarted on ASA 81mg daily per neurosurgery
recommendations.
.
# Fevers: Pt became febrile on [**8-23**] & continued to have fevers
~daily through [**8-29**].  He was started on vanco and zosyn for
empiric tx of pneumonia as CXR showed retro-cardiac opacity.
CSF was negative (showed 1+ PMNs, negative Gram-stain and cx).
Urine cx's negative.  Intermittent low grade fevers considered
likely [**12-29**] ICH, as he completed a full abx course for PNA.  Pt
was afebrile x24hrs at discharge.
.
# Nutrition: Pt was unable to swallow food due to his mental
status and received a post-pyloric Dobhoff via IR placement.
Tube feeds were begun with no complications.
