Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38277**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis and confusion for
one day.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old man with history of gastric
adenocarcinoma s/p resection in [**2136**], diabetes, hyperlipidemia
and hypertension presents one day after experiencing sub-sternal
chest pain. He states that he was in [**Country 2045**] 2 weeks ago when he
developed headache, abdominal pain and decreased oral inake. He
subsequently traveled to [**State 108**] and was in the care of family
when he describes experiencing severe sub-sternal chest pain
that began yesterday at 4PM with radiation to left arm and left
jaw, which he decribes as "very uncomfortable," and was
associated with palpitations, nausea and diaphoresis. Patient
was also noted by family members to be confused and have
difficulty ambulating. He lay in bed the rest of the day without
significant relief. This afternoon at 1 PM, the patient
continued to describe chest discomfort and was flown from
[**State 108**] to [**Location (un) 86**] where he was immediately [**Last Name (un) 4662**] the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T:96.7 BP:102/77 HR:86 RR:20
SpO2:100% on 2L. He received 324mg of Aspirin, 80mg of Lipitor,
20mg of Lasix IV, 4.5g of Zosyn IV and 1g Vancomycin IV. Head CT
revealed no acute intracranial process with bilateral parietal
lobe atrophy. EKG revealed 2-4mm STEs in Anterior Leads (V2-V4)
with reciprocal STDs in II, III and aVf consistent with STEMI.
Troponin was elevated to 5.04 with CK of 339 and CKMB of 8. The
was then admitted to the CCU for further management of his
STEMI.

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension
2. CARDIAC HISTORY: Has longstanding history of diabetes,
hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Also with "Valvular" heart
disease which was diagnosed many years ago while in [**Country 2045**].

Imaging:
Head CT ([**2145-2-23**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Widening of the extra-axial spaces overlying both parietal
lobes, likely due to atrophy
.
Pa/Lat CXR ([**2145-2-23**]):
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
effusions.
Patchy opacities in both lung bases may reflect atelectasis.

Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior
septum, anterior wall, lateral walls and apical segments. The
apex is dyskinetic. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be
excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
moderate ([**12-27**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a very small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent
with proximal LAD ischemia/infarction. Diastolic dysfunction.
Cannot exclude LV thrombus. Mild to moderate mitral and aortic
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2137-3-11**], wall motion abnormalities are new. The
degrees of aortic and mitral regurgitation have increased.
.
RUQ U/S ([**2145-2-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. No
evidence of
biliary obstruction.
2. Minimal sludge within a distended gallbladder. Specific signs
of acute
cholecystitis are not seen, however, if there is high clinical
concern for
acute cholecystitis, a Gallbladder HIDA scan can be obtained for
further
evaluation.
.
CT Abdomen and Plevis ([**2145-2-26**]):
Findings consistent with acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall
distention
with layering high-density sludge, pericholecystic fluid and
stranding, all indicative of acute cholecystitis given patient's
clinical picture. No other cause for acute infectious
inflammatory response identified on CT.
.
RUQ U/S ([**2145-2-28**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Collapsed gallbladder with cholecystostomy tube in place.
2. No intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
3. Liver vessels patent.
4.
