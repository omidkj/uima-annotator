History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with recent admission from [**Date range (1) 8677**] for
upper GI bleed secondary to duodenal ulcer, discharged to [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab. She was found at rehab incontinent of large amounts of
melena and BRBPR with clots. On last admission, EGD revealed
duodenal ulcer s/p epinephrine injection, clipping, and thermal
therapy. EGD x 2 given re bleed. HR at rehab was 105, systolic
BP 90s. Patient was lightheaded and developed bright red blood
per rectum and clots.
.
On arrival to ED patient was having active BRBPR, BP as low as
77/37, HR 110. HCT 22.3 She was transfused 2 units of RBCs, and
cross matched 4 units. 1 unit of FFP ordered. 1 liter NS given
with return of SBP to 100. GI was notified and recommended ICU
admission.
.
In the ICU patient alert, and interacts though with noted
conjunctival palor. Denies CP, shortness of breath, or abdominal
pain. Endorses some weakness that began earlier today, but has
since resolved. No nausea, says she vomited x1 on the way to the
hospital. Though no blood in her emesis. States visiting nurse
noticed blood in her stool and was concerned given hx therefore
sent her to the ED. Patient unable to relate details of earlier
today.  Intubated for procedure, complicated by hypotension and
respiratory distress.  Question of reintubation, and thus on
BiPAP.  Having active melena.  No more interventions per GI
other than surgery.  Melana now improved.  Got lasix and prn
morphine.  Comfortable.  Currently DNR/DNI without esclation.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with known duodenal ulcer s/p EGD injection, endoclip,
and thermal therapy one week prior to admission, presented with
BRBPR and melena.
.
#  GI bleed: Hct 22 on admission secondary to duodenal ulcer,
that has previously since been clipped and injected. Patient
presented to ED with active BRBPR and hyptension, given 2 units
pRBCs and 1 liter NS. In ICU additional unit pRBC given and
continued to be hypotension. NG lavage with bright red blood.
Patient was electively intubated for upper endoscopy which
demonstrated ulcer at the junction of first part of and second
part of the duodenum which was then endoclipped and injection.
GI recommended if further bleeding would need surgical/IR
intervention. Patient and family did not want further aggressive
intubation. On transfer to the floor patient is tachycardic and
tachypneic. GI stated that the plan was that if patient
continued to bleed that she would need surgery, however patient
and family have declined this intervention so that plan is to
pursue non-aggressive care.  ON transfer patient advanced to
full diet and tolerated it well. Hematocrit on the floor
remained stable. Patient was maintained on IV PPi [**Hospital1 **] with
active type and screen and two large bore IVs.
.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.9, however Cr on
admission 1.6 which improved to 1.5. UA suggestive of UTI with
urine culture with gram + bacteria, urine culture with
enterococcus that is sensitive to ciprofloxacin.  Patient was
treated with ciprofloxacin and this is to be continued on
discharge (confirmed with microbiology lab that enterococcus
that was isolated is indeed sensitive to ciprofloxacin).
Nephrotoxins were avoided.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC 29.2 on admission which trended down to 21
which is patient's baseline. Patient has known MDS, and
persistent leukocytosis. On last admission, WBC between 19 and
28. Patient had infectious work-up initially because hypotensive
in the ICU. Patient had one blood culture drawn which is still
no growth to date on day of discharge. UA demonstrates [**7-5**]
WBCs, trace LE.  Culture with gram + bacteria, enteroccos. No
Evidence on chest x-ray of infiltrate.  Patient has been
afebrile with no other localizing symptoms. UTI treated  with
ciprofloxacin as above.
.
# Hypertension: Patient has a history of HTN, on metoprolol as
outpatient. Patient was previously hypotensive in the ICU so
beta blocker was held in teh setting of GI bleed, once
stabilized was discharged back on outpatient be
