Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiopulmonary arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pulmonary intubation
central line placement


History of Present Illness:
78yo male with history of COPD found by nursing home staff to be
unresponsive.
.
The patient was in his usual state of health until yesterday
when he went into atrial fibrillation with shortness of breath.
He was treated with propanolol, digoxin, prednisone, and
azithromycin but looked somewhat worse this morning.  Shortly
afterwards, he was found to be unresponsive.  A code blue was
called and CPR was initiated at 1035am.  It is unclear if he was
wearing is oxygen prior to this event. AED applied and delivered
a shock at 1038am with CPR afterwards.  EMS arrived at 1040am
and CPR was stopped, patient with agonal breathing and
bradycardic rhythm.  Patient intubated, given epinephrine and
atropine, and taken to the ambulance at 1044am, which
transported him to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital.  He was thought to be down for
about 10 minutes before ACLS was initiated.
.
On arrival to OSH, central line was placed and he was started on
levophed and given amiodarone load and hydrocortisone 100mg IV.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was intubated and sedated.
Post-arrest team consulted and ArticSun protocol was initiated.
Head CT demonstrated no acute process.  Patient transferred to
CCU for further management.

TTE [**2-13**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There

cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened

moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right

valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN- 78yo male with history of COPD found to be
unresponsive s/p cardiopulmonary arrest.
.
# Cardiopulmonary arrest- Unclear etiology at this time but
thought [**2-8**] severe hypoxia at rehabilitation causing a possible
VF or PEA event. Patient with no known coronary artery disease
and extensive history of COPD. EKG on arrival to hospital
demomstrated LAD, RBBB, STD V1-V4, TWI aVL, V4-V5.  Previous EKG
([**1-18**]) revealed RBBB and left axis deviation. Other contributing
factors are new medications (digoxin, propanolol) and
bradycardic-induced VT/VF is also possible in this situation.
Given history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale
is a definite possibility. He had no further episodes of
bradycardia or arrhythmia on telemetry and was aggressively
diursed to prevent further severe hypoxia. At d
