Service:  MED


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right arm pain, chest pain, hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old man
with a history of mild dementia, severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, nursing home resident, status post crush
injury to his right arm twenty years ago for which he
underwent a right brachial bypass surgery, who was noted to
have a cold, painful right upper extremity on [**2153-5-19**] at
the nursing home. At this time, he was also with some
complaint of chest pain. The patient was treated with
aspirin, morphine and Lovenox. He presented to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Department where he
was seen by Vascular Surgery who recommended starting him on
heparin for questionable arterial clot and vascular
insufficiency. The patient was also seen by the Cardiology
service in the Emergency Department who did a bed side
echocardiogram, which showed no definite thrombus in his left
atrium. In the Emergency Room, his vital signs were as
follows:  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 90, blood pressure
98/palp, 96 percent on two liters nasal cannula. His [**Known lastname **]
blood cell count was 16.3. The patient was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2153-5-19**] for a labile blood
pressure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction two years ago. Chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease on home O2 requirement, dementia, bilateral
bolus pemphigoid, history of seizures, bilateral THR, status
post right arm bypass of brachial artery twenty years ago.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Imdur 30 mg q d.
2. Prednisone 7.5 mg q d.
3. Theophylline 200 mg q d.
4. Vitamin B-12.
5. Multivitamin.
6. Lovastatin 20 mg q d.
7. Tetracycline 600 mg b.i.d.
8. Ativan 0.5 mg t.i.d.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location (un) 18437**]. He has
a son and daughter who are both involved in his medical care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 119,
blood pressure 120/70, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 95
percent on four liters nasal cannula. HEENT:  Poor dentition.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. Extraocular
movements intact. Chest:  Bilateral diffuse rhonchi. Moving
air well. Cardiovascular:  Distant cardiac sounds. Normal S1,
S2, tachycardiac but with regular rhythm. Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, no pulsatile masses. Extremities:
Multiple erosions on his lower extremities, nonpalpable
pulses throughout. His right arm was blue in color with pale,
[**Known lastname **] fingertips. No pulse was Dopplerable. A pulse was
Dopplerable at his right axilla. His left arm was oozing
serosanguinous fluid. It was red in color.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2153-5-19**] for persistent hypotension
on the floor. The cause of his hypotension was unknown and
because the patient did have an elevated [**Known lastname **] blood cell
count, he was treated with empiric antibiotics; vancomycin,
levofloxacin and Flagyl. The goal was to keep his mean
arterial pressures greater than 60. He received 250 cc
intravenous fluid boluses to help accomplish this. He was
also started on Neo-Synephrine. With this, his pressures
improved. His urine output remained somewhat stable at
approximately 25 cc per hour. He was seen by Vascular
Surgery. The patient underwent an angiogram through the left
femoral artery, which revealed that his twenty year old
bypass graft on his right arm was completely occluded. The
patient's arm remained cool and cold and mildly tender. His
pain was controlled well with morphine. The heparin drip was
continued. Because the patient had likely ischemia greater
than twenty-four hours, the chances of him recovering
function of his right hand was minimal, thus, a surgical
procedure to reestablish flow was not indicated. The options
included amputation and/or pain control as the patient's
overall function was deteriorating.

The patient became volume overloaded during this hospital
course with the normal saline boluses in the setting of
underlying congestive heart failure. He was seen by the
Palliative Care team and at the time of discharge, the
consensus of the Medical Intensive Care Unit team was to
discharge the patient back to [**Location (un) 18437**] where he was to
receive palliative care.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Poor.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Location (un) 18437**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Right arm ischemia secondary to graft occlusion.

Dementia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Morphine elixir 2.5 mg sublingual q four hours.
2. Morphine elixir 2.5 mg q two hours p.r.n. acute pain.
3. Ativan 0.5-1.0 mg sublingual q 2-4 hours p.r.n. agitation.
4. Tylenol 650 mg p.r.n. fever.
5. Dulcolax suppository p.r.n.
6. Scopolamine 1.5 mg transdermal patch q 72 hours p.r.n.
   secretions.

Antibiotic therapy was discontinued as there was no clear
indication of infection.
