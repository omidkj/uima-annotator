ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Bicuspid aortic valve and aortic
stenosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Bicuspid aortic valve and aortic stenosis.
2.  Status post aortic valve replacement with
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] valve.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
woman with a known congenital bicuspid aortic valve who has
now developed a critical stenosis.  She presents with a
presyncopal episode.

The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2123-12-5**] which demonstrated an increased peak aortic gradient of
77 mmHg.  Following a second presyncopal episode, the patient
underwent cardiac catheterization in [**2124-1-5**] which
showed a calculated aortic valve area of 0.7 cm2 and a
relatively preserved ejection fraction of 50%.

The patient subjectively reports progressive fatigue and mild
dyspnea on exertion times several months.  No shortness of
breath, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or
orthopnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Bicuspid aortic valve.
 2.  Asthma.
 3.  Factor [**Doctor First Name 81**] deficiency.
 4.  Hypertension.
 5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 6.  Polymyalgia rheumatica.
 7.  Osteoarthritis.
 8.  Status post appendectomy.
 9.  Status post left knee arthroscopy.
10.  Status post left donor nephrectomy.
11.  Status post tubal ligation.
12.  Status post incisional hernia repair.
13.  Left bundle-branch block.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN (gives swelling).  CONTRAST DYE (gives
hives).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Prednisone 6 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Fosamax 70 mg p.o. every Thursday.
 3.  Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.

 6.  Advair as needed.
 7.  Vitamin E.
 8.  Vitamin C.
 9.   Calcium.
10.  Multivitamin supplement.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was an
elderly woman in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Sclerae were anicteric.  The throat
was clear.  The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or
masses.  The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm
with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, without masses or organomegaly.
Extremities were warm.  Not cyanotic and not edematous times
four.  Neurologic examination was intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Admission
laboratories revealed complete blood count with a white blood
cell count of 9.1, hematocrit was 35.9, and platelets were
311.  Chemistries revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 4,
chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was
16, creatinine was 0.7, and blood glucose was 108.  ALT was
37, AST was 26, alkaline phosphatase was 56, total bilirubin
was 0.2.  Prothrombin time was 12, INR was 1, and partial
thromboplastin time was 37.3.  Urinalysis was negative.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed no acute process.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for semi-elective
aortic stenosis repair.

Preoperatively, the patient was evaluated for her factor [**Doctor First Name 81**]
deficiency and was cleared by the Hematology/Oncology Service
in order for surgery.  They investigated the past records
surrounding her past surgeries; including her donor
nephrectomy as well as knee arthroscopy, and made the
suggestion for a bioprosthetic valve to be preferential.
They also remarked that postoperative bleeding may be a
significant complication.  They did note, however, that she
had tolerated her past surgeries very well.

On [**2124-2-1**], the patient underwent aortic valve
replacement (minimally invasive) with a 21-mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] valve.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with Levophed and propofol
drips.  There was some bleeding in the case, and the patient
was transfused 9 units of fresh frozen plasma and 1 unit of
packed red blood cells in the operating room.

In the Unit, the patient was started on a nitroglycerin drip
and propofol was increased.  The patient was extubated in the
evening on postoperative day zero.

On postoperative day one, the patient had her Nipride drip
weaned off as well as beginning moving to the chair with
assistance.  Here, it was noted that she had an approximately
20-beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was asymptomatic
and spontaneously resolved.  The patient was sleeping while
this occurred.

On the following days on the floor, the patient continued to
work with Physical Therapy in regaining her strength and
mobility.

On the evening on postoperative day three, the patient had
another short 7-beat run of ventricular tachycardia.  Again,
she was sleeping and symptomatic.  Cardiology was consulted
for evaluation and had no changes in management to recommend.
The patient stayed on the floor and worked again with
Physical Therapy and was ambulating quite well.

On the evening on postoperative day six, the patient again
had two short runs of ventricular tachycardia of
approximately 6 beats and 4 beats while she was sleeping.
The patient was clinically asymptomatic.  The
Electrophysiology Service was consulted and had no further
recommendations.  They stressed only continuing beta blockade
with metoprolol as we were doing.

On the evening on postoperative day seven, the patient had a
short run of supraventricular tachycardia.  Again, the
patient was asymptomatic.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On postoperative day eight, the
patient was discharged to home tolerating a regular diet,
adequate pain control on oral pain medications, and having no
more presyncopal events.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Physical examination on
discharge revealed the patient was in no acute distress.  The
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No sternal
click.  No drainage from the incision site.  A regular rate
and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  There was 1+
pedal edema bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  Laboratories on
discharge revealed complete blood count with white blood cell
count of 11, hematocrit was 31.6, and platelets were 333.
Chemistry panel revealed sodium was 141, potassium was 4.7,
chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 30, blood urea nitrogen was
19, creatinine was 0.9, and blood glucose was 91.   Magnesium
was 2.1.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Percocet 5/325 p.o. as needed.
 3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 4.  Prednisone 6 mg p.o. q.d.
 5.  Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
 6.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. (times seven days).
 7.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. (times seven
days).
 8.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 9.  Combivent 1 to 2 puffs inhaled q.4-6h. as needed.
10.  Oxazepam 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. as needed.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home with [**Hospital6 3429**].

DISCHARGE DIET:  Discharge diet is cardiac.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient should follow up with Cardiology (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
in one to two weeks.
2.  The patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in four weeks;
address the need for diuretics and cardiac medications.
