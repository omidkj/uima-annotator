Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
RLL nodule

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VATS right lower lobe superior segmentectomy


History of Present Illness:
 60-
year-old woman, with a significant history of smoking and
weight loss, who has been found to have a 1.7 cm ground-glass
spiculated nodule within the right lower lobe. She underwent
metastatic workup which demonstrated mild avidity within the
lesion but no FDG uptake elsewhere. An MRI of the brain
showed no evidence of metastasis. A short-term follow-up CT
scan showed no change within the lesion. We discussed her
case at the thoracic oncology multi-disciplinary conference,
and it was the consensus of group that we should move forward
with surgical resection. Therefore, due to the patient's poor
pulmonary function, we elected to do a segmentectomy versus a
right lower lobectomy should it end up being a lung cancer.
