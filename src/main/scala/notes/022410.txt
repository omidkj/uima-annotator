History of Present Illness:
55 y/o M with hx of hep C, s/p transplant in [**Location (un) **] 15 years
ago, now with decompensated cirrhosis. On the transplant list
here. Pt found unresponsive today. Initially went to OSH where
he was found to have coffee ground lavage and guiac positive
stools, with questionable GI bleed. In fulminant hepatic
failure. Intubated and started on pressors at OSH and tranferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In the ED, patient was requiring four pressor
support and had low saturations in the 60s on 100% FiO2
intubation. Was given vanco and zosyn and 1 u FFP and 1 u PRBCs.
Bedside echo was done. Eval was consistent with sepsis.
.
Of note, last week he had a cardiac catheterization at an OSH to
work up a cardiomyopathy. Was noted to have a growing hematoma
in his thighs per wife's history. Then the last three days
started feeling unwell. Was unresponsive at home this morning.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient is intubated and sedated.
He had saturations in the 50s. Had bruising on both legs. Hands
and feet were cool with difficult to palpate but dopplerable
pulses. His BP was in the 60s on max levo, vasopressin, neo.

Wet Read imaging:
CT chest, abd and pelvis -
- dense RUL consolidation concerning for aspiration or pneumonia

- mulitifocal pneumonia
- ascites
- splenomegaly
- bilateral moderate pleural effusion
.
CXR -
Cardiomegaly with mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
may represent CHF vs. fluid overload.
.
CT head -
no acute abnormality
.
FAST scan - negative
.
Echo:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
basal to mid inferior hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The estimated
cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o M 55 y/o M with hx of recurrent Hep C cirrhosis after
transplant failure, immunesuppressed, now presents unresponsive.

.
# [**Name (NI) 21020**] - unclear etiology, sepsis v. hypovolemic v.
cardiogenic. Most likely sepsis in setting of immunesuppression,
possible sources are ascites or lung or infected hematoma s/p
cath two weeks ago. Has elevated lactate and severe acidosis.
Bedside echo in ED showed mild hypokinesis, so unlikely
cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **]. Could be hypovolemic due to GI bleed.  Most
likely etiology is infected hematoma.  Received news from OSH
that [**5-14**] culture bottles positive for GNRs.  Treated with abx
and pressors.  Severe acidosis and could not maintain BPs.
Expired on pressors.
.
# Sepsis - no known source at this time, will pan culture and
follow up findings.  Empirically started vanco and zosyn and
clindmycin (for synergy and decreased toxin production) for
broad spectrum coverage and covered fungal sepsis as he is
immunesuppressed, with caspofungin.  He expired before getting
fungal treatment
.
# Respiratory failure - intubated, not oxygenating well with O2
sats in the 50s and 60s, frothy sputum coming out through ET
tube.  Prob from pulm edema, expired.  Blood gases showed severe
acidosis and poor oxygenation.
.
# GI bleed - coffee ground lavage, possible bleed in setting of
varices in liver disease and coagulopathy.  Hcts stable for the
few hours he was in our MICU.
.
# Hep C / cirrhosis - longstanding hx of Hep C, s/p liver
transplant now with rejection and cirrhosis.  Liver team
followed and talked with family extensively about the infeciton.

.
# DIC - likely in DIC, expired before cyroprecipitate could be
given.
.
# ARF - creatinine 3.1 today from a baseline around 1.0 last
month. Likely in setting of hypoperfusion with gradual prerenal
failure v. ATN after [**Month/Day (4) **].
.
# Leukopenia - unclear reason, consumed in DIC v. med effect
.
# Thrombocytopenia - in setting of liver disease
.
# Diabetes - hypoglycemic upon presentation, frequent
fingersticks and D50 as needed. Received several amps in the ED
so may have hyperglycemia throughout night.
.
# Pt expired due to overwhelming sepsis.  Time of death 820 pm.
Family at bedside.
