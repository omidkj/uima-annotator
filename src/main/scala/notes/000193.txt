CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Malaise.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38707**] is an 81-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, obesity,
apnea, obesity, peripheral vascular disease, status post AAA
repair, status post right BKA who presents with "feeling
terrible" and diarrhea for one week.  He presented with these
symptoms from an outside hospital.  The patient complained of
leg pain, back pain, shoulder pain in the Emergency Room.  He
denied any shortness of breath or chest pain.  He reports
minor diaphoresis and low grade temperatures.  In the
blood pressure of 78, heart rate of 27-45, he received
Atropine and Dopamine and was intubated, had a Swan Ganz
catheter placed and was sent to the ICU.  It was found that
he had a troponin of 19.6 with a CK of 280 and a peak MB of
14.5.  Of note, an echocardiogram was done on [**12-21**] which
revealed normal left ventricular function.  The patient had a
CT scan of the chest and abdomen which revealed no evidence
of pulmonary embolism or ischemic bowel, however, chest CT
had evidence of bilateral pneumonia right greater than left.
He was started on Levofloxacin, Ceftazidime.  His creatinine
and potassium were also found to be elevated, likely due to
acute renal failure from dehydration secondary to the
diarrhea.  The patient was given Kayexalate and gentle
hydration.  He was also started on Solu-Medrol for suspected
adrenal insufficiency.  On [**1-25**] the patient failed ventilator
wean secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Since the
patient had a recent non Q wave MI and may have worsening
coronary artery disease, he was sent to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, on home oxygen three liters per minute by initial
cannula.  2) Coronary artery disease with cath in [**2109**] that
revealed normal EF with inferior base hypokinesis, RCA was
totally occluded and had collaterals from left to right.
Echocardiogram on [**12-21**] revealed normal left ventricular
function, mild AS, aortic insufficiency, LVH and trace MR.
3) Obstructive sleep apnea for which he does not tolerate
C-pap.  4) Obesity.  5) History of AAA repair five years ago,
right BKA secondary to compartment syndrome.  Outpatient

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with his wife, retired from the Air
Force.  Smokes 1?????? packs of cigarettes per day and drinks
alcohol socially.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals on admission, temperature 97.9,
pulse 54, respiratory rate 14, blood pressure 136/62, satting
97%.  He was on assist control with total volume of 800, rate
14, PEEP 8, 55% FIO2.  In general he was in no acute
distress.  Cardiovascular, regular but bradycardic, had a
grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal
border.  Had S3 heard at the apex.  Respiratory, lungs were
clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes heard.  Abdomen
with good bowel sounds, soft, nontender, non distended.
Extremities, had a right BK, lower extremities were warm, he
had 1+ distal lower extremity pulses, no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.7, hematocrit 30.5, platelet
count 81,000, PTT 15.3, PTT 20.9, INR 1.2, sodium 136,
potassium 4.4, chloride 103, CO2 24, BUN 47, creatinine 1.2,
glucose 110, CK 33, albumin 2.7, calcium 8.0, phosphorus 4.6,
magnesium 1.7.  Uric acid 8.9.  ABG 7.39, PCO2 47, PAO2 91.
Chest x-ray showed cardiovascular enlargement, bilateral
pleural effusions and patchy opacities in inferior perihilar
region consistent with CHF, probable left pleural effusion.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, Q's in
lead 3 and AVF, ST depressions in V3 through V6.  CT of the
abdomen and pelvis from the outside hospital revealed liver,
pancreas and spleen were normal. There are three gallstones.
There are simple cysts in both kidneys, no evidence of
ischemic bowel.  CT of the chest also at the outside hospital
revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism but evidence of
bilateral pneumonia, right greater than left.  Here, at [**Hospital1 1444**] cardiac catheterization
revealed a 70% osteal lesion of left main with 100% occlusion
of RCA with collaterals from the left.  His LAD and
circumflex revealed no significant obstructive disease.
Cardiovascular surgery was then notified to evaluate the
patient for CABG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  Cardiovascular surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] to
perform a possible CABG on the patient.  They requested a TTE
which revealed that he had a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 55%, his AV gradient was 23 mmHg with a mean
gradient of 12.  Aortic valve area is 1.72 cm sq which is
consistent with mild aortic valvular stenosis.  His left
atrium was mildly dilated.  He had moderate left ventricular
hypertrophy.  AV leaflets were markedly thickened.  He had a
mild 1+ AR and mild to moderate MR.  Cardiovascular surgeons
declined to operate on the patient since he was at very high
risk of complications given his severe COPD, severe
peripheral vascular disease and mild aortic stenosis.  He was
taken back to the cardiac catheterization lab where his left
main lesion was successfully stented.  He will need repeat
catheterization in three months to evaluate the patency of
the stent.  When he was extubated he became hypertensive and
tachycardic with a rhythm consistent with multifocal atrial
tachycardia.  A combination of ACE inhibitor, calcium channel
blocker, low dose beta blocker, and nitrates successfully
controlled his hypertension and tachycardia.

2. Respiratory:  Pulmonary records were obtained from outside
hospital which revealed that the pain did not have any
evidence of interstitial lung disease by a CT scan which was
performed last year.  A repeat CT scan was performed on this
admission which confirmed these findings.  He was then
started on Atrovent, Serevent and Flovent and Albuterol prn
for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The
patient then tolerated a pressor support wean and was then
successfully extubated.

3.  ID:  The patient remained afebrile for his entire
hospital stay.  All cultures that were obtained were negative
for any signs of infection.  Once the patient finished a 7
day course of Levaquin and Ceftazidime started at the outside
hospital for his pneumonia, antibiotics were discontinued.
He had no further signs of infection for the rest of his
hospital stay.

4.  Heme:  The patient was found to be thrombocytopenic on
admission.  Heparin induced antibodies were sent and were
found to be negative.  Eventually his thrombocytopenia had
resolved by the time of discharge.

5.  Endocrine:  The stress dose steroids started at outside
hospital were weaned to off.

6. Gastrointestinal:  He was continued on tube feeds until he
was transferred to the medicine floor.  A speech and swallow
consult was obtained which revealed that he had no signs of
aspiration. The patient was started on a cardiac diet.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to rehab facility.
