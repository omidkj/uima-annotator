Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
xfer for ICD placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiV/ICD placement on [**8-14**]


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73 year old woman with a history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy EF 15%, pulm HTN, AF (not on coumadin) and
schizophrenia who is here for CHF management and BiV ICD
placement.  She had originally presented to [**Hospital6 33**]
on [**8-6**].
.
At [**Hospital3 **] BNP was 6300.   It was managed with digoxin
0.125, lisinopril 2.5mg, and carvedilol 3.125mg twice daily.
She was diuresed 2L and her Cr rose to 1.6.  She was seen by
[**Doctor First Name 28239**] [**Doctor Last Name 13177**] there and the decision was made to have a BiV
ICD placed.
.
Arrived at [**Hospital1 18**], where she was noted to be hypoxic and
orthopneic.  Also complaining of abdominal pain.  She got 40
lasix, however was only net negative 300 because of significant
fluid intake.
.
She went down for procedure on admission but was unable to lie
flat therefore she was transferred to CCU for diuresis and
further management.  Prior to arrival in the CCU, patient
received 60 mg of IV Lasix. Upon arrival to the CCU, she was
able to lie flat with O2 sat of 95%.

[**8-10**] Echo: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Tissue velocity imaging
E/e' is elevated  (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).  The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with marked elevation of left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated LV cavity with severe global
systolic
dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
[**8-10**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior
chest radiographs:  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
severe accompanied by mild pulmonary edema, small bilateral
pleural effusions and mediastinal vascular engorgement. No
pneumothorax. Fibrillator pads project over the heart.
.
Micro: Blood cultures negative, Urine cultures negative.
Stool culure positive for Clostridium difficile

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 68525**] is a 73 year old with multiple medical problems
including non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who presented from an OSH
with pulmonary edema and plan for BiV ICD placement which was
put on hold given hypoxia prior to procedure.
.
Cardiac:
Pump: Ms. [**Known lastname 68525**] has a history of recurrent NYHA stage IV CHF
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for BiV pacer/ICD placement in the
hope that it would help to manage her refractory CHF (EF
15-20%).  An echo was done on [**8-10**] which showed a moderately
dilated LV cavity with severe global systolic dysfunction,
moderate mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Prior to the procedure the patient was unable to lie flat due to
hypoxia/ pulmonary edema and was transferred to the CCU for
diuresis.  While in the CCU she received multiple doses of 120mg
IV lasix with resultant good urine output.  Spironolactone was
added as well, however her creatinine began to rise and her Na
and K became elevated.  Spironolactone was then held and she was
given a small amount of free water to normalize her sodium
levels.  As her oxygenation had improved, she underwent
[**Company 1543**] ICD, Concerto C154DWK placement on [**8-14**].  Given her
low EF, the device was not tested post-procedure.  She developed
a hematoma over the site of ICD placement.  A pressure dressing
was applied to the site to prevent further hematoma.  A line was
delineated around the hematoma site to monitor for increasing
size of hematoma, which was not noted.  She was intubated
electively for the procedure and returned to the CCU with the
ETT tube in place.  She was successfully extubated the following
morning and was started on a low dose of captopril and
eventually switched to lisinopril 2.5mg daily.  Carvedilol was
also started and was well tolerated.  On [**8-17**] she was
transferred to a regular floor.  Her wound remained stable.  She
will follow up with EP Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 68526**] for an ICD check 1wk from
discharge.  She was discharged on an aspirin and statin.  The
patient denied any lightheadedness, chest pain, site tenderness
or palpitations.
.
Rhythm: The patient presented in atrial fibrillation, however
she was not on coumadin for unclear reasons.  After BiV
placement, it was felt that anticoagulation was unnecessary.
.
Renal: The patient presented with renal insufficiency, likely
secondary to her diabetes mellitus.  Her creatinine increase was
reported at [**Hospital1 34**] likely due to diuresis.  A UA done on admission
was negative for infection.  She had minimal hematuria which
resolved after her foley was d/c'd.  Her creatinine peaked at
2.1, however on the day of discharge it had normalized to 1.1
which appeared to be her baseline.  She had adequate urine
output.
.
Pulm: As above the patient was electively intubated for ICD
placement.  She was successfully extubated and was satting well
on RA with no shortness of breath.  CXR on [**8-18**] showed no
interval change, mild pulmonary edema consistent with CHF.
.
ID:  The patient was placed on vancomycin for 5 days post ICD
placement.  In addition, as she developed diarrhea a C. diff
toxin was sent which was positive.  She was started on a 14 day
course of flagyl and was placed on contact precautions.
She remained afebrile and her WBC count remained wnl.
.
Hematologic:  Ms. [**Known lastname 68525**] had a gradual decrease in platelet
count since admission (admission 118, low 81 on [**8-17**]).  Her
platelets had trended up to 171 p
