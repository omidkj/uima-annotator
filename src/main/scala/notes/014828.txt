Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1654**]
Chief Complaint:
decline in mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Resection of R cerebellar mass with placement of right
intraventricular, occipital drain. Subsequent placement of right
anterior ventricular drain.

History of Present Illness:
85 yo male with atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD, CHF, COPD
and a hx of prostate ca who initially presented to [**Hospital3 29818**] on [**2177-11-16**] with mild confusion, increasing SOB over
several days, unresponsive to his COPD medications and N, with
vomiting. His labs were significant for WBC 23.8 (diff 85N, 5B,
3 %lymph) INR 2.6, K 3.2, elevated creat 1.6 (up from baseline
1.3) and a trop of 0.2, CK 63, MB 2.6. His EKG was notable for a
RBBB but did not show any changes to prior. His CXR was notable
for RLL patchy infiltrate and LLL consolidation. An ABG showed
ph 7.55, pCO2 37, PO2 50. D-Dimer was negative. He was thought
to have a CAP with superimposed CHF and possible exacerbation of
his COPD. He was given albuterol nebs, lasix, solumedrol,
levaquin, morphine. On [**11-17**] he was was found to be increasingly
confused and noted to be exhibiting bizarre behavior. A head CT
was done and showed 5X2cm R cerebellar hemorrhage with mild mass
effect. 2u FFP, vi K, dilantin load and lasix and nitropaste for
edema associated with FFP transfusion. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Past Medical History:
1 Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin
2 CAD s/p CABG in [**2168**], s/p MI
3 CHF (Last Echo in '[**74**] showed right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension (63mm gradient) consistent with cor
pulmonale), mild mitral regurgitation. Low normal left
ventricular systolic function. EF 50-55%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Here, on the [**11-17**], the pt had a right cerebellar craniotomy
that revealed a cerebellar hemorrhage as well as a mass in the R
cerebellum. He had removal of mass and a placement of a right
intraventricular, occipital drain in OR. The pathology revealed
a poorly differentiated carcinoma most consistent with small
cell carcinoma, concerning for small ca of lung/ neuroendocrine
ca or less likely melanoma or lymphoma. He underwent CT of
chest/abd/pelvic. That revealed multiple mass lesions within the
liver, mediastinum, lung, pelvis, and left inguinal region,
concerning for diffuse metastatic disease. One large lesion
within the pelvis is contigous with the prostate, possible
exophytic prostate lesion or a metastatic focus invading into
the prostate. Also, bilateral pleural effusions were seen. The
occipital intraventricular drain was removed on the and a right
anterior ventricular drain placed on the [**11-18**], b/o a new
component of cerebellar hemorrhage involving the vermis. The pt
was extubated on the [**11-19**]. CT of the head showed stability of
the ICH over the next days. The pt's second drain was removed on
the [**11-26**]. The pt also received 5U of PRBC during his operation
and 4U of FFPs. He continued to improve in his mental status
although to remained with severe dysarthria and dystaxia due to
his cerebellar lesion and involvement of other cranial nerves
such as the hypoglossus.
The pt's prognosis was infaust. Further management of the
underlying cancer was discussed with the pt and he refused
radiation of chemotherapy and requested comfort care. This was
also in accordance to his living will. Palliative care and
social work were consulted for a meeting with all teams involved
in the pt's care and the family. It was decided to treat the pt
with comfort measures only. The pt died on the [**2177-12-1**] at
11.30am.
