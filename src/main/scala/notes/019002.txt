HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year-old
female with recent admission to [**Hospital 4415**]
with right empyema treated by chest tube and thrombolytic
therapy to pleural space subsequently transferred to [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital 13247**] Rehab on [**3-17**] for a cardiac rehab after
empyema therapy and diuresis for congestive heart failure,
community acquired pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin.

Of note during [**Hospital 4415**] admission had four
units of packed red blood cells transfused while on heparin.
Per report this was a retroperitoneal bleed, although we do
not have paperwork documenting this.  Today at [**Location (un) 511**]
[**Hospital 13247**] Rehab the patient had melanotic stools times two and
INR of 3.9 and was given fresh frozen platelets and
subcutaneous vitamin K.  Nasogastric lavage showed scant
coffee grounds. The patient was hemodynamically stable and
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].

syndrome with anemia on erythropoietin.  Macular
degeneration.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Piperacillin/tazobactam.

141/65.  Pulse 94.  Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygen saturation
92% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  Pupils sluggish.  Conjunctiva
and sclera normal.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Head
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Neck supple.  Kyphosis noted.  No
cervical lymphadenopathy.  Point of maximal impulse of heart
palpated.  Clear S1.  Distant S2.  No gallops.  Systolic
murmur 4 out of 6.  No friction rub.  Respirations symmetric
with normal effort.  Bronchial breath sounds in bases as well
as fine crackles.  No pleural rub.  Abdomen obese with normal
bowel sounds, soft to palpation.  No tympany.  No masses.
Liver and spleen within normal limits.  2+ radial pulses
without clubbing or cyanosis and normal capillary refill.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 148, potassium 3.6, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 36, BUN 33, creatinine 0.6, glucose 135, INR 2.4,
PTT 42, white blood cell count 13.8, hematocrit 26, platelets
209.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed in
the setting of Warfarin anticoagulation for atrial
fibrillation.  Warfarin was held.  The patient was given
vitamin K and fresh frozen platelets at the outside
institution.  She was given b.i.d. Protonix.  GI was
consulted and felt clinical picture was supportive of upper
GI or right colonic bleed in the setting of coagulopathy.
Recommended continued correction of coagulopathy and
hemodynamic support with proton pump inhibitor.  No
esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy as the patient was
clinically unstable.  The patient was continued on her
cardiac medications and nebulizers.  At 11:00 p.m. on [**3-22**] the patient became increasingly lethargic and had a blood
gas with a pH of 7.04, PCO2 151, PO2 49 on shovel mask.  The
patient was started on noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation with partial improvement in respiratory acidosis
and hypoxia.  Diuresis was performed with intravenous
furosemide with sluggish response.

Despite this therapy the patient was felt to be in a
situation where endotracheal intubation would be required to
maintain her respiratory status.  The [**Hospital 228**] health care
proxy Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 40570**] and the patient's brother [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 40571**] were contact[**Name (NI) **] and both affirmed that the patient
wished to avoid mechanical ventilatory support,
defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  After
appropriate time to allow the patient's family to consult
with the patient was maintained on noninvasive positive
pressure ventilation, the health care proxy affirmed the
wishes of the family that the patient would not want further
invasive measures and the patient's status was changed to
comfort measures only at 7:30 a.m. on [**3-24**].  Sentinel,
Ativan and an intravenous morphine sulfate drip were given
for comfort.  Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was
discontinued.  The patient expired secondary to respiratory
arrest at 9:05 a.m.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Respiratory arrest.
2.  Gastrointestinal bleed.

Family notified.  Post mortem examination declined by [**Name (NI) 1528**]
[**Name (NI) 40571**], brother.  [**Name (NI) **] medical examiner notification.
