ECG [**2160-7-11**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes which
are
non-specific. Low QRS voltages in the precordial leads. Compared
to the
previous tracing of [**2158-8-12**] there is no significant diagnostic
change.
TRACING #1

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS [**2160-7-11**]:
1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Basilar atelectasis, without evidence of pneumonia.
3. Trace pericardial fluid with fluid seen tracking in the
pericardial
recesses.
4. Moderate hiatal hernia, with associated atelectasis.
5. No acute intra-abdominal process identified to explain pain.
There is a
small amount of free pelvic fluid, without identifiable cause.
6. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
7. Questionable thickening of the endometrial cavity, with
possible fluid
within. A non-emergent pelvic ultrasound is recommended for
further
evaluation.
8. Extensive thoracolumbar degenerative change with associated
scoliotic
curvature. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions
identified.
9. Marked degenerative change in the right hip, with
bone-on-bone
articulation, subchondral cystic change and sclerosis.

CXR [**2160-7-11**]:
FINDINGS: There are bibasilar opacities likely related to low
lung volumes.
The lungs are clear with no focal consolidation, effusion, or
pneumothorax.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is a
moderate hiatal
hernia seen, similar in configuration compared with prior. There
is
kyphoscoliosis of the thoracic spine, with severe degenerative
changes
throughout.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute chest pathology.

2. Hiatal hernia, stable in appearance.

CXR [**2160-7-12**]:
FINDINGS: Again seen is a hiatal hernia. There are bilateral
pleural
effusions, left greater than right that have increased compared
to the study from the prior day. There is increased volume loss
at the left base. A small underlying infectious infiltrate on
the left cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION: Increasing effusions bilaterally and volume loss on
the left.

ECHO [**2160-7-12**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-2-27**],
the degrees of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary
hypertension have increased. The other findings are similar.

ECG [**2160-7-12**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Compared to tracing #1 there is no
significant diagnostic change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  79 yof admitted to the ICU for
hypotension, currently doing well.

# Hypotension: Pt was admitted to the ICU for hypotension to the
80's after receiving a dose of Morphine.  Pt said her blood
pressure usually drops significantly with opioid's.  She said
she told this to the doctors in the [**Name5 (PTitle) **], but it seems to have
gotten lost in translation.  Pt recovered from hypotensive
episode after getting levophed and was transferred to the unit.
Pt received fluids and was monitored.  Her status improved and
she was ruled out for MI, and PE.  On 2nd day of admission a
repeat CXR was done that showed a LLL infiltrate suggestive of
PNA.  The patient was transferred to the general medicine floor
and started on levofloxacin every other day.  The patient
remained stable and afebrile throughout the night and was
discharged on day 3 of hospitalization with a 10 day total
course of Abx, and follow up with her PCP.

# Tachycardia: Mild in the setting of hypotension, could be
reactive to hypovolemia with a component of anxiety.  The
patient had one episode of atrial fibrillation that resolved on
its own in the unit.  The patient was in sinus rhythm overnight
on the general medicine floor.

# Pleuritic chest pain: r/o for MI, PE and aortic dissection in
the ED.  Pain is not reproducible on exam, making
musculoskeletal less likely.  Pt was given Morphine for the
pain, but that caused her to become hypotensive. After that the
patient was treated with NSAIDs for the pain and given
guaifenesin to control her cough as it was believed to be
pleuritic irritation secondary to constant cough.  The patient's
pain decreased throughout the hospital course and she was
discharged with instructions to buy cough syrup at the local
pharmacy.

# Osteoarthrit
