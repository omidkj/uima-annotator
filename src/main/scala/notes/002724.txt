Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5134**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, AMS, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line


History of Present Illness:
(see MICU [**Location (un) **] note for full details)
50yoF with remote h/o PE, schizophrenia, anxiety, DMII, COPD,
and MSSA meningitis who was admitted to the MICU on [**1-5**] after
being found hypotensive (SBP 70s), hypoxic (80% on RA) and with
AMS at home. The entire story is unclear, but apparently the
patient became altered, slid off her chair, and was evidently
down for an extended period of time. She does not remember the
events.
.
Initially, the patient was resuscitated with 7L IVF, was found
to be in [**Last Name (un) **] and with rhabdomyolysis. CT head was negative. CXR
was suspicious for RLL infiltrate and broad-spectrum antibiotics
were started empirically. She did not require intubation. In the
unit, the patient was on levophed for < 24 hours. Hypoxia and
hypotension resolved with supportive care and Cr normalized with
IVF. Mental status also improved over the course of the past 2
days. Psychiatry was consulted in the unit given the patient's
history of psychiatric problems and concern for medication side
effect as the root cause of the patient's presentation. Given
the patient's history of PE, she was treated empirically with a
heparin drip, however this was stopped yesterday given the
resolution of hypoxia, tachycardia, and hypotension. LENIs were
negative for DVT bilaterally and TTE showed normal systolic
function.
.
Currently, the patient states that she feels better than her
normal self. She does not remember the events that led to her
hospitalization. She complains of R foot pain, left shoulder
pain (is scheduled for operation), and some worsened SOB over
baseline. Current VS are 97.1  91   125/67   18  94% on RA. The
patient states that she lives alone at home, ambulates with a
cane, and has [**Name Initial (MD) **] home RN and home health aide who assist her each
day. She is able to list her medications and doses. Her
psychiatrist is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12262**]. She denies overdosing on
medications at home or wanting to hurt herself.
Endorses cough with deep inspiration.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, shortness of breath, chest
pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

Blood and urine cultures: negative

CXR:
FINDINGS: A supine portable AP view of the chest was obtained.
The left
costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. A right internal
jugular
catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There has been interval
worsening of
moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. Hazy opacity at the
right lung base
may represent developing consolidation versus crowding of
vessels secondary to
low lung volumes. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax are
identified.
Surgical pins are noted in the left glenoid.
.
Normal Head CT
.
Echo:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
70%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2166-3-14**], no obvious change but the technically
suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive
comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y.o woman with history of PE and MSSA meningitis last year
complicated by osteomyelitis who presents today with change in
mental status, hypoxia, shock and rhabdomyelysis.
.
#Shock - Patient presented with hypotension, likely due to a
combination of hypovolemia and sepsis secondary to a pneumonia.
The patient responded to fluids and was on norepinephrine for
blood pressure support. Levophed weaned off and a-line d/c-ed.
Resolved. Patient was normotensive after transfer to the floor
and anti-hypertensives were slowly restarted.
.
#Respiratory failure/pneumonia - ABG showed a hypercarbic
respiratory failure and acute respiratory acidosis.  The patient
has a history of COPD and also has a urine tox screen that was
positive for opiates.  The patient did receive 1mg of narcan in
the emergency room, without any improvement.  It is possible
that the patient has a pneumonia that was exacerbating her COPD.
Did not require intubation. Patient was treated with 5-days of
ceftriaxone and azithromycin. For the 2 days prior to discharge,
oxygen saturations were >95% on RA.
.
#Change in mental status - Thought to be secondary to
hypercarbia, although potential contributing etiology may
include narcotic overdose or other medication side
effect/accumulation in renal failure. Mental status cleared in
the unit. Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was alert,
oriented, and able to recount her list of medications and health
problems. She was not able to relay the events that led to h
