Approved: MON [**2183-11-3**] 10:53 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate atherosclerotic calcification within the
intra-abdominal aorta
and descending aorta. Minimal calcification within the ascending
aorta.
Atherosclerotic disease within the coronary circulation and
aortic valve.

2. Extensive pneumobilia with aerosolized secretions and
dilatation noted
within the CBD of uncertain etiology. Calcified stones in the
distal CBD;
these findings can be better evaluated by MRCP if clinically
indicated. These
findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21402**] on [**2183-11-1**] at 8:30AM.
Correlation
with known patient's outside imaging and history is also
recommended.

3. Incompletely characterized exophytic right renal lesions
which do not meet
criteria for simple cysts. Per clinical note, these were
evaluated with
dedicated PET/CT which is not available for review.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
