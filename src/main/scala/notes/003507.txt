KUB [**2-1**]:
FINDINGS: Dilated small bowel in the lower abdomen measuring up
to 4.3 cm in diameter containing air-fluid levels on the upright
view. Findings concerning for small-bowel obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted from ED in good condition with the diagnosis of
small bowel obstruction.  He was given hemodialysis for an
elevated potassium.  His small bowel obstruction was treated
conservatively with IV hydration, PPI's, and nothing by mouth.
On HD2, the patient's ostomy began to put out stool and gas.  He
was advanced to a clear, then regular diet on HD3.  By HD 4 the
patient was comfortable eating a regular diet, having stool and
gas from his ostomy, without abdominal pain or distention.  He
was then deemed safe for discharge home. Of note, the patient
had a set of troponins that were drawn in the ED for the symptom
of epigastric pain. An EKG was normal, and the pt was
hemodynamically stable. Thus his troponin elevation was thought
to be due to his renal failure and not from cardiac ischemia. He
was restarted kept on coumadin throughout his hospitalization
and made sure his INR levels were therapeutic by his discharge,
as he came with subtherapeutic levels. He was discharged on
[**2-4**] with an INR of 3.0 and will closely follow-up his levels
with the coumadin clinic from the labs drawn at [**Month/Year (2) 2286**].
