Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3948**]

[**2162-2-11**]: Doboff feeding tube
[**2162-2-9**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration.
[**2162-2-6**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration
[**2162-2-5**]: Rigid bronchoscopy with black Dumon bronchoscope.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59-year-old female with h/o NSCLC, malignant
pleural effusion s/p pleurodesis, and nonmalignant pericardial
effusion, now presenting with increasing shortness of breath and
worsening cough for the past 10 days. Her cough was minimally
productive at first, but increased in production with slightly
blood-tinged sputum after starting Mucinex on her recent OSH
hospitalization. She also had some pleuritic chest pain with
persistent coughing, rated [**8-13**]. She otherwise denies fever,
chills, chest pain or palpitations.

Additionally, she recently had a G-tube placement about 3 weeks
ago at [**Hospital 931**] Hospital. Patient notes that it started
leaking
about 1 week ago. She returned to the hospital, at which point
the position of the G-tube was confirmed by her surgeons. But it
still continued to leak.

Of note, patient has also been having vaginal bleeding for the
past 2 weeks, worse in the beginning, but more recently improved
with only some spotting now. Previous CT abdomen/pelvis (done
about 5 weeks ago) had revealed a uterine fibroid, suspected as
a
possible cause for her menorrhagia. Her oncologist also suspects
metastasis and wants a biopsy done.

She was then admitted to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] hospital on [**2162-2-3**] to
the Internal Medicine service. After obtaining a pulmonology
consult by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], CT chest was done which revealed
occlusion of the right mainstem bronchus with associated
collapse
and consolidation of the right lobe with additional adjacent
loculated pleural effusion, stable pericardial effusion, and
bilateral renal masses. She was started on azithromycin and
ceftriaxone. She was also evaluated by GI (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], who
increased the tightness of the G-tube bumper to 4 cm and
recommended less water to be flushed after meds are given and to
palce the patient on her right side during the day to encourage
tube feeds to go from stomach to duodenum. Regarding her vaginal
bleeding, OB/Gyn consult was initiated.

Given her pulmonary status, patient is now being transferred
here
for further workup with bronchoscopy and possible stenting of
the
bronchus.

ROS: Positive for shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea on
exertion, abdominal pain, nausea, vaginal bleeding, bilateral
lower extremity edema, back pain and occasional constipation.
Negative for fever, chills, headache, vomiting, tingling,
numbness, seizures, loss of consciousness, chest pain,
palpitations or diarrhea

[**2162-2-7**]: CTA airway, No evidence of pulmonary embolus. Occlusion
of the right main stem bronchus as well as complete collapse of
the right lung. An underlying obstructive mass cannot be
excluded and further evaluation with bronchoscopy may be
helpful. Bilateral pleural effusions and a small pericardial
effusion.  Enlarged bilateral adrenal glands as well as an L4
lytic lesion, both concerning for metastasis. NG tube
malpositioned outside of the stomach body.
[**2162-2-8**]: CXR:  In comparison to study of [**2-7**], there are decreased
lung volumes and some increasing prominence of interstitial
markings, suggesting overhydration. Complete opacification of
the right hemithorax persists, consistent with the CT
demonstration of complete occlusion of the right mainstem
bronchus and complete collapse of the right lung.

[**2162-2-11**]: Abdominal film: NG tube tip coiled in the fundus of the
stomach,
[**2162-2-10**]: Barium Esophagus:  Markedly limited study, shows
aspiration as well as free passage contrast through the
esophagus into the stomach, without evidence of frank stricture.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 41033**] was admitted on [**2162-2-5**] for further evaluation of her
Stage IV NSCLC s/p chemo/XRT therapy now with malignant airway
obstruction. On [**2161-2-4**] she was taken to the operating room for
Rigid bronchoscopy, balloon dilation, tumor debridement and
therapeutic aspiration.  She was extubated in the OR monitor in
the PACU were she was re-intubated for hypoxia, bronch with
removal of a small blood clot partially obstructing the RUL.
She transferred to the SICU for further management. On [**2162-2-6**]
she had bronchoscopy with aspiration for the RMS & RUL.  She
given a fluid bolus for hypotension.  LENIS were negative for
DVT.  She was sucessfully extubated and diuresed with lasix. On
[**2161-2-6**] the CT airway revealed No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Occlusion of the right main stem bronchus as well as complete
collapse of the right lung.Bilateral pleural effusions and a
small pericardial effusion. Enlarged bilateral adrenal glands as
well as an L4 lytic lesion, both concerning for metastasis. NG
tube malpositioned outside of the stomach body. The G-tube was
removed secondary to placement in fascia. She transferred to the
floor and remained stable. She remained NPO and was maintained
on IV fluids. She was evaluated by GI for possible esophageal
stricture and feeding tube placement.  Pallative Care was
consulted and assisted with her pain control and transition to
hospice. On [**2161-2-9**] her INR was 1.5 she was given SL Vit k.  On
[**2162-2-11**] she underwent EGD which showed severe gastritis and
absence of GI motility.  A Doboff feeding tube was placed and
tube feeds were started per nutrition recommendations. Over the
course of her hospitalization she had multiple bronchoscopy for
muscus pluggings. On [**2162-2-12**] she was discharged to home with
family and hospice.
