HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient who is known to Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7422**] [**Doctor Last Name 61313**] of the adult
congenital group at [**Hospital3 1810**] was seen for follow
up in [**2141-12-25**].  She has had increasing shortness of
breath and angina.  She had a prior history of heart surgery
in [**2097**] for tetralogy of Fallot.  Her work up started again
in [**2141-12-25**] with an echocardiogram which showed
pulmonic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy.  She had
cardiac catheterization in [**2142-8-26**] which showed no
coronary disease per patient.  Prior surgeries include a
congenital heart repair in [**2097**], appendectomy in [**2103**], back
surgery in [**2109**], cholecystectomy in [**2115**], hysterectomy in
[**2127**] and ovarian cancer with oophorectomy, status post
chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  She also has a history
of shortness of breath, palpitations, obesity,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, pulmonic stenosis and a deep
venous thrombosis in her right arm.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Os-Cal daily, multivitamin
daily, Tylenol, ibuprofen and Prilosec PRN for headaches and
pain.  She is allergic to penicillin which causes a rash,
morphine which causes vomiting and Coumadin which causes a
rash.

She was seen originally on [**2142-12-17**] in the office
with examination as follows.  Five foot 3, 250 pounds.  Heart
rate was 71 in sinus rhythm, saturations 96 percent on room
air.  Blood pressure 108/84 in the right, 154/67 on the left.
She was sitting up in the chair with no apparent distress.
She had no rashes on her skin.  Her pupils were equally round
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Her neck was supple
with no carotid bruits.  Her lungs were clear bilaterally.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with S1, S2 tones and a
grade II/VI holosystolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is soft,
obese, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Her extremities were warm and well perfused without edema.
No varicosities were noted.  She was alert and oriented times
three, appropriate and grossly neurologically intact.
Femoral pulses were not palpated but she had 1 plus bilateral
dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial and radial pulses.  She had
no carotid bruits present.  Preoperative electrocardiogram
showed first degree AV block with a right bundle branch
block.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.2, hematocrit
44.1, PT 12.6, PTT 24.2, INR 1.0.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.1,
chloride 101, bicarb 31, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8, with a blood
sugar of 71.  ALT 42, AST 29, alkaline phosphatase 99,
amylase 54, total bilirubin 0.6.  The preoperative chest x-
ray did not identify any acute cardiopulmonary process.

She was also evaluated preoperatively on [**12-19**] by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of neurology for evaluation of spells of visual
loss and facial numbness.  She stated that she had for
approximately one year been having these stereotypical
episodes of numbness of her face and visual loss.  She also
has a known history of migraines.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] evaluated her on
[**12-19**] and recommended MRI of the brain with MRA
angiography to rule out any intracranial stenosis and also
rule out ischemic stroke.  She also discussed with the
patient better management of her migraine headaches and
headache prevention in regards to her sleep and was started
on Topamax 25 mg P.O. at bedtime, increasing it 50 mg P.O. at
bedtime thereafter for headache prophylaxis with the plan to
follow up in two months with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after she undergoes
cardiac surgery.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2142-12-26**] to undergo her procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7422**] [**Doctor Last Name 61313**] and on [**2142-12-26**] she underwent right
ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with a pericardial
patch and a pulmonic valve replacement with a mitral
bioprosthesis 27 mm in the pulmonic position.  Patient was
transferred to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.  On postoperative day one the patient was
on epinephrine drip at 0.05 mcg per kilograms per minute and
insulin drip at 15 units per hour and nitroglycerin drip
which was weaned to off.  She started Lasix diuresis and
remained intubated on CPAP pending blood gases for weaning to
extubated.  Postoperative laboratories as follows:  White
count 9.7, hematocrit 27, sodium 144, potassium 4.5, chloride
108, bicarb 28, BUN 16, creatinine 1.0, blood sugar of 95.
PT 13, PTT 30, INR 1.2.  The patient remained intubated.
Right course remained in the groin.  Later that day the
patient was extubated and was doing well.  Patient remained
on pressors at its low rate.  Patient was also seen
postoperatively that evening and the following morning by the
[**Location (un) 86**] Area Cardiology Group, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 56666**], and also initial
evaluation by rehabilitation services.  Recommendations were
recognized and appreciated by the cardiology service.
Patient was placed on deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and
was aggressively diuresed.  Several hours after extubation
patient had to be reintubated and appeared to have partial
airway obstruction.  Her saturations dropped to 94 percent
and given the amount of edema and difficulty it was elected
to fiberoptically intubate the patient again by anesthesia.
This was difficult secondary to edema and partial obstruction
but endotracheal tube was placed successfully and patient
tolerated the procedure without any complications.  She
remained under sedation at that time.  She remained on
postoperative day two also on an epinephrine drip of 0.05 and
an insulin drip of 11 units.  Patient also continued with
Lasix diuresis and aspirin and perioperative Vancomycin.  She
remained sedated with a Swan-Ganz and an arterial line in
place, was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure 152/71,
in sinus rhythm at 87.  Her creatinine dropped slightly to
26.8.  Patient was also given steroids to help with the
edema.  She was also screened by the clinical nutrition team.
The patient was also placed on Natrecor and was off
epinephrine on [**12-29**] and had significant diuresis.
Patient continued to be evaluated for extubation and on
postoperative day three remained on propofol and epinephrine
at low dose.  White count rose slightly to 18.1 and the
creatinine remained stable at 1.1.

The remained comfortable on the propofol.  Patient had
supraventricular tachycardia on postoperative day four.
Epinephrine was stopped.  She remained on Natrecor drip at
0.02 and Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.018 and continued with 4 mg
dexamethasone q.i.d. for airway edema.  Patient also received
a dose of Diamox and on postoperative day five the patient
continued with diuresis.  Neo-Synephrine was restarted.
Natrecor was held.  The patient received two doses of Diamox
again.  The white count dropped slightly to 17.6.  Patient
continued overall to do well, had good pain control and was
hemodynamically stable with blood pressure 106/49 and sinus
rhythm at 68.  On postoperative day six the patient was
transferred from the cardiothoracic recovery unit out to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
2, was encouraged to start her activity with the nurses and
physical therapist.  Electrolytes were repleted.  Lasix was
changed to 20 B.I.D.  A follow up chest x-ray was ordered.
Heart sounds were distant.  She had decreased breath sounds
at the bases.  Her neurologic examination was nonfocal.  The
sternum was stable.  The incision was clean, dry and intact.
Extremities were warm with trace edema.  Central venous line
was out.  Pacing wires were removed.  Chest tubes were
removed.  Physical therapy evaluation was done on the floor.
Patient continued to be seen every day by the Adult
Congenital Service from [**Hospital1 **].  On postoperative
