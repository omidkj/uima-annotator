Service:  CARDIOTHOR

NOTE:  THE PATIENT IS A SIGNIFICANT FALL RISK.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female, who had a history of aortic stenosis and developed
syncope.  The patient underwent a scheduled cardiac
catheterization and was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2165-9-30**].  The patient states that she had
been experiencing increasing chest pain and shortness of
breath on exertion, especially over the month prior to
admission.  She subjectively feels that she had been getting
worse.  Echocardiogram was performed on [**10/2164**], which had
shown a preserved EF of 65% with severe aortic stenosis with
peak gradient of 45 mmHg and estimated aortic valve area of
0.8 cm squared.  Repeat echocardiogram done on [**2165-5-1**],
showed severe AS with a peak gradient of 52 mmHg with cross
sectional area of 0.6 cm squared, showing 2+ MR and 2+ TR.
Besides the symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain,
the patient had episode of syncope, lightheadedness, and loss
of consciousness that had occurred during the months prior to
admission.  Given the significant morbidity and mortality
noted to occur with patient's with AS and the above
complications of AS, she was scheduled for cardiac
catheterization to see if she was a possible valve-repair
candidate, as well as to find out if she had any clinically
significant cardiac disease.  Cardiac catheterization on
[**2165-9-30**] showed left main coronary artery showing diffuse
plaque with approximately 30% lesion.  The LAD had an ostial
stenosis of 40%.  The left circumflex was patent.  The right
coronary artery was moderately calcified with a mid 70%
stenosis and it was a right dominant system.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Breast cancer, status post radical left mastectomy and
left upper extremity lymphedema.
2.  History of transient ischemic attacks.
3.  Status post hysterectomy in the past.
4.  Status post appendectomy in the past.
5.  Aortic stenosis as mentioned above.
6.  History of osteoarthritis in the bilateral hips, status
post left hip pinning in the past.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS UPON ARRIVAL:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
2.  Ultram as needed for pain.
3.  Lotensin 10 mg PO q.d for hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History is significant for the patient being
married to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **].  Home #:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 45383**].  She has a
huge fall risk.  She uses a three-wheel chair and walker at
baseline and has a history of falls with hitting her head
secondary to unsteady gait, as well as syncope.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following:
Hematocrit 34.3, potassium 3.7, BUN and creatinine of 12 and
0.7.  INR of 1.0.  On telemetry, she had evidence of first
degree AV block, thought to be the result of the cardiac
catheterization on [**2165-9-30**], as noted diffuse plaque with
30% lesion in the left main coronary artery.  LAD had an
ostial stenosis of 40%.  The left circumflex artery was
patent.  The right coronary artery was moderately calcified
with mid 70% stenosis.  She had a high pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of approximately 29.  She had severe aortic
stenosis and moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis.  She has
severe systolic-systolic arterial hypertension.  Severe left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction.  No obstructive
hypertrophy noted.

The patient had been transferred from an outside hospital for
the issue of syncope.  The patient had the above cardiac
catheterization performed here at the outside hospital.  She
had head CT performed secondary to head trauma sustained from
syncope, might be secondary to aortic stenosis.  The head CT
showed no evidence of acute bleeding or infarction.  It did
show diffuse atrophy and changes consistent with a
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old brain.

Chest x-ray on [**2165-9-28**] at the outside hospital showed
cardiomegaly, wide superior mediastinum, possible tortuous
innominate vessels and no evidence of CHF or focal
infiltrate, no effusion.  Due to the nature of her fall and
the hip pain she complained of at the outside hospital, she
did have an x-ray on [**2165-9-28**].  There was markedly
demineralized bone, extensive degenerative arthritis, SI
joint was preserved, nailing of the old left hip fracture was
intact.  Right hip showed possible fracture at the level of
the greater trochanter with follow up films negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Admission was notable for vital signs
with a temperature of 96.6, blood pressure 184/80, pulse 78
and regular, respiratory rate 16 with saturation of 96% on
room air.  GENERAL:  The patient was awake and alert, more
actively interactive, intact mental status.  HEENT:
Examination was notable for pain and clear oropharynx.
Mucous membranes moist.  Tongue midline.  Extraocular muscles
are intact.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was regular rate and rhythm.
She had a 3/6 systolic crescendo murmur throughout the
precordium.  She had no carotid bruits.  Chest examination
revealed good inspiratory effort, bilaterally, clear to
auscultation, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi.  ABDOMEN:  Good
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no guarding, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  No ascites.  EXTREMITIES:  Warm.
Peripheral pulses palpable in the dorsalis pedis bilaterally.
No edema.  No cyanosis.  No calf tenderness.  No tissue loss
or ulceration.  SKIN:  Right groin site, status post cardiac
catheterization; noted for no hematoma, no bruit, no oozing.

Due to the assessment and the critical AS and significant two
vessel coronary disease, consultation with the cardiac
surgical service was obtained with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**].  The patient was
deemed a relatively high risk, but appropriate candidate for
valve replacement given her significant aortic stenosis.
Therefore, on [**2165-10-3**], the patient went to the operating
room.  The patient underwent an AVR with 19 mm pericardial
valve, as well as a two-vessel coronary artery bypass graft
utilizing saphenous vein graft to the LAD, as well as
saphenous vein graft to the RPDA.  This was done by
Dr.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] as the attending surgeon, as well as having
Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in attendance and assistance, as well
as [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as a nurse practitioner as first assistant.
The pericardium was left open.  She left the operating room
with right radial A line, right IG Swan-Ganz catheter.  She
had two ventricular pacing wires, two atrial pacing wires,
two mediastinal chest tubes.  Coronary pulmonary bypass was
132 minutes with cross-clamp time of 108 minutes.  She left
the operating room with mean arterial pressure of 115, CVP 9,
PID pressure of 13, and a pulmonary artery mean pressure of
18.  She was being A-V paced with underlying junctional
rhythm noted.  Rate was 888 with the A-V pacing.  She was on
epinephrine at 0.02 mcg per kilogram per minute.  The patient
was on propofol for sedation at 20 mcg per kilogram per
minute.  She was transferred to the CSRU for postoperative
care.

By postoperative day #1, she remained intubated.  She
remained sleepy secondary to her sedation.  She was on
insulin drip for blood glucose control.  Nipride at 0.8 and
nitroglycerin 0.25 for adequate blood pressure management.
It was noted that the A-wires were inconsistently pacing.
The patient was placed on an A-demand setting.  She seemed to
have an asystolic underlying rhythm at this time, therefore,
she was being paced accordingly.  She was weaned off her
epinephrine overnight.  Otherwise, she was hemodynamically
okay.  She was afebrile at 98 with an accelerated junctional
rhythm postoperatively.  She was on CPAP and pressure
supports with adequate tidal volumes, minimal support
overall.  Gases showed good ventilation and oxygenation.  She
was ultimately weaned to extubate.  She was transfused a unit
of blood for postoperative hematocrit of 24.8.  The BUN and
