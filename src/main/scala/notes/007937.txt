At [**Hospital1 18**] ED:  FSBS 132/85, SBP 101.

Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo RH man with history of afib on coumadin
who presents with episode of right sided arm weakness and left
eye amaurosis starting around 9:00 am today.

His wife found him in the closet saying "I cant make it". He
also
complained of difficulty
seeing with his left eye. His speech was normal. His wife did
not
notice a facial droop or a limp limb at the time.  She called
911
and he was brought to an OSH.  Once there, his wife explains
that
he had trouble lifting up the right arm and in writing his name.

Unfortunately, she was not certain about the duration of this
symptoms.

Once in the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] his MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 66268**]. We checked his
FSG
and it was 60. He received D50 and with a FSG of 180 he remained
confused. There was no eye deviation, no tonic-clonic shaking or
posturing. He
was not following commands, though. He received ativan 1 mg and
his MS did not improve. He has been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] during
three different examinations with me and then Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **].

He received ativan 1 mg iv in the ED without response while
undergoing a period of AMS. His VS did not change.
Eventually, the ED team decided to ETT him to protect his
airway.

Imaging:

CT [**2193-5-15**]:
HEAD CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift
of midline
structures, or edema. Left frontal cortical and subcortical
hypodensity is
consistent with a chronic infarct. Left occipital hypodensity is
of
indeterminate age (2T:11). The ventricles and cerebral sulci are
prominent,
compatible with age-related volume loss. Periventricular areas
of
hypoattenuation likely reflect chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.

The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
normally
pneumatized and aerated. There are no concerning osseous
lesions.

CTA NECK AND HEAD: Anatomy of the aortic arch is standard. The
origins of
the vertebral arteries and common carotid arteries are patent.
The right and
left common carotid arteries are patent, with calcifications at
the
bifurcations. The right common carotid artery is patent
throughout its
course, with calcifications predominantly at the bifurcation.
The right
common carotid artery measures 5mm at the skull base and 4.5mm
at the at the
bifurcation.

The left common carotid artery is occluded, with tapering
stenosis
approximately 1 cm distal to the bifurcation, extending to the
level of its
terminus, where it is reconstituted through the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**]. The axial
source images suggest an intimal flap raising the possibility of
underlying
spontaneous dissection. The left external carotid artery
contains thrombus
and is virtually occluded approximately 3.5cm from the common
carotid
bifurcation (4:187).

There are calcifications at the origins of the right and left
vertebral
arteries, which are normal in caliber throughout their course,
without
flow-limiting stenosis. The right vertebral artery is dominant,
but both
vertebral arteries contribute to the basilar artery.

The circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is patent, including patent middle,
anterior and
posterior cerebral arteries, bilaterally. No aneurysm larger
than 2 mm is
detected. Calcifications of the cavernous segments of the
internal carotid
arteries, right greater than left are mild.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally
pneumatized and
aerated. There are no concerning osseous lesions.

Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is incompletely imaged.
The largest
included lymph node, in the precarinal station, measures 2.3 cm
x 1.3 cm. The
lung apices are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. Chronic left frontal
infarct. Left
occipital infarct, age indeterminate. N.B. CT perfusion images
could not be
processed due to patient motion.
2. Tapered occlusion of the left internal carotid artery from 1
cm distal to
the bifurcation to the level of its terminus; this may be acute,
and the
mo
