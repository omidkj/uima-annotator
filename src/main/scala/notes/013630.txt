CXR:  IMPRESSION: Persistent retrocardiac opacity, which could
represent atelectasis, although pneumonia is not excluded.
Cardiomegaly with prominance of the pulmonary vascularity, but
no overt congestive heart failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
107 russian only speaking F w/ dCHF, HTN p/w acute onset SOB.
.
#SOB: Patient minimally desatted and was placed on CPAP
overnight initially.  She was initially given antibiotics, but
the lack of fever, white count and [**Male First Name (un) **] CXR fiondings made
pneumonia unlikely and the antibiotics were continued.  The next
day she was weaned to room air.  She remained satting well on
room air.  She did desat overnight once and responded to 2L NC.
In the morning again she was weaned to room air.  Current
thinking is small aspiration event or mucous plugging.  She was
placed on aspiration precautions.
.
# Persistent retrocardiac opacity: Unlikely to represent
pneumonia as unchanged over time.  More likely atelectasis.
Small pleural effusion.
.
#h/o Meningioma: cont home dialntin
.
# anemia: per previous notes, egd and colon deffered.  She was
given one unit of blood slowly and her hematocrit responded
appropriatly.
.
# dCHF: She was continued on her home dose of lasix.  She was
given one extra dose of lasix 20mg with her transfusion.  As the
patient did not appear clinically volume overloaded and her labs
were trending towards being dry (Cr. up from 0.8 on previous
admission to 1.2).  The decision was made to hold her lasix.
Would check her labs in [**1-20**] days to see if Creatinine trending
down.  If not she may benefit from some IV fluids.  If she
starts to appear volume overloaded would restart her lasix at
20mg daily and uptitrate as needed.
