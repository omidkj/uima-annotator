Admission Date:  [**2138-6-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2138-7-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2085-1-5**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Thoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 9935**] is a 53-year-old
woman with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post
radiation therapy distantly.  She has suffered from
fibrothorax secondary to radiation therapy and had a
restrictive airway disease.  She has had a prior
pericardectomy for restriction pericarditis.  Her radiation
therapy was in [**2110**] and restrictive disease left her on home
oxygen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post radiation therapy in [**2110**]
complicated by fibrothorax and restrictive pericarditis.
2.  Status post splenectomy for a staging laparotomy.
3.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.
4.  Restrictive lung disease requiring home oxygen.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a very strong family support
system who have been quite helpful with her recovery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Iron 325 mg p.o. q.d.
 3.  Epogen 40,000 units subcutaneous every Thursday (to be
discontinued after two more weeks).
 4.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 5.  Sertraline HCL 50 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Levothyroxine 100 mcg p.o. q.d.
 7.  Enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.
 8.  Nystatin oral suspension 5 mL p.o. q.i.d.
 9.  Lansoprazole oral solution 30 mg p.o. q.d.
10.  Albuterol nebulizers 5 puffs to 10 puffs q.4h. and
p.r.n.
11.  Clindamycin 300 mg p.o. q.6h. (to be discontinued on
[**7-18**]).
12.  Calcium gluconate p.r.n.
13.  Artifical Tears p.r.n.
14.  Percocet elixir 5 mL to 10 mL q.4-6h. p.r.n. via the
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to INTRAVENOUS DYE.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   The patient's lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  There were no
effusions.  Her heart rate was regular with a normal first
heart sound and second heart sound.  There were no murmurs.
Her abdomen was soft, benign, nontender, and nondistended.
The tenderness and erythema near her percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube site was nearly resolved.  She had a small
drain at this site which was to be discontinued at a later
date.  The patient had mild peripheral edema which had
improved on Lasix over the course of her postoperative
recovery.  She had no neurologic status, and her mental
status was excellent.  She communicated via a marker board,
but was being trained in how to use the fenestrate
tracheostomy tube.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory values
revealed a white blood cell count of 12,000, hematocrit
of 27, platelets of 384.  Sodium of 135, potassium of 3.5
(her potassium may need to be followed on Lasix), chloride
of 95, bicarbonate of 32, blood urea nitrogen of 20,
creatinine of 0.4, blood glucose of 119.  Magnesium of 2,
phosphate of 3.2, calcium of 8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A repeat chest x-rays with the Heimlich
valve in place have demonstrated her lung to be fully
expanded.  Termination of the chest tube will be dependent on
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2138-6-11**], the patient had a left
decortication in the operating room.  The patient had a
failure to wean postoperatively, and her postoperative course
was complicated by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus and Enterobacter pneumonia.  A tracheostomy was
performed on [**6-20**].

On [**7-1**], she began to tolerate tracheostomy collar for
prolonged periods of time.  On [**6-30**], off the ventilator,
her air leak stopped.  She began to take more oral intake at
this time.  She was receiving tube feeds via a postpyloric
feeding tube.  On [**7-1**], her antibiotics were stopped.  She
received a full course of vancomycin and ceftazidime.

On [**7-4**], a Heimlich valve was attached to her chest tube.
She received a bronchoscopy and a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube was placed.  Her central line was removed at
this time as well.

On [**7-6**], she developed an elevated white blood cell count
and fevers.  She was noted to have a cellulitis around her
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site.  A small drain
was placed beside the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube site, and some pus was removed.  The site is now
adequately drained, and the cellulitis nearly resolved.  She
was to receive a 2-week course of p.o. clindamycin (begun on
[**7-6**]).

She was on a regular diet, but her calorie counts have been
somewhat low, so she was receiving tube feeds.  She is
presently receiving 45 cc per hour of full-strength Respalor
tube feeds through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube.  As her oral intake improves, we anticipate that her
tube feedings will be able to be cut down and eventually
stopped.

A fenestrated tracheostomy tube was placed on [**7-8**].  At the
time of discharge, her fevers had subsided and white blood
cell count returned to [**Location 213**].  She was receiving vigorous
physical therapy and was able to walk across the length of
the Intensive Care Unit unassisted.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post left decortication.
2.  Status post tracheostomy.
3.  Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

DISCHARGE ACTIVITY:  The patient's activity is as tolerated,
and she should tolerate aggressive physical therapy.

DISCHARGE DIET:  She was tolerating a regular diet but needs
to improve her oral intake.    Her tube feedings should be
weaned as her oral intake improves.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   She should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**]
one week following discharge.
