History of Present Illness:
History limited as patient intubated and family not present at
time of exam. This is a 75 yo F with metastatic (brain/bone)
transitional cell CA of bladder, here from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
tachypnea (RR 40-42), hypoxia (70s%), tachycardia (119-128),
hypotension (62/40), temp 98. CXR at rehab felt to be consistent
with bilateral PNA. She was given IV levofloxacin and referred
to the ED.
.

She is on her 4th L of IVF. She was given vanc/zosyn here. EKG
showed sinus tach at 130 bpm, T wave flattening diffusely. She
was intubated with etomidate and succinylcholine, given
phenylephrine bolus prior to intubation. She had a L femoral
line placed in nonsterile conditions, later pulled with a clean
R IJ placed. Currently on norepinephrine, had 5L IVF. Going to
give RBCs for hct 19. Has guaiac pos dark brown stool. CXR not
overly impressive, getting CT torso prior to transfer. Current
VS: 110-120s 110/70 100%. In the ICU, she is intubated and
sedated.

III. Radiology

A. CXR
1. Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position as above.
2. At least two patchy foci, one in the right infrahilar region
and one in
the retrocardiac left lower lobe, which may represent foci of
aspiration or
early-developing multifocal pneumonia.
3. Subtle pulmonary vascular indistinctness may indicate early
pulmonary
edema
4. Compression fracture of a lower thoracic vertebral body of
indeterminate
acuity.
5. Small pleural effusions.

B. CT Torso with Contrast:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Multifocal opacities within both lungs are new and while they
may
represent multifocal pneumonia in light of the other findings,
metastatic
disease is also a consideration.
3. New bilateral small pleural effusions.
4. New liver metastases involving both lobes.
5. New retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
6. Worsening bone metastases.
7. Retroperitoneal soft tissue mass decreased in size.
.
CT Head:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial findings. Grossly unchanged
right
cavernous sinus mass, extending along the tentorium. MRI would
be more
sensitive for posterior fossa abnormalities and reassessment of
metastatic
disease, particularly if brainstem and cranial nerve involvement
is suspected.
2. Complete right mastoid opacification and middle ear
opacification. Given concern for perineural tumor spread from
the right cavernous sinus, this finding may relate to
obstruction of drainage by the skull base mass. Please correlate
clinically to assess for acute infection.
3. Partial left mastoid air cell opacification.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19704**] is a 75-year-old female with
metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who
presented with hypoxic respiratory failure that was likely
multifactorial in setting of tumor burden and possible
multifocal pneumonia although aspiration is a consideration, and
hemodynamic instability requiring aggressive volume
resuscitation, pressor support with norepinephrine, and
intubation. The patient had last been treated for cancer, but
her regimen has been on hold since [**Month (only) **] secondary to a hip
fracture with subsequent poor performance status and medical
issues related to her rehabiliation and chronic medical
conditions.  Imaging revealed further metastasis with suggested
brain involvement, new retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy,
worsening bone metastases, new liver metastases, and possible
multifocal lung metastatis although pneumonia was a
consideration.  Patient was extubated on [**2199-1-1**] per family
desire to pursue comfort care given progressively worsening
clinical status and died on [**2199-1-1**] at 12:35 PM.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure:
Her respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to either
multifocal pneumonia or worsening metastasis from underlying
malignancy. PE was excluded in setting of recent hip fracture
s/p repair. She was intubated and required support throughout
her hospitalization. She was treated broadly with vancomycin (IV
and PO), cefepime, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole for both
anaerobic and pulmonary infections in addition to C. diff given
leukocytosis. Microbiology did not suggest infectious etiology.
Patient was extubated on [**2199-1-1**] per family desire to pursue
comfort care given progressively worsening status and died on
[**2199-1-1**] at 12:35 PM.

.
# Septic shock:
Patient was hypotensive on presentation and required high-volume
resuscitation, pressor support with levophed. Etiology was
thought to be septic process although high tumor burden could
have caused destabilization and no overt
