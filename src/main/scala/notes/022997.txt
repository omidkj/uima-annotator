Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chronic aortic dissection and aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2176-5-6**] - Repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm with a
Vascutech Gelweave 28 mm Dacron tube graft using partial right
heart bypass.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman who a long time ago had a
type B aortic dissection. The patient was followed by multiple
physicians but eventually made his way to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
vascular surgery. It was  Dr.[**Name (NI) 1720**] impression that the
aneurysm had grown significantly in size and had reached a size
at which the risk of rupture outweighed the risk of surgery.
Therefore, the patient was referred to me for consideration of
open repair versus stent grafting and it was my belief that open
repair would be much better for this young gentleman. He now
presents for surgical management.

Physical Exam:
106/60  76 SR  12
GEN: WDWN african american male in NAD
SKIN: Unremarkable
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, OP benign. Poor dentition
NECK: Supple with FROM
LUNGS: Clear
HEART: RRR, Nl S1-S2\
ABD: BEnign
EXT: Warm, well perfused. Pulses 1+-2+ throughout
NEURO: Without focal deficits

Pertinent Results:
[**2176-5-6**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild to moderate
left ventricular concentric hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There is a
descending thoracic aortic dissection. A connection between true
and false lumens is seen just distal to the takeoff off the left
subclavian artery. The dissection flap extends both proximally
and distallly. The proximal extent can not be completely
visualized but likely extends to the distal arch. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild tricuspid rtegurgitation. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 914**] were notified in person of the results in the operating
room at the time of the study.

POST-BYPASS: Normal biventricular systolic function. The
descending thoracic graft is very poorly seen and can not be
commented on. Mild mitral regurgitation remains. The ascending
aorta appears intact. No other changes from pre bypass study.

[**2176-5-7**] Head CT
1) No evidence of acute intracranial process.
2) Encephalomalacic changes in the left frontal lobe likely due
to old infarct. Old bilateral basal ganglia lacunar infarcts.
3) Sclerotic changes of the right mastoid air cell likely due to
old inflammation.
4) Mucosal thickening involving ethmoid air cells and sphenoid
sinuses may be due to chronic inflammatory changes or to NG
tube.
5) NG Dobhoff feeding tube appears to be coiled within the
nasopharynx on the single lateral scout image.

[**2176-5-9**] Head CT
1. No acute intracranial pathology including no hemorrhage.

2. Stable encephalomalacic changes of the left frontal lobe most
likely related to the old infarct. Unchanged bilateral basal
ganglia and left thalamic infarcts.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2176-5-6**] for surgical
management of his chronic type B dissection. He was taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent repair of
descending thoracic aortic aneurysm with a Vascutech Gelweave 28
mm Dacron tube graft using partial right heart bypass. Please
see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to
the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] and was extubated. He was
noted to have severe dysarthria and aphasia and mild left sided
weakness. The stroke service was consulted. An initial CT scan
showed no new changes however a repeat CT scan showed that the
left frontal area showed a subacute evolving infarction. Aspirin
was increased to 325mg daily. Tube feeds were started via a
dobhoff tube and a speech and swallow consult was obtained.
Moderate dysphagia was noted on swallowing exam and tube feeds
were recommended to be continued. Oral intake was allowed but
with supervision. On postoperative day three, he was transferred
to the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. Physical and
occupational therapy were consulted for assistance with his
postoperative recovery. Mr. [**Known lastname 17113**] ability to swallow improved.
He self removed the dobhoff tube and it was decided he could
continue with oral intake with supervision.  Calorie counts were
recommended to be sure of adequate nutrition. He is to start
taking aggrenox when he no longer requires pills to be crushed.
He may discontinue aspirin when aggrenox can be restarted.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
to rehabilitation on POD # 8.  Plan for follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**]
in clinic [**5-14**].
