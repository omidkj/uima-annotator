Rigid bronchoscopy with debridement of granulation tissue and
trach size change

History of Present Illness:

s/p recent tracheal bleed and trach change [**2106-7-4**] transferred
from OSH with recurrent tracheal bleed for IP eval and
bronchoscopy. Oxygen saturations 80% on 50% FiO2 in IP suite so
she was admitted to MICU for bronchoscopy and evaluation.

new cuffless #6 trach tube. There was ? HSV but biopsies were
negative.

[**8-26**], [**8-27**] Blood Cx pending, NGTD

[**8-26**] CXR:  Low lung volumes. Minimal bilateral atelectasis

[**8-27**] CT Trachea:
1. Extensive abnormal soft tissue thickening in the supraglottic
and
infraglottic regions and surrounding the tracheostomy, likely
reflecting
granulation tissue. Severe stenosis at the level of the cricoid
cartilage. The tracheostomy appears patent.
2. Limited evaluation of the lungs due to respiratory motion. No
large
pulmonary nodules or areas of consolidation.

[**8-30**] CXR: Worsening left mid lung zone opacity concerning for
infection or
worsening atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Acute Hypoxemic on Chronic Respiratory Failure - This was
thought to be due to  granulation tissue seen around the area of
her tracheostomy and subglottic stenosis.  She had a rigid
bronchoscopy by IP which showed diffuse granulation tissue
around her stoma and her trach, as well as subglottic stenosis.
This was debrided and a larger size (#7 non-fenestrated) trach
tube was inserted.  She tolerated the procedure well without
difficulty.  The patient had hemoptysis at an OSH that was
initially thought to be HSV tracheitis, however biopsies were
negative.  The hemoptysis was thought to be due to the
granulation tissue.  Per IP recs, started omeprazole and
ranitidine.  Hct remained stable during admission.  WBC trended
down to 10.3.  PSV overnight, required peak 10 PEEP 5 overnight
night of [**8-29**].  Trach mask trial successful during day.

UTI: Patient with cloudy, foul smelling urine.  U/A showed
evidence of UTI with many bacteria.  Started on Cipro.  On day 3
of antibiotics, culture results became available, showing
Klebsiella sensitive only to Zosyn, gentamycin, and meropenem.
Patient had a PICC line placed by IR as the PICC team could not
at bedside.  She was discharged on meropenem as she had a
previous reaction to zosyn.

Diabetes: On detemir and humalog sliding scale.  Hypoglycemic to
60s during afternoon and overnight, so decreased detemir from 25
[**Hospital1 **] to 20 [**Hospital1 **].

Anxiety:  Ativan prn.

Yeast infection:  Noted white discharge and foul odor.  Received
Fluconazole 200mg x1.

Asthma: Continued home albuterol.

Thrush: Nystatin oral suspension.

LUE pain: Pt reports LUE pain with unclear chronicity on
neurontin. [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to CVA vs DVT, chronic neuropathic
pain. Continued neurontin and used oxycodone prn.

CAD and s/p CVA: Held ASA for procedure.  Prior to discharge,
ASA was restarted with agreement from Interventional
Pulmonology.
