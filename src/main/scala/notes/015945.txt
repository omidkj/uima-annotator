Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status; left frontal subdural hematoma


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26598**] is an 86 year old woman with DM2, coronary artery
disease with prior PCI, and CKD V on hemodialysis who was
transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday for subdural hematoma.
Patient was originally admitted to [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital on
[**2165-1-16**] with chest pain and a suggestion of subtle ECG changes.
Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.04-0.05. She had reportedly
been having intermittent chest pain for several days prior to
admission as well as some mild disorientation. While at OSH, she
was put on IV heparin and nitroglycerin with resolution of her
chest discomfort. She also had transient dyspnea which was
relieved with albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers and BiPAP. She
was taken for cardiac catheterization yesterday morning at OSH
which reportedly showed stability of her known coronary artery
disease; specifically, there was a 90% stenosis at the ostium of
D1, 10-20% in-stent restenosis in the LAD, and a proximal 40%
RCA stenosis which had negative pressure wire testing.
.
Following the catheterization at OSH, she reportedly had some
change in her mental status. A head CT showed a 7 mm left-sided
subdural hematoma along the cerebral convexity with 5 mm of
midline shift at the septum pellucidum. Because of these events,
she did not undergo scheduled hemodialysis yesterday, and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for neurosurgery eval.
.
Records report an intention to give protamine sulfate, though
it??????s unclear if it was given prior to transfer. Upon arrival to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was noted to be ??????A&Ox3??????. A head CT showed a 6
mm ??????subacute?????? left subdural hematoma along the cerebral
convexity. Neurosurgery saw her and recommended serial
examination, loading with phenytoin 1000 mg IV, and a followup
CT in the morning. She received IV morphine for complaints of a
headache and became transiently hypotensive (SBPs in the 80s)
with some worsening delirium; another head CT was unchanged
compared to the one on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. She received insulin,
dextrose, and kayexelate for mild hyperkalemia. She received one
bag of a platelet transfusion due to her recent antiplatelet
therapy. She was admitted to MICU yesterday.
.
While she was in MICU, patient was comfortable, denied any
discomfort. She was mildly somnolent but awakened easily and
responded appropriately to questioning, though she was somewhat
tangential and distractible.  Patient underwent hemodialysis
today.  Her repeat head CT showed no significant change in SDH,
and her neuro exam had no focal deficits, so she was transferred
to medicine floor for continued monitoring.
.
Upon arrival to the medicine floor, patient was alert and
orientated x3.  She said she has been having chronic
intermittent headaches (she attributes it to her known
meningioma), but currently she has no headache.  She has no
other complaints.  She denies feeling confused. No fever,
chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal
pain.  No shortness of breath or chest pain.  No dysuria.  No
vision changes.
.
Of note, patient states that she fell 3 weeks ago.  She said she
tripped on something while walking on the carpet, and fell.  She
denied LOC, and her husband was the witness.  She didn't check
her glucose level at the time.  She had no sz, no loss of bowel
and urinary control, no post-ictal confusion.

Head CT ([**2165-1-18**]- 16:15):
Subdural blood layers over the left cerebral convexity,
measuring approximately 6 mm in depth. This blood is isodense to
minimally hyperdense with respect to the brain parenchyma,
suggesting subacute age. There is only minimal bowing of the
septum pellucidum to the contralateral side. Ventricles and
sulci are slightly enlarged consistent with parenchymal volume
loss. Periventricular white matter hypodensity reflects chronic
microvascular infarction. Small calcifications are present in
the basal ganglia bilaterally. Hyperdense material seen within
the intracranial vasculature suggests previous contrast-enhanced
imaging study, presumably done at an outside institution. There
is a hyperdense extra-axial lesion seen within the left
cerebello-pontine angle, measuring 11 x 16 mm, most consistent
with a meningioma (provided history indicates that there was a
previous diagnosis of intracranial meningioma). There is no
fracture. The mastoid air cells are cl
