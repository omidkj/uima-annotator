Pertinent Results:
EKG: [**5-6**] NSR 70 bpm, nl axis, nl int, no ST-T changes
.
CXR [**5-7**]: Comparison is made to a CT of the chest acquired one
hour after the chest radiograph. The endotracheal tube is
located with the tip approximately 4.4 cm above the carina.
There are bilateral hazy opacities predominantly in the mid and
lower lung zones, which are consistent with atelectasis/pleural
effusions on the CT scan. The heart size is at the upper border
of normal. An NG tube is seen with the tip projecting over the
gastroesophageal junction. This should be advanced further.
There is a mild amount of interstitial edema. There is also
prominence of the hilar vessels. IMPRESSION: Moderate CHF with
bilateral pleural effusion/atelectasis. NG tube with tip at the
gastroesophageal junction. No evidence for pneumonia.
.
CTA Chest [**5-7**]: 1. No evidence of PE.  2. Multiple ulcerated
atherosclerotic plaques in the descending aorta.  3. Bilateral
atelectasis and small pleural effusions.  4. Multiple
mediastinal lymph nodes, some of which meet size criteria for
pathologic enlargement.
.
TTE [**5-8**]: The LA is mildly dilated. The LV cavity size is normal.
 Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. RV chamber size is normal.
Biventricular systolic function appears grossly preserved but
views are technically suboptimal. The aortic valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The
aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen in
suboptimal views. There may be a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
CXR [**2126-5-18**] - The heart is normal in size and the lungs are
clear. There is no evidence of failure. Position of the right
subclavian catheter, ETT, and NGT are unchanged since [**2126-5-16**].
There is no pneumothorax. There are no focal infiltrates. The
heart is normal in size.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo F with no known history, intubated on the field for
respiratory distress found to be in acute pulmonary edema,
failure to wean most likely [**3-7**] to underlying COPD and EtOH
withdrawal. Reintubated [**5-10**].
.
# Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema given
increased pulmonary vasculature and bilateral pleural effusions
on CXR, CT with bilateral diffuse ground glass
opacities/effusions. Elevated BNP on labs. Patient also with
severe smoking history and radiologic changes c/w COPD. Unknown
precipitant except for severe HTN requiring nitroglycerin gtt.
No evidence of acute ischemic event. Patient also subsequently
found to have LLL consolidation and underwent a 9 day course of
Zosyn for gram negative rods that were sparse on sputum culture.
  There was no evidence of PE on CTA.  Patient further work up
in CHF was done with a TTE [**5-8**], which showed grossly preserved
EF with suggestion of diastolic dysfunction but poor windows.
Patient was initially extubated on [**5-10**] however due to increasing
aggitation she required large amounts of valium and due to
increased somnolence she was reintubated for protection of her
airway.  She was successfully extubated on [**5-18**] and quickly
titrated down to 3L and transferred to the floor.  She was on
steroids in the ICU and they were discontinued on [**5-17**].  On the
floor she was slowly weaned off oxygen and maintained O2 sats
92-93% on room air.  On discharge will need continued management
of heartfailure with afterload reduction and rate control.
.
# EtOH use/agitation - [**Name (NI) **] husband reported 3 [**Name2 (NI) 17963**] per
day, however the amount remains uncertain.  Patient admits to
daily drinking herself and has been a drinker for last [**3-8**]
years. Patient peri-extubation required high doses of Valium up
to 100 mg a day and also standing Haldol for presumed ICU
delirium.  Her symptoms were much improved by day 7 of
hospitalization.  Standing haldol was weaned off and she was
placed on CIWA scale where she did not require much valium and
this was weaned off aswell.  Addiction consult spoke with the
patient on the floor as well.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC count upto 16K however no evidence of
infection after treatment of PNA.  This was likely due to actue
stress reaction or secondary to steroids.  WBC trended down to
11 off steroids.
.
# HTN: Found to be hypertensive on the field, started on nitro
gtt. Currently normotensive.  Patient became more hypertensive
throughout her stay and her captopril and metoprolol were
titrated up.  They were subsequently changed to atenolol and
lisinopril for improved compliance and doses were titrated.
.
# FEN: PO diet, Evaluated by S&S here who recommended a PO diet
with chin tuck.
# PPX: maintained on SC heparin and nicotine patch.
