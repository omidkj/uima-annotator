Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
catheterization, placement of balloon pump

History of Present Illness:
49 year old with PMH of hypertension and recently diagnosed DM2
presented with acute onset of chest, bilateral shoulder, and arm
pain. He also had severe diaphoresis. EMS was called and an EKG
in the field was obtained, showing anterior ST segment
elevation. He was hypotensive with SBP 80's. He was transfered
to [**Hospital1 **] ER and started on IV heparin drip, got aspirin 325
mg, and plavix. Brought emergently to cath lab where he was
found to have 3 vessel disease and LAD 60-70% ostial stenosis
with eccentric 95% stenosis, 90% proximal stenosis of the ramus,
and occluded RCA, filling distally via left to right collaterals
from the left circumflex.

A stent was placed in the LAD and dilated with balloons,
resulting in good flow. His cardiogenic shock with hypotension,
low cardiac output and elevated left heart filling pressures
required placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient
started frothing at the mouth with acute pulmonary edema,
requiring intubation. The procedure was complicated by an iliac
laceration.

Bedside echo performed showed septal, lateral, and anterior
hypokinesis with EF 15-20% and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

Transthoracic ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction
30%) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum,
anterior free wall, and apex. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Impression: no left ventricular apical thrombus

HEAD CT W/O IV CONTRAST: There is angulation of scan plane due
to the patient's position. There is no intra or extraaxial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of midline structures.
Differentiation of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter is preserved. The
ventricles, sulci, and basal cisterns are within normal limits.
Air-fluid levels are demonstrated within all of the paranasal
sinuses consistent with history of intubation. The mastoid air
cells are clear. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect.

BRAIN MRI: On diffusion images, there is no evidence of slow
diffusion seen to indicate acute infarct. There is no midline
shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus identified. There are few
small foci of T2 hyperintensity in this subcortical white matter
of both frontal lobes, of nonspecific nature and not typical for
demyelinating disease. There is no territorial infarct seen.
Following gadolinium administration, there is no evidence of
abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement
identified. Mild mucosal thickening is seen in both maxillary
sinuses.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of acute infarct or abnormal enhancement.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA is limited by motion. No evidence of vascular
occlusion or high- grade stenosis seen in the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation. Evaluation for distal
vertebral arteries, proximal basilar artery and petrous and
cavernous portions of the carotid arteries is limited by motion.
IMPRESSION: Motion limited normal MRA of the head demonstrates
no evidence of significant abnormalities.

EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of
slow and disorganized background with a generalized burst of
delta
frequency slowing. These findings suggest an encephalopathy. No
lateralization or epileptiform abnormalities were seen. Sinus
tachycardia was noted.

24 hour EEG: This 24 hour discontinuous EEG recording is
remarkable for
background activity suggesting a mild to moderate
encephalopathy. No
evidence for ongoing seizures is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20149**] is a 49 year old who presented with acute MI, status
post stent and placement of balloon pump. Upon presentation he
was in cardiogenic shock, intubated and on pressors. Per
history, he had been intubated and was in the cath lab within 50
minutes of his presenting symptoms. He was hypotensive to the
SBP 50's briefly.

For the standpoint of the coronaries, he was stented x 1, and
integrellin and heparin were discontinued early because of acute
bleed from the groin. He was started on aspirin, Plavix, and
atorvastatin 80 mg. An echocardiogram revealed EF 15-20%, with
akinesis of the apex. He remained in sinus tachycardia
throughout his hospitalization and eventually responded to beta
blockade. For his akinetic left ventricle, Mr. [**Known lastname 20149**] was
anticoagulated. He was sent home on warfarin with a Lovenox
bridge. A 3 month course of warfarin is anticipated.

Mr. [**Known lastname 20149**] developed blood loss anemia from his groin hematoma.
He suffered an iliac laceration and was transfused with PRBCs.

While intubated, Mr. [**Known lastname 20149**] was noted to have right eye
deviation in the setting of flexion of his upper extremities.
This was thought to perhaps represent a seizure. He was started
on IV Ativan and loaded with phenytoin. A head CT was
unrevealing. This was followed with a negative head MR and
negative EEG (both short and 24 hour). His right eye deviation
resolved, and he had no other neurological deficits. His
sedation was lightened and once the patient was following
commands, he was extubated.

Mr. [**Known lastname 20149**] has DM II. Initially his metformin was held and he
was given acetylcysteine and bicarbonate to protect his kidneys
from the dye load. In the interim, he was started on a regular
insulin sliding scale. His metformin was restarted with
excellent glycemic control before discharge.

Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 20149**] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] fevers and was pancultured. He was
noted to have a urinary tract infection which resolved once the
Foley catheter was pulled and he was treated with levofloxacin.

Since he has a low EF, Mr. [**Known lastname 20149**] was assessed by the
electrophysiology service for placement of a defibrillator. He
elected not to have the procedure at this time since he felt as
though some of his neu
