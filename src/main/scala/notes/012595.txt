Chief Complaint:
Palpitations

History of Present Illness:
78F w/ hx CAD s/p CABG, chronic systolic CHF (EF- 25%), VT s/p
pacemaker w/ recent admission for recurrent VTach
([**Date range (1) 20095**]). Patient awoke this morning to palpitations, took
her dofetilide as instructed then called EMS. Pt reports that
yesterday afternoon she felt some lightheadedness after
showering with some mild palpitations, but this resolved with
rest and taking oxazepam.  Pt reports intermittent palpitations
throughout today lasting a few seconds.  Denies CP, SOB,
dizziness, nausea, diaphoresis today.

Noted enroute to [**Hospital3 **] ED today to have several runs of
VTach, unknown duration, patient does think ICD fired but
unsure. She complains of "spasms" in her chest muscles and her
legs that have continued but states the palpitations have
improved. No episodes of VT at [**Hospital3 **] although noted to have
frequent PVCs, was given 1L NS there. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
EP eval.

Recent hospital course for VT admission, discharged yesterday
[**8-11**]. Briefly, admitted with multiple episodes of stable VTach
with  multiple discharges from ICD. Stabilized on lidocaine gtt
w/ resolution of VTach. Patient requested ICD function turned
off, but after discussion w/ EP her ICD was left on but settings
changed to reduce number of shocks she would receive. Dofetilide
125mcg [**Hospital1 **] was started and lidocaine weaned. No recurrent VT and
discharged home.

On interrogation of ICD: 4am had VTach, then 3 bursts of ATP
that terminated, 430a had more VTach with 6 bursts of ATP that
spontaneously resolved, (not with ATP), no LOC. VTach at 150
bpm.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.0 62 121/56 16 95%. She denied
SOB or CP. Labs and imaging significant for normal Troponin x1,
normal chemistry including K 4.1 and Mg 1.9, normal CBC and
coags, negative UA. EKG showed PR prolongation, RBBB, and
frequent PVC's.

Patient given oxazepam x1 PO in ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
78F with h/o CAD and cardiomyopathy with EF 25% and recurrent VT
recently hospitalized [**Date range (3) 20096**] for VT storm, admitted for
palpitations and found to have runs of VT.

Ventricular Tachycardia:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service [**8-12**]. Was placed on sotalol
and dofetilide for her V tach. She was taken for ablation of V
tach on [**8-13**]. Received substrate ablation with large scar across
her inferior wall on lateral and septal edge and put lines
across the scar from lateral to septum. After successful
procedure, patient was transferred to CCU team for
post-procedural monitoring. Sotalol and dofetilide were d/c'ed.

HTN:
Patient's HTN regimen was altered during hospitalization.
Isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine were d/c'ed and patient was
started on Valsartan 80mg with good response.

Restless Leg Syndrome:
Patient suffers from chronic restless leg syndrome. She was
started on ferrous sulfate 325mg daily and will continue this
med as an outpatient.

Anxiety:
She was also quite nervous and anxious during her
hospitalization. She is known to have baseline anxiety. She
should be considered for SSRI therapy as an outpatient.

CAD:
For her CAD, she was continued on home statin, ezetimibe, ASA,
and metoprolol.

Transitional Issues

-Patient will F/U as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Friday [**8-21**] for her successfully ablated VT.
-She is a candidate for SSRI therapy.
-Her BP should be monitored on new BP regimen (stopped
isosorbide and hydralizine, started valsartan)
-Assess response of restless leg syndrome to Ferrous sulfate
