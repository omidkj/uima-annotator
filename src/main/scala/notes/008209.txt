CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68 year old female
with end-stage renal disease previously on hemodialysis with
multiple access problems.  She was recently switched to
peritoneal dialysis about three weeks ago.  She presents
today with one day history of abdominal pain, fevers, chills
and shaking, which all started last night.  Peritoneal
dialysis went in last night without any difficulty; no
nausea, vomiting, no change in her bowel symptoms.  The
patient makes minimal urine at baseline.  The patient was
complaining of aching abdominal pain which has subsided to
some extent.  The patient denies chest pain or shortness of
breath.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was given her Dilaudid and
was also given one gram of Ancef as empiric treatment for a
question of an infected sacral decubitus.  There was an
initial thought that the patient's symptoms represented
bacterial peritonitis from the peritoneal dialysis catheter.
Fluid was obtained and sent for cell counts and differential
and culture to rule out bacterial peritonitis.  [**Known lastname 1007**] blood
cell count in the ascitic fluid was only 24.  At that time,
no further work-up was done by the medical team for bacterial
peritonitis.  It was felt that the leading diagnosis at the
time was an infected draining purulent left buttock abscess.

Meanwhile, while in the Emergency Room, the patient's blood
pressure had dropped initially from 140/60 to the 80s
systolic and at one point dropping to as low as 65 systolic
while in the Emergency Room.  The patient received about two
liters of fluid and received Vancomycin and Ceptaz
intravenously.  It was noted that the patient's fever was
down to 98.7 F., with improvement of the systolic blood
pressure to the 130s.  A CT scan of the abdomen which was
done in the Emergency Room showed a small decubitus abscess
with extensive inflammation in the right buttock area.
Surgery was consulted in the Emergency Room and drained
abscess and packed it with sterile gauze.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.7 F.;
heart rate 90; systolic blood pressure in the 130s over 60.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  Neck was supple.  Lungs clear to
auscultation anteriorly and laterally.  Heart examination:
S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops
were appreciated.  Abdominal examination showed normoactive
bowel sounds, mild tenderness at the peritoneal dialysis
catheter site.  No erythema.  The left buttock had a purulent
and bloody drainage, a 1 cm lesion which probed down to at
least 3 to 4 cm.  Extremities were status post amputation of
the left index finger, the right third and fifth fingers, and
a left below the knee amputation.

LABORATORY:  On admission, [**Known lastname **] blood cell count 14,600,
hematocrit 31.6, platelets 257,000, 90% neutrophils, zero
bands, 5 lymphocytes.  PT was 22.9, PTT was 54.2; INR was
3.6.  Magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 6.2.  Lactate 3.9.  Sodium
138, potassium 6.8 which was hemolyzed.  Chloride 98,
bicarbonate 26, BUN 47, creatinine 8.2.  Glucose 88, AST 59,
ALT 18, alkaline phosphatase 74, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin
3.1, amylase 100, lipase 0.  Blood cultures and wound
cultures were drawn in the Emergency Room.

The ascites showed amylase of 4, [**Known lastname **] blood cell count of
24.

Wound Gram stain showed two plus PMM, one plus Gram positive
cocci in pairs.

CT scan abdomen showed sacral decubitus abscess in the right
buttock region and sacral region with a destructive lesion in
the sacrum.  Question of chronic osteomyelitis.  There was no
abscess present in the peritoneum.

Chest x-ray showed increased pulmonary vascularity with
blunting of the costophrenic angles with mild retrocardiac
opacity.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis secondary
    to multiple access issues with hemodialysis.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease status post left below the
    knee amputation and finger amputations.

12. Chronic anemia.

ALLERGIES:  To aspirin.
