Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (un) 85086**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, cough, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy and endobronchial debulking of squamous cell
lung mass [**10-21**]
Endotracheal intubation [**10-21**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10689**] is a 62 y/o man w/ recently-diagnosed LUL
poorly-differentiated squamous cell lung cancer admitted for
hypotension and fever secondary to a post-obstructive pneumonia.
 Patient had back pain, weight loss, and productive cough with
mild hemoptysis at the beginning of [**Month (only) **]; [**Month (only) **] at that time
revealed a LUL opacity.  F/U CT thorax on [**10-8**] revealed LUL mass
5 x 6.7 cm concerning for malignancy.  On [**10-14**], patient underwent
a flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsies, and a
linear endobronchial ultrasound with lymph node biopsies (both
procedures performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Endobronchial biopsies
revealed poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

Patient presented to PCP's (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] Angels) office with
worsening cough, fever and weakness on [**10-20**].  Vitals at PCP's
office were:  101.7, SBP 82/52, tachycardic to 115, and
breathing 98% on RA; had diminished L upper lung breath sounds,
per PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] on [**10-20**] revealed new infiltrate peripheral to the
mass lesions; likely consistent with PNA. He was referred to the
ED by PCP at that time.

In the ED, vitals were:  99.0, 88/65, 93, and 96% on 2L.  [**Month/Year (2) **]
done in ED also showed likely post-obstructive PNA.  Patient was
given 3L NS, 1 gram IV vancomycin, and 750 mg PO levofloxacin,
and sent to the MICU.  Started on ampicillin/sulbactam (unasyn)
and continued on levofloxacin in the MICU.  Hypotension was
stablized- proven to be fluid responsive.  Breathing comfortably
on 4 L oxygen.  LUL mass thought to be obstructing airway- OR
endobronchial debulking performed this afternoon, [**2190-10-21**], prior
to transfer from MICU to the floor; suggested by IP consult.
Patient's procedure was c/b hypoventilation and PaCO2 noted at
one point to be > than 100.  Mechanical ventilation/intubation
in PACU lowered PaCO2 to ~ mid-50's and patient was extubated,
then transferred to the floor (O2 saturation > 90%).

.
CT Chest with Contrast ([**10-20**]):
1. Enlarging left upper lobe mass with left upper bronchial
stenosis, at the level of stenosis the pulmonary artery is less
than 11mm posterior to the bronchus. Encasement of the left
upper lobe pulmonary artery and
post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. New bilateral small pleural effusions.
3. New left basal pneumonia, probably aspiration of left upper
lobe contents.
.
Interval Results:
.
MRI Head With and Without Contrast ([**10-23**]):
No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
.
CT Chest Without Contrast ([**10-23**]):
1. Progression of left upper lobe atelectasis and consolidation
as above.
2. Status post recent debridement with gas in the area of the
previously seen lesion and re-opening of the left upper lobe
bronchus, as above. There is stenosis of the left upper lobe
bronchus, however there is mild increase in aeration of the
apicoposterior segment with peripheral dilated bronchioles.
3. Progression of ground-glass and consolidation in left lower
lobe, possibly related to aspiration and in part to compressive
atelectasis due to enlarging left pleural effusion.
4. Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
5. Unchanged lymphadenopathy.
.
Pleural Fluid Analysis ([**10-24**]): 4+ PMNs, no organisms, fluid
culture without growth, anaerobic culture without growth.
.
FDG Tumor Imaging ([**10-26**]):
1. FDG avid left upper lobe consolidation, with more focally
increased FDG avidity surrounding a narrowed left upper lobe
bronchus,
compatible with the known squamous cell carcinoma with
post-obstructive collapse and consolidation of the left upper
lobe.
2. FDG avid consolidation of the left lower lobe and lingula,
likely pneumonia or aspiration.
3. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
4. FDG avid mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
5. Trace free fluid in the pelvis.
.
Chest CT With Contrast ([**11-2**]):
1. Interval improvement in left upper lobe post-obstructive
pneumonia with
improved aeration of the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe.
Foci of gas within this consolidated parenchyma are similar in
appearance, and potential communication between a left upper
lobe segmental bronchus and these collections of air is
possible. Known mass lesion is not well evaluated due to
surrounding consolidation.
2. Slight interval increase in left pleural effusion. Resolution
of right
pleural effusion.
3. Extensive lymphadenopathy, unchanged. It is unclear what
component is
reactive versus involved with malignancy.
.
Ultrasound with Doppler of Lower Extremities ([**11-2**]):
Non-occlusive thrombosis of bilateral popliteal, the right
peroneal and the left posterior tibialis veins.
.
Blood Cultures were repeated 9 times during admission and were
always without growth.
.
Chest X-Rays were repeated 11 times throughout admission and
demonstrated left upper lobe post-obstructive pneumonia with
little to no improvement. Images later in stay further revealed
almost complete white out of the left lung with collapse of the
left lower lobe detected late in the hospital course.
.
Mediastinal Lymph Node Biopsy ([**11-12**]):
1.  Lymph node, 4R, biopsy (A-D): No malignancy identified.
2.  Lymph node, 4L, biopsy (E-F): No malignancy identified.
3.  Lymph node, level 7, biopsy (G-H): No malignancy identified.
4.  Lymph node, 2R, biopsy (I): No malignancy identified.
5.  Lymph node, 2L, biopsy (J): No malignancy identified.
