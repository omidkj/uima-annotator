[**2161-12-22**] pa/lat cxr:
Increased cardiomegaly with mild engorgement of pulmonary
vessels
and basilar atelectasis and trace pleural effusion. Findings may
represent
early failure.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2161-12-23**] at 4:18:14 PM      FINAL
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Trivial pericardial effusion. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global
systolic function. Mild right ventricular dilatation and global
hypokinesis. Large pleural effusion.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2161-4-22**] (images reviewed),
pulmonary pressures are higher. Right ventricular systolic
dysfunction is new. A large pleural effusion is now noted.
.
CXR [**12-25**]
Severe cardiomegaly is stable. Worsening left lower lobe
consolidation is
worrisome for progression of pneumonia. Left mid lung plate-like
atelectasis
is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. If any, there is a small
left
pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
IR procedure [**12-28**]
IMPRESSION: Successful conversion of temporary to tunneled
hemodialysis
catheter through the right internal jugular vein approach. The
tip is located
in the right atrium and the catheter is ready for use.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F with CKD stage 5 peri-RRT, COPD, DM II with
complications and hypertension who was admitted with
hypertensive emergency, volume overload, hypoxemia, demand
ischemia and worsening uremia.
.
# demand ischemia/NSTEMI: Patient intially presented with
hypertensive urgency and was found to have an elevated troponin
with flat MB likely elevated in the setting of CKD and possible
demand ischemia. However despite improvement of blood pressures,
she subsequently experienced chest pain that was not responsive
to antacids but improved with nitroglycerin. Patient found to
have elevated troponin and CK-MB without ECG changes. Given
concern for ACS, she was evaluated by cardiology and it was felt
that elevated biomarkers were most likely [**12-17**] to poor BP control
and volume overload. Patient was treated for 48 hours with a
heparin gtt. Troponins continue to be elevated but CKMB
downtrended and patient remained chest pain free. She was
medically managed with ASA, statin, bblocker, imdur and improved
blood pressure control. She was discharged with plans to
establish care with a cardiologist.
.
# CKD stage V: Patient presented with symptoms of volume
overload and lethargy likely [**12-17**] to worsening renal function.
Patient had L. fistula placed but not yet mature. Renal team was
consulted in the ICU and agreed dialysis likely necessary, but
did not see urgent need for dialysis as medication
non-compliance large component to volume overload, pleural
effusions, and hypertensive urgency.  However, patient continued
to be somnolent and the decision was made to place a tunneled
line and start dialysis. Patient underwent 3 sessions of
dialysis and somnolence and volume status improved. She was
continued on bumex 2 mg daily given that she still makes some
urine. She was also continued on calcium carbonate, sevelemer
and nephr
