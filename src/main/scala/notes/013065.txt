Admission Date:  [**2199-3-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2199-3-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**2140-12-29**]       Sex:  M

Service:  VASCULAR

ADDENDUM:  The initial discharge summary was dictated on
[**2199-3-19**].  This is an addendum from [**2199-3-19**] to [**2199-4-1**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a duplex of the graft
which showed no stenosis and the graft was patent.  He
continued to be followed by the medical service for his
multiple medical problems which include gouty arthritis,
chronic congestive failure.  We are also awaiting final
recommendations of Podiatry and Plastics regarding right
calcanectomy and flap procedure.

The patient's gout improved with low-dose colchicine instead
of using steroids which would interfere with any wound
healing.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was requested to see the patient.  The patient is
part of the program Advanced Cardiac Failure Program.  Their
recommendations were to help diminish peripheral vascular
edema.  He had severe dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to
coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes with
systolic dysfunction and ejection fraction less than 20%.  He
has no overt signs of fluid overload.  His JVD is 8 cm at 30
degrees and he has 1+ pitting edema.  Recommendations were
daily weights and restrict sodium in diet to 2 grams per 24
hours as well as a 2 liter fluid restriction over 24 hours.

Their recommendation was also to discontinue the
nonsteroidals secondary to renal function and cardiac
dysfunction.

It was noted while awaiting final decision on surgical date,
that the patient's hematocrit drifted to 22.  He required 2
units of packed red cell transfusion with the onset of acute
right leg pain and swelling of his leg.  The patient
continued to require multiple transfusions with serial
hematocrits.

On [**2199-3-25**], he went to the Vascular Lab.  His right
[**Doctor Last Name **]-pedal graft was patent.  There was no pseudoaneurysm
noted either in the proximal or distal anastomosis.  The
patient received another 2 units of packed red blood cells
with Lasix between.  Heparin was held.  His hematocrit
finally stabilized at 26.8 on [**2199-3-27**].  A CT demonstrated no
retroperitoneal bleeding but a hematoma in the AK [**Doctor Last Name **] space.
Serial hematocrits were continued to be monitored and the
patient was prepared for surgery.

He underwent a right thigh hematoma evacuation on [**2199-3-28**].
He require 1 unit of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.
The findings showed a large deep space thrombus evacuated
oozing of the great saphenous vein tunnel.  This was
cauterized.  The bleeding was controlled.  The wound was
closed.

The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.
His hematocrit was 29.6.  He continued to do well and was
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.
EPS was requested to see the patient and re-interrogate his
pacer after a Swan-Ganz had been placed.  This was on
[**2199-3-28**].  This was interrogated.

On [**2199-3-29**], the patient's Swan-Ganz was removed under
fluoroscopy without incident.  His hematocrit remained stable
at 27.5.  Ambulation was begun on [**2199-3-30**].  The Foley was
discontinued.  The second JP drain was removed.  The patient
was transferred to the regular nursing floor for continued
care.

He was seen by Physical Therapy who felt that he would
require discharge to rehabilitation prior to returning home.
The patient remained strict nonweightbearing on the affected
right foot.  Silvadene was applied to the skin areas b.i.d.
The patient will continue on his antibiotics two weeks
postdischarge and then be seen by Plastics, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and
Podiatry before planning Podiatry Plastic procedure.
