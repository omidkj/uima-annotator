Chief Complaint:
Post-cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] is a 73yoF with h/o bipolar d/o on Lithium who is
transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest. Patient is currently
unable to provide history, therefore details of HPI are obtained
from family and OSH records.  Per pt's family, pt had c/o
flu-like sx a week ago, with URI sx and cough.  Had also had
progressive DOE for past few weeks, to the point that she became
dyspneic when walking from her apartment to parking lot (~100
feet).  No h/o cardiac disease, however recently had stress test
which was reportedly negative and was scheduled to see
cardiologist this week.  Today the elevator in her apartment
building was broken, and when walking up 2 flights of stairs to
her apartment she became extremely SOB and called for help.  EMS
was called, started CPAP but she did not tolerate it, became
agitated, then became bradycardic and suffered asystolic arrest.
 CPR was started and she receieved epi 1mg x3 and lidocaine 100
in field then was taken to OSH.  At OSH ED received atropine x2
and additional epi x4.  Total time to ROSC estimated 25 minutes.
 She received chilled saline at OSH and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**], with T 33.9 en route.

In the ED, initial VS were T 33F, HR 85, BP 90/40 on dopa 20mcg
and epi 12.5mcg. GCS 3, not responding to commands but
withdrawing to painful stimuli.  Labs were notable for pH 6.94,
pCO2 64, HCO3 15, lactate 9.9. EKG showed sinus rhythm with LAD
and RBBB, low voltage.  (Of note initial ECG at OSH had anterior
STE, but resolved.)  Bedside TTE showed no RV enlargement,
global hypokinesis with depressed LVEF, c/w post-arrest. No
significant valvular disease. FAST exam negative. CTA showed no
PE but large bibasilar consolidations c/w aspiration pna.
Post-arrest consult team was consulted for initiation of arctic
sun cooling protocol. Epi gtt was increased to max, and she was
started on neo gtt. She received IV vancomycin 1g x1, IV
cefepime 2g x1, and IV levofloxacin 500mg x1.  She was admitted
to MICU for arctic sun cooling protocol.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is intubated and sedated.  Vitals T
32.2F, HR 103, BP 97/70, O2 sat 94% on 100% FIO2.

Past Medical History:
-Bipolar disorder
-Severe asthma requiring hospitalizations years ago, no
exacerbations for many years (not currently treated)

Social History:
Per family, pt lives in [**Hospital3 4634**] but is very independent
with ADLs.  Occ smoking (1 pack per month), no EtOH or drug use.


Family History:
Notable for CAD in patient's parents and siblings, but no known
h/o sudden cardiac death.

IMAGING:

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2116-10-19**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
recent infarction. The ventricles and sulci are age appropriate
in
appearance. Areas of periventricular and subcortical white
matter hypodensity likely reflect sequela of chronic small
vessel ischemic disease. No concerning osseous lesion or
fracture is identified. There are air-fluid levels within the
nasopharynx and mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air
cells, compatible with intubation. The mastoid air cells are
grossly clear.  There is minimal mucosal thickening of the right
maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.

CTA CHEST [**2116-10-19**]
FINDINGS: There are massive bilateral dependent consolidations.

Additionally, within the aerated portions of the lungs, there
are bilateral ground-glass opacities extending from the hila.
Additional nodular opacities are likely related to acute
process, though no prior exams are available for comparison.

A small amount of free air is noted along the left base. While
this is not
clearly localized, there is suggestion on coronal images
(601B:24-26) that the collection is above the diaphragm and
within the pleural space.

The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified and no filling
defect to suggest pulmonary embolism is seen. No evidence of
acute aortic syndrome is identified. There are coronary artery
calcifications. No pericardial
effusion is seen.

The patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube tip low
lying at the level of the carina. Additionally, the balloon of
the endotracheal tube appears hyperinflated.  There is a
left-sided subclavian central venous catheter with tip reaching
the SVC.

An esophageal catheter is in place, incompletely imaged;
however, coursing to the stomach at least.

No lymphadenopathy is identified.

The left thyroid lobe is enlarged. Limited views of the upper
abdomen
demonstrate at least two calcified splenic artery aneurysms.

Bone windows demonstrate a nondisplaced sternal fracture
(602B:34), which may be related to chest compressions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Massive bilateral dependent consolidations, compatible with
aspiration.  Ground-glass opacities consistent with pulmonary
edema.
2. Air collection at the left base felt more likely above the
diaphragm
representing small pneumothorax vs bulla as opposed to contained
within the peritoneum. In comparison with prior radiographs of
the chest, it appears this was present prior to placement of
central line.
3. Low-lying endotracheal tube with tip at the level of the
carina and
hyperinflation of the endotracheal tube balloon.
4. Enlargement of the left thyroid lobe.
5. Non-displaced sternal fracture may be related to chest
compressions.

TTE [**2116-10-20**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with distal septal hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild systolic
dysfunction. Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
73yo F with history of bipolar d/o transferred from OSH s/p
asystolic cardiac arrest, likely secondary to respiratory
etiology.
