feeling SOB which was quickly relieved with her inhaler.  The
day before presentation to the hospital, she not only had
symptoms at night, she also started to experience SOB, chest
tightness and wheezing throughout the day.  She used her inhaler
approximately 10 times but experienced no relief, she then used
her cousin??????s albuterol nebulizer because she was too weak to go
through her un-packed moving boxes to find her own.  She gave
herself 2 treatments with no relief of symptoms.  Her aunt,
concerned about her lack of improvement called 911.

At baseline, Ms. [**Known lastname **] uses her inhaler approximately twice per
day and states that she normally does not have to use it at
night.  She states that for the past 3-4 years she feels that

stress, cats, pollen, flowers, perfume and possibly exercise.

to her room. She has also been w/o her allergy pillows since the
