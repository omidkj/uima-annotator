History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82224**] is an 83 yr old male who was admitted to [**Hospital1 9191**] with increasing shortness of breath. He states that on
the morning of his admission to the OSH, he woke up with cough
and inability to catch his breath. Studies during his admission
to the OSH included an echocardiogram which reportedly showed
mitral regurgitation with partial flail leaflet. He was ruled
out for myocardial infarction. Pt initially treated
conservatively with diuretics but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8098**] did not feel that
the pt has improved clinically. He was subsequently referred pt
for cardiac catheterizaton and possible surgical intervention.
Of ntoe, he has a new diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. On arrival here, he states, he still has DOE and
cough productive of clear phlegm. Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of chest pain, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope. He does state he has had PND for the last
1 month, DOE worsening for last 5 months and felt presyncopal
when during the episode which resulted in his admission to the
OSH.

[**2156-3-23**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
no angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial disease of
the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed
elevated biventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 12 mm Hg
and LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.  PASP was elevated at 54 mm HG.  Mean
PCWP was 25 mm Hg; v waves were present up to 35 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressures were decreased with aortic systolic
pressure of 92 mm Hg.  Cardiac index was 2.32 l/min/m2. 3.  Left
ventriculography revealed [**2-18**]+ mitral regurgitation. LVEF was
60%.
[**2156-3-24**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There
is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is partial mitral leaflet flail.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Single insignificant calcific focus of plaque involving the
right internal carotid artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82224**] was admitted under cardiology with congestive
heart failure. The following day, he underwent cardiac
catheterization which confirmed to have severe mitral
regurgitation. Angiography showed normal coronary arteries, and
right heart cath showed moderate pulmonary hypertension - see
result section for additional details. He developed worsening
hypoxia/dyspnea and required transfer to the CCU for closer
observation and intravenous diuretics. Given paroxsymal atrial
fibrillation, he was anticoagulated with intravenous Heparin.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and further preoperative
evaluation was performed - see result section for details. Prior
to surgery, dental extractions were performed without
complication.  He otherwise remained stable on medical therapy
and was eventually cleared for surgery.

On [**3-29**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed mitral valve replacement
and tricuspid valve repair. Please see operative note for
surgical detail. Given inpatient stay was greater than 24 hours
prior to surgery, Vancomycin was used for perioperative
antibiotic coverage. Following the operation, he was brought to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He was
gradually weaned from pressor support and transferred to the
telemetry floor on postoperative day two.

Beta blockade was resumed as he continued to experience
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter. K and Mg were monitored
closely and repleted per protocol. Low dose beta blockade was
not advanced as he remained rate controlled and he
intermittently experienced a junctional rhythm. Given persistent
atrial fibrillation with bioprosthetic mitral valve, Warfarin
anticoagulation was initiated and dosed for a goal INR between
2.0 - 2.5. He tolerated low dose beta blockade and at discharge
was noted to be in a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV
block, rate of 70 and blood pressure of 101/64.

His postoperative course was also complicated by urinary
re
