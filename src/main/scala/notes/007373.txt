an increase in his liver enzymes in [**Month (only) **].  A liver biopsy
was performed which revealed drug induced hepatitis, a question
of early recurrent hepatitis C, but no signs of acute rejection.

A hepatitis C viral load was checked and it was negative.  2
weeks ago his bilirubin was noted to be elevated.  He underwent
an ERCP today which revealed a complete obstruction at the
biliary anastomosis.  He [**Month (only) **] fevers, chills and jaundice.  He

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2106-12-29**] after ERCP revealed a biliary
stricture.  The patient underwent PTC drain placement initially;
however, the drain would not pass the obstruction and therefore
only drained externally.  On [**1-6**] the patient underwent a
hepaticojejunostomy to correct the biliary stricture.

On [**1-8**], the patient was noted to have acute onset of
respiratory distress.  An ABG showed 7.45/32/57 and the patient
was intubated.  CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.  A
bedside echo was performed and showed new anterior hypokinesis
with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum; overall LVEF of
25-35%.  Noted to be hypotensive to the 80s, tachycardic to the
120s.  He was taken to cardiac catheterization for further
evaluation.  Cardiac cath revealed 3 vessel disease. Bare mental
stents were placed in the LAD and RCA.  Given persistent shock a
balloon pump was placed in the cath lab and he was brought to
the CCU.

He had been started on vanc and zosyn prior to transfer and
these were continued given concern for sepsis as a cuase for his
persistent hypotension.  He was also placed on dopamine for
pressure support.  Fluconazole was added for fungal coverage as
the patient is immunosuppressed.  The patient's abominal
surgical wound continued to leak bile throughout his stay in the
CCU.  An abdominal US was done to evaluate for fluid collection
which showed no large perihepatic fluid collection and a small
right pleural effusion.

A repeat TTE was done on and off the ballon pump on [**1-10**] which
showed improved systolic function but he continued to have
distal inferior wall hypokinesis and distal septal hypokinesis.
The balloon pump removed on [**1-10**]. He was extubated on [**1-11**].

On POD 5 cholangiogram showed a complete obstruction of this
anastomosis.  He therefore returned to the operating room on POD
7, for exploration and revision.

On [**1-12**] a HIDA scan was performed which showed a bile leak from
the hepaicojejunostomy anastomosis.  He was very confused and
require 1:1 sitters.  On [**1-16**] the patient was transferred back
to the transplant floor.  A follow up cholangiogram determined
the patient's bile leak to actually have been coming from the
liver edge rather than the anastomosis.  The patient therefore
continued to have JP drainage.  A CT scan was performed which
showed a 6 x 3 cm collection that was not drainable.  The
patient's diet was slowly advanced and tolerated.

On the 24th, the patient had his roux tube capped which was well
tolerated.  He was sent home on the 25th on oral levaquin with
JP drainage, a capped roux tube, and with plans to attend
cardiac rehab in the near future.
