Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis and drain


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 43 yo M with PMHx sig. ESRD s/p failed transplant and
subsequent nephrectomy in [**8-7**] who p/w abdominal pain. He was
recently hospitalized from [**Date range (3) 20750**] for worsening dyspnea
and abdominal pain. He was admitted to the MICU for urgent HD as
he missed his previous HD session. He also developed chest pain
attributed to new onset systolic CHF (?SIRS related to graft
rejection and recent nephrectomy, ischemia, or high output
failure form AV fistula) and pericarditis [**1-31**] uremia. The
abdominal pain was felt to be localized over the nephrectomy
site, and serial exams did not show a surgical abdomen. He was
noted to have new isolated elevated AST; an abdominal US did not
show gallbladder pathology. It did show 4.7 x 2.2 x 2.9 cm
thick-walled fluid collection in RLQ, decreased in size from
[**2161-8-21**]. Pt was treated with acetaminophen and low dose IV
morphine. His course with comblicated by gram-positive
bacteremia, likely from HD line. He was treated with vancomycin
for 2 week course.
.
He returns today with worsening abdominal pain, now for past 3
weeks, and poor appetite.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were: . He had an abdominal CT
scan that showed no infectious processes. The CT scan did show
new ascites and pericardial effusion, which was not seen on
cardiac MRI on [**2161-9-21**]. Cardiology performed a bedside ECHO that
showed large effusion but NO cardiac tamponade physiology. His P
stable. Pulsus is 6. The plan is to have cardiology take him to
the cath lab tomorrow. Renal has been notified of his arrival
and will likely need to dialysis him post-cath. Of note, his CT
scan was complicated by infiltration of his IV. About 70 cc of
contrast was run into his arm. Per protocol, plastic surgery was
consulted to eval for compartment syndrome. Plastics felt exam
was benign and recommended warm compresses.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope

=========================================
EKG
Prolonged Q-T interval. Low voltage in the standard leads. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes in leads
I, aVL and V2-V6. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2161-10-7**] no
significant change. The non-specific T wave changes are similar.
The QTc interval is somewhat shorter.
=========================================
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
1. No retroperitoneal bleed.
2. Interval decrease in size of the pericardial effusion, now
small.
3. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on
the right
and small on the left, with associated atectasis at the lung
bases.
==========================================
[**Last Name (un) **] study
Flow study demonstrates no fibrin sheath or significant thrombus

of existing left-sided tunneled hemodialysis catheter.
==========================================
PA LATERAL
Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased, moderate
enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial
effusion is
diminished, interstitial edema is cleared and bibasilar
opacification has
improved. Overall findings are consistent with resolved
pulmonary edema.
Cystic structure at the right lung apex now contains fluid,
probably edema
fluid in a bulla, not concerning for infection. Dual-channel
supraclavicular left-sided central venous catheter projects over
the upper right atrium. No complications.
===========================================
TTE [**10-5**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size is mildly
increased with normal free wall motion. There is abnormal
diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small
circumferential pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
