History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 yo F with PMH DM2 on metformin, asthma,
recent admission [**Date range (1) 108031**] for CAP/asthma exacerbation and new
onset afib sent home on coumadin and diltiazem who presented to
the emergency department complaining of dizziness. Her HR was
noted to be 50 upon presentation. She was diaphoretic and
complaining of n/v. She reported that she took one extra ER
diltiazem today out of confusion. She was just started on this
medication. She denies f/c, abd pain, diarrhea/constipation,
chest pain, headache, confusion. She reports worse SOB,
orthopnea. She denies any other changes other than coumadin,
diltiazem.
.
In the ED, VS were 106/42, HR 50, AF. She received 4mg calcium
gluconate, 2mg atropine as well as zofran, reglan, and compazine
for n/v. She was put on an insulin drip and peripheral dopa for
chronotropy. Her lactate was noted to be over 10. She was given
vanc and cefepime. Her gas was 7.24/34/90 and she had new renal
failure at 2.1 (bl 1.1). Renal saw her in the ED as did tox.
Before transfer to the MICU, her HR had improved to 85, BP
114/32, and she was satting 100% on 3L. She received 3L NS.
.
Of note she was recently admitted from [**12-19**] -[**12-27**] for CAP and
asthma exacerbation. She failed outpatient tx with azithromycin
and was changed to levaquin, for which she finished a 6 day
course on [**2133-12-24**].
.
On the floor her only complaint is SOB. Her HR is in the 80s.
Her SBP is in the 110s, though her MAP is < 60.

studies:
CXR [**2133-12-29**]:
FINDINGS: There has been minimal improved aeration of the right
lung base with persistent opacity noted. There is a more linear
opacity noted in the lateral aspects of the right mid lung near
an area of remote chronic healed rib fractures which may
represent scarring. The previously noted mild volume overload
has somewhat subsided to near resolution. There is mild
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is
within normal limits for size accounting for patient and
technical factors. The right costophrenic angle is again
blunted, possibly due to a small pleural effusion. No left
effusion is seen. There is no underlying pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Relative to the most recent prior exam, there is an
improved aeration of the right lung base with persistent
opacity, possibly reflecting a resolving pneumonia with a small
parapneumonic effusion.
.
Renal u/s [**2133-12-31**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis in
either the right or left kidney
.
ECG: Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-12-30**]
there is no significant change.
.
ECHO [**2134-1-5**]:
 The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-4-11**],
mitral regurgitation appears slightly more prominent


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 yo F with PMH of asthma, DM2, HTN, recent
admission for PNA treated with levaquin x6 days, presenting with
bradycardia, hypotension, lactic acidosis and acute renal
failure.
.
1) Bradycardia: Based on her report of taking extra long acting
diltiazem, her bradycardia and hypotension likely [**3-14**] diltiazem
overdose.  In addition, she was in acute renal failure on
admission which also likely contributed to CCB toxicity.  She
was evaluated by toxicology consult in the ED who agreed with
this assessment.  She was started on insuling gtt for CCB
toxicity and started on dopamine gtt for hemodynamic support.
She was admitted to the ICU and her heart rate and blood
pressure improved by the morning after admission and her insulin
and dopamine were able to be weaned off in less than 24 hours.
All nodal agents were held for the first 24 hours after which
she was titrated up on metoprolol (to 100mg PO BID) and
diltiazem 240 mg SR (her home dose) for HR control.

2)Lactic acidosis: She had a lactic acidosis on admission which
resolved with IVF most likely [**3-14**] to metformin in the setting of
acute on chronic renal failure.  Her metformin was discontinued
and will not be restarted on discharge given the lactic
acidosis.

3)Hypotension/BP control: She was initially on dopamine gtt due
to hypotension thought most likely due to both Diltiazem
toxicity and sepsis given that she also had an elevated WBC
count and was hypothermic on admission.  She was covered broadly
on admission to the ICU to cover for partially treated
nosocomial pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn, beginning on
[**2133-12-29**].  Hypotension resolved the morning after admission once
her HR recoverd and she was weaned off the dopamine gtt with
