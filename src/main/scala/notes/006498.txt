70, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 93% on two liters.
The patient is afebrile.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination - normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  No lymphadenopathy, no
jugular venous distention.  The heart is regular rate and
rhythm, positive S1 and S2.  Lungs reveal bilateral
expiratory wheeze, no crackles.  Abdomen - positive bowel
sounds, nontender, nondistended, soft.  Extremities - no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no calf tenderness.  Distal
pulses palpable bilaterally.  Strength is [**5-1**] throughout.
Neurologic examination - Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Psychiatric - alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 9.8,
hematocrit 36.8, platelets 238,000.  INR 2.1.  Sodium 137,
potassium 4.5, chloride 100, bicarbonate 23, blood urea
nitrogen 27, creatinine 0.9, glucose 98.  CK was 70 with
troponin of less than 0.3

Chest CT was negative for pulmonary embolus.  Chest x-ray was
negative.  No acute process.

The patient had a cardiac catheterization [**2154-12-3**].  At that
time, the patient had 100% SVBG stenosis with severe left
ventricular dysfunction.  Echocardiogram in [**9-27**], showed 15
to 20% ejection fraction.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 57 year old female with severe
coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure admitted
for shortness of breath and chest pain.

Cardiovascular - Managed chest pain with Nitroglycerin,
Morphine, oxygen, Aspirin and Heparin, Continue current
medications.  Likely ischemic pathology.  Discussed for
cardiac catheterization with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] in the a.m.

Lungs - No crackles and not currently in left failure.  Will
continue to monitor.

Disposition - The patient has severe heart disease.  Consider
being placed on heart transplant list.  Will control pain and
consider cardiac catheterization for tomorrow, NPO overnight.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a heart catheterization
which showed a right dominant system with no disease in the
left anterior descending, left circumflex, left main or right
coronary artery.  The patient has a totally occluded old
saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending.  The
patient has severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  Left
ventriculogram was not performed due to high filling
pressures.  Cardiac index was 1.4.  The patient's pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure fell from 38 to 17 with 100
mcg/minute of intravenous Nitroglycerin.  The patient's
cardiac index rose to 1.8 during catheterization.  No
gradient was present across the aortic valve.
[**Hospital **] medical management and decreased afterload.

The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2163-3-12**], for
Milrinone therapy due to her congestive heart failure. The
patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed in the CCU to
evaluate her congestive heart failure during the Milrinone
therapy.  The patient was on Milrinone drip for approximately
two days.  The Milrinone was then titrated off.  Bisoprolol
was increased to 10 mg q.d. The patient's pressures just
prior to the Swan-Ganz catheter being taken out on [**2163-3-15**],
was PAP mean of 28, central venous pressure 8, SVR of 13/40,
cardiac index 2.25 with a cardiac output of 4.3.  The patient
diuresed well while in the CCU.  The patient refused to have
repeat Swan-Ganz for congestive heart failure follow-up. The
patient's Avapro was increased to 75 mg as well.  The
patient's blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.

The patient was transferred back to the regular floor out of
the unit in stable condition. The patient refusing cardiac
transplant but did consent to a cardiac transplant workup
which included an abdominal ultrasound which was normal with
no focal findings.

The patient also had carotid Doppler series which showed no
evidence of stenosis in either carotid arteries.  The patient
also had a duplex evaluation and ABIs which showed
ankle/brachial index as 1.04 which is within normal limits
bilaterally.  The patient also had PPD placed on discharge
which was negative.  PPD will be checked as well by VNA.

The patient did have an episode of hyponatremia while in the
hospital.  The patient's serum sodium decreased to
approximately 123.  This could be attributed the Lasix
diuretic, possibly a syndrome of inappropriate diuretic
hormone type picture.  Although the patient transiently for
two days had the low sodium, the patient's sodium on
discharge was 130 and trending upward.   The patient did not
have any symptoms of hyponatremia.

The patient's serum osmolality measured at 256.  The
patient's urine osmolality measured at 284.  Urine sodium
measured at 39.  Laboratories on discharge included sodium
130, normal white blood cell count, hematocrit 37.3.  Glucose
was within normal range at 82.

The patient's Heparin drip was stopped.  The patient was put
on Lovenox for outpatient bridge to a therapeutic INR.  The
patient's Coumadin level is 5 mg q.h.s.

The patient will follow-up with the congestive heart failure
clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] as well as appropriate endocrinology
workup for her hypothyroidism.  The patient's free T4 was
measured at 0.9, within normal limits.  The patient's random
cortisol level is pending.

The will also get physical therapy while at home and VNA
services to check her blood levels of sodium and her INR
which will be called into her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) 2031**].   The patient will continue her free water restricted
diet and follow-up with te congestive heart failure clinic.

The patient will also follow-up with psychiatrist as an
outpatient.  The patient was seen by psychiatry inpatient and
diagnosis of depression and started on Celexa 10 mg for seven
days and then increasing to 20 mg per day for depression.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient on discharge is
improved, ambulating we
