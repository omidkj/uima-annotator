Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Pacemaker Failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2121-7-10**] pacemaker lead removal/exchange

History of Present Illness:
81 [**Last Name (un) 9232**] with LV CHF (EF 30%) and 3rd degree heart block who was
called by pacemaker monitoring system after she was found to
have high impedence on RV and LV leads.  She said that she has
her pacer interrogated by tele monitoring every Wednesday and
that she had not been told she had any issues with it prior to
[**2121-7-8**].  She was seen in pacer clinic and the pacer was
reprogrammed with higher pacer outputs prior to being sent to
[**Hospital3 **].  She has been having nausea, vomiting and
lightheadedness for the last month, but otherwise denies any
chest pain, dizziness, SOB. Per visit to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2121-6-26**] was
having episodes of dizziness and flushing of unknown etiology.


She presented to [**Hospital6 **], her vitals were stable
with HR: 60, BP 165/53, T: 98.2, RR 17, 99% RA.  She went to the
cath lab for temporary pacer wire that was placed via left
femoral vein.  She is being paced by her intrinsic pacer with
the temporary wire as back up if needed.  Heart block with
Pacemaker years ago with Atrial and ventricular lead. Had lv
placed for CRRT and RV lead for ICD. RV ICD lead fractured. Has
4 left sided leads fractured. High pacing thresholds and alarms.
Had right femoral temp wire placed. Now needs to have lead
extraction and reimplantation on Thursday. Coming from [**Hospital3 **]
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was feeling well.  No
lightheadedness, dizziness, SOB, chest pain.

IMAGING:
CXR [**7-10**]: New pacer leads in the RA and RV. No pneumothorax or
effusion. NGT in the stomach with sideholes at the GE junction.

TTE [**2121-7-11**]: LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Mild
AS (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Physiologic MR (within
normal limits).

Conclusions  The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION
Ms. [**Known lastname 4887**] is a 81 year old woman with history of Systolic heart
failure and 3rd degree heart block who presented to [**Hospital3 **]
after pacer monitoring review found her to have high impedence
of RV and LV pacer now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for lead extraction.


# Pacemaker lead problems:  [**Name2 (NI) **] pacer settings were increased
(RV LOC increase to 2.4/1.0ms and LV LOC @ 6.0/1.0ms) and she
had temporary wire placed in her right groin at the OSH prior to
transfer.  She was noted to pace from her implanted pacer on
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and did not needed temp wire.  On [**7-10**] she went
to the OR for extraction of broken leads and replacement by new
leads for ICD/PPM.  This was accomplished but complicated by
massive blood loss (at least 1500 mL) requiring transfusion to 5
units pRBCs and 6 L lactated ringers.  When hemostasis was
finally acheieved, her hematocrit remained stable for the next
several days.  She did require vasopressors for
