CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Motor vehicle crash

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 44505**] is a 17-year-old
unrestrained driver of a car who hit a tree at approximately
70 miles per hour.  He was ejected from a vehicle and was
emergently transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  He was found to
have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale of 3.  At [**Hospital **] Hospital,
intravenous access was achieved and the patient was
intubated.  He received 4 liters of fluid and 2 units of
blood prior to this transfer to [**Hospital1 **] for
further emergent care.  He was accepted at [**Hospital1 **] as a trauma plus.  In the trauma bay at [**Hospital1 **], Mr. [**Known lastname 44505**] received bilateral chest tubes,
diagnostic peritoneal lavage which was negative, emergent
stapling of a bleeding forehead laceration and tightening of
pelvis.  He received 4 liters of crystalloid and 4 units of
blood.  Portable films were obtained in the trauma room and
from the trauma room the patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for further stabilization.

the last three years.

Electrolytes:  Sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 101,
bicarbonate 24, BUN 20, creatinine 0.4, glucose 122.  His
Tegretol level is 6.4 on discharge.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF INJURIES:  Mr. [**Known lastname 44505**] was initially
evaluated and was found to have the following injuries:

1.  Right temporal and frontal contusion.
2.  Small subdural overlying the occipital lobe.
3.  Left first and second rib fractures, right first and
second rib fractures.
4.  Bilateral scapular fractures.
5.  Large bilateral pulmonary contusions.
6.  Left clavicular fracture.
7.  C6 to T1 posterior process fracture.

10. Bilateral pneumothoraces, status post test tubes.
11. Multiple skull fractures and pneumocephalus.
12. Right zygomatic arch fracture, right maxillary sinus and
lateral [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the pterygoid bone fracture.
13. Mild diaphysis of the pelvis.
14. Pneumopericardium.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 44505**] was
brought to [**Hospital1 **] emergently after he was an
unrestrained driver in an accident with his car hitting a
tree at 70 miles per hour.  On arrival, he was intubated and
had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale of 3T.  He received aggressive
resuscitation and management over his hospital course which,
for the sake of understanding, is described below by systems.

Neurologic:  By history, prior to the accident, Mr.
[**Known lastname 44505**] is a 17-year-old young man with no neurological
deficits.  His GCS on arrival was 3 and his evaluation showed
that he had temporal and frontal contusions, subarachnoid
hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage and pneumocephalus.  He was
aggressively treated on arrival and received Mannitol,
Dilantin, PCO2 control, elevation of head and ICP drain
placement by neurosurgery and monitoring of cerebral venous
flow through a jugular catheter pointing toward the cephalad
region.  Despite this aggressive management, Mr. [**Known lastname 44505**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 44506**] continued to rise which can be attributed to his initial
injury.  This was confirmed by repeat CT scans.  Given this,
he received a pentobarbital coma which was continued for one
week.  During this coma, his ICP drain continued to drain and
[**Last Name (Titles) 44506**] consistently came down to a level of 16 or below.  After
this, the pentobarbital was withdrawn and he was allowed to
clear as much as he would.  Over the last two weeks of
admission after the pentobarbital was withdrawn, Mr.
[**Known lastname 44507**] neurological status has slightly improved.  He
has awakened from his coma to the level where he opens his
eyes and occasionally is tracking by his eyes.  He does not
follow commands and does not have any purposeful movement of
his extremities.  His pain medications and sedation have been
weaned to off and he is on Tegretol as he was prior to his
accident.  An MRI scan at discharge shows improvement from
his initial scans on arrival.  The recommended plan from a
neurosurgical perspective is to continue to monitor his
mental status for improvement.  He is to continue on Tegretol
with levels being monitored.  His last level at discharge is
6.4 which is therapeutic.  Of note, during his hospital
course, Mr. [**Known lastname 44505**] also received a four vessel angiogram
of his head to rule out a vascular injury.  He had normal
carotid and vertebral arteries during the study.  Finally, as
a rule out study, an EMG was obtained which was negative for
any neuropathy.  His ICP drainage catheter was removed 1.5
weeks prior to discharge and since then he has been stable.

Cardiovascular:  On hospital day 1 to 2 of his arrival, Mr.
[**Known lastname 44505**] was found to be slightly hypotensive, requiring
pressor support to maintain his blood pressure.  His
evaluation included a chest CT and chest x-ray, both
confirming pneumopericardium.  Suspecting that this
pneumopericardium may be causing a tamponade, an emergent
cardiac catheterization was obtained.  This cardiac
catheterization was consistent with tamponade and pericardial
drain was placed.  This pericardial drain was weaned and
taken off and follow up echocardiogram show an ejection
fraction of 55% with a normal ventricular function with mild
left ventricular hypertrophy.  Once he recovered from the
pneumopericardium, Mr. [**Known lastname 44505**] remained stable from a
cardiovascular perspective.  On discharge, he is not on any
cardiac medications.  Of note, during his hospital course, he
received intermittent hydralazine to treat occasional
hypertension.  This hypertension was attributed to episodes
of possible agitation during his awakening and at discharge
his blood pressure was stable and normal without any
medications.

Respiratory:  Mr. [**Known lastname 44505**] arrived in the trauma bay with
bilateral pulmonary contusions which were severe.  He
received emergent ches
