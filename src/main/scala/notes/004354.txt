Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90888**] is a 79[**Hospital **] transfer from OSH with a
nonverbal/noncommunicative baseline due to mental retardation
and schizophrenia who presented in respiratory distress.
.
At the OSH, he had a desaturation to 55% on RA.  He has an
active DNR/DNI, and was placed on noninvasives. He received
vancomycin and solumedrol for pneumonia versus COPD
exacerbation.  Per EMS en route, his oxygenation improved with
application of the BiPAP mask.  ABG there revealed 7.39/40/24 on
BIPAP 20/10.  Received solumedrol prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his initial vitals were pulse 92
BP108/76 RR24, sat 95%RA.  He was found to be nonverbal with an
examination revealing diffuse rhonchi throughout both lung
fields.  He was tachypneic but satting 95% on RA.  He had a
lactate of 3.4, leukopenia to 1.1.  A CXR revealed possible left
perihilar infiltrate raising concern for HCAP.  Levofloxacin and
metronidazole were added to his regimen and he was admitted to
the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the unit, his initial VS were: T94.5 axillary,
P76, BP93/58, Sat 95% 50% face tent. He could not provide
further history.  BiPAP was removed on admission with
maintenance of his sats in the mid 90s on face tent.  Thick
secretions were noted.

Past Medical History:
- schizophrenia
- mental retardation
- COPD
- CKD (unknown baseline)
- tardive dyskinesia
- hypothyroidism
- GERD


Social History:
lives in [**Hospital 2251**] nursing home


Family History:
Unknown

Physical Exam:
On admission:
Vitals: T94.5 axillary, P76, BP93/58, Sat 95% 50% face tent
General: grunting, grumbling, swearing
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MM dry
NECK: supple, cannot assess JVD due to positioning
LUNGS: auscultation procluded by vocalizations, but no wheezing.
 Wet cough.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema


Pertinent Results:
TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular function is not well visualized due to
suboptimal views. Left ventricular systolic function appears
grossly preserved with possible regional wall motion abnormality
(EF ?50?). There may be apical hypokinesis but regional wall
motion is not well seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
LENIs;
IMPRESSION:
1. No deep vein thrombosis is seen bilaterally from the common
femoral to the popliteal veins. Note is made that the patient
did not tolerate evaluation of calf veins.
2. Small left popliteal [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
.
CXR:
Evaluation is limited due to patient positioning. The lung
volumes are low.  There are left perihilar and right infrahilar
opacities consistent with aspiration pneumonia. There is no
pneumothorax amd no large pleural
effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90888**] is a 79yoM with a history of MR, schizophrenia,
transferred from OSH for respiratory distress, admitted to the
MICU for monitoring

1. HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA:  He presented with
desaturations at the OSH and arrived on BiPAP, which was rapidly
weaned to face tent upon admission to the MICU, where he
maintained his saturations in the mid to upper 90s.  A CXR
showed evidence of a left lingular pneumonia, and so he was
broadly covered empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, and
levofloxacin pending cultures.  Levofloxacin was stopped on
[**2111-11-11**] to avoid further QTC prolonging meds, and vancomycin was
dced on discharged given no growth x48h. The pt will be
continued on Cefepime 2g IV q12h to complete an 8day course
(last day [**11-18**]). On discharge his O2 sats were stable on RA.

2. SEPSIS:  He presented with borderline low blood pressures
with MAPS in the 50s, leukopenia, tachycardia, and tachypnea,
elevated lactate.  With suspected pneumonic and urinary
infectious source, sepsis was likely.  He was fluid
resuscitated, and broadly covered with antibiotics as above.  He
received stress dose hydrocortisone since he is on prednisone
5mg daily at baseline for COPD. His blood pressure remained
stably low.  His lactate downtrended. On day of discharge he
received hydrocortisone 50mg IV q8h, and will be discharged on
his home dose of prednisone 5mg daily.

3. ELEVATED TROPONIN:  His trop was elevated to 0.16 on
admission with a BNP>[**Numeric Identifier 2686**]. CK and MB fractions were negative.
EKG showed lateral TWI which were seen on previous EKGs.  A
demand ischemia seems possible from sustained tachycardia. Trops
were downtrending on serial assays.

4. ELEVATED BNP:  BNP was >[**Numeric Identifier 2686**] on admission without a history
of CHF.  Clinically, he appeared hypovolemic on admission exam,
so acute CHF was not suspected.  A limited echo revealed a
likely EF of 50% though no wall motion abnormality could be seen
or excluded.

5. HYPERNATREMIA:  He presented with a Na to 150 which
downtrended with fluid resuscitation.

6. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:  He has CKD with unclear baseline Cr,
though presented with [**Last Name (un) **] to cr 2.0.  Urine lytes showed sodium
avidity with FeNa 0.08%.  Creatinine improved with fluids.

7. SCHIZOPHRENIA:  He has been institutionalized since age 18,
and was continued on his outpatient anti-psychotic regimen
including risperidone, risperdal consta, olanzapine, and
valproic acid.  Restraints necessary for attempted violent
behavior.  He appeared at his mental status baseline per niece's
report.  He often refused meals and oral medications.

8. HYPOTHYROIDISM: continued levothyroxine

----
Transitional Issues:
- The patient should be continued on Cefepime 2g IV q12h until
[**11-18**] to complete an 8 day course.
- PICC line was placed for administration of IV abx. This should
be discontinued on completion of antibiotic course.
