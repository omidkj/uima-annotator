HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57 year old
woman with a history of viral myocarditis at age 11 as well
as a history of multiple abdominal surgeries including a
Billroth II procedure, partial vagotomy and partial
gastrectomy in [**2153**].  She had a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy
for poor gastric emptying in [**2156**].  In [**2160**] she had
transverse colon volvulus and had a hemicolectomy with an
ileosigmoid anastomosis.  In [**2161**] she had a procedure for
lysis of intra-abdominal adhesions and was admitted to the
Cardiac Medicine Service on [**10-7**] with chest pain.  The
patient also presented with eight days of nausea, vomiting
and weakness as well as decreased p.o. intake.  On
electrocardiogram at the time of admission she had marked ST
elevations of 5 cm in V3 through V6.  She was taken to the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on [**10-7**] which
revealed angiographically normal coronary arteries.  Her left
ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 35% of unknown
origin although the patient has a history of viral
myocarditis at age 11.  The patient had multiple
echocardiograms during her admission which showed an ejection
fraction of around 20 to 22% with severe global hypokinesis
and a normal left ventricular size, also 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation.  After this, the patient continued to have
nausea, vomiting and developed abdominal pain.  Then she
began to have peritoneal signs as well as coffee ground
emesis.  She had a computerized tomography scan of the
abdomen which showed free air as well as free fluid in the
abdominal cavity.  The patient was taken to Surgery on
[**10-9**].  At that time they noted a perforation of her
previous jejunojejunostomy secondary to an adhesive
obstruction.  Procedure performed was a small bowel resection
with reanastomosis of various parts of the small bowel as
well as adhesiolysis.  During the procedure, there were some
small bowel contents filled into the intra-abdominal cavity
and a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed.

Postoperatively the patient had a long course in the Surgery
Intensive Care Unit of approximately one month prior to being
transferred to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit on [**2164-11-9**].  The Surgery Intensive Care Unit course was notable
for worsening cardiomyopathy as well as a large fluid
requirement.  Then the patient began to develop ascites,
bilateral pleural effusions as well as congestive heart
failure.  She was diuresed.  They performed thoracentesis of
both the left and right pleural space, both which were
sterile without evidence of infection.  The patient completed
a course of Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl after the
operation.  The patient also has been followed throughout her
course by Infectious Disease as well as Cardiology.  The
patient had several courses of pneumonia.  She first
developed a pneumonia with Senna Trepomonas.  On [**10-18**],
her sputum culture revealed 2+ Senna Trepomonas which was
Levofloxacin sensitive as well as 2+ yeast.  She was treated
for two weeks with Levofloxacin.  After that she was
extubated, however, ended up being reintubated three days
later because of increasing secretions.  They did more sputum
cultures on [**10-22**] and then she grew out Senna
Trepomonas as well as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.  She was treated for two weeks with a two week course
of Vancomycin.  The patient also began to have some diarrhea.
They did multiple Clostridium difficile samplings.  On
[**10-23**], her Clostridium difficile toxin was positive and
she was treated with a course of Flagyl.  The patient was
again extubated after she seemed to be improving at the end
of [**Month (only) **].  However, after several days she again began to
fail and had to be reintubated on [**11-8**].  At that time
she was transferred to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit
Service.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on [**2164-10-8**], at the time of admission revealed the patient was
afebrile, pulse was 85, her blood pressure was 117/62, she
was sating 96% on room air.  Generally, she is cachectic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] and Surgical Intensive Care Unit

to our service the patient was afebrile.  She had a pulse of
79, blood pressure 100/56 sating 100% on a ventilator set
with pressure support of 18 and positive end-expiratory
pressure of 5, FIO2 40%.  Arterial blood gases at that time
on those settings was 7.49, 3.8, 156, 30.  Her labs at the

negative.  She had cultures done [**10-7**] times two,
[**10-17**] times three, [**10-18**] times two, [**10-20**]
times two and [**11-8**] times three.  Her sputum cultures

on [**10-23**], negative for Clostridium difficile times five
on all other testings.  Pleural fluid samples on [**10-19**]
had polys no organisms, on [**11-3**] had neither polys nor
organisms.  The patient was transferred to us with her main
issue being failure to wean from ventilator as well as
question of how to best manage her congestive heart failure
