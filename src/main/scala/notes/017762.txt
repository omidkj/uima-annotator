Abdomenal ultrasound  ([**4-17**]):
1. Normal appearance of the gallbladder and liver
2. Bilateral renal cysts.
3. Single septation and equivocal nodularity in a cyst arising
from the lower pole of the right kidney. No vascular flow seen,
but suggested MRI of the kidney suggested for more definitive
assessment.

Chest x-ray ([**5-4**])
When compared to the prior studies, there has been no
appreciable change. Tracheostomy is appropriately placed and
unchanged. There is again noted areas of confluent opacities
within the left lower and left upper lobes as well as within the
right perihilar and peripheral areas in the right lung. These
are all relatively stable and can be consistent with sequela of
ARDS or more chronic fibrotic changes as described on multiple
previous examinations.

ABG prior to discharge ([**4-10**]): 7.45/35/108

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2188-3-14**] after being evaluated in the
ED and having his knee aspirated.  Later that day, he was taken
to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for R knee I&D and liner
exchange without complication. Please see operative report for
details. Postoperatively the patient did well. The patient was
initially treated with a PCA followed by PO pain medications on
POD#1. Infectious disease was consulted.

The patient was started preoperatively on vancomycin and this
was continued until culture results returned. His cultures from
the ED joint aspiration and from the OR grew back pan sensitive
MSSA. ID recommended changing antibiotics to Nafcillin, which we
did. They were to start rifampin once LFTs normalized. A PICC
line was placed for long term antibiotics.

He was started on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the
morning of POD#1. The patient had two drains that were
maintained until POD 2. He was kept in a knee immobilizer for 2
days and then worked with physical therapy. The Foley catheter
was removed without incident. The surgical dressing was removed
on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean and dry
but with a 4x4 cm area of congested skin overlying the patella
and straddling the incision. This area eventually desquamated
and a beefy red dermal layer was seen below. Plastics was
consulted and we discussed whether a gastroc flap would be
appropriate, ultimately it was decided that we should treat the
wound conservatively and see where the line of demarcation would
be and if there was any viable tissue. Regranex was started to
help with skin growth. The patient returned to the OR on [**3-27**]
for a wound debridment and R knee manipulation under anesthesia.
After the procedure, the regranex was changed to [**Hospital1 **] bacitracin.
 During the procedure and through the following days, the wound
began to develop an eschar. As conservative treatment was
failing, plastics was reconsulted.  He was taken to the OR on
[**4-4**] with plastic surgery for a gastroc flap; he was sent to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] postop for a transient pressor requirement. He was weaned
from pressors within the first hour in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and was
transferred back to the floor by POD1.

His routine labs showed an elevated creatinine of 2.2.
Nephrology was consulted and it was felt that he had some ATN.
He was hydrated aggressively and creatinine trended back down to
normal.

Additionally he was found to have elevated LFTs with an elevated
Tbili. An ultrasound was done which showed a normal gallbladder
without evidence of obstruction. He did not have any abdominal
pain.

He was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after hypoxia on the floor.
