Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3063**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness/Fluid Overload

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
drainage of pericardial effusion
drainage of plerual effusion
pleacement and removal of temporary dialysis catheter
placement of tunneled dialysis catheter


History of Present Illness:
79M with PHX h/o A Fib on Coumadin, moderate to severe AI s/p
AVR [**2182-6-27**], reccently readmitted [**7-15**] for BRBPR likely [**1-17**]
anticoagulation and diverticulosis and was discharged [**7-23**] to
[**Hospital1 100**] Home, now readmitted for worsening weakness and fluid
overload. Patient states that since he was sent to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab,
he has gotten worse, not better. He can participate in the
physical therapy, but he is not able to walk with his walker as
well as before. His breathing is not much worse than baseline-
he mostly feels weak.

He was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] in office [**7-31**] who found the patient to
be in fluid overload and he is admitted for monitoring of his
fluid status in house with likely IV diuresis.

While in house previous admission, Aspirin was stoppd and
coumadin continued. Patient was also complaining of new stool
incontinence, was found to be c. diff positive per PCR and was
started on 2 weeks of metronidazole to be completed on [**2182-8-2**].
On the same admission patient had TTE's on [**7-19**] and [**7-22**] which
demonstarted moderate pericardial effusion without signs of
tamponade (likely [**1-17**] recent CT surgery). Admission was c/b
initially difficult to control Afib/RVR which was finally
controled with diltiazem CD 120 mg po daily and metoprolol
tartrate 75 mg po daily; also had fluid over load (known CHF
with LVEF 45%) which was treated with IV diureis. He was
discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**7-23**].
.

On arrival to the floor, patient is comfortable with no
complaints.
