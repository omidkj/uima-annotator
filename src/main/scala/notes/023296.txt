Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath with speaking

Endotracheal Intubation
Hemodialysis Line Placement
Arterial Line Placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77yo M with severe diastolic HF (EF 55-60%, mild
AS, 3+TR/2+MR) with massive ascites, AF on coumadin, CKD stage
[**4-3**], severe PVD with multiple bypasses & procedures,
polymicrobial left foot osteo (h/o MSSA), DM, who presents with
worsening fluid overload and needing diuresis, from home.
.
Pt was hospitalized in [**2111-12-1**] for osteomyelitis and underwent
a left toe amputation.  He was discharged to rehab for 8 weeks
of iv antibiotics, which he tolerated well.  He was discharged
on 80 mg of po lasix.  After coming home, his weight was 220 lbs
per his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] was able to climb one flight of stairs, speak
comfortably at rest, and sleep with one pillow.  In the past
month, pt noticed increasing weight, and abdominal girth.  Pt
attributes that to dietary intake as wife cooks deliciously.
His wife reports strict low salt diet, and ~16 oz juice daily.
Pt was followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].  Three weeks ago, his lasix was
switched to torsemide 60 mg qd.  He still continue to gain
weight.  He started going to [**Hospital 25046**] clinic last week for iv
diuresis (getting 80 mg iv).  Prior to coming to the hospital,
pt weighed 241 lbs at home, and 247 lbs here.  Yesterday, pt was
found to be shortness of breath at rest, with ambulation
capacity less than 10 yards, and could not complete one
sentence.  He denied chest pain in the past 6 weeks.  There was
no fever, chill, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  He does have dry
cough, and recently decreased appetite.  Pt called [**Hospital 25046**]
clinic yesterday, and was recommend to come directly to the
hospital rather than to the clinic today.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient's VS were 98.0, 118/75, 100,
20, 94%2L.

Imaging:
ECG [**2112-5-17**]: Probable atrial fibrillation with ventricular
premature beats. Conducted complexes have right superior axis.
Right bundle-branch block. There are probably inferior Q waves.
Consider inferior myocardial infarction. Since the previous
tracing of [**2112-1-12**] the axis is more right superior. Otherwise,
probably unchanged. Clinical correlation is suggested.  TRACING

[**2112-5-17**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing right lung opacity has slightly increased in
extent. In addition, there is blunting of the right costophrenic
sinus, potentially suggestive of a new small pleural effusion.
The findings would be consistent with a combination of pulmonary
edema and pneumonia. The lung volumes remain low. Unchanged
massive cardiomegaly and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
No left pleural effusion.
Change in the right humeral head could indicate chronic right
shoulder
subluxation.

[**2112-5-18**] Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response
with ventricular premature beats including couplets. Since the
previous tracing the ventricular premature beats are more
frequent and include couplets. Otherwise, no significant change
from previously noted abnormalities. TRACING #2

Echo [**2112-5-23**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. An eccentric, inferolaterally directed jet of moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. At least moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Marked right ventricular cavity dilation with severe
free wall dysfunction. Pulmonary artery hypertension. At least
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-1-14**], the findings are
similar.
