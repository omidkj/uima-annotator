History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] is a 52M with h/o dilated CM (EF 30-35% on [**2195-12-10**]),
crack cocaine abuse c/b crack/toxic pneumonitis, h/o MRSA PNA,
COPD, and Type I DM who presents with dyspnea on exertion over
the last 36 hours. He noticed his dyspnea yesterday when he
noticed he could not walk more than [**2-21**] of one block without
stopping to catch his breath. This morning he was dyspneic in
bed while supine after waking up. Going to a sitting position
improved his dysnea somewhat. He walked back and forth to the
bathroom and became extremely short of breath prompting him to
call an ambulance. He had epigastric discomfort last night but
declines chest pressure. He declines fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea. Declines night sweats.
.
Of note, he has had multiple admissions for SOB and chest
tightness in the setting of crack cocaine use and attributed to
crack pneumonitis, most recently [**Date range (1) 35039**]/12 and [**2196-2-29**] -
[**2196-3-5**]. During his last admission from [**Date range (1) 63678**], he was
treated for with solumedrol, oxygen, and lasix for presumed
toxic pneumonitis and systolic CHF exacerbation. He was in the
MICU but not intubated and then transferred to the medicine
floor during that admission. He was initially treated with
antibiotics in the MICU, but these were discontinued on the
floor as there was no evidence of infection.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 163/122 159 37 96% on NIPPV. H was
treated with ASA 300mg, nitro gtt, solumedrol 125mg iv once,
levofloxacin 750mg iv, ceftriaxone 1g iv, lasix 80mg iv. Stopped
Nitro gtt given bp 85/53 as of 0700.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient reported that his breathing
felt much better than it did when he arrived to the ED. TTE was
obtained which showed a decrease in LVEF to 20%. He was treated
agressively with steroids and lasix. His edema and shortness of
breath resolved within one day and he was subsequently
transferred to general medicine.

Imaging:

Echo [**3-9**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed secondary to moderate-severe
global hypokinesis. The basal-mid infero-lateral segments
contract best. Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 20 %. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a very small circumferential
pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.

CXR on admission ([**3-9**]):
IMPRESSION: Increased asymmetric predominantly basilar diffuse
airspace
opacifications likely represent acute non-cardiac edema vs
pulmonary toxicity from inhaled substance.
