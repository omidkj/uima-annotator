vanco but does not appear that she has gotten this yet. CXR with
bibasilar opacities concerning for pneumonia. Mild leukocytosis,
elevated glucoses, and mildly elevated lactate on labs.Triaged
to MICU for respiratory distress and tachypnea.

Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2200-3-31**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant increase in multifocal ground-glass opacity,
which could be due to a multifocal infection superimposed on
known interstitial lung disease (ILD), progression of alveolitis
related to ILD, or acute exacerbation of ILD. If the ground
glass is directly related to the ILD, it is not typical of UIP.
Differential diagnosis includes NSIP, LIP and chronic
hypersensitivity pneumonitis given the air trapping and
distribution.
2. Unchanged nodules since [**2199-3-26**], do not warrant further
followup.
3. Increase mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive.
4. Minimal aortic valve calcifications, of unknown hemodynamic
significance.
5. 10 mm soft tissue between the stomach and the liver, could be

gastrohepatic lymph node or stomach diverticulum.
6. Increase in bronchial wall thickening and moderate
airtrapping, related to small airway disease.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2200-3-31**]:
IMPRESSION: New bibasilar ill-defined opacities superimposed
upon chronic interstitial lung disease. Findings may represent
an acute infectious etiology, but an inflammatory process such
as acute exacerbation of the patient's underlying interstitial
lung disease is not excluded.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT [**2200-4-7**]:
IMPRESSION: No lower extremity DVT.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2200-4-11**]:
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study
obtained on [**2200-4-10**]. The tracheostomy tip is about 5.5 cm
above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is slight interval
increase in widespread parenchymal opacity that giving its rapid
change might represent some degree of superimposed pulmonary
edema. Two areas of lucencies in the mid left and mid lung zones
are again noted, unchanged. Small pleural effusion cannot be
excluded. The right PICC line tip is in mid SVC.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2200-4-13**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures,
hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears preserved. Bones and
soft tissues appear unremarkable. Please refer to dedicated CT
sinus study for evaluation of the sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST [**2200-4-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
Multifocal sinus disease with aerosolized secretions within the
frontal sinus and sphenoid sinuses as described above as well as
partial opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally. In
the appropriate clinical setting, this suggests underlying acute
sinusitis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2200-4-15**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is no
relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are in
unchanged position. Unchanged is the extent and severity of the
bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities. There is no evidence of
newly occurred pneumothorax or of pleural effusions.
