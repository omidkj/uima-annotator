Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunnelled catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year-old woman with history of ESRD (started
on HD ~ 1 month ago) who presented to an OSH on [**2134-12-15**] with
non-specific complaints including lethargy, malaise. She was
found to have R IJ hemodialysis cathether infection and new
onset atrial fibrillation. At OSH was given vancomycin 1g,
Narcan 0.2mg IV, hydralazine 25mg po x1, labetalol 20mg IV x1,
and ASA 162mg x1.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. In our
ED, patient was satting 90% RA. She was given metoprolol 100mg
po x1, ASA 325mg x1, plavix 75mg x1, lasix 20mg IVx1, lasix 80mg
IVx1, lopressor 5mg IV x1, lasix 40mg IV x1, nitro gtt,
clonazepam 2mg po x1, and labetalol 10mg IV x1. Renal was
consulted and recommended HD, but pt had troponin leak and
therefore requested HD in ICU setting. Cards was contact[**Name (NI) **] re:
elevated troponins (2.13, 2.18) - [**Hospital 24816**] medical management
until infection cleared.
.
In the MICU, patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamicin
was initiated. Patient ruled in for NSTEMI by enzymes, and was
started on heparin drip. Blood cultures eventually grew out
Nafcillin-sensitive Staph Aureus, and patient was transitioned
to IV Nafcillin on [**12-16**]. Atrial fibrillation resolved with fluid
removal, and fluid overload from renal failure was presumed to
be the etiology. Patient received an ECHO in the MICU which
revealed ef 70-80% no hypokinesis. With regards to HD access, a
Left IJ tunneled catheter was placed on [**12-17**], and was used for
dialysis on the same day without issue.
.
At time of transfer, patient was satting 99% on 3L O2. She was
without symptoms of chest discomfort, shortness of breath,
nausea, or vomiting, and per MICU resident, was feeling
significantly better compared to admission. She was first taken
to HD, and thereafter brought to the floor. On arrival to the
floor, patient reported some feelings of gas pressure in her
abdomen and some constipation, [**Last Name (un) **] no sob, cp, n, v,
palpitations, f or chills. She denies any current pain.

1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Stable changes associated with small vessel angiopathy.

echo: Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is  16-20 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral
valve. Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
76F ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL p/w line infection, line
replaced, now doing better
.
1. HD catheter infection/bacteremia: As above, given the
patient's need for HD and a current NStemi she was in the Micu
and was treated for her infection with vancomycin and
gentamicin. Her R IJ tunneled cath was removed on admission and
new line was placed.  Blood culture growing MSSA from [**2133-12-14**],
so based on this the patient was started on IV nafcillin.  Her
surveillance cultures were continually monitored and remained
negative.  Her TTE on admission lacked any vegetations and
therefore her infection was attributed to her catheter
infection. Upon discharge, she will be converted to cefazolin to
be given following dialysis sessions for the next 3 weeks.
.
2. Irregular rhythm: In the micu the patient was thought to be
in afib and was treated with heparin.  The ECG interpreted to be
afib initially, however, read by cardiology attending reveals
sinus tachy with frequent APBs.  Based on this it does not seem
the patient has afib, and her EKG on the floor did not reveal
atrial fibrillation.  So this issue was resolved prior to the
patient coming to the floor. By time of discharge, she was in
sinus rhythm with frequent atrial ectopy.
.
3. NSTEMI: The patient was found to have elevated troponins
(2.13, 2.18), and cardiology [**Hospital 24816**] medical management until
her infection cleared.  The patient's enzymes were followed and
continued to trend down.  She was on a heparin drip, asa,
statin, ace and BB.  Her BB was uptitrated for optimization. She
experienced no subsequent chest pain. She was admitted on high
dose statin however her LDL was 131 (higher than her goal of
<70).  As it was unclear whether she was taking this medication
at home, no additional lipid lowering medications were added.
Her LDL should be repeated in the next 2-3 months with goal <70.
.
3. HYPOXIA: The patient required oxygen in the MICU and was
attributed to fluid overload in the setting of missed HD and
clinical exam.  The patient was closely followed and as her
volume status improved.  As her volume status was corrected to
euvolemic with HD/UF sessions, her hypoxia resolved to her
baseline.
.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient was continued on HD as an inpatient
and had no active issues.  She was followed closely by the renal
team. New hemodialysis access was established as above.
.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was well-controlled on her
home regimen and was checked frequently.
.
6. Hypertension:
