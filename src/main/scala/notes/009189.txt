Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10488**]
Chief Complaint:
Black stools

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 year old male with h/o CAD, CVA, HTN, COPD, with
black/maroon stools x 6-7 days. He has had 2 black BMs today
with increased fatigue and some lightheadedness when moving from
a sitting to standing position. He first noticed these dark
bowel movements a few months ago, but they were intermittent and
would resolve on their own.  They start to increased in
frequency of the past 6-7 days, but did not result in any
increased stool output and he describes them currently as
intermittent.  He denies any recent use of NSAIDs and has been
taking his Coumadin normally, without changing any doses.  He
denies any hematemesis, BRBPR, chest tightness/discomfort during
these episodes.  He does acknowledge coughing up pink-tinged
sputum from time to time, but this has not worsened recently.
Over the past year, since his CVA, he has complained of chronic
pins/needles over his right side, which seem to have worsened
slightly during the last week or so.  When he arrived at
[**Location (un) 620**], his INR was measured at 5.6, for which he was given Vit
K 10mg PO x 1 and 2 units FFP. Hct reportedly measured at 31.
Patient has been taking his [**Location (un) **], coumadin, and plavix at home
and still has his biliary drain in place from the placement in
[**Month (only) 404**].  He has gotten a few colonoscopies at [**Location (un) 620**] in the
past 10 years, but does not remember the results.
.
Of note, during a hospitalization back in [**2144-3-26**], endoscopic
CABG was performed d/t worsening exertional chest pain. His
hospital course was c/b the need to return to the OR for
re-exploration of his chest for bleeding after increased chest
tube output was noted with a L sided pleural effusion and
increased O2 requirement.  1 week after discharge, the patient
re-presented in [**2144-4-25**] with his 1st bout of acute
cholecystitis.  Since he was deemed a poor surgical candidate,
PTC was placed and he completed a 10-day course of Cipro/Flagyl.
 However, this hospitalization was c/b an acute stroke wit head
CT and MRI showing acute infarctions in the left occipital lobe,

left thalamus, left cerebellar hemisphere and right superior
cerebellum with resulting right-sided deficits.  The etiology
was thought to be cardioembolic and he was started on lifelong
anticoagulation with coumadin.
.
He was most recently admitted on [**2144-12-30**] with right upper
quadrant pain, with management of acute cholecystitis once again
with placement of a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, resulting
in removal of purulent bile.  He was treated with augmentin for
2 weeks.  This was immediately proceeded by an ERCP in [**2144-6-25**]
with stent placement for suspected cholangitis.
.
In the ER, VS 99.8 81 111/72 16 100%. Hct dropped form 31 at OSH
to 23. Pt had a NG lavage with minimal coffee grounds. Protonix
gtt was started. RBCs x 2 units ordered. Noted to have ARF with
Cr 1.4 from baseline on 0.9 to 1.0. PIV 16 and 18 g. GI made
aware and plan to see patient in AM for likely EGD. At transfer,
VS were 97.5 65 121/64 24 95% on 4L.
.
In the ICU, he is comfortable, breathing well on 2-4L NC. He is
not usually on O2 at home. He has not had any bowel movements
since coming to the hospital yesterday.  He is feeling well with
some mild epigastric tenderness.

EKG ([**2145-2-6**]): Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Low amplitude P
waves with slight P-R interval prolongation of about 220
milliseconds. Borderline low
limb lead voltage. Slow R wave progression in leads V1-V2 which
is
non-diagnostic. Cannot exclude underlying anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2144-12-30**] no diagnostic change.

EGD ([**2145-2-10**]): Large hiatal hernia. Sloughing in the whole
esophagus compatible with ischemic injury to esophagus. Erythema
and granularity in the antrum compatible with antral gastritis.
Normal mucosa in the duodenum. Otherwise normal EGD to third
part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course
85M with hx of CAD, CVA, PTC x2 for recurrent cholecystitis and
ERCP for suspected cholangitis, now presenting with GI bleed.
.
# GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: Patient has had maroon/dark
stools and symptoms of orthostasis in setting of acute hemtocrit
drop. NG lavage was mildly positive + [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely a upper
GI source. Pt at risk due to [**First Name3 (LF) **], plavix and coumadin. INR was
supratheraputic at [**Location (un) 620**] and reversed with FFP and Vitamin K.
The patient received two units of packed red blood cells, and
his hematocrit responded appropriately. Over the course of the
next day, his hematocrit remained stable.
The patient was started on a PPI drip, but then changed to PPI
iv BID. The patient's triple anticoagulation of aspirin,
Coumadin, and Plavix was held, but metoprolol was
restarted once blood pressures were likely to remain stable. Pt
then underwent EGD on [**2145-2-10**] which revealed hiatal hernia,
antral gastritis, and ischemic damage to esophageal mucosa with
sloughing. GI thought that the latter represented a healing
process. He was then transitioned to po PPI and did fine
