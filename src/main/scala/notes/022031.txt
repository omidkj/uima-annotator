[**1-30**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. Since the previous tracing of [**2184-1-22**] atrial
fibrillation is a new rhythm. The rate is more rapid. There are
non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities which may be due in part,
to the more rapid rate.

[**1-30**] CXR: The right internal jugular central venous catheter
terminates in the proximal superior vena cava. There is no
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
normal and stable. There is increased prominence of the
pulmonary hila and outlining of the right major fissure
consistent with volume overload/mild congestive heart failure.
The lung fields again show right lower lobe airspace
consolidation consistent with pneumonia. There is no pleural
effusion.

[**2-2**] CXR: Previous right middle and lower lobe collapse have
nearly resolved. Moderate right pleural effusion and some
consolidation in the lower lobe persist. Lung volumes are
generally larger and there has been an improvement in
subsegmental atelectasis at the left base also. Upper lungs are
clear. Heart is top normal size. There is no pneumothorax. Tip
of the right jugular line projects over the mid SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation admitted
for PNA and severe sepsis.

1) Sepsis due to pneumonia: The patient was initially admitted
to the intensive care unit where he was volume resuscitated,
treated with ceftriaxone/levofloxacin, weaned off levephed, and
gradually titrated off oxygen.  He was initially on stress dose
steroids, which were subsequently discontinued when his cortisol
level returned elevated. He was transferred to the general floor
[**2184-2-3**]. At time of discharge he was 95% on room air, 93% with
ambulation. He was discharged to complete a 14 day course of
cefpodoxime/azithromycin.

2) Atrial fibrillation: The patient had multiple paroxysmal
episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR. The electrophysiology
service was consulted, and he was started on flecanide in
addition to the metoprolol. He was not anticoagulated, given his
history of falls. At time of discharge, he was in sinus rhythm
with good rate control. He was discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts
monitor to follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

3) Thrombocytopenia: Over the course of his hospital stay, his
platelets nadired at 82, subsequently rising to 132 on
discharge. A HIT antibody was negative and the patient was
without evidence of bleeding. His thrombocytopenia was most
likely related to sepsis-related bone marrow suppression; his
platelet count will need to be monitored as an outpatient.

4) Bipolar disorder: The patient was continued on Topamax,
zyprexa, and depakote.

5) Anemia: Per notes, the patient has received IV iron in the
past. Vitamin B12/folate were normal, and iron studies were
consistent with anemia of acute inflammation. At time of
discharge, his hematocrit was stable at 33. His hematocrit will
need to be closely monitored as an outpatient; outpatient
colonoscopy may be considered at the discretion of his PCP.
