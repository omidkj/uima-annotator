History of Present Illness:
70 yo M with CAD s/p CABG and PCI x 3 (EF 44%), DM, HTN who was
sent to MICU from ED for hypotension. He presented to the ED
from an outpatient pain clinic with hypotension with BP 70/40
(per pt: normal BP 120/80) while being seen in pain clinic. In
pain clinic, was not given any extra narcotics or treatment that
would have dropped his BP. Patient had recent admission from
[**Date range (1) 12052**] at [**Hospital6 **] for back pain, and sent home on
vicodin prn which the patient didn't take. Also had ARF thought
to be [**12-21**] NSAID use, and some confusion with normal neuro eval
and MRI/MRA. No documentation of patient's BP trend during this
hospitalization. Since that admission, patient noted 1 week h/o
lightheadedness, subjective fever, decreased PO intake, and
fatigue. Then had onset of 1 day of profuse watery diarrhea. He
is on 80mg PO lasix at home and has continued to take this. FS
at home in 130s. No sick contacts or recent travel.
.
Denies abdominal pain, chills, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting,
shortness of breath, wheezing, increased LE edema, chest pain
palpitations.  No confusion, numbness, tingling, difficulties
with speech or coordination. Other ROS negative.
.
In ED, initial vitals were 100.2 64 82/60 18 94. Mental status
was intact. He received 5L of fluids, and SBPs went up to 110s.
Also given levaquin 750mg IV x 1 for guiac positive stool, and

99% on 2L. Patient was admitted to ICU for further monitoring
given hypotension.

ECG on admission: NSR at 77, old Q wave and TWI in III. No

MICROBIOLOGY:

IMAGING:
[**2-19**] Chest x-ray:

INDICATION FOR STUDY: Evaluate for edema or infiltrate in
patient with
coronary artery disease, low ejection fraction and hypertension.


Comparison made with most recent prior study from [**2168-2-19**].
Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain unchanged in size and
appearance. Linear
atelectasis is present in the left lower lobe. The remaining
lungs are clear with no consolidation, no pneumothorax is noted.
Bony structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo M with CAD s/p CABG and PCI x 3 (EF 44%), DM, HTN admitted
to MICU for hypotension which resolved after fluid resuscitation
likely secondary to dehydration, and diarrhea.
.
#. Hypotension: Patient with hypotension in clinic and also on
admission to ED. He was fluid responsive to 5L in ED and his
hypotension resolved upon arrival in ICU.  He did not meet any
other SIRS criteria when admitted to the ICU: lactate normal
(1.8->1.4), afebrile, no leukocytosis, no tachycardia. He was
likely hypovolemic in the setting of a possible gastrointestinal
infection.  He had no evidence suggesting a cardiac etiology of
his hypotension as there was no evidence of ACS by EKG or
cardiac enzymes x3. He required no further fluids while in the
ICU and he maintained this MAP >65.  Blood cx, urine cx were
sent with no growth to date at time of discharge. AM cortisol
was checked and was low at 4.1 He underwent [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test with
1 hr post-[**Last Name (un) 104**] level of 20.5 (nl response).
.
#. Diarrhea: Likely viral gastroenteritis. Pt had no further
diarrhea while here, so no stool studies could be sent
.
#. Acute renal failure: Creatnine up to 1.7 from recent baseline
of 1.3 on adission.  This resolved to normal with IV fluid
hydration.  Of note, he was also recently admitted to an outside
hospital for acute renal failure for excess NSAID use.
Creatinine was 0.9 at time of discharge. On day of discharge pt
was restarted on his lasix but on [**11-20**] dose (40 mg a day).
Tekturna still on hold and can be resumed as outpatient.
.
# Guaiac positive stool:  Likely related to diarrhea above.  Hct
has been stable.  Patient has follow up with his
gastroenterologist in [**Month (only) 116**], and may need repeat colonoscopy (last
one 1 year ago per patient) and possible EGD.
.
#. Chronic systolic CHF/CAD: Patient with known CAD status post
CABG and PCI in past, with baseline EF of 44%. His EKG was
unchanged from his baseline. While he did have some chest pain
when put supine in the ED, the was not his anginal equivalent.
His enzymes were cycled and were negative.  He was continued on
his ASA, statin, and plavix. His carvedilol and lasix were held
given that he was hypotensive. On day of discharge his
carvedilol was resumed and lasix was resumed at 1/2 home dose
(40 mg a day). His Tekturna will be held until follow up with
his PCP (BP currently does not warrant initiation of it--SBP
110s prior to discharge).
.
#. Diabetes Mellitus II, controlled, no complications: He was
not hyperglycemic in setting of possible infection,  His oral
hypoglycemics were held and he was maintained on an ISS.  His
metformin was restarted upon normalization of his creatinine and
his glyburide was restared on discharge.
.
# Anemia: Hct 33 prior to discharge. Iron studies were checked
and were normal. As per above, has had guaiac positive stool.
.
#. HTN: As above, his BP meds were held given that he presented
with hypotension. Carvedilol resumed prior to discharged.
Resumed 1/2 dose home lasix (40 mg) prior to discharge. Tekturna
held until follow up with PCP.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on his crestor.
