Pertinent Results:
.
IMAGING:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2146-6-8**] 5:12 PM
1. No acute intracranial pathology including no intracranial
hemorrhage.
2. Well-defined relatively hyperdense extra-axial mass seen
within the frontal interhemispheric fissure measuring up to 18
mm in greatest dimension. The appearance of this mass is most
consistent with a meningioma. MRI is recommended for further
evaluation.
3. White matter changes consistent with small vessel
disease and multiple old lacunar infarcts.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2146-6-8**]  2:41:08 PM
Probable multifocal atrial tachycardia
Consider left ventricular hypertrophy
Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes
No previous tracing available for comparison
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2146-6-9**] 1:21 AM
Probable meningioma along the anterior falx.
There is a second small meningioma in the left posterior fossa
abutting the
sigmoid sinus.
Small vessel ischemic sequela. No acute infarction.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2146-6-9**]  8:26:22 AM
[**Month (only) 116**] be sinus tachycardia but consider also atrial tachycardia
Borderline left axis deviation - is nonspecific
Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes
Since previous tracing of the same date, ventricular response
more regular
.
[**6-11**] renal us:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Mild scarring of the
kidneys bilaterally, otherwise normal-appearing parenchyma
.
[**6-13**] abd film:
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable bowel gas pattern. No evidence of
ileus.
.
ct abd [**6-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No bowel obstruction.
2. No fluid collections or abscesses. A small amount of free
fluid is seen in the abdomen and pelvis.
3. Thickened loops of bowel as described above consistent with
the given history of colitis. Progression of wall thickening of
bowel loops is seen to involve the distal ileum as well.
4. Anasarca.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis as described
above.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] was a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with htn, seizure d/o, who
presented with speech difficulty/new bilateral hand tremors and
C. diff colitis.  In brief, he had a MICU stay for hematemesis
and ARF with rising WBC.  He abdomen continued to be distended
and he continued to have copious diarrhea. It was determined
that his C.diff infection was so severe he would require
colectomy but his family did not want to put the patient through
surgery.  After much discussion with the MICU attending Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], the family decided to make the patient DNR/DNI and keep
only minimal support with antibiotics.  Upon transfer to the
floor, the family, including his son the HCP, the patient's wife
and daughter in law, decided to pursue comfort measures only
around 10pm.  The antibiotics and IVF were discontinued. The
patient was maintained on morphine for pain control.  He expired
around 1AM.
.
His hospital course is described below by problem list.
.
# C diff:
Found positive at OSH, likely secondary to recent antibiotics
used for treating pneumonia. WBC count began to rise day after
admission, with low grade fevers, and increase abdominal
distension. Pt had a CT abd scan which showed thickened loops of
bowel consistent with the given history of colitis. Vancomycin
PO was added to flagyl as pt was not clinically improving after
couple of days on flagyl alone. Pt had decrease PO intake and
was encouraged to drink more fluids and was aggressively
hydrated. He was transferred to the ICU for hematemesis and ARF
and in the unit his white count continued to rise and he
continued to have signs of colitis.  He was treated with flagyl,
PO/PR vancomycin, cholestyramine and zosyn.  His studies lacked
signs of ileus, though he was noted to have distention and
trouble with tube feeds so he was kept NPO and followed by GI.
He had daily KUB to monitor for toxic megacolon.
.
# Hematemesis: New onset coffee-ground emesis with likely
aspiration of contents. NGT placed and suctioned ~1L dark brown
material. Pt hemodynamically stable, Hct 42.  Transferred to ICU
for monitoring.  He had his hematocrit checked frequently, was
given IVF and remained stable and never required blood products.
 GI followed the patient and an endoscopy was not done. He
remained NPO for aspiration risks.
.
# Aspiration pneumonia: New LL lobe infiltrate with likley
aspiration noted. Already on broad coverage with zosyn, but
concern that patient may be becoming septic with hypothermia and
increased wbc count, given this the patient was kept on zosyn
and vancomycin was added.  He was kept NPO as well.
.
# Dysarthria:
Unclear duration of speech difficulty per history. Possibly due
to underlying delirium secondary to new Cdiff infection.
Unlikely to be TIA or stroke given negative head imaging post
fall and no other focal neurological deficits, absence of signs
concerning neighboring brainstem dysfunction. Extra-axial mass
not in location to be contributing to speech difficulty as not
in Broca's area and no evidence of mass effect on brain
parenchyma region involved in facial, tongue motor function.
Cannot exclude toxic-metabolic etiologies given underlying
infection and renal failure.
.
# Intention tremor:
Also of unknown duration. Not on medications that would cause
tremors. No electrolye abnormalities. Calcium low but within
normal when corrected for albumin. He has family hx of essential
tremors and is currently on beta blocker for heart disease.
Thyroid panel was normal.
.
# Intracranial mass:
Found incidentally on head imaging upon admission. Most likely
meningioma based on CT and MRI. Neurosurgery eval pt on
admission and no intervention was recommended, with suggested
followup in 3 month with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] and a repeat MRI
head at that time.
.
# HTN: The patient was normotensive, though in the ICU his
beta-blocker was held given his hematemesis.
.
# Seizure d/o:
Does not seem to be cause of fall as it appears to be mechanical
with lack of post-ictal state and no loss of consciousness.
Continued on phenobarb and gapabentin, without epileptic
activity during hospital course.  Prior to transfer out of the
ICU his gabapentin was held given his renal failure.
.
# ARF:
Baseline Cr 1.2 and increased to 1.8 on day 2 of hospital
course. Most likely in the setting of infection and diarrhea. UA
negative for UTI. He was aggressively hydrated, but given his
diarrhea, his renal fa
