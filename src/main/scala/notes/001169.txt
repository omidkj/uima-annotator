Allergies:
Neosporin / Latex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, delta MS, incontinence


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement [**2169-6-21**]


History of Present Illness:
HPI obtained from wife due to change in pts mental status.  76
yo with poorly differentiated lung carcinoma (likely small cell)
on etoposide and carboplatin, recurrent sternal wound
osteo/infection requiring debridements and flaps, s/p CABG in
[**2166**], CAD s/p MI and CABG, DMII, HTN, COPD who presents after
being discharged from [**Hospital1 **] rehab yesterday with
fever. The pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**4-17**] and underwent
sternal wound debridement on [**2169-4-26**] with tx for MRSA infection.
 He was then sent to rehab on 6 weeks of Vancomycin and a Vac
dressing (recently d/c'd).  The pt went home [**6-15**] and was without
complaints until [**6-16**] when his wife took his temp and noted it to
be 105.  The wife gave him 2 tylenol at that time and noted him
to have "shaking chills". He then became incontinent of urine
and became "short" with her.  His wife notes that he becomes
confused every time he has a fever, and states he was admitted
in [**3-20**] with fever and confusion.  She also notes he was
intermittently febrile at rehab as well as 2 days prior to his
discharge.  He denied cough, SOB, ab pain, d/c, n/v to his wife
prior to admission.  The pt states that during other
febrile/delta MS episodes in the past, she has never seen him
this somnolent.
.
The pt was seen by thoracic surgery in the ED and it was felt
the pt has a chronic chest fistula.  He received Linezolid 600
mg IVx1, lopressor 50 mg po x1, ativan 1mg pox1, levoflox 500 mg
IVx1, and flagyl 500 mg IVx1.  CT of the chest showed no
drainable collections.
.
Of note, the pt started etoposide and carboplatin while at rehab
on [**2169-5-9**].  His first cycle was complicated by neutropenic
fever, although he was receiving neupogen daily. The pt
reportedly had insomnia and sundowning at OSH with a negative
head CT.


Past Medical History:
Onc Hx per OMR:
In [**1-16**] pt was in the doctor's office for routine checkup and
was noted to have hemoptysis at that time.  He therefore had a
chest x-ray that showed a right upper lobe mass which was
followed by a CAT scan that showed a 2.2 x 1.9 cm right upper
lobe nodule as well as a
7.5 x 4.4 x 6-cm soft tissue lesion in the anterior right chest
wall anterior to the right clavicle, also diffuse moderate
emphysema. This was followed by a PET scan on [**2169-3-2**], which
revealed an FDG-avid nodule in the right upper lobe with a
maximal SUV of 24.6 that measured 2.2 x 1.9 cm, also a right
hilar 9 mm lymph node with an SUV of 8.9 as well as increased
activity in the sternal area in the surgically created muscle
flap at the patient's sternal resection site.  He then underwent
mediastinoscopy on [**2169-3-6**] with bronchial washings, which
were negative, and also had an I&D and sternal debridement.  He
was presumed to have nonsmall cell lung cancer and went in for a
fiducial placement in the right upper lobe mass for CyberKnife.
At the same time they did an FNA of the nodule which was
consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma with features of
small cell.  Pt was started on etoposide and carboplatin in [**4-17**]
with last dose [**2169-6-1**].
--CAD - IMI in [**2165**], s/p CABGx4 in [**2166**], which was complicated
by
mediastinitis and sternal osteomyelitis and MRSA wound
infection.  sternal wound infection
requiring sternal debridement and omental flap
reconstruction. He subsequently developed multiple sinus
tracts emanating from osteo.He had a pec flap repair on [**5-16**].
--incisional hernia -- s/p repair and recurrence
--COPD/emphysema on home night time O2
--T2DM - controlled by meds and diet
--HTN
--hypercholesterolemia
--GERD
--anemia - monthly procrit
--hyperlipidemia
--prior right frontal lobe and left caudate infarct
--h/o confusion, fever, urinary incontinence on admission [**3-20**]

CT Chest [**2169-6-16**]:
FINDINGS: The soft tissue mass in the posterior segment of the
right upper lobe previously measuring 3.2 x 1.8 cm is almost
completely resolved, now 0.5 x 1 cm with a fiducial marker in
it. Right hilar adenopathy seen just below the first mass (I
2:23) has resolved.

A 1 x 0.8 cm right middle lobe nodule, 3:36, is new. A 1.3x1.3
cm LLL nodule with calcification within it is stable or even
smaller. Bilateral basal atelectasis, left greater than right,
is grossly stable. Prominent centrilobular emphysema involves
mostly the upper lobes.

The patient had CABG and sternectomy for osteomyelitis. The
omental flap contains new areas of induration adjacent to the
previous fluid collection in the sternotomy bed which is now a
large thick walled cavity with a far wider connection to the
surface, perhaps due to debridement. It still has a long extent
long contiguity with pericardium but there is no pericardial
effusion or other fluid collection in the mediastinum. The
presternal lymph nodes are stable.

Heterotopic bone formation around the sternal excision margins
is stable. Several, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes measuring
up to 1 x 2 cm, are stable. Some of the bilateral asbestos
pleural plaques are calcified. There is no pleural effusion.

The imaged portion of the abdomen does not reveal any pathology
within the liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas and adrenals.
Several large gallstones are stable, with no evidence of
cholecystitis.

IMPRESSION:

1. Almost complete resolution of right lung mass and hilar
adenopathy.

2. New right middle lobe nodule, could be tumor or infection.

3. Unchanged left lower lobe nodule and bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis.

4. Large, infecti
