Admission Date:  [**2175-3-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2175-4-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2123-6-19**]       Sex:  F

Service:  SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old
woman who had a past medical history significant for
diabetes, panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary adenoma
and [**Location (un) 3484**] disease with multiple abdominal wall hernias.
She arrived to the emergency room with abdominal tenderness
and there were complaints of constipation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As noted above, the past medical
history was significant for panhypopituitarism, insulin
dependent diabetes [**Location (un) **] and [**Location (un) 3484**] disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient had a hernia repair.

ALLERGIES:  The patient was allergic to penicillin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Keflex, even with the penicillin allergy.
Vicodin for right arm burning.
NPH insulin 30 units q.a.m. and 46 units h.s.
Prednisone 3 mg p.o. q.d.
Levoxyl 0.2 mg p.o. q.d.
Provera 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a
temperature of 98.9??????F and had a heart rate of 74, a
respiratory rate of 14 and a blood pressure of 114/61.  The
heart was a regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation.  The abdomen was obese with multiple abdominal
wall hernias apparent and an incarcerated and tender
abdominal wall hernia which was unable to be reduced.  She
had no peritoneal signs, but was locally tender.  The rectal
examination revealed normal tone and was heme negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for urgent
operation to reduce the incarcerated ventral hernia.  She
tolerated the procedure well without any complications.
However, in the postoperative recovery room, the patient was
noted to have respiratory difficulty when she was extubated.
Thus, she was reintubated and transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.

The patient's stay in the Intensive Care Unit was primarily
for respiratory issues.  The chest x-rays were noted to have
evidence of aspiration with questionable pneumonia.  The
patient remained intubated for airway protection.  She was
also maintained on intravenous steroids.  On postoperative
day #3, her ventilator began to wean to a CPAP mode.  As for
her pulmonary sputum cultures, they were noted to be a
mixture of mostly oropharyngeal flora without any overgrowth
of one organism.

On postoperative day #4, the patient was extubated.  Her
glucose remained well controlled on sliding scale regular
insulin.  On postoperative day #5, the patient was breathing
comfortably on just nasal cannula support.  She remained
afebrile with stable vital signs.  Her glucose was well
controlled with sliding scale regular insulin.  Her wound was
clean, dry and intact with moderate amounts of [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drain output.  However, she was considered to be stable for
transfer to the floor.

On the floor, aggressive chest physiotherapy and incentive
spirometry were emphasized.  The patient's nasogastric tube
was discontinued, as the patient had begun to show signs of
gastrointestinal peristalsis.  She was passing flatus and
moving her bowels.  Her Foley catheter was also discontinued.
She was slowly started on sips, which she tolerated well, and
her diet was advanced to clears and eventually a full diet,
which she tolerated well.

Once the patient was taking p.o., her Synthroid was changed
from intravenous back to a p.o. dose.  Her hydrocortisone was
continuously tapered to her home dose of prednisone 3 mg p.o.
q.d.  Her oxygen nasal cannula was also continuously weaned
until, by postoperative day #8, she was on room air and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was also noted to be
ambulating well.  Thus, on postoperative day #9, the patient
was considered stable to be discharged home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  She will also receive [**Hospital6 3429**] services to monitor her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain
output, as she would be going home with all three of them.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Prednisone 3 mg p.o. q.d.
Levoxyl 0.2 mg p.o. q.d.
Albuterol inhaler two puffs q.i.d.
Insulin per her home regimen, to be followed by her
endocrinologist.
Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. times seven days for as long as the
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains are in place.
Diflucan 150 mg p.o. times two after finishing her Keflex.
Silvadene cream to her right wrist, where she had suffered a
burn previously.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
