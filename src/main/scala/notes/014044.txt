LR, dilaudid 1 mg IV, Ativan 1 mg po, Cefeprime 2 mg IV,
Vancomycin 1 gram. Due to left neck and arm pain ultrasound was

Brief Hospital Course:
47 M with metastatic melanoma presenting with L neck pain, found
to have diffuse recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, likely
LMWH failure, also fever and elevated lactate. Initially
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], started on heparin drip, and transferred
to the OMED service for continued management.
.
# Recurrent venous thromboembolic disease: The patient had
thrombus formation in his Left Internal Jugular, Left
Subclavian, Right Common Femoral, and Left Internal Iliac veins.
The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolisms for
which he had been on Lovenox 90 mg [**Hospital1 **] (1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **]) for months.
He had a left upper extremity PICC line, which was pulled on
admission. His CT Head was negative for obvious brain
metastases, so he was started on a Heparin drip, then bridged to
Lovenox 120 mg [**Hospital1 **], as one study has shown that a 20-25%
increase in dose may prevent future recurrences in patients with
LMWH failure. He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
.
# Fever: Initially concerning for septic thrombophlebitis;
however, admission cultures were negative, and his fever curve
trended down as his pain from the clots improved. We initially
started him on Vancomycin, but this was discontinued on [**1-8**]
after cultures had been negative for 48 hours. His PICC catheter
tip was cultured and had no growth. We believe his fevers were
likely secondary to his clots and tumors. He was afebrile >24
hours prior to discharge.
-F/U pending cultures
.
# Leukocytosis: Chronic, and likely secondary to his underlying
malignancy. His white count remained relatively stable. He had
no localizing signs or symptoms of infection, and his culture
data was negative.
.
# Hyponatremia: Resolved with free water fluid restriction.
Urine lytes suggested SIADH.
.
# Metastatic melanoma: Unfortunately, his melanoma is
progressing based on recent scans. The patient was to start
compassionate Ipilimumab at the [**Hospital3 328**] when he was sent to
our Emergency Room for evaluation of his left neck pain. We
continued to control his pain and anxiety while in house. He
will follow up with his Primary Oncologist, and at the Farber to
hopefully begin Ipilimumab in the near future.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic. Fe studies reflect chronic inflam
