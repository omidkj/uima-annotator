Brief Hospital Course:
She presented to the Emergency Room on [**2154-5-7**] with a right foot
infection.  Her WBC was 12.8, and clinically her wound was
swollen with purulent drainage.  An aggressive bedside
debridement was performed, and cultures were taken that grew
mul;tiple organisms.  Xrays did not show gas, but vascular
calcifications were seen.  There was no cortical involvement
noted.  She was admitted to the podiatry service with IV
antibiotics, NPO status, and plans for OR debridement on
[**2154-5-8**].

On [**5-8**], the patient underwent a right hallux debridement.  The
base of the proximal phalanx was removed, and the patient
tolerated the procedure well.  She was transferred to the PACU
with vital signs stable.  The medicine department was consulted
for co-management of her creatinine/renal status.  The patient's
creatinine responded with IV fluids, although it appears that
her baseline may now be 1.3 instead of 0.8 (notes from PCP).  On
[**5-9**], she had NIVS that showed suboptimal blood flow (monophasic
DP, PT).  Vascular was consulted for revascularization options.
From [**Date range (1) 85670**], the patient remained on the floor with vital
signs stable.  Her dressing was changed daily with a wet to dry
dressing change. On [**5-12**] at midnight, the patient had bicarb/IVF
for diagnostic angiogram on [**5-13**].  Angio results indicated that
a fem-distal bypass would be necessary, for which the patient
agreed to on the morning of [**5-14**].

She had recurrent episodes of heart failure and nausea while
here.  Work up eventually revealed coronary disease and
significnat mitral regurgitation. She underwent mitral repair
and revascularization on [**5-25**], which was well tolerated.  She
extubated and tubes and lines were removed per protocol.

She transferred to the floor where she progressed and was reqady
for discharge. A stay at rehabilitation was deemed appropriate
for continued IV diuresis and Physical therapy.  The Left foot
first toe inferiorly and rtigh t great toe amputation site were
clean and being treated with wet to dry dressing and bactrim
orally was being given. She remained above her preoperative
weight and diuretics were continued.

Due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Coumadin was begun with a
target INR of [**12-25**].5. Followup appointments with Cardiac Surgery
were made and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will need to see her in three weeks.
