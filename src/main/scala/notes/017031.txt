Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo Chinese man who was recently diagnosed with a-fib, started
on coumadin, and is now presenting with increasing fatigue.
Echo on [**2150-2-9**] showed EF 50-55%, MVA 0.8, LA enlargement, 2+
AR, 2+ TR, and mitral valve c/w rheumatic deformity.  Cardiac
cath on [**2150-3-10**] showed normal coronaries.

Pt was taken to the OR [**2150-3-12**] for AVR (21mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]), MVR (29mm
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]), and Maze procedure.  For more detailed account, please
see operative report.  Post-op, he was transferred to the CSRU
where he was extubated and weaned off his vasopressors on POD 0.
 He was transferred to the floor on POD 1.  He was started on
coumadin on POD 2 both for a-fib and double mechanical valve.
On POD 2, his telemetry read either as a wandering atrial
pacemaker or some sort of heart block, which EP consult deemed
not necessary to treat.  He went into sinus shortly afterwards.
He was also noted to have a R upper extremity thrombophlebitis,
which promptly resolved with IV ancef.  The remainder of his
hospital stay consisted of INR monitoring.  This will be
followed by the PCP's office on discharge.
