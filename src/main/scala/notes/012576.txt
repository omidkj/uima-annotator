History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old schizophrenic female who was admitted to
[**Hospital1 **] with congestive heart failure of unknown etiology.
Noted to have significant left pleural effusion on chest x-ray
for which she underwent thoracentesis. She was concomitantly
started on empiric antibiotics for presumed community acquired
pneumonia. An echocardiogram showed an LVEF o f 20% with global
hypokinesis and moderate mitral regurgitation. Cardiac
catheterization on [**2159-10-30**] revealed severe three vessel coronary
artery disease with severe LV systolic dysfunction. Left
ventriculography showed at least moderate MR with an ejection
fraction of 25%. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with 95% stenosis in the LAD with proximal occlusions in
the circumflex and right coronary arteries. Based on the above
results, she was urgently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
surgical intervention.

Coronary artery disease, mitral regurgitation, congestive heart
failure, active smoker, chronic obstructive lung disease,
schizophrenia, osteoporosis, history of ETOH abuse, history of

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation. Workup was unremarkable and she was cleared for
surgery. She remained stable on medical therapy. The following
day, she underwent a mitral valve repair and coronary artery
bypass grafting by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1290**]. The operation was
uneventful. Postoperative transesophageal echocardiogram
demonstrated good mitral valve repair with no leak and improved
left ventricular ejection fraction with ejection fraction of
about 40%. She was taken to the CSRU on moderate inotropic
support. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. On postoperative day one, she experienced acute
respiratory distress secondary to aspiration and required
re-intubation. By postoperative day four, she was re-extubated
and successfully weaned from inotropic support. She otherwise
maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day five. Given her pulmonary status, she required
aggressive pulmonary toilet and diuresis. She was maintained on
MDI and nebulizer therapies in addition to steroids and
antibiotics. Over several days, medical therapy was optimized.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm without atrial or
ventricular arrhythmias. She tolerated low dose beta blockade.
She was noted on POD#9 to have an elevated white blood sell
count and was found to have a cellulitis in her left lower
extremity vein harvest site, which responded to levofloxacin.
By POD#14, her WBC had decreased to 13K, she was approaching her
preoperative weight with oxygen saturations of 95% on room air.
All surgical wounds were clean, dry and intact. she was cleared
for discharge to home.
