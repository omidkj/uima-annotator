COMPARISON: [**2187-6-15**]

INDICATION: Status post cardiovascular surgery. Evaluate
effusion.

Moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size with
increased focal
loculated component in the periphery of the left mid lung.
Patchy and linear
foci of atelectasis in the left perihilar and basilar regions
appear similar.
Minimal focus of discoid atelectasis is demonstrated at right
lung base.
Widened cardiomediastinal contours appear stable in the
post-operative period.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2187-6-9**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+]
TR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal transvalvular gradients. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-6-9**],
the small pericardial effusion has resolved. The right ventricle
is now better seen and appears to be mildly dilated and
hypokinetic.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to cardiac surgery. She was seen by dental and
teeth extractions were recommended. She was started on cipro for
a UTI. On [**6-7**] she underwent extraction of teeth #17 and #20. On
[**6-8**] she underwent AVR/cabg x4/RF Maze/stapling LAA. Transferred
to the CVICU in stable condition on epinephrine, phenylephrine,
and propofol drips. Levophed started and then weaned over the
next few days. Additional Left chest tube placed for pleural
effusion. Cardioverted for A fib on POD #3. Amiodarone loaded.
Gently diuresed toward her preop weight. Extubated on POD #5.
Beta blockade titrated and chest tubes and pacing wires removed
per protocol. PICC placed for access. Heparin and coumadin
started for anticoagulation. Transferred to the floor on POD #9.
C. Diff. + and flagyl started.
Ready for discarge to rehab on POD #12.
