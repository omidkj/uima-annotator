CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2133-7-29**] IMPRESSION:
1. Dilatation of the aortic root at 4.7 cm. No evidence of
aortic dissection, intramural hematoma or pulmonary embolism.
2. A small amount of fluid within the superior pericardial
recess consistent with a small pericardial effusio
3. Mild apical bullous emphysematous changes.
4. Small hiatal hernia.
5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
6. Small amount of intraabdominal ascites.

ECG [**2133-7-29**]: Sinus rhythm at upper limits of normal rate. P-R
interval prolongation. Left anterior fascicular block.
Intraventricular conduction delay of a left bundle-branch block
type. Since the previous tracing of [**2133-7-18**] the rate is somewhat
slower and the QRS complex is wider. Clinical correlation is
suggested

ECHO Study Date of [**2133-7-31**]   Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis.
5.Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2133-7-17**], no change.
Impression:No echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary embolus
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Death Summary (please see hospital chart for further details):

The pt was admitted w/ CP and SOB as above.  His admission ECG
was unchanged from prior. Cardiac enzymes were elevated, though
trending down.  The morning following admission the pt felt
severe chest pain.  Shortly thereafter he was found to be
bradycardic --> PEA cardiac arrest in the setting of
hyperkalemia.  He received ACLS treatment, including sodium
bicarbonate, and regained normal rhythm and a blood pressure
(estimated resuscitation time <5minutes, pulseless time <20
seconds).  He was taken to the cardiac cath lab, where both the
LAD and LCx stents were widely patent.  He was treated for
hyperkalemia, and a balloon pump was inserted for cardiogenic
shock.
Though the pt was weaned off the IABP, his subsequent hospital
course was complicated.  He was unable to be weaned off
mechanical ventilation (pt developed VAP) and had numerous other
complicating issues.  Because of his very poor prognosis, the
pt's family decided to make him care and comfort measures only
on [**2133-8-9**].  The pt died with his family by his side on [**2133-8-10**]
at 2100.
