History of Present Illness:
54 year old female with h/o COPD, CHF (EF 50%), PVD s/p grafting
and R AKA, ILD, DM, and recent Staph pneumonia requiring
transient intubation who presents from rehab to OSH, then sent
here with respiratory distress.
.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 63766**] with Staph
aureus pneumonia with associated MSSA bacteremia. Discharged
[**1-25**] to complete a 4 week course of ceftriaxone to continue
through [**2-12**]. Returned [**1-31**] and was started on vancomycin,
ceftriaxone and clindamycin on [**1-31**]. Changed to
Vancomycin/Clinda/Cefepime as well as oseltamivir for flu B on
[**2-2**] when decompensated. She was intubated from [**2-6**] to [**2-11**] for
respiratory distress. Cefepime and clinda were continued for 8
days and transitioned to cefazolin [**2-10**]. Pt had extensive workup
for other sources which was unrevealing. She had a negative TEE,
CTA of the right stump and no evidence of increased uptake on
WBC scan. She was discharged to rehab with PICC and completed
Cefazolin course through 3/31 per last ID note.
.
On [**3-13**], she developed tremor, myoclonus and lethargy at rehab.
Amitryptilin was held. CXR with consolidation. Pt was started on
IV Vanc, Cefepime and Flagyl.
.
On [**3-17**], she developed increased respiratory distress and her O2
sats were dropping to 80s. She received 40 IV Lasix, 2mg IV
morphine and was sent to OSH ED on NRB. At [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ABG was 7.39/53/49 (?on NRB). A CXR showed supposedly
signs of CHF. BNP was elevated >5000 and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, her VS were T32 (rectally), 84, 160/90, RR in 40s, O2
sats in low 90s on NRB. Exam notable for crackles 3/4th way up
b/l. Her temp came up to 35.1 on warming blanket. Given her
respiratory distress, she was intubated with Etom and Succ. Her
VS post-intubation were stable. It was felt that she also has a
COPD flare and received 125 IV solumedrol and combivent nebs. In
addition she was empirically covered with Vanc 1gm IV, Cefepime
1gm IV and Flagyl 500 IV(unclear if Cefepime and Flagyl given)
b/o hypothermia and slight WBC elevation. A R IJ was placed. CXR
showed CVL and ETT in good position. Pt was admitted to ICU for
further care.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was intubated, sedated on AC.

STUDIES:
EKG: SR at 67, normal axis, nonspecific ST changes
.
CXR in ED (prelim): AP view of the chest in semi-upright
position. There is an NG tube with the tip within the stomach.
Right-sided PICC with tip at the level of the mid SVC. Since
prior exam, there has been worsening the right-sided pleural
effusion and pulmonary edema. Persistent wedge-shaped opacity in
the left mid lung zone.
IMPRESSION: Worsening right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary
edema.
.
Previous studies:
CT chest w/o contrast [**2199-3-6**]:
1. Left upper lobe consolidation is minimally decreased compared
to [**2199-2-2**] and smaller than [**2199-1-16**]. While the
cavitation favors a necrotizing infectious etiology, the slow
change in appearance raises the possibility of organizing
pneumonia.
2. Improvement in pulmonary edema and anasarca.
3. Increase in size of moderate right pleural effusion and
decrease in small left pleural effusion.
4. Slight increase in mediastinal adenopathy.
.
CHEST AP [**2-12**]: Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
unchanged. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
Right-sided PICC tip is in the SVC. The left pulmonary opacities
are not significantly changed from prior exam. There continues
to be right lower lobe atelectasis. There are moderate bilateral
pleural effusions which accounting for differences in technique
are not significantly changed. Re-distribution of effusion along
the left lateral chest is likely positional in nature.
IMPRESSION: Accounting for differences in technique, the
bilateral pulmonary opacities and moderate pleural effusions are
not significantly changed.
.
TEE [**2199-2-6**]:
No 2D echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or abscess.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Depressed LV function.
.
TTE [**2199-2-4**]:
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-12-13**],
trace aortic regurgitation and low normal left venticular
systolic function are seen on the current study (c/w diffuse
process - toxin, metabolic, etc.). A PDA is not seen on review
of the prior study nor on the current study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: Ms. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 54 year old female with h/o
interstitial lung disease (COP), COPD, diastolic CHF (EF 50%),
PVD s/p grafting and R AKA, DM, and recent Staph pneumonia
requiring transient intubation who presented from rehab to an
OSH, then sent here with respiratory distress. She was initially
intubated, started on empiric antibiotics for possible PNA,
although cultures returned negative and these were stopped. She
was also felt to have an acute on chronic diastolic CHF
exacerbation, responding well to having her transudative pleural
effusion tapped and gentle diuresis as needed.  She was found to
have C diff colitis and is being treated with flagyl. She was
given tracheostomy and G-tube on [**3-28**].
.
# Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with known
COPD, RB-ILD, CHF exacerbation, recent necrotizing staph aureus
pneumonia with MSSA bacteremia. Given all cultures have remained
negative, this is unlikely to be infection and antibiotics were
stopped and BAL on [**3-23**] with no WBC. Given rapid
