Pertinent Results:
[**6-14**] Chest Xray: There is a left-sided AICD with lead tips in
the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is a feeding tube
whose tip and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction.
 Cardiomegaly which is stable.  There is atelectasis at the left
base.  There are no pneumothoraces.  There is mild prominence of
the pulmonary vascular markings without overt pulmonary edema.

[**6-14**] CT head
1.  Redemonstration of subarachnoid, subdural, and now
intraventricular
hematoma without significant interval change, or mass effect.
2.  Left CP angle mass extending into the middle cranial fossa,
most
consistent with meningioma.  This could be better evaluated with
MRI when
clinically appropriate.

[**6-14**] Abdominal xray:
NG within the stomach

[**6-16**] CT Head
1.  No change in the subarachnoid, subdural, and
intraventricular hemorrhage.  No new hemorrhage is appreciated.
2.  Enlargement of the bilateral frontal extra-axial spaces is
most consistent with developing hygromas.  There is no
significant mass effect from this change.
3.  Stable hypodensity in the right cerebellum is consistent
with an
infarction of indeterminate age.
4.  Stable left cerebellopontine angle meningioma

[**2172-6-16**] 10:57 PM
IMPRESSION: infrahilar atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary
edema or appreciable pleural effusion.  Severe cardiomegaly
including an apical ventricular aneurysm has not changed over
the past two days.

[**2172-6-18**] CXR
IMPRESSION:  Stable left infrahilar atelectasis without new
airspace opacity concerning for pneumonia.

[**2172-6-19**]: WRIST 3 VIEWS BILATERALLY
LEFT WRIST:  There are no signs for acute fractures or
dislocations.  There are some mild degenerative changes of the
first CMC joint.
RIGHT WRIST:  Subtle lucency involving the ulnar aspect of the
right distal radius which may represent a subtle non-displaced
fracture.  Please correlate with direct pain at this site.
There are mild degenerative changes of the first CMC and
triscaphe joints.

[**2172-6-21**]: CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST
Reason: Pre-PEG placement
IMPRESSION:
1.  Isodense 1.6-cm renal lesion.  This finding can be better
evaluated with ultrasound.
2.  Small/trace bilateral pleural effusions, slightly greater on
the right.

[**2172-6-24**] 11:35 AM  [**Last Name (un) **]-INTESTINAL TUBE PLACEMENT
IMPRESSION:  Successful repositioning of Dobbhoff tube into the
post-pyloric position.  The tube is ready to use.
