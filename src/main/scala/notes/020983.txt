History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 27235**] is a very nice 71 YO gentleman with history
of MI s/p 4V CABG complicated by stroke who comes with weakness
and lightheadedness. Three days ago he was brooming the snow and
after 10-15 minutes of activity he noted to be very weak,
fatigued and lightheaded. He stopped and sat down and after [**6-6**]
minutes symptoms resolved. Patient denies any chest pain, chest
dyscomfort, pressure, diaphoresis. However, there was mild
shortness of breath associated and mild blury vission.
Yesterday, patient was brushing the snow of the car and he noted
the same exact symptoms. This time he went down to his knees due
to weakness without hitting himself. It took him close to 5
minutes to be able to sit down. Symptoms resolved after [**11-11**]
minutes. He denies any leg swelling, PND, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope. His wife got concern and brought him to
the ER today. Upon arrival he had Temp 96.1 F, BP 119/57 mmHg,
HR 78 bpm, RR 16 X', SpO2 100%. Patient had EKG changes
including ST depression in V4-V6 (poor quality) with borderline
Troponin I of 0.08. He was given ASA and put on heparin gtt. He
got ASA at home. He was guaiac negative. Of note, patient
presented with shortness of breath without chest pain (per
patient) when he had his MI earlier this year.

CXR: There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. The mediastinal
contours are unchanged. The patient is status post sternotomy.
The lungs are over-inflated, likely representing COAD. There is
no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.
.
Cardiac Catheterization [**1-18**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
severe native three vessel disease. The LMCA was heavily
calcified  with
a distal 80% lesion. The LAD was heavily calcified with an
ostial 90%
lesion. There was proximal diffuse disease up to 50% lesion. The
vessel
was occluded mid-vessel after S1 and at D2. The grafted stump of
D2 was
occluded with faint filling of the distal vessel via left to
left
collaterals. The Lcx was heavily calcified. There was was a high
early
take-off atrial branch. The major grafted OM2 stump was
occluded. The
mid AV groove Lcx had a 60% lesion after OM2. The LPL 1 origin
had a 70%
stenosis. The distal AV groove Cx had a 40%  lesion after LPL 2.
There
was competative flow in the LPDA. There was TIMI 1 flow into
distal Lcx.
The RCA was non-dominant. The mid vessel had a total occlusion
with
reconstitution via vasa collaterals.
2. Resting limited hemodynamics revealed moderately left sided
filling
pressures with an LVEDP of 23 mmHg. There was normal systemic
arterial
pressure with central aortic pressure of 119/57 mmHg. On careful

pullback from left ventricle to aorta there was no transaortic
gradient.
3. Selective vein graft angiography revealed an ostial 50% and
proximal
95% lesion in the SVG-OM2 with TIMI 2 flow. The SVG-diagonal and
SVG-LPL
were occluded.
4. Aortography revealed no aortic regurgitation and no
additional grafts
were seen.
5. Left ventriculography was deferred.
6. Successful PTCA and placement of a 2.25x16mm Taxus Atom
drug-eluting
stent in the origin/proximal SVG-OM were performed.  Final
angiography
showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual
stenosis.
(See PTCA comments.)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate diastolic dysfunction
3. Stenosed SVG-OM2
4. Placement of a drug-eluting stent in the origin/proximal
SVG-OM.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**1-20**]:
1. Coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated heavy
calcification of the LMCA and LCx with a subtotal occlusion of
the
distal LMCA.
2. Graft angiography of the SVG-OM showed a patent stent and
normal
flow.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central aortic
pressure of
100/49 mmHg.
4. Unsuccessful attempt at PCI of the LMCA-LCX was performed.
(See PTCA
comments.)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Unsuccessful attempt at PCI of the LMCA was performed.
.
ECHO [**1-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal inferior hypokinesis and possible
inferolateral hypokinesis (views suboptimal). There is no left
