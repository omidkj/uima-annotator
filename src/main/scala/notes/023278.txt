[**2143-1-16**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast
is present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. There is a well-seated, well-functioning
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. There is no aortic
regurgitation or paravalvular leak. There is mean gradient of 7
mmHg across the aortic valve at a cardiac output of 3.9 L/min.
Biventricular function is unchanged. Mitral regurgitation is
unchanged. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.

[**2143-1-25**] Echocardiogram
Difficulties with esophageal intubation, requiring assistance
from anesthesia with laryngoscope. No esophageal complications
noted. Propofol 50mg was given prior to procedure.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque. Normal ascending aorta
tube graft. Normal aortic arch diameter. Mildly dilated
descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). No
masses or vegetations on aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was monitored by a nurse
in [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated
for the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information section). No TEE related complications. The patient
appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
with normal free wall contractility. The appearance of the
ascending aorta is consistent with a normal tube graft. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present and well seated. The
paravalvular space appearance is consistent with recent surgery.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
valve abscess is seen. There is no perivalvular leak. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis seen. Well-seated aortic
valve bioprosthesis.
