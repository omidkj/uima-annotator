Pertinent Results:
Cath [**2178-8-27**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed no angiographically significant
coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD and RCA had mild diffuse
disease throughout. The LCX had moderate diffuse disease
throughout. 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal systemic
arterial pressures (136/67). Left (LVEDP 23 mmHg, mean PCW 22
mmHg) and right sided filling pressures (mean RA 10mmHg, RVEDP
15 mmHg) were elevated. There was mild pulmonary hypertension
(mean PAP 32 mmHg). The calculated cardiac index was
1.9l/min/m2. Peak to peak aortic gradient was 76mmHg with a mean
gradient of 55 mmHg. Calculated aortic valve area was 0.4cm2,
indicating critical aortic stenosis. 3. Left ventriculography
was not performed due to the patient's chronic kidney impairment
(baseline Cr 1.2-1.6). FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. No angiographically
apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease. 2. Critical
aortic stenosis. 3. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction. 4. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.
5. Reduced cardiac index.
.
CXR [**2178-8-27**] IMPRESSION: 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
2. Mild cardiomegaly with suggestion of left atrial and
ventricular enlargement.
.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE [**2178-8-27**]: 80-99% proximal right ICA
stenosis.
.
ECHO [**2178-8-31**] PRE BYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. POST BYPASS: There is
preserved biventricular systolic function. There is a well
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
No aortic insufficiency is visualized. The remaining study is
unchanged from prebypass.
.
CXR [**2178-9-3**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. The introducing sheath has been removed from the right
internal
jugular vein. The size of the cardiac silhouette as well as the
blunting of the left costophrenic angle is unmodified. There is
no evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities suggestive
of pneumonia. Signs of
overhydration are not present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2178-8-27**] for a cardiac
catheterization in prepearation for an aortic valve replacement.
Her cardiac catheterization revealed critical aortic stenosis
and no significant coronary artery disease. The cardiac surgical
service was consulted and Ms. [**Known lastname **] was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed
which showed an asymptomatic 80-99% stenosis of her right
internal carotid artery. No intervention was planned at this
time however vascular follow-up will be needed. An opthalmology
consult was obtained for clearance for heparin given her history
of a retinal hemorrhage. No contraindication for cardiac surgery
or heparin was found on exam and Ms, [**Known lastname **] was cleared for
surgery. On [**2178-8-31**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room
where she underwent an aortic valve replacement using a 21mm
pericardial valve. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Within 24 hours, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically
intact and was extubated. She was transfused for postoperative
anemia. Beat blockade, aspirin and her pletal were resumed.
Later on postoperative day one, she was transferred to the step
down unit for further recovery. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. She was gently diuresed towards her preoperative
weight.

She continued to make steady progress and was discharged to
rehabilitation on post-operative day 6. She will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and her primary care physician as
an outpatient.
