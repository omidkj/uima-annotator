History of Present Illness:
This is a 86 yo male w/PMHx sx for atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, Parkinson's Disease, and OSA on home Bipap who was
admitted for LLL pna, on levo/flagyl, who was subsequently
'found down' on floor by roomate this afternoon. On housestaff
arrival, patient found to be hypoxic to 84%, increased to 94% on
NRB. Lungs w/ b/l rales so given 20 IV lasix for diuresis. Of
note the pt had been on NS 125 cc/hr since that morning. BP's
stable in 140's-150's. EKG checked and demonstrated no acute ST
changes. CXR performed as well. VBG done, demonstrated lactate
of 5.0. pH 7.38, CO2 25. Noted to have fever to 101.7.

He presented to the ED on [**4-22**] with weakness and productive
cough over 1 week with a component of pleuritic cp. Patient's
caregiver stated that he has had increased secretions over the
past week, as well as increased confusion and pulling off of his
BiPap mask. She also notes that this morning he was very
fatigued, and couldn't get out of bed for breakfast. He had no
fevers or chills at home. There were no other localizing signs,
symptoms, no dysuria or diarrhea. At baseline, he is able to
walk with assistance, and is alert and oriented x3. He is able
to eat and bath and groom himself.
In the ED his vitals were temp 101.9 88 162/97 16 96% RA. He was
found to have LLL infiltrate on CXR. Fever but no WBC. His
symptoms were felt c/w CAP. He was started on levaquin and
clinda and admitted to medicine.

Echocardiogram [**2183-4-24**]:
Prior study was on tape 2001E245 (incorrect on prior report).
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2178-9-23**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall
normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Moderate/severe MVP. Partial
mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) MR. Eccentric MR
jet.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Significant PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is a small pericardial effusion.

No definite vegetation seen (cannot exclude).

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**9-23**]/200, the
mitral valve appears similar. Mild aortic regurgitation is now
present.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Distress:
Thought to be due to both severe mitral regurgitation (new c/w
[**2178**]) and pneumonia.  The patient was quickly weaned from 4L
Nasal prongs to room air.  He was observed in the MICU for 48
hours.  The pt did have an elevated lactate on admission but
this quickly normalized after fluid resuscitation.  (Lactate
fell from 5.0 to 1.5)  BNP of 6075 on admission also suggested a
large component of left-sided heart failure due to volume
resuscitation and severe MR.

2. CHF:
No previous h/o CHF.  Echo on [**2183-4-24**] with new severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 22539**]l mitral leaflet.  Cardiology (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**]) was
consulted and felt that the patient should be managed medically
with afterload reduction and beta-blockers as tolerated by blood
pressure and heart rate.  The patient was bradycardic with SBP
in the 90s, so no beta-blocker or afterload reduction was used.
The patient was diuresed with IV lasix ~3 liters with marked
improvement in respiratory status.  With new onset CHF and ST
depressions on ECG, will need outpt stress. He was ruled out for
MI as an inpatient.

3. PNA:
New LLL infiltrate on admission CXR pa/lat. No WBC, but fever to
101.7, increased resp secretions. Initially on clinda/levaquin
then switched to levaquin monotherapy.  Will complete a 10-day
course of levofloxacin (note interaction with coumadin).  Blood
and sputum cultures without growth at the time of discharge.

#Delta MS:
Likely encephalopathy [**3-6**] infection on top of baseline
parkinsons. Head CT without acute abnormality.  At baseline he
is demented, at best A/O x 2, but has marked difficulty hearing
and is easily confused.

#. Parkinson's disease. Patient appears to be at his baseline
level of dementia.
-Continue Sinemet for now.

#. Obstructive sleep apnea.
-BIPAP at night ([**1-7**]). Provigil for daytime sleepiness,
initially held.

#. Atrial fibrillation.
well rate controlled without therapy.
-Continue coumadin anti-coagulation with goal INR [**3-7**].  Note
interaction of coumadin with levofloxacin.

#. Anemia. Anemia at baseline. Appears to be c/w iron deficiency
anemia (Fe 20, Ferritin wnl, TIBC elevated).  Started on ferrous
sulfate today. Will need outpatient colonoscopy.  Stools guaiac
(-).

#. FEN. diet with ground consistency per swallow consult recs
