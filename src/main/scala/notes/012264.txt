ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Infectious Disease.  The patient remained afebrile
throughout his stay.  Repeat blood and urine cultures were
negative.  As per the recommendation of the Infectious
Disease Team the Klebsiella found in the patient's urine was
felt to be a contaminant and was not likely thought to be a
cause of acute infection.  Beta streptococcus.  The patient
will be treated for an aspiration pneumonia with p.o.
Clindamycin and Levofloxacin for two to four weeks with a
final duration pending the approval of the Infectious Disease
service.

2.  Pulmonary.  The patient continued to undergo aggressive
chest physical therapy as much as possible and required face
mask oxygen.

3.  Endocrine.  The patient will be tapered slowly on
Prednisone.

CODE STATUS/DISPOSITION:  Extensive discussions were held
with the patient's family including Mr. [**Name (NI) **] brother,
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27335**].  Mr. [**Known lastname **] family reinstated
their desires for the patient to be "DNR/DNI including no
re-intubations, pressors, or transfers to the medical

hospitalized again for these problems.  [**Name (NI) **] will be given
p.r.n. Morphine for comfort.
