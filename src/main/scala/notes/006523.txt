Admission Date:  [**2122-5-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2122-5-22**]


Service:  Cardiac Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope, new onset, rapid atrial
fibrillation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 19276**] is an 81 year old man
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2116**],
hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular
disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2116**], pulmonary
fibrosis who was transferred from an outside hospital for
transesophageal echocardiogram cardioversion secondary to new
onset atrial fibrillation.  The patient initially presented
to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**5-16**] after a syncopal episode.  The
patient denied presyncopal symptoms, no prior history,
occurred a few minutes post micturition, positive loss of
consciousness, positive ................., no chest pain, no
shortness of breath, no palpitations, no dizziness, no
incontinence, no tremors and no postictal confusion.  The
patient woke up in a pool of blood, called for help at the
outside hospital and was noted to be in new atrial
fibrillation with RVR to the 150s.  He was given Diltiazem
and Lasix with good response.  Head computerized tomography
scan was negative for bleed.  He was started on intravenous
heparin and transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for transesophageal echocardiogram cardioversion.

The patient underwent cardioversion on the day of admission.
Transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated no clot,
cardioversion required 360 joules with resulting bradycardia
with bursts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  A ten minute
presentation to initial Cardiac Care Medicine Team the
patient felt great and was without complaints.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable, stable urinary hesitancy,
no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no lower extremity edema, no
orthopnea, some increased shortness of breath.  He is
minimally active at baseline.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cerebrovascular accident.  Coronary
artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2116**] with saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery, left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to ramus and saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
in [**2116**].  Chronic pulmonary fibrosis on 2 liters home oxygen.
Cholecystectomy.  Peripheral vascular disease.  Hypertension.
Ejection fraction 40 to 45% while in atrial fibrillation as
noted by echocardiogram.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day; Enteric
coated Aspirin; Prazosin 2 mg q. day; Vitamin E 400 IU
b.i.d.; Vitamin C 500 mg q. day; Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  None.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother died of myocardial infarction in his
70s, mom deceased of breast cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive heavy tobacco, quit in [**2081**],
occasional alcohol, no drugs.  Lives alone.  Never married.
Independent in activities of daily living.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, blood pressure 126/79,
heartrate 79, respiratory rate 20.  Oxygen 84% on 4 liters of
nasal cannula.  In general, frail elderly man, rather poor
historian, talkative, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat, bilateral periorbital ecchymosis with
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, bilateral cataracts, not
reactive, poor dentition, oropharynx clear.  Mucosal
membranes slightly dry.  Neck, supple, no jugulovenous
pressure. Lungs, diffuse dry crackles bilaterally.
Cardiovascular, regularly irregular, loud S2.  No murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Abdomen, soft, positive, mid epigastric
hernia reproducible and nontender, nondistended, normoactive
bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities, no edema,
warm feet bilaterally.  Positive venous stasis changes.

LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer from outside hospital,
hematocrit 36, platelets 189, INR 1.5, PTT 69.8, sodium 141,
potassium 3.7, chloride 97, bicarbonate 38, BUN 24,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 125, TSH 0.79, CPKs 94, troponin 0.2
to 0.8.  Chest x-ray, interstitial fibrosis with superimposed
congestive heart failure.  Electrocardiogram, atrial
fibrillation at 115, right bundle branch block old, normal
limb at axis, low voltage T wave inversions, V1 through V3,
no ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular - The patient was admitted
to the Cardiac Medicine Service after his cardioversion.  He
was loaded on Amiodarone with dose of 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Liver function test and thyroid function test at the time of
starting medications were normal.  The patient with known
interstitial lung disease and will need close follow up on
his pulmonary function as he is starting on this
anti-arrhythmic.  For his coronary artery disease, the
patient was started on a beta blocker with Metoprolol 25 mg
b.i.d. and Lisinopril 5 mg q. day as well as a daily Aspirin.
The patient was also started on anticoagulation including
heparin GGT and Coumadin 5 mg q. day.  The patient was
maintained on standing Lasix 20 mg q. day dose.  On the
second hospital day the patient began developing respiratory
distress on the floor with oxygen saturations in the mid 80s
on 4 liters and briefly required a nonrebreather mask to
maintain his oxygenation.  Given these findings as well as
his crackles on examination, he was diuresed with
approximately 140 mg intravenous Lasix.  The patient had poor
urine output and continued respiratory distress as well as
eventual progression to anuria on [**2122-5-21**].  The patient
was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for Swan-Ganz
catheter placement to evaluate his volume status to determine
if congestive heart failure was indeed the cause of his
hypoxia as well as answer to the question as to his anuric
renal failure, particularly if he may in fact be hypovolemic
with prerenal failure.  Swan-Ganz catheter was attempted
times two on [**5-21**], first in the right groin with inability
to pass the catheter secondary to venous blockage.  Later
attempts were made in the right internal jugular, however,
venous access could not be obtained.  The patient's volume
status was determined to be hypovolemic and the decision was
made to proceed with fluid resuscitation.  The patient
received approximately 1.5 to 2 liters of fluid and urine
output improved to approximately 40 cc q. hour.

Cardiovascular plan at the time of discharge includes
continuing him no Aspirin, addition of beta blocker if the
patient's blood pressure and pulmonary disease tolerates.
The patient's LDL was determined to be 74 and no statin
therapy was initiated.

Pump function, the patient was felt to be hypovolemic at the
time of discharge.  Plans were made to continue his home
Lasix dose of 20 mg p.o. q. day as well as lift his salt and
fluid restructions.  Initiation of the ACE inhibitor was
delayed given his acute renal failure.

Rhythm, the patient has maintained normal sinus rhythm since
the time of DC cardioversion.  He will receive Amiodarone 400
mg b.i.d. while hospitalized with decreased dose to 400 mg
p.o. q. day for three months followed by 200 mg q. day
thereafter.  The patient will need follow up pulmonary
function tests at the time of discharge as well as in six
weeks time to evaluate for any progression of his
interstitial lung disease.  He will also need follow up liver
function and thyroid function tests.

Anticoagultaion, the patient was continued on Coumadin,
decreased dose of 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. and his heparin drip was
discontinued once his INR was therapeutic.

Endocrine - The patient was noted to have elevated glucose
values while hospitalized.  He was started on a sliding scale
insulin regimen.  He will need confirmatory fasting glucose
levels as well as hemoglobin A1C evaluation.  He will need
continued outpatient follow up for his hyperglycemia.

Infectious disease - The patient diagnosed as a urinary tract
infection, started on a course of Levofloxacin on [**2122-5-21**], should plan to complete a full ten day course.

Renal - The patient with severe prerenal azotemia, diagnosed
by phenol, less than 1% as well as diuria of 5% which was
improving with fluids at the time of discharge from t
