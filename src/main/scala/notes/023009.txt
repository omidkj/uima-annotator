History of Present Illness:
86 F with PMH of HTN, dCHF, functional MS who presented to the
ED with respirtory distress and HTN.  Of note, she recently
presented with similar symptoms of hypertensive urgency c/b
pulmonary edema requiring a brief intubation from
[**Date range (3) 96701**].  Her home nifedipine was discontinued and she
was started on a BP regimen of carvedilol/ lasix/ lisinopril.
.
Since her discharge from the hospital, the patient reports that
she had been feeling well and was able to do her ADLs without
dyspnea.  However, per VNA vital sign monitoring, her BP was
"poorly controlled" and on Wednesday, her PCP increased her
lisinopril to 20mg daily and lasix to 40mg daily.  Although she
thinks that her weight had been stable, does admit to increased
lower extremity edema and orthopnea requiring her to sleep in an
upright recliner (also helps back pain).  Overall, she has been
compliant with her low salt diet but yesterday went to a
barmitzvah where she had lox, potatoe latkas, i.e. high sodium
content.
.

acutely short of breath and diaphoretic.  Denied any chest pain,
palpitations, dizziness, headache or other complaints.  +
Productive cough since onset of symptoms.  No fevers, chills, or
other systemic symptoms.

desated to 70s with RR in 40s. Pt was placed on BiPAP. EKG with
no acute changes with an old LBB and CXR with pulm edema. Pt was
given SLN 0.4mg x 1 and started on a nitro gtt, lasix 100mg x 1,
Morphine 4mg x 1, Levoflox IV, ordered for Cefepime x 1, and
Vancomycin x 1. Foley was placed and so far 250ml of UO. Vital
signs at transfer were improved to HR 96 BP 153/84 RR 28 O2 99%
on CPAP [**9-21**] 50% fio2, and 0.5 mcg/ml/hr nitro gtt.
.

TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
