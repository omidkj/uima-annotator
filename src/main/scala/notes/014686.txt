Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, shortness of breath, cough.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
HPI:  85 y/o lady with chronic CHF, atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, h/o thromboembolic CVA in [**2165**], presents with
worsening dyspnea, fever, and cough.  Patient has experienced
chronic cough for ? weeks worse in the last week.  Non
productive.  She has felt warm and occasionally cold during this
time period.  She has had substernal chest discomfort with
coughing.  She felt genaralized weakness and decided to go to
[**Hospital **] Hospital.  ? Headache per previous records.  She had
decreased appetite and did not eat much yesterday.  She denies
any abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, dysuria,
hematuria, blood in stool, orthopnea, PND, focal weakness or
numbness.  Recent fall 2 weeks ago without traumatic injuries.
She feels generally week.
.
She presented to [**Hospital **] hospital.  Her BNP was elevated there
and with complaints of dyspnea she was thought to have CHF
exacerbation and given furosemide 40 mg IV.  Her heart rate was
rapid at 120s afib there and she was started on dilt drip.  She
also had fever to 101, WBC 14 and bands 18% and was started on
Zosyn.  Given her headache CT head was attempted but due to
technical difficulties they weren't able to get it.  She was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED to obtain a head CT.
.
On arrival to ED here vitals were T 98 SBP 90-100s.  Heart rates
were in 70-80s and dilt was discontinued.  Respiratory rates
were 19-20s.  Oxygen saturation was in low 80s in room air, low
90s on 6L NC and 99 on 100% NRB.  She did not have any headache.
 Exam was significant for bilateral crackles, trace guaic
positive brown stool.
.
CXR was concerning for multifocal pneumonia and was given
cetriaxone 1 gm and levofloxacin 750 mg on top of the Zosyn from
OSH. Given the new findings, she was given 1L of NS and 2 gram
of calcium gluconate (to reverse dilt). Head CT did not show any
acute intracranial pathology.  Her potassium was repleted.

.
Blood culture ([**11-14**]): negative
Urine legionalla: negative
Rapid respiratory viral screen: negative
.
[**2178-11-14**] CXR:  Moderate cardiomegaly with a mildly unfolded
atherosclerotic thoracic aorta are unchanged. There are
multifocal areas of airspace opacities predominantly involving
the mid and lower lungs bilaterally, compatible with multifocal
pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures are grossly
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia.
.
[**2178-11-15**] CXR:  The heart is markedly enlarged. Aorta is somewhat
calcified and tortuous.  The lungs are hyperinflated consistent
with COPD. There are patchy perihilar opacities as well as mild
bibasilar atelectasis. The appearance of the chest has not
changed much since the prior study.
.
[**2178-11-14**] CT head:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  2. Left
sphenoid sinus air-fluid level may represent sinusitis in the
appropriate clinical context.
.
[**2178-11-16**] Video swallow study:  Multiple oral and pharyngeal
phase defects with associated penetration and aspiration,
partially reduced with chin tuck position. Please see the speech
and swallow note in the online medical record for further
details.

Brief Hospital Course:
An 85 year-old lady with chronic diastolic CHF, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, h/o thromboembolic CVA in [**2165**], now
presenting with worsening dyspnea, fever, and cough. She is
admitted to the ICU for oxygen requirement and hypotension.
.
FEVER/DYSPNEA
She presented with worsening cough, fever, leukocytosis, diffuse
crackles, and CXR consistent with multifocal pneumonia versus
aspiration pneumonitis.  Her BP dropped after presenting to the
ICU to 70s requiring IVF boluses, concerning for sepsis.  She
was bolused with normal saline and started on levofloxacin and
vancomycin for empiric broad spectrum coverage, given that she
had already received doses of Zosyn at OSH and ceftriaxone in
the ED.  Blood and sputum samples were sent for culture.
   Overnight there was significant clinical improvement.  She
was afebrile and had decreasing oxygen requirements to 4L to
maintain O2 sats in mid 90s.  Her blood pressure was stable and
white count was normal. She was transferred to the floors on
hospital day 1.  Her antibiotic regimen was narrowed to
levofloxacin for empiric treatment of CAP.  She remained stable
on this regimen, with no white count, no fevers, and a steady
improvement in symptoms.  At time of discharge, she will take
two more days of levofloxacin to complete a 7-day course.  She
is off of oxygen, with ambulatory O2 sats of 94-95%.  She is no
longer dyspneic.
   We believe that she may have had an aspiration event, causing
a pneumonitis.  This would account for her rather rapid
improvement in symptoms.  The other possibility, given CXR
findings of multifocal infiltrate, is that she has had an
atypical pneumonia, either bacterial or viral, in which case a
7-day course of levofloxacin should provide sufficient
antimicrobial coverage.  There was no positive culture data from
urine, blood, or sputum.
.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
This was evident on her chest x-rays and consistent with her
significant smoking history.  She had wheezes on exam and we
treated with standing and prn albuterol/ipratropium nebs.  She
is discharged with Combivent inhaler.
.
ANEMIA
Her hematocrit trended from 36.9 to 39 to 31.3, to 29.9.  We
believe this was a dilutional effect in the setting of
aggressive fluid rescusitation as all cell lines were
decreasing.  After hospital day 1, her hematocrit was stable in
the high twenties.
.
CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE
She had a TTE in [**2176-11-15**] that showed moderately
decreased left ventricular function with 3+ MR and 4+ TR.  On
exam during this admission she appeared euvolemic, with no lower
extremity pitting ede
