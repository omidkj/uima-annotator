History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2331**] is an 80 y.o. F s/p L total knee replacement on
[**2117-9-22**] and has been at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (NH) since [**2117-9-26**],
presented on [**2117-10-2**] with increasing shortness of breath. She
denied chest pain, but endorsed a cough productive of green
sputum. Denied fever at nursing home. She did endorse sick
contacts at her nursing home. Sleeps in hospital bed always and
HOB is elevated. Denied any swelling in legs, but did say she
got dypenic with talking. Could not say how long these symptoms
had been going on for. Per daughter, visited [**Name (NI) **] on [**2117-10-1**] and
said "oxygen was low". Pt started on Levofloxacin 500 mg daily
on day of admission due to infiltrates on [**2117-10-1**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] form. Noted O2 sat 79% then increased to 4 L NC with neb
treatment --> 90% O2, back to 71% and pt was placed on 8 L NRB.

.
In the ED, initial VS: T 97.8 HR 95 BP 129/62 RR 18 94% 10 L
NRB. Pt noted to desat to 73% but up to 100% on NRB in ED.
Spiked fever of 101.2 in ED. Labs, BCx x 2, UA and urine culture
were completed. EKG, portable CXR, and CT chest were performed
significant for stomach herniated into chest without
obstruction. The patient was given Levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1,
Furosemide 40 IV x 2 (725 cc UOP), Acetaminophen PR 650 mg x 1,
Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x 1, and Fentanyl 25 mg IV x 1 and morphine
4 mg IV x 1 for pain. Surgery consulted for hiatal hernia.
.
In the MICU, the patient was started on levofloxacin 750 mg IV
Q48H, cefepime 1 gm IV Q24H, and vancomycin 1 gm IV Q48H. On
[**10-3**], levofloxacin was discontinued, and Flagyl 500 mg PO Q8H
was started. The patient was initially on a non-rebreather but
was eventually weaned to nasal cannula O2.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient reported that her cough and
shortness of breath had improved. She denied chest pain or
dizziness/lightheadedness.

Reports:
.
[**2117-10-2**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Poor R wave
progression. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
.
[**2117-10-2**] CXR (portable AP): There is a large amount of abnormal
gas lucency projected over the mid left lung field extending to
the mediastinum, likely a large hiatal hernia. There is adjacent
atelectasis secondary to mass effect. The cardiac controur
appears mildly enlarged. The right lung and the left upper lobe
are well aerated without pneumothorax. No pleural effusion is
present. There is no free air seen underneath the right
hemidiaphragm.  Degenerative changes are noted in the underlying
spine. The right humeral head is inferiorly positioned relative
to the glenoid, possibly due to the presence of a an effusion.
IMPRESSION: Large hiatal hernia with associated atelectasis.
.
[**2117-10-3**] CXR (Portable AP): Stable cardiomegaly and large hiatal
hernia. Improved aeration at both lung bases, and apparent
slight decrease in small left pleural effusion.
.
[**2117-10-2**] CT Chest w/o constrast: 1. Large hiatal hernia
containing nearly the entire stomach, without evidence of
obstruction. There is adjacent atelectasis in bilateral lungs;
infection within these regions would be difficult to exclude. 2.
Cannot assess for pulmonary embolism as no IV contrast was
administered.
.
[**2117-10-5**] CTA Chest: The quality of vascular contrast allows to
exclude the presence of pulmonary embolism in the main and
central pulmonary arteries. In the more peripheral parts of the
pulmonary arterial tree, the presence of PE can neither be
confirmed nor excluded. Moderate enlargement of the main
pulmonary artery, unchanged to the previous
examination.  Moderate increase in size of the pre-existing
large diaphragmatic hernia.  Minimal increase of the
pre-existing left lower lobe consolidation with air
bronchograms. The enhancement pattern suggests atelectasis
rather than pneumonia. Unchanged aspect of the pre-existing left
lower lung parenchymal opacity. No indication of right heart
strain. No evidence of pleural effusion. No newly occurred focal
parenchymal opacities. IMPRESSION: No evidence of central
pulmonary embolism. Minimal increase of left lower lobe
consolidation that are suggestive of atelectasis rather than
pneumonia. Minimal increase in size of the pre-existing large
hiatal hernia. Unchanged aspect of the left lung consolidation.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities. No evidence of
changes in the abdomen or the skeleton.
.
[**2117-10-3**]: Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound: No
evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
.
[**2117-10-4**]: Echocardiogram, transthoracic: The left atrium is
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. There is
no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The t
