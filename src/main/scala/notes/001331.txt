Chief Complaint:
prothetic mitral regurgitation, rapid atrial fibrillation

History of Present Illness:
This 65 year old white male underwent tissue mitral valve
replacement here in [**2112**] for endocarditis after a bout with a
septic prosthetic knee. This was done via a right thoracotomy.
He did well until recently when heart failure symptoms
developed.  He was found to have significant mitral
regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction.  He was
scheduled for rooperation and was admitted now with rapid atrial
fibrillation and acute heart failure.

Pertinent Results:
[**2118-12-5**] Echocardiogram
Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%) with
inferior/infero-lateral akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. A bileaflet mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is
present. The transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
Mitral regurgitation is present (probably mild?) but cannot be
quantified. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission he was stabilized, diuresed and his heart
failure cleared.  His creatinine rose to 1.6 and stabilized.  On
[**11-25**] he was taken to the Operating Room where redo mitral valve
replacement was accomplished via a median sternotomy.  See
operative note for details.  He weaned from bypass on Milrinone,
Levophed and Propofol in stable condition.  His coagulopathy was
corrected and he was extubated the following morning.  The
Milrinone was turned off and Lisinopril begun. The Levophed was
also weaned off and his hemodynamics were good with PA pressures
in the low 50s and a cardiac index of greater than 2.5.

He remained well and invasive lines were removed, diuresis were
begun and he was mobilized.  Slow ventricular response to atrial
fibrillation led to ventricular pacing.  Anticoagulation was
started for the mechanical valve and fibrillation on POD 1 and
intravenous Heparin on POD 2.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] right pleural chest tube was unable to be removed
and the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**12-2**] for
removal of trapped chest tube and exploration of inferior pole
of sternotomy incision. The inferior pole of the incision was
opened and it was discovered that the tube had been caught on
the Vicryl midline fascial closure suture.  That suture was cut,
and the tube was pulled back from under the drapes.  The wound
was irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  A
small fluid collection at the inferior aspect of the wound
substernally was noted and the patient was started on
ciprofloxacin and vancomycin for a 7 day course empirically.
There were no positive cultures.

Electrophysiology was consulted due to conduction issues
perieoperatively.  Due to prolonged AV conduction, dilated
cardiomyopathy and prolonged QRS, it was determined that he
needed an ICD placed.  Coumadin was held and Heparin drip was
started.  On [**2118-12-5**] the INR was 1.8 and he was taken to the EP
lab for ICD implantation.  Lopreesor was titrated up for rate
control after ICD implantation.  Heparin and Coumadin were
resumed post procedure.

He progressed well and Heparin was discontinued once the INR
rose above 2.0.  His antibiotics were continued for a seven day
course.  Arrangements for Coumadin follow up at the [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital 197**] clinic were made, as this was his routine before this
surgery.  He was ambulatory, wounds were clean and healing well.
 Discharge medications and restrictions were discussed with him
prior to leaving the hospital. He was neurologically intact.  He
was discharged on 5mgm of Coumadin 12/4,5 and 6 to have an INR
checked on [**12-12**].
