CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old male with
a history of PE in [**2156**], obstructive sleep apnea and prostate
cancer, who presented with shortness of breath starting four
days prior to admission, but becoming acutely worse on the
morning of admission.  The patient went to his primary care
physician and was sent to the Emergency Department.  He had
no chest pain, no pleuritic chest pain, no new lower
extremity edema, although the patient does have chronic
stable lower extremity edema bilaterally.  The patient had
recently flown to [**Location (un) **] and returned five days ago.  No
fevers or chills were noted, no recent illnesses, no melena,
no hematochezia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. PE in [**2156**].  2. Status post
orthopedic surgery.  3. Obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP at
12 mm of water.  4. Hyperglycemia history without a diagnosis
of diabetes mellitus, last A1c 6.5 in [**2167**].  5. Obesity.  6.
Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy.  7. Ankle
fracture.  8. Glaucoma.  9. Hypertension.  10.
Diverticulosis.  11. Chronic lower extremity edema.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa give the patient a rash.

MEDICATIONS:  1. Aspirin.  2. Multivitamin.  3. Timolol.  4.
Hydrochlorothiazide started three days prior to admission.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is the Chief of Anesthesiology
at [**Hospital6 1708**].  He does not smoke, drinks
occasional alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of PE.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 97.2, blood pressure
135/93, pulse 85, respirations 16, saturating 98% on five
liters, 88% on room air.  General:  Obese male, mildly
tachypneic with nasal cannula on.  Alert and oriented x 3 in
no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  Extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclerae,
benign oropharynx.  Neck:  No lymphadenopathy, no jugular
venous distension appreciated.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, split S2, no
rubs, gallops or murmurs, no heave.  Abdomen:  Obese,
nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel sounds, no
organomegaly.  Extremities:  2+ pitting edema bilaterally and
equal.  Neurologic:  No focal neurologic deficits.  The
patient reports a rectal examination was done in the primary
care physician's office and was negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.5, 69% polys, 21%
lymphocytes, hematocrit 42.9, platelet count 203, MCV 87,
sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 93, bicarbonate 23, BUN
17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 141, INR 1.2.

Spiral CTA showed large left main pulmonary artery embolus
and large right pulmonary embolus slightly smaller than left;
both are in the main pulmonary arteries.

EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 90, question of right atrial
abnormality, otherwise normal axis, no S1, Q3, T3, no ST
changes, no old EKG for comparison.

Echocardiogram done in the Emergency Department showed an
ejection fraction of greater than 60% but increased pulmonary
artery pressures 48-56 mmHg.  He has a dilated right
ventricle with decreased right ventricular function, abnormal
septal motion consistent with right ventricular volume
overload and left apical sparing consistent with [**Last Name (un) **]
sign.  There was mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 57-year-old male with past PE
presenting with massive bilateral pulmonary emboli and
hemodynamically stable.  The echocardiogram does show signs
of right ventricular strain.

1. Pulmonary emboli:  Massive bilateral PEs with right
ventricular strain but hemodynamic stability.  The patient
was initially admitted to the intensive care unit after being
started on heparin in the Emergency Department.  He was
observed in the intensive care unit for two days without
adverse events.  He was then called out to the floor and
continued on his heparin GTT with Coumadin dosing.  He was
then switched from heparin to Lovenox in anticipation for
discharge.  He gradually was weaned from his nasal cannula
and the patient was saturating 98% on room air with
ambulation upon discharge.

Lower extremity duplex was performed to look for potential
source of his PE.  This examination showed a nonobstructive
left popliteal DVT.  Because the patient was hemodynamically
stable throughout his hospitalization and improving on
anticoagulation, he was not given thrombolysis treatment for
his massive PE.  His anticoagulation will be managed by his
primary care physician, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3306**], [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].D.

2. Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was hyperglycemic
throughout his hospital admission.  His fasting blood sugars
were repeatedly greater than 126 and he was diagnosed with
type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He was started on Glucophage 500
mg p.o. q.d.  A hemoglobin A1c level was drawn which was 7.8
consistent with his suspected diabetes mellitus.

3. Gout:  The patient had a flare of gout in his left great
toe, podagra.  He was treated with indomethacin 50 mg p.o.
t.i.d. with mild improvement upon discharge.

4. Obstructive sleep apnea:  The patient was continued on his
CPAP of 13 mm of water at night.

The patient was discharged home stable on room air with
Coumadin and Lovenox bridging.  He will follow up at the
office of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3306**] on Friday [**2170-5-25**] for an INR draw
and follow-up appointment.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Massive pulmonary embolism.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Gout.
4. Obstructive sleep apnea.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lovenox 120 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. until therapeutic INR
as instructed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3306**].
2. Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q.d. until appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3306**] and then doses according to her instructions.
3. Timolol eyedrops 0.25% b.i.d. bilaterally.
4. Latanoprost 0.005% drops bilateral eyes q.h.s.
5. Indomethacin 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. until gout relieved.
6. Glucophage 500 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Multivitamin one p.o. q.d.
