Chief Complaint:
bilateral subdural hematomas

evacuation of left subdural hematoma


History of Present Illness:
78M s/p fall while playing [**Doctor First Name 13792**] [**Doctor Last Name 13793**] [**7-9**], had known small

Per daughter, pt saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] then and has f/u scheduled for 2
days from now, but has had 5 falls in the last 72 hours.

He reports the falls are all due to his right leg giving out on
him, which is a new symptom since his [**7-9**] fall.  Most recent
fall prompted his daughter bring him in today.

Pertinent Results:
CT/MRI: Bilateral subdural hematomas are enlarged since the
[**2192-7-9**] examination, larger on the left. New hyperdense
components are compatible with recent hemorrhage. Mild left
suprasellar cistern effacement is unchanged.
Bilateral hemispheric sulcal effacement is slightly worse,
particularly on the left. The quadrageminal cistern remains
preserved. No tonsillar herniation.

Ct head [**7-25**] -Interval evacuation of the left chronic subdural
hemorrhage with pneumocephalus, small residual hypodense
subdural fluid and small hyperdense blood products. No
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

2.  Slightly increased mass effect due to right mixed-density
subdural
hemorrhage, which is minimally larger, now with 4-mm leftward
shift of
normally midline structures.

Pelvic x-ray [**7-25**] - No fracture.  If clinical concern for
fracture persists, MRI or
CT would be of utility.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-7-26**] 12:37 PM
FINDINGS:  There has been no significant interval change in the
size of the bilateral subdural hematomas when compared to the
most recent comparison from [**2192-7-25**].  There has been
interval decrease in the amount of pneumocephalus within the
left subdural space.  The degree ofmass effect from the right
subdural hemorrhage including a 4 mm leftward shift of midline
structures has not significantly changed from the prior study.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.  The basal cisterns are
preserved.  There is no evidence of acute vascular territorial
infarction.  The visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air
cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.

IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in the size or mass
effect from the bilateral subdural hematomas compared to the
most recent prior study.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-7-27**] 8:03 AM

IMPRESSION:  Slow interval growth of the right subdural hematoma
over the past 48 hours with increased leftward shift of midline
structures.

[**7-27**]: CT Head- IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval evacuation of right subdural hemorrhage with large
subdural
pneumocephalus, small residual hypodense subdural fluid and
small new
hyperdense blood products.
2.  Persistent 11 mm leftward shift of normally midline
structures.
Effacement of the right lateral and third ventricles, with
slight left lateral ventricle dilation, is probably stable but
could be minimally increased; evaluation is limited by
differences in positioning. Follow up is recommended.
3.  Essentially stable left subdural collection, except for
minimally
decreased pneumocephalus, allowing for positional differences.

[**7-29**] LENI's:No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the lower
extremities.

CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2192-7-31**]
Patient is known with bilateral subdural hematoma.  New
bibasilar small
pleural effusion with consolidation is highly concerning for
aspiration

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US [**2192-7-31**]
No deep vein thrombosis identified.  Occlusive thrombus seen in
the left cephalic vein at the level of the antecubital fossa.

[**2192-8-1**] CT head:
Status post removal of the right subdural drain with unchanged
mixed density subdural.  The left-sided subdural predominantly
hypodense
subdural, although appears slightly more prominent, could be due
to interval differences in slice selection and angulation.
Continued followup recommended as clinically appropriate.  Air
within the subdural space again identified.

[**2192-8-1**] Video Swallow:
Trace aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  Penetration

with honey-thick and nectar-thick liquid.  Delayed oral phase.
Vallecular
residue.

[**2192-8-1**] CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the
bilateral
pleural effusions and the subsequent areas of atelectasis are
unchanged on the right.  On the left, they have minimally
decreased.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with sternotomy
wires but unchanged, absence of overt pulmonary edema.

[**2192-8-2**] LENIS: prelim-no dvt in BLE

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Neurologic Surgery Service for
management of a subdural hematoma.  The patient was taken to the
OR on [**7-25**] and underwent an uncomplicated surgical evacuation.
The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and
was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  Please see
operative report for details. Post operatively pain was
controlled with intravenous medication with a transition to PO
pain meds once tolerating POs.  Post op head CT on [**7-25**] showed
interval evacuation of left SDH and slight increase in right
SDH.  On [**7-26**] a repeat CT head showed no significant interval
change in the size or mass effect of right SDH. He was
transferred to SDU in stable condition.

On [**7-27**], INR 1.5, drain total from day prior to this AM ~550cc.
The Head CT  was consistent with slow interval growth of the
right subdural hematoma over the past
48 hours with increased leftward shift of midline structures.
The patient underwent craniotomy for evacuation of right
hematoma after administration of FFp and Vitamin
