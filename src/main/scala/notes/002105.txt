TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricle is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality
seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2193-1-11**] (images reviewed),
image quality is worse.

CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. Opacities at the lung bases, right greater than left,
concerning for
aspiration pneumonia as seen on the recent chest x-ray.
2. No evidence of bowel obstruction. Persistent mild gaseous
distention of
the colon which tapers to normal caliber at the sigmoid colon.
3. Mild central intrahepatic biliary dilation and inflammatory
changes
surrounding the common bile duct, unchanged since [**2192-10-5**]. Again, this is likely related to sequela of chronic
cholangitis with no evidence of an active process.

RUQ U/S :
This is a very limited study due to overlying gas, showing mild
central common hepatic duct dilatation. The etiology for this is
not apparent and most of the common duct cannot be imaged
successfully. This could be further evaluated with MRCP or ERCP
if clinically appropriate.

ERCP [**7-5**]:
Impression: A plastic stent placed in the biliary duct was found
in the major papilla. The stent appeared occluded without
noticeable drainage - this was successfully removed.  Upon
removal, extensive sludge and debris extruded from the biliary
orifice. Three stones and debris ranging in size from 5 mm to 10
mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the common
bile duct. The CBD was dilated to 12 mm. Given recent MI and low
platelets, decision was made not to proceed with sphincterotomy.
 A 7cm by 10FR biliary stent was placed successfully. Good
drainage of bile was noted from the stent after placement.

Microbiology: [**Month/Year (2) **] cultures no growth to date at the time of
[**Month/Year (2) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
[**Age over 90 **]yo M PMHx CLL, recent SAH, a/w fever, vomitting, elevated
LFTs, thought to have infection of biliary source, course
complicated by NSTEMI.

Active Diagnoses:
# Fever: Patient was admitted with fever, rigors, labs
significant for transaminitis and elevated alk phos suggesting
billiary source; u/s abd demonstrated mild CBD dilatation, CT
abd demonstrated intrahepatic biliary dilation and inflammatory
changes surrounding the common bile duct, without significant
change from prior imaging performed at time of recent CBD
stenting.  Review of records demonstrated prior ERCP performed
[**9-/2193**] at which time biliary stent was placed w recommendation
for removal in 2 months, however this was never done. ERCP was
performed which showed sludge and debris from biliary orifice
upon removal of an occluded stent.  Stones were found to be
obstructing the CBD and there was biliary dilation. No
spincterotomy was performed in the setting of recent NSTEMI and
low platelets.  Patient remained afebrile on Unasyn, and was
transitioned to Augmentin on [**2193-7-6**]. He is being discharged
with a prescription for ten additional days of antibiotics.

# NSTEMI: Pt reported a brief episode of chest pain on admission
accompanied by non-specific ST depressions that resolved w/o
intervention, followed by troponins peaking at 1.17 before
trending downward. He was seen in consultation by cardiology who
felt this was an NSTEMI. Aspirin was started, along with a
beta-blocker. He remained chest pain free on the general
medicine service and in the ICU. He will need to be seen in
follow-up for a [**Date Range **] pressure check and consideration of
further risk stratification.

following. Neulasta and Epo held while patient hospitalized. He
was transfused 2u pRBC's and 1u platelets on [**2193-7-4**] in
anticipation of his ERCP. He developed a dry cough and 1-2L
oxygen requirement following his second unit of pRBC's, and was
given one dose of Lasix 5mg IV overnight and 20mg IV the morning
of [**2193-7-5**] with resolution of his respiratory symptoms. He will
resume his outpatient Neulasta and Epo
