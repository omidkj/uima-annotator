Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old woman with a history of severe COPD

NSCLC s/p LUL lobectomy [**2126**] s/p XRT, vent-dependence has s/p
tracheostomy since [**2130**],  status post Y-stent placement
secondary to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
tracheobronchomalacia in [**5-6**]. Y stent finally removed on [**7-6**]
due to recurrent migration of Y stent.
Patient has been at rehab where a tracheostomy was noticed to be
malfunctioning for the last days. Per nurse notes, on [**2-27**]
patient had a "respiratory arrest" and code blue was called.
Tracheostomy tube  changed to [**Last Name (un) 295**] # 7. Old trach looked
clogged with dry mucous. Patient respiratory status improved
overnight, however this am, her respiratory status deteriorated
with SpO2 of 83% on vent. Tracheostomy was suctioned ,found to
have a "resistance" and copious amount of blood. Patient
transferred  ED where per report there have been no new episodes
of bleeding but obvious fresh bloo in suction tube.
In ED ABGs 7.35/58/111/34 on A/C 450 cc of TV and RR of 14.

ROS is negative for fever , chills, cough, night sweats,
abdominal pain, chest pain , hematemesis or weight loss.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2132-5-28**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Aneurysmal interatrial septum.


LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic function.
[Intrinsic RV systolic function likely more depressed given the
severity of TR].

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR.  Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.


Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic root is moderately dilated
athe sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-5-28**],
the right
ventricle is now dilated.

.
V/Q scan [**2133-3-5**]: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol
in 6 views demonstrate decreased tracer activity within the
right upper lobe, medially, in a non-segmental distribution.
Small subsegmental ventilation abnormalities are also noted
within both lower lobes. Tracer activity is noted to pool within
the airway, around
the patient's tracheostomy tube. Perfusion images in the same 6
views show a matched perfusion defect within the right upper
lobe medially. Small subsegmental perfusion defects in both
lower lobes match the ventilation abnormalities. Chest x-ray
shows an opacity within the right upper lobe medially
corresponding to the matched ventilation and perfusion defect in
the right upper lobe. The triple matched defect in the right
upper lobe is indeterminant for pulmonary embolus. Otherwise,
there is no evidence for pulmonary embolus elsewhere in the
lungs.
IMPRESSION:
Triple matched defect in the right upper lobe medially which is
indeterminant for pulmonary embolus. Otherwise, there is no
evidence for pulmonary embolus elsewhere in the lungs.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 year old woman with respiratory failure, tracheomalacia,
CHF,
COPD on home o2 presenting from rehab with respiratory failure
and blood in trachesotomy for rigid bronchoscopy.
.
# Respiratory Failure: patient has underlying severe COPD, lung
resection, diastolic dysfunction. Most likely exacerbation of
respiratory failure secondary to upper airway obstruction due to
tracheostomy malfunctioning ?granulation tissue. Bronch showed
patent airways.  No signs on imaging or clinical exam to suspect
PNA or CHF exacerbation, however sputum growing pseudomonas and
GPC - unclear if these are contaminants or true pathogens.
Patient treated initially treated with zosyn, cipro, and vanc.
Sensitivities showed pan-sensitive Pseudomonas but Zosyn was
continued since it will cover both psuedomonas in sputum as well
as proteus and klebsiella in urine. Plan is to treat for 7 days
(day one [**3-4**]). She was continued on bronchodilators. She was
restarted on her regular dose of
