History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 70 y/o F with a hx of COPD with a trach not
currently being vented, who presented from a NF to
[**Location (un) 745**]-Wellesly Hopsital with hypoxia and respiratory
difficulty. She is well known to [**Location (un) 745**]-Wellesly with numerous
previous admissions. Pt was not responsive to oxygen there and
per report the patient is at high risk for aspiration, since
peanuts and other food was found in her bedsheets. She is unable
to provide an accurate history. The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital6 **] CXR was suspicious for aspiration PNA
,R>L. In addition there was blood-tinged sputum from her trach.
Patient was treated with Vancomycin and Imipenem, and
transeferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as no ICU beds were available. Of note
patient was noted to have a potassium of 6.0, and was given
insulin, D50, and 1 amp of HCO3.

Hospital [**2105-9-18**] after fevers and RML, RLL, and LLL PNA. There
was purelent material in the trach, and she was presumed to have
a recurrent PNA. She was treated at that time with Linezolid,
Aztreonam, and Tobramycin given her h/o PNA's with Proteus,
Psuedomonas, Serratia, and MRSA.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
70 year old nursing home resident with multiple medical problems
who presents with aspiration pneumonitis and UTI.
.
##  Aspiration pneumonitis:
Patient was found to have a large right-sided consolidation that
resolved quickly within a day.  Patient was satting 98-100%
trach on vent, then was taken off of the vent and continued to
sat >95% on 35% FiO2.  She required suctioning Q6H, and was only
short of breath upon suctioning.  She was maintained on
Imipenem/Cilastatin for an 8 day course (to be completed after
discharge) to cover for aspiration pneumonia.  Sputum culture
grew out minimal yeast and oropharyngeal flora, but no bacterial
pathogen.  She was placed on Vancomycin for 6 days to cover for
MRSA, but no MRSA grew from the sputum culture, and Vanco was
thus d/ced.  Patient was not severely sick on admission, and
gradually improved until discharge.  Vitals were stable at all
times.
.
Patient has a trach but is not vented, is not short of breath,
and eats and drinks at baseline.  She is known to aspirate, but
"would rather die" than not be able to take food and drink by
mouth.  She was maintained NPO until the day before discharge.
The patient is fully aware of the dangers of aspiration and
possible death, but she wishes to eat and drink by mouth.  The
types of food that are least prone to aspiration were discussed
with the patient as being safer foods for her.  Upon admission,
peanuts and potato chips were found in the patient's trach.
Code status was discussed with the patient because of likely
readmission to an ICU, and she would like to follow her nephew's
wishes, and her nephew wishes her to be full code.
.
##  CHF:
There was a component of pulmonary edema due to CHF.  Patient
was diuresed with a goal of -1 to -2 L per day, which was
achieved with Lasix 20 mg x1/day.
.
##  Subglottic stenosis:
Communication between Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 65054**] (pulm fellow, [**Hospital1 18**]) and
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 1196**].  Patient does not
wish to remove her trach at this time, and she would not like
intervention or stent in her trachea.
.
##  Paroxysmal AFIB:
Coumadin 4 QD (home regimen) had been held during admission, but
was restarted upon discharge.  Patient was in normal sinus
rhythm during admission.
.
##  Hyperkalemia:
Patient was hyperkalemic upon admission, and kayexylate was
administered 1x with decrease of K to 5.0.  Patient was
asymptomatic.  Patient was not hyperkalemic for the remainder of
admission, and EKG showed NSR without hyperkalemic morphology.
Cr was stable and wnl.  Etiology of hyperkalemia was not
established.
.
##  UTI:
Patient has a chronic foley catheter that was changed on
[**2105-11-16**].  UA showed 11,000 WBC, and urine culture was negative.
Patient was covered with Imipenem/Cilastatin.
.
##  DM2:
BG were well controlled on insulin sliding scale.
.
##  Pseudoseizures:
Patient has a history of pseudoseizures and has been maintained
on Dilantin.  She was not able to take PO meds during admission,
but was restarted on Dilantin on the day before discharge.  No
seizures were witnessed during admission.
.
##  Depression:
Patient was discharged on Seroquel per home regimen.
.
##  History of gallstone pancreatitis:
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed for RUQ pain, and
was found to be negative for cholelithiasis, with no gallbladder
wall thickness changes.  LFTs and pancreatic enzymes were wnl.
.
##  Chronic pain:
Patient has pain "all over" and in her right upper quadrant that
is intermittent.  She was on a fentanyl patch with good pain
control.
.
##  Access:
Patient has a mediport (placed on [**9-18**], clotted on [**9-24**]),
which now appears to be functioning.  Site of port was clean.
.
##  Code:  FULL per nephew.
