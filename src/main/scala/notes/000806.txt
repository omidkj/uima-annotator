History of Present Illness:
77-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, status post porcine mitral
valve replacement in [**2137**],
diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy who presents w/ ? of
altered mental status.  In [**2137**] patient had developed bacterial
endocarditis, having received a six week course of antibiotics
prior to mitral valve replacement.  For the patient two years,
the patient has noted an increased symptom burden from heart
failure, with worsened dyspnea on exersion, 4 pillow orthopnea,
lower extremity edema.  At present pt describes dyspnea with
minimal exertion (dressing himself, or toileting).  The patient
has had ongoing conversations with his outpatinet cardiologist
regarding the necessity of valve replacement.  Over the last
month the patient has an even more progression of his symptoms.
The patient was discharged from BIDNH 2 days prior to
presentation after a MVA [**3-3**] to a syncopal episode.  The patient
reports prior synocopal epsides while standing from sleep.  The
etiology of his LOC was attributed to hypotension in the setting
of increased BP meds in the setting of MS.  The patient was
discharged with plans for cardiology follow up to plan for valve
replacement.
.....On the morning of presentation, the patient was awakening
from sleep, and for the first 1-2 minutes he was confused,
thinking he was in [**Country 9819**].  The patients family reports
recurrent episodes of acute, short-duration confusion while
awakening for the last few months.  The patients family does not
feel that he is confused during day to day activities, but does
note that he is somnlanent throughout the day.  In review of
systoms, the patient endoreses an englarging abdomen over the
last 2-4 weeks.  He denies abdominal pain, blood in stool,
change in stool quality.  He has no history of liver disease.
.....With this ? of altered mental status, the patinet was
brought into the ED for further evaluation.  while there his BP
was 90/53, HR 70, 89% 2L, 97% on 3L.  He was given an aspirin,
and admitted for further manegment.

NCHCT: [**2159-6-2**]
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Slight prominence of the right MCA, most likely represents
slight tortuosity. However, a small aneurysm cannot be excluded.
.
CXR ([**2159-6-2**]):
IMPRESSION: Subtle reticulonodular pattern in the lower lobes
bilaterally. In the absence of a prior chest radiograph this
could represents an atypical pneumonia or chronic changes. If
clinical suspicion for infection is high consider chest CT.

TTE ([**2159-5-30**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The prosthetic mitral valve leaflets are
thickened. Motion of the prosthetic mitral valve leaflets/poppet
is abnormal. There is a question of flail leaflet motion There
is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 76 year old male with history of MVR ('[**37**]), DM,
CRI, w/ known severe mitral regurgitation who presents with ?
AMS, found to be in acute heart failure.
On initial exam, there was clear evidence of volume overload,
with Lower Extremity edema, hypoxia, pulmonary edema, and
abdominal ascietes.  No evidence of LV systolic dysfunction on
TTE.  Patient's complaints of fatigue and SOB/DOE were thought
to be due to mitral valvular dysfunction, and patinet was
considered for MVR.  CT surgery was consulted.  On the afteroon
of [**2159-6-4**], the patient was sent for cardiac catheterization for
pre-operative evaluation.  In the holding area the patient
became increasingly altered, hypotensive, and Short of breath.
Due to his worsened status, he was transferred to the CCU for
concern of sepis.  Broad spectrum antibiotics were started prior
to transfer, he was placed on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and
Meropenem.  His respiratory and mental status continued to
decline and he was intubated.  He became hypotensive and
required pressors.  The family was notified and the wife decided
to make no further interventions, he was DNR/DNI.  Pressors were
increased due to continued hypotension.  Blood cultures came
back positive for gram + cocci.  The patient went into cardiac
arrest and expired on the morning of [**2159-6-5**].
