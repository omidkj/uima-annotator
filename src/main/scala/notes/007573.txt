Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8388**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
58 y/o M cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, CAD s/p CABG
presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**2109-3-28**] for chest pain. Over the
past several months patient has been experiencing intermittent
chest pain which lasts for 1 hour and resolves without
intervention. At first patient states the chest pain started the
past several weeks, but then stated he experienced it prior to
his cardiac cath [**8-16**]. The pain is described as pressure,
burning and sharp at times - but predimonetely pressure. The
pain occurs at rest and with exertion. He feels stress worsens
the pain and nothing makes it better including nitro. He also
describes nocturnal cough, bad taste but no sensation of reflex.
Patient additionally describes shortness of breath worsening
over the past several months - worse with exertion. Patient
describes mild improvement lying flat.
.
During his stay at [**Hospital1 392**] work-up involved negative cardiac
enzymes. Cardiology was consulted who felt pain was not cardiac
in nature. Per discharge summary this is in light of a recent
cath at [**Hospital1 18**] - however the most recent is [**8-16**]. Patient's
work-up also included a negative chest CTA. Patient was
evaluated by pulmonary who recommended treatment for COPD
exacerbation. Over the course of the admission patient became
progressively hypoxic decreasing to the low 90s on RA and 80s
upon standing - bringing up the possibility of hepatopulmonary
syndrome. Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up.

** OLD IMAGING **
From OSH [**2109-3-29**]:
CTA: No PE. Mild emphysematous changes in upper lobe. Mild
bibasilar atelactasis.
.
ECHO [**2109-3-29**]: Dilated LV with normal systolic function. Moderate
MR. [**Name14 (STitle) 62727**] shunt bubble study performed with
opacification of the LV after the fourth or fifth beat.
LVEF=65%.
.
Recent ECHO [**2108-9-4**]: Bubble study revealed late contrast in the
left atrium c/w pulmonary arterial venous malformation (and
bubbles appeared to eminate from the pulmonary vein into the
left atrium (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **])). LVEF>55%. Extensive complex (>4mm)
nonmobile atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta to 37 cm
from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. A very small (~4mm) mobile echodense structure is
noted on the left ventricular outflow side of the non-coronary
cusp of the aortic valve consistent with probable Lambl's
excresence (clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) 62728**]) although a vegetation cannot be
definitively excluded (clinical correlation recommended). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Agitated saline contrast study revealed late
contrast in the left atrium consistent with pulmonary arterial
venous malformation. Extensive nonmobile complex atheroma in the
thoracic aorta. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2108-9-4**]:
1. Native LMCA and three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-PDA grafts.
3. Moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure.

EKG:
At [**Hospital1 392**]: Normal axis. HR 54. No ST elevation or depression.
.
On admission: Normal axis. HR 70. No ST elevation, depression,
TWI. No changes from prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 M h/o cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, CAD s/p CABG
presented to [**Hospital3 5365**] with chest pain and shortness of
breath. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
# Hepatopulmonary Syndrome: Patient with a clinical history
supportive of orthodeoxia and platypnea. and consistent with
hepatopulmonary syndrome. A TTE with bubble study at an OSH
bubble showed opacification of LV after 4th or 5th beat,
consistent with HPS. He also had an ECHO with bubble study done
at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2108-8-8**] that showed likely pulmonary arterial
malformation possibly consistent with hepatopulmonary syndrome.
Additional work-up was negative for PE, pneumonia, or evidence
of heart failure. The patient was placed on 2-4L of supplemental
oxygen to treat his shortness of breath with good effect.
Hepatology saw the patient in the MICU and recommended abdominal
ultrasound and right heart catheterization for Liver
Transplantation workup that were completed and detailed below.
He is scheduled to follow-up next week with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
.
# CAD: Patient is s/p NSTEMI and CABG in [**2103**] with a recent
clean cardiac catheterization in [**2108-8-8**]. Despite his
presentation of chest pain on [**3-28**], CE's were negative and EKG's
were without evidence of ischemia/pericarditis. After transfer
from the OSH, he became chest pain free and repeat cardiac
enzymes performed on transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] were also negative.
CTA ruled out PE or pneumonia. His description of burning and
nighttime cough were thought to be more consistent with GERD,
but they did not recur as an inpatient. He was continued on his
home Nadolol and ASA, but his statin was held due to his liver
disease.
.
# Respiratory Alkalosis: Evaluated by ABG on [**4-1**] & [**4-5**]. It was
thought to be multifactorial due to pain, liver disease
