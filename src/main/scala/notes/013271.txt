Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of COPD (on
home O2,) CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, AF on coumadin, vagal sinus
arrest s/p PPM who was transfered from an OSH after presenting
with shortness of breath. In [**2178-3-29**] the patient underwent
a closed reduction of a right hip dislocation, and her
hospitalization was complicated by a report of bilateral PNA and
COPD exacerbation. She was discharged on a course of antibiotics
and a prednisone taper. One week following discharge, the
patient had worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and
worsening lower extremity edema. She was initially treated for a
recurrent COPD exacerbation, but when cardiac markers cycled
back as positive, she was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2178-4-21**] for
cardiac catheterization.
.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed
diffuse obstructing LAD disease, and 4 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] were placed.
An echocardiogram after the event showed regional wall motion
abnormalities with an EF of 40%. The patient required ICU
admission following catheterization due to hypoxia. The etiology
of her respiratory failure was believed due to heart failure, as
well as a COPD exacerbation. With increased sputum production
and wheezing, the patient was treated with antibiotics and a
prednisone taper.
.
During the hospitalization she had a 20 second asystolic
episode,
likely secondary to vagal episode. Code blue was called but
patient quickly recovered blood pressure, heart rate and
respirations wihtout intervention. Review of tele appeared to
have sinus brady and slowing before 20sec pause then sinus
tachycardia with recovering of pulse. A PPM was placed.
.
The patient has done well in subsequent follow up. She may have
had a a recent hospitalization from God [**Hospital **] Medical Center
with a recent CHF exacerbation. Per report, she had complaints
of 2 days of shorntess of breath, with sudden worsening the day
of presentation. Notes say that her symptoms worse with laying
flat. The patient actived EMS, and on their arrival vitals of HR
132, BP 200/80, RR 24, 88% on unknown oxygen. She was described
as having pursed lips, audible wheezes, and respiratory
distress. She was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**] for futher
evaluation. While at [**Hospital3 3583**], her O2 sats were reported
at 100%. She became apneic and unrespponsive. After a difficult
intubation, she was successfully intubated, and transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1, HR 100 BP 110/57, 100% on
the vent. She was sedated with propofol, given levofloxacin and
vancomycin with a question of an infiltrate on LLL. The patient
was admitted to the MICU for further manegment.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2178-6-26**] 3:37 AM:  Bibasilar
opacities improved, likely due to resolving edema, less likely
pneumonia given rapid change. No other change.

[**2178-6-29**] Stress Echo:
No anginal symptoms with borderline ischemic ST segment changes.
Slow junctional tachycardia noted toward peak exercise with
sinus rhythm noted thereafter. Appropriate heart rate and blood
pressure response to the Dobutamine infusion. Echo report sent
separately.

The patient received intravenous dobutamine beginning at 15
mcg/kg/min, increasing to 30mcg/kg/min and 45 mcg/kg/min in 3
minute stages plus 0.25 mg atropine. The test was stopped
because the target heart rate was achieved. In response to
stress, the ECG showed borderline ischemic ST changes (see
exercise report for details). There were normal blood pressure
and heart rate responses to stress.
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 64 bpm and a
blood pressure of 112/60 mmHg. These demonstrated regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
inferior wall. The remaining segments are contract well. Right
ventricular free wall motion is normal. Doppler demonstrated no
aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral
regurgitation or resting LVOT gradient. At mid-dose dobutamine
[15 mcg/kg/min; heart rate 63 bpm, blood pressure 148/96 mmHg),
there was appropriate augmentation of all left ventricular
segments. At peak dobutamine stress [45 mcg/kg/min and 0.25 mg
atropine; heart rate 114 bpm, blood pressure 154/60 mmHg), no
new regional wall motion abnormalities were identified. Baseline
abnormalities persist.

IMPRESSION: Borderline ECG changes with 2D echocardiographic
evidence of prior myocardial infarction without inducible
ischemia to achieved workload.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old female with a history of COPD, CAD s/p recent
NSTEMI, AF on coumadin, vagal sinus arrest s/p PPM who was
transfered from an OSH after presenting with shortness of breath
s/p MICU stay and intubation, likely due to pulmonary edema with
CHF as a result of her existing CHF with a possibly occult
ischemic event.  The patient had a stress echo done which
demonstrated no new ischemia, but the patient was sent home with
close instructions to follow up with her primary care provider.


# Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient was also thought to
have suffered from flash pulmonary edema from her chronic
systolic heart failure.  Though her CXR looked clear, the
patient responded to 180mg IV Lasix in the ED, and then was
continued on lasix while on the floor.  She continued to have
good urine output on her home regimen of lasix.  While in the
hospital she also had her carvedliol continued.  Unclear as to
the inciting event, possibly an occult ischemic event which was
not able to be seen via cardiac enzymes, which were negative.
The patient did have some new lateral ST-depressions on EKG.
The patient had a dobutamine stress test which showed no new
ischemia, but evidence of prior MI.

# COPD: The patient was initially treated with IV solumedrol in
the MICU and started on Levofloxacin for a presumed COPD
exacerbation with a possible PNA trigger.  It was likely that at
the outside hosptial, the patient was given too much oxygen and
had consequent CO2 retention, a decreased breathing drive, and
subsequent O2 desaturation.  The patient was extu
