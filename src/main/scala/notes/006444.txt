Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the trauma SICU [**5-30**], was transiently
hypotensive with falling hct and was given a total of 8U PRBCs
in the ICU. Anemia was attribute to expansion of hematomas, as
CT was negative for retroperitoneal and abdominal bleeds and
guaiac negative throughout. Her coumadin was reversed, and she
was restarted on heparin [**6-2**], but became hypotensive
transiently with a hct drop to 24, so heparin was stopped,
accepting risk of thromboembolism. Once Hct and hemodynamically
stable,  heparin was restarted with goal PTT 60-80. Coumadin
restarted 24 hours later with goal INR 2.5-3.5. She was observed
36 hours and then discharged to rehab with Hct 32.5, INR 1.3,
PTT 78.

1. Falls: Unclear etiology, though likely multifactorial,
partially mechanical as she was turning quickly on the stairs at
the time. In addition, suspect contribution from deconditioning
and multiple sensory defects. It is unclear if she was
orthostatic prior to her hematoma. No evidence of seizure,
arrhythmia, or MI by history, and head CT wnl. Discharged to
rehab for physical therapy and home safety evaluation.

2. T12 compression fracture: Compression fracture s/p fall in
this osteoporotic elderly woman. Pain was well-controlled with
MS Contin [**Hospital1 **], calcitonin intra-nasal, and tylenol. Discharged
with TLSO brace, CaCO3, and vitamin D. Continue to hold fosamax,
given GI effects, recent blood loss and ho gastric varices.

3. MVR/afib: Stable irregularly irregular heartbeat throughout
admission. ECG Rate controlled with diltiazem SL. Heparin
restarted [**6-5**] and coumadin [**6-6**] with INR goal 2.5-3.5 and PTT
goal 60-80.

4. CAD/CHF: Held ASA and ACE-I in the setting of bleed and acute
renal failure. Plan to restart as outpatient. Clinically,
hypervolemic following multiple pRBC transfusions, but tolerated
diuresis well with resolution of mild CHF flare by discharge.

5. Acute renal failure: Creatinine 4.3 on DOA, likely due to
blood loss. Normalized following transfusions and returned to
baseline by discharge. Good urine output throughout.
