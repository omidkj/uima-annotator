Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none this hospitalization

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F h/o HTN, COPD (no home O2 requirement), paroxysmal Afib
brought in by ambulance from her independent living facility p/w
5 days of increasing dyspnea.  Pt reports baseline orthopnea
that worsened progressively until she had dyspnea at rest.  Pt
sleeps on 2 pillows at baseline; no PND.  Pt used to be on 20 mg
PO lasix daily, but this was stopped because "her doctor was
worried she was losing too much weight."  She was evaluated at
[**Hospital3 **] 1 month ago, given one dose of IV lasix, and
discharged home.  She was then on PO lasix for a few weeks, but
the lasix was discontinued a few days ago.  Pt states her lower
extremities occasionally swell but this has not been worse
recently.

Some nonproductive cough x2-3 days.  No fever, chills, N/V.  No
chest pain or hemoptysis.  No light-headedness or palpitations.
 She states her Afib is asymptomatic.  Pt used to be on
amiodarone and warfarin for her Afib, but these were both
discontinued several months ago.

Initial Vitals in the ED: 99.0, 89 (however, pt reports she
initially had a "very high HR" on presentation to the ED),
149/108, 22, 89% RA, 94% 4L nasal cannula, then 99% 15L
non-rebreather.  Pt received albuterol/ipratropium nebs,
methylprednisolone IV 125mg, full dose ASA, and levofloxacin.
Lasix 40mg IV given once.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt appears comfortable, speaking in full
sentences.  SpO2 98-100% on RA.

Past Medical History:
Macrocytic anemia, on IM vitamin B12 as outpatient
Hx of GI Bleed [**1-29**] dieulafoy's ulcer, subsequently cauterized
COPD (last PFTs on [**2129-4-27**]: FEV1 65%, FEV1/FVC 76%;
pulmonologist is Schwarztein)
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (used to be on amiodarone and
warfarin; stopped several months ago)
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Chronic low back pain
Hypothyroidism
Colon polyp
Depression
s/p bilateral cataract surgery

Social History:
Lives independently at [**Location (un) 5481**], performs all ADLs, drives
car. Former tobacco, quit 30 yrs ago (prior 3 ppd habit).  Wine
with dinner. No illicits.


Family History:
Father had MI @ 86. No sudden deaths. No pacemakers.  No cancer.

MICROBIOLOGIC DATA:
[**2133-3-9**] Blood culture - pending
[**2133-3-9**] Blood culture - pending

.
EKG: Afib with HR 110s, left axis deviation, LAFB, ? old
anteroseptal infarct (q waves V1-V2)
.
IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2133-3-9**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - Flattening of the diaphragms is
consistent with known history of emphysema. Increased vascular
marking with upper redistribution and interstitial thickening is
present. Ill defined opacities are noted in both lung bases.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted, left worse
than right, with concurrent bibasilar atelectases. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly and severe
degenerative changes of the right AC joint are again seen.
.
REPEAT CXR:
Cardiomegaly is unchanged from the prior examination. Bilateral
lungs appear clear with no focal consolidation. Hyperinflated
lungs and flattening of the diaphragms appear consistent with
known history of emphysema. Blunting of the costophrenic angles,
especially on the lateral views, may represent pleural
effusions. There has been improvement in the interstitial edema
since the most recent prior examination.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF ~ 25-30 %) with septal hypokinesis/akinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with moderately to severely
depressed free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
(given the low stroke volume) consistent with mild aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the report
of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2123-5-25**],
biventricular systolic function is now imparied. Mitral
regurgitation is now significantly increased. Tricuspid
regurgitation is now more prominent. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is now higher.
