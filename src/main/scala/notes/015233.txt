Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29436**] is a 78 year old man with a history of Chronic
Myelogenous Leukemia, Congestive Heart Failure and Chronic
Kidney Disease who presented with fever and cough, was then
found to have relative hypotension despite IVF resuscitation,
and was admitted to the medical ICU for possible sepsis and
hemodynamic monitoring.
.
Hospital course by problem:
.
#. [**Name (NI) **] Pt has had fevers, confusion and has bilateral
infiltrates on chest xray. He was treated with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin in ED. The likely etiology of the pt's chest xray
findings is bacterial, but with a history of CML the pt may be
immunocompromised and at risk for fungal infection. Blood
cultures, galactomannan and glucan were sent and were
unremarkable.
Initially in the ICU the pt was continued on ceftriaxone 2g QD
and azithro 500mg QD which was later changed to cefpodoxime and
azithro on discharge.
.
#. [**Name (NI) **] The pt's hypotension was likely secondary to
infection and improved with intravenous fluids and temporary
discontinuation of the pt's home metoprolol and [**Name (NI) **].
.
#. Altered mental status- On admission the pt was alert and
oriented to person, place and time but had cognitive slowing and
poor recall. This was attributed to delirium secondary to the
pt's infection.  The patient's delirium cleared during his
admission.
.
#. CHF- On admission the pt appeared euvolemic, and given his
hypotension the pt's home lasix dose was held. This was
restarted on discharge.
.
#. CKD- On admission the pt's creatinine had increased to 2.1
from a baseline of 1.6. This was likely due to prerenal azotemia
in the setting of increased insensible losses due to infection
and decreased oral intake. The pt's creatinine improved after
receiving approximately 3L IVF in the ED.
.
#. Left ventricle thrombus- On admission the pt was
supratherapeutic on coumadin with an INR of 3.6. Coumadin was
held in the ICU.  The patient's INR was stable at 2.0 on
discharge after reinitiation of coumadin for several days.  He
was briefly on a heparin ggt due to concern that he may become
subtherapeutic (which he did very briefly to INR of 1.9).
-Patient discharged on coumadin 4 mg po qd x3 days with VNA to
provide home INR checks to ensure that patient remains
therapeutic.
.
Epistaxis/Bloody Sputum)  The patient had epistaxis and very
bloody sputum for which he was monitored.  This improved over
the course of his hospitalization.
.
Anemia)  In the setting of the patient's bloody sputum and
epsitaxis his hct went down to 23 and he was transfused 1 unit
PRBC.
