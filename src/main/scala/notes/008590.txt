Service:  #58

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is comatose and intubated
following fall.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 79 year-old man is 13 days
status post revision of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal
shunt.  Postoperatively, he has been doing extremely well.
He has gone from barely taking a few steps with the walker to
walking around the block unassisted.  The speech and
mentation have also improved significantly.  At midnight the
patient got up to go to the bathroom.  He was found to have a
loud fall.  He was found by his family on the floor.  They
believe he struck his head initially on the door and then on
the floor.  Initially he was awake and alert with no
complaints.  He was put back to bed.  Later that evening he
began complaining of headache.  He became sleepier and more
lethargic.  He was described as having tremors in all four
extremities.  By the next morning the patient was
unresponsive.  He was taken by ambulance to the [**Hospital3 9683**] Emergency Room.  A CT scan of the head was obtained.
This showed an enormous left sided subdural hematoma with
significant mass effect and shift.  The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**]
coma score was reported to be 11.  He became vomiting and was
intubated for airway protection.  He was then transferred for
further care.  A CT scan in the Emergency Room once again
demonstrated a large, acute, left subdural hematoma with
significant shift.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Penicillin and
seafood.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Vasotec.
2.  Verapamil.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
4.  Lipitor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has been treated with radiation
therapy for prostate cancer.  This left him with a radiation
cystitis.  He has had frequent episodes of hematuria.  He
also has a history of a large thoracic aortic aneurysm.  This
has been followed for some time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is intubated and sedated.
He has a well healed small right frontal incision.  His
pupils are small.  His cranial nerves are otherwise intake.
He does not respond to deep pain.  His pulse is 88 and
regular.  His blood pressure is approximately 150/100.  His
chest is clear.  His abdomen is soft and nontender.  His
extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His toes
are downgoing.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
emergently on the day of admission.  At that time there was
an enormous acute left sided subdural hematoma.  This was
evacuated and a subdural drain left in place.  Over the next
48 hours there was minimal drainage from his Hemovac drain.
His blood pressure was well controlled in the 150 range with
both po and intravenous Hydralazine.  The patient remained
afebrile.  A follow up CT scan of the head was obtained.
This showed that the vast majority of the subdural hematoma
had been removed.  There is a tiny occipital portion, which
remain.  There was no shift.  There was minimal mass effect.
The patient's neurological status at this point was as a
restless thrasher.  He would have episodes where he was
extremely agitated.  All four extremities needed to be
restrained.  He was requiring significant amounts of
sedation.  He occasionally would follow commands with his
upper extremities.  He was moving all extremities
spontaneously.  He remained intubated.

The patient's main postoperative problem included persistent
hypertension, one episode of hematuria, extensive pulmonary
secretions and agitation.  The patient had a single episode
of hematuria.  This was successfully managed with irrigation.
 This was felt secondary to his radiation cystitis and was
not a long term problem.  His hematocrit remained stable.
Multiple attempts over the patient's hospitalization to
extubate.  However, these were limited by the patient's
copious secretions and poor gag reflex.  He was
intermittently diuresed with remaining secretions.  For that
reason he was trached for airway protection and management of
his secretions.  Multiple attempts were made to place a PEG.
However, because of the patient's known thoracic aortic
aneurysm his prior VP shunt, these were unsuccessful.
Eventually a PEG was successfully placed on [**2152-11-1**] by the
interventional radiologist.  This was to be used beginning
[**2152-11-2**].  The patient's blood pressure was reasonably
maintained in the 150 to 170 range with both largely po and
to a lesser extent intravenous Hydralazine.  The patient's
wounds remained clean and dry.  His scalp suture should be
removed in one week.  A third CT scan was obtained.  This
showed no evidence of any acute bleeding whatsoever.  The
previous small left occipital subdural had evolved and now
was more chronic in appearance.  It was felt that the patient
was an excellent rehab candidate.  It was hoped that he will
show significant neurologic recovery.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hydrocephalus.
2.  Acute subdural hematoma.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Radiation cystitis.
5.  Pulmonary edema.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient is being discharged for rehab.
He is felt to be an excellent rehabilitation candidate.
