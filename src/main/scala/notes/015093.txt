Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-11-9**] Mitral Valve Repair(Resection of P2, 32 mm Annuloplasty
Ring) and Ligation of Left Atrial Appendage


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80207**] is a 58 year old male with known history of heart
murmur, mitral regurgitation(MR). Over the past year, he had
noted worsening dypsnea on exertion. Echocardiogram from [**Month (only) 359**]
[**2124**] showed severe MR with left atrial enlargement. His left
ventricle was dilated, and LV function was normal between
55-60%. Cardiac catheterization in [**2125-10-6**] showed normal
coronary arteries. Based upon the above results, he was referred
for mitral valve surgery.

Past Medical History:
Heart Murmur, Mitral Regurgitation

Social History:
Denies tobacco. Admits to only occasional ETOH. Married, lives
with his wife. Employed by [**Company 80208**]-Lay.

Family History:
Brother had MI at age 52. Father with "heart disease".

Physical Exam:
Discharge exam:
Vitals-98.8, 130/67, 78   20, 98%RA
General- NAD
Lungs- mostly CTAB with slight crackles at the left base
Heart- irregularly irregular, no murmur or rug
Abdomen- NABS, soft, non-tender, non-distended
Extremities- 2+pitting edema bilateral lower extremities
Neuro- grossly intact
Incision- sternum: c/d/i, no erythema or drainage

Pertinent Results:
[**2125-11-9**] Intraop TEE
PRE Bypass
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet
flail. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST Bypass
LV systolic function is borderline normal (LVEF 50-55%). RV
systolic function remains normal. An annular ring prosthesis is
visualized in the mitral position. There is now trace mitral
regurgitation. The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80207**] was admitted and underwent mitral valve repair and
left atrial appendage ligation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. For surgical
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident.  He was transferred to the step
down unit where he made excellent progress.  The patient did go
into atrial fibrillation on the evening of [**11-10**].  He remained
hemodyhamically stable.  The patient was treated with IV beta
blocker and oral amiodarone.  He remained in rate-controlled
atrial fibrillation.  Coumadin was initiated.  Hospital course
was otherwise uneventful.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient made excellent
progress with physical therapy, showing good strength and
balance before discharge.  He was diuresed toward his
preoperative weight.  The patient was discharged home in good
condition on POD 4.
