Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 68 year old Russian speaking male with Hodgkins
Lymphoma (in remission, last chemo end of [**Month (only) 958**]) CAD/CHF, and
atrial fibrillation admitted with dyspnea on exertion and lower
extremity edema. Since the end of [**Month (only) 958**], patient has had an
increasing amount of lower extremity edema, [**Hospital1 **] dyspnea on
exertion.  He used to be able to walk 10 blocks and now is able
to walk [**1-31**] block without shortness of breath.  Per patient's
wife, he had an abdominal ultrasound which showed ascites and a

with some relief. He had a cough with white sputum and remained
afebrile. He was admitted to the medicine service for further
evaluation and treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Cardiovascular - the patient was initially treated on for
decompensated CHF with IV lasix, aldactone, and ACE inhibitor.
He was resistant to this regimen, and Natrecor was added on
[**7-29**].  He continued to be difficult to diurese due to
hypotension.  On [**7-30**] he became febrile and hypotensive (BP
70-80s), and Ciprofloxacin was added for a UTI.  On [**7-31**] he
continued to be hypotensive and was transferred to the CCU for
tailored diuresis.  In the CCU he was diuresed and received
milrinone, with successful diuresis and improvement in his
respiratory status.  He was transfered from the CCU on [**8-3**], but
later that day became febrile and hypotensive and was sent to
the MICU for presumed sepsis.  He was treated and returned to
the floor on [**8-8**].  Since that time he has continued to diurese
slowly with lasix IV, with slow improvement in his CHF on exam
and CXR.  He has remained stable, with SBP 90-115 and O2 sats
95-98% on 2L.  On discharge he is felt to be slightly volume
overloaded, but requires very gentle diuresis to avoid
hemodynamic decompensation and intravascular volume depletion.
Pt. converted from captopril 6.25 tid to lisinopril 2.5 qhs (has
been unable to tolerate higher doses secondary to hypotension)
and Lasix 40 mg po qd. Followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] arranged.

Rhythm - the patient was been in Afib throughout his course.  He
has been rate controlled in the 70-80s.  His digoxin has been
held due to NSVT (see below).  He has been anticoagulated on a
heparin drip, but has begun to bridge to coumadin 5 mg po qd
starting on [**2116-8-17**].  He has also had numerous episodes of NSVT,
including one 25 beat run; he remains on Toprol 50 qd both for
rate control and ectopy suppression.  He was seen by the
electrophysiology service, who recommend VT ablation, followed
by placement of a biventricular pacer, at some point in the near
future after his acute issues have resolved (especially his
current infections). Pt. will follow up with electrophysiology.

Ischemia - the patient has long-standing chest pain that has
been unchanged during his course.  Multiple EKGs have shown no
changes concerning for acute ischemia.  Troponins were briefly
elevated to 0.14 immediately after his MICU course, but this was
felt to be due to severe CHF and his concurrent renal
insufficiency at that time.

2) Respiratory - His saturations have remained stable during his
stay.  They continue to be low (90%) on room air but improve to
high 90s with 2L by NC.  On [**8-3**] he developed fever, hypotension,
and respiratory distress (RR 40), and on transfer to the MICU
was felt to have a pneumonia on CXR (presumed due to
aspiration).  This has been treated with zosyn IV (14 day
course).  On [**8-13**] he again developed confusion and respiratory
distress with no new infiltrate on CXR, and vancomycin IV was
added for a 7 day course. A RIJ catheter was removed. He has
since had no respiratory distress, and his lung exam and O2 sats
have improved to the high 90s on 2L.  He remains at 100% on 4 L.

3) Heme - In the CCU, the patients platelets fell to 53K.  This
was initially presumed due to HIT and the pt was switched to
argatroban.  HIT antibodies were subsequently negative x2, his
platelets have recovered to >150, and he resumed a heparin drip
for anticoagulation for Afib when he returned to the floor after
the MICU on [**8-8**].  His platelets have been stable since.  On his
transfer to the MICU, he had INR>30 and PTT>150, in the context
of elevated AST/ALT/bilirubin; this was felt to be due to shock
liver caused by sepsis.  Since his return to the floor, his INR
has slowly fallen to 1.3, and his PTT has returned to
therapeutic levels on a heparin drip.  Coumadin was started on
[**8-17**] for afib. The hematology service consulted on and followed
the patient throughout his stay.

4) ID - On transfer to the CCU on [**7-31**] the patient was febrile to
104, and was treated for a UTI with ciprofloxacin.  He was
transferred to floor on [**8-3**], but again became febrile to 102.4;
he was transferred to the MICU for sepsis and treated with zosyn
iv for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  He was also found to have
bilateral mastoiditis (R>L) by head CT, and was started on
tobramycin drops (14 day course) to
