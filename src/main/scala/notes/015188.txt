Chief Complaint:
IPH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
G-Tube [**2108-1-11**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 54563**] is a 68 year-old right-handed woman with a history
of
hypertension and COPD (on 2L supplemental O2 at baseline) who
initially presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital following the onset of
severe right-sided headache associated with fall and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when imaging demonstrated a right
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage associated with about 9 mm
of
midline shift.
.
The patient explains she awakened with a right-sided headache at
about 6 am this morning.  Despite the discomfort, she enjoyed
breakfast with her husband.  She asked for aspirin to treat the
discomfort at about 8 am. Her husband then went to a different
part of the house.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 54563**] shares that the headache subsequently became much
worse, reaching a peak intensity of [**8-27**].  The syndrome was
associated with nause and vomiting.  She does not recall
becoming
dizzy or falling.  However, her husband did hear a loud thud.
He
subsequently found the patient on the ground, unable to get up
independently.  At that time she was dysarthric.  He did not
notice if she was weak on one side.  Emergency services were
called and the patient was transported to [**Hospital **] Hospital.
.
Upon evaluation at [**Location (un) **] she was found to have a T of 98, p
81,
bp 143/50, rr 16, and O2 sat if 100% on 2L.  Notes document a
left facial droop.  A non-contrast CT of the head was done.  The
study was thought to show a large right IPH associated with 9mm
of midline shift.  She was subsequently transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**].

Past Medical History:
- COPD, on 2L suppl O2 at baseline
- Hypertension
- Hypothyroidism
- Right rotator cuff injury
- Depression


Social History:
- lives with husband
- has children


Family History:
- positive for abdominal aortic aneurysm (mother)
- negative for known neurological conditions including cerebral
aneurysm, stroke, seizure


Physical Exam:
On discharge:
Gen: NAD, Sometimes lethargic but arousable
Pulm: Wheezing with barrel chest. Crackles at the bases
bilaterally
Abd:
Ext: No edema
CV: RRR systolic murmur best heard at RUSB
Neuro: Alert and oriented to hospital and [**Location (un) 86**]. You will
sometimes get the name of the hospital right. Your language is
fluent with intact repetition. You naming is intact to high
frequency objects.
Pupils are Equal and reactive, you have a right facial droop.
your tongue does deviate slightly to the left.
Your left side is hemiplegic with reflexive movements to painful
stimuli. Your right side was anti-gravity. Your gait and
coordination were not tested at discharge.

Pertinent Results:
[**2108-1-6**] CXR: Severe emphysema. No edema or pneumonia. No
appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size normal. Bilateral
healed rib fractures are chronic. No
pneumothorax.

[**2108-1-10**] CXR: G tube tip is in the stomach. The side port is at
the GE junction. The lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal contours
are normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Healed
left rib fractures are noted.

[**2108-1-5**] NCHCT: In comparison to [**2108-1-1**] exam, there is no
significant change in large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage
with mass effect leading to 8 mm leftward shift of normally
midline structures, minimal-mildly increased from prior. There
is no new focus of intracranial hemorrhage. Close followup and
further workup for the etiology as clinically indicated.

[**2108-1-3**]: ECG:
Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat. Right atrial
abnormality. Right
bundle-branch block. Rightward axis. Consider prior inferior
myocardial
infarction, although it is non-diagnostic. Findings may be due
to right
ventricular overload/right ventricular hypertrophy. Clinical
correlation is
suggested

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 54563**] is a 68 year-old right-handed woman with a history
of hypertension and COPD (on 2L supplemental O2 at baseline) who
initially presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital following the onset of
severe right-sided headache associated with fall and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when imaging demonstrated a right
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage associated with about 9 mm
of
midline shift.  Initial neurological examination was notable
fordysarthria, pupillary asymmetry (L pupil 0.5 mm > R pupil),
failure to blink to threat from the left, incomplete horizontal
movement of eyes into extreme left lateral gaze, left facial
droop, left hemiparesis (UE>LE), increased tone in the left
upper extremity, left extensor response, and extinction of left
visual and tactile stimuli with double simultaneous stimulation.
 Repeat imaging demonstrated stability of the lesion.
Investigatory
studies are unrevealing. The location is suspicious for
underlying mass or vascular malformation.  A CTA was done which
did not demonstrate any large vascular malformation at the site
of the IPH. There were small saccular dilatations at the site of
right posterior communicating artery and anterior communicating
artery, to which aneurysm can't fully be ruled out. She was
transferred to the wards for further management. On the wards
she was placed once again on mannitol given lethargy and a
repeat CT head concerning for increased mass effect. She was
taken off mannitol on [**2108-1-9**] and was followed with serial blood
osmolality checks after improving clinically. She had a G-Tube
placed on [**2108-1-11**] for nutritional support. She was on continuous
oxygen by NC throughout her stay on the wards.

She still requires daily chem 7 panel to monitor for
normalization of sodium after manittol was discontinued.
  She will require an MRI/A when the blood clears out to better
evaluate the etiology in 6 weeks.
