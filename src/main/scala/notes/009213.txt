lethargic and
was intubated for airway protection with an observed respiration
rate of 5.  She received 3L NS and several levophed boluses for
persistent hypotension but small amounts made her hypertensive
She underwent a CXR, head CT for ? code stroke, and a CT

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2134-12-11**]: changes of prior thoracotomy on the left.  Bibasilar

atelectasis without definite consolidation or evidence for
congestive heart failure identified.
.
CT HEAD [**2134-12-11**]: Limited study due to patient motion.  Allowing
for this, no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

.
CTA C/A/P [**2134-12-11**]:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  Tortuous intrathoracic
aorta status post repair without evidence of dissection, leak,
or aneurysmal dilatation.
2.  New right upper lobe paraseptal thickening concerning for an
interstitial pneumonia.
3.  Fatty liver.
4.  Calcified right thyroid nodule, unchanged since [**2134-1-4**].
5.  Gallbladder filled with stones and sludge.
6.  Constipation.

MRI/MRA Brain: Pending at time of discharge

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 yo female with h/o paraplegia, ? COPD on 2L O2 at home
at night presents with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status,
hypotension, PNA and UTI requiring intubation; subsequently
extubated and returned to home O2 requirement without event.
.
*Hypoxia: Patient had transient hypoxia in the ER, although
etiology of hypoxic and bradycardic event unclear.  COPD flare
possible.  Little evidence of PNA, tox screen negative, patient
denies overdose on medications, no evidence of PE by CTA.
Patient was intubated for airway protection in the setting of
mental status changes (not for hypoxia) and was rapidly weaned
from the ventilator and extubated without complication.
Initially required 100% FiO2 by shovel mask to maintain SaO2 in
low 90s but oxygenation rapidly improved with SaO2 in low to mid
90s with 2L O2 by nasal cannula.  She will be discharged with
Levofloxacin and steroid taper for presumed COPD flare.
.
*Hypotension: Etiology again unclear.  Cardiac enzymes negative,
no events on telemetry, no culture proven sepsis, no evidence
adrenal insufficiency with cosyntropin stimulation.  Initially
started on levophed for blood pressure support (SBP's in 70's,
unresponsive to fluid boluses), but able to rapidly titrate off.
 She initially received Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric
broad-spectrum treatment of sepsis in this patient who resides
at an extended care facility.  At discharge, suspicion for
infection was low, and plan is to complete a 5 day course of
levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia, as presumed most
likely source if there were a true infection.
.
*MS changes: Initially w/ waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
changes, likely delirium in the setting of hypotension vs
infection vs seizure vs stroke.  Head CT and LP were negative.
Mental status rapidly improved to baseline.  Scheduled for
outpatient MRI/MRA to assess for possible seizure focus vs. CVA.
 At time of discharge, she was assessed to be at her neurologic
baseline.
.
Rectal pain: Patient developed burning rectal pain during course
of admission.  No evidence of fissure/hemorrhoids by exam.
Patient historically has no sensation in perineum [**1-6**]
paraplegia.  No relief with analgesics.  Likely due to referred
neuropathic pain in setting of held gabapentin during acute
illness.  Baclofen, nortriptyline, and neurontin were restarted
prior to discharge, per home regimen.
