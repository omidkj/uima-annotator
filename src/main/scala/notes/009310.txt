History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74316**] is a 58 year old man with h/o nephrolithiasis, HLD,
asthma, who is being transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with
concern for TTP.
.
The patient was evaluated 2 days prior to admission for back
pain. The patient noted a sudden onset of back pain while
playing golf. He was evaluated in the ED, determined to be
stable at that time, and was discharged home with pain
medications. Platelets were noted to have decreased from 189 in
[**5-26**] to 114 at that time. The following day, the patient
presented to his PCP's office with abdominal pain, nausea, and
vomiting. He was noted to be icteric and appeared generally
unwell and was referred back to the ED. The abdominal pain was
described as sharp and worst in the epigastric region, with
radiation to his back, shoulder, and the rest of his abdomen. He
had nausea and vomiting. He has also been coughing and has been
bringing up bloody sputum. No diarrhea or bloody bowel
movements. The patient notes a 10 pound weight loss in the past
week, poor appetite, and poor PO intake. He has had chills and
sweats, but no fevers. He has felt worse shortness of breath
over the last 2 days. Decreased urine output while he has been
hospitalized, but reports normal output prior to that time. He
recently traveled to [**Country **] in [**2192-5-17**]. He does not eat any
red meat or pork and has not had any undercooked meat recently.

.
The patient presented to the OSH [**2192-7-6**], where he was found to
have labs notable for WBC 15 (75% bands), Cr 4.5 (1.2 the day
prior to admission at the OSH), Tbili 23, Dbili 15, platelets
24. Peripheral smear was evaluated by Heme/Onc and showed e/o
schistocytes. UCx and BCx were drawn and are negative to date.
CT abdomen/pelvis was unremarkable. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1356**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10595**] from Heme/Onc
recommended treatment for possible TTP with pheresis, which [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital is unable to offer. The patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Prior to transfer, the patient was
hemodynamically stable, alert and oriented, and was only c/o a
mild headache.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient was conversant, AOx3. He
noted abdominal pain, which improved with Dilaudid. He was
coughing up blood-tinged frothy sputum during the interview. The
patient then became agitated and was noted to be requiring
increasing O2. He was electively intubated. The patient was
suctioned for a moderate amount of bloody secretions. He was
bronched at the bedside, which showed frothy bloody secretions.

Micro (OSH):
Babesia and Erlichia smears negative

Images:
[**7-6**] CXR (OSH): There is questionable minimal right lower lobe
infiltrate, not present on the prior chest x-ray of [**2191-3-8**].
No other abnormality is seen.

[**7-6**] Abdominal U/S (OSH): Negative for acute abnormality. There
is no explanation for abdominal pain. The right kidney shows
diffuse increase in the echogenicity of the cortex likely due to
diffuse parenchymal disease.

[**7-5**] CT abdomen/pelvis (OSH):
1. No evidence of obstructive uropathy or nephrolithiasis
2. Sequelae of granulomatous disease
3. Mildly enlarged prostate; correlate with PSA.
4. Bilateral hip osteoarthritis

EKG: NSR at 81, normal axis and intervals, TWI in aVL, no other
ST-Twave abnormalities, unchanged from prior EKG from OSH
