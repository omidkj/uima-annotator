HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old woman with
history of diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure
recently diagnosed, atrial fibrillation, who presents with
progressive shortness of breath, increasing lower extremity
edema for the last one to two weeks.

The patient reports approximately one year ago she could walk
about half mile without any problems at all.  Since then,
especially in the last few months she has had decreasing
exercise tolerance, increasing dyspnea on exertion, though
she was still able to walk around her house and perform her
activities of daily living.  In [**Month (only) 216**] she first presented to
her primary care physician complaining of these symptoms and
has been treated symptomatically since then with
beta-blockers and Ace inhibitor and an echo obtained in
[**Month (only) 216**] of this year showed congestive heart failure with four
chamber dilatation, Arteriosclerotic disease, MR, Tricuspid
regurgitation, ejection fraction of 30 to 40% with severe
wall motion abnormalities and pulmonary hypertension.

Over the last several weeks, she has had progressively
worsening dyspnea on exertion to the point where she can no
longer walk across the room without becoming severely short of
breath.  She denies shortness of breath at rest.  Although her
family reports that they see her and she appears to be short
of breath when sitting.  The patient also reports increasing
lower extremity edema with decreasing urination for the last
one or two weeks.  She has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at
baseline with an increased frequency of this recently now
occurring multiple times per night.  She denies any chest
pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, or nocturia.  Also reports
recently that she had episode of gastroenteritis with nausea
and vomiting and in that setting was directed to stop taking
some of her diuretics and Ace inhibitors.  This occurred
approximately two to three weeks ago and so for the last
several weeks she has not been on her usual medication
regimen for her congestive heart failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus Type II.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Congestive heart failure as detailed in history of
present illness.
4.  Breast cancer, status post lumpectomy and radiation
treatment to her left breast in [**2147**] and then status post
left mastectomy in [**2152**].
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Pulmonary hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATION ON ADMISSION:
1.  Coumadin 10
2.  Metformin 1000 mg twice a day.
3.  Glyburide.
4.  Procardia Extended Release 60.
5.  Tamoxifen 20 mg
6.  Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg
7.  K-Dur 20 mg

She had also been prescribed Lopressor 25 mg twice a day,
Lasix 20 mg, Lisinopril 20 mg and Prandin 7.5 mg twice a day
but it was not clear if the patient was taking these last
four medications.

FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband and
40'ish son.  She reports that she was previously independent
in her activities of daily living but has required
assistance in the last several weeks secondary to short of
breath.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96, heart rate 100, pulse
112/71.  Respiratory rate 28.  O2 sats 96 to 98% on room air.
In general this was a pleasant woman sitting straight upright
using accessory muscles for breathing, speaking in short
sentences and clearly in mild respiratory distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Exam was notable for a left
subconjunctival hemorrhage with full extraocular movements
and no pain, tenderness or discharge from her left eye. Neck
showed no lymphadenopathy.  2+ carotids, a large goiter and
JVP over 14 cm reaching as high as the angle of her jaw while
she was upright.  Heart:  Remarkable for tachycardia with an
irregular rhythm.  S1 and S2 were present as well as a 2/6
systolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla.
Lung exam was notable for decreased breath sounds at the
basis, left greater than right, slightly coarse breath
sounds, scattered expiratory wheezes but no crackles.
Abdominal exam was soft and nontender with positive bowel
sounds and a positive fluid wave.  Extremities were warm and
well perfused with palpable dorsalis pedis pulses but had 4+
pitting edema to the knees bilaterally.  Neurological:  Left
pupil was surgical and nonreactive.  The right pupil was
reactive.  Otherwise unremarkable.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  CBC and Chem 7 were notable only
for a potassium of 3.5, creatinine 1.0 at patient's baseline.
Urinalysis was notable for large blood, Protein 30,
urobilinogen 4, 6 to 10 red blood cells and few bacteria.
Electrocardiogram was atrial fibrillation with a rate of
approximately 100 compared to an electrocardiogram from [**2152**]
there were new inferior Q-waves in 3, 2 and AVF as well as
new poor R-wave progression.

Chest x-ray showed stable cardiac enlargement with increased
prominence of the pulmonary vessels and pulmonary vascular
redistribution as well as bilateral pleural effusions
consistent with congestive heart failure.

Echo from [**7-23**] showed four chamber dilatation with a large
Arteriosclerotic disease that had a left to right shunt.
Normal left ventricular wall thickness with an EF of 30 to
40% with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior
wall.  Right ventricular hypertrophy with abnormal septal
motion consistent with right ventricular pressure volume
overload.  Mild 1+ aortic insufficiency, severe 4+ mitral
regurgitation, moderately severe 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 58 to 64+ RA pressure
and no pericardial effusion.  Also of note on laboratory was
coagulation studies obtained the following morning that
showed an INR of 27 and on repeat was 38.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Congestive heart failure.  On presentation to the
hospital the patient's short of breath and lower extremity
swelling were attributed to an exacerbation of her congestive
heart failure likely from medication non-compliance due to
changing directions from her physician about which pills to
take secondary to intercurrent illnesses.  Additionally it is
likely that the patient also had some dietary indiscretion
with increased sodium intake.  On admission the patient's
short of breath and swelling were treated with doses of
intravenous Lasix however, initially she had poor response to
this with fall in urine output.  By the next morning, the
patient had significantly decreased urine output as well as
significant hematuria and management was complicated by her
severe coagulopathy as discussed in more detail below.
Therefore, she was briefly transferred to the CCU for further
management.  She was effectively treated with high doses of
intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn and began to have a
significant diuresis which improved her symptomatically and
after a two day stay in the CCU she was transferred back to
the regular floor where we continued to diurese her and
improve her symptomatically.  Additionally because the
congestive heart failure was of recent onset, workup was
undertaken to determine possible etiology for her dilated
cardiomyopathy.  Given the echo findings of severe wall
motion abnormalities as well as new electrocardiogram changes
suggestive of old inferior and anterior infarct the patient
had a pharmacological MIBI stress test which showed a large
moderate to severe fixed defect in the territory of the left
anterior descending and a large, partly reversible defect in
the territory of the right coronary artery.  Several days
later in consultation with the Heart Failure Service who was
consulted to help in the management of the patient's heart
failure it was decided to proceed with cardiac
catheterization for possible correction of ischemia in the
territory of the right coronary artery.  Coronary
catheterization demonstrated elevated left and right sided
pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 21 and
a pulmonary artery pressures of 41/21 as well as showing no
significant arteriosclerotic disease.  Coronary angiography
