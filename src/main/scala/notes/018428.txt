Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
HYPOTENSION

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular central venous catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79 yo M with a history of respiratory failure and
chronic vent dependence who presented from OSH with hypotension
coupled with history of fever and leukocytosis.
Per report the patient was at his facility and found to have
febrile and congested treated with lasix as CXR showed fluid
overload with possible pneumonia. However, he became hypotensive
and required pressor support. There were no MICU beds at OSH and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
While in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient was treated with pressors
(levophed) and ceftazadime as well as kayexelate for
hyperkalemia.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was asymptomatic without
shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, fever, chills, nausea
or vomiting. He was able to communicate with mouthing words.
He became tachycardic to the 140s with atrial flutter with
persistent hypotension. For this he was changed to phenylephrine
and given IV fluids

Initial KUB:
FINDINGS: Nonspecific dilated loops of small bowel are seen,
extending up to approximately 4 cm in diameter, which is similar
in degree when compared to the study of [**2185-7-26**]. A gastrostomy
tube is again seen, with the balloon at the tip projecting over
what is presumed to be the gastric bubble. No contrast was
administered through the tube to verify tube location. There is
a somewhat unusual appearance of the left femoral head,
presumably secondary to patient positioning.

IMPRESSION: Gastrostomy tube balloon and tip projects over what
is presumed to be the gastric bubble. Higher confidence in
localization could be obtained by obtaining a radiograph after
injecting the tube with contrast.
.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2185-8-8**] 2:55 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST

Reason: eval for interstitial lung disease vs chf
Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old man with unclear history asbestosis and COPD, recent
PEA arrest, difficult to wean vent, readmitted with VAP, need to
further delineate lung disease
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for interstitial lung disease vs chf
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Difficult to wean from vent.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT through the chest following
administration of IV contrast. Five, 1.25 mm collimation images
and coronal reformations were provided and reviewed.

FINDINGS: Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Multiple
lymph nodes in the prevascular, pretracheal, subcarinal and in
the hila bilaterally measure up to 11 mm in the subcarinal
station. Layering moderate - size bilateral pleural effusions
are nonhemorrhagic and associated with adjacent relaxation
atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The airways are patent to
segmental level. Very dense calcifications are in the left main,
LAD, left circumflex and right coronary arteries. There is
moderate cardiomegaly. There is no pericardial effusion. The
aorta is normal in caliber. Ground glass opacity, and
interlobular septal thickening in the upper lobes are consistent
with interstitial pulmonary edema. Ill-defined multifocal areas
of consolidation in the right upper lobe are likely infectious
in origin. There is paraseptal emphysema.

There are no bone findings of malignancy.

The imaged portion of the upper abdomen shows no abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:

1. CHF.

2. Multifocal areas of consolidation in the right upper lobe are
likely due to infectious process.

3. Bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Coronary calcifications.

4. Moderate cardiomegaly.

5. Reactive lymphadenopathy.
.

Last CXR [**8-10**]
CHEST, SINGLE VIEW: Again there is a right internal jugular
catheter with its tip projecting over the distal SVC and
tracheostomy tube in unchanged standard position. Persistent
cardiomegaly. Nontypical interstitial edema suggesting
coexisting emphysema. Layering effusions, right greater than
left, appear marginally increased on today's study.

IMPRESSION: Equivocally increased layering bilateral pleural
effusions. Essentially unchanged nontypical interstitial edema
with likely underlying emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo M with COPD, vent dependence who presents with pressor
dependent hypotension

Sepsis: Patient with persistent hypotension and not responsive
to pressors. Given leukocytosis with left shift and history of
fever, infection is likely.  Was initiall treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics and improved however, pressor requirement
again increased several days later and antibiotics were
continued.
Patient was given fluids but began to develop volume overload
.
#) ID: Likely secondary to infection in lungs, though other
sources of infection cannot be ruled out especially given that
the chest x-ray was no significantly different than [**7-30**].
Sputum culture showed pansensitive PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA
STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPHIDA.
.
#) Cardiac:
- Rhythm:A fib/ flutter: appears to go in and out of this.
Continued on amiodarone.
- Pump: Has likely diastolic dysfunction at baseline. Does have
signs of fluid overload on exam though with low CVP and likely
low filling pressures. Also with possible HOCM on last echo.
Therefore, may be very preload dependent explaining why patient
is sensitive to hypotension.
Diuresis was attempted but patient did not tolerate it and
required fluid boluses
- CAD: no signs CAD currently though does have slight troponin
leak. Will continue to follow ECGs.
.
#) Pulmonary hypertension/vent dependence: Unclear etiology and
treatment. Appears to be on sidenifil at baseline though
pulmonary pressures are not significantly elevated on echo.
Likely has multifactorial lung disease given appearance of
asbestos exposure, pulmonary hypertension and smoking history.
Suspect COPD component as well.  These issues ultimitely
worsened and given his overall status was difficult to treat
.
