Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
87-year-old diabetic male with diastolic dysfunction,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation & tachybrady
syndrome - recently hospitalized in [**2178-3-21**] for TEE
cardioversion and DDDR (dual chamber paced, dual chamber sensed,
dual response, rate modulated) placement, who is admitted to the
CCU with CHF decompensation.
.
According to patient's son-in-law, patient was in his usual
state of health until about 1 week ago when he began complaining
of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath, but he refused
hospitalization until the night of admission. With the
assistance of a Russian translator, the patient denies
orthopnea, PND, or significant dependent edema; also denies CP,
palpitations, nausea, and vomiting. Per his family, he did not
have any fevers or cough; there were apparent no changes in diet
or other precipitating events 1 week ago.
.
According to the [**2178-4-21**] EP letter, his functional status
improved markedly after his [**2178-3-21**] hospitalization. At the
time of the note, he was able to ambulate from bed to the
bathroom and back before becoming short of breath, suggestive of
class II-III heart failure; prior to this, he could only move
from bed to a chair before becoming short of breath.
.
Most recent TTE showed [**2-/2178**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with distal septal, anterior, and lateral severe
hypokinesis/akinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy consistent with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with overall normal function.
.
Most recent Cath showed [**2-/2174**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
circulation
demonstrated only mild non-obstructive CAD. The LMCA was free of
any
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The LAD was
free of
flow limiting disease. The D1 was of moderate size and had a
40-50%
stenosis in the proximal segment. The LCx had a 40% stenosis
after the takeoff of the OM2. The OM1 was a large vessel, but
OM2 was a moderate size vessel. The L-PL was also moderate size.
Neither had flow limiting disease. The RCA was a large vessel
and gave rise to the a moderate size R-PDA and small R-PL. There
were no flow limiting lesions in these vessels.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics from left heart catheterization

demonstrated moderately elevated LVEDP (20mmHg). There was no
transarotic pressure gradient upon catheter pullback.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated normal systolic LV
function. The calculated EF was 54%. There was no mitral
regurgitation appreciated.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild non-obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular systolic function.
3. Mild to moderate LV diastolic dysfunction.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 98.0 HR 100, 100/72, RR: 35,
96% on RA. He recieved 60mg of IV lasix (put out ~600cc) and
full ASA. CXR showed increased congestion suggestive of CHF
decompensatoin.
.
On arrival to the CCU, vitals were: T 96.3 HR 100, 115/73, RR:
29, 95% BiPAP of [**8-25**] with ABG 7.49/38/118/28. He was diuresed
with Lasix, rate controlled with metoprolol 5mg IV x 2, and
transitioned to 100% rebreather.
