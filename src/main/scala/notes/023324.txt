Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Known periampullary adenocarcinoma.

Major [**First Name3 (LF) 2947**] or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-1-25**]: Exploratory laparotomy with open pancreatic biopsy,

Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] was recently evaluated by my colleague when
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with obstructive jaundice.  He was managed
there with an ERCP performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which demonstrated
a large mass at the major papilla with a stricture the lower
through the common bile duct, obviously concerning for
malignancy.  He also underwent a CTA of the abdomen, which
demonstrated the likely ampullary carcinoma with associated
pancreatitis changes.  There was, however, no evidence of
vascular involvement and no metastases to preclude the attempt
at resection.  Once his jaundice has begun to resolve, plans
were made for him to be discharged home with outpatient followup
to arrange for an operative date.  Time has become available for
the [**2124-1-25**] and therefore, we have moved up clinic
appointment for today so that I could speak with him in more
detail about the upcoming intervention.  Today, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
reports that he is eating okay, but finds that he has had
diminished appetite as well as some abdominal pain going on
since [**Month (only) **] with gradual increase in severity of the
symptoms.

IMAGING:
Sinus tachycardia, rate 102. Left anterior hemiblock. Right
bundle-branch block. Inferior wall myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age cannot be excluded. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2124-1-10**] no significant change.

[**2124-1-24**] CXR: No evidence of acute process. COPD.
.
[**2124-1-25**] AP CXR:
ET tube in standard placement. Epidural catheter unchanged in
position.  Right jugular line tip projects over the mid SVC.
Lateral aspect of right lower chest is excluded from the
examination. The imaged portions of lungs and pleura are normal.
Heart size is normal. Apparent narrowing of the lower trachea is
more likely a projection of a posterior osteophyte,rather than a
tracheal lesion. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and
out of view.
.
[**2124-1-27**] AP CXR:
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. The lungs are grossly
clear and hyperexpanded. There are no new lung abnormalities,
pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. NG tube tip is in the
stomach. A right IJ catheter tip is in the SVC. Skin staples
project in the upper abdomen.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General [**Month/Day/Year 2947**] Service on
[**2124-1-25**] for evaluation and treatment of periampullary
adenocarcinoma.  On this date, the patient underwent exploratory
laparotomy with open pancreatic biopsy, cholecystectomy,
fiducial placement, gastrojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy for an intra-operative finding of ampullary
cancer metastatic to common hepatic arterial lymph node, which
went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative
Note for details). Due to depressed mental status, the patient
was brought to the PACU intubated. When awake, he was extubated,
but experienced hypertension, tachycardia, desaturation to 85%
and increased work of breathing. The patient was re-intubated
for hypercapnic respiratory distress. Post re-intubation CXR
revealed a small apparent narrowing of the trachea just distal
to the tip of the ETT, conceivably related to recent preceding
intubation. The patient was transferred to the SICU in stable
condition NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley
catheter in place, and a Dilaudid/Bupivacaine epidural for pain
control. In the SICU, the epidural was changed just to
Bupivacaine by APS due to sedation. Later, Fentanyl IV was added
to the pain control regimen due to ineffective pain control.
.
Due to the findings on re-intubation CXR, Intervention
Pulmonology was consulted. On [**2124-1-26**], a flexible bronchoscopy
was performed, which did not show subglottic tracheal stenosis
of the trachea endoscopically to any significant degree. The
mild extrinsic compression was felt to represent
lymphadenopathy. The patient was successfully extubated, and
later transferred to the inpatient floor.
.
Neuro: As above, the patient ultimately received a Bupivacaine
epidural with Fentanyl IV post-operatively with good effect and
adequate pain control. Prior to transfer to the inpatient floor,
the Bupivacaine epidural and Fentanyl were discontinued, and the
patient wasgiven Morphine IV PRN with continued good pain
control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications.
.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
Pulmonary: Re-intubated in PACU as outlined above. After
extubation, patient required Albuterol and Atrovent Nebulizer
treatments, aggressive respiratory toilet, and his Symbicort MDI
was initiated. CXR on [**2124-1-27**] revealed that the lungs were
grossly clear and hyperexpanded. There were no new lung
abnormalities, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. Waened off
supplemental oxygen on [**2124-1-29**]. The patient remained stable
from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely
monitored. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive
spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
