Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
48yoW with h/o ESLD [**3-6**] EtOH cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, chronic
kidney disease, transfered from [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-8**] for persistent
MRSA bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Admitted with PICC
Femoral HD catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
 48yoW with h/o ESLD [**3-6**] EtOH cirrhosis, Crohn's disease,
chronic kidney disease, who was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital [**2178-2-18**] with liver failure, acute renal failure and
hyponatremia, and is transferred now to [**Hospital1 18**] with persistant
MRSA bacteremia.
.
The patient was initially referred to [**Hospital3 417**] ED [**2178-2-18**]
from her primary care physician's office for evaluation of
elevated LFTs, confusion, ARF (Cr 3.4), and hyponatremia (Na+
124). At that time she complained of SOB and productive cough.
She was transferred to the ICU [**2178-3-3**] with hypotension (BP
65/40) and treated for urosepsis after E.coli grew in her urine.
She was treated with initially ceftriaxone and then aztreonam.
Hypotension was treated initially with Neosynephrine, and then
levophed. Baseline SBP 80s. Hospital course also complicated by
LLL pneumonia. She then developed a MRSA bacteremia. Exam was
significant for pericardial rub, and echo showed a
small-moderate effusion. No vegetations were seen on TTE
[**2178-3-1**], but she was treated for endocarditis with
vancomycin/gentamicin. A TEE was not done due to concern for
causing a variceal bleed. EF was 60-65%. On the gentamicin her
creatinine rose from 1.0 to 3.8. On [**2178-3-2**] she had a single
burst of non-sustained Afib. Hospital course was also
complicated by hypokalemia requiring repletion. Surveillance
blood cultures were persistantly positive for MRSA, most
recently [**2178-3-5**], despite therapeutic doses of vancomycin.
Additionally the LLL infiltrate enlarged on CXR. Abdominal U/S
on [**2178-3-2**] showed hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and reversed flow
in the portal vein. On [**2178-3-4**] she had a urine culture that grew
enterococcus. She was transferred on Levophed via PICC line in
left A/C vein.
.
Hospital course also complicated by indecision regarding code
status. She was initially DNR/DNI, then full code, then reverted
to DNR/DNI status prior to transfer.
.
On presentation now she complains of chest pain when coughing,
and cough productive of brown sputum. She denies SOB. She c/o
midepigastric abdominal pain and low back pain, which is her
baseline. She denies headache, dizziness, confusion, vision
changes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.

IMAGING:
CXR:
AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: There is a ill-defined opacity
within the left lower lobe consistent with patient's known
pneumonia in this region. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to
evaluate. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
normal limits. There is a small right pleural effusion. A left
PICC catheter terminates in the upper SVC. Cholecystectomy clips
in the right upper quadrant.

IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe consolidation consistent with
patient's known pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion.
.
Abd Ultrasound:
FINDINGS: This was a technically difficult examination and was
performed portably. The liver is heterogenous in echotexture and
is of increased echogenicity. It is shrunken and the appearances
are consistent with cirrhosis. There is evidence of ascites. The
flow in the main portal vein is reversed and is centrifugal. The
flow in the main hepatic artery reaches velocities of 80 cm/sec,
but there is a normal waveform and the resistive index is 0.77.
The flow in the right anterior portal vein is centripetal and
the flow in the right posterior portal vein is centrifugal. The
left portal vein is not well visualized. Normal waveforms are
seen in the right and left hepatic arteries. The flow in the
left hepatic vein, right hepatic vein and middle hepatic vein is
normal. No intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. The CBD measures
0.48 cm.

IMPRESSION: Technically difficult examination in a patient with
cirrhotic liver with ascites with reversed flow seen in the
portal veins. Ascites
.
ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
a small pericardial effusion.
.
MRI Abdomen:
FINDINGS: The liver is shrunken and nodular, consistent with the
given history of cirrhosis. Within the limits of the
