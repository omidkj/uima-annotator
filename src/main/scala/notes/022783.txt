Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was evaluated in the emergency room and films and
the complete history was discussed with the attending of record.


She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and ventilatory
support and management.  Given the devastating nature of her ICH
and her extensive past medical history extensive discussion was
undertaken with the family and the family chose against surgery.
They made her CMO.

In the morning of [**3-19**] the patients blood pressure dropped into
the 40s and at this point the family decided to withdraw support
and allow the patient to die. The patient became asystolic and
passed shortly after extubation.

An Autopsy was requested by the family.
