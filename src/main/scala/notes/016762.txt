Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain and nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
placement of temporary pacing wire

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1169**] is a 61 year old woman with remote family history of
CAD and no other know risk factors who presented with anterior
MI in process of completion as Q waves are present. She states
that she was in her usual state of health and was at work at an
outside hospital where she does housekeeping. She felt the onset
of nausea and right sided chest pain radiating to the right
scapula while cleaning blinds. She attributed this pain to a
pulled muscle but did not get relief when she stopped cleaning.
She rested the remainder of the day and then went home.
Overnight, she had no relief of her discomfort. The followind
day, she was too weak to walk, so she was transported to the
emergency department where she was found to have a left axis
deviation, Q waves anteriorly, and a right bundle branch block.
She went to cath and had a drug eluting stent placed in the LAD.
She also had a successful treatment of proximal LAD with
thrombectomy device.

Past Medical History:
none

Social History:
no tobacco, no EtOH
works as housekeeper
lives alone with her cat

Family History:
great aunts and grandmother with coronary disease

Physical Exam:
T 98.7, BP 78/53, HR 68, RR 20, 97% on RA
Gen: pleasant and cooperative
HEENT: MMM, no JVD
Cor: RRR no M/R/G
Pulm: CTAB no wheezes, rales, crackles
Abd: soft, NT, ND +BS
Ext: warm, well perfused, DP 2+ bilaterally, no edema

Pertinent Results:
Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior free wall, and
akinesis of the anterior septum and apex. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle (the left ventricle was opacified
with Definity echo contrast to exclude intracavitary thrombus).
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: extensive anteroseptal myocardial infarct

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system. The
LAD was totally occluded proximal to D1. The LMCA was
angiographically
normal. The LCX was a nondominant vessel with a 60% mid segment
occlusion. The RCA was a dominant vessel without disease. The
PLB had a
proximal 60% lesion.
2. Hemodynamics after PCI showed mildly elevated left sided
filling
pressures (PCWP mean 20 mm Hg) and mild pulmonary hypertension
(PASP 42
mm Hg).
3. Successful placement of 2.5 x 23 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent
in
the proximal LAD after Angiojet removal of thrombus and
postdilation
with a 2.75 mm balloon. Final angiography demonstrated no
residual
stenosis in the LAD proper, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and
normal flow (See PTCA Comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly elevated left sided filling pressures.
3. Successful treatment of proximal LAD with thrombectomy
device.
4. Successful treatment of proximal LAD with drug-eluting stent.

5. Late presentation of acute myocardial infarction treated by
PCI.
6. Door-to-balloon time of 31 minutes at [**Hospital1 18**].

ECG: Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior
fascicular block. Poor R wave progression with late precordial
QRS configuration - is
non-specific and could be due to lead placement or left axis
deviation/ left anterior fascicular block. Clinical correlation
is suggested for possible anteroseptal myocardial infarction,
age indeterminate. Since the previous tracing of [**2151-4-7**] no
significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1169**] was brought to the cath lab within 31 minutes. Her
intervention was without complications. A temporary pacing wire
was placed as she was at risk for heart block with her anterior
MI. After 48 hours on telemetry without heart block, her wire
was removed. The patient had an uneventful post cath course
aside from asymptomatic hypotension. According to the patient,
her blood pressure normally runs somewhat low. She was started
on beta blocker, statin, aspirin, and plavix. Once PT cleared
her, Ms. [**Known lastname 1169**] was discharged home on the aforementioned
medications and a low dose ACE inhibitor. She was discharged
with instructions to see an electrophysiologist for
consideration of ICD placement. She preferred to have her
medical care around her home in [**Location (un) 7658**] and said that her PCP
would locate [**Name Initial (PRE) **] local cardiologist for her.
