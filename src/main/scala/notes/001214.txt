AT DISCHARGE:


Pertinent Results:
- ECG:  LBBB at rate 90-112.  Greater than 5mm ST elevations
than previous, although hard to delineate ST baseline.
.
- ECHO:
[**12-27**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and basal
inferoseptal segments. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2143-1-15**], the findings appear similar.

- CARDIAC CATH:
RHC [**1-26**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right ventricular
filling
pressures with RVEDP 7 mmHg and mildly elevated left sided
filling
pressures with PCWP 19 mmHg. There was pulmonary arterial
hypertension with a mean PA pressures of 33 mmHg (PA prrresure
55/19 mmHg). The pulmonary vascular resistance was 157
dynes-sec/cm5. The cardiac index was normal at 3.26 L/min/m2.
2. Treatment with 100% FiO2 demonstrated lowering of the
pulmonary
artery resistance (97 dynes-sec/cm5) due to a rise in calculated
cardiac index (5.27 L/min/m2) with a stable PCW of 19 mmHg. The
mean PA pressure was measured at 33 mmHg.
3. Treatment with inhaled NO at 40 ppm in addition to 100% FiO2
did not change the pulmonary pressures significantly with a mean
PA pressure of 30mmHg. There was just a mild change in the mean
PCWP measured at 17 mmHg. The pulmonary artery resistance was
(107 dynes-sec/cm5) due to a rise in the calculated cardiac
index (4.43 l/min/m2).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension at baseline with no
improvement in
mean PA pressures with 100% o2 and iNO at 40ppm.
2. Mildly elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
.
LHC [**5-26**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this left-dominant system revealed
diffuse
coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was a small caliber vessel
without
disease.  The LAD had 60-70% calcified stenoses of the proximal
section, as well as the diagonal branch, and was occluded after
the mid-section. The LCX had sequential stenoses of the proximal
and distal LCX, with occluded OM1 and OM2 branches, and total
occlusion after the distal LCX. The RCA was a non-dominant
vessel with sequential 80% stenoses. 2. Selective graft
venography revealed a widely patent SVG-PDA and LPL graft.  The
SVG-OM1 graft had a 30-40% stenosis in the mid-SVG, and was
patent to the OM1 branch.
3. Selective graft arteriography revealed a widely patent
LIMA-LAD
graft. 4. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and
left-sided filling pressures, with mean RA pressure of 15 mmHg,
and mean PCW pressure of 30 mmHg.  The wedge tracing was notable
for a prominant v-wave with pressure of 51 mmHg, consistent with
possible mitral regurgitation. There was mild pulmonary
hypertension with mean PA pressure of 38 mmHg, and mild systemic
hypertension, with SBP of 140mmHg.  The cardiac output was
normal at 5.1 L/min.  There was no aortic stenosis detected by
pullback technique.
5. Nonselective left subclavian injection revealed a 70%
stenosis of the proximal left subclavian artery, with a 45 mmHg
pressure drop across the stenotic lesion.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Diffuse coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.
3. Mild pulmonary and systemic hypertension.
4. Subclavian stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient expired as explained in OMR Death Note summarized here:

At approximately 12:30AM, telemetry in the ICU demonstrated
ventricular tachycardia. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39070**] [**Name (STitle) 39071**] was present at bedside
and the patient was found to be pulseless. Code status was noted
to be DNR and he became asystolic shortly thereafter. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39071**]
called the time of death to be 12:36AM on [**2144-4-3**] after
listening
for breath sounds bilaterally and not appreciating any. He also
listened for heart sounds and did not appreciate any. He felt
for
peripheral pulses for 1 minute at both radial arteries, and did
not appreciate any. He had absent corneal reflexes bilaterally.
    Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39071**] has made several phone calls to patients brothers
in attempt to inform them of grave situation. Organ bank was
also
notified by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39071**] and they have declined.

Below is a brief summary of his hospital course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17029**] is a 67 year old man with a past medical history
significant for CABG, CAD, sCHF, DM, PVD, originally admitted
for RLE cellulitis who was transferred to the CCU after
developing acute pulmonary edema. His course was complicated by
pulseless VT arrest on [**3-21**] and respirat
