  RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2110-8-29**] 10:07 AM
Reason: interval change in PTX/acute lung process/pleural
effusion
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old woman with RULobectomy s/p pleural tap
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval change in PTX/acute lung process/pleural effusion
HISTORY: Right upper lobectomy. Following pleural tap.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-28**] and prior
films since [**2110-8-25**]:

There has been no change since [**8-27**]. Considerable consolidation
is still present at both lung bases, small-to-moderate right and
left pleural effusions are stable and there is no pneumothorax.
The heart is top normal size. The left internal jugular catheter
cannulates the azygous vein as it has for more than a week.

The persistent abnormality in the lower lungs has been
attributed to asymmetric edema, but the chronicity now begins to
suggest pulmonary hemorrhage, less likely pneumonia because both
areas were atelectatic when larger pleural effusions were
present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted SDA [**2110-8-12**] for Right upper lobectomy for RUL mass.
Pt tolerated procedure well and transferred to PACU in stable
condition, Ct x2 to sx. PACU course complicated by brief
administration of phenylephrine gtt and transfusion PRBC x2 for
HCT 25.
Pt transferred to floor POD#1 in stable condition. CTx2 output
of 120/465 POD#1, pain control w/ epidural- Dilaudid and
bupivicaine, PT consult, OOB, IS.
Epidural in place until POD#5 when chest tube x2 d/c.
Patient's post -op course complicated by:
Afib on POD#3 refractory to lopressor iv in large doses,with
rate 130-150 w/o response. Cardiology consult POD#6- Amiodarone
iv started, transitioned to po w/ good rate
effect,anticoagulation w/ Heparin gtt initiated, check TSH.  Pt
transitioned to lovenox and to coumadin (POD#6) w/ goal INR [**3-6**].
INR elevated w/ amiodarone, therefore coumadin held, and INR
corrected w/ FFP daily x3 days. No coumadin given up to
discharge w/ level 2.2 [**8-29**]. Lasix cont qd, brief administration
Diltiazem IV (POD#8)for rate control when unable to take po
meds, transitioned to po POD#10.
Intestinal impaction, mild ileus POD#8 w/ inability to tolerate
po intake, some nausea and vomitting. Rx given w/ resolution
POD#10, slowly increasing po intake. Prolapse of rectum reduced
x2 during this time.
Pleural effusions-O2 requirement increased (O2 sat 93-94%
3-3.5Lnc) and persisted despite lasix qd  w/ diminished BS and
DOE on  POD#13, with thoracentesis of right chest for 1300 cc,
and left chest of 900 cc; no complication with significant
improvement in respiratory status on POD#15-7/29/05 of O2 Sat
92% RA. In addition. intermittent episodes of NSR evident.
Patient discharged to home POD#15/PPD#2 to home w/ VNA services
and home O2. Coumadin andINR management by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2204**], MD
