Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2183-2-12**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the surgery service under
the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He was taken to the OR for resection.
For details of the operation, please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 6218**] operative
report. Postoperatively he was admitted to the ICU and placed on
an amiodarone drip due to rapid atrial fibrillation. His pain
was well controlled with an epidural. Cardiology and EPS were
consulted POD1 for assistance in controlling Mr. [**Known lastname 1226**]
tachycardia. Once stable, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the
floor on HD 3. His diet was slowly advanced. On the night of HD
4, he was found to be increasingly somnolent, difficult to
arouse, and unable to follow commands. His ABG was 7.27/51/66/24
and he was hypernatremic. He was transferred back to the ICU for
close monitoring. Due to increasing agitation Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25970**]d to pull out his foley, Dobhoff that had been placed
for tube feeding, and his IV. Geriatrics was consulted for his
mental status changes and felt that his pain medication may have
contributed to his confusion. His pain was now well controlled
with tylenol only. He was transferred back to the floor on POD 8
with a 1:1 sitter. He gradually became slightly more alert and
oriented as his hypernatremia was corrected. His diet was
advanced to regular, however his po intake was poor. Supplements
and TPN were initiated. On HD 20, TPN, PICC and foley were
d/c'd. Pts PO intake remained poor. His BUN and creatinine
continued to rise. On HD 22, IVF were reinitiated. HD 23,
substantial increase of K to 6.5 with increase BUN to 80 and
creatinine 2.1. Urine lytes were ordered along with stat EKG.
Renal was consulted. Gerientology continued to follow pt and
provide recs. Notable decline in mental status and increase in
agitation. Pts state continued to decline with increased
creatinine and BUN. Multiple boluses were adminsitered. On HD
26, urine output noted to have decreased to less than 15/hr.
Oxygen level had diminshed to 88% on room air and was placed on
a fask mask with which he had sats of 93%. Pt transferred to the
unit. Continued decline in respiration and patient foudn to be
acidotic as per ABG. Pt intubated and NGT placed. Renal team
spoken with and dialysis begun.   As the hospitalization
progressed, his overall status began to improve.
Neurologically, all hiss sedation was minimized.  We were able
to wean all of his pressor support.  In terms of the ventilator,
he was weaned to nasal cannula gradually.  Tube feeds were
initiated via a g-tube(placed [**3-16**]) and advanced to goal rate
with good urine output.  He finished a course of meropenum for
enterobacter in the blood. The patient was being screened for
rehab when on the morning of [**3-26**], he acutly went into
