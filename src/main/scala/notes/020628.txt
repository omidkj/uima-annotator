History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23372**] is a 51 year old male with history of recent
trauma resulting in C3-C5 cord contusion and quadraplegia who
presents with increasing O2 requirement at rehab.
.
The patient was recently admitted from [**11-3**] to [**11-17**] with a
complicated course.  Prior to the admission, the patient was
reportedly driving with onset of chest pain, SOB, and abdominal
pain.  There is a question of whether he lost consciousness, and
then he crashed into a fire engine.  He suffered multiple
injuries including C3-C5 spinal cord contusion, teardrop fx at
C3, injury to ALL, multiple L periprosthesis femur fx, R [**4-3**]
anterolateral rib fractures, and grade II liver lac.  The
patient was hypotensive and bradycardic upon admission,
consistent with neurogenic shock. He was aggressively fluid
resuscitated and maintained on neo initially, before switching
to midodrine PO.  He was evaluated by neurosurgery and found to
be a non-operative candidate and the decision was made to keep
him in a [**Location (un) 2848**] J c-spine collar at least 6 weeks at which point
an MRI will be repeated. Although a CT angiogram of the chest
was negative for PE at the time of admission (pt was 2 weeks
postop from a Lt distal femur fracture repair and suspicion of
pulmonary embolism as mechanism of presenting chest pain, SOB
was highly suspected at time of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]), a CXR on
[**11-4**] showed evidence of PE/infarction of the Lt lower lobe. An
IVC filter was placed on [**11-5**] to prevent further PE in a
quadriplegic patient with traumatic contraindications for
anticoagulation.  He also underwent ORIF of Lt femur fracture on
[**2138-11-5**].  He was unable to be extubated due to easy fatigue and
so received trach/PEG on [**11-6**].  The patient was intermittently
febrile throughout his hospital course, as high as 103 on
multiple occasions. No sources of infection were found: sputum,
BAL, urine, blood, indwelling catheters, pressure ulcers, sinus
infections, wound infections, etc. His Rt common femoral DVT was
to be the only possible source of his intermittent fevers. He
was twice started on empiric antibiotics after spiking
temperatures but these were discontinued after negative
microbiology results.  Regarding the DVT, in addition to IVC
filter placement, he was also started on lovenox and coumadin.
Despite high dose coumadin (20mg daily) he remained
subtherapeutic and was discharged on lovenox and coumadin
pending therapeutic INR.  Per notes, he gradually regained the
ability to move his toes ([**3-2**]), ankles ([**1-30**]), and knees ([**1-2**]),
as well as use some grasp function of his hands bilaterally,
although his exam waxed and waned.  He was afebrile for several
days prior to discharge.
.
This morning he was noted to desat at rehab with increased O2
requirements from FiO2 30--> 50%.  His ABG at that time on FiO2
of 55% was 7.51/38/56.  He reports shortness of breath and
subjective fevers.  No cough.
.
In the emergency department, his initial vitals were T 98.4, BP
101/53, HR 72, RR 20, O2 sat 99% (unclear what initial vent
settings were on presentation).  On exam, he was alert and
oriented x 3, satting 97% on AC 550/16, PEEP 10, Fi02 60%.
Mucous membranes were significantly dry, lung exam with good air
movement throughout but diffuse coarse rhonchi.  CXR showed
bilateral pleural effusions, however the ED was concerned about
possible patchy infiltrates.  EKG unchanged.  No signs of volume
overload.  Poor urine output.  Was given 1.7L IVF.  WBC noted to
increase from 6 to 11.  He was given vanco, cefepime, and levo,
as well as tamiflu.  Also received ativan 0.5mg IV x 1. Flu swab
was sent (?).  Blood cx x 3 sent.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for further management.

IMAGING:
ADMISSION CXR: Acute moderate pulmonary edema with bibasilar
compressive
atelectasis. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions,
greater on the left.
.
CHEST CT:
1. Findings consistent with multifocal infection, accompanied by
small
pleural effusions.
2. Increased number of mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive.

3. Nondisplaced rib fractures and C7 nondisplaced spinous
process fracture.
4. Mild splenomegaly.
.
TTE:The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60-70%). Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CT AB/PELVIS: 1. No explanation for source of fevers.
2. Resolving hemoperitoneum with no evidence of visceral injury.

3. Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
MRI C, T, L SPINE:  1. Interval evolution of the cord contusion
extending from C3-C5 into cystic myelomalacia.
2. Stable severe spinal canal stenosis from C3-4 through C4-5
and moderate
spinal canal stenosis at C5-6. Stable variable multilevel
multifactorial
neural foraminal narrowing as described above.
3. Probable tarlov or synovial cyst abutting the left L4-5 facet
joint.
Lateral meningocele is less likely.
4. Bilateral pleu
