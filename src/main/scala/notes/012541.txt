HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 33-year-old,
gravida 3, para 1, who was noted to have an elevated AFP on
[**2173-1-17**].  On [**2-5**], the patient presented for a
level II ultrasound and was found to an intrauterine fetal
demise at 20 weeks.  Options were discussed with the patient,
and she elected to undergo D&E.  Laminaria were placed on
[**2-9**], and the patient underwent D&E on [**2-10**].
Please see the details of the procedure in the dictated
operative report.

PAST OB HISTORY:  In [**2171**] the patient had a cesarean section
at 34 weeks secondary to oligohydramnios and breech
presentation.  She had SAB times one in [**2172**].  The patient
has a history of anti-C and anti-......... antibody.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  She is status post total hip
replacement secondary to congenital hip abnormality.  2.
Status post appendectomy.  3.  Uterine fibroids.

ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Normal.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation.  Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:
Gravid consistent with 20-week gestation.  Extremities:
Nontender.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  D&E:  The patient underwent a dilation
and evacuation under ultrasound guidance.  The estimated
blood loss was approximately 800 cc.  She received 10 U of
intracervical Pitocin, as well as 20 U of Pitocin and 1 L LR
IV, as well as 250 mg Hemabate IM during the procedure.  At
the conclusion of the case, ultrasound confirmed that there
was no uterine contents remaining.

Around 6 p.m., the patient had passage of a moderate amount
of clots, approximately 250 cc.  There was clot evacuated
from the lower uterine segment, and 1000 mcg Cytotec was
placed rectally.  She was also given Methergine at the time.
Reevaluation approximately 2 hours later revealed that the
patient continued to have heavy bleeding.  On exam, she was
afebrile with a blood pressure of 120/80 and a heart rate
ranging from 80 to 110.  A Foley was placed into the bladder
and returned 100 cc.  The fundus was firm, and again there
were clots in the lower uterine segment.  Approximately an
additional 500 cc of blood was noted coming from the vagina.

Labs were sent a revealed a hematocrit of 22.3, platelet
count 159, INR 1.3, fibrinogen 187.  The patient was given 2
[**Location 16678**], typed and crossed for 2 U of packed red blood
cells, and consented for reevaluation in the Operating Room.

The etiology for her bleeding and now DIC was thought to be
either secondary to ................ versus laceration versus
dilutional coagulopathy versus retained products.

In the Operating Room, the patient was noted to have a small
cervical laceration, as well as a laceration in the posterior
fornix.  She also had a small amount of retained tissue.  The
lacerations were repaired, and a sharp and suction curettage
were performed.  Intraoperatively the patient received a
total of 4 U of packed red blood cells and 3 [**Location 16678**].  Her
estimated blood loss total including the previous procedure
and the time interval between procedures was close to 2 L.

Intraoperatively her hematocrit ............. at 18 and the
fibrinogen ............... at 98.  Her INR was 1.4.
Postoperatively the patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for further management.

2.  Hematology:  Over the hospital course, the patient
received a total of 7 U of packed red blood cells and 4 [**Location 31319**].  By postoperative day #1, status post her return to the
OR, her DIC had improved with fibrinogen returning to above
200.  Her platelets were stable in the 90s.  Over the course
of the hospital stay, her hematocrit also stabilized at 26.

3.  Pulmonary:  Immediately postoperatively the patient
remained intubated and was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit.  She was weaned off the vent on the evening of [**2-11**].  By discharge, the patient had an oxygen saturation of
100% on room air.

4.  Cardiovascular:  Immediately postoperatively, the patient
had some episodes of hypotension which required pressor
support.  By the end of postoperative day #0, the patient was
off all pressor support.

5.  Infectious disease:  The patient had some elevated
temperatures as high as 101.6?????? on postoperative day #0 and
#1.  She was placed on triple antibiotics with Ampicillin,
Gentamicin, and Clindamycin.  By postoperative day #3, her
fevers had defervesced, and she was transitioned to p.o.
antibiotics on hospital day #4.

6.  Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Once the patient was
extubated, her diet was advanced as tolerated.  Her urine
output was excellent throughout the hospitalization.  Her
electrolytes were normal overall and were repleted as needed.

7.  GYN:  From a GYN standpoint, her bleeding postoperatively
was minimal.  She was continued on Pitocin for approximately
18 hours and continued on Methergine for 24 hours.  Her
bleeding remained minimal throughout her hospitalization.

8.  Prophylaxis:  While the patient was in the Intensive Care
Unit, she was maintained on Protonix for GI prophylaxis and
Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.

9.  Endocrine:  Due to her hypotensives episodes, there was
concern for pituitary versus adrenal insufficiency.  A random
cortisol was drawn and was low at 3.9.  The patient
subsequently underwent a cortisol stimulation test which was
normal.  She then had a morning cortisol drawn which was at
the lower end of normal at 12.  She was evaluated by
Endocrine who felt that at this time the patient did not have
any evidence of pituitary insufficiency; however, they
recommended a follow-up in [**6-12**] weeks to reassess.

10.  TORCH titers:  TORCH titers were sent.  As of this time,
the CMV, IgG, and toxo-IgG were both positive suggestive of
prior exposure.  Toxo-IgM and CMV IgM are pending, as well as
her P-simplex.

11.  Psychiatry:  During her stay, the patient was evaluated
by social worker who had concern that the patient had
suicidal ideation.  A psychiatry consult was called, and the
patient was evaluated.  Psychiatry felt that the patient was
safe for discharge and would not harm herself or her
20-month-old baby.  She will follow-up with social work in
several days.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged home on
postoperative day #5.  She was given a prescription to finish
a 5-day course of Doxycycline.  She will follow-up with both
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2491**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Intrauterine fetal demise at 20 weeks.
2.  Status post dilatation and evacuation.
3.  Status post exam under anesthesia and repair of cervical
laceration.
4.  DIC.
5.  Postoperative fever.
6.  Rule out pituitary and adrenal insufficiency.
7.  Adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 5
days, Percocet [**1-6**] tab p.o. q.3-4 hours.
