Service:  C-MEDICINE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old gentleman
with known coronary artery disease, ischemic/alcoholic
cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
peripheral vascular disease, admitted to outside hospital
with chest pain and shortness of breath; transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for catheterization.

The patient admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital on [**2134-12-20**],
with respiratory failure and severe congestive heart failure;
had presented with three days of chest pain and shortness of
breath.  The patient intubated and aggressively diuresed.
Extubated on [**2134-12-21**].  CKs were flat at 25, 29 and 32,
however, troponin elevated at 1.4, 1.3 and 0.8, and MB
percentage elevated at 9.6, 12.1 and 9.4.  The patient on
transfer continued to have on and off chest pain, which was
one out of ten on transfer despite intravenous Nitroglycerin,
intravenous Heparin and a Morphine and gastrointestinal
cocktail.  The patient describes his chest pain over the past
one week as nonradiating and associated with shortness of
breath, diaphoresis and alleviated with Nitroglycerin and
MDIs.

The patient was noted by the outside hospital to have some
"rapid rhythm" while he was intubated and there was some
question of atrial fibrillation.

The patient has had a decreased hematocrit of 27 to 30 at the
outside hospital and is guaiac positive on [**2134-12-21**].  The
patient has apparently had a gastrointestinal workup in the
past which was supposedly negative from below (question of a
flexible sigmoidoscopy versus colonoscopy in the past), and
was due to have an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

The patient had a Persantine Cardiolite on [**2134-12-1**], at the
outside hospital.  No angina noted.  Electrocardiogram was
uninterpretable secondary to ventricular pacing, and a large
inferoapical and small anteroseptal defects with some
reperfusion were noted.

The patient had an echocardiogram in 12/00, at [**Hospital1 346**] demonstrating a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 15%, severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis, akinetic apex, mild concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy, severely dilated left ventricle, and moderately
dilated left atrium and right atrium.  Mild aortic
insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation were also
noted at that time.

The patient also had an ETT Thallium in 12/00, which noted a
fixed apical perfusion defect and moderate fixed inferior
wall perfusion defect.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure.  Ejection fraction of 15%.
2.  Ischemic/question of alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of about 20% with global hypokinesis.
3.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Amiodarone discontinued for unclear reasons on [**2134-12-18**],
question of blurred vision.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe, with two
liter oxygen dependency at home.
5.  Severe peripheral vascular disease, status post right and
left femoral popliteal bypass performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].
6.  Laryngeal cancer, status post radiation therapy.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease, status post dilation and
reconstructive surgery of esophagus, also secondary to
laryngeal cancer.
8.  Anemia.
9.  Guaiac positive stools.
10. Coronary artery disease, status post catheterization in
02/99, and studies stated above.
11. Sick sinus syndrome, status post [**Company 1543**] pacemaker
placement in 01/99,
12. Hypothyroidism.
13. History of wide complex tachycardia.

ALLERGIES:  Percocet.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with lady friend in
[**Name (NI) **], [**State 350**] on [**Name (NI) 22637**] Island.  He is a retired horse
trainer.  He quit tobacco one week ago.  He smoked five packs
per day for sixty years.  He quit alcohol six months ago and
was a heavy drinker prior to this.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 94.5, blood
pressure 120/68, heart rate 77, oxygen saturation 93% on
three liters.  In general, this is a thin elderly male with
mild respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
- mucous membranes are moist.  The oropharynx is benign.  The
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Neck
revealed no jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.
Heart normal sinus rhythm, S1 and S2, II/VI systolic murmur
at the apex, blowing and radiating to the axilla.  The lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally with slight bibasilar
rales.  The abdomen is soft, tender to palpation in the right
periumbilical region.  Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  Nonpalpable dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurologically,
the patient is alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  Notable laboratories on admission from
outside hospital included hematocrit 29.1, partial
thromboplastin time 36.0, prothrombin time 17.6, INR 2.1.
Calcium 8.6 and CK 28.

Electrocardiogram from outside hospital - paced, left bundle
branch block pattern.

Chest x-ray from outside hospital positive for cardiomegaly,
pacemaker with dual pacing wires, positive pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - The patient planned to have
catheterization in the morning after transfer, however,
overnight the patient had an episode of respiratory distress
requiring intubation and transfer to PCU.  Etiology felt to
be possibly secondary to agitation secondary to
administration of Ambien with subsequent tachycardia and
worsening congestive heart failure.

Contributing factors also include respiratory distress from
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute ischemia.
The patient's diuresed in Intensive Care Unit with good
response and the patient subsequently gestured in the CCU to
have his tube pulled out and once this done tolerated the
extubation quite well.

Discussion ensued between the patient, the patient's
girlfriend and the CCU staff and the patient's code status
was changed to DNR/DNI.  The patient expressed firmly his
desire to be made comfort measures only at this point.  He
clearly and coherently expressed his desire for comfort
oriented care and his code status was changed to DNR/DNI.

At this point, no further aggressive measures were taken and
it was decided to treat the patient's coronary artery
disease/ischemia with medical management.  His medications
were titrated up as tolerated.  No catheterization.

Pump - The patient had repeat echocardiogram on [**2134-12-23**],
that demonstrated an ejection fraction of less than 15% and
akinesis of the apical left ventricular walls and severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis, and severe 4+ mitral
regurgitation.  Also noted were 1+ aortic regurgitation and
2+ tricuspid regurgitation.  There was moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Compared to prior
echocardiogram of 12/00, the left ventricular function was
further decreased and the severity of the mitral
regurgitation was increased as well as the pulmonary
pressure.  As before, no aggressive measures were taken and
the patient's medications were titrated up.  Nitrates were
begun to decrease afterload and the patient tolerated these
medications well with no further episodes of chest pain or
pulmonary edema.

Rhythm - The patient with a history of atrial fibrillat
