History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Mrs. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 54yo Hispanic F
with CAD s/p STEMI in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year with placement of BMS to
D1, HIV on HAART, bipolar disorder who was BIBA after
complaining of worsening CP and SOB. She reports that going back
for her PCI in [**Month (only) 205**], she never felt quite back to her normal
self after the stent was placed, with continued DOE and easily
fatigable. She says that for the last two months or so, she has
noted progressive central CP a/w SOB, nausea, and diaphoresis.
These episodes are almost always brought on by exertion, not
related to meals or deep breaths. No relief with sitting
forward. She did not try any medications at home to relieve the
pain, and it became unbearable on AM of admission. She called
for an ambulance. She received ASA 325mg x1 en route to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for presence of chest pain
dyspnea on exertion, and presyncope and for absence of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, or syncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7 76 107/71 18 98%. She was
found to have ST depressions in V4-V5 and troponin of 0.27. She
was started on nitro and heparin gtt, loaded with Plavix 600mg,
and also Percocet 5/325 x1, all with minimal relief of pain. She
was taken emergently to the cath lab which revealed in-stent
restenosis of D1 involving the proximal LAD. Cardiac surgery was
consulted in the cath lab and the decision was made that she
should proceed to CABG as soon as possible. An IABP was placed
at that time given her continued CP post-procedure. SHe was
transferred to the CVICU for further monitoring with plan for
CABG in the AM.

ECHO
Prebypass
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesia of the apex, apical and mid portions of the anterior
and anteroseptal walls. . Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results on [**2140-12-29**] at 1000am.
Post bypass
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylepehrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Mitral
regurgitation is 1- 2+. Aorta is intact post decannulation. .
