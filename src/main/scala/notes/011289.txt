Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-4-26**] - Redo Sternotomy, AVR (19mm Onyx mechanical valve)

History of Present Illness:
This is a 32-year-old patient who has had a prior homograft
replacement of the aortic root for aortic stenosis, presented at
this time with severe aortic stenosis confirmed by echo with
symptoms. He was electively admitted for redo sternotomy and
replacement of the aortic valve and possibly root replacement.

- h/o atrial flutter, status post cardioversion
- h/o subarachnoid bleed in the right parietal temporal
region secondary to Lovenox; w/u in progress for platelet
dysfunction
- s/p appendectomy in [**2140**]
- hernia repair in [**2156**]

Social History:
He is married, with three children. Owns a restaurant in [**Location (un) 246**],
cooks there. Social ETOH, quit smoking several months ago,
previous pack per
day for 12-years.

Family History:
-mother with diabetes
-father is healthy
-no strokes in family
-no h/o premature CAD/sudden cardiac death

Physical Exam:
98.7, 101/60, 81, 22, 97/RA, 128.3 KG
Gen: comfortable, no distress
HEENT: no LAD, MMM, PERLA, no OP lesions
Neck: thick, no JVD appreciable
Heart: S1/S2, RRR, 3/6 SEM best heard at RUSB
Abd: obese, soft/NT
EXT: no edema, 2+ pulses
Neuro: AOx3, no focal deficits

Pertinent Results:
[**2163-4-26**] ECHOPRE-BYPASS: 1. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. 2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
globally. 3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis, more toward the middle and apical free wall. 4.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic valve
appears to be a homograft. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets
are thickened. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected
for this type of prosthesis. A mass is present on the aortic
valve, consistent with possible endocarditis. No obvious abscess
cavities seen . There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass
study, the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including
norepinephrine and vasopressin. 1. Biventricular systolic
function slightly improved. 2. Mechanical valve seen in the
aortic position. Trace to mild central aortic insufficiency
present. However views of the prosthetic aortic valve are
limited and poor. Mean gradient across the valve was 20 mm Hg.
3. Trace mitral insufifciency present.
[**2163-5-5**] CXR: Comparison with the previous study done [**2163-5-2**].
There is interval improvement in minimal left basilar
atelectasis. The lungs appear otherwise clear. No pleural
effusion is identified. The heart appears enlarged, as before.
The patient is status post median sternotomy. Mediastinal
structures are unchanged. The bony thorax is grossly intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32894**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2163-4-26**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent a redo sternotomy with an
aortic valve replacement using a 19mm onyx valve. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the
cardiac intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next 24
hours, Mr. [**Known lastname 32894**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was
extubated. He was noted to be in a junctional rhythm which
occasionally alternated with sinus rhythm. The electrophysiology
service was consulted who recommended holding his amiodarone and
Lopressor until sinus rhythm returns. It was also recommended
that he be pancultured in the event that he becomes febrile as
an infectious cause could be the cause of his rhythm
disturbance. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation for his
mechanical valve. On postoperative day two, Mr. [**Known lastname 32894**] was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility.
Mr. [**Known lastname 32894**] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on postoperative day eleven. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**], his cardiologist and primary care physician
as an outpatient. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58**] will follow his Coumadin and
Target INR is 2.0-3.0.
