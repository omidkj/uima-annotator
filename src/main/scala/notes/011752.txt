have pulseless left foot.  Patient reports falling one week ago
on both knees after feeling uneasy on his feet.  He has had
increasing LLE pain since then, from his thigh down.  This has
been associated with numbness and inability to move his foot.
He has been unable to ambulate.  He has had some issues with
dizziness and confusion over the past week, and at times has
forgotten the date.  His daughter was concerned so brought him
to an OSH ED where he was found to have no pulses in his left
foot with mottling.  He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
evaluation
and vascular surgery was consulted.  Patient denies fevers,
chills, nausea, emesis.  He has had some diarrhea.  Of note, he
has been self-treating his chronic non-healing ulceration of his

Pertinent Results:
CT LLE [**2118-3-2**]:

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service for
emergent left femoral and popliteal cutdown and thrombectomy for
acute ischmia. He was also noted to have a significant
cellulitis of the left lower extremity upon admission. He
tolerated the procedure well. Please see the operative report
for further details. During the case he was anticoagulated with
heparin, but his PTT did not appropriately increase. He was
switched to Argatroban drip due to his resistance to heparin. He
was transferred to the ICU intubated where his left lower
extremity was monitored closely for signs of compartment
syndrome. He was started on broad spectrum IV antibiotics for
his cellulitis. A wound culture was taken that eventually grew
coagulase negative staphylococcus. He remained intubated until
his compartments remained soft for >6 hours and a CT scan of his
left lower extremity was negative for a deep leg infection. He
was weaned off the ventilator and extubated uneventfully. His
left leg was improved and he was transferred to the floor. The
patient's home medications were restarted. The remainder of the
post-operative course was uncomplicated as follows:
.
Neuro: Pain was controlled with IV medications while NPO and was

transitioned to PO pain medications when tolerating a diet. The
patient takes methadone for chronic back pain and was continued
on this once he was tolerating po.
.
CV: Patient was monitored closely. He was given metoprolol IV
and po to maintain his blood pressure within goal. He will be
continued on this increased dose as an outpatient. The patient
was maintained on other home cardiovascular medications.  He may
restart his lisinopril upon return to rehab, but this may
require further titration of his metoprolol dose.
.
Pulm: Patient maintained normal O2 saturations and was
encouraged to use incentive spirometry frequently.

GI: Patient was initially NPO. His diet was advanced when
appropriate and he tolerated it without nausea or vomiting.

Renal: Patient was voiding independently without any issues. He
was given IV lasix for diuresis as necessary and responded
appropriately.
.
Endo: The patient was continued on his home insulin regimen.
While his po intake was poor his lantus dose was decreased to
half of the original value.
.
Heme: The patient's argatroban drip was continued with a goal
PTT of 60-80. Coumadin was started and the argatroban was turned
off on [**3-24**] and his INR was 4.1. His coumadin was held and
decreased to 2.5 the next day. His coumadin was resumed and will
be further managed at rehab.
.
ID: Patient received IV antibiotics for presumed cellulitis. He
was continued on these during this hospitalization and will
complete a 14 day course of outpatient IV antibiotics due to the
severity of his left lower extremity cellulitis.  On the day of
discharge, his vanco trough returned 23.8, and his dose was
reduced to 750 mg [**Hospital1 **].  This will require reassessment and
possibly retitration after 3 doses.
.
PPX: argatroban, coumadin, aspirin
.
Physical therapy worked with the patient and recommended
discharge to rehab. The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]
in clinic for further evaluation and staple/suture removal in 2
weeks.
