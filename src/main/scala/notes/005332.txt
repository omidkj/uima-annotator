[**2179-11-23**] Liver, gallbladder US: 1. Patent posterior TIPS with
wall-to-wall flow. Velocities in the proximal and mid TIPS have
decreased compared to prior. Apparent interval increase in
velocity in the posterior TIPS may be secondary to turbulence.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 56 yo M with h/o EtOH cirrhosis s/p TIPS with multiple
revisions here with confusion/ agitation.
.
1. Confusion: Likely [**3-13**] Hepatic Encephalopathy as pt's relative
reports he is non-compliant with lactulose at home. The relative
also reports pt has been drinking ETOH at home although tox
screens in ED were negative. He was admitted and started on
lactulose however [**3-13**] agitation and non-compliance he had to be
given lactulose via enema. On the afternoon of [**11-22**], he became
briefly unresponsive on the floor. He continued to protect his
airway during this episode and woke up as ABG was being drawn
however he was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. On
the morning of [**11-23**] he was transferred back to the floor with
an NGT in place through which he was recieving lactulose.  With
this, he slowly began to clear over the next several days and
his lactulose was gradually tapered to 30 ml QID at the time of
discharge.
   Pt has a  h/o DT with persistently elevated CIWA during the
first 4 days of this admission. Thus, withdrawl was also likely
contributing to some confusion as could benzos used to treat
withdrwal.
   Pt's TIPS was initially unable to be fully assessed [**3-13**] pt's
inability to comply with exam. However, US on [**11-23**] showed the
posterior TIPS to be patent.
   Finally, infection could have been a contributer to the pt's
confusion. He had a temp to 103 reportedly in ED and was put on
Ceftriaxone for presumptive SBP.  However, SBP seemed unlikely
as pt had never c/o abd pain, spiked another fever, and had
limited ascites.  Fever in ED could have been [**3-13**] agitation,
EtOH withdrawl and/or acute alcoholic hepatitis. Thus,
Cefriaxone was discontinued on [**11-23**]. However, fever recurred on
[**11-25**] and [**11-26**]. Blood and urine cultures were ordered and
negative. There was thought to be too little ascitic fluid to
tap. CXR showed likely aspiration PNA and the pt was put on
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin. This was changed to PO
Levofloxacin for a planned 4 more days of antibiotic treatment
at discharge.
  Of note, on [**2179-11-27**] the pt was sufficiently cleared to insist
that he be discharged and state that he would not stay in the
hospital for further treatment. He was discharged home on
Levofloxacin, Lactulose and Rifaximin.
.
2. EtOH Cirrhosis s/p TIPS: MELD on admission 22. LFT's all incr
at admission stabilized by discharge with T bili down to 8.8 on
[**11-27**]. Lasix and spironolactone were held [**3-13**] hypernatremia
early in the admission. Spironolactone was restarted prior to
discharge but lasix was not as pt was still having tenuous BP.
He should follow up with his PCP to restart this. Continued home
MVI, thiamine, folic acid, nadolol and omeprazole.
.
3. DM type [**Name (NI) **] Pt non-compliant with Insulin per relative's
report at home. He wa
