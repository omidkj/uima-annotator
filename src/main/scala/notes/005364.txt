none


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 74 yo F w/ CHF EF 20-25%, DM, PVD s/p recent R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **]
[**4-/2127**] c/b groin wound infection s/p debridement and vancomycin
and Aztreonam course, and recent onset c/o SOB, increasing pedal
edema, nonproductive cough X 1 week.
She noted persistent chest pain/pressure triggered by coughing
and heavy breathing. At the time, she was experiencing
subjective chills. No sick contacts, URI sx, fevers, chronic
foley, no back tenderness. The patient also c/o
nausea/nonbloody, nonbilious emesis, abdominal pain X 4 days. No
hematemesis, hematochezia, melena.
.
In ED, the patient presented with rales and BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 4731**]. She was
diuresed 1L with 40 mg IV lasix, with SBP dropping to 50s-60s
transiently and recovering to 100s spontaneously. A central line
was placed during the hypotensive episode with CVP measured at
15. She was started on Ciprofloxacin for UA. Abdominal CT showed
no inflammation or abscess as source of infection, improved
ascites and bilateral pleural effusions. She was admitted for
further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo with CHF, PVD, CAD, hx of MRSA indwelling foley, s/p
recent aorto-fem [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass c/b wound infection admitted with
SOB likely [**1-10**] to CHF exacerbation with course c/b
self-resolving hypotension following diuresis continued on
diuresis on admission. SOB [**1-10**] decompensated CHF given CXR
showing worsening effusion and edema. Unclear trigger for this
event. A new ECHO performed as an inpatient revealed inferior
hypokinesis suggestive of a recent MI of unknown date (EF of
20-25%) but negative troponins and negative ECG on admission.
Infection was a less likely trigger given the absence of
leukocytosis and hx of aztreonam and vancomycin prior to
admission. UCx and wound cultures were negative, though the
patient presented with thick secretions. PNA was an unlikely
trigger given a stable CXR with improving pleural effusions,
absence of fever/leukocytosis on aztreonam/vancomycin. PE less
likely given anticoagulation with lovenox at rehab and absence
of supportive hx. No hx of dietary indiscretion or medical
noncompliance.
.
On [**2126-7-3**], while actively being diuresed (on a lasix drip with
metolazone), the patient had episode of hypotension and
unresponsiveness (a code was called). The patient was
subsequently transferred to the MICU. This was thought likely to
be cause by a combination of hypotension, slight bradycardia and
medications administered prior to the code (zofran and
morphine). Also of note, the systolic blood pressures in her
right arm are 30-40 mmHg lower than her left arm (likely [**1-10**]
subclavian artery stenosis on right). Patient had an episode of
vomiting and likely aspirated based on the chest x-ray finding
of likley aspiration PNA. Patient had persistent hypotension
after the code and the patient was started on dopamine.  Patient
was slowly weaned off, but cause of hypotension is not
completely clear though it was thought likely secondary to both
hypovolemia and p
