Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted after presentation to an OSH the week
before with similar complaints. CT scan from OSH was obtained
and KUB was obtained here, both of which were consistent with a
cecal volvulus. Pt was taken to the OR on [**2165-5-22**] for an ex-lap
and a hemicolectomy was performed to relieve her volvulus. On
[**2165-5-23**] the patient began to have O2 sats in the upper 80's on
3LO2 and was sent for a CT to rule out a PE. The CT was negative
for a PE but showed increased consolidation in the lungs. The
patient was transferred to the SICU due to respiratory distress
and started on ABx for presumed pneumonia. On [**2165-5-24**] the
patient stabilized anf was transferred back to the floor. She
failed her initial speecha and swallow examination, but a repeat
video swallow study on [**2165-5-27**] indicated that the patient would
be able to take pureed foods and thin liquids. The patient has
continued to improve and is discharged in good condition on
levaquin and on the recommended diet per speech and swallow back
to her group home.

Discharge Instructions:
Call or return to ER for fever >101.5, increased redness,

1. PO diet of thin liquids and pureed consistency solids with
full assistance for feeding during meals.

2. Please give liquids by cup only - NO STRAWS!! When giving
liquids, allow the pt to help hold the cup (will take time to
position her hands around the cup) as this allows her to control

the timing and the size of the sip to reduce the risk for
aspiration.

3. When giving purees, the feeder will need to "scrape" the
purees from the spoon onto her palate, as the pt cannot take the

food off the spoon independently.

by
