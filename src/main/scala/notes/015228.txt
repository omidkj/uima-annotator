continued to be clear, no acute pulmonary process.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2194-4-16**], the patient was waiting
for the donor, but the donor's organ was not acceptable for
this patient. The patient was discharged on [**2194-4-16**]. The
patient did return on [**2194-4-17**] for potential transplant.
Compared to [**2194-4-16**], there was no change in his physical
exam, no fevers, no chills, no abdominal pain, no swelling to
lower extremities, no cough, no chest pain. The patient went
to surgery on [**2194-4-17**] for pancreas transplant, Y-graft
to left lower quadrant, and bowel anastomosis performed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Doctor Last Name **]. There were no complications. The
patient was stable and went to recovery room. Please see
detailed documentation of the operative note in the computer.

The patient went to the regular floor postoperatively. The
patient was placed on thymo, MMF and FK. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted
on [**2194-4-18**] for blood sugar control and had continued to
follow him while he was a patient in the hospital. The
patient continued on FK, ATG, MMF, Simulect. Blood sugars
have decreased significantly. The patient had an NG tube
placed. The patient was n.p.o., taking meds p.o., and
clamping NG tube. The patient had a JP drain in place which
was draining sanguineous fluids. Labs have been stable. The
patient was placed on a PCA postoperatively for pain control.
Foley was removed on [**2194-4-20**].

On [**2194-4-21**], the patient had an acute hematocrit drop. On
[**4-19**], hematocrit was 31 and this slowly decreased to 29, to
28, to 26 that day. So, it was decided to get a CT abdomen
with IV contrast, as well as a CT pelvis. The findings
demonstrated that there was nothing to explain the
significant hematocrit drop. Postoperative changes around the
new pancreas and bowel anastomosis. Findings were discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

The patient continued to do well with this blood sugars. PCA
was discontinued. Postoperatively, the patient had
atelectasis bilaterally, but no signs of acute infiltrate
from a chest x-ray that was done on [**2194-4-27**]. The
patient's hematocrit continued to drop requiring packed red
blood cell transfusions and FFP for an INR of 4.9 on [**2194-4-29**]. The patient continued to have JP intact, but has had
bloody output from drain. PT and OT were consulted. He
continued to be afebrile. Vital signs stable.

On [**2194-5-1**], the patient was brought to the OR for
abdominal washout with removal of pancreatic hematoma. The
old incision was opened, and a significant amount of old
blood and hematoma were present. Please see OR note for
detailed information about the procedure that was done on [**2194-5-1**]. On [**2194-5-1**], labs were the following: WBC 13.8,
hematocrit 32.3, platelets 353, PT 13.8, PTT 33.8, INR 1.3.

The patient continued to be on tacrolimus and rapamycin
during this hospitalization. On [**2194-5-6**], the patient had
a CT abdomen status post washout and complained of abdominal
pain, diarrhea and elevated white blood cell count. CT
abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no evidence of small bowel
obstruction, or drainable fluid collection abdomen; interval
slight increase in amount of free fluid in the abdomen and
pleural effusions after abdominal irrigation. The patient had
2 JP drains, as well as 2 JP drains after the washout
surgery. The patient continued to need intermittent
transfusions for a low hematocrit. The patient was restarted
on aspirin and Plavix. The patient continued to see physical
therapy and occupational therapy.

On [**2194-5-7**], the patient had PICC line placement for
parenteral nutrition. On [**2194-5-8**], the patient had a
lower extremity ultrasound, for right lower extremity edema,
demonstrating no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Throughout his hospitalization, the patient has been making
good urine output. The patient had a low-grade temperature on
[**2194-5-9**] with diarrhea and was cultured for that
temperature. A swab culture that was finalized demonstrated
that there was staph coag-negative. All of his multiple stool
cultures have been sent-off which have been unremarkable, no
growth, no fungus, no microbacteria. On [**2194-5-12**], the
patient had a Dobbhoff tube placed under fluoroscopy. TPN was
switched to tube feeds, and the reason behind that was that
the diarrhea may be due to the actual TPN.

On [**2194-5-12**] around 5 o'clock in the evening, the patient
had dyspn
