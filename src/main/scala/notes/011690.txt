Admission Date:  [**2164-8-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-9-3**]

Date of Birth:   [**2104-5-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-MEDIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient was transferred
from the Cardiac Care Unit on [**2164-7-25**].  For a
description of the events taken place in the Cardiac Care
Unit, please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 101113**] discharge note for the Cardiac
Care Unit.

Briefly, the patient is a 68 year old female with a history
of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy diagnosed by echocardiogram in
the year [**2162**], who broke her left hip on [**2164-8-4**], and
was admitted to the Orthopedic Service for open reduction and
internal fixation.  However, prior to sickle cell, the
patient experienced shortness of breath secondary to
congestive heart failure and was transferred to the [**Hospital6 22258**] where she was aggressively diuresed with
Lasix.  She experienced worsening respiratory distress.
Cardiology advised a blood transfusion and aggressive
administration of negative inotropics (Lopressor 100 four
times a day and Verapamil 80 three times a day currently),
and close monitoring of intervascular volume (goal euvolemic)
in order to minimize the patient's outflow tract gradient.
She was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit on
[**8-8**], where she was intubated for respiratory
decompensation and underwent open reduction and internal
fixation of the left hip on [**8-9**], which required 11 units
of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh frozen plasma,
and 2 units of plasma.

During her stay in the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient's main
issues have included the following:  1) Aggressive use of
negative inotropics and close maintenance of euvolemic to
minimize outflow tract gradient; 2) prolonged ventilation
with extubation [**8-22**]; 3) brief oliguria secondary to ATN
following surgery, now resolved; 4) prolonged high-grade
fevers to 103.0 F./104.0 F., thought to be secondary to
Zyprexa induced NMS, then C. difficile infection; 5)
persistent obtunded state secondary to toxic metabolic
encephalopathy.

echocardiogram in [**2162**].
2.  Hypertension.

12. Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon arrival, the patient was afebrile
with a temperature of 97.2 F.; pulse of 88; blood pressure of
128/72; tachypneic at a rate of 36, saturation of 98% by 40%
face mask.  In general, this is an obtunded female laying in
bed, with very shallow rapid breathing.  Her pupils were
equal, round and reactive to light.  Her eyes were anicteric.
Oropharynx is benign.  Anterior lung fields were clear
bilaterally.   Her heart was regular rate and rhythm.  III/VI
harsh systolic murmur best heard at the apex.  Her abdomen
was soft, obese, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel
sounds with no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities
were cool and dry with one plus distal pulses bilaterally; no
edema.  Foley catheter and rectal bag were in place.  Left
inguinal incision was clean, dry and intact.  She
intermittently answered the questions, acknowledged the
presence of visitors.  She would track movements in the room
but otherwise was very unresponsive.

LABORATORY:  She had a white blood cell count of 8.6,
hematocrit of 28.4, platelet count of 439.  Coags were a PT
of 13.5, PTT of 25.6 and an INR of 1.3.  Chem-10 included the
sodium of 142, potassium 3.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 31,
BUN of 21, creatinine 0.6, glucose of 127.  Calcium 9.1,
phosphorus 3.3, magnesium 2.2.

STUDIES:  Echocardiogram on [**8-14**] showed elongated left
atrium, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy,
severe resting left ventricular outflow tract, normal right
ventricular size and wall motion, three plus mitral
regurgitation (increased compared to [**8-6**] study),
ejection fraction of 70%.

She was Clostridium difficile positive on [**8-16**].

Chest x-ray on [**8-21**] which showed a new left lower lobe
consolidation consistent with either pneumonia or
atelectasis.

LENI's performed on [**8-20**] were negative for deep venous
thrombosis.

CT scan of the abdomen / pelvis on [**8-16**], which showed
post-traumatic changes around the left pelvic fracture.
There were no signs of abscess.  Overall appearance is of
stranding and fluid amongst the left hip muscles, consistent
with resolving hematoma.  Right lower lobe pneumonia versus
contusion bilaterally with small pleural effusion.  Renal
scarring.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac:   The patient continued to be managed
aggressively with high dose Lopressor and Verapamil.  There
was careful attention paid to strict maintenance of intakes
an outputs.  She continued to receive her Bumex 1 gram every
morning.  The overall strategy for her cardiac status was, as
noted in the Cardiac Care Unit note, to administer aggressive
negative inotropics with optimization of patient's
intervascular volume.  Again, the patient has no history of
coronary artery disease.  She did not have any episodes of
arrhythmia during her hospital course.  She did, however,
continue to have a low baseline troponin leak.  Her troponin
was always greater than 1.6 every time it was measured.  It
was never higher than 3.5.

It was believed that this mild troponin leak was secondary to
constant strain given the patient's hyperdynamic state.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was initially transferred to the
Floor on 50% face mask.  She was weaned to room air
successfully on [**8-28**].   She had required Bi-PAP in the
Cardiac Care Unit, but it was never required on the floor.
She did, however, have one episode of tachypnea early on in
her course on the floor on [**8-25**], with respiratory rates
in the mid-40s.  She continued to have O2 saturations in the
high 90s during this time with normal blood pressure and
slightly tachycardic.  This episode self resolved.  She had
subtle EKG changes, specifically ST abnormalities which were
present on her EKG before.  During this setting of tachypnea,
her troponin rose from her baseline one to two range to a
maximum of 3.5.  Chest x-ray taken at this time showed
persistent mild congestive heart failure.

3.  Neurologic:  Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was
initially weaned off her Ativan and her Fentanyl patch was
discontinued.  Initially, the patient's neurologic status
consisted of a very sparse verbal output, not really
following basic commands, very limited attention span, and
persistent cogwheel rigidity.  It was believed on the part of
Neurology and Psychiatry consultations, that her obtundation
was secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy.  She had an
EEG performed that showed global slowing.

A head CT scan did not show any focality.  Over the course in
the floor, she did however, continue to improve in her
neurological status to the point where she was able to
recognize individuals walking into her room.  Her verbal
output increased.  She was able to answer in full sentences.
She had a longer attention span.  She was able to move her
upper and lower extremities more spontaneously.  Over the
last couple of days, she has been complaining of some
depression.  Her psychiatric medications were stopped while
she was in the Cardiac Care Unit.  Those medications should
be restarted at her rehabilitation center once her neurologic
status stabilized.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was initially continued on
tube feeds by nasogastric tube upon transfer to the floor.
She was transitioned to p.o. feeds on [**8-30**] after
passing a bedside speech and swallow evaluation.  Her presen
