Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
HCV/ETOH Cirrhosis here for liver transplant

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2188-4-14**]: Orthotopic liver transplant portal vein to portal
vein,common
bile duct to common bile duct (no T tube), supraceliac conduit
to celiac axis of the donor.
[**2188-4-29**]:ERCP with 10 Fr biliary stent
[**2188-4-29**]: 8 Fr drain to R subhepatic fluid collection
[**2188-4-30**]: Angiogram


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year old female with history of
decompensated alcoholic and HCV cirrhosis, HRS, hyponatremia,
SBP, ascites, grade 1 varices, recently admitted to the [**Hospital 18**]
medical liver service for acute renal failure who presents today
for a liver transplant.  She was sent to [**Hospital 58633**] Rehabilitation
3 days ago following a hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] for [**Last Name (un) **] and
Hyponatremia.  The [**Last Name (un) **] was thought to be due to HRS and the
Hyponatremia was hypervolemic hyponatremia due to fluid excess,
likely related to her cirrhosis as well.  She was started on
octreotide and midodrine while in the hospital.  She has not
required dialysis to date.  They were planning serial
paracenteses every 1-2 weeks and she has been taking cipro
empirically for SBP prophylaxis.  When we learned that a liver
became available her rehab was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she was admitted
directly to the floor, anticipating a liver transplant.
.
Currently she is complaining of a persistent abdominal pain
(states same as last hospitalization).  The pain is around her
umbilicus, sharp, [**10-13**] and worse with movement.  Other than this
she states she is ready for surgery but is clearly frightened of
the procedure.  She has no other complaints at this time.
.
ROS:
Full review of systems was performed and negative except as per
HPI.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o female with HCV and ETOH cirrhosis who underwent
Orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant (piggyback) portal
vein to portal vein, common bile duct to common bile duct (no T
tube), supraceliac conduit to celiac axis of the donor. The
surgeon was Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. The donor was a CDC high-risk
because of the possibility of the donor trading sex for drugs.
The patient was informed of these high-risk behaviors and
accepted the liver. HBSAg, HBSAb, HIV of recipient were negative
at the time of transplant. The HBcAb of the donor was positive,
and the patient has received HBIg per protocol with subsequent
HBsAb titers > 500, and negative HBsAg. Due to the level of her
renal dysfunction, she required CVVHD during the transplant. She
required one further day of CVVH.
She was extubated on POD 1.
She remained in the ICU and while off renal replacement therapy,
her BUN and creatinine continued to rise, however her urine
output was approximately 1.5 liters daily. On POD 3 her BUN was
117, and prograf level was 15. The patient was noted to start
having tonic-clonic seizures, Neuro was consulted, she was
started on Keppra and received an additional hemodialysis
treatment. Following that treatment, the BUN was in the 70s or
less, and creatinine, which peaked at 4.1 has slowly but
steadily declined to less than 2. Once these interventions were
complete, the patient did not appear to have further seizure
activity, however the neurology recommendations are to continue
the keppra for 6 months.
The patient was transferred out of the ICU on POD 7.
Appetite was poor, and feeding tubes have been placed. She has
intermittently pulled the tubes out, despite bridling. The
patients mental status does not appear to be at baseline, she is
noted to be very quiet and uninvolved in personal care and
learning medications. TSH was sent, result was 7.4 and
levothyroxine was started.
AST and ALT have trended down to normal, however the alk phos
which initially w starting to normalize, had started to trend
back up into the 400s, and the total bilirubin which peaked at
16.1 while in the ICU, has trended down, but not normalized.

On POD 14, due to these findings, an ERCP was performed showing
mild diffuse dilation at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring
10 mm. The duct-to-duct anastomosis site appeared patent. A
balloon sweep was performed through the anastomotic site with
minimal resistance. An occlusion cholangiogram revealed
extravasation of contrast most likely from the right hepatic
system consistent with a high grade bile leak. The rest of the
bile duct appeared unremarkable. A 10 Fr biliary stent was
placed. Of note, there was a 3mm stomach body ulcer noted.
Famotidine was switched to [**Hospital1 **] protonix.

Mental status continued as flat and disengaged. TSH was checked
and found to be elevated at 7.3 with T4 of 7.1. Levothyroxine
was started.

An ultrasound/duplex of liver was done to assess for collection.
Findings were notable for high velocity in hepatic artery
concerning for hepatic artery stenosis, large sub-hepatic fluid
collection, large amount of abdominal and pelvic ascites adn
small right pleural effusion. She then underwent US guided
drainage of subhepatic/paracentesis fluid drainage (2 liters of
biliuous fluid)with placement of an 8 Fr drain. Cell count had
wbc of 2750 with 82 polys. This fluid bilirubin level was 17.
Culture was negative. Zosyn was started for infected bile
collection. She was given 25grams of Albumin. Another 2 liters
of bilious fluid drained out with patient becoming tachycardic.
Albumin 5%/500ml was administered with resolution of
tachycardia.

On [**4-30**] hepatic angiogram was performed via right groin approach
with limited contrast used due to creatinine elevation of 1.7.
She was prehydrated with IV bicarb fluid overnight prior to
study. Findings were notable for moderate stenosis just beyond
anastomosis. IR was
