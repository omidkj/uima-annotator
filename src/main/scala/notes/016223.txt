Service:  NEONATOLOGY

ADMISSION HISTORY/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  [**Known lastname **] is a preterm
infant [**Known lastname **] at 28 and 1/7 weeks admitted to the NICU with
a history of severe IUGR and respiratory distress. The mother
is a 35-year-old gravida V, para III, with a history of two
previous preterm deliveries at 32 and 34 weeks gestation.
The mother is B positive, antibody negative, rubella immune,
RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, GBS
unknown.

The pregnancy was complicated by an elevated blood pressure
at 23 weeks gestation which was treated with labetalol.  Her
hypertension was progressive with the onset of proteinuria,
absent end-diastolic flow, and poor fetal growth.

The baby was [**Name2 (NI) **] on [**2127-9-29**] by emergency cesarean section
under spinal anesthesia.  Rupture of membranes occurred
at delivery.  The baby had a birth weight of 595 grams.  The
labor and delivery resuscitation included bag mask
ventilation.  She was intubated with a size 2.5 endotracheal
tube taped at 6.5 cm.  Apgar scores were five and seven.
She was transferred to the NICU for management of IUGR and
respiratory distress.

The physical examination on admission revealed a weight of
595 grams, less than the tenth percentile, length 29.5 cm,
less than the tenth percentile, head circumference 22.5 cm,
less than the tenth percentile.  Temperature 94.1, pulse 140,
respirations 50 on the ventilator.  The blood pressure was
69/32 with a mean of 42.  Anterior fontanelle was open, flat,
and soft.  Her right eyelid was fused.  The baby was
[**Name2 (NI) 43619**].  The palate was intact.  The baby was on a
ventilator with coarse air entry bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
 Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, normal, no audible murmurs.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  She had no
hernia at that time.  The baby was moving all extremities
equally well.  The baby's capillary refill was less than two
seconds.  Femoral pulses were palpable bilaterally.

The assessment and plan at that time was as follows:
1.   symmetrically growth restricted preterm infant with IUGR
likely secondary to PIH chronically,
2.   respiratory distress due to hyaline membrane disease, and
3.   no perinatal risk factors for sepsis.

The plan at that time was to manage her hyaline membrane
disease with Surfactant and a ventilator.  Monitor dextrose
sticks initially and titrate the appropriate glucose infusion
rate to keep the D sticks within normal range.  A CBC will be
checked to follow the platelets.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  RESPIRATORY:  Her initial chest x-ray was diffusely hazy
with fair expansion and was consistent with hyaline membrane
disease (HMD).  She received three doses of Surfactant and
continued on assisted ventilation.  An x-ray showed
mediastinal air.  Radiology and Pediatric Surgery were
consulted.  They felt that the air mass was possibly
consistent with pharyngeal perforation.

On day of life number two, ORL was consulted.  A direct
bedside laryngoscopy was performed which showed no gross
abnormalities.  At this point, we considered performing a CT
of her chest to obtain further information and performing an
ORL evaluation in the Operating Room.  These were not done due
to her instability due to other systems.

On day of life number eight, she underwent a bronchoscopy at
the bedside through her 2.5 endotracheal tube.  Her carina
was visualized and she was noted to have a possible lumen
just proximal to the carina.

On day of life number ten, she was noted to have increasing
oxygen requirement and desaturations.  A chest x-ray was
performed.  This showed that the air mass was no longer
present and subsequently did not reappear.  An esophagogram
was performed on day of life number 15 to rule out any
fistulous connection.  The esophagogram was within normal
limits.

The patient continued on ventilator respiratory support for
approximately 76 days.  The patient was started on Diuril
on hospital day number 35 and she continued on Diuril through
discharge.

In an attempt to maximize the patient's respiratory status
biweekly Lasix was started on her 130th day and the patient
continued on biweekly (Tuesday and Friday) Lasix prior to
discharge.

She remained on CPAP for approximately five weeks then was
transferred to nasal cannula high-flow 600 cc and 100%.  She
transitioned from high-flow nasal cannula to nasal cannula of
approximately 150 cc by day of life number 153, but repeated
attempts to wean the baby from nasal cannula to room air were
unsuccessful.

The patient was treated for two courses of clinical
pneumonia, once while on the ventilator and once while on
CPAP.  The patient had secretions from the oropharynx while
on CPAP that were positive for CMV.  An ID consult was
undertaken and will be discussed further in the ID section.

A Pulmonary consult was obtained in early [**Month (only) 956**]
anticipating the baby going home on supplemental oxygen.  The
Pulmonary consult agreed with the use of Lasix biweekly and
Diuril, making no changes to this regimen.  He thought it
reasonable to give the baby a consistent baseline oxygen
requirement of 250 cc via nasal cannula of 100% oxygen with
the plan to remain there after discharge with further weaning
managed as an outpatient in pulmonary clinic.  She is being
discharged with supplemental oxygen and an oxygen saturation
monitor for spot checks twice a day.  She will follow-up in
Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**].

The patient was off of the continuous saturations and on
bidaily saturation checks for approximately a week and a half
prior to discharge without any desaturations.  Baseline
saturations >94%.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The baby was hypotensive on day of life
number one and required two doses of normal saline followed
by a dopamine infusion which was titrated to keep her mean
arterial blood pressure between 33 and 38.  On day of life
number two, she was noted to have widening pulse pressures
consistent with patent ductus arteriosus.  Although a murmur
was not heard, because the baby's clinical status was
worsening, Indomethacin was given for presumed patent ductus
arteriosus.

On day of life number seven, she was noted to have a soft
intermittent murmur. An echocardiogram was performed which
showed no evidence of a PDA.

On day of life number ten, she had her maximum dopamine
requirements, at which she was on 30 micrograms per kilogram
per minute to maintain her blood pressures.  The baby was
able to be weaned off dopamine by day of life number 15.

On day of life number 18, once again, she was noted to have a
murmur.  An echocardiogram was again performed that showed no
patent ductus arteriosus.  Since that time, the patient was
noted to have no cardiovascular abnormalities.  The murmur
persisted and in light of two normal echocardiograms, the
murmurs was thought to be consistent with peripheral pulmonic
stenosis (PPS).  Blood pressures have remained stable in the
range of 80-100/50-60 with means in the 60s prior to
discharge.

3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
initially started on 80 cc per kilogram per day of IV fluids.
She was noted to have hypoglycemia shortly following admission
to the NICU with a glucose of 26.  She received a bolus and
her dextrose infusion was titrated up to keep her D sticks
between 50 and 70.

On day of life number ten, she was noted to have excessive
weight gain and edema and worsening respiratory status.  Her
fluids were restricted from 140 to 100 cc per kilogram per
day.  On day 15, as previously noted, she had an esophagogram
within normal limits.  She was commenced on trophic feeds on
day of life number 16 and was advanced slowly with her feeds.

The baby advanced up to 150 cc per kilogram per day of breast
milk and then the calories were slowly increased to 32
kilocalories with ProMod.  At that point, she had some more
pulmonary edema and she was fluid restricted to 130 cc per
kilogram per day.

The patient continued on this regimen for app
