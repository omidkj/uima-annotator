Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
garbled speech and left hemiplegia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG tube placement


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 76 year-old woman with HTN, HL, previous embolic
strokes, atrial fibrillation on asa and clopidogrel, recent
pacemaker followed by MI with resultant CHF who presents as a
transfer from OSH for acute onset of garbled speech and left
hemiplegia. The patient had been admitted [**5-13**] for constipation
issues. At 0300 this morning the patient was seen well. At 0330
the patient was found with garbled speech and left hemiplegia. A
NCHCT was done that reportedly did not show any specific
findings. The patient was transferred to the OSH ICU and then
transferred here for evaluation for possible neuro
interventional
procedure.

was 30% with akinesis of anterior septum/wall, apex, and a
-pAF, sick sinus syndrome, prolonged QT --> pacemaker placed
[**2154-4-22**]; Pradaxa stopped prior to PM placement
-chronic dependent edema
-hx of bleeding stomach ulcer
-osteoporosis
-recurrent UTIs
-hx diverticulosis
-IBS

Social History:
Patient had been living with her daughter up until MI in
[**2154-4-28**],
since which she was in [**Hospital **] Rehab. Prior to this stroke, she
was able to ambulate with a cane/walker. Her two daughters are
her HCP. Widowed.

CT/CTA/CTP head/neck [**2154-5-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusion of the right ICA at its bifurcation with no
evidence of
intracranial flow. Lack of right internal carotid atheromatous
disease or
dissection suggests a proximal embolic source.
2. Elevated MTT, low CBV, and low CBF in the entire right MCA
territory,
suggesting completed acute infarction in this region.
3. Large hypodensities of right parietotemporal and left
occipital region
regions, compatible with late subacute right MCA and left PCA
infarction.
4. Atheromatous plaque of left common carotid bifurcation
without significant luminal stenosis.
5. Large bilateral dependent pleural effusions with associated
adjacent
compressive atelectasis.

CT head [**2154-5-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Progressive cytotoxic edema in the right cerebral hemisphere,
compatible with evolving right MCA infarction.
2. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation at this time.
3. Established left occipital and einferior right frontal
infarctions with encephalomalacia.

CXR [**2154-5-19**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-18**], there is a
slight decrease in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary
opacifications, most likely reflecting some decrease in
pulmonary edema despite lower lung volumes. The possibility of
supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting.

CXR [**2154-5-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Signficantly improved bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities.
2. Stable moderate left-sided pleural effusion and resolved
right-sided
pleural effusion.

Video swallow study [**2154-5-28**]:
FINDINGS: Video swallow examination was performed in conjunction
with the
speech and swallow division. Multiple consistencies of barium
were
administered. There was moderate silent aspiration of the nectar
and
honey-thick barium with significantly delayed cough and
swallowing reflexes.  There was no aspiration or penetration
with pudding, however, there was significant oral residue, but
no evidence of pharyngeal resid
