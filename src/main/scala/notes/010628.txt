History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage IV
metastatic colon cancer complicated by an enterocutaneous
fistula and extensive spread of carcinoma into the osotomy bag
who presents with acute on chronic bleeding into her ostomy.
She is well known to this ICU team.
.
She was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**9-11**] - [**2164-9-20**] after
presenting similarly with bleeding from her enterocutaneous
fistula. Patient had been on ASA and lovenox as outpatient, was
given protamine and 4U pRBCs.  She was discharged off aspirin
and lovenox due to the risk of bleeding.  The patient's last
admission was also complicated by a multi-organism bacteremia
(Enterococcus and E. Coli; CoNS felt to be contaminant) and her
PICC was changed, but placed in the same spot due to difficult
with access.  She has been taking vancomycin and ceftriaxone at
rehab (day [**8-25**]; vanco was to be held today due to high trough).
 Today, she had recurrence of bright red blood (approx 200cc) in
her ostomy bag yesterday afternoon.  She is asymptomatic.

On arrival to the ED, initial VS were: 97.9 102 90/56 16 100%
ra.  On arrival to the ED, she triggered for hypotension
initially, but was mentating well and asymptomatic.  Her SBP
dropped down to 70s in the ED.  Her ostomy had some maroon
colored liquid, but she had brown stool on probing the ostomy.
She received 4 L of crystaloid, 1 unit of uncrossed PRBC and was
started on levofed for her hypotension.  Due to concern re:
sepsis physiology, she also received vancomycin and zosyn.
Surgery was consulted in the ED.  They openned her ostomy and
infused surgicel to stop generallized oozing that is felt to be
source of bleeding.  For IV access, she has a right-sided PICC,
which flushed but dose not draw per ED, and a left IJ was placed
in ED.  Of note, her Hct is slightly lower than her Hct on
discharge, but her coags are elevated with a PTT of 150.  She
has been getting heparin SC TID at rehab.  In the ED, she
confirmed that she was full code.   VS prior to transfer were:
88/40, 120 15 100% 2L.
.

- Pulmonary Embolism  - lovenox d/c'ed in past r/t high risk of
recurrent bleeding.

Oncological history (per outpatient oncology note): Metastatic
colon cancer to the lung and pancreaticmass in addition to a
large fungating enterocutaneous fistula. The patient was
originally diagnosed in [**2156-3-12**] with a T3, N0, M0 ulcerating
adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon. In [**2157-9-12**], she
developed metastatic disease in the porta hepatitis. She is
status post multiple systemic chemotherapies, most recent
regimen included 33 cycles of infusional 5-FU and leucovorin,
and most recently she has been started on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
panitumumab, she received her first dose on [**2164-6-1**]. The
patient has received oxaliplatin, Xeloda, cetuximab, irinotecan,
and erlotinib. The patient developed angioedema secondary to
erlotinib. She has also had a reaction to oxaliplatin in the
past. Lastly, the patient had intolerance of cetuximab and
irinotecan due to allergic reaction to cetuximab. The patient
has KRAS wild type disease.  She is not currently a candidate
for chemotherapy per recent d/c summary.


Social History:

Husband died of multiple myeloma in [**9-20**]. She is Spanish
speaking from [**Country 5976**]. Lives in extended care facility, [**Location (un) 582**] in

[**2164-9-27**] CXR
1. New left internal jugular approach venous catheter with tip
in mid SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
2. New small bilateral effusions.
3. Stable right lower lobe pulmonary nodule compatible with
known metastatic colon cancer.
4. Right PICC is slightly more proximal, a finding sometimes
seen with
thrombus formation; recommend clinical correlation for patency.

ECG: ST 117 rightward axis and nl intrevals, low voltageno ST
changes. TWF stable from previous EKG [**2164-9-18**]

TTE: [**2164-9-28**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild pulmonary hypertension

CXR [**2164-9-28**]-
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**9-27**], the central
catheters remain in place. There is diffuse haziness of both
hemithoraces consistent with
substantial layering pleural effusions. This obscures the
appearance ofthe
underlying pulmonary metastasis at the right base.

No definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.

RENAL U/S [**2164-9-29**]-
FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited due to patient's body habitus
and presence of a large ostomy bag. The right kidney measures
10.1 cm. The left kidney
measures 9.8 cm. There is no hydronephrosis. Further evaluation
for masses
or stones is very limited, however, none were seen.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
