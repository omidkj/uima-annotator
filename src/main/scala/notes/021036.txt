History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93843**] is a 84 yo male with a h/o CHF who is transferred
from [**Hospital **] Hospital after a witnessed cardiac arrest at home.
Per his family, he had just gone to dinner and was in his usual
state of health.  His wife heard him fall to the ground and
found him minimally responsive.  EMS was called.  At the time of
EMS arrival, he was unresponsive, pulseless, with a HR 40.  CPR
was initiated and he was paced externally.  At one point, he had
a 90-second asystolic arrest.  CPR was continued.  He received
atropine and was intubated.
.
He arrived to the [**Hospital **] Hospital ER with a perfusing rhythm.
When EMS's leads were removed from the patient's chest, the
patient again became pulseless and bradycardic with a HR 20's.
His internal pacemaker did not initiate a rhythm.  CPR was
reinitiated, and he received atropine 1 mg.  External pacing
leads were reapplied and a perfusing rhythm was obained.  BP was
100's/70's.  Patient was noted to be agitated and moving all
extremities.  He was later transiently hypotensive and was
briefly on a norepinephrine drip.
.
Cardiology consult was obtained in the [**Hospital **] Hospital ED and
his pacemaker was interrogated.  It was concluded that the
pacemaker lead was fractured, which had lead to pacemaker
malfunction.  He is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
On review of symptoms, patient's wife denies that he has any
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She is
unaware of any recent fevers, chills or rigors, exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR ([**8-2**]): 1. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in the
standard positions. 2. Bilateral right greater than left
effusions and densities, which may reflect combination of
atelectasis, infection or aspiration.
3. Findings consistent with overhydration.

CXR ([**8-4**]): Increased retrocardiac density, increased pleural
fluid. Atelectasis or pneumonia is possible. No overt worsening
of fluid status. Positioning may be contributory.

CXR ([**8-5**]): Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left, slightly decreased when compared to prior exam. Increased
retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or early
infection, unchanged.

CXR ([**8-7**]):  Large right and small-to-moderate left pleural
effusion unchanged. No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
Large cardiac silhouette partially obscured by right pleural
effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged.  Transvenous right
atrial and left ventricular pacer leads and right ventricular
pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in standard placements.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93843**] is an 84 yo man with a h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy,
complete heart block with pacer/ICD presenting following cardiac
arrest in the setting of inappropriate ICD firing and pacer
failure.
.
# Pacer Malfunction: Patient has a history of CHB with ICD
device who presented with cardiac arrest due to pacer/ICD
malfunction leading to inappropriate shocks x 6 and pacing
failure. The patient's baseline rhythm, as documented during
recent EP visit, is currently atrially sensed/atrially
paced/ventricularly paced at a rate of 75 beats per minute. That
patient's coumadin was held on admission, and his ICD was
replaced after his was <2.  The patient was continued on
Amiodarone and Coreg during this admission and he had no acute
events during this stay.
.
# Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has an EF ~20%,
which is secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.  On admission,
the patient had a CXR which showed evidence of volume overload,
secondary to aggressive fluid diuresis in the setting of cardiac
arrest.  The patient was diuresed during this hospital stay, and
his CXR and clinical symptoms returned to baseline.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease:  Patient has a history of Coronary
Artery Disease.  The patient was continued on his home dose of
ASA, Zetia, Imdur, and Coreg.  He did not have any acute events
during this hospital admission.
.
# Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in the field during
CPR for presumed cardiac event. There is evidence of volume
overload but no other indications of an acute respiratory
process. The patient was diuresed on admission,
