Brief Hospital Course:
1. Intra-trochanteric fx: secondary to mechanical fall. To OR on
[**10-1**] for DHS w/o complications. Please see [**Month/Year (2) **] for further
details. He is weight bearing as tolerating and will require
aggressive physical therapy. Post op pain well controlled w/
tylenol 1 q 6. He should f/u w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] in 2 weeks time. He will
be offered low dose oxycodone prior to physical therapy to
assist w/ pain control during ambulation

2. CAD: [**Name (NI) **], pt remained hypotensive in the pacu x
1 day. He was eventually transferred to the CCU for transient
pressor requirements. Pt ruled out for MI as cause of
hypotension. He will cont on ASA, statin, low dose coreg and ace
inhibitor.

3. hemodynamics: Per review of [**Name (NI) **] pt, has h/o labile blood
pressures. [**Name (NI) 101830**], pt was hypertensive w/ diastolics
frequently exceeding 100. Consequenly, his ACEi and BB were
titrated for optimal blood pressure control during the
pre-operative period. As alluded to above, pt became hypotensive
post-operatively, requiring up to 12 of dopamine and brief CCU
stay. It was postulated that pt's hypotension was secondary to
severe fluid overload (5 liters positive on pod 1) and residual
of anesthesia. As mentioned above, he was ruled out for mi, had
echo which was neg for tamponade and demonstrated unchanged lv
function. He also was cultured for potential sepsis although he
remained afebrile - these cultures were negative. Pt was found
w/ [**7-17**] point crit drop but was guiac neg. His wound was stable.
He was transfused for goal crit greater than 28. Pt was weaned
off dopamine in the ccu over 24 hours and also gentle diuresed
w/ iv lasix and then iv bumex. In addition to his diuresis, his
acei and bb have been titrated for optimal bp control. Over the
next several days, his blood pressure should be checked
regularly and his beta blocker can be gently titrated for
optimal bp control.

4. CHF: History of severe cardiomyopathy w/ ef 20% and s/p
recent BiV upgrade [**8-12**]. Despite medicine/cardiology
recommendations, pa catheter was placed in the peri-operative
period. Based upon PA cath [**Location (un) 1131**] and overall fluid balance, pt
felt to be in failure and thought to be etiology of hypotension.
Briefly requiring pressor support but during the remainder of
hospital course, diuresed approximately [**2-9**] to 1 liter neg per
day. He will be d/c'ed on standing bumex. His ACEi and Coreg
were gently restarted for maximal bp control.

5. BiV pacer: As mentioned above, ill-advised Swan catheter
placed during peri-operative period. CXR showed no displacement
of leads and still pacing on tele. Should f/u with cardiologist
dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as previously arranged.

6. Anemia: As mentioned above, pt was transfused 2 unit prbc in
the immediate post-operative period. It is unclear to the source
of his anemia. he was guiac neg. Pt required one additional unit
on the floor but has since remained stable.

7. Afib: continued on coumadin and coumadin should be titrated
for goal inr greater than 2.0.

8. Chronic renal insuffiency: renal fx remained stable during
the hospital course.

9. Dementia/agitation: mild agitation in the post-operative
period well controlled w/ standing pm zyprexa.

10. Prophylaxis: will be sent on aggressive bowel regimen,
calcium and vitamin d.
