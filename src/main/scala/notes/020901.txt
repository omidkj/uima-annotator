THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE FROM THE
PREVIOUSLY DICTATED DISCHARGE SUMMARY COVERING UP TO [**3-29**].  THIS DISCHARGE SUMMARY WILL COVER THE HOSPITAL COURSE
FROM [**3-30**] TO [**2121-4-9**].

HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:  The patient had been doing well
on [**2121-3-29**], however, on [**2121-3-30**], the
patient developed bradycardia with blood pressure down to the
70's.  At this time she did not complain of dyspnea or any
other complaints.  Her white blood count had increased to
18.1 from 10.3 and her creatinine had increased to 3.2 from
1.3.  She was not responding to fluid boluses.  On [**Month (only) 956**]
Unit for hypotension.  Her amiodarone and Lopressor were
held.  Urinary tract infection was discovered.  Her Foley
catheter was replaced revealing purulent urine.  Blood
cultures at the time were negative.  Urine cultures grew out
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Hypotension was
felt to be most likely due to urosepsis.  Creatinine at this
time was 3.2.  Her baseline is 1.3.  Her hematocrit was
stable at 33.1 and her rhythm at this time was in and out of
atrial fibrillation.  On [**2121-4-1**], her blood
pressure was stabilized and pressors were discontinued.
Amiodarone was restarted. Her rate was controlled.  At this time
she had poor glucose control and an insulin drip was started.  On
[**4-2**], she was determined to be euvolemic.  On [**2121-4-3**], she was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to
the floor.  Her issues at this time by system:

1.  Cardiovascular:  Atrial fibrillation.  She is on
amiodarone and Lopressor.  She was anticoagulated with
Lovenox 88 mg b.i.d.  Electrophysiology recommendations were
to continue rate control and anticoagulation.  Follow up in
Atrial [**Hospital 9343**] Clinic in three to four weeks.  If the
patient was still in atrial fibrillation, the plan would be
to DC cardiovert her.  Her rate on the floor was well
controlled in the 70's to 80's.  She remained in atrial
fibrillation.  Her blood pressure while on the floor tended
to be low reaching down to the 70's over palpable.  Her
diuretic and blood pressure medications were titrated and her
fluid restriction liberalized.  She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
the Heart Failure Service and the following changes instituted:
Lasix to 40 mg p.o. q. day to be given midday, lisinopril 10 mg
p.o. to be given in the evening and decreasing Lopressor to 25 mg
p.o. b.i.d. The patient's fluid restriction was liberalized to
[**2118**] cc.
2.  Pulmonary:  The patient did not complain of shortness of
breath while on the floor and she maintained good oxygen
saturations while on two liters of oxygen.
3.  Infectious disease:  The patient had
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract
infection.  An endovascular source was theorized but she had
a clean transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2121-3-24**],
and negative blood cultures.  A renal ultrasound on [**4-2**] was normal and showed no abscess, no mass, no perinephric
abscess.  Vancomycin was started on [**4-1**] and was to
be continued for a total of 14 days, per ID Service
recommendations. A PICC line was placed
on [**4-4**].  While on the floor the patient remained
afebrile.  White count increased to 19.3 on [**2121-4-6**],
dropped to 13.1 on [**2121-4-8**].  At this time blood
cultures were drawn that were negative.  Urine culture and
urinalysis were negative.  Chest x-ray was clear and on
examination she had no localizing signs of infection.

4.  Hematology:  Her hematocrit on transfer to the floor was
34 with an MCV of 83, RDW of 15.  Patient's hematocrit
dropped to 28.8 on [**2121-4-7**], no clear source of
bleeding.  She received one unit of packed red blood cells on
[**4-7**] with a bump in hematocrit to 31.6 on [**4-8**].
After a long discussion with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Known lastname 105375**] agreed to
a [**7-13**] week course of anticoagulation with warfarin in
anticipation of a d/c cardioversion in at about 3 weeks.  She
understood the risks and benefits of therapy, including recurrent
bleeding.  The patient was begun on warfarin and lovenox
was discontinued when the level became therapeutic at a goal INR
of 2.0.
5.  Endocrine:  On transfer to the floor her glucose was
controlled.  She was off the insulin drip.  She was on
regular insulin sliding scale and NPH 53/26.  She was on a
prednisone taper.  On arrival to the floor her glucose was
controlled.  She received 15 mg of prednisone q. day on [**4-5**] and [**2128-4-6**] mg of prednisone q. day on [**4-7**]
and [**4-8**] and starting [**2121-4-10**], she was to remain
on prednisone 10 mg q.o.d. for two weeks to complete a taper
begun for treatment of BOOP.  Her prednisone is then to be
stopped.

6.  Renal:  Patient's renal function has remained good while
on the floor.  Her creatinine was 1.2.  She is currently on
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day.

7.  Pain control:  The patient complains of pain for leg
ulcers.  She responds well to morphine sulfate IR 15mg
p.o. q. 6h prn. and tramadol 50 mg p.o. q. 4-6h. p.r.n.

8.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The patient's
electrolytes have been stable while on the floor.  She has
been maintained on a less than two gram sodium diet with now
a 2,000 cc fluid restriction.  Her fluid status should be
carefully monitored.

9.  Physical therapy:  The patient has been bedbound for most
of the entire hospital stay.  She will need aggressive
physical therapy to regain strength as she is very
deconditioned.  Overall, the patient has been stable since
her transfer to the floor from the MICU.

She is deemed ready for discharge to rehabilitation.   She will
need to follow up with Heart Failure Clinic and with her primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She will also f/up
with OB/GYN and EPS for d/c cardioversion.
