Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardaic catherization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old woman with a history of hypertension and
hyperlipidemia who presents with anterior STEMI.  She saw her
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2102-5-1**] with ten days of back pain between her scapula
and it was felt she had a radiculopathy.  She then presented to
[**Hospital1 **] ED on [**2102-4-29**] for worsening back pain, shoulder and
neck pain associated with vomiting.  EKG performed at that time
showed ST elevations in leads I, avL, V2-V5. She was not cathed
at that time as symptoms had been present for 10 days and were
improving. CPK 1670, MB 99.2, RI 8.1, Trop 3.24.  She was cathed
at the outside hospital on day of admission to [**Hospital1 18**] and found
to have subtotally occluded LAD.  She was then transferred here
for PCI. Sheath in RFA, pulses dopplerable.  She was given 600mg
of plavix and aspirin 325mg on morning of admission along with
20mg lasix for LVEDP of 35 mmHG. Echo revealed an LVEF of
[**9-6**]%. Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent cardiac
catheterization with PCI of LAD.  She was started on
integrillin.  Upon transfer to the CCU, she continued to endorse
back pain however she feels it considerably improved.
.
Prior to this event, she has never had any overt anginal
symptoms.  Her exercise tolerance is good, with no shortness of
breath or anginal equivalents with exercise.  She used to swim
frequently however in the past several months, following her
husband's death in [**2101-9-18**], she has stopped exercising.
Cardiac risk factors include hypertension and hyperlipidemia,
and she has been on atenolol and simvastatin for these issues
respectively.  She has never had any prior MIs, known coronary
disease, stress tests, or cardiac catheterization.
.
Review of systems is negative for chest pressure/pain, shortness
of breath, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, blurry
vision, dysuria, fevers, chills.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 47**], recent death of her husband (who was also
in this CCU prior to his death) as well as recent death of her
brother as noted above from CHF.

syndrome or sudden cardiac death in other relatives.

Physical Exam:

[**2102-5-1**] EKG:
Baseline artifact. Probable sinus or other supraventricular
rhythm with
somewhat atypical P wave. Marked left axis deviation.
Intraventricular
conduction delay of right bundle-branch block type with Q waves
in leads V1-V2 with J point and ST segment elevation in leads I,
aVL and V2-V6. Probable extensive anterior wall myocardial
infarction in evolution. No previous tracing available for
comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
[**2102-5-1**] Catherization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed patent LMCA, 100%
proximal
occlusion of the LAD with faint left to left collaterals, patent
LCX.
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg and RVEDP
was
23mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressure was elevated measuring
45/23mmHg.
The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean PCW
pressure was
34mmHg). The systemic arterial pressure was normal measuring
109/69mmHg.
The cardiac index was measured 2.0L/min/m2 using an assumed
oxygen
consumption index.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LAD with a 2.5x28mm
Promus stent
that was postdilated to 2.75mm. Final angiography revealed no
residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III
flow (see
PTCA comments).
4. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Borderline low cardiac index.
4. Successful PCI of the LAD.
5. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.

[**2102-5-2**] Carotid U/S:
Impression: Right ICA stenosis 0.
Left ICA stenosis 0.
.
[**2102-5-2**] Abdominal U/S:
Right pleural effusion and trace free fluid in Morison's pouch.

Otherwise, unremarkable abdominal son[**Name (NI) **].
.
[**2102-5-2**] Cardiac MRI: Report pending
Impression:
1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy with mildly increased left
ventricular cavity size, extensive akinesis/dyskinesis involving
the proximal LAD territory and severely depressed global
systolic function (LVEF 28%). Late gadolinium contrast-enhanced
CMR images demonstrated transmural areas of fibrosis in the
apex, anterior wall, mid-distal septum, and distal inferolateral
walls. Low dose dobutamine images showed no improvement of these
segments consistent with poor likelihood of functional recovery
after mechanical revascularization. 2. Normal right ventricular
cavity size with apical akinesis. The RVEF was moderately
depressed at 30%.
3. Mild aortic regurgitation. 4. The indexed diameters of the
ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal. The main
pulmonary artery diameter index was normal. 5. Mild left atrial
enlargement.
.
[**2102-5-2**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Moderate cardiomegaly, minimal overhydration, mainly
manifested by an increase in diameter of the perihilar vessels.
In addition, small
bilateral pleural effusions are visible on the lateral
radiograph.
No evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No lung
nodules or masses. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
