HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease,
status post CABG in [**2178**] and [**2196**] also with A flutter, CHF
with ejection fraction of 20-25%, status post ICD, multiple
myeloma who presented to an outside hospital on [**2200-3-2**]
with a chief complaint of shortness of breath for three
days.  He states that for the past month he has noticed
decreased energy and increasing shortness of breath.  Six
months ago, he was able to walk up 12 steps without
difficulty and lately he has noticed heavy breathing with 12
steps.  He also notes increasing orthopnea from two to three
pillows over the past month.  Late last month, he was seen in
the Electrophysiology Device Clinic and was started on Lasix
20 mg p.o. q.d.

Just prior to admission, he noticed chills and awoke from
sleep short of breath.  Two days prior to admission, he
reports feeling "washed out" with increasing shortness of
breath and decreased p.o. intake.  On the day of admission,
he awoke feeling short of breath.  He was sitting at the edge
of the bed and then fell to the floor feeling very dizzy,
diaphoretic, and short of breath and called 9-1-1.  He
reports no chest pain throughout all of these episodes,
although he does report decreased p.o. intake, denied nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea.

At the outside hospital, the patient was found to have a
blood sugar of 31.  His 02 saturation was 92% on room air.
He was also found to have bilateral crackles and was given 40
mg of IV Lasix and aspirin, an amp of D50 and a half an inch
of nitroglycerin paste and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

1.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
3.  Lipitor 40 q.d.
4.  Lopressor 50 b.i.d.

10. Glipizide 10 p.o. q.d.
11. Multivitamin 1 q.d.
12. Lasix 20 q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.9, blood pressure 165/65, pulse 76, respirations 20,
saturating 98% on 2 liters.  General:  This is an elderly
gentleman lying in bed, speaking four to five words at a time
with breaths in between.  He was alert and oriented times
three.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate.  No murmurs were
appreciated.  Chest had crackles half way up bilaterally.  No
wheezes.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Sacral edema, cool
feet, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 3.1,
hematocrit 30.4, platelets 167,000.  INR 2.1.  Chem-7
significant for a BUN of 27, creatinine 2.3.  The urinalysis
was significant for 21-50 white cells.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  HYPOGLYCEMIA:  The patient was found to
be hypoglycemic to 31.  He was originally given amps of D50
with difficult control.  He was sent to the ICU shortly after
admission for closer glucose monitoring and was started on a
D10 drip due to very difficult to control blood sugars.  The
patient's hypoglycemia was felt likely due to the use of oral
hypoglycemic agents in the setting of acute renal failure.
These medications may have longer half life in the setting of
acute renal failure and, therefore, the patient's blood sugar
was difficult to control.

The patient was weaned from his D10 drip and remained stable
during the ICU stay.  The patient was transitioned to regular
insulin sliding scale and then restarted on Glipizide only.
The patient will follow-up with his primary care physician
for further monitoring of his blood sugars and titration of
oral hypoglycemics.  The Metformin was held and will not be
restarted due to the patient's chronic renal insufficiency on
acute renal failure at this admission.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient is
status post CABG with significant coronary artery disease.
The patient had enzymes cycled times two, first set being at
the outside hospital and one set here, both of which were
negative as a cause for congestive heart failure.  The
patient was continued on aspirin, statin, beta blocker, and
ACE inhibitor during this admission.

3.  HEART PUMP:  The patient was with CHF with an
ejection fraction of 20-25%.  He reported increasing
shortness of breath in the weeks prior to admission.  The
patient was diuresed with Lasix.  Originally upon admission
to the ICU, the patient was given both Lasix IV and started
on nisiritide drip for diuresis.  The patient diuresed well
with improvement in his oxygen saturation and pulmonary
examination.  The patient's diuretics were transiently held
when his creatinine bumped from his admission of 2.3 to 2.4.
At the time of discharge, the patient was restarted on his
Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. with good effect.

4.  RHYTHM:  The patient is with a history of A flutter.  He
did have evidence of an SVT on telemetry this admission.  The
electrophysiologist made adjustments to his pacemaker and
ICD.  He will follow-up with them as an outpatient.  In
addition, the patient was continued on his Coumadin for A
flutter.  The patient's Amiodarone was also increased to 400
mg p.o. q.d. given the evidence of NSVT.

5.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient is with a baseline
creatinine of 1.8 to 2.  The patient's acute renal failure
may be due to the addition of Lasix, 20 mg as an outpatient.  The
patient's renal function was monitored and was normalized during
this admission and should be followed closely as an outpatient.

6.  MULTIPLE MYELOMA:  The patient is cared for by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  There was no further treatment for this pursued at
the time of this admission.  He will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge.

7.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
continued on a low-sodium diet.  His electrolytes were
monitored and maintained.

8.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was with a urinary tract
infection.  He was given five days of levofloxacin for
treatment of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection.  He
remained afebrile without further evidence of infection.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was with increased weakness after
the episode of hypoglycemia and also due to his shortness of
breath which he had been experiencing for the week prior to
discharge, the patient preferred rehabilitation for physical
therapy to improve his strength prior to discharge to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable with good oxygen saturation
and good glycemic control.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypoglycemia.
2.  Acute on chronic renal failure.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Urinary tract infection.
5.  S/P ICD.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 q.d.
2.  Atorvostatin 40 q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 20 q.d.
4.  Multivitamin q.d.
5.  Amiodarone 400 q.d.
6.  Metoprolol 50 b.i.d.
7.  Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. to be adjusted by primary care
physician.
