Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Platinum Surgery service under
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6633**]. Both her physical exam and her CT scan
confirmed the presence of appendicitis. Specifically, she had a
13mm appendix with an appendicolith, and marked inflammatory
stranding in the right lower quadrant centered about the
appendix. The appendix was dilated but filled proximally with
air and stool. The appearance was consistent with uncomplicated
distal acute appendicitis.  She was also noted to have a ventral
hernia containing fat. She was administered levofloxacin,
metronidazole, hydrated and was taken to the operating room for
a laparoscopic appendectomy and ventral herniorrhaphy, and her
appendix was noted to be gangrenous. Please refer to the
operative note for further details of the operation. A drain was
left in the surgical bed.

In the immediate post-operative period, she was given 1 unit of
packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Ampicillin was added to her
antibiotic regimen to broaden gram-negative coverage given the
state of her appendix. Her pain was controlled adequately and
her urine output was adequate.

On POD#2, she worked with physical therapy. Leter in the day,
she was noted to have slightly decreased breath sounds and mild
shortness of breath (SOB). She was administered a diuretic and
nebulizer therapy with vast improvement in her pulmonary status.
Later the same evening, she developed asymptomatic atrial
fibrillation that ceased with 5mg intravenous metoprolol.
Work-up for acute coronary syndrome was negative.

On POD#3 ([**2122-9-18**]), the patient again manifested atrial
fibrillation and SOB, and began to have oliguria, with a urine
output of 40ml over 4 hours. She was transferred to the
intensive care unit for close monitoring. A central venous line
was placed, and she was given a unit of PRBCs for a hematocrit
of 29.3. A nasogastric tube was placed for decompression of the
stomach, and this yielded 300ml of contents straightaway. After
stabilization and conversion to normal sinus rhythm, the patient
was transferred back to the floor on POD#5.  She had two bowel
movements and was allowed a clear liquid diet, which she
tolerated well.

On POD#6 overnight, the patient again had atrial fibrillation
but was asymptomatic. On the morning of POD#7, she again
suffered dyspnea, and a chest x-ray showed cephalization. She
responded well to intravenous furosemide. Later in the day, she
complained of nausea. Evaluation for acute coronary syndrome
proved negative. She was seen by the cardiology service for
evaluation of her atrial fibrillation and dyspnea.  Her
metoprolol dosage was optimized over the next day.

The cardiology service recommended a trial of beta blocker in
the absence of albuterol and a trans-thoracic echocardiogram.
The former was quite successful in preventing her paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, and the latter showed mild L atrial
dilatation, LVEF of 70%, and 1+MR.

On POD#8, her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed, and she was
advanced to a regular diet. Her antibiotics were discontinued.
She felt quite well, and expressed a desire to be discharged.
She did have a few bouts of diarrhea, but laboratory tests were
negative for clostridium difficile colitis.

On POD#9, the patient was discharged to the [**Hospital1 10151**] Center in good condition. She was afebrile,
tolerating a regular diet, able to walk about and manage most of
her activities of daily living, and was pain-free. She is to
follow up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6633**] in 2 weeks for evaluation
and outpatient treatment.
