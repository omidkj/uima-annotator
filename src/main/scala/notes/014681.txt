Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50 year-old
female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of
15% who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for
observation following elective right heart catheterization.
The patient has an extensive cardiac history with nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of approximately 15%
currently undergoing cardiac transplant evaluation at [**Hospital1 336**].
The patient presents at this hospitalization for elective
right heart catheterization.  The catheterization showed
severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  She
did have increased pulmonary vascular resistance, however,
this was reversible with vasodilator therapy.  Specifically
the patient was given Milrinone and Nipride with resultant
improvement of her hemodynamics.  She tolerated the
procedure without any complications and was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit for close monitoring and further
tailoring of her medication therapy.  At the time of arrival
in the Coronary Care Unit the patient is without any active
complaints.  She denies any chest pain or dyspnea at this
time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 10 to 15%, [**State 531**]
Heart Association class one to two.
2.  Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic
dysfunction.
3.  Status post MVR porcine valve in [**2106-7-17**].
4.  Hyperlipidemia.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix.
2.  Spironolactone.
3.  Coreg.
4.  Lisinopril.
5.  Aspirin.
6.  Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, accountant, currently on medical
leave of absence.  No tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature
97.8.  Blood pressure 98/50.  Pulse 72.  Respirations 15.
Satting 97% on room air.  General, well developed, well
nourished female in no acute distress.  Neck soft and supple.
No JVD.  Cardiovascular regular rate, 2 out of 6 holosystolic
murmur at the apex.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities warm and dry.  No edema with
2+ distal pulses.  Neurological examination nonfocal.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.1, hematocrit 36.2,
platelets 285, creatinine 1.1.  Arterial blood gas 7.42, 44,
112, 30 and 96%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac:  Pump, patient with severe
nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 10 to 15%.
The patient is currently being evaluated for a transplant at
[**Hospital1 336**].  She had a recent cardiac catheterization in [**2108-7-16**], which showed severe pulmonary hypertension, which
improved with Dobutamine and Nitroprusside.  She is currently
elective admitted for repeat cardiac catheterization for
tailored therapy.  In the catheterization the patient did
receive Dobutamine and Nitroprusside with marked improvement
in her elevated PA pressure.  The patient was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit still on a Nitroprusside drip.  She
was aggressively diuresed with Lasix to decrease her wedge
pressure.  She was then converted back to po agents and
slowly weaned off her Nitroprusside drip.  The patient was
successfully weaned off the Nipride drip.  She was restarted
on Carvedilol, Ramipril, Lasix and Aldactone as per her
outpatient regimen.  The patient was briefly on Dopamine to
maintain her blood pressure while on the Nitroprusside drip.
This was successfully weaned off as her Nitroprusside was
weaned.  The patient tolerated her conversion back to po
medications without any complications.  She was then
discharged to home with plans for very close outpatient
follow up and monitoring and continued plans for cardiac
transplant.

Cardiac valve, the patient is status post MVR.  The patient
with tricuspid regurgitation.  She did have a repeat
echocardiogram while in house, which showed only mild mitral
regurgitation and trivial tricuspid regurgitation.  The
patient had no valvular symptoms.

Rhythm, the patient monitored on telemetry throughout her
hospital course and was stable with no arrhythmic issues.

2.  Neurological:  The patient had a mild headache, but a
nonfocal neurological examination.  This was thought to be a
tension headache.  Her symptoms were relieved with Tylenol.

3.  FEN:  The patient was aggressively diuresed as per her
congestive heart failure.  Her electrotolytes were followed.
She was restarted on a regular cardiac diet, which she
tolerated well.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe dilated cardiomyopathy status post MVR.
2.  Pulmonary hypertension reversible with tailored medical
therapy.
