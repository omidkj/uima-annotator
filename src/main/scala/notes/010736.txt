Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 1474**] today for cardiac catheterization


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5444**] is a 58F with multiple medical problems, most
significantly CAD, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CHF (EF
15-20%), s/p defibrillator and permanent pacemaker placement.
Over the past 6 months the patient has been experiencing
increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion, unable
to perform at her usual capacity.  She notes she is usually able
to climb multiple flights of stairs, can currently cannot climb
one.  She denies any PND or orthopnea despite this.  She also
denies chest pain.
.
She presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2158-2-1**] after a few days of
L LE swelling and redness concerning for DVT. U/S negative, and
she was treated for cellulitis with Vancomycin.  During her
hospitalization, she had an echocardiogram which showed a
decrease in her EF from a baseline of 20% to 10-15%, and her
troponin was 0.3.  The decision was made to be transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] she underwent cardiac catheterization
where she was found to have severe native three vessel disease
with nothing to intervene upon.  Her right heart pressures were
severely elevated, and cardiac index was depressed.  She was
transfered to the CCU for abnormal hemodynamics s/p cath.
.
On arrival to the CCU she denies any chest pain, SOB, and she is
able to lie flat without discomfort.  She does have a history of
a "blood clot to her brain" eight years ago.  She denies any
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. ROS is positive for a recent 80lb weight loss in the
setting of an esophageal stricture that induced anorexia.  She
was also was found to have a mass in her small bowel, which was
biopsied negative.  Recent colonoscopy two years ago was wnl, as
was her mammogram this year.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
She does report dyspnea on exertion, and SOB.  She denies
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea.

and died of an MI in her sixties.

Physical Exam:

HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 11 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Irregularly irregular rhythm, 2-3/6 systolic murmur at the
axilla
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. No crackles, wheeze,
rhonchi anteriorly.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness. No abdominial
bruits.
Ext: 3+ pitting edema to the knees.  2+ palpable pulses
bilateral at dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.  Left calf
erythema overall improving according to the patient
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP

Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP


Pertinent Results:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the anterior wall, septum, distal LV segments and apex (c/w LAD
distribution). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are structurally-normal, but
fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with severe
regional systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild right ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Severe
tricuspid regurgitation secondary to annular dilation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-2-7**], the
findings are similar.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
severe three vessel disease. The LMCA was free of
angiographically
apparent obstructive coronary disease. The LAD was noted to be
100%
occluded ostially. The LCX had ostial 50% disease with
collaterals to
the RCA. The RCA had severe diffuse disease.
2. Venous conduit angiography revealed an occluded SVG to RCA
and a non-obstructed SVG-diagonal. Selective conduit angiography

revelaed a widely patent LIMA to LAD. The Left subclavian was
noted to
have a 50% proximal lesion.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 26 mmHg ands LVEDP of 26 mmHg. Pulmanry
arterial
pressures were elevated with PASP of 67 mmHg. The cardiac index
was low
at 1.67 l/min/m2.
4. Systemic pressure was normal and there was no AS gradient
noted upon
pullback from LV to ascending aorta.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. Occluded SVG to RCA, patent SVG to diag, and patent LIMA to
LAD.
3. Low cardiac index.
4. Severely elevated right-sided cardiac filling pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
53F with multiple medical problems including CAD, Class III NYHA
heart failure, and HTN presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization after she was found to have a troponin elevation
to 0.3, and a depressed ejection fraction from baseline.
Cardiac cath on this admission was largely unchanged from her
prior cath in [**2150**] with no intervenable disease.  Her troponin
elevation was thought to be secondary to myocardial stretch in
the setting of increased preload, as she was clinically in a CHF
exacerbation.  We performed an echocardiogram which showed
severe wall motion abnormalitied in the left ventricle,
segmental in nature and consistent with CAD.  She was also noted
to have severe tricuspid regurgitation, which did not change
with diuresis to her dry weight.  Based on this, the decision
was made to proceed with tricuspid valve replacement, which is
scheduled for [**2158-3-2**]  We optimized her medical management by
adding losartan and metoprolol to her regimen.
.
She was also noted to have a left lower extremity cellulitis,
which resolved with 7 days of vancomycin.  She received three
more days of doxycycline to complete a course.
