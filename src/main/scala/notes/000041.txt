Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, total body pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of CAD, CHF with EF of 40%, recent admission
with respiratory failure requiring intubation who presents with
total body pain and chest pain.  The patient's current symptoms
began on Saturday with nausea.  The following day (one day prior
to admission), the patient experienced aching throughout her
body, including her back, chest, and the back of her head.  This
morning, the patient awoke from sleep at 6am due to right index
finger pain, erythema, swelling, and calor which then spread to
the rest of her body (back, chest, back of head).  Finger pain
is described as stiff, sore, and achy with associated calor.
Total body pain is described as sharp body aches which is
generalized, which lasted until she received Morphine in the ED.
 The patient describes chest pain along with her total body
pain, and received SL Nitro x3 without relief.  The pain had
similar features to her prior anginal equivalent, during which
she experienced chest pain, shortness of breath, and upper back
pain, but her current pain consists of nausea without dyspnea or
lightheadedness.
.
In the ER, vitals were T99.9  BP 156/61  P76  R18  PO2 100% 2L.
Chest pain was [**7-18**] on arrival and she was started on a nitro
gtt without significant relief of symptoms.  However, symptoms
resolved with morphine, currently 0/10.  EKG revealed sinus
rhythm with baseline LBBB and no acute EKG changes.  She
received Morphine and a 500cc bolus while en route with EMS, and
received additional Morphine in the ED.
.
On evaluation on the floor, pt was asymptomatic and complaining
of thirst.  She denies PND, reports 2 pillow orthopnea which has
remained unchanged for years.
.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. Denies fevers/chills,
night-sweats, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, rash.  She does
report (+) congestion/cough with white sputum since
hospitalization, helped by albuterol.  All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**4-29**]): Two views are compared with the bedside examination
obtained some 10 hours earlier, as well as previous examinations
of [**4-16**] and [**2165-4-19**]. There has been clearing of the findings of
CHF and bilateral pleural effusions, with residual rounded LV
enlargement and atherosclerotic change involving the thoracic
aorta. The lungs appear hyperinflated, suggestive of underlying
obstructive disease; however, there is no focal airspace
opacity. There is diffuse osteopenia with slight anterior
wedging of several thoracic vertebrae and resultant slight
kyphosis. There is no acute abnormality of the thoracic
skeleton.
.
CXR ([**5-5**]):
1. Worsening pulmonary edema and increasing small pleural
effusions.
2. Bilateral lower lobe airspace opacities, which may be due to
dependent
areas of pulmonary edema or superimposed secondary process such
as aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Followup radiographs
after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
.
CXR ([**5-6**])
CHEST, AP: Mild interstitial edema has slightly worsened. Mild
cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions are
unchanged. Bibasilar consolidation is stable. The cardiac
silhouette is normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
IMPRESSION: Slightly increased vascular congestion.
.
SUPINE ABDOMEN ([**5-6**])
Limited study with partially imaged left abdomen. Bowel gas
pattern present is nonobstructive with air seen in non-dilated
loops of small and large bowel. There is no free intraperitoneal
air or pneumatosis. The cardiac silhouette is moderately
enlarged. There is a questionable deep sulcus sign in the right
hemithorax, which in the right clinical setting, may represent a
pneumothorax. There is small opacification in the left lower
lung.
