lateral ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
Course on the surgical service:
The patient was admitted to the trauma surgery service on
[**2177-3-24**].  He was initially admitted to the ICU due to his mental
status and ICH for frequent neuro monitoring.  His neuro exam
remained non-focal, although he was AxOx1-2 (knew he was in a
hospital but thought it was [**2109**]).  His initial head CT showed
multiple foci of right frontal and temporal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding edema, small acute right subdural
hematoma, areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal
and temporal regions, and tiny high density in the dependent
portion of the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], concerning for
intraventricular hemorrhage, no mildine shift. Repeat head CT
later on the day of admission showed no significant change. The
patient's C-spine CT showed no fracture and his c-spine was
cleared clinically.  Due to the risk for seizures, the patient
was started on dilantin with appropriate lab levels.  This was
changed to keppra on [**2177-3-27**].  He had no seizure activity during
hospitalization but he continued to have a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status.  He was placed on a CIWA scale due to his history
of alcoholism.  He did not appear to have any withdrawal
symptoms.  The patient had a chest xray concerning for
pneumonia.  His sputum was cultured.He also had a urine culture
positive for e.coli. He was treated for these infections with
vanc, ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  The patient did have
recurrent fevers.  His chest xrays normalized.  His blood
cultures did not grow anything.  His workup for fever and
altered mental status was broadened to include chest CT and ruq
u/s.  On [**2177-3-28**], the patient was felt to have no further
surgical issues and was transferred to the medicine service for
continued treatment of a presumed pneumonia vs fever of unknown
source.

MICU course:

Patient was transferred to the medical ICU for altered mental
status and tachypnea.  CTA was negative for PE.  O2 Sat was
stable on NC oxygen.  Tachypnea and hypoxia improved.

For altered mental status and fevers, repeat head CT showed no
change in bleed.  Prednisone and levetiractam were continued. LP
showed blood and possible infection.  He remained febrile. His
antibiotics (vanc/ceftriaxone) were increased to meningitis dose
ceftriaxone, and acyclovir was added for HSV coverage pending
PCR. TSH was normal.  Mental status improved gradually.
Hyponatremia was stable, likely secondary to SIADH from
intracranial process. Management of other chronic issues was
continued as per surgical teamPatient was transferred back to
the general medical floor.
.
.
On the medical floor, mental status remained stable, extremely
drowsy and difficult to arouse. Neurology was following and
recommended CTA to follow up possible venous sinus thrombosis
seen on CT. On the day of transfer to the MICU, patient
underwent CT. At the time of departure from cc7, his O2 Sat was
mid-90s on 2L NC. Upon return from CT, O2 was 83% on 2L. 6L was
required to bring O2 Sat to 91%. CXR showed new LLL and partial
LUL collapse. ABG was 7.50/30/44. Mental status at that time was
notable for alert and tracking, nonverbal. Shortly thereafter,
O2 Sat fell, and nonrebreather was applied. Despite this, O2 Sat
fell into the 70s. He was transferred emergently back to the
MICU.
.
In the MICU, initial VS T 101.8, HR 121, RR 40, O2 Sat 70%.
intubation proceedings were begun. Family was hesitatant
initially but decided to go forward given the possibility of a
rapidly reversible mucous plug. Patient was intubated with
etomidate and succinylcholine. O2 Sat initially remained in the
low 70s on 100% FiO2. Fiberoptic broncoscopy was immediately
performed, yielding copious thick yellow sputum. With this O2
Sat rose to 100%. Patient received 2 boluses of fentanyl 50 mcg.
After procedure, patient went into SVT at a rate a 160, and SBP
fell from ~200 to 60s. Defibrillator pads were applied, but just
prior to synchronized cardioversion, patient sponteously
converted to NSR a at a rate of 110. SBP remained 70s.
Peripheral neosynephrine was started, and left subclavian line
was placed. BP improved to ~120 with .5 of neosynephrine.
Multiple fluid boluses were administered.
