History of Present Illness:
62 year old male has a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia,
type 2 diabetes and CAD s/p OM1 stenting in [**2122**]. Over the past
six months the patient has been having episodes of what he
describes as "anxiety attacks", associated with chest tightness.
Many of these episodes have correlated with exertion although
several months ago he did have some episodes that woke him from
sleep. Last evening while taking the dogs out into his back yard
he had additional chest tightness, unassociated with any other
symptoms. Stress testing in [**2132-9-15**] revealed new septal
hypokinesis with exercise. He was referred for left heart
catheterization. He was found to have three vessel diseae and is
now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2132-11-13**] Cath: 1) Selective coronary angiography of this
right-dominant system demonstrated severe 3 vessel CAD. The
distal LMCA had 70-80% stenosis. The origin and proximal segment
of the LAD had diffuse 80% disease with good distal targets. The
mid LCX stents were subtotally occluded with probable good
targets distal to the stents. The RCA was totally occluded at
the origin with left-to-right collaterals. 2) Limited resting
hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressures with a
central aortic pressure of 111/61 with a mean of 73mmHg. 3)
Refer for CABG

[**2132-11-14**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA 80-99% stenosis. Left ICA 70-79%
stenosis.

[**2132-11-14**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF=35 %). with normal free wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before surgical
incision.
POST_BYPASS: Normal RV systolic function. Overall LVEF 40% to
45% Mild MR>
Intact thoracic aorta. Prebypass hypokinetic lateral wall seem
to be moving well.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17684**] was admitted following his cardiac cath which revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease. He underwent
pre-operative work-up and on [**11-14**] was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  He did show Right Upper Lobe collapse on
CXR, which resolved.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Glyburide and Metformin were titrated for blood glucose
management.  The patient will keep a blood glucose log on
discharge to present to his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
