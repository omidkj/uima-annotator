Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was given 1 amp d50 in the field (for a fsg of 29) and
100 mg thiamine without improvement.  He arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
and was still unresponsive with FS 69. He developed seizure
activity and was given a second amp of d50 in addition to Ativan
2 mg iv which successfully broke his sz.  He found to be drowsy
but arousable and oriented x3.
.
Upon arrival to the floor the patient was again found to be
unresponsive and developed a second episode of seizure.  He was
given Ativan 1 mg IV with resolution of sz.  However, that time,
the patient's cardiac enzymes returned with a CK of 296 MB 6
Trop 0.37. An EKG revealed new TWI in V5-6. The Cardiology
fellow felt this was likely due to demand ischemia precipitated
by seizure and hypertension. The patient was then transferred to
the MICU for closer monitoring.
.
On arrival to the MICU the patient is somnolent but easily
arousable. He was stabilized overnight with q1 hr fsg checks and
D5NS @75/hr.  The patient accepted ASA prophylaxis but refused
Heparin gtt and transfusion.  The risks of going without these
therapies in the setting of ACS were carefully explained to the
patient who opted to go without those therapies.
.
The following day the patient was stable and transferred to the
floor without event for a brief observation period prior to
discharge. [**Last Name (un) **], Rheum, and Heme-Onc consultants all visited
with Mr. [**Known lastname **] to discuss the possibility of starting Rituximab
vs. Prednisone therapy to treat his autoimmune antibody
syndrome.  Plans were made to finish the work-up and discussion
in outpatient clinic.

You were transitioned to your home dose Glargine [**Hospital1 **] + SSI and
tranferred to the floor once your seizures resolved.  However,
you have some findings on your heart tracing and in your blood

the Heparin and blood transfusion which you declined.
