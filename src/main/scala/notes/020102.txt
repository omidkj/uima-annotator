spinal compression fractures who presents from an OSH with
hypoxia and bilateral PNA [**1-5**] chronic aspiration.

pills suctioned during nasotracheal suction.  The patient would
desat to the high 80s for a brief period after an aspiration
event.  He had been started on Unasyn at the OSH and completed a
10 day course of Unsayn.  He was treated with scheduled
Ipratropium nebs and PRN albuterol nebs in the ICU which help
with his symptomatic dyspnea.
.
*Oliguria: Pt responds well to fluid boluses. However +2.7L
since being in ICU so may benefit from IV lasix given that he is
likely no longer dry (nl BUN/cr). Euvolemic at time of discharge
but will need monitoring of fluid status. Currently receiving
free water boluses per PEG, no need for furosemide at this time.

stable.

lower extremity exam was stable throughout his admission and
there was no evidence of infection.  Per the patient's wife, he
