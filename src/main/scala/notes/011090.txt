ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild
regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid antero-septal
hypokinesis. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is
borderline normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with
right ventricular pressure/volume overload and superimposed
conduction delay.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular
inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of
[**2102-3-31**], the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation
has increased.
The degree of pulmonbary hypertension detected has also
increased. Overall
regional LVEF may appear better, however, intrinsic forward EF
may be reduced
secondary to valvular regurgitation.

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Bilateral pleural effusions likely
slightly worse when compared to the previous exam. There is an
increased retrocardiac left lower lobe collapse. There are
increased perihilar interstitial opacities consistent with
slight worsening in CHF. There is unfolding of the aorta with
wall calcifications. The cardiac contour remains enlarged.
