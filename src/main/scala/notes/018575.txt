Chief Complaint:
Palpitations and light-headedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
86 yo female with h/o afib, presents from assissted living with
palpitations, lightheadedness, presyncope and labored breathing
for 3 days. Per patient has had atrial fibrillation since [**2100**].
At that time she was walking home from the grocery store and had
severe shortness of breath and palpitations. She was worked up
in [**State 2748**] and placed on toprol 25mg in am. She had some
light-headedness with the full dose of Toprol in the morning and
so was switched at some point to [**1-18**] tab (12.5mg) in the am and
[**1-18**] in the pm. She has had palpitations with this off and on
since then. This is the first time that she has felt
light-headed with this. Over the last few days she has felt
light-headed and felt that her heart was racing/vibrating. This
morning she says that everything went "cloudy" and she felt like
she was going to faint. She told the people at her assissted
living and they sent her to the ED.
.
 VS in ED were T:97.5 HR80 BP: 93/60 RR 20 O2 99%RA. EKG in ED
showed 3:1 block versus complete AV dissociation (narrow complex
QRS at rate of 60, sinus rate of ~180). ep was paged and in ER
immediately - 3:1 block, no active EP issues. labs in ED showed
Tn 0.02, MB 2, EP recommended trending to ROMI and will continue
to follow on floor for ? of possible pacemaker placement.
.
On presentation to floor patient denied light-headedness even
with standing. Denied any history of chest pain. Felt that pulse
was better and she felt better. She denied ever feeling short of
breath.  The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, new
exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, PND or leg edema,
claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or
transient neurologic deficits.  No change in weight, bowel habit
or urinary symptoms. No cough, fever, night sweats, arthralgias,
myalgias, headache or rash.  All other review of systems
negative.

 - CHF (although patient denies this)
 - Atrial fibrillation on coumadin

Brief Hospital Course:
EKG demonstrated [**2104-3-28**] with atrial flutter with 3:1 block and
occasional PVCs. Compared to prior now in atrial flutter as
opposed to atrial premature beats.

TELEMETRY demonstrated: rates 80s-90s

#. CAD: Had cardiac cath in [**2101**] with no intervention done per
patient although does have vague history of "scar" on heart.
Patient had three sets of cardiac enzymes that were negative.
She had no complaints of chest pain and her EKGs showed no ST/TW
changes so she was essentially ruled out for MI.

#. Pump: Nl TTE in [**2103-6-17**]. Euvolemic on exam.

#. Rhythm: Admitted with some what looked like atrial flutter
with 3:1 block. CHADS2 score 1. EP was consulted and felt that
she should be rhythm controlled so that she could come off of
coumadin given the recent guaiac positive stools. She was
started on propafenone for rhythm control and continued on her
coumadin. She had some episodes of tachycardia (180 BPM)
overnight and thus her toprol was re-started (12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]). She
had some bradycardia and then long pauses on telemetry requiring
atropine. For this she was transferred to the CCU for further
management of her arrhythmias and potentially a PPM placement.
***CCU stay: Initially while monitored on telemetry, she was
still having pauses on tele, this was thought secondary to beta
blockade.  As her beta blocker wore off, he HR picked up and she
stopped having pauses. She was anxious prior to procedure but
went ahead. She had her pre-procedure dose of Vancomycin and
after completion had some flushing of forehead and scalp. She
underwent the procedure without complications.
*****FLOOR stay: She was transferred to the floor after the PPM
placement. She had no further complications. She remained paced
at a rate of around 70 on the telemetry. She had no
palpitations, sob, chest pain. Her pacemaker site was without
hematoma or sign of infection. She had a followup chest x-ray
that showed ppm leads in place. She will follow up with device
[**Hospital1 **] in 1 week and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22973**] in 3
months.

#. Entero-cutaneous fistula: Throughout admission the wound
looked clean and there was no significant discharge from it. She
continued her normal wound care regimen while she was
hospitalized.

#. Urinary frequency: patient noted that she has no dysuria and
that frequency is a common symptom for her for several years.
However, she was nervous about having an infection and wanted us
to check it so a UA C+S were sent and were pending at time of
transfer.
