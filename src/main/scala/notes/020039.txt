Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
transient arm/leg weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. carotid stenting
2. femoral artery clot removal

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 year old male with a history of afib on
warfarin, cad s/p 3 MI's, PVD, and carotid stenosis s/p right
carotid stenting now presenting with transient right arm and leg
weakness.  As per the patient, he was walking in the lobby of
his
wife's PCP when his right leg suddenly "gave-out" and he fell to
the ground hitting the knee against a chair on the way down.  He
did not lose consciousness or experience any head ache or visual
disturbance prior to or during the event.  Moreover, the patient
states he's had episodes over the last 3-4 months were the right
side of his body has felt weaker and has nearly fallen in the
past.  The last such episode occurred a few days prior to
admission.

When the patient told his wife's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] referred him to an OSH
ER, from there they transferred him to [**Hospital1 **] for further
management.

Pertinent Results:

C/M/P: 8.7/2.9/6.3
Coags:  22.3/41.8/3.3

Head CT:
areas of hypoattenuation in the left frontal lobe consistent
with old infarct; periventricular white matter changes
consistent with small vessel disease

Carotid US:
Findings of left internal carotid artery occlusion. Of note, no
prior studies available for comparison. Ultrasound can not 100%
accurate in differentiating between a 99% stenosis and an
occlusion. Clinical followup is warranted. On the right there is
significant plaque with a 60-69% stenosis.

Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20%). The
septum is
akinetic. The inferior wall is severely hypokinetic. The
remaining walls are
hypokinetic. There is no thrombus seen in the left ventricle.
Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The number of
aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neurology service for management
of a presumed TIA episode.  He underwent a stenting procedure on
the right carotid artery several days into his admission which
was performed successfully.  He subsequently developed loss of
his distal pulse in the right lower extremity and had to undergo
an emergent surgical clot removal to restore pefusion and it was
done successfully.  Over the remainder of the patient's
admission on the Neurology service his neurologic deficits
improved to where he was less weak and more alert.  He was
discharged in stable condition.
