Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
emergent CABGx3 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->, SVG->) [**10-30**]


History of Present Illness:
75 y.o. female that presented to OSH with chest pain and
shortness of breath. She was found to have 2mm ST segment
depressions in I, aVL, II, aVF, V4 and V6 with reportedly old
LBBB. She was started on heparin, eptifibatide, clopidogrel
600mg and underwent left-heart cath and found to have 95% LCx,
90% LMCA, 90% LAD, and occluded RCA with collaterals from LAD.
LCx was stented with Voyager 2.5x15mm. Patient was felt to have
worsened MR secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction that
seemed to improve with stenting of LCx. IABP was placed, and she
was started on dopamine and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further
management and possible CABG.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Small LV cavity.
Mildly depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Mildly dilated RV
cavity. Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve leaflets
with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet motion. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Thickened/fibrotic tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS.
Mild [1+] TR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views. Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior septum and
posterior wall. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic
rheumatic deformity. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.



Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the CCU. She was taken to the operating room
emergently for cardiogenic shock where she underwent a CABG. She
was started on vancomycin periop for prophylaxis was she was in
house preoperatively. She was transferred to the ICU in critical
but stable condition on epinephrine, neosynephrine and propofol.
She was transfused 3 units post op for anemia/hypotension and
shock. She remained intubated with IABP overnight. Her IABP was
dc'd in the morning of post op day 2. Her epi was weaned to off
and she was extubated on the morning of post op day 3. She was
transferred to the floor on POD #4. She was seen by physical
therapy who [**Hospital 24260**] rehab placement, and she was ready for
discharge on POD #6. Her white count on discharge was 17, her
incisions appear to be healing well, and her white count should
be rechecked on [**11-8**].
