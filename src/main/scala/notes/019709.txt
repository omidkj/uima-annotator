Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ceftazidime / Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure, hypotension, sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
irrigation and debridement of right hip

History of Present Illness:
74 y/o F with h/o COPD, CAD s/p CABG [**2113**], CHF (last echo [**11-11**]
with EF 45-50%), with septic Right hip s/p hardware
removal/irrigation on [**12-5**] at OSH, subsequent abx coverage with
6 weeks of Vanc/Levo (until [**1-19**]). Discharged to rehab
initially where she was noted to have a new 02 requirement (not
on oxygen at home previously), and presented from rehab on [**12-23**]
to [**Hospital3 1280**] w/ acute SOB. Pt improved with diuretics and O2,
but worsened over 24hrs and was transferred to [**Location (un) 620**] ICU on
[**12-25**]. As pt had acute renal failure, no PE workup was done.  Pt
did not respond to Lasix or Natrecor. Pt developed fever to 101
on [**12-27**], with leukocytosis and was C diff positive. She was
placed on Ceftaz in addition to coverage with Vanc/Levo, and
rash developed, so ceftaz was discontinued.  Repeat echo showed
depressed EF at 30%. Pt had two episodes of chest pain where CE
cycled and neg x 3 no EKG changes. BNP measured and noted to be
increased to 1500, creatinine peak at 2.8 from baseline 1.3, and
AIN was suspected in the setting of the reaction to Ceftaz. On
[**12-29**] pt had an episode of hypotension and was started on
dopamine because she was already so fluid overloaded. Pt was
intubated at that time for persistant dyspnea and respiratory
decline.

Pertinent Results:
HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS RIGHT  [**2120-12-30**] 9:52 AM
IMPRESSION: Presumed right prosthesis removal, with near total
destruction of the right proximal femur, possibly consistent
with an ongoing septic arthritis. Clinical correlation and joint
tap if necessary are recommended.

ECHO Study Date of [**2120-12-30**]
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately
depressed (30-35% ) Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include basal
inferior, inferoseptal and inferolateral akinesis . The views
are limited but
the anterior wall appears hypokinetic. 3.Right ventricular
chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
mitral
stenosis.There is trace MR.
7.There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o F, admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Intensive Care Unit on [**2120-12-29**]
intubated secondary to respiratory failure in the setting of
sepsis secondary to right hip infxn with hypotension requiring
dopamine for BP support. Hospital course complicated by

1. Respiratory failure: Etiology multifactorial [**3-11**] COPD, CHF,
fluid overload, in the setting sepsis. CXR sent w/ pt on
transfer [**12-29**] notable for bilateral infiltrates [**3-12**] way up both
lung fields. Concern for pulm edema and CHF on top of baseline
COPD. ABG at time of intubation revealed a respiratory acidosis.
The patient remained intubated until [**1-3**] when she was
successfully extubated. Post extubation the patient continued to
have intermitent episodes of tachypnea and hypoxia requiring
additional oxygen supplementation in the form of a face mask and
nasal cannula. These were thought to be related to fluid
overload and flash pulmonary edema related to increased
activity. She improved quickly after onset of these episodes
when she received treatment with IV lasix, albuterol nebs, and
morphine. At the time of discharge she was stable on 2 L NC but
had additional supplemental O2 requirements during exertion. She
was started on CPAP the night of [**1-8**] and was able to tolerate
this intermittently. She was not using this therapy on a regular
basis but it could potentially be useful in the future. She may
require a formal sleep study on an outpatient basis to determine
if she does indeed require CPAP.

2. CV: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG with reportedly patent
grafts by cath [**2119**]. During her hospital stay, patient initially
required blood pressure support with dopamine in the setting of
initial sepsis. She was quickly weaned off pressors and did not
require any additional BP support during her stay. A Swan-Ganz
catheter was placed soon after her initial arrival to the ICU in
order to differentiate the nature of her shock (cardiogenic vs.
septic). She had Cardiac output of 9 with low SVR of 460 showing
a picture more consistent with septic as opposed to cardiogenic
shock. The catheter was used for several days for intensive
monitoring to keep MAP >60, CVP >10, and PAWP >20. The Swan was
d/c'd on [**1-3**]. During her hospital course, several EKG's were
performed in the setting of the transient tachypnea, but no
changes were noted from baseline. Her cardiac enzymes were
cycled during this admission and she did not have a rise in her
troponin. At the time of discharge the patient continued to be
on a statin, ASA, B-blocker, and ACE for BP control. She may
require a cath to revaluate her cardiac function after discharge
from rehab. This decision will be differed to her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the
