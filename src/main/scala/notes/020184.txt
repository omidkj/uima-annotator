History of Present Illness:
70 year old female has a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia,
prior tobacco abuse, a family history of coronary artery
disease, an abdominal aortic aneurysm and subclavian steal
syndrome. She had upcoming plans for possible subclavian
stenting at [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2181-9-12**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 43078**]. She reports that over the past months she has noticed
increasing dyspnea on exertion. It has been most noticeable when
walking up a [**Doctor Last Name **] or climbing up a flight of stairs, requiring
her to stop and rest for 5 minutes before continuing on. There
have even been a few times where she has noticed this while
washing her hair. She denies any specific complaints of chest
discomfort. Recent stress testing revealed possible inferior
ischemia. She was subsequently referred for cardiac
catheterization.  The LAD was found to be dissected during
cardiac catheterization.  IABP was placed and the patient was
transferred to the Operating Room for surgical
revascularization.

[**2181-8-24**] Cardiac Catheterization:
Coronary angiography:  Left dominant
LMCA:  Calcified proximal 50-60% eccentric lesion
LAD:  Proximal 70% stenosis moderate to severe tortuosity.
LCX:  Dominant vessel with small OM branches.
RCA:  Small nondominant with origin 80% stenosis supplying acute
marginals
Ramus:  Origin 40%
Interventional details:
Change for 6 French XB3.5 guide.  Crossed with Prowater wire
easily.  Performed IVUS to interrogate the LMCA and LAD with the
Atlantis catheter.  The LMCA was calcified as was the LAD.  The
MLD of the LAD was 1.5 mm.  The reference vessel diameter was
3.2cm.  The CSA was <1.8 CM2. The LMCA had a CSA of >9.0 cm2.
Attention was then turned to repair of the LAD since the LMCA
was moderate.  The Prowater wire was directed into the distal
LAD with difficulty given vessel tortuosity.  At this point a
dissection in the distal LAD was noted.  Over the course of the
next 2 minutes the LAD abruptly closed.  Integrilin
(eptifibatide) was administered and ACT was confirmed.  Pilot 50
wire and PT [**Name (NI) 13126**] intermediate wires could only be directed
into the mid LAD and septal branches within the dissection
plane.  A balloon inflation with a 2.0 mm balloon was performed
restoring TIMI 1 flow to the distal vessel.  A myocardial stain
was noted with distal injection but no perforation was noted.
CSURG was consulted for revascularization of the LAD.  A 30 cc
IABP was inserted into the right common femoral artery
prophylactically.
The patient developed jaw pain during abrupt closure which was
improving ([**2-22**]) upon transfer to the surgical suite.  She
tolerated the procedure well otherwise and left the laboratory
in stable condition.

[**2181-8-24**] INTRAOP TEE:
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is an intra-aortic balloon pump in good position with the
tip distal to the left subclavian artery. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is on a phenylephrine infusion.
Biventricular function is unchanged. There is moderate aortic
regurgitation. There is moderate aortic stenosis which is
unchanged. There is trace mitral regurgitation. The ascending
aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta are intact. There is a
small mobile density in the aorta at the transition from the
aortic arch to the descending aorta. The tip of the intra-aortic
balloon pump is identified several centimeters distal to this
point.

POST-SECOND BYPASS RUN: The patient is on epinephrine,
milrinone, and phenylephrine infusions. The left ventricle is
hyperdynamic. The left ventricular cavity size is significantly
reduced compared to the first post-bypass exam. Right
ventricular function is mildly depressed. Aortic regurgtation is
unchanged. Aortic stenosis is unchanged. The ascending aorta,
aortic arch, and descending aorta remain intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred into the cardiac catheterization [**Last Name (STitle) **] and underwent
catheterization that revealed multivessel coronary artery
disease. Percutaneous intervention was
