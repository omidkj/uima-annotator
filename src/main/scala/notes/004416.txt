HOSPITAL COURSE (continued):  On postoperative days #19 and
#15, the patient had some complaints of stomach and back
pain.  She had ventricular ectopy on telemetry.  She had a
blood pressure of 135/64 with a heart rate of 88.  Her
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains showed 150 cc of serosanguinous
drainage. She was alert and awake.  Her sternal wound had
decreased erythema with minimal breakdown.  Her heart rate
was in sinus rhythm.  Her lungs were clear bilaterally.  She
had 1+ edema bilaterally.  Her wound was clean, dry and
intact.

The patient's electrolytes were rechecked with magnesium and
potassium repletion.  She continued on Levaquin and
Vancomycin.  She was followed by the respiratory care and
nutrition services as well as the plastic surgery service, as
they had done her bilateral pectoralis flaps.  She received
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer therapy for her pulmonary
treatments.  She continued to be followed by the plastic
surgery service.

On postoperative days #20 and #16, she remained in sinus
rhythm.  She was awake and responsive.  She had decreased
breath sounds bilaterally, but her lungs were clear.  Her
sutures were intact in the sternum without drainage and with
minimal erythema and the area was not tender to palpation at
all.  The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains remained in place.  She had
extremity edema.  Her right saphenectomy site was clean, dry
and intact.  The patient was to have a plastic surgery follow
up in one week and see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in approximately one month.
She was to be discharged as soon as a rehabilitation bed was
available, but it was not available on that day.

The patient received a PICC catheter, which was placed on
[**2133-6-3**], as she was restarted on intravenous vancomycin at
the recommendation of the infectious disease service and she
continued to be seen by the physical therapy service and case
management as she awaited a bed placement at rehabilitation.

On postoperative days #22 and #18, the patient had successful
PICC line placement.  She had some serosanguinous drainage in
her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains with 76 cc in her first
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain and 50 cc in her second [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drain.  She was alert and responsive.  Her extremities were
warm and well perfused with 1+ edema.  Her sternal incision
was healing well.  Her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] sites had no erythema.
The right leg saphenectomy site was clean, dry and intact.
Her captopril was increased to 25 mg b.i.d.  Her oxygen was
