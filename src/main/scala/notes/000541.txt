Imaging:
CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary process

Brain MRI/MRA/MRV: Large, left basal ganglial hematoma, with
mild surrounding edema and compression on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the left lateral ventricle. No midline shift. No obvious
vascular lesions noted on the MRA/MRV. However, limited
assessment as lesions could be masked by the large hematoma. To
consider further evaluation after resolution of the hematoma. No
evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year old woman with uncontrolled HTN presents with headache
and right sided weakness. Initially taken to an OSH hospital
where a CT head showed a left basal ganglia hemorrhage,
prompting transfer to [**Hospital1 **]. Intubated and sedated prior to arrival
here. On initial examination, was sedated, did not follow any
commands. Pupils symmetrical, reactive. Right facial weakness;
no withdrawl to noxious stimuli on right arm. Feeble withdrawl
of right leg. Moves left arm and leg spontaneously. CT showed a
left basal ganglia/IC hemorrhage. MRI/A did not show any
vascular malformation. MRV normal. This was most likely a
hypertensive bleed given location and her history of
uncontrolled hypertension.

1. Neuro: She was intially admitted to the neuro ICU, but did
well and was extubated on [**2-21**]. Repeat CT done at that time
showed that the bleed was stable. Once off sedation, it was
clear that her mental status was essentially intact, except for
some paraphasias and dysarthria. She was titrated on captopril
to maintain blood pressure less than 160 in the acute setting.
She did well and was transferred out of the ICU to the Stroke
service. Her exam has slowly improved, and she has regained
nearly full strength in her legs, though she continues to be
esentially plegic in her right arm.

2. Cardiovascular:  She was ruled out for MI. Cholesterol
profile was excellent, with Chol 147, TG 334, HDL 58, LDL 22.
Hypertension was controlled with captopril. She was changed to
lisinopril for easier dosing once she had reached a stable dose.

3. Pulm: s/p Intubation for altered mental status. Was extubated
on [**2178-2-21**] and has had no further pulmonary issues.

4. ID: [**2-20**] U/A negative, repeat [**2-24**] dirty but grossly positive
associated with foley so started on Ciprofloxacin x 7 days.
Urine culture was positive for pansensitive E.coli and she
completed her 7 day course.

5. FEN: passed swallow evaluation, though was placed on soft
foods. She was started on thiamine/folate/MVI supplementation.
She is also s/p gap and nongap acidosis likely multifactorial
including ketoacidosis (in urine) [**1-30**] alcoholism and IVF. Gap
had normalized by [**2-25**].

She was also maintained on pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, as
well as a proton pump inhibitor and bowel medications.

At the time of discharge, her exam had improved. She is awake,
alert and attentive. She still makes occasional paraphasic
errors and still has dysarthria. She has a right facial droop, a
dense right arm plegia, and mild right leg weakness. She also
has decreased, though not absent, sensation on the right to all
modalities. Tone is increased on the right, requiring a
multipodus boot, with increased reflexes and upgoing toe.
