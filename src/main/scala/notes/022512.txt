History of Present Illness:
66-year-old male with MDS, normal pressure hydrocephalus, CAD,
HTN who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with neutropenic fever and
respiratory symptoms. He was admitted on [**2164-10-21**] with URI sx
with 2 days of sore throat and this progressed to a dry cough
and was fatigued. He was noted by his wife to be tired and
llethargic and mildly confused at 7am was found by his wife in
the bedroom after having knocked some things over after having
taken some cough syrup and complained off "dizziness" and was
put back into bed. His wife put him to bed and by 9am he was not
appropriately responsive and had the urge to urinate but was
unable to get off the bed and was mildly confused (does not
recall any of these events now and this history was from his
wife). Prior to the ambulance arriving his wife took his temp in
addition to the night before with no pyrexial epispiked noted.
on arrival to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED where initial VS were T 98.8, HR
90, BP 156/61, RR 20, O2 sat 90% on RA and he spiked a fever to
103 and was markedly confused and disoriented and was unable to
recognize his wife and daughter. CXR revealed no pneumonia
although a pulmonary vs line source was suspected (has a
Portacath) and therefore was commenced on IV vanc and cefepime
for febrile neutropenia.He received tylenol 650 mg PR, cefepime
2g IV and vancomycin infusion was started but not completed.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED vital signs were T 102, HR 91, BP
151/68, RR 16, O2 sat 94% 3L NC. On exam patient was A&O x 3,
but very slow and lethargic, taking 1.5 minutes to answer
orientation questions. His port-a-cath site was warm but not
erythematous. He was wheezing. Per report there was difficulty
accessing it. Lactate here was 1.7. Neurosurgery was consulted
and reviewed the CT head images from the OSH and felt that there
was no interval progression of the NPH. He received 1L NS,
vancomycin 1g IV, and nebs.
He was transferred to the ICU for close observation and CT was
unchanged from prior. His Portacath was warm but not
erythematous and did not appear cellulitic. There was however
some difficulty in accessing it. Head CT was reviewed by
neurosurgery
In ICU he was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics adding
azithromycin and he was investigated for possible causes with
rapid respiratory viral screen and a legionella urinary antigen
which were all negative. His confusion improved and he did not
have an LP. Azithromycin was stopped and he was continued on
vancomycin and cefepime with ciprofloxacin started for
additional Gram -ve coverage. His O/P neurologist was contact[**Name (NI) **]
regarding his admission in light of his NPH. repeat CXR on read
felt to be deem at the right base which were postulated to be
due to recent transfusion or drug reaction. Given a possibly new
murmur, he went. On to have a TTE which showed a mildly dilated
LA and EF 65-70% and was otherwise normal. There was no growth
to date on [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] cultures and a CMV VL is pending. On
[**10-22**], he developed [**1-8**] CP and had some T wave inversion on
telemetry in the setting of coming off O2 and arising to urinate
and this resolved with O2. His home anti-hypertensives we ere
restarted and cardiac enzymes were negative x2. He had further
chest pain at 03:26 on [**10-23**] and there was evidence at this time
of ST depressions and flipped T waves however ECG was unchanged.
This resolved with S/L nitroglycerine. Repeat CXR on [**10-23**] still
showed continued pulmonary congestive changes. The chest pain
was felt likely to be demand ischemia in the context of
infection and anemia - he has angina managed witty isosorbide
mononitrate at baseline. his lisinopril was gradually restarted.
By [**10-22**] his confusion had improved 85% and by [**10-23**] he was
pretty much back to his baseline. In addition he was found to be
diabetic on the ICU with high fingerstick blood sugars and an
HbA1c of 8.3%.
He had a profound thrombocytopenia and s last transfused on
[**10-21**] and was transfused 2 units of RCC on [**10-23**] due to a HCt of
19 in the setting of demand ischemia. On discussion with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
(neurology) and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 30635**] (neurosurgery) the plans for VP shunt
placement for his NPH have been deferred to [**Month (only) **] due to his
current infection.
On arrival to the BMT unit, his vitals were T 97.1 BP 142/72 HR
68 RR 16 sO2 100% RA. he currently feels well with no further
chest pain (states when he "over stresses" and when anaemic).
Still has a mild cough which has been unproductive. He has had
no deferasirox since being in hospital.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, + nasal congestion + chronic diarrhea related to
deferasirox. He has had no bowel movements since [**10-21**].
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness. Denies shortness of
breath or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, or
palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. Denies
dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.
Denies rashes or skin changes. No sweats or tremors.

Past Medical History:
CAD, s/p ant MI [**2139**], with hx LAD and RCA blockages. No stents
or angioplasties.
Angina - once weekly depending on anemia and stress levels
normally lasting 10-15 mins and resolves with nitro. Describes
as a squeezing central/left chest pain with no radiation usually
but can rarely will rarely feel in these locations. No
nausea/vomiting or sweating.
PVD
OSA on CPAP with morbid obesity
History of possible TIA [**2162**] ? CVA - had resolution of eye
position abnormalities over a few days
MDS with thrombocytopenia and anemia dx [**2159**]
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Asthma, cold-induced
s/p ruptured appendix
s/p right carotid endarterectomy several years ago
.
Hematologic Hx
longstanding history of myelodysplastic disorder
associated with severe pancytopenia, now red cell and platelet
transfusion requiring. Initially diagnosed [**2160-1-30**] when
his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], obtained a
complete blood countas a part of routine maintenance physical
examination. At that
time, he anemia, a low platelet count, and a borderline low
white
blood count. He was treated briefly with azacitidine (Vidaza)
with 4 cycles in [**State 108**] but his disease did not stabilize. He
has been getting PRBC's and platelet tranfusions, as well as
iron chelation with deferasirox (Exjade). There is current
discussion regarding his candidacy for BMT and it seems that the
general feeling is that a patient with his cardiac status would
be at too higher risk to go ahead with an allogeneic transplant
but there is currrent discussion with his cardiologist Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. In the past it has been felt that he was not a candidate
for any kind of stenting procedure because of his significant
thrombocytopenia
