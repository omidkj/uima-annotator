Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo female NH patient with chronic, indwelling foley, mental
retardation, recurrent osteomyelitis of thoracic spine s/p
fusion [**2136**], recurrent UTIs (recent adm [**2-27**] for urosepsis), DM,
HTN, presents from nursing home with nausea and vomiting found
to be in urosepsis and reported C diff colitis.
.
# Sepsis- urinary source - pt has indwelling foley catheter and
history of recurrent UTI; UA on admission has [**12-10**] WBC, many
bacteria, mod leuk, positive nitrites;  she has a ho of UTI w/
VRE and enterobacter and successfully treated with daptomycin
and imepenem; She was started on IV dapto and merepenem, added
cipro for double coverage of gram negatives initially;  Blood cx
and urine cx grew proteus species sensitive to merepenem; Dapto
was discontinued.  She was initially started on levophed and IVF
bolus to maintain CVP 8 and MAP 60, and she was started on
vasopressin on [**2137-5-4**] and weaned off the levophed on the same
day, and vasopressin was discontinued 24hrs after that. Pt. was
unable to tolerate PICC placement, and given that pt. has only 3
days left of meropenem it was decided to finish this course,
then remove her CVL at [**Hospital1 1501**].
.
# likely C diff colitis - reported C diff positive on [**2137-4-29**],
not on treatment, multiple C diff ho; with elevated WBC of 25 on
admission; she presented w/ N/V (emesis guiac negative); abd
exam unreliable; reported last BM [**4-29**]; KUB very poor quality;
CXR no free air; She was started on PO flagyl; C diff was
negative x 2, although her WBC came down nicely with PO flagyl,
will continue for 14 day course.
.
# lactic acidosis - pt is Diabetic, initial UA showed no
ketones, no glucose; blood lactate level elevated likely in the
setting of sepsis; attempted ABG, but pt consistantly refused
and became agitated overnight, VBG showed 7.27/48/52/23 and
lactate trending down w/ fluids and abx treatment overnight;
continue treatment of her infections as above; her acidosis
improved.
.
# hypotension - likely from her sepsis, intially on IVF bolus
and levophed titration to keep MAP 60 and CVP8 which was weaned
off; continue treatment of her infection as above; hold bblocker
initially, which was restarte at low dose 12.5mg PO bid for PAF
control. Sent to [**Hospital1 1501**] on her regular toprol dose as hypotension
resolved.
.
# DM - continued her lantus and SSI, FS QID
.
# PAF - pt has known history of afib on bblocker for rate
control, no on anticoagulation given ho of SDH;  She was
initailly NSR, and given her hypotension, her bblocker was
intially held; had two episodes of AFib w/ RVR on [**2137-5-4**]
controlled with IV lopressor 5mg x 1, or IV dilt 10mg x 1;  once
her hypotension resolved, she was restarted on low dose
bblocker.
.
# ARF - Cr on admission 3.6 up from baseline 0.9 -1.0; likely
prerenal in the setting of dehydration; continue IVFs, and Cr
gradually improved.
.
# hypothyroidism - continue synthroid home dose; last free T4
0.4 in [**10-26**]; recheck TSH in the am low; free T4 0.92

# multiple skin ulcers - continue routine wound care and wound
cx sent; wound care consulted
.
# Anemia - baseline Hct 26-28, initial Hct on admission was 37,
most likely in the setting of hemoconcentration in the setting
of dehydration; now Hct back to baseline this am after fluid
resuscitation; received 2 units of pRBCs on [**2137-5-4**] for a hct
drop to 22; checked iron panel and B12; Fe supplement was d/c'ed
on [**2137-5-5**] and continued Vit B12, epo treatment.
.
FEN: intially NPO give N/V and IVF bolus and maintenance;
gradually started Diabetasource at 70cc/hr continuously through
PEJ, can tolerates po fluids. Loves diet ginger ale with ice.
