History of Present Illness:
79M PMH CHF EF 20%, CAD, COPD, dementia transferred from [**Location (un) 54655**] NH with hypoxia 60% - patient initially placed on NRB but
titrated down and 100% on 2L evaluation by EMT. The patient had
complained of epigastric/right-sided abdominal pain x 24 hours
per NH records. The patient complained of left sided CP x 5
minutes to EMT, resolving without intervention.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T: 97.0 BP: 98/46 HR: 58 RR: 36 O2sat:
98%RA.
Temperature rose to 102.2 (rectal) and SBP drifted down to 70s.
Patient was given NS x 3L, started on peripheral dopamine
(13cc/hr - 5ucg/kg). WBC 14.9 with 97% neutrophils, lactate 4.1,
INR 7.8. Patient was given vitamin K 10 mg IV and FFP x 2 units.
CT torso showed findings consistent with acute cholecystitis,
small left-sided pleural effusion. Patient given
ceftriaxone/azithromycin/ vancomycin/flagyl. EKG V-paced but new
TWI V2-V6. Cardiology was consulted and felt the EKG was
concerning. Patient was given ASA, and as coumadin was
supratherapeutic, no heparin was given. UA negative and guaiac
negative at that time.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient [**Location (un) **] any pain. ROS limited by
dementia.

2. Calcified outpouching at the aortic isthmus without evidence
of mediastinal hemorrhage or intramural hematoma, unchanged
since prior study.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason: r/o bleed
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old man with dementai and [**Last Name (un) 54656**] TWI on EKG concerning for
bleed
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 79-year-old man with dementia and T-wave inversion
on EKG concerning for bleed.
COMPARISON: [**2181-4-30**] and [**2181-4-27**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.
FINDINGS: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift
of normally midline structures is noted. There are no acute
major vascular territorial infarcts. Moderately severe
prominence of sulci and the ventricles compatible with
age-associated involutionary changes is evident. Osseous
structures are unremarkable. No acute fractures are noted.
Visualized soft tissue structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Septic shock/cholecystitis: Resolving. On admission, met
criteria for septic shock given temperature >38.5??????C and WBC
count of >12,000 cells/mL; lactate >2 mmol/L; systemic mean BP
of <60 mm Hg and need for dopamine. Source was most likely
biliary given CT findings and gram negative rod bacteremia.
Patient was seen by surgery who felt he was not a surgical
candidate.  The patient initially required brief p
