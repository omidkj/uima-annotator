Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Sulfonamides

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
confusion, aphasia, right facial droop

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT/CTA head and neck
iv-tPA

History of Present Illness:
Ms.  [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of Afib (not on
coumadin), prior strokes ([**2131**], [**2133**]) details of which are
unknown, HTN and recent right arm fracture and osteotomy who
developed "confusion", decreased verbal output and right facial
droop this AM at her NH.  She was well this AM until she went to
the bathroom at the NH just before 8:00AM.  At that time, she
was
noted to have decreased verbal output (which is unusual for her)
completely non-verbal with a right facial droop.  EMS was called
and she arrived in the ER at 9:50AM. She was initially evaluated
by the stroke fellow who found her to be awake, non- verbal,
following simple commands, with right facial droop and right
hemiparesis. Her initial NIHSS was 12. She had a CT Scan at
which
showed no evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. CTA showed no
large branch occlusions in the intracranil circulation.  She was
given IV t-PA at 11:00 AM, 3 hours after symptom onset.

Neck: supple, no carotid bruit
CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs
Lung: +left basilar crackles, decreased BS at right base
aBd: +BS soft, nontender

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, unable to state name, follows
simple, one step midline and appendicular commands.  Practically
non-verbal, though tries to initiate speech; occasionally able
to
say yes or no. Unable to repeat single words or name any items.
Does not appear to understand complex commands or questions.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2mm
bilaterally.
Visual fields appear full to threat (could not comply with
confrontation testing). Extraocular movements intact bilaterally
without nystagmus. Sensation to noxious appears intact V1-V3.
Right facial droop.  Tongue deviated to right (? due to facial).
Tongue midline without fasciculations, intact movements

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone slightly increased in right LE. No
adventitious movements. Unable to comply with formal motor
testing, but could hold left arm and leg antigravity and right
leg antigravity for >10 seconds.  Moved Right UE on the bed (at
least [**1-23**]).

Sensation: Withdraws to pinch in all 4 extremities.

Reflexes:

Right 2 2  *   2   2
Left  2 2  2   2   2
Rflxs slightly more brisk on the right
Toes were downgoing bilaterally

Coordination: Unable to assess (pt doesn't appear to understand
task)


Pertinent Results:
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2145-5-2**] 11:12 AM
FINDINGS: Abnormal diffusion is noted in the posterior left
frontal lobe in the precentral gyrus region, consistent with
acute stroke.
Subacute/chronic infarct is noted in the right cerebellar region
as evidenced by abnormal signal on T2 and FLAIR images with
shine through artifact on diffusion-weighted images.
Patchy areas of hyperintensity are noted in the periventricular
deep white matter consistent with a small vessel disease.
A punctate area of susceptibility abnormality is noted in the
right cerebellum, may represent tiny calcification versus tiny
punctate hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION:
1) Acute infarct is noted in the left posterior frontal lobe.
2) Subacute/chronic infarct noted in the right cerebellum.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2145-4-30**] 10:30 AM
COMPARISON: [**2145-3-25**].
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally
midline structures, or hydrocephalus. The ventricles and sulci
remain enlarged, consistent with atrophy. There is low
attenuation of the periventricular white matter consistent with
chronic microvascular infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation remains intact. There is no evidence of a new
major vascular territorial infarct. The osseous structures are
normal. There are several right maxillary sinus mucosal
retention cysts versus polyps.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or change in the
appearance of the brain. Please note that an MRI with
diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for detection of an
acute infarct.

Brief Hospital Course:
After IV-tPA administration Pt was observied in the Neurological
ICU x48 hours during which time there was limited improvement in
her presenting symptoms.  She was transferred to the general
Inpatient Stroke Service where bedside swallowing evaluation
proved her incompetent to handle PO but unfortunately would not
allow for NG-tube placement.  In addition, prior to discharge
she was evaluated by Speech Pathology.  After some discussion
with the family and medical care team, the decision was made to
transfer to an extened care facility for further care.
