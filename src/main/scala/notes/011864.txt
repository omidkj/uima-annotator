Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old
gentleman with a history of alcohol abuse and alcohol-induced
cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, and upper gastrointestinal
bleed secondary to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs who
was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2113-10-25**] with
atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response.

It was thought at this time that he was in acute alcohol
withdrawal.  He was treated with diltiazem given by
intravenous bolus and by drip for rate control and Ativan
with withdrawals.  He subsequently developed facial edema and
airway edema requiring emergent intubation for airway
protection.  It is unclear at this time what the initial
precipitant was for possible angioedema.  He also received
Protonix at one point during hs hospitalization there.

The patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] to the
[**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care Unit on
[**11-2**] for further management.

At [**Hospital1 69**], the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course was significant for group G streptococcus
sepsis; possibly from a cellulitic skin source which has been
treated with ceftriaxone.  He developed hypotension and
required a short course of Neo-Synephrine.  His atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response was eventually
treated with digoxin with good rate control.  He
spontaneously converted into a normal sinus rhythm during his
hospital course.

His Intensive Care Unit course was also notable for delta
multiple sclerosis thought to be secondary to hepatic
encephalopathy with a minimal response to rectal lactulose.
He also developed a left lung collapse secondary to mucous
plugging.  The patient received bronchoscopy two times with
aggressive suctioning on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] with
eventual re-expansion of his left lower lobe.  He failed a
Speech and Swallow evaluation after he was extubated on
[**2113-11-11**].  He was also noted to have some trouble
with his cough and had a hoarse voice after extubation,
thought to be residual from his angioedema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Alcohol abuse with a history of alcohol withdrawal
seizures and hallucinosis.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed thought secondary to
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use.
4.  Chronic back pain.
5.  Anxiety.
6.  Alcohol-induced cirrhosis.
7.  Interatrial septal aneurysms.
8.  Chronic deep venous thrombosis with collaterals.
9.  Hepatitis B and hepatitis C negative at outside hospital.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  (From Intensive Care Unit)
1.  Digoxin 0.1 mg by mouth once per day
2.  Pepcid 20 mg by mouth twice per day.
3.  Lactulose 300 mg per rectum twice per day.
4.  Albuterol as needed.
5.  Miconazole powder.
6.  Ceftriaxone (day 10 as of [**2113-11-12**]).
7.  Tylenol.
8.  Vitamin K times three.

ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN, DILTIAZEM, and ATIVAN are questioned for
anaphylaxis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is homeless.  He lives in a
shelter.  His cousin is his health care proximally, and he
has a sister who lives in [**Name (NI) 108**] with whom he is not in
communication.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On physical
examination, vital signs were stable with a temperature of
98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 92/38, his
respiratory rate was 22, and his oxygen saturation was 95% on
2 liters nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was a
middle-aged gentleman who was alert.  He had some garbled
speech and was nonsensical at times.  He had a hoarse voice.
The lungs had rhonchi bilaterally but greater on the right
than on the left.  He had 1+ pedal edema and proximal muscle
wasting.  He had some dilated veins of his upper thorax.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Significant
laboratory data revealed the patient's platelet count was 42
(which was stable during his hospitalization).  His mean cell
volume was 101.  His Chemistry-7 was normal.  His INR was
1.7, prothrombin time was 15.9, and partial thromboplastin
time was 29.9.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An echocardiogram from [**11-2**] showed an ejection fraction of 60% to 70%.  No interatrial
septal defects.  Normal left ventricular and right
ventricular function.  Mitral regurgitation of 2+ and 1+
tricuspid regurgitation.  Trace pericardial effusions.  No
vegetations were seen on transesophageal echocardiogram.

On [**11-3**], a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed an
echogenic liver consistent with cirrhosis and a hyperechoic
lesion in the posterior right lobe.  There was small free
fluid around the liver and some cholelithiasis.  No ductal
dilatation or gallbladder wall thickening was seen on
ultrasound.

A chest x-ray from [**11-12**] showed a patchy retrocardiac
density and a slight increase in atelectasis.

On [**11-11**], an upper extremity ultrasound showed a chronic
occlusion of right internal jugular with collateralization.
Acute thrombus about the brachial vein with normal flow
through the second brachial vein.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  In
brief, the patient is a 44-year-old gentleman with a history
of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, and a prolonged admission to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for alcohol withdrawal,
complicated by anaphylaxis to possibly diltiazem versus
Ativan or Protonix, and group B streptococcus sepsis.  He
also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response, hypotension, and mucous plugging.

The patient was transferred to the regular medical floor on
[**2113-11-12**].

1.  HYPOXIA ISSUES:  The patient's cough continued to improve
during his hospital stay.  He had no further episodes of
desaturations, and he was able to clear his secretions.

A chest x-ray on [**11-16**] showed interval improvement of
the left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with clear
lung fields.

2.  DELTA MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ISSUES:  The patient was noted
to have some delirium status post his Intensive Care Unit
stay.  This continued to clear each day and was thought to be
multifactorial with an element of hypoxia, hepatic
encephalopathy, and alcohol-induced encephalopathy causing
his change in mental status.

He had a head computed tomography that was negative for any
acute bleed or mass; although there was note of a
calcification in the left frontoparafalcine region measuring
6 mm in its greatest dimension which was thought to be
related to angioma, although of unclear etiology.  He also
was noted to have mild brain atrophy on a head computed
tomography.

By the time of discharge, the patient was able to engage in
conversation appropriately and follow commands.

3.  ANGIOEDEMA ISSUES:  Since the angioedema was not
witnessed during this hospitalization, it was unclear at this
time whether he actually had an episode of angioedema.

The Allergy Service was consulted and they suggested that the
patient have a re-challenge of Ativan an diltiazem as an
outpatient.  Thyroid studies were sent here which showed a
normal thyroid-stimulating hormone and a free T4.  His C4
level was within normal limits, and his C1 level was an out
of hospital study which was still pending.

It appeared highly unlikely that the patient developed
angioedema secondary to Ativan since he has received Ativan
multiple times in the past without any adverse reactions.

4.  GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS SEPSIS ISSUES:  The patient was to
complete a 21-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone as per
Infectious Disease consultation.  As of today's dictation,
the patient was on day 16/21.  All surveillance cultures have
been negative thus far.  After the patient has completed his
course of antibiotics, he should have surveillance cultures
drawn as an outpatient.

5.  PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient is
now in a sinus rhythm; although, it appears that he is at
high risk for having recurrent atrial fibrillation given that
his left atrium was enlarged on an echocardiogram done at
this institution.  However, given his alcohol abuse and
current unsteady gait, the patient was at a high risk for
falls.  Will continu
