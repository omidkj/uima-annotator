History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with DM, HTN, elevated cholesterol s/p
witnessed cardiopulmonary arrest.  Per patients wife, he was in
his usual state of health, working as an EMT, able to climb
multiple flights of stairs until [**2104-8-6**] when he felt nauseated
and diaphoretic with chills.  He went to sleep and then began to
have agonal breathing at 1AM and rolled onto his right side.  He
was unresponsive for 5-10 minutes and then his wife called EMS.
When they arrived he was pulseless, AED was attached and 2
shocks were given, patient was still pulseless and CPR was
started.  He received 2 more AED shocks which restored pulse and
breathing.  Patient was transiently hypotensive to SBP of 60.
He was given 4 liters NS, lidocaine, heparin and dopamine drip.
He was intubated for airway protection with pancuronium.   ECG
with RBBB/LAFB, Afib with RVR.  Labs notable for WBC of 11.9
with 20% bandemia.  CK 573, TN-I 0.29.  Patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU.

IMAGING:
.
CXR [**2104-8-7**]:
1) The ET tube is in good position.
2) Cardiomegaly.
3) Left lower lobe consolidation vs. atelectasis. The
differential diagnosis include aspiration in this patient with
cardiac arrest.
4) Plate-like atelectasis in the left mid lung zone.
5) Questionable pulmonary edema. This could be better evaluated
with an
repeat chest radiograph.
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2104-8-7**]:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is
no shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles,
cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable. There is preservation of
the grey-white differentiation. There is mucosal thickening in
the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
ECHO [**2104-8-7**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction
20-30 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
ECHO [**2104-8-11**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall systolic function is normal. Left
Ventricle - Ejection Fraction >= 55%.  Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity
dilation but preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2104-8-7**], there
has been a marked improvement in left ventricular systolic
function (the ventricular rate isalso slower)
.
EEG [**2104-8-11**]:
BACKGROUND: Is a markedly low voltage 8 Hz alpha frequency
rhythm.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed due to the patient's
clinical
condition.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed because
this
was a portable study.
SLEEP: Normal transitions of the sleep architecture were not
seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Initially, there was a normal sinus rhythm with
a rate
of 72 bpm with intermittent ventricular ectopies. In addition,
there
are two episodes where the ventricular rhythm showed the sudden
onset of
a left bundle branch block which lasted for 30-60 seconds and
then
reverted to a normal conduction pattern.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is with in normal limits but shows a low
voltage background with excessive drowsiness. No lateralizing
or epileptiform abnormalities were seen. Two episodes of a
change from
normal cardiac ventricular conduction to one with a left bundle
branch
block were noted.
.
EKG [**2104-8-7**]:
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Left axis
deviation with left anterior fascicular block. Mild inferior
ST-T wave changes which are non-specific. Low QRS voltage in the
preordial leads.
.
EKG [**2104-8-10**]:
Probable idioventricular rhythm or accelerated idioventricular
rhythm, rate 87,with retrograde P waves.
.
EKG [**2104-8-16**]:
Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing of [**2104-8-11**] atrial
fibrillation is no longer present and the Q-T interval has
increased.
.
LEFT LE DOPPLERS [**2104-8-8**]:
IMPRESSION: Negative left lower extremity DVT study.

Brief Hospital Course:
# s/p CP arrest: Reports were obtained from EMTs and Town of
[**Location (un) **] Police Department.  Patient was determined to be in
polymorphic VT and VF and after receiving AED shocks X4, he was
converted to atrial fibrillation and started on lidocaine drip
in the field.  When he arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] the lidocaine was
discontinued and he was loaded on amiodarone.  He continued to
have occasional runs of AIVR and afib, but after 10 days in the
hospital, he reverted to stable NSR and was continued on
amiodarone 400 mg QD.  Reports from [**Hospital6 20592**] show the patient had an ETT-MIBI on [**2103-12-24**] which
showed: "Reversible anterior wall defect, partially reversible
defects of the inferior and apical walls consistent with
ischemia and scarring, EF is 44%," without revascularization,
making ischemic injury likely as the initiating event for the
arrest.
.
# CAD: Patient was started on empiric aspirin, atorvastatin and
a heparin drip.
He was hypertensive on admission and was put on a Nitro drip, he
was then converted to medications per NG/PEG tube.  His
discharge antihypertensive regimen includes: metoprolol 100 mg
TID, hydralazine 100 mg QID, lisinopril 20 mg [**Hospital1 **], lasix 40 mg
[**Hospital1 **], and isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg TID.
.
# Pump: EF 20-30% on initial admission ECHO, repeat ECHO on [**8-11**]
showed improvement in EF to greater than 55%, mild LVH with
moderate dilation, no AR, trivial MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 30983**] systolic function
is normal.  Lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] maintained the patient
