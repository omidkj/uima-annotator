Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
change in mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
PEG placement

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 83 yo gentleman with PMHx sig for HTN, skin cancer NOS,
and sleep apnea who fell down four stairs at home today. EMS was
called and the patient was intubated due to combativeness.  He
was brought to an OSH where a head CT showed a
large L temporal ICH, intraventricular hemorrhage, L SDH, and
SAH.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  Mechanism of fall unclear.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2127-12-31**]:
FINDINGS:There is a acute subdural hematoma which surrounds the
left
cerebral hemisphere which measures up to 9 mm in thickness.
Subdural blood
layers along the left tentorium. Blood is noted in the left
quadrigeminal
cistern and surrounding the left cerebral peduncle and within
left portion
of the suprasellar cistern. There is subarachnoid hemorrhage
along the left
cerebral hemisphere spanning the frontal and temporal lobes
primarily. There is also subarachnoid blood on the right noted
in the right sylvian fissure specifically. There is increase in
parenchymal contusion in the left temporal lobe with surrounding
edema and sulcal effacement noted. Areas of pneumocephalus are
again noted in the left middle cranial fossa.
Intraventricular hemorrhage is noted primarily in the left
lateral ventricle and a small amount is noted to layer in the
right lateral ventricle occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. There is no increase in
ventricular size when compared with prior study hough there is
now approximately 4 mm of rightward subfalcine herniation which
may be increased. There is no evidence of downward
transtentorial herniation though there is some relative
hypodensity in the left cerebral peduncle which may reflect
edema. Overall, the most notable difference since the prior
study is the increase in left temporal lobe hemorrhagic
contusion and the surrounding edema.

Impression:
1. Increased hemorrhagic contusion in left temporal lobe with
resultant surrounding edema. No significant change in left
cerebral subdural hematoma and extensive subarachnoid
hemorrhage.
2. Partial opacification of left mastoid air cells and the left
middle ear cavity raising concern for left temporal bone fx. The
presence of pneumocephalus in the left middle cranial fossa also
suggests an underlying fracture.

HEAD AND NECK CTA [**1-1**]: The carotid and vertebral arteries and
their major
branches are patent. In particular, the left MCA is patent
without evidence
of stenosis, but this does not exclude ischemia. There is a mild
narrowing ofthe basilar artery, most likely secondary to
atherosclerotic plaque. The
diamter of The distal cervical internal carotid arteries
measures 7 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left. There is no
evidence of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.

MPRESSION:
1. No interval change of the multiple intracranial hemorrhage
and hematomas. Persistent mass effect with a rightward shift of
midline structures.
2. No evidence of aneurysm. Mild narrowing of basilar artery.
Left MCA
patent, but this does not exclude ischemia.
3. Persistent hypodensity extending to the cortex, approximating
the left MCA distribution. Question remains if parenchymal edema
is secondary to
infarction or contusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo gentleman with PMHx sig for HTN, skin cancer NOS, and
sleep apnea who fell down four stairs at home. EMS was called
and the patient was intubated due to combativeness.  He was
brought to an OSH where a head CT showed a large L temporal ICH,
intraventricular hemorrhage, L SDH, and SAH.  The patient was in
SICU during most of the hospital course. The patient's poor
prognosis for a meaningful recovery was discussed with the
family and no brain intervention was performed. Patient was made
DNR. He was not improving and the family decided to make the
patient comfort measures only on [**1-7**]. He was extubated and
later transferred to the floor. He was placed on a morphine
drip. Palliative care recommended a changed in the pain regimen
and also recommended giving him medication for his secretions.
The patient was kept comfortable. His family was with him on
[**1-8**] when he expired at 5 pm. They did not want an autopsy.
