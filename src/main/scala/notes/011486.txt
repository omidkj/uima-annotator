PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 98, heart rate 87,
blood pressure 159/85, 96% on 4 liters, respiratory rate 16.
He was an obese male in no acute distress, awake, alert,
breathing comfortable, in no respiratory distress.  Sclerae
anicteric.  Mucous membranes moist.  Neck supple, no
lymphadenopathy.  Poor air movement with decreased breath

LABORATORY DATA:  UA showed greater than 1000 glucose, but
was negative for white cells, nitrites, leukocytes.  He was
ruled out for MI.  He had a white count of 12.6, hematocrit
32.5, platelets 259.  BUN and creatinine were 23 and 0.7.
Glucose 270.  Chemistries otherwise normal.  He had three
sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  EKG showed low voltage,
sinus rhythm at 94, no ST changes.  Chest x-ray showed
bullous emphysematous changes bilateral upper lobes, but no
acute pathology.  No obstruction or perforation on KUB.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was ruled out for MI and, according
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2450**], his primary care doctor, he often presented with
chest pain in the setting of COPD exacerbation.  Patient was
continued on his prednisone taper.  Given his cough and his
bandemia, he was started on azithromycin for bronchitis.  He
did well, but continued to have some nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea.  Stool studies were negative.  This was felt to be
viral gastroenteritis.  On [**1-10**] patient felt better,
reported resolution of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and
asked to be discharged home.  Patient was getting ready to go
home and had a large lunch and again felt nauseous and
vomited and felt the need to have a bowel movement.  He went
into the bathroom and at that time his oxygen tank ran out,
patient became hypoxic, had some jerking of his right arm and
unresponsiveness for 10 seconds, but immediately came to and
was oriented times three.  After that episode he was given
nonrebreather mask 100%.  His O2 sat came up to 98% to 100%.

He was stabilized and resting and was weaned off the
nonrebreather mask, placed back on nasal cannula oxygen of 4
liters, doing well, but spiked a temperature to 102 and
proceeded to be tachypneic and anxious and became hypoxic.
At that time ABG showed that patient was hypercarbic with CO2
of 77 and O2 of 57.  He was given nonrebreather mask with
improvement in his respiratory rate and his O2 sat.  Repeat
ABG showed pH of 7.26, CO2 85, PO2 83.  Due to patient's
hypercarbia, he was transferred to the intensive care unit
for BiPAP treatment given that patient refused intubation.
Patient was unable to tolerate BiPAP overnight and was
maintained on 4 to 5 liters nasal cannula with good O2 sat.
He remained stable.  On the second night patient again tried
BiPAP for 20 minutes, but was unable to tolerate it in the
intensive care unit.  Repeat chest x-ray showed interval
worsening of bibasilar atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions could not be excluded.  There was a question of
possible aspiration pneumonia given patient's recent episode
of nausea, vomiting and loss of consciousness.  He was
started on levofloxacin for pneumonia and given Solu-Medrol
IV 80 mg t.i.d. and remained stable throughout the MICU
course.

He was then transferred back to the medical service on the
floor.  He continued to do well.  He was started on his
prednisone taper, continued on levofloxacin, remained
afebrile with resolution of nausea, vomiting, sating 95% to
98% on 4 liters of oxygen.  During this course patient
reiterated his wish to be DNR/DNI.  He was also counseled on
dietary modifications as well as compliance with his
medications.  He was discharged home with VNA to follow up
for medication teaching as well as for home safety
evaluation.
