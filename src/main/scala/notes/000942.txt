Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted and started on IV AUnasyn, NPO, IVF. A CT
abdomen was performed to R/O biloma fromation which showed the
following:
No drainable fluid collections. Post surgical changes in the
gallbladder fossa. Calcified densities in the posterior liver,
below the level of the diaphragm/? calcified granulomas,
Prostatic enlargement, and small bilateral pleural effusions.

A HIDA scan was obtained on HD #2 which showed no evidence of
extravasation.  The ostomy bag draining bilious fluid over the R
post site steadily decreased throughout the [**Hospital **] hospital stay.
TB of the fluid was measured at the beginning and at the end of
the hospital course measuring 6.9 and 2.1 respectiveley.  The
pt's LFT's and PE were monitored throughout his stay and his
LFT's steadily improved throughout his hospital stay.  (see lab
result section).  With the pt's clinical improvement post
stenting and review of his cholab=ngiogram, it was thought that
the leak was most likely from the cystic duct stump.

The [**Hospital **] hospital course was remarkable for diarrhea.  CDIFF was
sent and was negative X 3.

The pt tolerated a regular diet, was voiding on his own,
abulating without difficulty, and had stable VS and an
unremarkable PE upon discharge. The pt was cleared by physicial
therapy and was DC'd on prophalyctic antibiotics
(ciprofloxacin)and with VNA for drain care.  The pt preferred to
have his follow up care done through the VA system but was to
return for a repeat ERCP in approximately 10 days.
