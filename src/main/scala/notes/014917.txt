Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 55 yo F with h/o remote etoh abuse, colon
cancer, treated in [**2141**]-[**2142**] with resection and chemotherapy,
complicated by cirrhosis. She has had no evidence recurrence on
imaging including PET scan, but CEAs have been trending upward
(thought to be due to liver inflammation).
.
Pt admitted intially on [**8-27**] for shortness of breath, AMS,
confusion, lethargy x 48hrs thought to be hepatic
encephalopathy, given elevated ammonia, treated with Lactulose.
Also given fluids, dopamine, Levo/Vanco for hypotension. On
[**8-30**], pt developed respiratory distress and hypoxemia, was
intubated and treated for ARDS. Pt improved and vent was weaned
but pt's mental status did not improve with removal of sedation.
She was worked up with EEG (toxic metabolic slowing), head CT
(negative), Neuro consult (brain stem reflexes intact but
decreased higher cortical function. Considered etiologies
remained hepatic encephalopathy with ongoing treatment with
Lactulose and Rifaximin and good stooling response, as well as
slowed clearance of sedating medications used while intubated
given obesity. Pt continued to have daily spontaneous breathing
trials which she passed easily but given mental status was
maintained on minimal ventilator support and was trached on
[**9-17**] with Shiley trach. Pt repeatedly sedated with propofol and
ativan drip given agitation and fighting of vent.
.
Course also complicated by recurrent fevers to 101-102. All
cultures negative, including lines (central line pulled last
week). Bronchoscopy negative except [**Female First Name (un) **]. No evidence of
ascites on US or abd scans. Gallbladder was shown to be enlarged
and PCBD was placed on [**9-2**], ultimatelly gram stain negative and
no WBCs, 1wk later grew staph and thought to be contaminant.
Received off and on broad antibiotics, ultimately on Linezolid
and Aztreonam restarted on [**9-19**].
.
[**Name (NI) **], pt persistently had normal renal function (Cr 0.7-1)
and good urine output, until day of transfer when Cr bumped to
1.5 and pt developed hematuria.
.
Other issues have been persistent thrombocytopenia (60s-120s),
coagulopathy (INR 1.5-1.7, no bleeding). Given h/o gastric lap
banding, surgery had to release band for OG placement.

.

pneumonitis or ARDS. Extensive perivascular anterior mediastinal
nodes stable.

[**2145-9-21**] Abdomen U/S

IMPRESSION:

1) Cholecystostomy tube not visualized.

2) Soft tissue thickening anterior to the anterior surface of
the liver which
could represent omental metastases in light of history of colon
carcinoma as
suggested by OMR note, although the PET scan was reported as
negative. Repaet
CT scan may be of value.

3) Mild splenomegaly.

4) No source of sepsis identified.

[**2145-9-21**] CT head
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Paranasal sinus minor inflammatory disease, and partial
fluid-
opacification of the mastoid air cells, some of which may relate
to
intubation.

[**2145-9-21**] CT abdomen
IMPRESSION:
1. Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube adjacent to a collapsed
gallbladder. It
is unclear whether the tip is barely within the collapsed
gallbladder or just
out side. As the tube was not visualized on ultrasound this is
concerning for
tube malpositioning. Further evaluation with tube cholangiogram
under
fluoroscopy is recommended.
2. No evidence of omental mass or thickening in the upper
abdomen (note that
the pelvis was not imaged)
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Trace amount of perihepatic fluid.
5. Bibasilar pulmonary consolidations. Considerations include
atelectasis
and/or infection and these must be placed in clinical context.

[**2145-9-22**] Spinal fluid
Cerebrospinal fluid (LP):

  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

  Many lymphocytes and monocytes.

[**2145-9-23**] MRI head
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intracranial mass or abnormal enhancement.
2. Diffuse thickening of the calvarium with decrease dsignal-
nonspeciifc
finding and can be seen with anemia, myeloproliferative or
infiltrative
malignancies/disorders- to correlate with labs.

3. Diffuse mucosal thickening/ fluid within bilateral mastoid
air cells.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

[**2145-9-24**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG study due to
slowing and
disorganization of the background activity. These findings
suggest a
moderate encephalopathy involving cortical and subcortical
structures.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are the
most
common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing
although
encephalopathies can obscure focal findings. No epileptiform
feature
