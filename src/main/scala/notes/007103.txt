History of Present Illness:
This is a 86 year old female with PMH significant for known
CAD(prior IMI [**2111**]), who was transferred from OSH after episode
BRBPR, weakness/malaise, acute renal insufficiency,
hyperkalemia, and elevated cardiac enzymes. She was in her USOH
(which is occasional weakness and she reports recent difficulty
ambulating due to "soreness") until this past week when she felt
weaker than usual. At the OSH, her BP was found to be 80s
systolic to 115. CK was 257 in the setting of this hypotension
and MB was 20 with a Troponin of 1.24. She was transferred from
the ER to the CCU for ?NSTMI and transient hypotension and
weakness. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] she was found to be
hemodynamically stable, mentating well with no symptoms. She was
subsequently transferred to the floor.  The patient additionally
relates one week of lethargy, with her ??????legs weak,?????? but it
appears often that she has found it more difficult to get out of
bed. On detailed ROS, she denies any feverishness, and relates 2
days of diarrhea ??????but I didn??????t see any blood!?????? No cough /
dysuria, or other concern for infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 109217**] was admitted under cardiology with NSTEMI. An
echocardiogram on [**4-18**] showed 3+ mitral regurgitation and
mild LV dysfunction with an LVEF of 45%. Her recent myocardial
infarction was most likely the result of transient hypotension
which also resulted in acute renal insufficiency and hepatic
ischemia. She remained guaiac negative and her liver and renal
function gradually improved. She remained pain free on medical
therapy. Colonoscopy on [**4-22**] was only notable for small
internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal. She subsequently
underwent cardiac catheterization on [**4-23**] which revealed
biventricular diastolic dysfunction and severe three vessel
coronary artery disease which included left main disease. Based
upon the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted for
surgical revascularization and potential mitral valve
repair/replacement. Further evaluation included dental clearance
and carotid non invasive studies which showed only mild disease
of internal carotid arteries. Her preoperative course was
otherwise uneventful and she was cleared for surgery.

On [**4-27**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a mitral valve repair and
coronary artery bypass grafting. Following the operation, she
was brought to the CSRU in stable condition. Her postoperative
course was complicated by acute renal failure and mesenteric
ischemia. She required CVVHD and underwent subtotal colectomy
and terminal ileum colon resection on postoperative day three.
Abdominal arteriogram at time of colectomy confirmed severe
spasm of the superior mesenteric artery and findings consistent
with low flow state. She remained in critical condition. TPN was
started for nutritional support. She continued to require CVVHD
and inotropic support. Her platelet count dropped as low as 16k
and she was diagnosed with heparin induced thrombocytopenia with
a postive heparin PF4 antibody assay. Her thrombocytopenia was
multifactorial in etiology. She was eventually started on
Bivalirudin to prevent thromobotic complications. Despite
medical therapies, her clinical status progressively
deteriorated. She became acidotic with no improvement in renal
and liver function. She became more and more pressor dependent
and displayed no signs of improvment. After discussions with the
family, it was decided to make her a DNR. She eventually expired
on [**5-8**].
