Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission he underwent imaging that demonstrated a
bleed into the nonfunctining transplanted kidney, and
extravasation of contrast from a lumbar artery.  The presumed
mechanism was that of the expanding hematoma avulsing the
artery.

He was taken to the Interventional Radiology suite where coiling
and embolization of the renal and lumbar bleeding diatheses was
undertaken.  He stabilized , was hemodynamically stable and
weaned and extubated.  He was subsequently transferred to the
floor where he recovered.

He continued hemodialysis and was seen by Physical Therapy for
mobility.  He was walking with his [**Month/Day/Year **] and ready for
discharge on [**12-9**] home with Caregroup VNA.  Arrangem
