Service:  [**Company 191**]

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pancreatic cancer.
2.  Cholangitis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pancreatic cancer.
2.  Cholangitis.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
female with a history of pancreatic cancer diagnosed two weeks
prior to admission who presents with right upper quadrant pain.
The patient had an ERCP performed on [**2144-6-9**] to evaluate for
painless jaundice times one week. On ERCP, an obstructing mass
was visualized at the ampulla of VATER and a sphincterostomy was
performed and a stent was placed in the biliary tree.  Cytology
was sent and was rediagnosed with adenocarcinoma.  The patient
was determined to be nonoperable.  The patient was discharged to
a nursing home status post the procedure.

From the nursing home, the patient had a short stay at
rehabilitation and back to the nursing home on the day prior
to admission where she developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal
pain.  The abdominal pain was described as worsening right upper
quadrant abdominal pain.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for a repeat ERCP procedure. Prior to the procedure, the
patient denied recent fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath, or change in bowel habits.  The patient does note
generalized weakness and a fair appetite.

ERCP was performed on [**2144-7-3**] which showed obstruction of
ampulla of Vater, proximal migration of the plastic stent that
had been placed on [**2144-6-9**].  Attempts were made to pull out the
plastic stent but unsuccessfully.  The plastic stent was left in
place and a new wall stent was placed to relieve the obstruction
of the ampulla of VATER.

Preprocedure, the patient developed atrial fibrillation, rapid to
the 200s, with a blood pressure of 130/80, 02 saturations of 100%
on 4 liters.  The patient was given Lopressor 2.5 mg IV times one
and the heart rate dropped to the 150s.  The patient was given
0.5 Versed, 25 mg of Fentanyl for the procedure.

On arrival to see the patient, telemetry showed rapid atrial
fibrillation in the 160s-180s.  Her blood pressure, respiratory
rate, and 02 saturations were stable.  The patient was given
Lopressor IV 5 mg times two and her heart rate went into the 100s
to 120s and then went back up.  The patient was transferred to
the ICU for further evaluation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION PER GI NOTE:  Vital signs:  Blood
pressure 134/64, respiratory rate 18, temperature 97.4.
HEENT:  The pupils were equally round and reactive to light
and accommodation, icteric.  Neck:  No cervical or
supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear.  Cardiac:
S1, S2, irregular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  Tenderness at
the right upper quadrant.  Extremities:  No edema.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 30.7,
hematocrit 38.8, platelets 277,000.  INR 1.2.  The
electrolyte panel revealed a sodium of 138, K 4.6, chloride
106, BUN 60, creatinine 1.7.  Glucose 243.  ALT 88, AST 81,
alkaline phosphatase 548, amylase 40, total bilirubin 4,
lipase 54.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 100, normal axis, normal
intervals, peaked T wave isolated in V2, Q wave in III, no ST
changes, suggestive of acute ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had ERCP
performed on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2144-7-3**].  The ERCP showed a proximally
migrated previously placed biliary stent.  The stent retrieval
was unsuccessful and there was a successful placement of a double
pigtail plastic stent.  The patient was kept on a ten day course
of  antibiotics: amp, levo, and Flagyl.  The patient's LFTs were
followed which were downtrending.  She took good po's and was
pain free at the time of discharge.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was in recurrent atrial
fibrillation, difficult to control with Lopressor.  The patient
was transitioned to a Diltiazem drip and then p.o. Diltiazem.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient's chest x-ray was clear.

4.  RENAL:  The patient was with a prerenal state.  Her
creatinine was slightly elevated on arrival.  The patient's
creatinine stabilized throughout her hospitalization.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient is with diabetes.  She was kept on
q.i.d. fingersticks and NPH.

6.  SPEECH AND SWALLOW:  During her hospital course, the patient
had an evaluation, GI aspirate, and the patient's repeat speech
and swallow evaluation showed ability to swallow thick nectar as
well as her pills.  Per the patient, the patient refused tube
feeding.

7.  CODE STATUS:  DNR/DNI confirmed with son and patient.
Possible need to have the initial stent removed was discussed
with the patient and her family.  The patient and family elected
not pursue with removal of the stent at this time and to pursue a
more conservative approach.

8.  ACCESS:  A PICC line was placed in-house.

9.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient demonstrated some mild confusion,
possibly due to narcotic use and/or narcotic withdrawal given
abdominal pain.  The patient required this intermittently
throughout her hospitalization.  Neurologic status improved
during the course of her hospitalization.

DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to hospice.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pancreatic cancer.
2.  Cholangitis.
3.  Diabetes.
