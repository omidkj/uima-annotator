History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59M with ESRD on HD, MSSA endocarditis, and hip
arthroplasty complicated by polymicrobial infection
(Enterobacter, K. oxytoca, VRE) with recent washout presenting
with altered mental status and hypotension.

The patient has a very long and complicated medical course over
the last six months. As summarized by recent admission note, in
[**2156-11-10**] he developed high grade MSSA bacteremia in the
context of a left septic wrist infection. Despite tratment with
6 weeks of cefazoline during HD he sustained significant
valvular damage and plans were made for him to undergo a
surgical intervention.  Unfortunately, while this was being
proceeded toward he sustained a fractured right hip
necessitating a hemiarthroplasty on [**2157-1-11**]. He developed
ischemic bowel in the post operative period and underwent
repeated exploratory laparotomies ultimately resulting in a
sub-total colectomy and ileostomy. His prosthetic hip became
dislocated and he underwent revision hemiarthroplasty in mid
[**2157-1-10**] complicatd by an infected hematoma of the hip with
cultures growing Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca
initially followed by VRE.  This required removal of hardware
and ultimately removal of his antibiotic impregnated spacer on
[**2157-2-22**].  His most recent TEE in [**Month (only) 956**] revealed persistence
of a posterior mitral valve leaflet vegetation/abscess which had
progressed in size in comparison with the echocardiogram
completed in [**2156-12-11**]. Associated with this lesion is
severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic valvular
regurgitation.

He was admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] on [**5-11**] for valve repair (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 101020**]) but was found to be too malnourished. His G/J
tube was repositioned as it was in his esopahgus.  He had been
on daptomycin/ciprofloxacin for suppression of his joint
infection, but these antibiotics were stopped during this
admission. He remained afebrile with sterile blood cultures and
was eventually discharged with plan for readmission for cardiac
surgery though this was once again postponed.  The patient was
again recently hospitalized from [**6-2**] to [**6-17**] after presented
with left hip wound incisional wound pain. Bone and synovial
tissue cultures isolated vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus The
patient was started on 4 weeks of ciprofloxacin and 6 weeks of
daptomycin with day 1 being [**2157-6-16**]. Orthopedics washed out his
wound twice and placed a VAC to assist with healing. 1 day prior
to discharge his wound was closed after washout with only a
hemovac drain in place. The Hemovac was removed without
difficulty [**6-23**] in follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. There was some
slight serous drainage from the wound, but overall things
appeared to be healing appropriately.

On the day of presentation, the patient was sent from [**Hospital1 **]
after he developed slurred speech and confusion after HD. Per
report, fluid was removed during the session and he was
transiently hypoxic to 90% on RA. The patient complained of
nausea, dizzines, bilateral eye pain and 5-6 days of HA. He
denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.  He
denied fevers/chills, [**Last Name (un) 2043**] pain, or LOC.

In the emergency department, initial vitals were 97.2 90 74/30
14 100%. He was given vancomycin 1g and gentamicin 60mg and 1.5
L of NS. With blood pressuress remaining in the 70s, he was
started on norepinephrine then admitted to the MICU for further
management.
