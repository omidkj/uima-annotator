Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of
intracerebral hemorrhage [**6-/2137**], metastatic liver cancer,
hypertension,and possible seizures who initially presented to an
outside hospital with altered mental status.

Patient reportedly was in his usual state of health
post-hemorrhage until evening of [**2137-8-17**]. At that time, his
girlfriend came home from work and found him to be disoriented
and confused.  She had last seen him well and at his baseline
earlier that morning. They ate dinner and after dinner he
complained of a headache. He took Tylenol and went to sit in
their living room. Shortly thereafter, he apparently tried to
get up from a chair and had a fall; this was unwitnessed so
unclear if any abnormal movements or seizure activity occurred.
Girlfriend reports that after the fall, his confusion worsened.
She noted that he seemed weak and tired. Upon walking, he was
running into things and holding onto the wall for support.
Therefore, she brought him to an outside hospital for
evaluation.

On arrival to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital, he was afebrile, BP 122/82,
HR 75 and RR 20. CT scan showed new left sided parieto-occipital
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. He was given Decadron 10 mg IV x1.

Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation on
[**2137-8-17**]. In the ED here, received mannitol, labetalol, dilantin,
and one unit of plasma.


Past Medical History:
1. Intracerebral hemorrhage 8/[**2136**]. Presented with confusion
after fall. Post-hemorrhage he has had episodes of confusion and
dysarthria. Still has residual right sided weakness but is able
to ambulate independently.
2. Possible seizure, after hemorrhage in 8/[**2136**]. On dilantin.
3. Hypertension
4. Liver cancer status post resection with recurrence 3-4 months
ago. Metastatic lesions in lungs.
5. Asthma
6. Right knee surgery
7. Status post cholecystectomy


Social History:
Lives with girlfriend [**Name (NI) **] in [**Name (NI) 16843**]. Retired; formerly
worked for the Department of Public Works. Smokes [**1-24**] cigarettes
daily. History of alcohol use but quit in [**2137-5-23**]. No drug
use.

--------------
MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2137-8-18**]:
1) Motion degraded images. Large left parietal hematoma as
visualized on the CT scan with surrounding edema.
2) MRA is not of diagnostic quality. Flow signal is observed in
basilar artery and carotid siphon.
--------------
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-18**]:
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema in the
left parietal lobe. It is impossible to determine whether this
has progressed without comparison to prior studies. Should these
studies become available, a comparison will gladly be made.
--------------
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-8-21**]:
No obvious consolidating pulmonary infiltrates are identified.
The right pleural effusion appears to have increased somewhat in
the interval. There is the suggestion of a possible 1.5-cm right
midlung nodule. Please correlate with outside films or reports
to see if this is a known finding. Otherwise, followup films to
see if this persists recommended after an appropriate clinical
interval.
--------------
MRI HEAD WITH CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2137-8-21**]:
No significant interval change in the size of a large
intraparenchymal hematoma in the left parietal and occipital
lobes. There is no evidence of abnormal vascularity surrounding
this hematoma. There is peripheral enhancement of this hematoma
which raises the suspicion of an underlying neoplastic process
--------------
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-22**]:
No significant interval change in a large intraparenchymal
hematoma in the left occipital lobe when compared to [**2137-8-20**].
--------------
CHEST (LAT DECUB ONLY)  [**2137-8-22**]:
Freely layering moderate right pleural effusion.
-------------
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2137-8-23**]:
Findings suggestive of aggressive local recurrence of
hepatocellular cancer with invasion through the diaphragm, into
the IVC and right atrium, as well as additional masses within
the left hepatic lobe, innumerable pulmonary metastases, and
large, probably metastatic mass to the right psoas muscle. The
tumor thrombus within the IVC and right atrium is nonocclusive.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 62 year old male with a history of
hepatocellular carcinoma and left parietal intracerebral
hemorrhage on [**2137-6-26**] who presented with mental status change and
right hemiparesis. Non contrast head CT demonstrated a left
parietal hemorrhage with moderate edema. He was admitted to the
neurological ICU on [**2137-8-18**] for blood pressure management and
frequent neurological checks. Keppra was started for seizure
prophylaxis and atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia.

In light of his history of diffusely metastatic hepatocellular
