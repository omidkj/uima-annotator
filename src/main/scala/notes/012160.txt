Pertinent Results:
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2116-2-19**] 4:57 PM
CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with [**2116-2-19**], 14:50 p.m.,
and multiple chest radiographs as far back as [**2114-5-1**],
also chest CTA, [**2115-10-11**]. The extreme right
costophrenic angle is excluded from this study. A right internal
jugular vein line is seen in the distal SVC. The remainder of
the visualized chest is unchanged since the examination of 2.5
hours prior. No pneumothorax is seen on this single supine view.
IMPRESSION: Successful right internal jugular vein central
venous line placement, without definite pneumothorax. If
pneumothorax is of clinical concern, repeat radiograph in
upright position or left lateral decubitus (right side up)
should be performed.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2116-2-19**] 2:46 PM

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2115-10-11**].

The heart size is normal. Mediastinum has normal position,
contour, and width. The lungs are unremarkable. There is no
pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of intrathoracic pathology.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2116-2-20**] 6:17 PM
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures,
or major vascular territorial infarct is apparent. There are
unchanged linear fracture lines in the right occipital skull.
Size of ventricles, sulci, and basal cisterns is somewhat more
prominent than would be expected for a patient of this age and
may be related to ethanol toxicity associated brain atrophy.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
The surrounding soft tissue structures appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Stable right occipital skull fracture. No evidence
of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

EKG [**2-19**]
Baseline artifact
Sinus tachycardia
Nonspecific ST-T wave changes although baseline artifact makes
assessment
difficult Since previous tracing of [**2115-10-11**], ST-T wave changes
suggested but baseline artifact makes comparison difficult

.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2116-2-22**] 10:35 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: interval change, pneumonia, effusion?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 year old woman with anemia and wt loss. Desating, crackles on
exam.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval change, pneumonia, effusion?
PORTABLE CHEST [**2116-2-22**] AT 7:40

INDICATION: Desaturation crackles.

COMPARISON: [**2116-2-19**].

FINDINGS: There are new bibasilar pleural effusions and
associated atelectatic changes. The possibility of a left lower
lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded. Upper lungs are clear, and
the pulmonary vascular markings are within normal limits. Heart
size is normal. Right CVL identified with tip in SVC and no PTX.
