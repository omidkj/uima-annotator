Service:  Orthopedics

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old female
consulted by Orthopedics on [**2124-11-5**].  This 70 year
old female pedestrian was struck by motor vehicle with
positive loss of consciousness at outside hospital Emergency
Department, evaluation and diagnosed with Colles fracture,
right fibular fracture, left trimalleolar fracture and small
left subarachnoid hemorrhage.  The wrist and ankle were
reduced, splinted.  The patient complained of pain in legs
now back and wrists.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, coronary
artery disease, and coronary artery bypass graft.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin causes edema.

MEDICATIONS:  Plavix, Lopressor, Zocor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed blood pressure of
83/48, pulse 96.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Scalp
abrasion, cervical collar in place, lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and
rhythm.  Abdomen, tenderness to palpation in the upper
extremities.  Right arm splint in place.  Radial pulse 1+
bilaterally.  Sensation intact from fingers.  Good capillary
refill distally bilaterally.  Neurovascularly intact.
Positive movement.  Sensation of radial, ulnar and median
nerves, lower extremities. Bilateral lower extremities,
posterior splints in place, neurovascularly intact.
Sensation distally, knee examination.  Back, nontender, no
step-offs noted.

LABORATORY DATA:  X-ray, right ankle trimalleolar fracture
poorly reduced.  Right knee, tibial plateau fracture.  Left
fibula orthopedic fracture.  Right wrist Colles' fracture,
intra-articular involvement, right comminuted proximal fibula
neck fracture.  Displaced [**Last Name (un) 15677**] fracture of right knee.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Plan at that time was likely open reduction
and internal fixation of the right ankle.  The patient was
made NPO and given 2 units of packed red blood cells.  Will
need right wrist operated on at some point of fibula
fracture.  Repair as tolerated with cam marker.  Will need
thoracolumbosacral films to rule out spine fracture,
computerized tomography scan.  To evaluate plain films of
right tibia/fibula will need better imaging.  The patient was
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**], further recommendations to
follow.  On [**2124-11-9**], the patient was brought to the
Operating Room with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for open reduction and
internal fixation of the right distal radius fracture.
Surgery went without incident.  Postoperative plan is to
elevate the right upper extremity, stocking with intravenous
pole, pain management, occupational therapy consult
requested, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, Vancomycin times
48 hours secondary to patient's Penicillin allergy.  On
postoperative check the patient was doing well, right arm
splinted to intravenous pole, neurovascularly intact to
radial, ulnar and median nerves with recommendations to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4845**].  On
[**2124-11-10**], Plastic discontinued the right upper
extremity Hemovac drain.  On [**2124-11-13**] the patient
was brought to the Operating Room with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4304**] [**Name (STitle) 284**]
for open reduction and internal fixation of a right
trimalleolar fracture.  Surgery went without incident.  On
postoperative check the patient was complaining of mild right
ankle pain, some mild itching and questionable Kefzol
reaction.  Denied shortness of breath, denied change in
voice, positive p.o. fluids, denied nausea and vomiting.  The
patient was afebrile with vital signs stable.  Right lower
extremity dressing was clean, dry and intact.  Soft.  Toes
were warm and well perfused.  Positive sensation in movement
and toes.  Kefzol was discontinued at that time secondary to
questionable reaction to Kefzol.  The patient was put on
Clindamycin times for 48 hours, given Benadryl for rash. We
will monitor intravenous fluids until the patient taking p.o.
Elevate right lower extremity, advance diet as tolerated.
Right lower extremity, nonweightbearing.  On postoperative
day #1, the patient was comfortable, afebrile, vital signs
stable.  Right ankle dressing was clean, dry and intact.
Right anterior cruciate ligament to be in [**Doctor Last Name **] brace.
Right ankle nonweightbearing.  Left ankle cam marker,
weightbearing as tolerated.  Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously
q.d. times four weeks for anticoagulation.  The patient was
screened for rehabilitation with follow up plans with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 284**] in trauma clinic in two weeks, phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5499**].
The patient was also scheduled for an magnetic resonance
imaging scan of the right knee to rule out ligamentous
injury.  The patient will be discharged to an extended care
facility, will be right upper extremity nonweightbearing,
left lower extremity weightbearing as tolerated with Cam
marker.  Right lower extremity nonweightbearing, splint in
place, and knee immobilizer in place. Lovenox 40 mg
subcutaneously q.d. for a four week course of
anticoagulation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Right distal radius fracture, right
trimalleolar fracture, right proximal fibular fracture, left
fibular [**Doctor Last Name 11586**] B fracture, right tibial plateau motion
fracture.

FOLLOW UP:  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks, phone
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1113**].  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] in Trauma Clinic
in two weeks, phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5499**].  The patient is status post
open reduction and internal fixation of the right distal
radius fracture on [**2124-11-9**] as well as status post
open reduction and internal fixation of the right
trimalleolar fracture on [**2124-11-13**].
