History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 72511**] is a 71 y F who was in her usual state of health until
a day prior to arrival when she was in her bathroom and leaned
her left arm against the counter. Although she felt the onset of
abrupt pain, did not present to [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department
until the following day. She was found to have a urinary tract
infection, hypercalcemia, a R acetabular Fx and L prox ulnar Fx.
Lasix 20 mg IV, 1 L NS, 500 mg levaquin, and morphine was
administered. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for increased
level of care. At our ED, a hip CT was obtained and ortho was
consulted. A spint was applied to the left elbow and the patient
was admitted to medicine for preoperative evaluation.

Of  note, the patient has had 2 recent falls. On New year's Eve,
she fell when her walker got stuck on the dining room table. She
fell again 5 days prior to arrival when her walker got stuck in
a doorway. She landed on her right side and was helped up by
paramedics. She denies presyncope, LOC, head trauma,
palpitations, alcohol use. These appear to be mechanical falls.
.
ROS: denies pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea,
hematuria, hematochezia, chest pain, dyspnea, pedal edema,
palpitations, presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
CT PELVIS ORTHO W/O C  [**2120-3-31**] 10:10 PM
Concentric joint space narrowing, medial migration of the right
femoral head, subchondral cyst formation, and osteophyte
formations are noted. In addition to this, there are fractures
of the superior and inferior pubic rami, extending into the
medial wall of the acetabulum.

Concentric joint space narrowing with subchondral cyst formation
posteriorly is noted at the left hip, which overall appears
relatively spared compared to the degenerative changes at the
right hip.

Disc degenerative changes including vacuum phenomenon are seen
within the imaged portion of the lower lumbar spine. The
sacroiliac joints appear intact.

There is a large right hip joint effusion. A Foley catheter is
seen within the bladder. Small fat-containing a midline
abdominal wall hernia is incidentally noted. The imaged portions
of the low pelvic soft tissue structures are otherwise within
normal limits.

IMPRESSION:
1. Fracture through the right superior and inferior pubic rami,
extending into the medial wall of the acetabulum.
2. Severe right hip joint degenerative changes. Mild left hip
joint degenerative changes.
.
HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS RIGHT  [**2120-3-31**] 9:43 PM
FOUR VIEWS, RIGHT HIP: There is fracture through the anterior
and posterior columns and medial wall of the right acetabulum.
The right femoral head and neck are preserved without evidence
of femoral fracture. Also noted is irregularity of the right
inferior pubic ramus likely consistent with fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. Fracture of the right acetabulum, likely T-shaped.
2. Right inferior pubic ramus fracture.

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2120-3-31**] 9:42 PM
There is mild cardiomegaly. The pulmonary vasculature is within
normal limits. The lungs are clear, although the left
costophrenic angle is incompletely evaluated. There is no
pneumothorax. There is compression of the T12 vertebral body,
age indeterminate.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. The left costophrenic
angle is incompletely evaluated.
2. Compression of T12 vertebral body, age indeterminate.
WRIST(3 + VIEWS) LEFT  [**2120-3-31**] 9:42 PM
THREE VIEWS, LEFT WRIST: There is severe degenerative disease at
the first CMC joint. There is calcification of the triradiate
cartilage. There is diffuse osteopenia limiting evaluation for
non-displaced fractures.

THREE VIEWS, LEFT ELBOW: There is a transverse fracture through
the proximal portion of the left ulna in near anatomic
alignment. No effusion is appreciated.

IMPRESSION:
1. Minimally displaced fracture through the proximal left ulna.
2. Degenerative changes at the first CMC joint.
3. CPPD arthropathy.

EKG

Sinus tachycardia. Deep narrow Q waves in lead III, small Q
waves in
leads II and aVF. Low amplitude T waves in leads V4-V6.
Transmural inferior
wall myocardial infarction of undetermined age. Clinical
correlation is
required. No previous tracing available for comparison.

.
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

.
PARATHYROID SCAN  [**2120-4-2**]
Following the intravenous injection of tracer, images of the
neck including
anterior, pinhole and marker views were obtained at 20 minutes
and 2 hours.

Initial images show diffuse uptake within the thyroid gland.

Delayed images show a persistant focus of uptake within the left
mid thyroid
bed, suggestive of a parathyroid adenoma. Other thyroid gland
uptake has washed
out on delayed images.

IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of a parathyroid adenoma in the
left mid thyroid
bed.

Persantine MIBI
IMPRESSION: No obvious areas of ischemia with limited views and
resolution.
Stress Test:
IMPRESSION: Non-specific ECG changes in the absence of anginal
symptoms.

PARATHYROID U.S.  [**2120-4-3**] 11:19 AM
THYROID ULTRASOUND: Compared to report of the parathyroid
scintiscan from [**2120-4-2**]. There are multiple tiny colloid cysts
throughout the right lobe of the thyroid. A single small 7 x 5 x
4 mm nodule is seen in the mid pole of the right thyroid with
spongiform appearance and a well-circumscribed thin hypoechoic
rim. On the left, the thyroid is diffusely enlarged and
heterogeneous with at least two predominantly cystic nodules,
the largest of which in the lower pole measures 1.9 x 1.4 x 1.3
cm. The smaller in the mid pole measures 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm. No
parathyroid adenoma is appreciated.
