History of Present Illness:

has been followed with serial echocardiograms, which are slowly
showing increased gradients and worsening aortic stenosis.  He
now admits to some chest tightness and dyspnea on exertion along
with other mild CHF symptoms such as edema.  The diagnostic
studies were performed, his last cardiac echocardiogram on [**8-19**], [**2104**] showed an EF of 60-65%, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.7 cm2, a peak
gradient of 71, a mean of 50, mild AI, mild MR, mild TR, and a
slightly dilated ascending aorta of 4.1 cm.  His cardiac
catheterization which was performed on [**2104-8-14**] showed mid
LAD 30% stenosis, otherwise normal coronaries.  He underwent a
carotid ultrasound in [**2104-2-12**], which showed no significant
stenosis in either internal carotid arteries.


Past Medical History:
Aortic stenosis, CHF, Cerebrovascular disease/TIA.  He has
undergone left carotid endarterectomy in [**2094**]. Hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gout,
osteoarthritis, glaucoma, questioned history of macular
degeneration, restless leg syndrome, and he had a squamous cell
lesion behind his right ear removed.  He is also status post
tonsillectomy.

after approximately one pack a [**Known lastname **] times 20 years.  He is a

Physical Exam:
On physical examination, his pulse is 78.  Respirations are 12.
Blood pressure is 160/80.  He is approximately 6 feet tall and
weighs 189 lbs.  In general, he appears to be well-developed and
well-nourished male in no acute distress.  His skin is warm,
dry, and intact.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light.  His oropharynx is benign.
His neck is supple with full range of motion without any JVD.
His lungs are clear to auscultation.  His cardiac examination
reveals a regular rate and rhythm with an IV/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, and
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  His extremities are
warm and well perfused with no edema at this time.
Neurologically, he is moving all extremities, alert and oriented
x3, and nonfocal examination.  Of note, his cardiac murmur is
transmitted to both carotid arteries.


Pertinent Results:
[**2104-10-6**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate
([**2-13**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mr.[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] at 10:15.

POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
Aortic prosthesis in place functioning well and stable in
position. The mean gradient across the aortic valve is 10mm of
Hg.
Intact thoracic aortic contour.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent aortic valve replacement by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please see seperate dictated
operative note. Following the operation, he was brought to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He was
transfused with PRBCs for a hematocrit of 23%. He was started on
beta blockade and ACEI was resumed. He maintained good
hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative [**Known lastname **]
one. He was noted to have a 26 beat run of NSVT on postoperative
[**Known lastname **] two. K and Mg were monitored and repleted per protocol. Beta
blockade was advanced as tolerated. Over several [**Known lastname **], no
further bouts of NSVT were noted but he was placed on oral
magnesium for three [**Known lastname **].  He was ready for discharge on post-op
[**Known lastname **] 4.
