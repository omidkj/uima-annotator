Pertinent Results:
CXR:
FINDINGS: A single AP supine image. Comparison study taken 3
hours earlier. The ETT has been withdrawn slightly and its tip
is now 3 cm above the carina in good position. The NG line is
well positioned in the lower portion of the stomach. The heart
shows fairly marked enlargement, predominantly left ventricular.
There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery but the prosthetic
valves are not clearly defined. There is also evidence of CABG
procedure with some cardiovascular clips and sternal sutures
noted. The aorta is slightly calcified and unfolded. The
pulmonary vessels show fairly marked upper zone redistribution.
There is a moderate sized right sided pleural effusion. These
findings are consistent with left heart failure. The severity of
the cardiac decompensation is not significantly changed since
the prior study. An external electrode overlies the inferior
aspect of the cardiac silhouette. A pacemaker overlies the left
shoulder region with a single electrode extending into the apex
of the right ventricle.

IMPRESSION: 1) Evidence of prior surgery. There is now left
ventricular decompensation of moderate severity associated with
a right sided effusion. The ETT is now in good position.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory failure: When the aptient was admitted, he was
placed on BiPap, however continued to have decreased PaO2 and
was acidotic and hypercarbic. Therefore he was intubated and
remained intubated until [**11-18**] when he was successfully
extubated/  The patient's respitary failure was though to be due
to a combination of CHF, a large pleural effusion and possibly a
PNA. He was aggressively diuresed, and his plueral effusion was
tapped and found to be transudative, and he was placed on broad
spectrum antibiotics. The IV antiobiotics were switched to PO
levofloxacin.  Repeat CXR showed increased right pleural
effusion compared to the CXR after the thoracentesis.  However,
pt continued to breath comfortably on room air.  Pt also got Flu
vaccine during his stay.

2. Decompensated CHF: The patient came in with a weight of
69.4kg and his dry weight is 60kg. The patient later admitted to
drinking a large amount of water in rehab and being constantly
thirsty. Historically the patient responds best to natrecor with
dopamine. He was started on dopamine and natrecor for diuresis
and Lasix IV bolsues were added as needed. As his urine output
fell, he was started on a Lasix drip. Once he was close to his
dry weight, Natrecor was stopped and he was switched to PO
Zaroxyln and Lasix prn. He was eventually switched converted to
standing po Bumex 2 mg po bid and achieved his ideal wt of 60 kg
and remained stable.  Once pt was off dopamine tolerating BP,
Toprol XL was started.  Lisinopril was re-started as well.
These medications were administered at bedtime since his SBP
drops to 80's with these meds.  Standing po Bumex was started (2
mg [**Hospital1 **]).  Pt achieved his ideal dry weight of 60.5 kg at one
point, but wt returned to 63.5 kg which was thought to be
secondary to sodium retention from the prednisone he took for
gout flare.  His discharge weight was 62.8 kg.  He was
discharged with Toprol 12.5 mg po qhs, Lisinopril 1.25 mg po
qhs, Bumex 2 mg po bid.  Pt is very sensitive to ACEI and drops
his BP in 80's, so it is given at bedtime.  It is emphasized
that his baseline BP is in the 80's-low 100's, and no
medications should be held for SBP of high 80's or 90's.  Toprol
and Lisinopril should be spaced 2 hr apart.  Pt will be followed
at [**Hospital 1902**] clinic.

3. CAD: The paitent is s/p RCA stenting on [**2128-7-30**] for reversible
inferior wall defect. His ASA and plavix were continued and
carvediol and lisinopril were initially held for low SBP.  As
above, after diuresis and improved cardiac output, pt was
started on Toprol and lisinopril.

4. Rhythm: Chronic afib s/p VVI pacer [**2128-8-12**]. Pt was initially
started on digoxin for rate control while he was hypotensive and
on dopamine gtt.  But it was switched to Toprol later for rate
control.  Coumadin was held for thoracentesis but re-started.

5. Chronic anemia [**1-26**] mechanical hemolysis MDS, and anemia of
chronic disease.  He was initially continued on iron and folate,
but the EPO was given 10,000 units qMWF which is half of what he
was getting on last admission to keep his Hct stable.  His Hct
slowly drifted down, so the EPO was increased to 20,000 units
qMWF with good response.  His Hct remained stable at 29-30.  Pt
will be discharged with EPO 20,000 qMWF and Iron supplement.

8.CRI: The paitent's baseline is 1.2. He had a bump up to 3.0 on
admission.  His creatinine improved to his near baseline after
aggressive diuresis to improved the cardiac output.

9.Mechanical valve: Pt was on Coumadin which was held initiallya
and bridged with Heparin gtt for procedures.  Coumadin was
re-started with goal of INR 2.5-3.5.  INR was 3.5 on discharge.


10. Gout: Pt developed a severe left foot pain localized at
tarsal area.  The area appeared erythematous and tender to
pa
