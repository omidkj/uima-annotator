HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68-year-old
gentlemen who was transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital
with cholangitis for possible endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until two
to three days prior to admission at the [**Hospital3 417**].  He
developed fever and abdominal pain.  Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea.  Also noted productive cough, but denied chest pain
or shortness of breath.  He presented to the Emergency Room,
was noted to have abdominal pain, fever and jaundice.
Work-up at the outside hospital included a right upper
quadrant ultrasound which showed no cholelithiasis and a
common bile duct of 7.5 mm.  He was noted to have a
transaminitis with AST 190, ALT 273, alkaline phosphatase of
357.  He had a total bilirubin of 4.1.  He was also noted to
have a white blood cell count of 17.3.

At the outside hospital, he was also noted to be dyspneic and
was ruled out for myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes
which were negative.  He was also ruled out for pulmonary
embolism with a CT scan.  He was found to have an infiltrate
on the right on chest x-ray and was treated for presumed
congestive heart failure with Lasix.  He was also treated
with ampicillin, Flagyl and gentamicin for presumed biliary
sepsis after a blood culture came back positive for
Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] on [**11-25**] for possible endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2132**].
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Newly diagnosed with diabetes at the outside hospital.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Captopril 50 mg po t.i.d.
2.  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg po q.d.
3.  Labetalol 200 mg po b.i.d.
4.  Clonidine .3 mg po b.i.d.
5.  Zocor.

ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Denied family history of heart disease,
hypertension or diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1474**].  Retired
electrical technician.  Has no smoking history.  Denies
alcohol use.  No recent travel.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs:
Temperature 98.9.  Heart rate 85.  Blood pressure 148/84.
Respiratory rate 28.  Oxygen saturation 94% on four liter
nasal cannula.  He was generally mildly tachypneic, but alert
and oriented times three and in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular eye movements intact.
Sclerae mildly icteric.  Neck was supple, jugular venous
pressure 6-7 cm and carotids 2+.  Chest:  Crackles noted
bilaterally, half way up the chest and crackles anteriorly
over the right.  No wheeze, no retractions.  Cardiac:  Normal
S1, S2 with  a mild systolic ejection murmur [**3-9**] at the left
upper sternal border.  No S3 or S4.  Abdomen was distended
but soft, diffusely tender with a positive [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.  No
rebound, no guarding.  Extremities:  Warm, pulses 2+ and no
edema.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 16.3, hematocrit 40.6,
platelet count 115,000.  Chem-7:  Sodium 136, potassium 4.1,
chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, BUN 27, creatinine .8,
platelets 282,000, ALT 202, AST 88, alkaline phosphatase 459,
total bilirubin 13.6.  Electrocardiogram showed a normal
sinus rhythm at 88 beats per minute, normal axis, normal
intervals, left ventricular hypertrophy, old Q waves in II,
III and aVF.  Electrocardiogram looked unchanged from prior.
Chest x-ray with cardiomegaly and diffuse infiltrates, right
upper lobe greater than the left.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By systems:

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was noted on presentation to be
dyspneic.  On the second hospital day, he developed
progressive respiratory failure and was intubated.  Further
chest x-ray's during his hospital course demonstrated
progressive bilateral infiltrates that were thought to
represent pneumonia progressing to adult respiratory distress
syndrome.  A chest CT on the [**12-1**] showed
multilobar consolidation versus collapse.  He underwent
bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage which were
nondiagnostic.  On [**12-1**], he underwent a thoracentesis
for a right pleural effusion, which was transudative.  He
remained on the ventilator until [**12-6**] when he was
extubated uneventfully.  His prolonged course on the
ventilator was secondary to underlying progression of
pneumonia adult respiratory distress syndrome and then
subsequent congestive heart failure which improved with
diuresis.  After extubation, he was ventilating well on room
air, not requiring any oxygen and his pulmonary status had
improved remarkably.

2.  Cardiac:  Patient received an echocardiogram on [**11-29**] which showed left ventricular systolic function to be
severely depressed with an ejection fraction of 25-30% and
left ventricular wall motion akinesis.  He was treated with
aspirin and diuresed with Lasix for his congestive heart
failure.  He was also noted to have labile hypertension which
was thought to be secondary to anxiety on ventilation.  He
was treated with Captopril and metoprolol, which improved his
hypertension, and subsequent to extubation, his blood
pressure decreased markedly, but he remained on
antihypertensives.

3.  Gastrointestinal: Patient initially presented with fever,
right upper quadrant pain, jaundice and transaminitis
consistent with cholangitis.  He was seen by the Biliary Team
here who deferred endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography secondary to his pulmonary status
and his improving LFTs.  His LFTs continued to improve and he
was covered on broad spectrum antibiotics, ampicillin,
levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The Biliary Team suggested an
elective endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography some
time in the future.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound here on
the [**11-28**] showed a heterogenous liver, a common
bile duct measuring 7.5 mm, no cholelithiasis and a left
portal vein thrombosis.  Gastrointestinal was consulted for
the left portal vein thrombosis, they recommended no
anticoagulation and continued broad spectrum antibiotics.  He
was treated with TPN, transitioned to tube feeds and then
after extubation tolerated a house diet.  His LFTs resolved
to normal levels and on extubation he denied abdominal pain,
was having bowel movements and no further gastrointestinal
complication.

4.  Infectious Disease:  Patient was initially treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics for a blood culture positive for
klebsiella pneumoniae at the outside hospital.  The broad
spectrum antibiotics were discontinued on [**12-1**] and he
was continued on the levofloxacin.  Cefepime was added for
double coverage of Klebsiella.  He had no growth on multiple
cultures here including blood, sputum, urine, fungal
cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage and thoracentesis.  A chest
and abdomen CT were done on [**12-1**] for persistent fevers.
Chest CT demonstrated multifocal consolidation and the
abdominal CT showed no free air, no abscess, no source of
infection.  He was continued on the levofloxacin and the
cefepime and was subsequently afebrile for the remainder of
his course.  His microbiology was no growth in any cultures
at this hospital.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient was newly diagnosed with diabetes
mellitus at the outside hospital.  During this hospital stay,
he was on an insulin drip and transitioned to insulin sliding
scale.  He will be discharged on an oral hypoglycemic.

6.  Lines:  Patient had a left subclavian and a left arterial
line placed on the [**11-26**].  The left subclavian was
switched to a right internal jugular on [**12-5**].  The
lines functioned properly.

7.  Prophylaxis:  He was on heparin subcutaneously and
Protonix during his hospital stay.  He was full code and
communications were with his wife and family who visited
regularly.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient will be discharged in stable
condition.
