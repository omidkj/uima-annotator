Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: BRBPR
REASON FOR MICU ADMISSION: Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
53yoF with severe asthma and COPD (2-4L home O2, FEV1/FVC 45%
1/09, patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] chronically on steroids, who
presents with abdominal pain and is admitted to the MICU for
hypotension.
.
Pt reports that on Monday, 3 days prior to admission, she
developed sudden-onset, sharp "gassy pain," LLQ > RLQ, which
persisted for the next 1.5 days until admission. She reports
sitting on the toilet for >45 minutes after the initial onset of
pain without being able to have a bowel movement. She then had a
bowel movement which was brown in color and the consistency of
mud. Subsequently, she had ~12 bowel movements with dark red
blood in the toilet. She continued to have bowel movements which
became less dark red and more watery red. This was accompanied
by severe, sharp, achy pain. Per MICU note, pain was transiently
relieved by bowel movements. Her pain persisted until
presentation, with multiple episodes lasting a few minutes and
briefly relieved by bowel movements. Her symptoms were
reportedly aggravated by position but unrelated to food. She has
chronic nausea at baseline that is unchanged and denied fevers,
chills, cp, or SOB. She does report having lightheadedness. Of
note, she has no history of PVD, CAD, or arrhythmia. She has
never had bloody bowel movements in the past, and has never had
a colonoscopy before.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: 97.1 110 107/68 20 98.
She did not have a BM in the ED but a rectal demonstrated a
small amount of pink blood. SBPs fell to 70s and responded to 2L
NS. Transfusion was initiated but stopped before patient
received any blood when hct returned at 48. An abdominal CT was
performed that demonstrated ischemic vs infectious colitis and
surgery was consulted. They believed ischemic colitis was less
likely, and pt was started on Cipro/Flagyl for likely infectious
colitis and was admitted to the MICU for management of
hypotension.
.
In the MICU, hypotension resolved with IVF and 2 units PRBC, and
the patient was transferred to the floor after vitals and hct
were stable.
.
Currently, pt reports continued abdominal pain which is
moderately worse than previous to her po intake of clear
liquids, but reports this is significantly improved from
admission. Severity is currently [**5-30**], and pain is worse at the
L quadrant than the R.

STUDIES:
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**1-9**]:
Findings consistent with colitis of the left colon, with wall
thickening and pericolonic stranding involving the distal
transverse colon extending distally to involve all of the
descending colon and possibly the very proximal sigmoid colon,
consistent with colitis (ischemic versus infectious versus
inflammatory). No pneumatosis or portal venous gas.
Mildly dilated loops of small bowel without clear transition
point, may
represent a reactive ileus although partial/very early mild
small-bowel
obstruction is not excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
53F with COPD (2-4L home O2, FEV1/FVC 45% 1/09, patient of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 575**] presenting with 3 days of bloody diarrhea and
hypotension responsive to fluids. CT abdomen showed colonic wall
thickening and fat stranding. Findings believed to be most
consistent with infectious colitis.
.
#. Colitis: Patient with no history of GI bleed presenting with
3 days of deep red blood per rectum and abdominal pain. Patient
was hypotensive and initially admitted to the MICU.  Hct trended
from 48.9 -> 41.1 -> 36.2 during hospital stay with IVF and 2
units PRBC were given in the MICU. Patient was likely initially
hemoconcentrated from bloody bowel movements, as WBC was also
20.5 -> 14.7 -> 17.4 with IVF. Surgery was consulted, and felt
this was unlikely to be ischemic colitis given symptoms did not
become worse with food. GI was consulted, and felt colonoscopy
should be deferred until resolution of acute event. Most likely
etiology was determined to be infectious colitis, and symptoms
improved on Cipro/Flagyl. C. diff is possible given recent
levofloxacin use, and stool cultures were ordered for C. diff,
Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, E-coli O157:H7,
and HSV/CMV (given chronic prednisone use).  Stool cultures were
pending on discharge, and patient will follow-up as an
outpatient.  Patient's leukocytosis resolved on Cipro/Flagyl and
she was discharged on 10 days of Cipro/Flagyl.  Patient was also
started on Atovaquone for prophylaxis given her chronic steroid
use.  She was also discharged on a brief course of Morphine
until the resolution of her acute abdominal pain.  She was
instructed not to take her home Percocet while taking the
Morphine.
.
# Hypotension: Likely hypovolemic with creatinine up to 1.0 from
baseline of 0.6 in setting of abdominal pain and decreased po
intake. Does meet SIRS criteria but sepsis unlikely in this
well-appearing woman. Patient's hypotension responded to NS IVF
and BP recovered to 100's-140's systolic.  Home Lisinopril and
Nifedipine were held in setting of recent hypotension and GI
bleed, and patient was instructed to continue holding Lisinopril
on discharge until follow-up.
.
# Asthma/COPD: 2-4L home O2, FEV1/FVC 45% on [**12-29**] and patient of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**]. On prednisone chronically (since ~[**2192-7-21**] per
patient, > 30 g/day) with notes suggesting attempt to taper.
Continued home bronchodilators (advair, albuterol), prednisone
30 mg daily.
.
# HTN: Stable. Held home BP meds as above.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin.
