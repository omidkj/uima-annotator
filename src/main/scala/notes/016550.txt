History of Present Illness:
79 y/o female with a h/o CAD s/p CABG '[**30**], multiple myeloma not
treated per pts wishes, T2DM, and CHF who presented w/ sepsis of
unclear etiology. She was recently admitted in [**2136-3-28**] for
congestive heart failure. She has a h/o urinary retention for
which she has an indwelling foley. Per VNA she had been having
foul smelling urine for two days prior to her admission. On the
morning of her admission she had shaking chills, unable to take
temperature due to shaking and was brought by family to ED. At
that time noted to have temp of 105 rectal, initial BP 158/80,
and noted to be volume overloaded.
.
Recently the pt came to the ED two days ago, after choking on
"grits" at breakfast. She was administered "heimlich" by
daughter, and resolved. CXR at that time notable for ? CABG
aneurysm, but no PNA.
.
She was given lasix 40 mg IV w/ subsequent BP drop to 80s SBP.
She was given azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin for
probable pneumonia. She denied any fevers/chills/n/v/diarrhea.
She denies any SOB, CP, or abdominal pain.

Pertinent Results:
[**2136-4-20**] CXR
Limited examination. There is suggestion of worsening fluid
balance. If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views
for more optimal evaluation.
.
[**2136-4-21**] CT Torso
Lobulated mass in the cecum and ascending colon of indeterminate
etiology without bowel obstruction. Possibilities include a
carcinoma, plasmacytoma or lymphoma, but given the clinical
presentation of sepsis, infectious process is in the
differential. Endoscopy is recommended.
Diverticulosis.
Enlarging bilateral adrenal masses.
New bilateral pleural effusions
Anasarca.
.
EKG: Sinus tachy 100, [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] dep and TWI in V4-V6, II, III.
.
Imaging: CXR: Diffuse haziness, vascularity, cardiomegaly.
Echo: EF 30-35%, 2+MR, 3+TR, 1+AR. Mod global RVHK, global LVHK.

.
[**4-24**] CT head: 1. No evidence of acute major vascular territorial
infarct, hemorrhage, or enhancing lesions. If high clinical
suspicion, MRI would be more sensitive evaluation. 2.
Myelomatous involvement of the skull, with no epidural or other
associated soft tissue mass.
.
[**4-24**] CXR: Compared with [**2136-4-21**], the pulmonary edema has
resolved. There is persistent retrocardiac atelectasis/opacity.
The remainder of the visualized lung fields appear clear.
.
[**4-27**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1. Cardiomegaly with reflux of contrast
into enlarged hepatic veins suggestive of right heart
dysfunction. 2. Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent
relaxation atelectasis, right greater than left, unchanged. 3.
Stable bilateral adrenal masses previously characterized as
adenomas. 4. Anasarca. 5. Filling defects within the right colon
seen on prior examination no longer visualized and likely
represented stool that has passed in the interim. 6. Colonic
diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU COURSE:
.
79 y/o female with a h/o CAD s/p CABG, T2DM, MM, and CHF who
presented with sepsis. She was found to have a lobulated mass in
the cecum and ascending colon on CT torso and [**2-12**] blood cx
bottles growing G+ cocci. The following issues were addressed
during this admission.
.
She was admitted to the MICU on a short course of Levophed. In
the MICU, her blood cultures have grown 2/4 bottles of G+ Cocci,
ucx negative. Her abdominal CT showed lobulated mass in the
cecum and ascending colon concerning for carcinoma. She has been
seen by the GI team who suggested the possibility of
plasmacytoma and lymphoma in the differential. She is to be
scoped by GI on a future date once they deem her stable. Of note
she was transfused with 1 unit of PRBCs for Hct of 24 with
minimal response but no evidence of acute blood loss/hemolysis.
.
GENERAL MEDICINE FLOOR:
.
# Sepsis/bacteremia. [**4-11**] blood cultures grew Gemella, unable to
perform sensitivies. ID consulted for antibiotic coverage; they
recommended vancomycin. All surveillance cultures were negative
to date. The patient declined TEE to rule out endocarditis, so
she will be treated with a six week course of vancomycin to
empirically treat endocarditis. All other cultures were
negative.
.
# Lobulated mass in the cecum and ascending colon. First CT
showed a lobulated mass that was concerning for plasmacytoma vs.
lymphoma vs. primary colon CA. However, on repeat CT, there was
no mass, and the initial mass was likely intracolonic fecal
matter.
.
# CHF. Fluid overloaded on exam (increased JVP, lower extremity
edema, bibasilar crackles on lung exam). Blood pressures have
been within normal limits; will slowly add back cardiac
medications (atenolol, furosemide) and *gentle* diuresis as
blood pressure tolerates. TTE on [**3-24**] demonstrated decreased
ejection fraction of 30-35% and biventricular hypokinesis.
- Oral furosemide according to home regimen
- Start [**Last Name (un) **]
.
# Coagulopathy. Chronic. INR, PTT elevated. Possible clotting
factor inhibitor given malignancy vs. factor deficiency.  At the
time of discharge, a mixing study was pending; this should be
followed up as an outpatient.
.
# Diplopia. During the hospitalization, the patient complained
of double vision; her cranial nerve exam was otherwise
unremarkable. CT head showed no evidence of mass, infection, or
infarct to explain the findings. She was seen by ophthalmology
consult, who noted microvascular changes consistent with the
patient's known diabetes and recommended outpatient follow-up.
.
# Hyponatremia. Chronic problem, possibly secondary to multiple
myeloma +/- CHF. No interventions during this hospitalization.
.
# Anemia. Most likely multifactorial in etiology (with hist
