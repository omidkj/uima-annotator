Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
2 week history of worsening left buttock claudication.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2139-1-1**]: angiojet lysis; angioplasty left common femoral
artery/superficial femoral artery lysis
[**2139-1-1**]: exploratory lap , left femoral artery thrombectomy, L
external iliac artery to superficial femoral artery interposit
for thrombosis, left lower extremity fasciotomies
[**2139-1-2**]: Right external iliac artery to superficial femoral
artery interposit for thrombosis, right lower extremity
fasciotomies
[**2139-1-2**]: Cutdown on left brachial artery and thrombectomy


History of Present Illness:
Patient states she was in her usual state of health until 2
prior to admission when she began experiencing buttock pain
after approximately 150-200 feet of walking. The pain is
alleviated by rest and worsens with activity.
There is no pain at rest. She had no palpable or dopplerable DP
on the left. Duplex was performed that demonstrates the right
femoral endarterectomy and iliac stent are widely patent.  On
the left, however, the distal external iliac and common femoral
are occluded.  There is also a short-segment occlusion in the
mid SFA.  ABIs are 0.72 on the right and 0.32 on the left.  She
presents electively for potential endovascular thrombectomy with
or without lysis therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old with a history of known symptomatic distal external
iliac and common femoral and superficial femoral artery
occlusion presents electively on [**2139-1-1**] for  endovascular
thrombectomy with lysis therapy. The procedure was uncomplicated
but shortly after presentation to the VICU, she complained of
severe abdominal pain.  A noncontrast CT scan identified a large
retroperitoneal hematoma. In addition, pulses were noted to be
absent on the left. She was brought back to the OR for an ex-lap
and left external iliac artery to superior femoral artery bypass
with profunda ligation and left lower extremity fasciotomies.
She was transferred to the ICU for postoperative care where she
was found on [**2139-1-2**] to have circulatory compromise to the right
leg and was brought back to the OR for a right external iliac
artery to superficial femoral artery interposit and right lower
extremity fasciotomies.  Later that day, she was found to have a
dusky pulseless left hand which required a left brachial artery
thrombectomy.
Postoperative course was significant for acute kidney injury and
respiratory failure secondary to massive fluid overload
requiring mechanical ventiliation until [**2139-1-9**].  She was
transferred out of the ICU on POD 8 where she has remained
hemodynamically stable.  Her diet was gradually advanced.  She
is ambulatory with a walker. She worked with physical therapy
who recommended rehab.  She was discharged to rehab on POD #14
in stable condition.  Follow-up has been arranged with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.

1. Peripheral Arterial Disease
sp multiple vascular procedures this admission as above. We will
continue plavix and coumadin with INR goal [**12-19**].  Fasciotomy
sites have been closed.  Staples will remain in until followup
visit.   Of note, her HIT screen was negative.

2. Acute Kidney Injury
The patient has multiple potential causes for [**Last Name (un) **]. She received
contrast on [**1-1**], she was hypotensive and underwent multiple
surgies on [**1-2**], and she had muscle break down with a CK peak in
of [**Numeric Identifier 94870**] postoperatively. Urine microscopy shows muddy brown
casts consistent with ATN. Baseline cr was 0.6. Peak BUN/cr was
70/3.7 on [**2139-1-9**].  She has had a steady recovery in her renal
function with BUN/cr today 66/1.9.  We have not restarted her
home medications of #LISINOPRIL, SPIROLACTONE AND LASIX#
secondary to this [**Last Name (un) **].

3.Decreased Movement Left Arm
Decreased strength and movement was noted in her left arm after
surgery. Given that she was fully anticoagulated, there was
concerns for a head bleed. On [**2139-1-8**] a noncontrast head CT
showed a single hyperdense left middle cerebral artery branch
which may represent a focal occlusion.  We have arranged
followup with a neurologist.  The left arm weakness has since
resolved.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after an angioplasty and lysis
to blockage in your leg arteries.  We were unable to open the
blockages with with a catheter so we needed to remove the clot
with surgery and do a bypass on the leg arteries.
