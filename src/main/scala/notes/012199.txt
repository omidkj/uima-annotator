Chief Complaint:
afib RVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion [**3-19**]


History of Present Illness:
53 with recurrent non-hodgkin's lympoma currently started new
round of chemo presents with afib RVR. Pt reports that for the
past week he has felt weak and unwell, and two days ago he felt
pre-syncopal. He denies any chest pain or shortness of [**Month/Year (2) 1440**].
He presented today to clinic today for routine pre-chemotherapy
echocardiogram and was found to be in afib RVR with HR 150. He
was sent to the ED from clinic. Incidentally, per [**Name (NI) **], pt had a
fever several days ago, was pan-cultured in [**Hospital3 4298**]
and empirically started on Levofloxacin.
.
In the ED, he was placed on a diltiazem drip. Per report he was
breifly hypotensive to SBP 70 but his pressures then improved.


Past Medical History:
Onc History: Patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12375**].
Found to have mesenteric mass [**10-1**] during workup after a fall
from a tree.  Biopsy [**12-2**] revealed mixed lymphocytes, CD19/20 +,
CD5 -, CD10 weakly positive, BCL-2/BCL-6 positive.  PET scan
demonstrated uptake in the abdomen and rectal area.  Underwent
R-CHOP * 6 ([**Date range (1) 22097**]) with complete remission.  PET scan in
[**5-3**] demonstrated recurrent disease (L retrocrural area 2.5 cm c
SCV 8.8 c/w lymphomatous recurrence).
.
Treated with R-ICE [**2103-5-23**] and then had a second cycle of R-ICE
[**2022-6-17**], autologous BMT [**2103-7-31**]. PET scan [**2103-9-11**] showed
resolution of lesion in L retrocrual area, but repeat PET
[**2103-12-10**] suggested recurrence.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
-Low Testosterone - Presented with muscle weakness, improved
with testosterone injections. Injections discontinued secondary
to elevated LFTs and lymphoma
-GERD
-Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation - was on digoxin. Then on
metoprolol. One episode in the setting of caffeine intake +
adderrall use.  Now not on any meds
-Rectal Hemorrhoids
-Sleep apnea on CPAP - does not use CPAP machine at home
-Elevated LFTs, elevated CPK - Had been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]. He
was concerned that chronically elevated CPK may represent muscle
etiology [**12-29**] IM injections of testosterone. However, liver
biopsy [**3-3**] showed mild steatosis without balloon degeneration /
intracellular hyalin, and mild portal/lobular mononuclear cell
inflammation. Chronically elevated CPK is not currently
explained as far as we can find.

Social History:
[**Hospital3 4298**] ([**Location 93951**]) resident. Married. 2 children
(daughter, son) in their early 20s. Smoked 8 years, quit 25
years prior. No history of IVDU. Distant history of
polysubstance abuse. Goes to 12-step groups. Works as [**Location (un) 7453**] representative of Invisible Fence, also as bus driver

Discharge


Pertinent Results:
Echo #1: 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium is elongated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess given marked resting tachycardia, but may be
mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %). The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Marked resting tachycardia
renders study difficult to interpret. Possibly mildly reduced
global left ventricular function. Recommend repeat evaluation
when heart rate slower. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2103-7-5**], the heart rate is faster. Left
ventricular function is less vigorous.

Echo #2: results pending

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS: 53 with recurrent non-hodgkin's
lympoma currently started new round of chemo presents with afib
RVR.
.
# Rhythm: Aflutter w/ RVR now resolved. In the past the patient
has been on digoxin (stopped) then Toprol Xl 25mg for PAF which
appears to have been discontinued.  Pt had also been on coumadin
which was recently discontinued when PLT began decreasing after
chemotherapy. The patient received TEE and then successful D/C
cardioversion on [**3-19**]. It sucessfully converted to normal sinus
rhythm.  He was continued on heparin gtt for anticoagulation and
was converted to Lovenox for ease of stopping as his platelets
may drop with further treatment. Due to his size, his dose was
titrated to an appropriate factor Xa level.  He will continue
this anticoagualation for 30 days. He was also started on Toprol
XL 25mg for better rate control. He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
 .
# Fever?: Pt had fever to 101.8 several days ago with malaise
but no focal symptoms was seen in [**Hospital3 4298**] and
cultured.  Was started on levofloxacin epirically at that time.
Blood Cx from MV were negative. Ucx negative. An initial CXR was
w/o evidence of PNA but a repeat CXR showed bibasilar
interstitial infiltrates. He was initially broadened to cefepime
after he spiked again but was rapidly switched back to high dose
levofloxacin. He remained afebrile for >24hrs on PO
antiobiotics. He will complete  10 day course and follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# Lymphoma: The patient had dropping counts after his navelbine
and gemcitabine but his nadir was about 1.6K. He was continued
on his allopurinol and his prophylactic bactrim and acyclovir.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**1-29**] days.
