Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness, shortness of breath and chest "tightness".

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD and colonoscopy on [**2183-7-10**].


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 58 year-old female with a history significant for
CAD, anemia (secondary to iron deficiency and bone marrow
"block") and aortic valve replacement in [**2183-3-15**] who
presents with shortness of breath, dizziness, and chest
"tightness."  Five days prior to admission, the pt. went to
receive her weekly arenesp treatment when her HCT was noted to
be 25.3.  She was transfused 2 units PRBCs at that time.  Since
then, she has noted increasing dizziness, shortness of breath,
and chest tightness.  She does not report any BRBPR,
hematemesis, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fevers.  The
pt. collapsed in [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building lobby and was brought to the
ED.  In the ED she was noted to have a hematocrit of 18 and
guiaic positive, black charcoal-consistency stool. She was
started on a protonix drip, given FFP and Vitamin K (to reverse
her coumadin-induced therapeutic INR), and normal saline.
Initially she had systolic blood pressure readings in the 90's
that responded to fluid.  The GI service was consulted and NG
lavage performed which revealed red blood specks in the lavage
fluid.  The GI service felt that the lavage fluid was not
grossly bloody.  Coumadin was discontinued and she was started
on a heparin drip (necessary as the pt. has a mechanical AVR)
and transferred to the intensive care unit.

3. Congestive heart failure - EF 60% on [**2-16**] cardiac
catheterization.

Brief Hospital Course:
* Anemia: The pt. suffers from chronic anemia and is followed by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**].  As per her records, her anemia seems to be
due to a combination of iron deficiency and bone marrow block.
On arrival to the ED, the pt's. hematocrit was 18 and the pt.
was noted to have guiaic positive stool and specks of blood in
the NG lavage fluid, indicating a likely gastrointestinal bleed
as the cause of her presentation.  An upper endoscopy and
colonoscopy were tentatively planned while the patient was in
the ICU, however, she happened to rule in for an MI on the basis
of cardiac enzymes.  Therefore, the procedure was tentatively
deferred pending cardiac evaulation in this patient with a
previous history of three-vessel coronary disease.
In the ED and ICU, she received a total of five units of PRBCs.
Her hematocrit responded appropriately and trended up from 18 to
21, 24, 29 and 31 over the course of the first and second
hospital day.
The pt. was noted to have a low haptoglobin and high LDH on
laboratory studies, suggesting a possible hemolytic component to
her anemia.  Unfortunately, a peripheral smear was not reviewed
until after the pt. had received transfusions and was therefore
unremarkable.  A Coombs test was performed and was negative. It
is likely given her St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve that there is some
degree of blood cell shearing.  A hematology consult was
obtained.  They recommended laboratory assessment to rule out
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, including flow cytometry
and C55 and 59 antibodies.  This workup proved to be negative.
An EGD and colonoscopy were performed on [**2183-7-10**] which revealed
areas of nodularity and erythema in the stomach suggestive of
gastritis and a normal colonoscopy. No areas of active or recent
bleeding were noted. Biopsies were taken from the erythematous
areas in the stomach and duodenum and review by pathology
determined that they were normal specimens.
As the pt. did experience a drop in hematocrit (to 30-31) after
warfarin was restarted and was noted to have guiaic positive
stool, GI was reconsulted and a capsule endoscopy was performed
on [**2183-7-23**].  This revealed bright red blood in the proximal small
bowel.  A push enteroscopy was then scheduled once the pt's INR
normalized. During the interval when the bleeding was discovered
in the small bowel by capusle endoscopy and the push
enteroscopy, the pt. required frequent transfusions of packed
red blood cells for falling hematocrits (in the low 30's).  The
pt. had the push enteroscopy performed on [**2183-7-30**] which showed
locatlized granularity and erythema in the gastric fundus
compatible with gastritis but an otherwise normal EGD to the
jejunum.
As the pt. did experience a drop in her hematocrit while on
aspirin, plavix and coumadin, it was decided that the pt. should
not take aspirin and plavix secondary to their propensity to
cause gastrointestinal bleeding.  It is realized that she does
need to be on life-long coumadin therapy because of her
mechanical heart valve.  In addition, the pt. was maintained on
high dose protonix (80mg [**Hospital1 **]) as it was noted that she did have
significant gastritis on EGD despite therapy with protonix 40mg
[**Hospital1 **].
After the pt. had had stable hematocrit values and did not
require transfusion for three consecutive days after the push
enteroscopy, warfarin was re-started and she was discharged once
her INR was greater than 2.0.  She was asked to follow-up with
her primary care doctor after having a CBC, PT, PTT, INR drawn
three days after discharge.
The pt. has been scheduled for a follow-up appointment with her
hematologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] on [**2183-8-20**].

* Aortic Stenosis: An echocardiogram performed on [**2183-7-2**]
revealed an aortic paravalvular leak and normal EF with no w
