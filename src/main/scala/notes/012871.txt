Brief Hospital Course:
51F with h/o HCV/HCV cirrhosis POD10 from liver transplant
admitted with AMS, no clinical or radiographic evidence of graft
rejection / portal vein compromise in setting of leukocytosis,
renal insufficiency,and anemia. She was admitted to Transplant
Surgery (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]and pan cultured. IVF resuscitation for
hyponatremia was administered. Broad spectrum antibiotics were
given. CT abd/pel was done to assess for intraabdominal
pathology. This demonstrated a lesser sac fluid collection
adjacent to the pancreas.  A smaller fluid collection was seen
anterior to the stomach deep to the left anterior abdominal
wall, which did not communicate with the lesser sac collection.
Dilated loops of small bowel with no focal transition point were
noted. Fluid collection was unable to be drained by radiology.
Post-transplantation immunosuppressive regimen continued.

Hct was 21. She was transfused with HCT increase to 27. This
remained stable. Sodium was 125. IV NS at 75 was continued with
improvement of serum sodium to 130. An NG was placed for emesis
and KUB demonstrated dilated small bowel. TPN in addition to  NS
was started. Feeding tube was placed.

Neuro was consulted for confusion, insomnia, hallucinations and
twitching. Head CT was done and was negative for acute
intracranial abnormality. Neuro status was most likely a
metabolic/toxic encephalopathy with features of an agitated
delirium. Steroid psychosis was suspected that may have been
exacerbated by SSRI. Effexor was stopped and Zyprexa given.  The
twitching/myoclonus could not be explained by steroid
side effects. Tacrolimus was a potential culpert and dose was
lowered. Mental status improved.

Nausea/vomiting resolved. Diet was advanced and tolerated.
Appetite and po intake were excellent.  TPN was stopped and
feeding tube feeds was removed. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and
recommended continuing NPH 10 units qam with humalog sliding
scale.

Vanco & Zosyn were given [**10-16**] thru [**10-22**]. Cultures (blood/urine
and stool)remained negative.

PT declared her safe for home with rolling walker. She was
discharged to home. Care Group VNA 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 14297**] for NSG, PT,
OT, HHA was arranged.
