Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 40 yo male with h/o asthma transferred from OSH
after intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. Per report,
patient went to work and was on break when he came out of the
bathroom with his inhaler, passed out, was reportedly apneic by
his co-workers and subsequently vomited feculant appearing
vomitus. He could not be intubated in the field, so he was
bagged and had ? seizure described as rhythmic movements arm and
head and was incontinent of urine. On arrival to the ED at OSH,
T 96.1, HR 140s, BP 198/112, O2 sats 86% on ambu bag. He was
sedated and intubated and an NG tube was placed which yielded ?
feculent material. CT head, CTA chest and CT abd were performed.
He received levofloxacin 500 Iv x1, flagyl 500 IV x1, ativan 2
mg IVx3, morphine 10 mg IVx3 and was started on propofol drip
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was intubated and sedated satting 100 %
on AC TV 560/16 100% FiO2 and Peep 5. NG tube in place with
hemeoccult positive output. On speaking with his wife, over the
past 2 months has has been using his inhalers increasingly, at
times multiple times per day. He saw his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 5 days ago at
which time he was started on advair and prednison taper x 7
days. She reports that he had no fevers, chills, cough, URI sx,
abd pain, N/V, diarrhea or any other symptoms. He did have a
coughing spell 2 days ago during which he nearly vomited. His
only recent travel was to [**State 108**] from [**3-26**]. No sick
contacts. Of note, they have been remodeling their home and
paiting and sanding which may have made his asthma symptoms
worse. Denies use of NSAIDS.


Past Medical History:
Asthma- never hospitalized, only on steroid a couple of times
per wife. Until recently only used inhalers occasionally
Occasional GERD treated with PRN Tums


Social History:
Lives with wife. [**Name (NI) 1403**] as corrections officer. Has been using
chewing tobacco for the past 9 months. occasionally smokes
cigars. No cigarette. Drinks socially. No other drugs. (all

Pertinent Results:
[**Location (un) 620**] (OSH) CT head: negative for bleed or mass effect
[**Location (un) 620**] (OSH) CTA: not optimal PE is study, but no obvious PE,
minimal atelectasis on right, evidence of aspiration versus
aspiration PNA
CT abd (prelim): no acute pathology
.
EKG: Sinus tachy 125, nl axis, nl intervals, no ST T wave
changes


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 72442**] is a 40 yo male h/o asthma with recent exacerbation
transferred from OSH intubated after hypoxic respiratory failure
possibly secondary to aspiration event in the setting of asthma
exacerbation.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given recent events with
increasing need for MDIs and coughing fit 2 days ago with near
vomiting, it is possible that the patient had an asthma
exacerbation, hyperventilated, fainted, and had an aspiration
event leading to his intubation. He had no wheeze on exam on
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and does not seem acutely bronchospastic which
doesn't support this picture. There is evidence of pneumonitis
on CT scan at [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 18**]. No evidence of PE, although not an
optimal study, although this is lower on the differential given
his history. The patient was successfully extubated on [**4-13**] and
was stable on 3 L NC, later weaned to RA without problem.  [**Name (NI) **]
was conservatively treated with levofloxacin and flagyl for
possible aspiration PNA, although he may in fact have only
aspiration pneumonitis.  He was also treated with aggressive
nebs, singular, and a slow steroid taper to continue over 2
weeks after discharge.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
pulmonary clinic in the next available appointment slot. He will
have outpatient PFTs checked at that time.
- Interestingly, the patient had continued tachycardia
throughout his stay even after marked improvement with the above
treatment. Given his recent plane ride to [**State 108**] we decided to
repeat his CTA chest.  This study revealed a segmental PE. The
patient was started on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] and was discharged with this
treatment with instructions to call his PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] to set up
a coumadin regimen. He should take lovenox as a bridge to
anticoagulation, then should be anticoagulated on coumadin for a
total of at least 6 months.
.
# Hemoccult positive NG output: On admission the patient was
found to have NG tube output which was hemoccult positive. His
HCT remained stable. He has no history of GI bleed, does have
some mild GERD, denies NSAID or excessive alcohol use. He was on
steroids, which increases his risk of gastritis.  The patient
was kept on a twice daily PPI while in house and is discharged
on a daily PPI for gastritis.  This may be further worked up as
an outpatient if indicated when he follows up with his PCP.
.
At the time of discharge the patient was able to ambulate while
on room air without desaturation. He will follow up with his PCP
and in our pulmonary clinic as above.
