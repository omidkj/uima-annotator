Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2110-2-11**] Mitral valve replacement
[**2110-2-17**] permanent pacemaker insertion


History of Present Illness:
75 year old female with history of mitral regurgitation and
chronic atrial fibrillation. Serial echocardiograms have shown
worsening mitral regurgitation and mitral valve prolapse and
increased pulmonary hypertension. In preparation for mitral
valve surgery, she underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed no significant coronary artery disease. She is referred
for mitral valve repair/replacement.  She is admitted today for
PAT and heparin after a coumadin washout.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   75 year old woman with heart block s/p dual chamber PM.
Assess lead placement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   lead placement



Final Report
HISTORY: Pacemaker placement.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-14**], there has been
placement of a
pacemaker device with leads extending to the right atrium and
apex of the
right ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax. Other than
somewhat better
lung volumes, there is little change in the appearance of the
heart and lungs.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Eccentric MR
jet. Severe (4+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to the eccentric MR jet, its severity
may be underestimated (Coanda effect).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**12-7**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are myxomatous. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to
the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The 3D views of
the mitral valve show a flail A3 portion of the anterior
leaflet.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass:
The patient is not receiving inotropic support post-CPB.
There is a well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral
position with good leaf
