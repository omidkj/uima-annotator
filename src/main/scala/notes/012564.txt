[**2164-9-20**] - Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
82 year old woman with complex past medical history including
PVD, aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation who has been
experiencing worsening fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and
congestive heart failure. She has had several failed
catheterizations secondary to severe PVD (femoral, radial,
brachial). SHe is now admitted for cardiac catheterization and
surgical management of her valvular and coronary artery disease.


Past Medical History:
Dyslipidemia
Hypertension
aortic stenosis
Mitral regurgitation
PVD
COPD
Depression
Osteoporosis
Chronic systolic dysfunction

Social History:
Sheis retired.  She is edentulous and therefore will not require
dental clearance.  She is a 55-pack year history of smoking.
She quit smoking last year.  She does not use any alcohol at
this time.  She is widowed and speaks only Greek.


Family History:
She has two sisters with hypertension but no premature coronary
disease.

Physical Exam:
On examination, her heart rate was 68.  Respiratory rate was 12.
Blood pressure on the right was 134/50 not taken on the left due
to recent brachial artery attempts at catheterization.  She was
5
feet tall weighing 110 pounds.  Overall, she appeared to be
quite
frail elderly woman in no apparent distress.  She was using a
cane to ambulate.  Skin was warm and dry without any cyanosis or
edema.  She had mild clubbing.  Her head was normocephalic and
atraumatic.  Pupils were equally, round, and reactive to light.
Sclerae were anicteric.  Oropharynx was benign.  She was
edentulous.  Her neck was supple with full range of motion and
no
JVD.  Carotid bruits were present on both sides.  She had
bibasilar crackles left greater than right and barrel chest
consistent with COPD.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm with
a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur and grade I/VI diastolic
murmur with S1 and S2 tones present.  She had right upper
quadrant tenderness today in the office with mild hepatomegaly.
Her extremities were warm and well perfused with very trace
peripheral edema and a little bit of mild clubbing on the left.
She had some ecchymosis of her abdomen from Heparin shots in the
hospital.  She had noted varicosities.  She was alert and
oriented x3 moving all extremities.  Gait slow and steady using
the cane with 4/5 strength.  She had 2+ bilateral femoral pulses
with a bruit present in her left femoral artery, trace DP
bilateral pulses, 1+ bilateral in the PTs, and 2+ bilateral
radial pulses.

[**2164-9-19**] Abdominal U/S
Status post cholecystectomy. Common bile duct is dilated, which
is not an uncommon finding after cholecystectomy.

[**2164-9-24**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior basal
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
6. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Posterior leaflet appears slightly restricted, jet is central.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being AV paced.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the Aortic
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 7 mmHg). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. LV function is unchanged.
3. MR is mild.
4. Other findings are unchanged.

[**2164-9-21**] Carotid duplex ultrasound
1. 80-99% right ICA stenosis.
2. 60-69% left ICA stenosis.
3. High-grade left external carotid artery stenosis.

[**2164-9-20**] Cardiac Catheterization
Showed 80% mid and distal LAD, 60% mid LCX, and a complicated
99% calcified proximal RCA lesion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the hospital on [**9-19**] for
pre-operative workup. Diagnsotic catheterization on [**2164-9-20**]
showed 80% mid and distal LAD, 60% mid LCX, and a complicated
99% calcified proximal RCA lesion. An aortogram was performed at
the end of the procedure and revealed severe aorto-iliac disease
extending into her Profunda and Superficial femoral arteries
bilaterally.  Also on [**2164-9-20**] patient had carotid duplex scans
that revealed severe  80-99% right ICA stenosis, 60-69% left ICA
stenosis and a high-grade left external carotid artery stenosis.
The vascular surgery service was consulted who recommended a
concommittant right carotid endarterectomy. As she had right
upper quadrant tenderness, a right upper quadrant ultrasound was
obtained which showed a dilated common bile duct which was not
an uncommon finding after cholecystectomy. No other
abnormalities were seen. On [**2164-9-24**], Ms. [**Known lastname 7568**] was taken to the
operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement
with a 21-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna aortic valve bioprosthesis, two
vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and a concomitant right
carotid endarterectomy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see
operative notes from both vascular and cardiac surgery for
details. Postoperatively she was transferred to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for further monitoring. Within 24
hours, Ms. [**Known lastname 7568**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was extubated.
She was transfused with PRBCs for postoperative anemia and to
maintain hematocrit near 30%. She initially required atrial
pacing for an underlying junctional rhythm/sinus node
dysfunction, for which beta blockade was initially withheld. She
otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the
SDU on postoperative day two.  On POD 5 the patient developed
atrial fibrillation.  She was treated with lopressor 5mg IVP and
started on lopressor 12.5mg PO.  Approximately one hour after
initiation of therapy, the patient converted to sinus rhythm,
with a long (22second) conversion pause.  The patient's nurse
was in the room, witnessed this long pause, and chest
compressions were initiated.  The patient came to immediately.
Follow up CXR reveals no rib fractures.
