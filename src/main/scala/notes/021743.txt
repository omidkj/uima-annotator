History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 19419**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and
PCI, ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and
recent hospitalization for septic arthritis who was to be
directly admitted for acute renal failure today, but was also
found to be in respiratory distress with an echo significant for
new severe MR and pulmonary hypertension.

Of note the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 20432**] for
septic arthritis, for which she went to the OR for washout and
was started on 6 weeks of Vancomycin/Ceftazidime. During this
admission, her creatinine was increased to 1.6 on admission, and
decreased to her baseline of 1.2 without intervention. Her home
dose of Rapamune was stopped in order to assist in healing after
the procedure, her home Lasix dose was increased to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **],
and her Lisinopril was held on discharge.

On [**3-28**] her tacrolimus level was undetectable, despite being on
3 mg [**Hospital1 **] (on [**3-25**] it had been 2.7). Her creatinine was noted to
increase from 1.2 on [**3-28**] to 1.9 on [**3-31**]. She was supposed to be
a direct admission today, however when EMS picked her up to
bring her to the hospital, she was noted to have respiratory
distress so she was brought to the ED instead of the floor.

Her respiratory distress began two days ago. She states her
dyspnea began suddenly and slowly increased over the two days.
Per her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], she had had recurrent admissions to [**Hospital 7912**] for CHF exacerbations thought to be due to
acutely worsening mitral regurgitation in the setting of
ischemia. She states that her symptoms are similar to the
symptoms she had with previous admissions for heart failure. She
also does note that she had had decreased urine output for the
past few days.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 96 HR 80 BP 113/63 RR 20 Sat
97% on 15L high flow. She was given cefepime and vancomycin due
to concern for pneumonia. There was concern for PE, however she
could not undergo a CTA due to her ARF. LENIs were done, but not
yet read. A TTE was also done to look for evidence of right
heart strain and unexpectedly showed new severe mitral
regurgiation and new pulmonary hypertension. She had crackles on
exam and a BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 20433**] so she was given 40 mg IV lasix for
volume overload. She was placed on BiPAP 8/5 for respiratory
support with some improvement.

Her creatinine in the ED was 2.2. She was given 100 mg of
hydrocortisone for rejection. Plan per renal for her acute
rejection is hydrocortisone 100 mg q8h. She was also given
zofran for nausea.

Currently she feels tired and complains of dyspnea. She denies
chest pain, but does admit to pain in her left ankle of [**9-9**].

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. She does admit to stable 3 pillow orthopnea.
