ECG: Sinus tachycardia at 126 bpm, normal axis, LVH.  ? v4-v6
STD

IMAGING:
CXR ([**1-26**]): Linear area of atelectasis in the left upper lobe
with no acute cardiopulmonary process. Repeat AP and left
lateral radiographs are
recomended.

CTA ([**1-26**]): 1. No aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
2. Indeterminate nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland,
which can be assessed further with a non-emergent thyroid
ultrasound.


Brief Hospital Course:
44 year-old female with a history of asthma, HTN, HLD, GERD who
presents with dyspnea and is admitted to the ICU with sinus
tachycardia.  Likely asthma exacerbation vs. viral infection.

# Dysnpea:  Unclear cause.  By the time the patient arrived to
the ICU on exam her lungs were clear with no wheezes or
crackles.  No [**Location (un) **]. CXR and CTA negative.  On room air currently
without complaint.  Has prior hx of asthma, spirometry in [**5-/2128**]
suggestive of restrictive lung disease.  Received prednisone
60mg x1 in ED, nebs and levoflox.  No s/sx of infection, WBC wnl
though lactate elevated at 5.  Would also consider viral
etiology with temp to 100.3.  Other less likely possibilites
include bacterial PNA given ? of productive cough though does
not appear ill and CXR clear.  Could consider flash pulmonary
edema in setting of hypertension but CXR is clear and patient is
on room air. Last echo in [**2127**] with preserved systolic and
diastolic function without any structural abnormalities so new
heart failure unlikely.

She was treated with atrovent, fluticasone, and albuterol prn
and placed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] taper of po prednisone for another 3 days
of 40 mg prednisone daily for a possible asthma exacerbation
(received 60mg of prednisone in ED).  Her cultures were NGTD.

# Tachycardia:  The patient presented with sinus tach in 120's
even after 4L NS in ED in addition to hypertension.  She had no
PE seen on CTA, no O2 requirement, and was not in pain. Temp to
100.3 in ED, possible viral etiology and hypermetabolic state.
Her tachycardia may have been secondary to nebs received in ED
though she was tachy on presentation in ED. She reports no
missed HTN medication doses so medication withdrawal unlikely.
Patient has thyroid nodule seen on CT not noted on prior CT in
[**2127**].  Patient has rare EtOH use (last use was one month ago) so
EtOH withdrawal very unlikely.  No hx of drug use per patient or
prior records. CE negative x2, EKG without clear evidence of
ischemia.

Overnight her tachycardia trended down to the low 100's.  Her
TSH was low, so a free T4 was checked and was normal at 0.93, so
it is unlikely that her tachycardia was due to hyperthyroidism.

# Elevated Lactate:  Unclear cause, does not appear systemically
infection, not hypotensive.  Did not decrease with fluid
initally.  [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to Metformin use.  When rechecked in
the am, it had decreased to 1.9.

# HTN: The patient was hypertensive to 180's in ED, was
140-160's on transfer to the ICU.  She was continued on her home
meds including lisinopril and amlodipine.  She remained
hypertensive to the 150's in the ICU.  Will have her follow up
for outpatient management of her hypertension.

# Thyroid Nodule:  Unclear significance.  Not noted on prior CT
in [**2127**].  Her TSH was checked and was low at 0.25.  Added on a
free T4 which was normal at 0.93.  Will need outpatient follow
up, likely including an ultrasound of her thyroid.  She has an
appointment scheduled at her primary care physician's office for
early next week.

# Diabetes:  Blood glc was 333 on admission. A1c 7.4% in [**12-13**].
On metformin and glyburide.  Has glc of 1000 in urine, no
ketones.  Her PO medications were held and she was covered with
SSI.  She was continued on her home aspirin.

# GERD: The patient was continued on her home omeprazole.
