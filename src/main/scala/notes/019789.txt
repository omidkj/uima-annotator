CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 70-year-old female with a
history of scleroderma, osteoarthritis, dermatomyositis who
was admitted to an outside hospital back on [**2-24**] with
inability to walk and low back pain, mild fevers, and
questionable stool incontinence in the setting of colchicine.
Was also noted to have a white count of 14,000 and an ESR of
111.  The primary medical team at that point was concerned
for epidural abscess, however, the neurological examination
at that time did not clearly demonstrate evidence for
abscess, and MR of the spine was reported negative for
abscess.  However, this MR showed L3-L4 cord compression and
was seen by Neurosurgery at the outside hospital, which
commented that they felt that this was a diffuse process and
nonfocal, and recommended following up with Rheumatology.

She was given an empiric course of ceftriaxone and
doxycycline at the outside hospital.  She was also scheduled
to get a bone scan, but at that time was found to be in rapid
atrial fibrillation and was sent to the CCU.  She was started
on an amiodarone drip for rate control, and was successfully
cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm.  She was placed on to
Lovenox 60 mg subQ [**Hospital1 **].

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], her
vital signs are stable, but unable to provide any reliable
history.

2. Raynaud's disorder.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.3, blood pressure
140/54, heart rate of 56, respiratory rate of 20, and 94% on
room air.  In general, the patient is sleeping and
comfortable, alert, and oriented to self and place.  HEENT:
anicteric sclerae.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Neck:  No jugular
venous distention and supple.  Cardiovascular examination:
S1, S2 with a regular rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lung examination:  Scattered crackles throughout the lung
fields, no wheezes.  Abdominal examination:  Bowel sounds
present, soft, nontender, nondistended, no guarding,
tenderness, or rebound.  Extremities:  Sclerodactyly with a
swollen left fourth digit.  Neurological examination:
Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Intact strength
bilaterally lower extremities.  No focal deficits.  Back with
positive spinal tenderness at L2-L3.

LABORATORY DATA FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White count 15.6,
hematocrit 32.0, platelets 357.  Sodium 135, potassium 4.7,
chloride 104, CO2 21, creatinine 1.1, digoxin of 1.8, TSH of
1.4.  Blood cultures were no growth to date.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Back pain:  Patient was noted to be disoriented which was
felt secondary to excessive narcotics.  Her narcotics were
discontinued with the resolution in her mental status.  A
Neurology consult was obtained for further evaluation of the
questionable L3-L4 cord compression seen at the outside
hospital MRI scan.  Repeat MR [**First Name (Titles) 7837**] [**Last Name (Titles) 14796**]
degenerative and postoperative changes most prominent in the
lower lumbar spine as well as impingement on the exiting left
L3 root.  There was notable mild disk bulging in the lumbar
spine as well as osseous effusion of the vertebral bodies
with Grade I anterolisthesis of L5 upon S1.

The Neurology Service felt that this compression of L3-L4 was
a chronic process and not consistent with her intact
neurological examination.  However, given the hyperreflexia
of the left side, they recommended pursuing brain MRI.  This
MRI revealed mild microvascular changes in the cerebral white
matter, but no evidence of recent infarct.  The back pain did
not improve throughout her admission.  The Chronic Pain
Service was consulted for palliative treatment with steroid
injection.

A sacrococcygeal steroid injection was performed with
improvement of her low back pain approximately 48-72 hours
later with increase in her daily activities and increased
ambulation as well as significant improvement in her Physical
Therapy.

She will be discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility
for further physical therapy sessions and will only have
Tylenol with codeine as her only narcotic which seemed to
minimize her mental status changes.

2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  The patient was admitted
in normal sinus rhythm, however, during her hospital course,
she reverted back to atrial fibrillation with a ventricular
response of approximately 100-150 beats per minute.  She was
discontinued on her beta blocker for fear of exacerbation of
her scleroderma, and was placed on maximum dose of diltiazem
CD 360 mg po q day, and the patient converted spontaneously
back to normal sinus rhythm.  However, after approximately 72
hours, the patient reverted back to atrial fibrillation.

Flecainide 100 mg po q12h was started, but was not successful
with chemical cardioversion.  She was then brought to the
Electrophysiology Laboratory for transesophageal
echocardiogram and electric cardioversion which was
successful, and reverted her to normal sinus rhythm.  She
continues on diltiazem CD 360 mg po q day as well as
flecainide 100 mg po q12h.  Her Lovenox 60 mg subQ q12h was
continued while she was Coumadin loaded with 5 mg po q hs.
However, it was noted that on the second day of her Coumadin,
she had an INR of 5.4 and her Coumadin was held.  She will
need close followup of her INR as the patient is in acute
rehabilitation.

3. Scleroderma:  The patient was admitted with IV steroids
for her scleroderma.  A Rheumatology consult was obtained for
optimization of her steroids.  They recommended following a
hand x-ray to further evaluate the swelling of the left
fourth digit which revealed extensive soft tissue
calcifications, joint space narrowing, sclerosis, and
subluxations in the DIP and PIP joints consistent with
scleroderma.

Her IV steroids were changed to po prednisone and was tapered
10 mg po q day down to her baseline of 10 mg of prednisone po
q day.  She is to followup with her rheumatologist once
discharged from her acute rehabilitation facility.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  [**Hospital3 4419**] in [**Location (un) 6251**],
[**State 350**].

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  She was to followup with her primary
care physician and her rheumatologist, as well as her
cardiologist upon discharge to her acute rehab facility.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Calcitriol 0.25 mcg po q day.
2. Calcium carbonate 500 mg po tid.
3. Amoxil 175 mcg po q day.
4. Tylenol with codeine 1-2 tablets po q6h prn.
5. Diltiazem 360 mg po q day.
6. Flecainide 100 mg po q12h.
7. Prednisone 10 mg po q day.
8. Lisinopril 10 mg po q day.
9. Her Coumadin will be held until her INR is therapeutic
between 2 and 3.

1. Scleroderma.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
