Carotid Bruit :  right bruit vs murmur Left bruit vs murmur

Pertinent Results:
[**2177-8-27**] Echo: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left
atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened and
myxomatous. There is flail of both anterior and posterior
leaflets with evidence of torn chordae on both leaflets
prolapsing into the left atrium. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS:
The patient is on infusions of epinephrine (0.02 mcg/kg/min) and
phenylephrine (<1 mcg/kg/min). The repaired mitral valve is not
well visualized from all angles but the leaflets are no longer
flail and coapt better than before. There is now trace mitral
regurgitation without evidence of mitral stenosis (gradient 3
mmHg). Mild aortic insufficiency remains. Left ventricular
function remains normal. Normal aortic contours.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted post cardiac catheterization for Heparin
bridge with plan for surgery on  [**8-27**]. The cathetreization
revealed nonobstructive disease and carotid ultrasound was
likewise insignificant. She underwent the usual pre-operative
work-up and on [**8-27**] was brought to the Operating Room where she
underwent mitral valve repair. Please see operative report for
surgical details.

Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Diuresis towards her peroperative weight was instituted and beta
blockade resumed. She was transferred to the floor.

She remained in atrial fibrillation and temporary pacing wires
and CTs were removed per protocols.  Coumadin was resumed witha
target INR of [**2-25**].5.  She was seen by the Physical therapy
service for mobility and strength and ready for discharge on POD
5.
Arrangements were made for family to stay with her around the
clock and her anticoagulation to be managed as preoperatively
