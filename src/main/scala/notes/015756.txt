Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall with loss-of-consciousness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year-old male with a history of CAD, seizure
disorder, remote PE off of anticoagulation, peripheral [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**]
disease with left BKA, Interstitial lung disease NOS with
radiographic evidence of emphysema and is on 2L Home O2, who
presents with fall with resultant head injury and
loss-of-consciousness, followed by chest discomfort upon
regaining consciousness. Patient was in usual state of health
until 17:00 on [**2128-4-10**] when he was reaching toward a top shelf
in his apartment, states he lost his balance, and fell,
remembers landing on his left lower extremity stump, remembers
hitting his head, and losing consciousness. Prior to
loss-of-consciousness, patient denied any
presyncope/lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath,
or chest discomfort. He awoke spontaneously approximately at
19:15 and noticed a sharp epigastric discomfort, [**5-25**],
non-radiating, associated with nausea and shortness of breath,
that was relieved 30 minutes later after taking 1 sublingual
nitroglycerin. Patient continued to have severe pain in his
left-lower extremity stump. He had another episode of chest
discomfort at 03:00 on [**2128-4-11**] that resolved in 45 minutes
with 3 sublingual nitroglycerin. Subsequently, this morning,
because the pain in his left-lower extremity continued to
persist and was severe, patient called his brother who [**Name2 (NI) 4662**]
him to the emergency room.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T:98.9, BP:79/48, HR:90, RR:14,
O2Sat:93% on 4L. He was found to have acute renal failure,
creatinine 0.9=>3.6 and was given 2 litres of normal saline.
Given the head trauma, CT head showed no acute intracranial
pathology. Also, patient had transaminitis and gall bladder
ultrasound was performed. VQ scan was performed given history of
PE and inability to perform CTA due to renal insufficiency. Left
knee plain film was also obtained. Given elevation of troponin
and Creatinine Kinase, outpatient cardiology coverage for Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16801**] was notified and advised against initiating
heparin at this time given marked impairment in renal function
making troponin unreliable, and small MB index despite large CK
elevation, suggesting against cardiac aetiology of biomarker
elevation. Patient's lactate was checked in the ED and came down
from 4.1=>2.6 after 2 litres of fluid. He was given 1 dose of
levofloxacin 750mg for possible infiltrate on chest x-ray. Also
given ASA 325 mg PO x1 and Morphine 2 mg IV x1. SBP improved to
110-140 after 2 L NS. He was noted to be guaiac positive.
.
He reports that he has had no chest pain since [**4-10**]. He denies
SOB but does report DOE after [**12-17**] blocks. He denies PND and
orthopnea (but chronically useas 2 pillow at night). He denies
ankle edema. He reports pain in his L BKA.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, vision changes,
headache, rash or skin changes.
