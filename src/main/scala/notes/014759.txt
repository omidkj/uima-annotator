Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis
Red Blood Cell Transfusion


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with CAD s/p DES to RCA,
dCHF, HTN, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and PVD, who presented to her
PCP today with chest discomfort. She has had chest discomfort
since 9pm one day PTA, which spread across her chest from
shoulder to shoulder. It was worse with any movement, especially
with lying down, and improved with sitting up and staying still.
She did have mild SOB [**3-15**] pain on inspiration, and she found it
suffocating while she had her CPAP on overnight. This morning
she continued to have pain, as well as some radiation to the
back. The pain is different from her angina and from the pain
she experienced with her heart failure. At worst it was [**11-20**]
this morning, and at best [**5-21**]. She did not have any associated
nausea, lightheadedness, or diaphoresis. She went to see her
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] found "a change on the ECG" so she was sent to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by paramedics, and received ASA 324mg and SL NTG
x2sprays en route. On arrival she had increased pain with
transfer from gurney to stretcher, and was found to have ST
elevations in II, III, aVF. Her cardiac enzymes were negative
(CK 24, trop <0.01), but she received a Plavix load and was
started on heparin and integrillin gtts and transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] cath lab for emergent cardiac catheterization for STEMI.
Her VS prior to transfer included BP 105/75 and SaO2 97% on 3L.
.
On arrival to the cath lab here, her ECG was felt to be more
consistent with pericarditis. STAT TTE showed a small to
moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion (~2cm in
subcostal view, anterior to the RV) with sustained RA collapse
c/w low filling pressures or early tamponade, and RV collapse
could not be excluded. She reportedly did not have any wall
motion abnormalities. Cardiac cath was cancelled, and urgent
pericardiocentesis was not done. She is being admitted to the
CCU for closer monitoring.
.
Of note, the patient had "allergy" symptoms yesterday prior to
developing the chest pain. Her symptoms included nasal
congestion and rhinitis, as well as anorexia, but she denies any
cough, rash, fevers, chills, sweats, arthralgias, or myalgias.

PERICARDIAL FLUID Procedure Date of [**2128-7-28**]
DIAGNOSIS: Pericardial Fluid:

  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

  Numerous neutrophils and lymphocytes.

.
========================================================
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2128-7-27**] at 6:17:09 PM
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. There is sustained right
atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early
tamponade.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2128-7-28**] at 2:48:59 PM
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Trivial pericardial effusion. Increased PCWP.
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-7-27**], the
pericardial effusion has largely resolved.
.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2128-7-29**] at 3:10:53 PM
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a small pericardial
effusion localized posterior to the left ventricle. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
