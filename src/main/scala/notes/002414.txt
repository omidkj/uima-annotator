ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM (CONTINUED):

1.  SICKLE CELL C DISEASE AND THROMBOCYTOPENIA ISSUES:
Hematology was consulted again regarding the resumption of
the hydroxyurea.  At this time, they are recommending that we
continue to hold off on the hydroxyurea.  The patient has an
appointment with her hematologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] Samoan) on
[**2140-7-14**] and will continue to follow up with him in the
clinic regarding this issue.

2.  RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The final Renal recommendations
were to start the patient both on Phos-Lo and Renagel for
phosphate binding.

She had a trough vancomycin level of 15.3 on [**2140-7-12**]
and was dosed with 1 g of vancomycin on [**2140-7-13**].  She
should continue to be therapeutic until at least [**2140-7-17**].  She will undergo midline placement for administration
of her ceftazidime which should still be administered every
day until [**2140-7-17**].

3.  ALTERED MENTAL STATUS ISSUES:  Briefly, during the
Intensive Care Unit stay before the patient was extubated and
after the patient had begun dialysis, she still remained very
sleepy and difficult to arouse.

Because of the setting of the low platelets, the patient was
sent for a computed tomography scan of the head to insure
that there was no intracranial process accounting for her
decreased level of consciousness.  The computed tomography of
the head showed an essentially normal computed tomography
scan; although, there was a question of a hypodensity within
the frontal lobes bilaterally, which was not specific in
pathology but was potentially consistent with a hypoxic
injury.

The patient did wake up fully after extubation and dialysis
and continued to be appropriate.  She was conversing
appropriately with her family, and no further studies were
done to follow up on that radiographic finding.

4.  NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient did have a Speech and
Swallow evaluation and was found to pass her video swallow
test.  Therefore, the patient was placed on a soft diet with
thin liquids.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis).
 2.  Diastolic heart failure.
 3.  Sickle cell/hemoglobin H disease.
 4.  Pulmonary hypertension (on home oxygen).
 5.  Cirrhosis secondary to iron overload.
 6.  Gout.
 7.  Hypertension.
 8.  Depression.
 9.  Reactive airway disease.
10.  History of neutropenia secondary to hydroxyurea.
11.  Status post cholecystectomy.
12.  Ongoing Acetobacter and methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia; under treatment.
13.  Recent Klebsiella urinary tract infection in the
Intensive Care Unit.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Ursodiol 300 mg p.o. once per day.
 2.  Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. once per day.
 3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once per day.
 4.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. twice per day.
 5.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times per day.
 6.  Phos-Lo 1334 mg p.o. three times per day (with meals).
 7.  Renagel 800 mg p.o. q.a.c.
 8.  Vancomycin (dosed by level when trough is less than 15;
to be given by dialysis).
 9.  Ceftazidime 1 g intravenously q.24h. (to end on [**7-17**]).
10.  Home oxygen nasal cannula at 2 to 4 liters per minute.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to have a follow-up appointment with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] Samoan in Hematology/Oncology on [**7-14**].
2.  The patient also had an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 106568**] in
the Liver Center on [**2140-7-15**].
