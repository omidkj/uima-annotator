Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19193**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed/Acute renal failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD - [**2111-8-28**]

History of Present Illness:
77 y/o M with history of DM, HTN, afib on coumadin, PVD c/b
right sided arterial ulcer s/p surgical debridement on [**8-18**] who
presented with lethargy and hypotension.
.
Patient was in USOH until Tuesday when he began to feel
fatigued. Reported dark black hard stools at that time without
BRBPR. Denied abdominall pain and nausea/vomiting. As week
progressed, continued to feel lethargic and started having
shortness of breath. Also had LH. Had BM on Thursday which was
also dark black and without BRBPR. VNA saw patient Thursday and
noted BPs were in 80s/40s (normal is 130s/70s). Repeat BPs taken
on family were also in 80s and so patient was taken to OSH.
.
In OSH ED, patient was noted to have Hct 17, INR 5.7 and Cr of
7.0. Rectal exam showed heme-positive stool. Patient was given 2
units of pRBCs, 1 unit of FFP, 10mg of vitamin K, D50, 10 units
of regular insulin Calcium gluconate 4g, Protonix 80mg IV, and
Kayexalate 30g. BPs ranged from 86-121/27-65 with HRs in high
40s. EKG was notable for QRS 202 with RBBB and LAFB. With 2
units of pRBCs, repeat Hct was 22.8. Patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment. Prior
to transfer patient was started on a 3rd unit of pRBCs.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, Hct was 23.2, Cr was 6.2 with K of 6.7. Patient was
given a total of 4g of calcium gluconate, insulin 10 units, and
1 amp of D50. Was also started on protonix gtt. NGL was
completed and showed ?coffee grounds. GI and renal were
consulted. Patient rec'd total of 1LNS and had 250cc of UOP. BPs
in ED ranged from 96-107/45-54 with HRs in 48-52. Patient was
noted to desat and was placed on 4LNC. Patient was then
transferred to MICU for further care.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 24996**] on
vascular surgery for elective fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass. Patient went to OR
on [**8-18**] however procedure was aborted after posterial tibial
artery was found to be occluded. Instead surgical debridedment
of arterial ulcer on right ankle. Patient did not receive
contrast durign this hospitalization however was started bactrim
prior to discharge.
.
On MICU, patient was resting comfortably and was hungry.
Otherwise had no complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old male with h/o diabetes, CKD III,mild aortic
stenosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,and severe PVD with
chronic R malleolar arterial ulcer, s/p recent debridement, who
had been on on aspirin/plavix, and coumadin for AFib, who was
admitted soon after his home VNA found him hypotensive. He was
found to have profound anemia from a [**Month/Day/Year 24997**] lesion in the 3rd
part of the duodenum and hospital course complicated by poorly
controlled atrial fibrillation and new ARF secondary to
hypovolemia induced ATN. See below for additional problem based
hospital course.
.

1. GIB: Patient was admitted to the ICU for concern of upper GI
bleed, given h/o duodenal bleeding. In total, pt received 5u
PRBC's (3 at outside, 2 here), 2u FFP, 1u Plts and Vitamin K for
INR 5.7 at OSH. Hct was 23.2 on admission, was hemodynamically
stable by MICU admission after resuscitation, Hct's were
trended. ASA, Plavix and Coumadin were held. He was continued on
Protonix gtt.

GI did EGD on day of admission with report as above, he had
coffee ground blood in stomach and blood in duodenum with
[**Month/Day/Year 24997**] lesion in 3rd part duodenum and 3 clips were applied.
He received 2u PRBC's after the procedure (5 total) and no
further bleeding was seen, and his Hct stabilized. Hct reached
as high as 29.3 during the admission and he was discharged with
a stable Hct of 28.4. We discussed the patient's anticoagulation
with the GI team and Vascular Surgery and they collectively
agreed that we discontinue his ASA and Plavix until follow-up
with GI specialist Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**] given the recent bleed.  On
discharge, we will be sending him home on 3MG/day of Coumadin
monotherapy for his Atrial Fibrillation, giving his CHADS2 score
of 4.  He will follow-up with INR monitoring and general
anticoagulation with his PCP Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16258**] on [**2111-9-9**].


2. Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.5-1.9, was 6.2 with K 6.7
on ED evaluation. He was treated for hyperK as below. Renal was
consulted who saw muddy brown casts indicating ATN likely from
severe hypotension with 80/40s BPs and acute anemia with nadir
HCT 17 range. There was no immediate need for renal replacement
therapy though given he was improving steadily and UOP was in
acceptable ranges. There was also question of post-obstructive
element given reports that he had a prior Foley in place at OSH
that a nurse had removed, with poor UOP thereafter, in the
setting of known BPH. ACEi, Lasix, [**Last Name (un) **], Bactrim were held as all
could contribute to worse renal funciton. On discharge, we
restarted the Lisinopril at 20 MG/day (down from 60 MG/day) and
his Lasix at 20 MG/day (down from 40 MG/day).  He was making
good urine and his urine output was nearly balanced with intake
fluids (clinically euvolemic), suggesting that these medications
would be well tolerated by his kidn
