History of Present Illness:
77yo F PMHx HTN, several recent episodes of PNA admitted to OSH
with RUQ pain, cough and fever; CT demonstrated RLL PNA as well
as bilateral lower lobe PE; she was initially treated with
lovenox and levofloxacin; her course was complicated by Hct 23
(from 32); she received 2 units pRBCs [**2139-7-31**] w appropriate
rise in Hct to 29; given concern regarding inability to
anticoagulate the patient, she had an IVC filter placed; patient
was subsequently started on coumadin and IV heparin drip;
patient was stable in hospital until [**8-2**] when she gradually
became more dyspnic and tachycardic; abx was changed to zosyn at
this time and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

ECHO
Patient is on Levophed and Neosynephrine. The left atrium is
normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The LV ejection
fraction appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection
fraction ? 30 percent) at least partially as result of right
ventricular predominance and ventricular interaction. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Abdominal ultrasound with Dopplers
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver
disease and more advanced liver disease including significant
hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
.
CXR
ET tube tip is in standard position, 3.8 cm above the carina. NG
tube tip is
out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged
with widened mediastinum due to lymphadenopathy. Cardiac size is
top normal.
Diffuse interstitial and bilateral opacities larger on the upper
lobes
bilaterally and in the left lower lobes are unchanged. They are
a combination
of interstitial edema, multifocal pneumonia superimposed to
emphysema and
probably chronic interstitial lung abnormality. Moderate right
pleural
effusion has increased. Small left pleural effusion is
unchanged.
.
OSH CT Abd/Pelvis - [**2139-7-28**]

pelvic process demonstrated
.
OSH CT Chest w Contrast - [**2139-7-30**]
b/l lower lobe PE, mediastinal and R hilar lymphadenopathy
suspicious for underlying neoplastic process, nonspecific focal
areas of bilateral airspace disease as detailed, bilateral
pleural effusions, R rib fractures
.
OSH Lower Extremity Ultrasound - [**2139-7-31**]
No evidence of DVT on R or L side
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 119bpm, NAD, TWI in V1-3, no ST

[**Hospital3 **] culture data:
[**7-29**] - Bcx no growth (final)
[**8-2**] - Sputum rare normal respiratory flora (final)
[**8-5**] - Urine no growth (final)



Brief Hospital Course:
77yo F with nine day [**Hospital3 **] course notable for findings
of PNA and PE, presenting with worsening hypoxia.
.
# Hypoxia - Patient with progressively worsening hypoxia, with
known PNA and pulmonary emboli on OSH imaging. It was felt that
the patient likely had an underlying infectious process driving
the gradual worsening of her medical condition, especially given
limited community acquired pneumonia treatment at outside
hospital. The pulmonary emboli was felt to possibly be
worsening, precipitating her decline although this was not able
to be confirmed given she was far too ill to travel for a CTA;
this was felt to be less likely in the setting of her
supratherapeutic INR, recent Lovenox administration, and her IVC
filter placement. The patient's ABG showed significant A-A
gradient, her PaO2/FiO2 was suggestive of ARDS as were her CXRs
on admission (bilateral fluffy infiltrates). The patient
developed worsening respiratory distress upon arrival (hypoxia,
shortness of breath, tachypnea) and was intubated/sedated
shortly after presentation. Her antibiotics were broadened to
Vancomycin and Meropenem and cultures drawn (blood, urine,
sputum). There was no growth to date by the time the patient
expired. She was maintained on ARDsnet Protocol but required
paralysis with cisatracurium for high plateau pressures,
dysyncrony with the vent, and high tidal volumes prior to
paralysis.
.
# Sepsis/multiorgan failure - The patient continued to
decompensate with rising lactate, LFTs, INR, creatinine. Her
blood pressures dipped into the systolic 80s and was gradually
broadened to Vasopressin, Levophed and Neosynephrine for
pressors. She was aggressively volume resuscitated and her
pressures were fluid responsive. She was also started on stress
dose steroids. Despite aggressive resuscitation measures,
however, her lactate, LFTs, INR and creatinine continued to
climb. In discussions with the family, she was made DNR/DNI and
ultimately comfort measures only. Pressor support was
discontinued and the patient passed away shortly thereafter,
with her husband, children and extended family at the bedside.
Because of her rapid decompensation, the family requested
autopsy to be performed.

# Tachycardia - The pati
