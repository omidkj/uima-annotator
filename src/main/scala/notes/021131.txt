Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Tx from OSH for Anterolateral [**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary catheterization


History of Present Illness:
81 yo male with h/o CABG x 2 (SVG jump graft to distal RCA and
circumflex and LIMA-LAD), PPM, ICD, CHF with EF 20% transferred
from OSH for anterolateral [**First Name3 (LF) **].
.
The patient presented to OSH with 2 days unstable angina and had
ST elevations on ECG (V1-V4) with ST depressions (V5-V6).  The
patient's CK 364 and Trop 3.86.  He was given Metoprolol 5 mg IV
x 1, [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325 mg, Heparin, Aggrastat, and [**First Name3 (LF) **] 300 and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath and intervention.  His
vitals at transfer were BP 112/65, HR 86, 98% 2LNC
.
The patient had a LHC which showed LAD 100%, LCX 100%, RCA 100%,
SVG- diagonal 99% mid stenosis.  The patient had Bare metal
stent of diagonal graft with 4.0 by 18 Vision stent.  C.I was
1.55 then 1.46 post intervention.  He had elevated filling
pressures but IABP was no placed because of advanced age and
iliac tortuosity.  He was then transferred to CCU for further
monitoring.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, but negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
EKG [**2189-11-26**] at OSH demonstrated NSR with TWI in I and aVL.  ST
elevation in V1-V4 and ST depression in V5-V6.  Post
intervention shows resolution of ST elevations
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2189-11-26**] demonstrated:
Coronary Angiography: Codominant
LMCA:
LAD: 100% origin
LCX: 100% proximal
RCA: 100% proximal
SVG- jump graft to distal RCA and circumflex widely patent, vein
to diagonal with 99% mid stenosis
LIMA-LAD: atretic and not clear if used as conduit
.
Interventional details: Bare metal stenting of diagonal graft
with 4.0 by 18 Vision stent postdilated to 4.5 mm with good
result.  Some slow flow after intevetnio which improved with IC
vasodilators.  Distal protection with Filterwire used for
predilation but was not able to be used during stenting because
of technical problems.
.
TTE ([**2189-11-27**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild apical
aneurysm.. There is moderate to severe regional systolic
dysfunction including hypokinesis of the basal half of the
inferior wall and basal septum and basal anterior walls as well
as akinesis of the more distal segments of the inferior wall,
septum and anterior wall. The remaining segments contract well.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity
enlargement/aneurysm and extensive regional systolic dysfunction
c/w CAD. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate-severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
CXR ([**2189-11-1**]): Comparison is made with prior study dated
[**2189-11-27**]. There has been interval improvement of now
mild pulmonary edema with mild vascular engorgement.  The aorta
is elongated.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Patient is
post-median sternotomy and CABG.  The transvenous
pacemaker leads terminate in standard position in the right
atrium and right ventricle.  Bilateral pleural effusions have
increased in size in moderate amount, right greater than left.
In the left, pleural effusion is tracking through the fissure,
could be loculated.
IMPRESSION:  Improvement in now mild interstitial pulmonary
edema.
Increasing bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right and
probably
loculated on the left.
.
CXR ([**2189-11-2**]):COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of [**2189-12-2**].
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  These are submitted as three
images.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
The left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in standard
position in the right atrium and right ventricle.  There has
been interval decrease to the right pleural effusion which is
small now, and no change to moderate left pleural effusion with
loculation.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Again seen is
a tortuous aorta.  No change is seen to the mediastinal contour.
 No pneumothorax or new pulmonary infiltrates are seen.  No
evidence of congestive heart failure is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Decrease in right pleural effusion and no change to
left pleural effusion and loculation.  No evidence of overt CHF
.
Urine cytology ([**11-26**]):Rare highly atypical but degenerated
urothelial cells, cannot exclude urothelial dysplasia versus
neoplasia. Anucleate squames, histiocytes, casts and numerous
red blood cells.


Brief Hospital Course:
As noted in HPI pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath
and intervention.  His vitals at transfer were BP 112/65, HR 86,
98% 2LNC.  When arriving pt was taken straight to cath lab and
had a LHC which showed LAD 100%, LCX 100%, RCA 100%, SVG-
diagonal 99% mid stenosis.  The patient had Bare metal stent of
diagonal graft with 4.0 by 18 Vision stent.  C.I was 1.55 then
1.46 post intervention.  He had elevated filling pressures but
IABP was no placed because of advanced age and iliac tortuosity.
 He was then transferred to CCU for further monitoring.  Pt was
weaned off the dopamine drip in less than 24 hrs after arriving
to the CCU since he after only a few hrs had impovement of CI
quickly to >2.  Soon thereafter pt was re-started on metoprolol,
likley too soon since pt had dyspnea and CI again <2 (1.78).  BB
was held and dopamine drip started briefly for a few hrs.  Pt
was in the meantime slowly uptitrated on ACEI t
