Pertinent Results:
Intra-operative echo
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis in
the entire LAD, RCA distribution.Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=20 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is mild TR and the Tricuspid annulus measures 4.0cm
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 84314**]
before surgical incision.

POST-BYPASS:
On epinephrine and levophed,
Overall LVEF 20%. RV mild global systolic dysfunction.
Intact thoracic aorta.
Valves similar to prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2173-12-6**] Mr. [**Known lastname 84315**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a coronary artery bypass
grafting times three (LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag, SVG to PDA).
This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  Please see
the operative note for details.  He tolerated this procedure
well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit.  He was extubated and weaned from
his drips.  His chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed.
He was transferred to the surgical step down floor.  Coumadin
was restarted for his left ventricular apical thrombus.  He was
seen in consultation by the physical therapy service.  He
experienced some asymptomatic hypotension and but tolerated
minimal doses of beta blockade and ACE inhibitor.  By
post-operative day five he was cleared for discharge to home by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on Dr.[**Name (NI) 5572**] behalf.  All follow-up appointments
were advised.
