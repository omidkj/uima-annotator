Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
L medullary bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 66 year old right handed woman with a history
of mechanical MVR on Coumadin, atrial fibrillation s/p PPM, DM
on insulin pump, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF, and COPD who
presents with left upper and middle back pain and SOB s/p fall
Saturday morning with head CT showing hemorrhage in the left
medulla and small focus of SAH.

The patient reports that on Saturday [**2-18**] at 3:00 am, she woke
up to use the restroom which she often needs to do since she is
on Lasix. While walking back to bed, she tripped over a metal
garbage can and fell on top of the trash can. She landed on her
left side and back, and did not initially think she hit her head
and denied LOC. She got back in to bed to sleep. She woke up
Saturday morning, and had left sided mid back pain which was
[**3-9**] in intensity and worse with movement. She did not take any
medications for this because she was concerned it would interact
with her other medications. She woke up Sunday morning with
worsened back pain which was up to [**7-9**] in intensity. She also
noticed a contusion in her left posterior head, which she had
not seen before. She complained of being more short of breath
than usual, so her daughter called urgent care and took her to
the ED.

On ROS, she denied headache, lightheadness, dizziness,
nausea/vomitting, weakness/numbness, diplopia/blurry vision,
dysarthria, or dysphagia.

She initially presented to [**Hospital1 **], where vitals on admission
were bp 126/77, HR 60, RR 20, temp 98.9, SaO2 95% on RA. Her
exam was "speaking in full sentences, contusion in left
occipital region, tenderness to palpation of left posterior
chest wall, no vertebral point tenderness or step-offs, cranial
II-XII wnl, motor, sensory and cerebellar functions normal."
Labs showed Hct
35.2, WBC 6.6, plt 198, Na 135, Cr 0.92, INR 2.6. Per report,
head CT showed an 8 mm bleed in the left medulla. CT
abdomen/pelvis was ordered to rule out retroperitoneal bleed
which was preliminarily negative. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in cardiology
recommended 2 U FFP, which was given. She also received Percocet
2 tabs PO x1. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

At [**Hospital1 18**], Head CT wet read showed similar appearing hemmorhagic
posterior medulla focus, possible slightly increased anterior
medulla hemmorhagic focus. no evidence of herniation, and small
focus of subarachnoid hemmorhge likely unchanged. Neurosurgery
was consulted who thought that the bleed was due to a cavernous
malformation in medulla with acute blood. She did complain of
nausea after laying down for the head CT. She currently denies
back pain. She received Zofran 4 mg IV x1, and since her repeat
INR was 2.2 she was scheduled to receive another 2 U FFP.

Past Medical History:

to 18, s/p endoscopy, colonoscopy, and capsule endoscopy wihtout
source of bleed, Hct been back up to 35 over past 5-6 weeks
Osteoporosis

Social History:
She moved in with her daughter in [**Name (NI) 205**]. She has had recent falls
at home, and 4 months ago broke her wrist when falling over an
open dishwasher door. She is retired from customer service in
AAA. She smoked 2 ppd for 40 years, but quit
10 years ago. She denies EtOH or illicit drug use.

right-left confusion. No evidence of apraxia or neglect.

Cranial Nerves: Fundoscopic examination reveals sharp disc
margins. Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 5 to 3 mm
bilaterally. Visual fields are full in all 4 quadrants.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally with 2-3 beats of
nystagmus at left end-gaze. Sensation intact V1-V3. Facial
movement symmetric. Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 66 year old right handed woman with a history
of mechanical MVR on Coumadin, atrial fibrillation s/p PPM, DM
on insulin pump, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF, and COPD who
presents with left upper and middle back pain and
SOB s/p fall Saturday morning with head CT showing hemorrhage in
the left medulla and possible small focus of SAH.

She reports a mechanical fall over a garbage can 2 days ago, and
then developed left sided back pain, and presented to an OSH
with SOB. Head CT there showed an 6 mm
medullary hemorrhage, and she received 2 U FFP for INR 2.6.  Her
INR on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] was 2.2 hence received 2 more units of
FFP and repeat head CT showed no change.

She had no lateral medullary finding including vertigo,
hemisensory findings (ipsilateral face and contralateral
hemibody for pain and temperature) or ataxia.  She does have
slight L sided dysmetria with FTF and HTS.  She also had no
nausea or headache but did have significant left sided back
pain.  She was initially admitted to ICU where she remained
stable with no further deterioration and CTA (MRI unable to be
obtained due to pacemaker) showed no obivous vascular
malformation.

Her hemorrhage most likely cavernoma with bled due to trauma and
the fact that she is anticoagulated hence more
