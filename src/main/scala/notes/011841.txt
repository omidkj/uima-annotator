Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22964**]
Chief Complaint:
osteomylitis left knee

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left knee fusion; debridement
CVL Right IJ
A-line

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG,
diastolic CHF, CRI, HTN, DM with recent history of septic left
knee who presented on [**2155-10-30**] for fusion of his left knee and
is now being transferred to the ICU after intraop blood loss
(1500-2000cc) and hypotension requiring pressors.
.
With respect to his complicated joint history, he underwent left
TKA many years ago.  In [**5-22**] he was admitted to [**Location (un) **]
[**Location (un) 1459**] Hopsital for septic arhtritis w/ S. aureus for which
he was d/c on 6 wk course of cetriaxone and rifampin.  The
course thereafter is not entirely clear, however, he presented
to OSH again in [**8-22**] with septic left joint at which time he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and repeat arthrocentesis was performed
with fluid showing 406,000 WBC with 91% PMNs.  He was started on
Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.  Cultures at that time revealed
joint fluid with MSSA but tissue with MRSA.  With consult from
ID, patient was treated with Vancomycin 1gm q48h. He had
hardware removed, washout, and antibiotic spacer placed on [**8-27**]
and he was discharged to complete vancomycin.  He presented
again [**9-5**] with septic left knee joint and underwent repeat
washout with antibiotic spacer placed on [**9-11**].  Subsequently he
reportedly has done "well" with knee immobilization on
vancomycin which he completed on [**2155-10-8**].
.
He presented today for planned elective left knee fusion.  His
pre-op course was reportedly unremarkable.  Intraop, he lost
1.5-2L blood and received a total of 6Units prbcs.  He received
an additional 4L crystalloid.  His MAPs dipped repeatedly
throughout the case in the low 40s and high 30s and he required
multiple boluses of neosynephrine throughout the case.  His UOP
was 100cc throughout the entire case despite the above fluids.
Preop hct was 31.1 and was 31.6 postop after the 6 units prbcs.
Received calcium, insulin, lasix for K+ 6.6 intraop.

Joint Fluid: no growth
Tissue: no growth
Blood Cultures: pending

IMAGING: [**10-31**]
CT-ABD
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse pneumatosis intestinalis with superior mesenteric and
portal
venous gas as well as colonic wall thickening. Overall, this is
very
concerning for ischemic/infarcted bowel.
2. Moderate left and small right pleural effusion.

[**10-31**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild to
moderate regional systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
anterior septum and anterior walls. The remaining segments
contract well. There is no resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Trace aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study of earlier in the day, left
ventricular systolic function is improved.


Brief Hospital Course:
# He presented today for planned elective left knee fusion.  His
pre-op course was reportedly unremarkable.  Intraop, he lost
1.5-2L blood and received a total of 6Units prbcs.  He received
an additional 4L crystalloid.  His MAPs dipped repeatedly
throughout the case in the low 40s and high 30s and he required
multiple boluses of neosynephrine throughout the case.  His UOP
was 100cc throughout the entire case despite the above fluids.
Preop hct was 31.1 and was 31.6 postop after the 6 units pRBC.
The patient's blood pressures were maintained on levophed and
neo.  Additionally, the patient was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics of vancomycin, zosyn and flagyl.  Pt WBC count
continued to rise post-op and on [**10-31**] reached 48.8 with a
lactate of 6.5.  The patient additionally developed melana and a
CT-scan of the abdomin was performed.  The results were
consistent with severe mesenteric ischemia and after lengthy
discussion the family chose to defer further treatment.  The
patient was made CMO and passed at 12:30am on [**2155-10-31**].

 Anemia:  Chronic and thought to be in setting of CKD and MDS
per last admission note.  On epo as outpatient
