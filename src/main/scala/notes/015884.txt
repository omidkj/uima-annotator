Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea/decreased PO


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
66 y/o male with h/o CKD (1.0-1.5), CAD s/p MI, CHF (EF 30%),
PVD, DM2, afib (coumadin) w/ ICD+PM who p/w from rehab with
Acute on CRF (Cr 3.1 BUN 122) in setting of known UTI now in
shock on pressors.
.
This patient has complicated PMH including DM, CAD with
ischemnic CHF, Afib with pacer+ICD on coumadin and more recent
history of right colectomy + iliostomy in [**2128-5-23**] for Cecal
volvulus as well as prolonged IV Abx therapy (~ 15 weeks) for
MRSA sepsis complicated by right intramuscular abscess of
trapezius and polymicrobial diabetic left foot with
osteomyelitis. This was also complicated by renal renal
insufficiency and eosinophilia (up to 10% on [**8-31**] with wbc of
7.2), creatinine was 1.9 at 8/19. Despite prolonged IV therapy
with vanco patient's foot pain and elevated inflammatory markers
persisted and he was planned for podiatry consult for surgical
treatment of his persistent OM. Workup for other sources
included TTE which did not show lead vegetations, RUQ US (d/t
ALKP elevation) which did not show source of infection and left
shoulder US which showed trapezius collection had resolved, IV
Vanco was d/c'ed in setting of renal insufficiency and patient
was put on suppressive minocycline therapy from [**9-14**]. Per ID
notes he was also recently briefly on Penicillin for unknown
indication.
.
On [**9-24**] patient began to have nausea, decreased PO and decreased
appetite and found to have UTI per positive UA (13 wbcs, pos
nitrites, 3+leuk esterase) and Ucx (>100,000 Proteus r to cipro,
levoflox, nitrofurantoin, sensitive to amikacin, amp, augmentin,
cefazolin, cefepime, cefoxitin,ceftriaxone, gent, tobra,
trim/sulfa, 10 to 30,000 GNR no sensitivities.) Also found to
have worsening renal failure BUN: 118, Creat: 2.8. Per ID notes
minocycline was held and he was started bactrim to target the
proteus, the unspeciated GNR and for staph suppression, with
plan to then resume minocycline after completing 7 day course of
bactrim. Lasix was discontinued and pt was treated with PO
fluids.
.
In the ED: Admission vitals were 97.0 60 95/51 16 100% 2L, labs
showed hyperkalemia to 6.1, HCO3 = 13 w/o elevated gap, Cr/BUN
3.3/131 with FeUrea = 34% FeNa = < 0.5%, No leukocytosis, mild
thrombocytopenia to 128 which is new. UA was mildly positive for
leukocytes and bacteria. CE were negative. CXR was non acute.
Patient recieved kayexalate, calc gluconate, insulin, d50 for
hyperkalemia with repeat K = 4.5. Vanc and Zocyn were given at
20:00.
.
Patient initially fluid responsive with SBP 95 which initially
corrected to 113-120 after bolus but then fell to 70's and
received 1L IVF wide open.  Again SBP increased to 100s, and
again fell to 70s.
Has gotten 6L NS + ????1-2L???.  R-IJ placed.  Started on
levophed drip with unknown response.  Patient also became
hypothermic 93-94 po but corrected to 98 on bear hugger.  Sating
well w/ no O2 requirement.

IMAGING:

[**9-27**] CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary process

[**9-28**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior
free wall and posterior wall, and hypokinesis of the inferior
septum. Pacing-induced LV dyssynchrony is present. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well
seen. The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**9-28**] Chest US: No evidence of abscess in the left trapezius
muscle or over the left cardiac pacemaker site.

[**10-4**] LUE US:  no DVT
