History of Present Illness:
75M with a history of atrial fibrillation, HTN, diastolic heart
failure, ESRD s/p renal transplant in [**2176**], CAD s/p 2-vessel
PCI/DESx2 in [**3-/2178**], possible new inferolateral reversible
defect on p-MIBI in [**12/2178**], worsening  exertional CP/SOB over
the last month. He also complains of significant claudication
symptoms. He describes the chest pain as sub-sternal,
squeezing/sharp with radiation to his arms. He has been
pre-medicating himself with nitroglycerin prior to exertion. He
also complains of orthopnea, PND and cough productive of whitish
sputum. He has been experiencing abdominal pain for the past
month (RUQ) a/w mild nausea, no vomiting/diarrhea/constipation.
History of mild dilation of distal aorta. No recent long travel,
no recent surgeries. Came to ED today because granddaughter
called his cardiologist who recommended evaluation. He denies
fevers, chills, and diaphoresis.

In the ED, initial vitals were 99 75 155/70 18 95% RA. No new
EKG changes. Labs significant for TnT 0.05, CK:MB 135:3, BUN/Cr
35/2.2, proBNP 3083 and INR 1.1. The patient was totally chest
pain-free in the emergency department. Patient given aspirin
81mg x 4. Vitals on transfer were 58 110/85 24 96%.

On arrival to the floor, the patient is borderline tachypnic and
in mild respiratory distress. He is actively wheezing,
complaining of orthopnea and PND.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence syncope or
presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM
[**2179-10-23**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction
c/w CAD. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-1-30**],
regional wall motion abnormalities are new and systolic function
is not as vigorous.
.
[**2179-10-25**] Cardiac Cath:
1. LMCA and three vessel heavily calcified coronary artery
disease, progressed from [**2178-3-3**], with moderate in-stent
restenosis of the OM1 stent, mild in-stent restenosis of the AV
groove CX, and stable collateralized chronic totally occlusive
in-stent restenosis of the RCA.
 2. Systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
 3. Moderate-severe left ventricular diastolic heart failure in
the setting of known mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction.
 4. Routine post-TR Band care.
 5. Reinforce secondary preventative measures against CAD,
hypertension, left ventricular systolic dysfunction and
diastolic
heart failure.
 6. Suboptimal imaging due to body habitus.
 7. Cardiac surgery evaluation for suitability for CABG,
although
distal targets are not ideal. There are no lesions appealing for
PCI, and presence of heavily calcified LMCA stenosis extending
past the origin of the LAD is strong relative contraindication
to
PCI.
 8. Heparin infusion without bolus may be resumed in 6 hours as
clinically indicated.

Impression: Right ICA with<40%  stenosis.
            Left ICA with <40%  stenosis.
