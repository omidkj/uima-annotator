Pertinent Results:
[**2134-9-25**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded in addition to
akinetic basal to mid inferior and anteroseptal walls. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF= 35 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
Operating Room on [**2134-9-23**] where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting x3. See operative note for full details. Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.

On POD1 night the patient went into atrial fibrillation briefly
then sustained ventricular tachycardia.  He did not lose
consciousness throughout the episode.  He was bolused with
Amiodarone and transferred to the CVICU, hemodynamically stable
in sinus rhythm. Electrophysiology was consulted.  He remained
in sinus rhythm until the following night when he developed
ventricular tacycardia requiring defibrillation x 4, Amiodarone
and Lidocaine boluses and drips, IV Lopressor and overdrive
ventricular pacing with return to sinus rhythm.  The following
day he went into a rapid atrial fibrillation and IV Lopressor
was increased.  He went into a sustained ventricular tachycardia
on the following morning and Amiodarone was bolused and
additional IV Lopressor was given.

Heparin was started for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
 A right chest tube was placed on post operative day 3 for a
pneumothorax.  The lung was rexpanded on the following chest
xray and the chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the Physical
Therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.

An electrophysiology study was conducted on [**10-4**] and VT was
easily induced. The EP attending felt that a defibrillator was
not yet indicated as this might represent reperfusion or scar.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts was arranged, with results to be forwarded to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 81807**].  Amiodarone was tapered over the three weeks
after discharge. By the time of discharge on POD 12 the patient
was ambulating independently, the wounds were healing well and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged to [**Location (un) 931**] House in [**Location (un) 932**] in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions. Coumadin will be managed by
the rehabilitation facility with a goal INR of [**2-16**].5.
