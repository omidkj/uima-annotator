History of Present Illness:
74 year old Female who initially presented with abdominal pain,
and an abdominal CT in the ED was significant for concern for
diverticulitis/colitis at the splenic flexure with some concern
for chronic mesenteric ischemia. She was occult blood positive
on rectal exam. She was started on ciprofloxacina and
metronidazole in the ED. She also notes that the day prior to
admission she had nasuea and vomitting after drinking some
water.

She was also noted with a whole body coarse tremor, with
occaisional myoclonic jerking motions. The family notes this has
begun within the last 3 months, with initiation of steroids for
her ILD, but markedly worsened over the last several weeks. This
has also been accompanied with some cognative decline and some
delerium. A neurology consult was obtained.

The morning after admission however during rounds she proceeded
to have frank hematemesis. Nasogastric lavage was performed with
return of approximately 500ml of blood.

The patient has been undergoing workup and treatment for
interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. She also has a
history of supraventricular tachycardia, and has been on
antyarrythmics for over 10 years.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Hypoxic Resipratory Failure: The patient was transferred to
the floor after her GI bleed was explored and treated with an
endoscopy done by the GI service as described below. Two days
after she was transferred to the floor, the patient was
ambulating with physical therapy. Afterwards she developed
hypoxic respiratory failure becoming tachypneic, with low oxygen
saturations. She was triggered on the floor also for her
hypotension. She was transferred back to the ICU. The patient
was placed on non-rebreather mask and continued to have oxygen
saturations in the low 90s. She developed fatigue and stated
that she was tired. She also started having changes in her
mental status becoming more somnolent. The patient's family as
well as the patient had discussion about code status. It was
determined that she was okay to be resucitated and intubated
however the patient did not want prolong intubation. She was
intubated for airway protection. A central line was also placed
for CVP monitoring as well as pressor administration. She was
kept on pressors. The patient was maintained on the ventilator
and was given diuresis as well as antibiotics with limited
clinical improvement. On the second day after intubation, the
decision was made to terminally extubate the patient and make
the patient CMO with all family members present. The patient was
extubated and in 2 hours because asystolic with no pulses or
respirations. The patient's family declined autopsy. NEOB was
notified. The patient was transferred to the morgue.
.
#. Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to GI Bleeding.  High risk for
GIB given long term prednisone, aspirin, and aspirin containing
medications.  Patient was found to have reddish-brown coffee
ground hematemesis.  Hct was noted to have dropped about 5
points but also in the setting of getting maintenance fluid
since admission.  NGT was placed with continuous brown-red
aspirate of about 500cc as GI was called to evaluate patient for
likely upper GIB, such as [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, given recent
retching, nausea, and vomiting prior to admission.  No BM since
admission.  She has active type and screen until [**5-25**], and a
second IV was placed (18g, 20g).  Aspirin containing medications
were stopped.  She received bolus of pantoprazole then
transitioned to drip.  MICU was called to evaluate for patient
given active bleeding and need for urgent endoscopy by GI with
anesthesiology for possible need for MAC.  Plan to have at least
q8h Hct check with 2 units of crossmatched pRBC standby.  She
was transferred to the MICU and underwent endoscopy, which
showed + erosive esophagitis.  She was kept on high dose PPI
with the plan to have repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks.
.
#. Ischemic Colitis.  History is somewhat difficult to obtain
from patient.  Initial read of CT abd/pelvis suggested
diverticulitis and then later read as colitis.  She was placed
on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole empirically, and kept NPO
initially.  She was noted to have diffuse tenderness in her
abdomen during round with + guarding.  Surgery was consulted
prior to her transfer to the MICU.  She was transferred back on
Unasyn and Flagyl, with unclear reason to the change from [**Name (NI) **]
and Flagyl, ? concern for C. diff, but C. diff was nega
