History of Present Illness:
This [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman has had a non- healing ulcer of his
right posterior heel with exposed Achilles tendon. This is quite
painful. He underwent
arteriography in an attempt at a catheter-based intervention by
cardiology without success. He is open to the level of the below
knee popliteal occluded anterior tibial artery and has distal
anterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery as the only runoff
vessel to his foot

Past Medical History:
1. TIA (daughter is not sure about this)
2. Carotid artery stenosis: Chronically occluded right internal
carotid artery. Left, with 40-59% carotid stenosis.
3. CAD s/p PCI x 2
4. Severe PVD
5. Hypercholesterolemia
6. Hypothyroidism
7. Chronic low back pain
8. AFib s/p ablation
9. s/p cholecystectomy
[**48**]. s/p bilateral carotid endartectomies
11. s/p left popliteal graft
12. s/p left knee arthroscopy
13. s/p lumbar decompression '[**34**]
14. s/p left leg thrombectomy

Social History:
Previous 30 pack-year tobacco, quit 40 [**Year (2 digits) 1686**] ago. Occasional EtOH.
Lived with daughter x 4 [**Name2 (NI) 1686**]. Walks with a cane. Lives in the

HEEL (AXIAL & LATERAL) RIGHT

Reason: evaluate heel ulcer/exposed achilles tendon

HISTORY: Patient with heel ulcer and exposed Achilles tendon.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2146-8-19**].

Since the prior study, the soft tissue ulcer along the posterior
medial aspect of the ankle has increased significantly in size.
There is increased lucency and loss of the cortical white line
involving the margin of the medial malleolus. These findings are
highly suggestive for osteomyelitis. There is no soft tissue
gas. There is prominent swelling medially greater than lateral.
[**Year (4 digits) **] calcifications are seen. There is a plantar spur. The
tibiotalar joint is within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with osteomyelitis involving the
medial malleolus with increase in the soft tissue ulcer and bony
destruction since the previous study

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient:  *55 mm Hg  < 20 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - Valve Area:  *0.8 cm2  >= 3.0 cm2

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Moderate-severe AS
(area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic
valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
