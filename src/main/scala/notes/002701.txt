HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 77-year-old
male with no prior history of coronary artery disease who
presented to an outside hospital with chest pains on [**2176-9-9**].
He had diagnostic catheterization on [**9-11**], which showed
severe three vessel disease after a suboptimal Thallium scan.
The patient at that time also was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction by serial enzymes.  The patient's initial health
state was also complicated by anemia with initial hematocrit
at 20.  Endoscopy on [**9-12**] showed no gastrointestinal bleeds.
The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood
cells, and was stable.

At this point, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for a possible coronary artery
bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Renal cancer status post left nephrectomy in [**2173**]
2.  History of AV block with pacemaker
3.  History of colon polyps and diverticulosis
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

MEDICATIONS:   Vioxx 25 mg every other day for back pain,
Combivent, and nitro paste one inch every four hours as
needed.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Pulse 94, blood pressure 118/60,
oxygen saturation 95% on room air.  General:  A pleasant man,
in no acute distress. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation,
extraocular movements intact.  Neck:  Negative jugular venous
distention.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Pulmonary:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No peripheral edema.
Vascular:  +2 dorsalis pedis.

LABORATORY DATA:   Hematocrit 31, white blood cell count
12.9, platelets 412.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.7, BUN 20,
creatinine 1.7.  CK 24, 24, 14.  Troponin negative.
Electrocardiogram on [**9-9**] showed ventricular pacing.
Catheter on [**9-11**] showed severe three vessel disease.
Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection
fraction.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed mild esophagitis
and duodenitis, negative ulcers.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to Cardiothoracic
Surgery, and was transported to the operating room on [**9-13**].
The patient's operative diagnosis included coronary artery
disease, unstable angina, hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and anemia.  The procedure was a coronary
artery bypass graft x 3 with left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery, and saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal.  The patient tolerated the procedure well,
and was transported to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit in
stable condition.

On [**9-14**], the patient progressed well in the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was extubated and then
transferred to Far 6.

On [**9-15**], the patient continued to do well, with increased
ambulation.

On [**9-16**], the patient was ambulating at a Level III, and a
decision was made to discharge the patient home after the
patient was cleared by Physical Therapy.
Biopsy of the sternal bone marrow showed hypocellularity but
no malignancy.
On postoperative day four, the patient continued to do well.
The bone marrow biopsy which was taken in the operating room
from the sternum showed normal bone marrow as a preliminary
result.

As long as the patient continues to progress well, and is
cleared by Physical Therapy, the patient will be discharged
home with VNA on [**2176-9-18**].

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.9, pulse 92,
