Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9454**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain and fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97527**] is an 85 year old male with renal cell carcinoma,
end stage renal disease on HD, atrial fibrillation not on
coumadin [**12-27**] fall risk, mild dementia who presented from home
with abdominal pain and fatigue.  The abdominal pain was diffuse
and associated with abdominal distention.  It was not associated
with fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, hematochezia or melena.
He does not make urine at baseline.  In the emergency room he
had a CTA which showed no pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology
but did show a large right pleural effusion and large ascites
(baseline).  His blood pressure at baseline is 90/60 but he
dropped transiently to the 70s and he was given 3.8 L IVF. He
had a diagnostic paracentesis which was negative for SBP.  His
lactate was mildly elevated at 2.8.  On transfer to the ICU his
vitals were T: 99.8 BP:99/75 HR: 90 O2: 96% on 2L.  In the ICU
he did not receive additional IVF.  He was monitored overnight
and was noted to be stable but with a persistent oxygen
requirement as high as 5L.  He received dialysis according to
his normal schedule and was transferred to the floor for further
management.

Currently, patient reported coming to hospital for nodule on his
left rib. He reported falling 2 weeks ago and having that lesion
on his rib after that. He reports tripping on a step but not
hitting his head. According to his wife, he has a poor
ambulatory baseline and uses a walker. He denied other
complaints. He seemed quite somnolent but was arousable to have
an appropriate conversation although he was not completely sure
of his medical history. He did not endorse cough but
occasionally had a wet cough but was not bringing up any sputum.


Review of systems: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache,
vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough,
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,

Microbiology:
Blood cultures x 2 [**2180-8-17**] - no growth to date
Clostridium Difficle - negative on [**2180-8-22**] and [**2180-8-23**]

EKG: Afib rate 108 now in 90s. LAD and TWF in inf and lateral
leads which is old.

CXR [**2180-8-17**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in size of a right-sided pleural
effusion which is large. Haziness of the right sided pulmonary
vasculature suggests
asymmetric pulmonary edema. Probable small left pleural
effusion.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Unchanged large right-sided pleural effusion. Findings
suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema involving the right
lung.
3. Unchanged large amount of ascites. No acute intra-abdominal
or
intra-pelvic pathology.
4. Unchanged enhancing left renal mass which is most likely a
renal cell
carcinoma.

Echocardiogram [**2180-8-17**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-50
%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures
of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in
the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97527**] is an 85 year old male with renal cell carcinoma,
end stage renal disease on HD, atrial fibrillation not on
coumadin [**12-27**] fall risk, mild dementia who presented from home
with abdominal pain and fatigue.

Abdominal Pain:  Unclear etiology.  Pain was diffuse and not
associated with other symptoms with the exception of worsening
abdominal distention and ascites.  Paracentesis was neg
