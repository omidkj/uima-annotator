History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 year old female with a history of depression who
was found to be obtunded with evidence of seizure activity on
[**2141-1-29**].  The patient had been feeling poorly for the past few
weeks with gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea and vomiting
prior to this episode.  She reports that she took increased
doses of her typical medications in an attempt to make herself
feel better.  She takes trazodone 100 mg, hydroxyzine 50 mg,
clonidine 0.1 mg, citalopram 60 mg and simvastatin.  She also
may have taken some of her husband's pain medications.  She
denies that she took extra medications in an attempt to harm
herself.  She noted to her husband that she felt lightheaded
while in bed watching television and then appeared to have a
seizure and lost consciousness.  EMS was called and she was
brought to the hospital.

She was initially taken to [**Hospital6 **] where she wsa
noted to have a wide complex tachycardia to the 170s thought to
be ventricular tachycardia.  She received ativan for her
potential seizure activity and was intubated for airway
protection.  She was shocked four times for her wide complex
tachycardia.  She was hypotensive to the 60s systolic and
received IV fluids and was started on levophed.  She was started
on a bicarbonate drip.  She also received 2 mg magnesium,
activated charcoal, lidocaine 100 mg, diprovan 20 mcg bolus,
ativan 4 mg IV, fentanyl 250 mg IV, pancuronium 8 mg IV and was
started on an amiodarone drip.  She had a negative CT head.  She
was transferred to this hospital for further management.

On arrival to this hospital her initial vitals were HR: 113 BP:
124/95 RR: 14 O2: 100% on ventilator.  EKG showed sinus
tachycardia.  Toxicology was consulted who recommended serial
EKGs every 30 minutes.  She had a left IJ placed for access.
She was started on vancomycin and zosyn for possible sepsis
given hypotension and received an additional 2 L IVF.  She had a
CXR without focal infiltrate.  She was admitted to the MICU.

While in the MICU she was noted to have widening of her QRS with
wide complex tachycardia which was responsive to bicarbonate and
she required bicarbonate drip.  She received additional
activated charcoal.  Her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin
and meropenem for ventilator associated pneumonia given
penicillin allergy and concern that fluoroquinolones would widen
QT interval.  Given persistent wide complex tachycardia there
was concern for pharmacobezoar and she had an upper endoscopy
which was within normal limits.  She was extubated on [**2141-2-1**]
without difficulty.  Immediately prior to transfer she was noted
to have a black tarry stool which was guaiac positive.
Subsequent stools have been dark but guaiac negative.

On exam she denies pain.  She denies taking medications to try
to harm herself.  No fevers, chills, chest pain, difficulty
breathing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling.  All
other review of systems negative in detail.

Imaging:
CXR [**2141-1-29**]: The endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately
2.8 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube tip terminates within
the stomach, however, the side port is superior to the
gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced. The cardiac
silhouette is normal in size.  Patchy airspace opacities in both
lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. The
pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. There is no large
pleural
effusion or sizable pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascularity is
within normal
limits.

[**2141-2-2**]: Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, no
acute ST segment changes


Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old female with a history of depression and prior
suicide attempts who presented with altered mental status and
hypotension felt to be secondary to medication overdose now
transferred to the MICU in stable condition.

Altered Mental Status/Seizures/Hypotension:  Likely related to
medication overdose. Likely medications taken include clonidine,
citalopram, hydroxizine, trazodone and vicodin.  Tylenol and
salicylate levels were negative.  She received activated
charcoal on two occasions.  MICU course was complicated by wide
complex tachycardia which was
