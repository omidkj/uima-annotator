[**2200-10-17**] ultrasound - IMPRESSIONS: As before, there is echogenic
material seen at the neck of the gallbladder which does not move
on left lateral decubitus positioning.  Density, including tiny
punctate calcific density, was seen in this region also on prior
CT. This probably represents a sludge ball, with at least a tiny
stone. However, given persistence and unchanged appearance and
location of findings over multiple studies, MRCP is recommend at
this time to exclude enhancing mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to hospital, ultrasound and labs obtained.
Because of the patient's extensive history including cardiac
disease it was decided that the best course of treatment would
be to place a PTC to drain area. This was accomplished on
[**2200-10-18**]. Patient was given antibiotics and fluid, serial
abdominal exams were performed using interpreter. Patient's pain
gradually resolved and he is now on his diabetic/cardiac diet.

We will discharge him to home with VNA services to monitor his
PTC drain. Drain teaching has been done via interpreter. He will
also receive physical therapy to strengthen to prehospital
status. He will continue antibiotics for a total course of 10
days. Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has been arranged for
[**2200-10-31**], we will check his CBC at this time.

All discharge instructions have been given to him via spanish
interpreter.
