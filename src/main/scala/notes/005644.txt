History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 yo F s/p THR [**2172-5-5**], COPD, HTN who
presented with nausea and lightheadedness in the setting of
blood-loss anemia.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] uncomplicated scheduled THR at NEBH, with an
EBL of 300cc. However, whereas her HCT was 40 pre-operatively,
she had progressive decline in HCT over her hospitalization, and
was discharged to rehabilitation with an HCT of 28 [**5-8**]. She was
started on coumadin for post-op DVT/PE prophylaxis. She did not
apparently receive any transfusion while hospitalized. Bloodwork
the morning of admission demonstrated a HCT of 20, and she was
referred to the ED for further workup.

In ED, patient noted to be OB negative and probability of
post-surgical bleeding from hip was raised. She [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] a CT
pelvis which showed right adductor muscle hematoma. She was
transfused 4 uniutes over a 3 day period with an appropriate
rise in hematocrit from 19 to 30. NG lavage was attempted x 2
without success due to patient discomfort. On hospital day #2,
the patient had a large OB + stool but non-melanotic. Vitamin K
was given with INR decreasing from 2.0 to 1.0.  Patient without
abdominal complaints. On [**5-14**] patient had another large melanotic
bowel movement with hematocrit drop 30 to 24 therefore patient
transferred to unit for urgent EGD. EGD showed a large duodenal
bulb ulcer which was injected with epinephrine. The patient was
started on Protonix [**Hospital1 **].  Her hematocrit remained stable and on
[**5-15**] the patient is stable for call out to floor.

Of note, hospital course also c/b afib/flutter with RVR,
difficulty swallowing pills, CT chest with RUL lesion suspicious
for cancer

11. ECHO [**3-9**] EF 55%, 1+TR/MR/AR. Mild Pulm HTN.

polyps

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 81 yo F with COPD, s/p total hip replacement at the [**Hospital1 15204**] hopsital on [**5-5**] admitted with blood-loss
anemia, initially presumed to be from operative site and
hematoma in adductor muscle, but after melanotic stool found to
have large duodenal bulb ulcer. Her hospital course was
complicated by  supraventricular tachycardia requiring
initiation of diltiazem and a chest CT scan with suspicious Righ
apical lung lesion, and leukocytosis.

1) Hematocrit drop:  This was felt to be multifactorial from
both adductor muscle hematoma and bleeding duodenal bulb ulcer.
GI was consulted during the hospital stay and found the duodenal
bulb ulcer as above. She was transfused a total of 4 units PRBCs
(last transfusion on [**5-12**]).  Hemtocrit remained stable after
epinephrine injection of ulcer.  GI recommended continuing her
Protonix [**Hospital1 **] x 2 months and then decreasing to daily. Her
gastrin level was 104. Her coumadin was held given the bleeding
and she will be started on lovenox SC 40 daily until procedure.


2) SVT - exact rhythm unclear. Rate was well-controlled with
Diltiazem. She was monitored on telemetry which showed only
premature atrial beats. Her heart rate was well-controlled in
80s on diltiazem. The day of discharge her HR increased to 100s
after being NPO for the bronchoscopy.  She was given IVF with
improvement in her heart rate.

3) Lung mass:  CT scan revealed worsening RUL scarring with
spiculations suspicious for malignancy. Given her extensive
smoking history and recent weight loss, there was significant
concern for malignancy.  The patient was made aware of concerns
and need to biopsy.  the case was reviewed with radiology who
felt the patient was too high risk for CT guided biopsy.
Pulmonary was consulted and recommended bronchoscopy with BAL
for cytology. After much discussion, the patient decided against
bronchoscopy in favor of electromagentic field directed
transbronchial  biopsy by interventional pulmonary to be
scheduled within a week of discharge.  This was discussed by
pulmonary at length with patient and daughters.

4)Leukocytosis: Her WBC improved during the hospital course and
remained stable in 12's prior to discharge. Her urinalysis was
negative, but the urine culture grew >100,000 Ecoli. She was
started on Ciprofloxacin for a 10 day course on [**2172-5-13**].  She had
a Foley catheter in place that was removed on [**5-19**].  She should
have a repeat urine culture on completion of therapy to document
clearance.

5) s/p THR: Given the need for further lung biopsies for
diagnsotic purposes of right apical lesion, the patient was not
discharged on lovenox SC or coumadin.  Per pulmonary
recommendations, coumadin was not restarted. However, after
hearing patient's concerns about DVT, she was started on lovenox
40mg SQ daily which will be held 1 day prior to biopsy. She
should begin ambulating as much as possible to prevent
development of DVT. While in bed, she was continued on
pneumoboots and this should be continued at rehab as well.

6) COPD: Her COPD remained stable throughout the hospital
course. She was continued on advair and tiotropium.

7) Glaucoma: No active issues. She remained on diazolamide
throughout the hospital stay.

8) Thrush, resolved: Likely [**1-8**] inhaled steroids. She was
initially treated with nystatin swish and swallow. We
recommended rinsing her mouth after advair usage.

9) Sacral Decub: She had an early sacral decubitus.  This was
covered with duoderm and her family applied bag balm (niece
hospice RN). This should be monitored on discharge.

11) Code - reversed for EGD and 48 hours post procedure.
