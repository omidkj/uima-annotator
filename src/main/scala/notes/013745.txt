.
[**3-4**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema.
.
[**3-2**] C Cath
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Acute posterior myocardial infarction.
2. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
3. Widely patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-RCA, occluded SVG-OM.
4. Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
5. IABP placement due to low cardiac output.
6. Successful PTCA of the left main and ostial Cx.
.
[**3-3**] ECHO
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic function
consistent with CAD. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-7-18**],
there is new regional dysfunction in the anterolateral wall.
Estimated pulmonary artery pressures are slightly higher. Mitral
regurgitation is not well seen on the current study.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 83 y/o M with h/o HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD s/p CABG [**2157**]
who presents with chest pain and positive enzymes.  Hospital
Course complication by:
.
CARDIAC
# CAD/ chest pain: patient with h/o of CAD. + st changes on EKG,
positive cardiac enzymes --> NSTMI s/p cardiac cath with balloon
angioplasty to LM + LCX. No stents placed. hemodynamics
compatible with poor CI + elevated wedge.  CK peaked at 1376.
- received heparin/Integrilin (18h)
- Continued aspirin/ Plavix
- Weaned off Dobutamine and then IABP
- re-started ACEI/B-blocker once BP tolerated
- no additional chest pain during his hospital course
.
Pump: EF 30% Patient with elevated pressures in the cath lab. He
was in pulmonary edema on admission but was euvolemic on
discharge.
- he was re-started on his outpt diuretic on discharge
.
Rhythm: NSR
.
# HTN: Blood pressure medicines initially held but lisinopril
and metoprolol were re-started by discharge
.
# Hyperlipidemia: continued high dose statin.
.
# Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency: Most likely pre-renal in
the setting of low cardiac index. Cr 2.5 on admission but back
to baseline of 1.6 on discharge.  On lisinopril.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Hyperkalemic on admission likely [**1-24**] acute renal
failure.
No EKG changes suggested of hyperkalemia. Received calcium
gluconate.  Resolved by discharge.
.
# DM/Hyperglycemia: Elevated on admission. Apparently he was
using his insulin as prescribed. Anion gap acidosis on admission
which may also represent his worsening renal failure with
accumulation of organic anions.  Was not in DKA.  Insulin gtt
was started but d/c'd once taking pos.  Was re-started on home
insulin doses on discharge.
.
# Elevated LFT's: currently on statins as outpatient. Prior
records on OMR showed normal LFT's. No history of alcohol abuse.
- ? [**1-24**] statin use, may need to decrease dose as outpatient
.
# FEN:
- Cardiac/renal diet
.
# ??Depression: will continue Celexa as per outpatient regimen.
