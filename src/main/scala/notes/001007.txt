Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the general surgery service on
[**2194-11-17**] for treatment of a pneumonia. He was intubated on HD1
and started on broad spectrum antibiotics, which he tolerated
well.

Neuro: The patient received tylenol PO with good effect and
adequate pain control.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. During HD 1 he was placed
brifly on an esmolol drip and after a brief episode of
bradycardia he converted to sinus rhythm. On HD 3 he declined
further care and was made CMO, his atrial fibrillation returned
and at the time of discharge his heart rate was 120-150.

Pulmonary: The patient was intubated on HD 1 but the
ventillatoor was weaned and he remained on 4LNC throughout the
remainder of his hospital stay.

GI/GU: Fluids were kept to a minimum throughout this hospital
stay because of his history of CHF. On HD 3 he was given a 10mg
dose of lasix, which caused the patient to diurese nicely. he
took minimal PO through this hospital stay. Foley was kept in
place and the patient will be discharged to home with it for
comfort.

ID: The patient was started on IV vanc, cipro, cefapime, and
flagyl upon admission. this was continued through HD 3, when the
patient refused any further care. After HD 3 th epatient's
temperature was watched closely and treated with tylenol PRN to
provide comfort.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin until HD
3.

At the time of discharge on HD 4, the patient was afebrile abd
his pain was well controlled.

Given his decision to become CMO and to expire at his home among
his family, a palliative care consult was obtained to maximize

patient.
