History of Present Illness:
55 year old female with recent admission for osteomyelitis and
epidural abscess of L3,L4 presenting with change in mental
status, hypotension, and fever. She was discharged to Rehab 6
days prior to this admission. On her last admission she
underwent IR drainage of abscess on [**2112-2-12**], went to OR for
debridement and fixation on [**2-16**]. She was treated with Linezolid
for her MRSA epidural abscess and VRE bacteremia with an end
date to be determined by ID in clinic.
.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] husband states that she has had increased fatigue and
malaise over the last few weeks.  No fevers until yesterday.
Appeared "stoned" at rehab - thought to be due to overmedication
(narcotics for back pain).  She had increased back pain not as
responsive as previous to narcotics.
.
On admission to OSH, pt was febrile to 103.5F, tachycardic to
130, RR 30, with BP down to 77/58, satting 88-90% on RA, 94% on
100% NRB. She experienced increasing respiratory distress and
was intubated in the ED. Subsequent ABG: 7.27/49/56/22 on AC
14/550/5/100%. She was placed on dopamine for hypotension, and
placed on empiric levofloxacin, vancomycin, gentamicin, and
linezolid. D-dimer was positive, but rising creatinine (2.7)
prevented CTA from being done, and pt was thought to be too
unstable for V/Q scan. Was placed empirically on heparin gtt.
Dopamine was d/c'ed as pt tachycardic, changed to neosynephrine.
 Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.

2) VRE bacteremia diagnosed [**1-14**]
3) Small cell lung carcinoma on the right- Pt was diagnosed in
[**2109**]. s/p chemotherapy and radiation. No metastasis found.
Oncologist is Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 21628**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]
4) CAD- NSTEMI in [**2110**], stress test in [**2110**] LVEF of 38% and a
moderate sized fixed inferior lateral defect. Echo [**2112-2-23**] with
EF >55%, nl wall motion
3. Hypertension
4. GERD
5. S/P excision of lipoma
6. S/P eye surgery
7. S/P knee surgery
8. S/P tonsillectomy
9. COPD
10. Anxiety
11. MRSA bacteremia during her chemotherapy.

.
Imaging: ECHO [**2112-2-23**] - EF > 55%; no evidence of vegetations
.
Initial CXR: 1.  Asymmetric alveolar opacities, which may
represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, pneumonia or ARDS.
2.  Somewhat low lying position of endotracheal tube, 1.5 cm
above the carina.

T- and L-Spine MRI:
Severely limited study secondary to motion artifacts in
particular the axial post-gadolinium images. Signal changes
indicating discitis and osteomyelitis are again seen at L3-4
level. New signal changes are seen at the superior endplate of
L5 and L4-L5 disc which could be secondary to discitis at this
level. No intraspinal abscess is seen. Further followup is
suggested.

[**2112-3-3**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF 60-70%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2112-2-23**], no major change is
evident. The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does
not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.

[**2112-3-7**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the entire septum and anterior wall and mild
dyskinesis of the distal inferior and apex. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypetension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2112-3-3**], there has been a marked regional deterioration in left
ventricular systolic function c/w
interim ischemia (proximal LAD lesion).

[**2112-3-9**] TTE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20
percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the entire
interventricular septum and anterior free wall, severe
hypokinesis of the lateral wall, and extensive apical akinesis.
No definite masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. There is focal hypokinesis of the apical
free wall of the right ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-3-7**], no major change is evident.
