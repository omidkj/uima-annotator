Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Right weakness and aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
77 RHM with PMH of HTN, lipids, CAD was transfered from OSH for
neuro eval. Next, Neurology was called.

He underwent right carotid endarterectomy on [**2119-12-8**] and per
notes, it was uneventful. This was done as a elective procedure
after he had episodes of amaurosis fugax in right eye few days
ago which on evaluation shows BL significant (more than 80
percent) carotid stenosis.

He was noted to be in usual health till last night. This am
after
waking up he noted weakness on right hand, arm followed quickly
by right LE and difficulty speaking. He was taken to OSH. At
OSH,
he was in sinus rhythm with a blood pressure of 195/81, and 100%
on nasal cannula. He was noted to have "Moderate difficulty with
speech, and moderate right sided weakness." NIHSS score was 12.
CT head shows left thalamic bleed about 2.5 cm. Labs shows : CBC
: 5.3-13.7/41-222, Chem 7 showed : Na 143, K
3.9, Cl 106, Co2 35, BUN 19, cr 1, glucose 109.  LFTs were
normal. EKG did not show anything acute. He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for neuro eval.

Mental status: Awake, alert. Can say soem words and has says
some phrases. Doesnot want to try to speak often. Can say yes/no
approproately. Can follow commands but soem difficulty wioth
coplexd commands. Very cantancerous. Likely fully oriented - at
least A+Ox2. Some naming difficulties especially wioth body
parts but seems to be improving.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm
bilaterally. Visual fields- grossly intact. ? attends more to
left.
Fundus per admission exam - no papilledema.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Right UMN facial weakness and considerable dysarthria.  Palate
elevation symmetrical.  Tongue
midline, movements intact

Motor: Right significant hemiparesis. Can move right fingers [**3-18**]
and slight contraction [**2-15**] elbow flexion/ext on right. Slight
contraction in right hip flexion [**2-15**] and plantar flexion [**2-15**].
Good spontaneous movement and likely normal power on left.

Sensation: Intact to touch and pain on left with decreased
sensation on right per patient.

Reflexes: Presnet in UE and LE but absent ion bilateral ankles.
Toes were flexor on left and equivocal on right.

Coordination: difficult to assess due to compliance on left and
hemiparesis on right

Gait/Romberg: Not assessed

=================================

Exam on discharge:

Essentially unchanged. Very poor patient compliance with refusal
to participate in daily exam. Continues to have significant
aphasia with receptive and productive deficits.

Right upper extremity: finger flexion [**2-15**], biceps and triceps
[**2-15**]

Radiology:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2119-12-13**] 1:14 PM
FINDINGS: A 2.2 x 1.9 cm left thalamic hematoma appears stable
when compared to prior CT from outside hospital imaged
approximately four hours ago. There is an increased amount of
layering hemorrhage in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left
lateral ventricle. A small amount of intraventricular blood is
noted in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle, unchanged. There is surrounding edema, appears stable
from prior CT. Also noted is a hypodense area in the left
frontal lobe that appears unchanged and likely represents
encephalomalacia from a prior infarct. There is no shift of
midline structures. There is no new area of hemorrhage
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable left thalamic hemorrhage with slight increase in
intraventricular
hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle.
2. No new areas of hemorrhage identified.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-12-13**] 12:52 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

MR-HEAD:
FINDINGS: Limited MRI study secondary to patient motion. Only
sagittal T1,
axial T1, and axial FLAIR sequences were obtained, which were
also markedly degraded by patient motion. Within these
limitations, left thalamic hematoma is redemonstrated, with
surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality. There is no hydrocephalus
or midline shift. Size of the hematoma appears similar to that
seen on the previous CT.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal MRI study secondary to patient motion.
Left thalamic hematoma is redemonstrated. A repeat MRI study may
be obtained after adequately sedating the patient.

CT_HEAD
Preliminary Report
1. Stable left basal ganglia hemorrhage with partial resorption
of
intraventricular blood in the lateral ventricles.
2. No new areas of hemorrhage.
