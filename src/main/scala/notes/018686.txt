Admission Date:  [**2103-6-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2103-6-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2055-11-14**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
female, with a history of COPD and asthma, schizoaffective
disorder, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism,
ETOH and benzodiazepine abuse, who was admitted [**6-9**],
status post fall prior, with some associated resulting leg
weakness, found to have a T8 radiculopathy and mild
myelopathy secondary to retropulsion and cord compression.
CT scan of the spine showed T8 retropulsion with possible
cord compression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a T8 vertebrectomy
and T7-9 stabilization that was done [**2103-6-11**] by
neurosurgery, with no complications.  The patient was
continued on a Solu-Medrol drip postoperatively, and changed
to hydrocortisone on [**6-12**].

The patient was sent to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively and was extubated on [**6-13**].  On [**6-13**], she
was also noted to have bright red blood per rectum with no
associated nausea, vomiting, or any abdominal pain,
tachycardic to 120s, with hypotension, blood pressures
160-100.  The patient received, at that time, 4 units of
packed red blood cells, as well as 4 units of FFP.
Hematocrit noted to drop from 34-24 after the bleed, but then
increased back to 34 with transfusion during that time.

The patient had a GI consult, with a colonoscopy that was
recommended, but deferred given the patient's recent
stabilization of bleeding and recent postoperative
neurosurgery.

The patient progressed reasonably well until [**6-15**], when the
patient was transferred to a regular medical floor, 98% on
nasal cannula.  On [**6-17**], in the morning the patient had an
increasing episode of respiratory distress with O2
saturations noted to be 90-92% on 3 liters nasal cannula, in
spite of receiving albuterol and aggressive chest physical
therapy.  Noted was thick green sputum that was suctioned.
The patient was started on PO Levaquin.

A CTA that was done was negative for pulmonary embolism.  A
chest x-ray, as well as the CTA, noted a left lower lobe
consolidation consistent with pneumonia, as well as bilateral
ground glass opacities.  The patient was still coughing up
green sputum with saturations 88-92% on [**3-27**] liters nasal
cannula.  On [**6-19**], the patient received some lasix 20 mg IV
for respiratory distress with no change in respiratory
status.

On [**6-20**], a pulmonary consult was recommended.  The consult
was done.  Recommendations included a change for broader
antibiotic coverage to include gram-positive rods, as well as
gram-negative rods, and anaerobes.  Therefore, Zosyn and
vancomycin IV were started, and Levaquin was DC'd during that
time.  Later that afternoon, the patient had another episode
of respiratory distress with tachypnea and O2 saturations in
the 80s.  Therefore, it was decided that the patient would be
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit at that time.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vitals - 98.8, blood pressure 169/90,
respirations between 22-30, pulse 100-112, satting 92% on O2
nonrebreather.  The patient is an obese female in moderate
respiratory distress, speaks [**4-28**] words before pause.  Pupils
are equal and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck - no
JVD.  Respiratory - is wheezing bilaterally with coarse
breath sounds, symmetrical.  Heart - regular rate and rhythm,
S1, S2 noted, II/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is
nontender and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Neurological
exam - alert and oriented, moving all extremities.

LABORATORIES:  White count 24.2, hematocrit 32.4, platelets
169, sodium 140, potassium 4.0, chloride 99, bicarbonate 27,
BUN 23, creatinine 0.7, glucose 101, calcium 9.1, PT 24.9,
PTT 28.8, INR 4.1.  ABG - pH 7.45, PCO2 47, PO2 57,
bicarbonate 34.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral consolidation,
done on the [**6-20**].  The [**6-16**] CT angiogram of the chest
showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, with left lower
lobe consolidation, and bilateral ground glass opacities.  A
[**6-18**] stool cultures were negative for Clostridium difficile.
A [**6-17**] sputum was negative.

For respiratory distress, the patient received albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers as needed.  Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q 8
h was started, as well as aggressive chest PT, suctioning,
and elevation of head of bed with aspiration precautions.
Etiology of respiratory distress likely due to pneumonia,
possible hospital acquired.  Therefore, the patient was
started on Zosyn and vancomycin.  Sputum cultures would be
checked serially.  Because of the recent lower GI bleed,
serial hematocrits were checked.  Protonix was given.  If
decreasing hematocrits noted, then a bleeding scan would be
needed.  The patient was started NPO and given intravenous
fluids of D5 [**1-25**] normal saline started.  Hypotension was
treated with patient's hydralazine 10 mg q 6 h as needed.

Over the course of the hospital stay, results of sputum
cultures showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters,
with noted moderate oropharyngeal flora and presence of
yeast.  Urine cultures done serially all showed negative
results.  Hematocrits during the rest of the hospital stay to
time of discharge were stable with no hematocrit ever going
below a target value of 30 despite fear of hematocrit
measurements.

PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient was continued on all
prehospital psychiatric medications.  A psychiatric consult
was done on [**6-24**] with recommendations that the patient stay
on psychiatric medications, and ativan be administered as a
standing dose instead of prn.

During the first day in the ICU, the patient had continuing
respiratory distress with hyperventilation, despite being on
pressure support with biphasic positive airway pressure.
Therefore, the decision was made to intubate the patient on
[**6-21**].  The patient was also started on tube feeds for a
question of aspiration on PO.  Noted was continuous
suctioning of thick secretions, but changing in consistency
to white from a previous color of yellowish-green.  The
patient was ventilated on assisted control with a tidal
volume of 550, rate of 16, PEEP of 5, and a FIO2 of 0.4 on
initial settings which she tolerated well per serial ABGs.
On [**6-22**], the patient was started on a trial of pressure
support ventilation from assisted control which she tolerated
well.  Therefore, later on on that day on [**6-22**], the patient
was extubated successfully and started on albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers standing dose q 3 h, tube feeds were
held, and the patient was kept NPO due to aspiration
precautions.

Left lower extremity ultrasounds were negative for DVT.
Also, the patient's vancomycin on [**6-23**] was DC'd, since
sputum culture showed no evidence of Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Serial urinalysis done showed no
evidence UTI throughout the rest of the hospital stay.

On [**2103-6-24**], psychiatry was consulted given patient's
multiple episodes of respiratory distress, status post
extubation.  They noted that the patient's anxiety was a
large component of her respiratory distress.  Psychiatry's
recommendations were that the patient would continue with all
of her preadmission medications, and that ativan should be
considered as a standing dose of 0.5 mg tid.  Recommendation
was also to check a TSH for possible hyperthyroidism as a
source of her anxiety.  The patient's hydralazine was
discontinued, and diltiazem was started at 30 mg po qid,
given patient's unresponsiveness to hydralazine and recent
clonidine trial of 0.1 mg po.  It was thought that
hydralazine was causing a reflex tachycardia which would be
contributing to the patient's anxiety component.  The patient
was also switched to an oral steroid dose of prednisone 60 mg
po qd during that same time.

Over the rest of the hospital course, the patient's
respiratory status improved remarkably.  The patient's high
blood pressure was improved slightly.  The patient's
respirations rate decreased from high-30s, to low-40s, to the
