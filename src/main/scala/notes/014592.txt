History of Present Illness:
51 year old male who is followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for his
hypertension. During his most recent cardiology follow-up visit
[**2201-2-10**] he was started on spironolactone 25 mg due to evidence
of LVH by EKG, presence of proteinuria and his family history.
Approximately one week ago he experienced an episode of chest
pain while walking up an incline. He was referred for an ETT
[**2201-3-4**] which revealed marked ischemic EKG changes with
downsloping ST segment depression as well as ST segment
elevation. He was referred for coronary angiography and was
found to have coronary artery disesase and is now being referred
to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2201-3-10**] 8:59 AM
 FINDINGS: There has been increased aeration of the right lung
with
Preliminary Reportcorresponding reduction in right-sided
atelectasis. There is decreased right basilar pleural effusion.
Left lung appears slightly more inflated with a small increase
in left pleural effusion. There are no areas of focal
consolidation concerning for infection. There is no
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with no
evidence of pulmonary edema or failure. Right-sided IJ catheter
is seen well positioned terminating within the mid SVC. Sternal
wires are seen in vertical alignment along the midline with no
obvious hardware complications.
IMPRESSION:
 No evidence of cardiac failure.
 Improved lung aeration bilaterally. Decreased right-sided
pleural  effusion, left-sided pleural effusion.

regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral

There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
The patient is on no inotropes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 7771**] was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization
after a positive ETT. The catheterization revealed three vessel
coronary artery disease with normal left ventricular function.
He was then referred to cardiac surgery and brought to the
operating room for emergent coronary bypass grafting. See
operative report for details in summary he had:
1. Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x 5 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous
vein grafts to diagonal 1 and diagonal 2, and posterior
descending arteries and a left radial artery to ramus.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.
3. Left radial artery harvesting.
His bypass time was 113 minutes with a crossclamp time of 88
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and post operatively
was transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery
ICU. He remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op
period, woke neurologically [**Hospital1 5235**] and was extubated. He
remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of the
operative day and on POD1 was transferred to the stepdown floor
for continued post-op recovery and care. At the time of transfer
the patients chest tubes remained in place because of an air
leak. Over the next 24 hours the patient had his chest tubes
remov
