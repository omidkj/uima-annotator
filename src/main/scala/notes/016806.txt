[**7-29**] CXR: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion that is worse

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia/ Resp. failure: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a h/o right heart
failure and is on home O2. She presented with 7 days of
shortness of breath, sputum production and pulmonary edema, and
was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate. she has recently
been admitted for CHF exacerbations has had multiple admissions
for CHF exacerbation including one three weeks prior to this
admission. Pt. has a 4l o2 requirement at baseline with activity
and 3L at rest. In the ED the patients SOB did not improve. An
ABG was done (7.29/109/91 bicarp 41) and she was subsequently
placed on bipap.  However she became increasingly somnelent
despite these measure, she was intubated and transfered to the
MICU. In the MICU patient was continued on levofloxacin for
presumed PNA.  She was weaned off the vent and extubated on [**7-31**].
  She was diuresed with lasix and ruled out for MI with 2 sets
negative CEs. She developed a metabolic acidosis likely [**1-30**] to
diuresis and was given acetazolamide to decrease bicarb so CO2
would not increase in response.

2. LLL PNA: After extubation the patient was continued on
Levofloxacin and inhalers.
.
3. Pulm HTN: Continued on Sildenafil.
.
4. CHF exacerbation: A CXR should worsening pulmonary vascular
congestion.  She ws diuresed with lasix as needed.

MI.  Pt. was monitored on telemetry
