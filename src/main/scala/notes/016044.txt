Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Lung mass.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lung biopsy on [**2193-2-28**].
Vertebroplasty


History of Present Illness:
88 year old male with a history of prostate cancer, CVA, DM2,
CEA and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred to the medicine service for further
evaluation of a lung mass. The patient was in his usual state of
health until one month prior to admission when he developed
upper extremity weakness, right more than left as well as
bilateral shoulder pain and a cough. He was admitted to an OSH
and was found to have a LLL infiltrate and was treated for
pneumonia and COPD flare.  He also had a spine MRI which
demonstrated a T1 compression fracture.  The patient was
transitioned to rehabilitation.  At the rehab facility he
continued to have upper extremity weakness and bilateral
shoulder pain refractory to conservative measures.  MRI of his
brain showing no significant change from his post-stroke MRI per
report.  His R hand weakness progressed and he was sent from
rehab back to the OSH where he again had a MRI of his C-spine
which showed interval progression of the compression fracture
with retropulsion of the posterior fragment into the upper
thoracic cord.  Additionally, a soft tissue mass anterior to the
vertebral body brought up the possibility of metastatic disease.
 His PSA remained flat at this time and a CT chest showed 2 LLL
masses along with renal and thyroid cysts.  He was started on
steroids and  sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
Incidentally, he was restarted on CTX/gentamycin at the OSH per
family report because he developed fevers but they denied any
other infectious symptoms at this time including SOB, cough,
dysuria, or abdominal pain.  He did have mild diarrhea.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], his films were reviewed by neurosurgery and no cord
compression was noted.  His thoracic vertebral fracture was
thought to be stable and he was fitted for a brace.  IP was
consulted to perform a percutaneous biopsy of the mass and CT of
the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed.  A bone scan and
CT head were ordered along with a MRI of C5-T4.  The patient was
transfered to medicine for further work-up of his lung mass once
acute neurosurgical issues were excluded.
.
On interview today, the patient feels generally well.  He denies
any CP, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or headache.  He
does have some LE paresthesias and notes weakness in his R hand
that is worse than baseline.  His family notes chronically loose
bowels but states this has been worse of late and feels that his
cognition has slipped over the past month.

Pertinent Results:
At the time of callout from the MICU ([**2193-3-2**]):
.
Labs: Remarkable for WBC 18.3 trending downward, Hct 27.9
baseline 32, INR 1.3.
.
MR thoracic and cervical spine without contrast ([**2193-2-25**]): 1.
Again seen is compression deformity involving the T1 vertebral
body. There
is no evidence of cord signal abnormality. Degenerative changes
within the cervical spine result in areas of spinal canal
stenosis, as described above. 2. There is left pleural effusion
and ill-defined mass in left lower lobe, which is better
evaluated on prior CT scans.
.
Bone Scan ([**2193-2-26**]): No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
Focal uptake in the lower neck likely correlates with T1
compression fracture on CT scan.
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis ([**2193-2-24**]):
1. Multiple heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue masses within
the posterior left lung likely centering within the pleura
extending into the lateral chest wall and causing mild bony
erosion. A small linear calcification is noted adjacent to the
pleura within the dominant mass suggesting possible
mesothelioma. Additional diagnoses within the differential
include primary lung cancer or metastatic lesion from thyroid or
renal cell carcinoma. The lesion appears to be amenable to
percutaneous biopsy. 2. Heterogeneously enhancing middle
mediastinal left thyroid lesion. This likely represents a simple
goiter but can be further evaluated with ultrasound if
clinically indicated. 3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of
acute cholecystitis. 4. Multiple right renal hypoattenuating
lesions, some of which are clearly cystic and others which are
too small to characterize. 5. Diffuse atherosclerotic
calcifications. 6. T1 compression fracture with multilevel
degenerative changes throughout the spine, including grade 1
anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 and mild posterior disc protrusion
of L3-4 intervertebral disc.
.
Bronchial brushings and washings ([**2193-2-28**]): Negative for
malignant cells.
.
Lymph node biopsy ([**2193-2-28**]): Non-diagnostic, lymph node not
sampled, likely reactive lymphocytes.
.
Echo ([**2193-3-1**]): The left atrium is elongated. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is grossly preserved although views are technically
suboptimal (EF probably >45%). Regional wall motion could not be
fully assessed. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
CXR ([**2193-3-1**]): Large lower lobe consolidation.  This may be due
to aspiration, hemorrhage, or pneumonia.
.
CXR ([**2193-3-2**]): Increased airspace opacity involving both lungs
is new when compared to the previous chest radiograph and CT.
The finding represents mild pulmonary edema. Previously
identified bilateral lower lobe opacities are much less
conspicuous on the current exam. Deviation of the trachea from
the midline to the right attributable to the previously seen
enlarged thyroid.
.
CTA ([**2193-3-1**]): 1.  No pulmonary embolism. 2.  New bilateral
pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right.
3. Consolidation of the majority of the right lower lobe.
