History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23189**] is a 62 y/o gentleman with a history of 3vd felt to
not be amenable to CABG s/p RCA DES [**3-/2169**], history of
hypertension, history of diabetes, history of stroke, presented
to the ED with chest pain x~3 days worse on presentation and ECG
changes consistent with interior STEMI. Per ED notes, his family
called EMS, and while enroute he reportedly collapsed at home,
found awake but short of breath. He reportedly became chest pain
free in the ED.
In the ED, his HR was 112 bpm and SBP was 206. RR 24 Sat 100% on
Bipap. He was noted to be diaphoretic, have bilateral rales, and
be guaiac negative. He was started on nitro gtt and STEMI
protocol, including having received plavix 600mg PO x1, Heparin
bolus, Integrillin bolus 15mg IV x1, and aspirin. His ED course
was notable for vomiting and he was given zofran, but intubated
given vomiting and tenuous respiratory status with 7.5F ETT.
Thick secretions were suctioned after intubation.

In the cath lab, he was found to have stent thrombosis of his
distal RCA. This was managed by evaculation of clot and POBA.
Hemodynamics were: Fick CO4.80 / CI 2.43, Mix [**Last Name (un) **] Sat 74%, PCWPm
28 PA 43/30/36.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Diabetes
History of Stroke (Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 3101**] Note: pontine stroke in
[**1-/2171**] with residual left leg weakness and left arm weakness.)

CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:
[x] Diabetes [x] Dyslipidemia [x] Hypertension
CARDIAC HISTORY:
- CABG: None
- Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**3-/2169**] anatomy as
follows:
Distal RCA: PTCA/stenting of the distal (Cypher DES: 2.5x23 and

[**4-9**] Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
showed
three vessel disease.  The LMCA had no disease.  The LAD had a
very
distal 70% stenosis.  The LCX had a very distal 90% stenosis in
the AV
groove branch.  The RCA had a 100% occlusion with stent
thrombosis in
distal RCA.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right
enddiastolic
filling pressures measured at 22 mmHg.  The PCW pressure was
elevated at
28 mmHg.  There was mild pulmonary hypertension with normal
pulmonary
vascular resistance at 80 dynes/s/cm-5.  The cardiac output was
preserved at 2.4 L/min/m2.  There is moderate sytemic arterial
hypertension measured at 151/103 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. In stent restenosis of distal RCA.
3. Elevated PCWP pressures.
.
[**4-9**] Echo:
Image quality is very limited. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the
interventricular septum and posterior wall, and akinesis of the
inferior wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2171-1-15**], there is now evidence of extensive
intercurrent myocardial infarction (inferior posterior).
.
[**4-9**] portable CXR:IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with severe
pulmonary edema. Small bilateral effusions.
.

[**4-11**] CT head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage,
edema, or mass. MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**]- weighted imaging is more
sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia. Paranasal sinus
disease as described above.
.
[**2173-4-14**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow background with
occasional epochs of diffuse attenutation. These findings are
suggestive of a
widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and
subcortical
structu
