FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH. VIRAL CULTURE
(Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.

CT head [**2167-6-29**]:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Hypoattenuating areas within the right frontal, temporal and
parietal lobes, which likely represent an old infarct

MRI [**2167-6-30**]:  No evidence of acute hemorrhage, mass, or
infarction, Findings consistent with an old right middle
cerebral artery territory infarction, Normal circle of [**Location (un) 431**],
carotid artery, and vertebral artery MRA.

CHEST, AP [**2167-6-30**]: The tip of the endotracheal tube is about 4 cm
above the carina. There is moderate cardiomegaly. Pleural
thickening is seen in the left lower zone. The lungs are clear.
There are no pleural effusions. The pulmonary vasculature is
normal. The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures
appear unremarkable

EEG [**2167-6-30**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to a diffusely slowed
and disorganized
posterior and anterior rhythm suggestive of a moderately severe
diffuse
encephalopathy.

ECG [**2167-6-30**]  Sinus tachycardia, Left axis deviation - anterior
fascicular block, Prior anteroseptal infarct, Modest nonspecific
low amplitude lateral T wave changes

CHEST portable [**2167-7-1**]: IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities in the right
upper and left lower lung zones. The findings may relate to
aspiration and/or pneumonia.

changes
Since previous tracing, no significant change

post effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  62 y/o male p/w change in mental status -- aggitation and
confusion.  Etiology was initially unclear, however, paitient
was not reliably taking his insulin, and was shown to have a
glucose level of 341 on admission.  Encephalopathy was
considered, but unclear of exact origin given CSF findings.  No
acute CVA on this admission found. On this visit Pt initially
expressed desire to end life while he was delirious, but when
re-evaluated after treatment for delirium, however, he expressed
no such wishes.  Pt needs a diabetes mgt plan to better control
his blood glucose and [**Doctor Last Name **] better health.  He will be seen by
[**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.  On discharge he did not express any
desire to end his life.  Mood was improved and psychiatry did
not feel he needed outpatient follow-up.

DELIRIUM/PSYCH:  During this hospital stay the patient was
continued on haldol initially, and other management included:
trying to regulate sleep wake cycles, thus appropriately
treating OS, consultation with psychiatry and 1:1 sitter for
suicide risk initially.  His delirium did improve on this
admission.  Specifically, with better control of his glucose,
his mental status improved with less confusion and agitation.
Haldol was discontinued for full psychiatric eval and patient
was deemed stable, without acute issues by psychiatry.  With
resolution of his delirium, it was evident the patient was not
depressed or suicidal.
He had improved mood on discharge.

DM: The patient is a poorly controlled diabetic.  He was
controlled on 12 U Lantus in pm while here.  He wi
