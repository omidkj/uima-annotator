Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o male who sustained a C [**2-5**] cervical spine
fracture after falling.  No other injuries noted on imaging.  He
was initally admitted to the trauma ICU where he was evaluated
by the trauma and ortho spine team.  An MRI was attempted to
further characterize the spinal injury however, despite sedation
the patient was not cooperative with this.  Upon further
discussion with the ortho spine service, it was decided that the
best management of the c-spine injury would be a cervical spine
collar w/ torso extension x 3 months.  The pt was placed in this
collar and subsequently transfered to the floor on HD 4.  Once
on the floor the pt's mental status started to decline and he
developed a tachycardia.  Geriatrics, Cardiology, and
Neuro-Behavioral consults were obtained.  A urinary tract
infection was noted and levofloxacin was intially started and
broadened to include vancomycin once the culture results
returned.  In addition, a CTA was done to r/o PE given the pts
tachycardia and increasing oxygen requirement.  The CTA was neg.
On HD 7 the pt spiked a fever to 102.6 and antibiotics and IV
fluids were continued.  Later that morning the patient had a
cardiac arrest.

The above portion of the dictation including the HPI, past
medical history, admission medications, and labs was completed
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 915**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] of the trauma surgery service who cared for
the patient for the majority of his hospitalization from
[**Date range (1) 39442**] up until the time of the cardiac arrest.  I am
completing this dictation from reviewing the remaining portion
of the medical record as I did not directly care for this
patient.

On [**7-10**] at noon, a code Blue was called when pt was found to be
bradycardic and unresponsive.  Pt was initially asystolic then
went into PEA arrest.  He was given several rounds of atropine
and epinephrine as well as calcium, bicarb, and IVF.  He was
intubated.  Pt's pulse returned and dopamine was started for BP
support.
Stat echocardiogram done by cardiology showed no tamponade.
Diff dx at that time was either sepsis or PE.  Pt was started
empirically on heparin drip for concern of PE and transferred to
MICU.  At 3:15 pm, family meeting was held with patient's wife
and per discussion with her, pt would not have wanted aggressive
life support and pt was made comfort measures only. He expired
30 minutes later.
