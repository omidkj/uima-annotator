Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing, VT storm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
electrophysiology study and ablation [**2114-12-7**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 year old female with idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy (? viral myocarditis 10 years ago) with LVEF of
20% s/p BiV ICD, and recurrent multifocal ventricular
tachycardia s/p L VATS for sympathectomy and excision of the
left stellate Ganglion on [**2114-11-26**] in setting of recurrent VT
who presents from home with multiple ICD shocks. Since returning
home, she has felt well. She has noted intermittent palpitations
since yesterday.
.
The patient has had a long course of admissions since [**Month (only) 359**]
[**2113**] for recurrent multifocal ventricular tachycardia and ICD
firings. She was found to have multiple inducible VTs arising
from the septum, lateral wall and apex during EP study in
[**Month (only) 359**], with the septal origin of VT precluded ablation. She
was started on mexilitine but continued to have frequent
sustained VT. Anterior septal ablation was attempted, but she
experienced recurrent VT. She was readmitted and had successful
stellate ganglion block and was started on qunidine. About one
week later, she had recurrent palpitations and was re-admitted
for repeat stellate ganglion block twice.  During her most
recent admission, she was taken to the operating room with
Thoracic Surgery on [**2114-11-26**] and had a left-sided video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure with sympathectomy
without issue and was in sinus rhythm afterwards. She was
discharged on metoprolol but not any anti-arrhythmics.  The
patient had been feeling very well until yesterday, when she
began to note some palpitations. She was having dinner with her
family and felt palpitations and experienced one shock, followed
in succession by approximately 3 more shocks. Her husband called
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and he advised admission to the CCU.
.
In the CCU, she has no complaints. Interrogation of her ICD
reveals 20 episodes of VT since [**2114-11-29**], mostly with rate in
110-130s range.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
[**2114-12-6**] Left pectoral AICD device is seen with its leads
terminating into the right atrium, right ventricle and coronary
sinus. Mildly enlarged heart size is stable. There are no lung
opacities of concern. There is no pleural effusion. Mediastinal
and hilar contours are normal. IMPRESSION:
No acute process in the chest.
[**2114-12-8**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
patient has received a pericardial drain. The size of the
cardiac silhouette has minimally increased. There is mild
retrocardiac atelectasis, but no evidence of substantial pleural
effusions. No pulmonary edema. No hilar or mediastinal
abnormalities.
[**2114-12-8**] ECHO:FOCUSED STUDY FOR PERICARDIAL EFFUSION. The left
atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a small pericardial effusion. No right atrial diastolic
collapse is seen. Slight right ventricular invagination during
mid-diastole. No MV/TV respiratory variation.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular invagination during
mid-diastole (best seen on subcostal views) in presence of small
circumferential pericardial effusion. Severely depressed left
ventricular systolic function. Mild right ventricular
hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-10-25**],
the pericardial effusion is new.
[**2114-12-8**] ECHO: FOCUSED STUDY: Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-12-8**],
right ventricular invagination is not seen. There is slightly
more mitral regurgitation.
[**2114-12-9**] ECHO: FOCUSED STUDY: There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). Right ventricular ch
