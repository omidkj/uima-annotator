Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Osteomyelitis and neck abscess


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2141-9-9**]:
Removal of hardware at C5-C6, redo cervical diskectomy at 5-6,
anterior cervical diskectomy at C6-C7, evacuation of paraspinal
abscess. Transcervical incision and drainage of prevertebral
space abscess.
[**2141-9-11**]: Flexible esophagoscopy and I&D of left neck and
supraclavicular fossa.
[**2141-9-15**]:  Incision and drainage of left supraclavicular fossa
abscess and placement of a 20-French Ponsky PEG tube.
[**2141-9-29**]:  CT guidance, an 18-gauge [**Last Name (un) 11097**] needle was inserted
directly into the collection and approximately 6 cc of opaque
light red fluid was aspirated and sent for Gram stain and
culture.
[**2141-10-2**]: PICC line placement.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 year-old woman with h/o C5/6 laminectomy and
anterior fusion in [**5-/2138**], now transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of abscess.

States that she was doing fine neurologically until about one
week ago, aside from rare episodes of non-urge, non-stress
urinary incontinence over the past few months.  Approximately
one week ago, she was standing when her legs suddenly became
weak bilaterally, and she fell. She does not report any head
trauma or other subsequent injury. Since that time, she has
noted multiple other symptoms including tactile fevers, shaking
chills, throat pain, dysphagia, right sided rib pain,
odynophagia, anterior neck pain and swelling. She presented a
few days ago to [**Hospital3 **]. She had a CXR taken which
revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ?atypical
pneumonitis. She was subsequently admitted to the medical
service. Subsequent work up included a barium swallow study
which, per report, was concerning for a ruptured esophageal
diverticulum.  CT neck was reportedly normal, but CT chest
showed a ring enhancing area anterior to C5-C7 vertebral bodies.
 Enhancement was noted on MRI C spine as well. She was started
on antibiotics while at [**Hospital3 **], after she spiked a
temperature. She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
neurosurgery and ENT evaluation.

1. C5/C6 laminectomy and anterior fusion

[**2141-9-9**] CT CHEST W/CONTRAST
1. Diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] and dependent ground glass opacities
likely representing aspiration.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
3. Please see CT neck examination performed on the same day for
comment on irregular fluid-filled lower cervical esophagus with
paraesophageal foci of air. Esophageal rupture cannot be
excluded.
4. 7-mm left upper lobe nodule. This may be infectious or
inflammatory in etiology, but can be followed with dedicated
chest CT in three months.

[**9-9**] CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple small abscesses, obliteration of the deep and
superficial fascial planes, and stranding and emphysema centered
at C5/6. What is presumed to be the esophagus in this region is
irregular and fluid filled and esophageal perforation cannot be
excluded and would best be evaluated via contrast esophagogram
with fluoroscopy. Heterotopic bone posterior to the esophagus at
this location may indicate mechanism of injury. Given
obliteration of the deep and superficial fascial planes and
extensive subcutaneous emphysema, a rapidly spreading infection
also cannot be excluded and close clinical correlation is
recommended.



CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2141-9-11**]
1. Perforation of the posterior esophagus at the C4/C5 level
with extravasation of oral contrast and connection to the neck
incision. This has caused a massive infectious process with
multiple small abscesses in the left supraclavicular region and
pockets of air which have further increased in extent since
[**2141-9-9**]. There is beginning extension of infectious
process into the superoposterior mediastinum.

2. New development of aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm arising from
the left vertebral artery. As this is in the region of the
planned surgical drainage, special attention is required in
order to avoid vascular injury.

3. Increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions.

4. Slight improvement in multifocal ground-glass opacities and
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities. 7-mm left upper lobe nodule. This may
again be infectious or inflammatory in etiology and can be
followed with dedicated chest CT in three months.

CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTID [**9-24**]

IMPRESSION:

1. Mild interval increase in size of a 1.5-cm pseudoaneurysm of
the left vertebr
