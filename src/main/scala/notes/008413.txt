Final Report
INDICATION: 26-year-old male with gunshot wound to head

FINDINGS: Extensive bullet shrapnel and soft tissue swelling are
seen
overlying a comminuted, displaced skull fracture of the
posterior and left
lateral skull. The fracture extends inferiorly to the level of
the posterior fossa, without definite involvement of the
bilateral carotid canals and jugular foramen. Superiorly, severe
comminution is noted with significant 1.5-2 cm outer
displacement of posterior skull fragments and extension into the
left frontal bone. The fracture lines extend superiorly to
involve the left frontal and temporal bones. There is extensive
intracranial shrapnel seen in the supratentorial region,
primarily along the right aspect of the superior tentorium
cerebelli. There is associated pneumocephalus, with locules of
gas seen along the right posterior cerebral convexity and right
tentorium cerebelli. There is severe outward displacement of two
fracture fragments in the bilateral posterior skull. This is
associated with large bilateral subgaleal hematomas, soft tissue
swelling, and subcutaneous emphysema.

Within the skull, there is a large right subdural hematoma
occupying the
superior right cerebral convexity. This produces mass effect
with slight
effacement of the right lateral ventricle and 6 mm leftward
shift of the
normal midline structures. Hemorrhage is seen tracking along the
bifrontal
convexity anteriorly and posteriorly along the tentorium
cerebelli and left pericerebellar region. There is diffuse
effacement of sulci, consistent with diffuse cerebral edema. The
ventricles and basal cisterns also appear tight. There is no
subfalcine or uncal herniation.

There is partial opacification of the bilateral mastoid air
cells. Fluid is seen in the bilateral sphenoid, ethmoid, and
frontal sinuses. There is mild mucosal thickening of the
bilateral maxillary sinuses, with isolated retention cysts seen
bilaterally. The ostiomeatal units are not definitely visualized
bilaterally due to patient motion, but appear occluded
bilaterally.

HEAD CTA: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major
branches appear patent throughout their courses, with no
evidence of aneurysms, stenosis, dissection, or occlusion. Note
is made of a dominant left vertebral artery.

The venous sinuses are not opacified on this phase of imaging,
and venous
sinus injury cannot be ruled out. This would be of high
suspicion in a
patient with comminuted basilar skull fracture and subdural
hemorrhage.

IMPRESSION:
1. Gunshot wound injury with severe comminuted skull fracture
and
intracranial bone/shrapnel. Bilateral large subgaleal hematomas.

2. Right subdural hemorrhage with moderate mass effect.
3. Diffuse sulcal effacement, suggesting diffuse cerebral edema.
No evidence
of herniation.
4. Intact intracranial arterial circulation. Given the pattern
of injury,
there is high suspicion for venous sinus injury. CT venogram can
be ordered
if there is high clinical suspicion.


Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2191-3-19**]

IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations,
and
routine sampling and automated detections showed no epileptiform

features or electrographic seizures. The background was severely

suppressed, initially showing a burst suppression pattern and
later with
an encephalopathic-appearing slow background, followed by a more

suppressed period again but without sharper features. In all,
the
recording indicates a widespread encephalopathy. Anoxia and
pentobarbital are two possible explanations. During the early
encephalopathic period, the background was more suppressed on
the left.


Radiology Report CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of
[**2191-3-18**] 2:34 PM

FINDINGS: New left subclavian vascular catheter terminates
within the
proximal superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Lungs
are grossly clear except for a small residual area of
atelectasis in the right upper lobe, which was previously
completely collapsed on earlier study at 3:49 a.m..

Radiology Report CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of
[**2191-3-21**] 10:48 AM

FINDINGS:
 CT: Again seen is a bullet in the posterior left occipital soft
tissues, with extensive streak artifact that limits
visualization. There is a comminuted, displaced skull fracture
of the posterior skull, which extends from the skull vertex to
the posterior fossa. There is extensive intracranial shrapnel
seen in the supratentorial region. Changes of right frontal
craniectomy are also seen. There are bilateral frontal subgaleal
hematomas, left greater than right, with associated soft tissue
swelling and subcutaneous emphysema. A drain and multiple
staples are noted in the soft tissues.

Multiple areas of subdural, intraparenchymal, and subarachnoid
hemorrhage are similar in appearance. There is extensive sulcal
effacement and blurring of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junctions,
consistent with diffuse cerebral edema. Hypodense areas noted in
the bilateral parietal lobes and right occipital lobe are
unchanged and may represent ischemia/infarcts. There is no
evidence of subfalcine or uncal herniation. There is no shift of
the normal midline structures.

There is bilateral mild thickening and air-fluid levels in the
maxillary,
sphenoid, and frontoethmoid sinuses. The mastoid air cells are
partially
opacified bilaterally.

HEAD CTA: Visualization is limited by poor bolus injection. The
intracranial carotid and vertebral arteries and their branches
opacify with no evidence of aneurysm, stenosis, or occlusion.
The intracranial vessels appear slightly decreased in caliber,
which may represent poor bolus technique versus minimal-to-mild
diffuse vasospasm.

IMPRESSION:
1. Possible minimal diffuse vasospasm of the intracranial
arteries-
assessment limited due to artifacts and suboptimal bolus timing
.
2. Paranasal sinus disease.
3. Comm
