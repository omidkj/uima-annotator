S/p electrical cardioversion on [**2175-11-27**] for rapid Afib
right knee arthrocentesis

History of Present Illness:
79 yo F with history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **],
pacemaker placement, EF 65%), CRI (baseline Cr 1.4), COPD (on
prednisone taper currently), status-post recent right total knee
replacement ([**2175-11-9**], with pre-operative antibiotics), s/p
TAH-BSO, appendectomy, distant SBO, presenting with RLQ
abdominal pain x several hours, fever. Patient recently
status-post right TKR at [**Hospital6 2910**], with
post-operative course complicated by persistent oxygen
requirement (94-2L => 70s-80s on RA), delirium (described
below).

Was discharged from NEBH on [**2175-11-14**] to [**Hospital 100**] rehab, where
remained until [**2175-11-16**], when was transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] for
presumed CHF, at which time myocardial infarction was excluded
by serial cardiac enzymes, CTA negative for PE. She was diuresed
for elevtaed BNP, but persistently desaturated with minimal
exertion to 80s. Patient was on coumadin post-operatively for
DVT prophyalxis, and developed some hemoptysis (while on bridge
with IV UFH). Her hospital course was complicated by
leukocytosis with CTA evidence of ground glass opacities that
were read as consistent with CHF or pneumonia, for which she was
empirically treated with levofloxacin (completed in-house?). She
was discharged back to [**Hospital 100**] rehab on prednisone taper, pain
control, and lasix for CHF on [**2175-11-23**].

Patient was doing well until the morning of [**2175-11-25**], when she
awoke with achy, non-radiating RLQ abdominal pain, subjective
fever, anorexia. Her symptoms improved and appetite returned
after a BM x 1 (unclear whether bloody, pus, or black), and she
remained stable until the morning of admission ([**2175-11-26**]), when
pain returned in a similar location, and with a similar quality.
In both instances, the pain was constant, and, in the second
case, did not ease with oxycodone or BM. On [**11-25**], fever was
noted to 101.4, and patient was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. No nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, diarrhea, BRBPR,
melena, hematuria, dysuria, back pain, rash, cough, HA, vision
changes, chest pain, increased shortness of breath, increased
joint pain.

Of note, her family has noted some "intermittent confusion"
since her R TKR, consisting of right arm tremor, weakness,
dysarthria/speech difficulty, and dysphagia for liquids/solids.
She has had attacks of difficulty "opening my mouth," though she
claims to comprehend speech, and denies other focal weakness or
numbness, urinary incontinence. These attacks have been ascribed
to medications (opiates), but are not related temporally to
medication administration.

Pertinent Results:
Echo (TEE) [**2175-12-18**]: ____________
.
Echo (TTE) [**2175-12-15**]: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. 3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 4. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. 5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. No obvious evidence of endocarditis seen. 7. Compared with
the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review)
of [**2175-12-4**], there has been no significant change.
.
Echo [**2175-12-6**]: EF>60%. The left atrium is elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2175-12-15**]: A permanent pacemaker remains in place. There has
been placement of a right PICC line, terminating in the superior
vena cava, and a feeding tube, coursing below the diaphragm.
Removal of a left subclavian vascular catheter is noted. The
heart is mildly enlarged. There is vascular engorgement and
worsening perihilar haziness as well as an increasing bilateral
interstitial pattern. Small pleural effusions are noted
bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Worsening congestive heart failure with
increasing interstitial edema.
.
LENI [**2175-12-12**]: No DVT.
.
CXR [**2175-12-8**]: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and greater
caliber to the mediastinal veins suggest cardiac decompensation
is progressed since [**12-4**]. Moderate cardiomegaly is
longstanding. Tip of the left subclavian central venous line
projects over the lateral margin of the SVC and should be
withdrawn 1-2 cm to avoid mural trauma. Transvenous right atrial
and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses
from the right pectoral pacemaker. No pneumothorax.
.
AXR [**2175-12-8**]: Limited study secondary to body habitus. No
evidence of free air. Contrast is seen in the colon, likely
secondary to the patient's video oropharyngeal swallow study.
Gas is seen in the stomach. Note is made of degenerative changes
of the lumber spine. IMPRESSION: No evidence of free air.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
79-year-old female, who recently underwent a right total knee
replacement at the [**Hospital1 **], who was admitted from Rehab for
fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea with leukocytosis and CT
scan evidence of colitis.  Initial hospital course outlined by
problem.
.
## ID:
--C. Diff Colitis: She was initially treated broadly with
levofloxacin and metronidazole since she had been on prednisone
at the Rehab for a COPD exacerbation.  However, once her C. diff
toxin assay returned positive, her antibiotics were weaned to
only metronidazole. Abdominal pain and diarrhea reduced
dramatically after continued flagyl.  Repeat c. diff studies
were negative x4 days.  Her end date for flagyl will be 7 days
after stopping her levoquin.  Ideally we would continue the
flagyl for 7 days until stopping all antibiotics, however to
avoid polypharmacy, ID favors the former plan.
