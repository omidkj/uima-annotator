History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 88 yo woman with h/o dementia, recurrent UTIs,
and CHF, who was brought in by ambulance from her nursing home
with decreasing mental status over the past two days. Of note,
the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2133-2-8**] to [**2133-2-11**]
for an acute left MCA stroke, for which she received TPA. On
that admission, she was also found to have a E.Coli UTI, for
which she was discharged on Cefpodoxime. At the time of her
discharge to her nursing home, she still had residual expressive
aphasia but otherwise did not have any new neurologic deficits.

.
Per her nephew and the [**Name (NI) **] reports, the patient was in her normal
state of health until Tuesday afternoon, when she became more
lethargic and had decreased PO intake. Yesterday, she was able
to get out of bed and participate in activities in her nursing
home; however, she was only interested in going back to sleep in
bed. This morning, she refused to eat and would not get out of
bed, at which point her nursing home decided to send her to the
ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, her initial VS were: afebrile, P 134, BP 78/48, O2
sat 95%. She was found to be in AFib with RVR. Two PIVs were
placed, and she was given 3L of NS. Her pulse decreased to the
110s and her BP increased to 80s-90s. A left IJ was placed, and
she was started on Levophed, and she was given Decadron 10 mg IV
x1 dose. Her U/A appeared infected, so she was started on
Vanc/Cefepime. She also had a CXR, which was concerning for
retrocardiac opacity v. atelectasis. She had abdominal
tenderness on physical exam, so a CT abdomen was performed prior
to admission. Of note, she is a full code, which was reversed on
her last admission by her nephew. On admission, her VS were BP
98/53, P 110, R 16, O2 100% on NRB, CVP 18.
.
On the floor, the patient is lethargic but states that she is
not experiencing any pain. She otherwise has no new complaints.

.
