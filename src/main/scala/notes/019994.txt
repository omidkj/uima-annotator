History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 year old male with known
chronic systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Atrial
fibrillation has been intermittent for the last eight years or
so. Patient was not on Warfarin until suffered an acute
pulmonary
embolus in [**2113-11-15**]. Since [**2113-11-15**], he also has been
on medical therapy for this heart failure with no improvement in
symptoms. Patient actually feels his symptoms have worsened
since
medical therapy was initiated. His main complaints are fatigue
and dyspnea on exertion. He remains very active however, and can
still walk one mile without difficulty. He frequently requires a
"nap". He currently denies chest pain, dyspnea at rest,
orthopnea, PND, pedal edema, palpitations, syncope and
pre-syncope. Patient has already been evaluated by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 89258**],
cardiac surgeon at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7635**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who recommends valve repair
and
Maze procedure. He presents today for second opinion.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2114-7-18**].
LEFT ATRIUM: LA not well visualized.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: RA not well visualized.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. Dilated RV cavity. RV
function depressed. Paradoxic septal motion consistent with
conduction abnormality/ventricular pacing.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen.

MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve leaflets not well seen.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: PVR not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be A-V paced.
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 25-30 %). The right ventricle appears dilated and
depressed.The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are not well seen. The pulmonic valve prosthesis is not
well seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Patient with multiple
dressings on chest following valve surgery, only apical views
obtained. LV function severely depressed, LVEF - 25-30%.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-7-18**],
image quality is suboptimal on the current study. The valves are
not seen clearly. Biventricular function appears similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.[**Known lastname 9036**] was admitted to the hospital preoperatively for a
Heparin bridge, as he is on Coumadin given his history of
pulmonary embolus and atrial fibrillation. Cardiac cath and PATs
were completed and dental clearance obtained. On [**7-20**] Mr.[**Known lastname 9036**]
was taken to the operating room and underwent a mitral valve
repair with a [**Company 1543**] Profile 3D 32-mm ring  annuloplasty/
Tricuspid valve valvuloplasty with a [**Company 1543**] Contour 3D 32-mm
ring/Full left and right-sided Maze procedure with AtriCure
bipolar RF system/ Epicardial left ventricular pacing lead x2,
[**Company 1543**] 35 cm leads, and a Pericardial reconstruction using
CoreMatrix product. Please refer to operative report for further
surgical details. Cardiopulmonary Bypass Time:150 minutes. Cross
clamp time:91 minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU intubated, sedated in critical but
stable condition requiring inotropy and pressor support. He
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident.
He was weaned off pressors, however, beta-blockers were
initially held due to the patient's underlying junctional
rhythm. Electrophysiology was consulted perioperatively for
Mr.[**Known lastname 89260**] need for a possible PPM/ICD with a preop LVEF of
25%. Lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion. On
[**7-23**] Mr.[**Known lastname 9036**] was taken to the electrophysiology lab and
underwent a [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD implant with a [**Company 1543**] End
