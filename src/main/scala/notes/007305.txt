Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for hyptension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
73 year old woman with MMP s/p recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) **]
for persistent fevers who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Rehab for
SBP into 60s [**2155-5-14**]. She has been there since [**4-25**] after admit
for [**Female First Name (un) **] and [**Female First Name (un) **] line infection and pseudomonas in sputum s/p
14 day course caspo/linezolid/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] (to finish [**5-2**] but reportedly
only got [**Last Name (un) 2830**]/linezolid through [**5-7**]). She was noted to have a
hct drop 6/18 to 23 (may have been transfussed 2uPRBC's-not
clear from d/c summary) but hct 29.3 [**1-13**]. Additionally was
hypothermic with elevated WBC, hypernatremia to 157, melanotic
stools. She became hypotensive to SBP 80 [**5-13**] so reportedly
received 2 uPRBC's (though no change in hct) and unknown
quantity of IVF. UOP noted to be only 25cc/hour. C. diff
reportedly negative. [**5-14**]: BP 64/40 [**5-14**] with improvement to
97/70 with 25 gm albumin. Was started on aztreonam 1gm q12 [**5-12**]
(given h/o ESBL resistent organisms/pseudomonas in the past),
vanco 1 gm q24 [**5-14**]. Lab data from [**Hospital1 **] shows hct
30.0->23.5->29.3(? s/p 2 uPRBC's though not clear from d/c
summary)->29.6(s/p 2uPRBC's). Sodium 154, creatinine 0.6, WBC
17.7 (69% PMN, 0 bands, 20% lymph). Blood cultures 6/18 grew 1
bottle coag neg staph, 1 bottle GPC's in clusters. She was
transferred here for further management. CXR reportedly
concerning for LLL process. She was given D5W @ 100cc/hr and
started free water boluses via peg [**5-13**] 300cc q6.

CXR: Bilateral efffusions/pulmonary edema/atelectasis, midline

ECG: NSR (82), axis, intervals NL, low voltage, QW III (old),
TWI III, aVF; V5 uninterpretable. No ST changes.

TEE [**2155-4-22**]: Normal functioning mitral annuloplasty ring with
very mild mitral regurgitation. No vegetations identified.
Complex (non-mobile) aortic atherosclerosis. Small secundum type
atrial septal defect. Regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD.

EEG [**2155-2-27**]: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG due to the
very low voltage, slow and unvarying background, suggestive of
severe
encephalopathy, possibly due to diffuse cortical damamge.
Occasionally focal slowing was seen in the right temporal region
suggestive of subcortical dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73 yo woman with CAD s/p CABG/MVR complicated by
mediastinal hemorrhage, and anoxic brain injury in persistent
vegetative state with h/o GIB, hypotension, GPC's in blood,
decreased urine output, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism.

# Hypotension:
The patient was hypotensive upon admission.  Given a blood
culture positive for GPC in clusters she was started on
vancomycin.  In addition she had grown pseudomonas and serratia
per OSH culture data and was started on zosyn. We treated the
underlying infections and aggressively hydrated the patient with
IV fluids.  In addition we identified a candidal UTI and treated
empirically for [**Female First Name (un) **] sepsis with IV fluconazole.

The patient required vasopressin temporarily but was
successfully weaned and was able to maintain a blood pressure
with systolics in the 90-100's.
.
# Anoxic brain injury/Plan of care:  Per neurologists, the
patient has no meaningful hope of significant neurologic
recovery from her anoxic brain injury.  We consulted social work
and our ethics servie and discussed the objectives of care with
the patient's family and health care proxy.  The family's
decision was made to make the patient DNR, to not escalate care,
and to avoid procedures that would cause pain.
.
# Respiratory failure: Thought to be secondary anoxic brain
injury exacerbated by new-onset PNA.  The patient was kept on
mechanical ventilatory support throughout her stay and was not
successful in attempts to wean.

# H/O GIB:  The patient had guiac positive stool but given her
degree of morbidity it was deemed that an appropriate GI bleed
workup would not be appropriate at that time.  She was
maintained on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI and transfused as necessary.
.
# Hypothyroidism: The patient was found to have elevated TSH to
12 with low FT4 and T3 which was thought to be contributing to
hypotension, hypothermia.  We started her on lev
