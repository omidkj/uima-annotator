Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62 M with a h/o aortic coarctation s/p bypass in [**3-13**]
complicated by sternal wound dehiscence and RV rupture s/p
repair, VRE bacteremia, fungemia, VAP, returning from rehab with
fever.
   This is an abbreviated discharge summary as the patient
quickly recovered to his baseline after receiving antibiotics
for a UTI.  Please refer to previous d/c summary for more
details regarding this patient's multiple medical problems.
.
1) Fevers/hypotension: The patient was noted to have rectal temp
of 104 at rehab with SBPs in the 80s. He had blood and urine
cultures done and received vancomycin, diflucan, cipro and
imipenem there. He was transferred here and UA suggested that
the patient had UTI.  He was given 2 L of IVFs in the ER and
started on stress dose steroids since he had been noted to be
adrenally insufficient at his last admission several days prior.
He was also started on meropenem (for h/o ESBL resistant
klebsiella) linezolid (for h/o VRE) and fluconazole (for h/o
candidemia). He received one dose of flagyl for possible c.
diff.  While UTI was thought to be the primary source of
infection, other possible sources of infection included pleural
effusion (?empyema), persistently infected graft, line
infection, VAP, decub ulcers or potentially c.diff. The patient
remained clinically stable in the ICU and BPs improved with
fluid boluses (It appears from previous admission that baseline
systolic blood pressures have been in the 90s-130s).  He
remained afebriled during his stay and quickly returned to the
baseline he was at when he was discharged several days prior.
His rehab was called and it was discovered he had pseudomonas
growing in a ucx from [**5-6**] (pls see results section for
sensitivity data). Id was consulted and recommended stopping all
abx and starting cipro for UTI. He was also to be re-started on
his suppressive doxycycline. He was discharged back to pulmonary
rehab in stable condition. He will continue on doxycycline and
cipro at rehab. He was also started on replacement steroids for
adrenal insufficiency and will take those daily.
.
2. Resp Failure: The patient had a trach in place from his
previous admission when he was discharged to a vent facility for
long-term weaning. The cause of his resp failure was probably
deconditioning and inability to generate adequate negative
intrathoracic pressure with the flail chest. Additionally, his
stomach has herniated into his thoracic cavity and is further
limiting his breathing. He was continued on the same vent
settings and was discharged back to pulmonary rehab.
.
3. Abdominal pain: Pt had RLQ pain at presenta
