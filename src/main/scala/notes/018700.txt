CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please assess ICH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
51 year old man with s/p ICH x 2 / now on anticoagulation
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please assess ICH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 51-year-old male status post intracranial
hemorrhage, now on anticoagulation.

Heterogeneous focus of high-attenuation is seen within the left
frontoparietal with surrounding vasogenic edema, slightly
improved compared to prior exam from [**2156-3-28**]. Mixed
density extra-axial collection persists along the left cerebral
convexity subjacent to the craniotomy site. A new 4-mm focus of
high- attenuation is seen within the right occipital lobe
(series 2, image 14), likely representing a hemorrhage.

Compared to the prior exam, the degree of sulcal effacement in
the left cerebral hemisphere and mass effect exerted upon the
left lateral ventricle is unchanged. There is no hydrocephalus
or shift of normally midline structures. The visualized sinuses
and mastoid air cells remain normally aerated.
IMPRESSION:

1. Evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left parietal
lobe, with minimal improvement in the surrounding vasogenic
edema since [**2156-3-28**].

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2156-3-13**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Mild regional LV systolic
dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Mildly dilated aortic arch. No 2D or
Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). Increased
AVR gradient. Small vegetation on aortic valve. Trace AR. [The
amount of AR is normal for this AVR.]

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Trivial MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired
relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Thickened pulmonic valve
leaflets. Physiologic (normal) PR.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is very mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal hypokinsis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis. There is a small
vegetation/?thrombus (0.5cm x 0.4cm) on the aortic valve (clip
[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of
regurgitation present is normal for this prosthetic aortic
valve.] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-3-13**],
the small mass on the prosthetic aortic valve is new with
increased transvalvular gradient. The left ventricular systolic
function may be better.
