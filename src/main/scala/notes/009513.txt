History of Present Illness:
77F with history of Crohn's disease, multiple myeloma, anemia
requiring multiple prior tranfusions, who initially presented to
OSH with fevers and suddent onset of bilateral lower abdominal
pain x1 day.  Has had nausea/heaving but no actual emesis, no
diarrhea.  At the OSH, non-contrast CT was concerning for a
possible mass in the pancreas/duodenum, as well as possible
perforation (extraluminal gas noted).  Received zosyn.  Hct was
25, and patient was transfused 3 units pRBCs.  Also got 1L NS.
Sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  HR was in 160s prior to
transfer.

In the ED, initial VS were: 170 97/67.  RR was 32, O2 sat 97% on
2L.  Spiked temp to 102.8.  Patient was fatigued appearing but
oriented x3.  Labs notable for neutropenia with WBC 0.3 (16%N, 1
band, ANC 51), Hct 38.3, plt 61, Na 146, K 2.6, CO2 11, Cr 1.1
(baseline unknown), Ca 6.2, mag 1.1, trop 0.03. Lactate was 4.7.
 LFTs, coags normal.  ABG 7.29/24/83/12.

Repeat CT abd/pelvis here (on prelim read) showed [**Last Name (un) **]
non-hemorrhagic free fluid in abdomen and pelvis w/ periportal
edema, abnormal appearance of the ileocecal junction and
proximal colon, significant wall thickening and inflammation
suggestive of colitis, distal terminal ileum with minimal wall
thickening, and a fluid-filled dilated appendix (14 mm) with
surrounding inflammation (most likely reactive inflammation from
primary process involving proximal colon).  There was no
extraluminal air or oral contrast to suggest perforation on
prelim read.  Patient was seen by Surgery, who reviewed imaging
and felt it was c/w severe colitis, but that there was no
evidence of free air/perforation or acute surgical pathology.
Recommended admission to the MICU, and they will follow along.

While in ED, she was tachy to the 150s-170s, unclear if sinus
tachy vs. SVT.  Patient received adenosine, and per report p
waves seemed to [**Month (only) **] out.  R IJ CVL placed, as well as NGT,
with return of >1L coffee-grounds.  GI consulted.  Was question
of tube being curled on CXR, but as it was still draining, was
left in place.  SBP dropped to 60s-70s. Was started on levophed,
which is currently at 0.24.  She received a total of 4L IVF, and
is currently receiving albumin 12.5 mg per Surgery recs.  Her
lactate has trended down to 3.5-3.6.

Received additional antibiotics with vancomycin 1 gram.
Received fentantyl, dilaudid, and acetaminophen for pain
control.  Zofran for nausea.  Magnesium repleted.  Admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with GI and Surgery to follow.  VS prior to transfer 129
95/53 24 98%.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. 97.3, 126 (sinus) 119/61,
18 98% 2L recieving norepinephrine 0.24 mg/min.  NGT was in
place draining coffee ground appearing material.  Patient was in
considerable discomfort complaining of [**9-12**] abdominal pain.

Per her daughter's report (patient unable to provide due to
pain) she has been having worsening of her chron's symptoms,
specifically diarrhea and abdominal pain over the last month.

and a 14 day course of cipro/flagyl.  She developed nausea and
vomitting while on these medications and self d/c'd the cipro.
Her daughter is unsure whether she continued the other
medications.  She was readmitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**7-12**] with
worsening abdominal pain and after out patient blood work
demonstrated a K of 2.2.  She was again discharged on

[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**7-30**] after her daughter found her at assited
