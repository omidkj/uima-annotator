be monitored in the MICU. Notably, patient has a single lumen
power-port for access and no PIVs. She was ordered 2 units to be
given in ED. IVFs: no ivfs. EKG: no ischemic changes. HR: 67

CT abn/pelvis w/: 1. No acute intraabdominal pathology including
no evidence of bowel ischemia. 2. Multiple hepatic
hypodensities, some of which are newly appreciated and others of
which are less extensive than on the prior exam. Their imaging
appearance is nonspecific, however, given the patient's history
of multiple intestinal AVMs, this appearance could be compatible
with multiple hepatic AVMs. 3. IVC filter, left common iliac
venous stent, and left external iliac venous stent in unchanged
position.

EGD and Colonoscopy: Angioectasias in the fundus and stomach
body (thermal therapy). Angioectasias in the cecum (thermal
therapy).


Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo F with DM2, HTN, chronic anemia and chronic GI bleeding
presenting with recurrent GI bleeding resulting in acute blood
loss anemia, s/p transfusion, EGD and colonoscopy with thermal
therapy treatment of stomach and cecal angioectasias.

The patient presented with complaints of lightheadedness. She
was found to have mild acute renal failure with acute blood loss
anemia (Hct 15 down from 28 1 month prior). She was admitted to
the ICU, received 4 units PRBC's with return of Hct to 28-29 and
resolution of her acute renal failure. Her Hct remained stable
throughout the remainder of her hospitalization. Due to severe
abdominal pain complaints she had an abdominal/pelvis CT without
any signs of an acute pathology. She underwent EGD and
colonoscopy with findings of numerous angioectasias in the
stomach and cecum all of which were treated with thermal therapy
during the procedure. She had no further problems, including
stable Hct and
