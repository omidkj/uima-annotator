PTCA COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a co-dominant system
with
3-vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA had mild luminal
irregularities but
no angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis.  The LAD
had a 30%
stenosis at the origin and a subtotal occlusion of the
mid-vessel with
antegrade flow and retrograde filling via left-left collaterals.
 The
LCx had a large OM1 with a 70% stenosis and an OM2 branch with a
70%
stenosis.  The LPDA branch was small and diffusely diseased.
The RCA
was a co-dominant vessel and was occluded in the proximal
portion with
no evident collateral flow.
  2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated
filling
pressures with equalization of RA, PCW, RVEDP, and LVEDP
consistent with
right ventricular infarction and "pseudo-constriction" pattern.
The
mean RA was markedly elevated at 25mmHg, the PCW was moderately
elevated
at 25 mmHg, and the LVEDP was moderately elevated at 24mmHg.
Right
ventricular presure tracing demonstrated the "square root sign"
with
dip-and-plateau pattern and RV systolic pressure of 38 and RVEDP
of 26
mmHg.  The pulmonary artery pressure was mildly elevated (mean
PA 27
mmHg).  Simultaneous LVEDP and PCW tracing revealed a
respirophasic
variation between early LV diastolic pressure and PCW pressure
greater
than 5 mmHg.  Cardiac index was markedly depressed at 1
L/min/m2.  After
administration of dobutamine 5 mcg/kg/min, cardiac index
increased to
1.3 L/min/m2.  After IABP placement and PCI, the cardiac index
increased
further to 1.75 L/min/m2.  There was no gradient across the
aortic valve
on pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle.
  3.  Left ventriculography was deferred given renal dysfunction
and
need for PCI.
  4.  A 7F 30cc Rediguard intra-aortic balloon pump was placed
via the
left femoral artery with appropriate adjustment of timing for
optimization of diastolic augmentation and systolic unloading.
  5.  Successful placement of two overlapping 2.5 x 28 mm Cypher

drug-eluting stents in the LAD. Final angiography demonstrated a
minimal
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and
normal
flow (See PTCA Comments).
  6.  Successful placement of 2.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting
stent in
the RCA. Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no

angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA
Comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated R and L sided filling pressures consistent
with
biventricular failure.
3. Successful placement of IABP via left common femoral artery.
4. Successful placement of drug-eluting stents in LAD.
5. Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in RCA.

ECHO: Ejection Fraction: 40%. The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with
apical and distal septal akinesis/dyskinesis. The remaining
segments appear hyperdynamic. There was no intracardiac thrombus
seen. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is probably normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94216**] is an 83 year old with woman with hyperglycemia
and RV infarct STEMI, and ARF.

For her STEMI: risk factors include poorly controlled DM and
hypertension. A TTE was obtained to evaluate ejection fraction,
which was 40%. She was started on heparin until catheterization.
Ms. [**Known lastname 94216**] was started on BB, aspirin, and lipitor. Her LFTs
were somewhat high and a cholesterol panel showed good lipid
levels. Therefore, a statin was not started until her LFTs
trended down. A work up revealed that her increased LFTs were
not secondary to hepatitis, but more likely from hepatic
congestion. Once her LFTs were within normal limits, she was
started on atorvastatin, which was titrated up. She was given
mucomyst 600 PO BID x 2 days and pre catheterization IVF with
bicarbonate to protect her kidneys. By discharge, her blood
pressure and heart rate were well controlled on lisinopril and
metoprolol. For her NYHA class III heart failure and her low EF,
she was also started on spironolactone in conjunction with
lasix. She was also started on digoxin and reached appropriate
levels prior to discharge.

Ms. [**Known lastname 94216**] was found to be hyperglycemic with blood sugar
over 500 and an anion gap of 18. It was thought that this was
precipitated by her MI, given that infectious causes were ruled
out with negative urine and blood cultures. At the beginning of
her hospitalization, she was on an insulin drip and later
transitioned back to SQ injections. The [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes servic
