History of Present Illness:
A 59 yo male with HCC and Hep C cirrhosis who was admitted to
[**Hospital3 20284**] Center on [**3-7**] for respiratory failure in the
setting of worsening hepatic ecephalopathy. He was intubated
immediately on arrival in the OSH ED. He was subsequently
diagnosed with a Klebsiella pneumonia, and broad-spectrum
antibiotics were narrowed to Cefuroxime. He was extubated on
[**3-10**], but subsequently reintubated for progressive hypoxic
respiratory failure which failed NIPPV. His course was
complicated by difficulties with IV access, and he sustained
multiple failed attempts at PIV's, PICC's. An attempted at a CVL
on [**3-11**] resulted in a left-sided pneumothorax. An emergent chest
tube and left subclavian line were placed on [**3-12**] after discovery
of the pneumothorax (likely the result of CVL attempt on [**3-11**]).
He was transferred to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for management of his
ongoing medical issues.

Past Medical History:
1. Hepatitis C cirrhosis, previously on transplant list but now
off due to non-compliance. Hx IVDU
2. Multifocal hepatocellular cancer diagnosed in [**10-18**] on
imaging which revealed two enhancing lesions within the liver:
one in high dome of segment VII and the second was lateral to
the bifurcation of the right portal vein. MRI [**2-/2101**] revealed
four dominant arterially enhancing lesions with progression of
at least one lesion. Underwent chemoembolization in [**2101-4-11**] and
RFA [**4-19**]. At last follow-up in [**10-19**], was found to have new
pulmonary nodule in RML, worrisome but not definitive for HCC
met. No evidence of liver recurrence as of [**10-19**].
3. Pneumonia in [**2078**] with prolonged admit, 2 pulmonary
abscesses.
4. Lifelong smoker.
5. Mild COPD.
6. History of narcotic abuse.
7. GERD.

Social History:
Remote hx of EtOH use and IVDA. He is divorced with two grown
children. He lives in [**Hospital1 189**] with his son. Previously he worked
as a substance abuse counselor. His significant other is
girlfriend [**Name (NI) 75025**].

Studies:

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast ([**3-21**]):
1. Cirrhosis with massive ascites, splenomegaly and varices.
Ascites is much increased compared to [**2101-10-6**]. Main portal vein
markedly narrowed, and right portal vein diminutive, without
definite evidence of complete
occlusion.
2. Patient is status post chemoembolization in the right hepatic
lobe, with evidence of tumor extension of a segment VI lesion to
the
diaphragmatic/peritoneal reflection.
3. New 12 mm lesion in segment 3 and 7 mm lesion in segment 7
that are potentially concerning for new foci of HCC. Other
multiple nodules with indeterminate features are unchanged.
4. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with collapse
of both lower lobes. Small left pneumothorax remains after
removal of chest tube. Patchy right upper lobe opacities and
bilateral nodular densities are as previously seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was initially admitted to the ICU where he was successfully
extubated. Speech and swallow consult showed continuing
aspiration. He was transferred to the medicine floor on [**3-17**]. His
hospital course is listed by problem below:

1. Encephalopathy.
This was presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy from
non-compliance with lactulose at home. Upon admission, he was
started on lactulose and rifaximin and started on tube feeds.
With these interventions, his mental status gradually improved
to his pre-admission baseline. After improvement in his mental
status, he was re-evaluated by speech and swallow who cleared
him for soft solid diet with thin liquids. He pulled out his
feeding tube overnight, and it was felt as he was eating
adequately, there was no need to replace the dobhoff tube.

2. Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
He was found to have progression of hepatocellular carcinoma
with an AFP of >3000 up from less than 200. A CT of his chest,
abdomen, and pelvis was done to evaluate for progression of the
hepatocellular cancer. As expected by the elevated AFP, the CT
showed extension of the liver cancer to involve the capsule and
diaphragm. In addition there were several new lesions visualized
in the liver parenchyma. Thus he was no longer a surgical or
transplant candidate.

3. Respiratory Distress.
He was transferred from an OSH intubated in the setting of
left-sided pneumothorax. As above, he was quickly weaned off the
ventilator and extubated in the ICU. Upon transfer to the floor,
bronchodilator nebs were continued for COPD. The left-sided
chest tube (placed at outside hospital for pneumothorax)
continued to drain large amounts of straw-colored fluid, and it
was felt that this fluid was likely draining from his ascitic
abdomen (via the diaphragm) down the path of least resistance to
the pleural space. Thus we spoke with thoracics service and they
agreed to remove the chest tube, as serial x-rays had
demonstrated near complete resorption of the apical pneumothorax
and it was clear the ascitic fluid would continue to accumulate
in the pleural space. Follow-up chest x-rays after chest tube
removal showed stable bilateral pleural effusions. Meanwhile,
his respiratory status improved with diuresis and paracenteses
such that at time of discharge, he is satting mid 90s on 2L.

4. Vancomycin Resistent Enterococcus UTI and SBP.
Cultures from the pleural fluid (presumed to be draining from
the peritoneal cavity) grew out vancomycin-resistent
enterococcus. Meanwhile, urine cultures taken on the same day
grew out VRE as well. Blood cultures were negative, with one
positive coag negative staph culture likely representing a
contaminant. Initially, while the urine and pleural fluid
cultures were still pending sensitivities, he was kept on
ceftriaxone for UTI and presumptive SBP. When the culture data
returned, he was started on Daptomycin. A PICC line was placed
so that he can complete a 14 day course on [**4-6**]. His
mental status improved markedly on the combination of lactulo
