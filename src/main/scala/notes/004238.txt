CXR [**2140-12-26**]
Subtle left base retrocardiac opacity could relate to
atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting an
early consolidation due to infection is not entirely excluded.

CT Neck with contrast [**2140-12-27**]
1. No evidence of retropharyngeal abscess.
2. Prominent lymph nodes in the carotid spaces, but none are
pathologically enlarged.
3. Ectatic right jugular vein is of unclear significance, and
likely a
chronic finding.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions and right mid lung
opacification are
better evaluated on concurrent chest CT.

CT Abd/Pelvis/Chest [**2140-12-27**]
1. Findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia involving the
right lung
2. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Soft tissue in the anterior mediastinum likely represents
thymic remnant. This could be confirmed with MRI if clinically
warranted.
4. Gallbladder wall edema without evidence for cholecystitis,
this may
represent third spacing. Please correlate with albumin level.

ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
26 F with hx of leukopoenia presents with leukopoenia,
neutopoenia and fever.

# Meningitis/Bacteremia: She wasa starteed on broad spectrum
antibiotics including ceftriaxone on admission. An lumbar
puncture was attempted twice but was unsuccessful. However blood
cultures grew neisseria meningitidis. She had high grade fevers
as well as a petechial rash that both improved throughout her
admission. Surveillance blood cultures drawn on several
following days. She did have diffuse myalgias which improved but
did not reso
