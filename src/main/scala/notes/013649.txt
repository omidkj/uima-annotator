Chief Complaint:
perforated duodenal ulcer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy and gram patch

Left laparotomy, evacuation of clot, ligation of
bleeding.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 35 year-old male
who has recently undergone a CABG. He is now postoperative
day 10. He presented with acute onset of abdominal pain,
increased LFTs and focal abdominal tenderness in the right
upper abdomen. He had an elevated white blood cell count of
33. He underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which showed a
fluid collection in the upper abdomen, with an air fluid
level. This was highly suggestive of a perforated viscous. He
was taken emergently to the operating room for exploration.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**2150-8-22**] 11:19 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: aorta, obstruction, liver, appy
Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with diffuse and RUQ pain, inc lfts, US pos
gallstones but no wall/ fluid
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
aorta, obstruction, liver, appy
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 75-year-old male status post CABG, presenting with
abdominal pain today.

COMPARISONS: No comparisons are available.

TECHNIQUE: 64-MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were
obtained with IV contrast only.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is marked inflammation
in the right upper quadrant and right flank with a significant
amount of mesenteric fluid and stranding. There is a focal
loculated area of air-fluid level in the anterior mesentery
measuring 3.5 x 4.4 cm that most likely represents extraluminal
air and fluid. In this collection, there is also hyperdense area
seen on series 2, image 37, of unclear significance. It could
represent a small amount of oral contrast since the patient
received a minimal amount of oral contrast per NG tube. It could
also represent extravasation of IV contrast. Due to localization
of the inflammation findings and fluid around the stomach and
proximal duodenum, these findings are most likely secondary to
perforated duodenal ulcer or distal gastric ulcer. There is mild
inflammation in the ascending colon and hepatic flexure, likely
secondary to the process. The cecum and the rest of the colon
are otherwise unremarkable. The liver and gallbladder are within
normal limits. Fluid around the gallbladder is likely due to the
inflammatory process. The pancreas appears unremarkable. There
are multiple simple cysts in the kidneys bilaterally. There is
no evidence of hydronephrosis. There is a 3.5 cm AAA of the
infrarenal abdominal aorta. This contains mural thrombus. There
is also dilatation of the proximal right common iliac, measuring
up to 1.8 cm (consistent with aneurysmal dilatation). Extensive
calcification of the remaining vessels. No retroperitoneal mass
is seen.

Imaging of the lower lungs demonstrate a moderate-sized left
pleural effusion. There are also patchy opacities in the lung
bases that could represent atelectasis. Pneumonia or aspiration,
however, cannot be excluded.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST ONLY: There is a small amount
of fluid in the pelvis. The urinary bladder, distal ureters,
intrapelvic bowel loops are unremarkable. There is calcification
of the prostate.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions
in the bones. There are degenerative changes of the lumbar
spine.

CT reformations were very important to confirming the
above-mentioned findings and to evaluate the presence for free
extraluminal air.

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute inflammatory changes in the right upper quadrant,
likely secondary to perforation of the duodenum or distal
stomach. There is an extraluminal mesenteric collection of air
and fluid, likely secondary to the perforation.

2. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.

3. Infrarenal AAA measuring 3.5cm. Right common iliac artery
aneurysmn

4. Left pleural effusion. Also
