PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is partial mitral leaflet
flail of P2 scallop. An eccentric, posterior directed jet of The
effective regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2 The mitral
regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Mitral Annulus is dilated.
6. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including Phenylephrine andf in
Sinus rhythm.
1. A well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring is seen with normal
leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 5 mmHg). There is
no valvular systolic anterior motion ([**Male First Name (un) **]). No mitral
regurgitation is seen. A small echogenic structure is noted to
be in the left atrial wall, near where the native P1 and 2 would
have been, about 1 cm cephalad to the mitral annuloplasty ring.
Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], most likely a pledgetted suture that
was placed as part of the valve repair.
2. LV function is Normal.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation
4. Other findings are unchanged
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Final Report
CHEST PORTABLE AP:
REASON FOR EXAM: 35-year-old man with follow up right
pneumothorax.
Since earlier today, sternotomy wires for MVR are unchanged.
Left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is also
stable. Right
pneumothorax persists and may be slightly smaller. There is
overall no other change since earlier today.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on [**11-25**]. Diuresis was begun and he did not
require intubation. Pre-op workup was completed and he underwent
surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**11-28**].  Please see OR report for
details in summary. Patient had MV repair w/28MM [**Company 1543**] ring.
His bypass time was 61 minutes with a crossclamp of 45 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition on phenylephrine and propofol drips. He
remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate post operative
period, was weaned from the pressors and was extubated without
difficulty.

ID was consulted on [**2188-11-28**] due to [**2-15**] blood cultures on
[**2188-11-25**] growing gram negative rods. He was started on IV Zosyn
and Vancomycin post-op day 0.  Later that afternoon Zosyn was
discontinued and Meropenem was started. Vancomycin was continued
until [**2188-11-30**] after negative blood cultures. Final ID
recommendations were made on [**2188-12-2**]. Patient will take Flagyl
500MG PO three times daily for 6 weeks, follow up with ID in 4
weeks.

On POD1 he was begun on beta blockers and diuretics.  He was
also transferred to the step down floor. On the floors he
developed atrial fibrillation transiently for which his beta
blocker dose was increased.  Anticoagulation was begun, in the
event dysrhythmia persisted.  He converted to sinus rhythm and
maintained this at discharge. Warfarin was discontinued on POD 4
due to normal sinus rhythm for greater than 24 hours.  His
hospital course was otherwise uneventful. He was discharged home
on POD 4.
