CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2104-1-4**] 12:49 AM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST

Reason: h/o lung abscess
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
h/o lung abscess
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

ADDENDUM: Proximal to the fluid-filled cavity of the right
middle lobe the middle lobe bronchus approximately 1 cm from its
origin, with intrinsic and some extrinsic component. The
collection splays the right upper lobe anterior segment
subsegmental bronchi at its superior margin (not the medial and
lateral segmental bronchi of the right middle lobe as stated in
the body of the report).
INDICATION: History of lung abscess.

COMPARISON: There are no prior CT exams or radiographs for
comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the chest were
obtained following the administration of 80 cc of Optiray
contrast IV. Coronal reformatted images were generated.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: A 6.7 x 5.8 cm fluid-filled
cavity in the right middle lobe containing small, non-dependent
air bubbles, has a wall less than one cm thick, smooth
internally, and moderately irregular externally. It splays the
medial and lateral segmental bronchi of the right middle lobe,
displaces the right major fissure posteriorly and reaches the
lateral costal pleural surface but shows no sign of extending
into the chest wall.

There is a small right hydropneumothorax, despite a pleural
catheter in place, and at least one small loculation in the
medial mid right chest at the level of the carina. A small
rounded area of atelectasis or consolidation in the posterior
right lower lobe (2A:50) is 20 mm wide. There is a small simple
left effusion, with associated atelectasis. The central airways
are patent to the subsegmental level, except for retained
secretions in the mid trachea.

There is no pericardial effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly involves
all [**Doctor Last Name 1754**]. An RV pacemaker and aortic valve prosthesis are
present. The mitral annulus is heavily calcified. Coronary
arteries are also heavily calcified. The ascending aorta is
midly dilated, 4.9 cm in diameter. The pulmonary arteries are
enlarged, with the right pulmonary artery measuring 31 mm,
suggesting pulmonary hypertension. A right PICC terminates in
the SVC. Multiple borderline paratracheal nodes measuring up to
10 mm are seen.

Several notable findings are seen in the soft tissues, including
a right thyroid nodule measuring 3.3 x 2.8 cm. There is a 4.3 x
4.2 cm rounded lesion of the posterior right upper back
subcutaneous tissue is not fully characterized but may be a
sebaceous cyst. There is asymmetric enlargement of the left
breast tissue, of undetermined significance.

The exam was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
Central biliary prominence is seen. A calcified granuloma is in
the right lobe of the liver posteriorly. Enlarged celiac nodes
measure up to 13 mm.

There are no bone findings concerning for malignancy. There are
degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right middle lobe lung abscess, less likely cavitating
neoplasm. abutting the lateral costal pleural margin, accessible
to percutaneous aspiration.

2. Small, partially loculated right hydropneumothorax, pleural
catheter in place.

3. Mediastinal and celiac axis lymphadenopathy.

4. 3cm right thyroid nodule. Further evaluation with thyroid
ultrasound recommended.

5. 4.3-cm subcutaneous lesion, right upper back, possible cyst,
but best evaluated clinically.

6. Cardiomegaly, mitral annulus and coronary artery
calcifications, enlarged ascending aorta, aortic valve
replacement, and probably pulmonary hypertension.

The right middle lobe abscess or neoplasm was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 41455**] on the afternoon of [**2104-1-4**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

THORACOSTOMY TUBE INSERTION  [**2104-1-9**] 10:59 AM

THORACOSTOMY TUBE INSERTION; CT GUIDANCE DRAINAGE

Reason: place pigtail catheter in right pleural abcess.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old man with right pleural fluid collection
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
place pigtail catheter in right pleural abcess.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Right hemithoracic fluid collection requiring
drainage.

COMPARISONS: Chest CT dated [**2104-1-4**].

PROCEDURE: After explaining potential risks, benefits and
alternatives of the procedure to the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy,
verbal consent was obtained. All questions were answered.
Patient identity was confirmed using three identifiers. A
qualified nurse was present to administer 1 mg of Versed and 50
mcg of fentanyl over 30 minutes, with continuous monitoring.

Limited images of the chest were obtained with the patient in
the left posterior oblique position for localization purposes
only. Images confirm the presence of a heterogeneous collection
with a thick rind in the right middle lobe along the major
fissure, with at least one air locule. A small loculated right
hydropneumothorax is again noted, perhaps slightly increased in
size, with a posterior pigtail catheter in stable position.
Pacemaker leads, sternotomy wires, extensive coronary artery and
mitral annular calcifications are seen in addition to an aortic
valve prosthesis. The heart remains enlarged. Left lower lobe
atelectasis appears mild.

The right lower axilla was marked, prepared and draped in the
usual sterile fashion and 1% lidocaine was used for local
anesthesia. Using CT guidance and trocar technique, a 10 French
catheter was inserted directly into the collection and
approximately 35 cc of purulent hemorrhagic fluid was aspirated,
a portion of which was sent to microbiology. The pigtail was
then formed and the catheter was secured to the skin. Adequate
hemostasis was achieved and there were no immediate
complications. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was an essential participant
in the procedure. Limited post-procedure images revealed slight
interval decrease in the collection size.
