History of Present Illness:
65 y/o F w/NHL s/p nonmyeloablative allo-BMT [**2125**], with
recurrence currently getting abd radiation (# 15/17), who
presented to the ED on [**4-19**] c/o fevers. For details of pt's
presentation, please see [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission note. In brief, the pt
was evaluated on [**3-23**] for fever and was diagnosed with a CAP for
which she was tx'd with levaquin with improvement in sxs.
Several days after stopping the abxs, her fevers recurred and
was placed on another 10 day course of levaquin. Last Saturday,
the pt had sudden onset of fevers, chills, and rigors with fever
up 103.4. In the ED, she had a T 101.8, was tachycardic, and was
sating 96% on 5L NC. A CXR and CTA were significant for a
multi-focal PNA without evidence of PE.
.
Currently, the pt denies fevers, chills, night sweats, cough,
shortness of breath. ROS is also negative for abd pain, n/v/d,
headache, stiff neck. The pt does c/o dysphagia with solids that
occurs at least once a week. Feels that food "gets stuck" in the
middle of her chest.


Past Medical History:
# NHL: Diagnosed [**12/2121**]. s/p nonmyeloablative peripheral stem cell
transplant in [**7-/2126**] with multiple therapies since that time
for recurrent disease. Her more recent chemotherapy was with six
cycles of oral CEPP chemotherapy completed in 10/[**2129**]. Her last
donor lymphocyte infusion was on [**2130-9-19**]. In summer [**2131**]
noted increasing uptake in R uterus and adnexal area with
vaginal wall mass, biopsy c/w lymphoma. Received 2 weeks of
Rituxan [**7-13**], then underwent radiation to area of uptake
completed [**8-13**]. F/u PET showed resolution of uterus uptake, but
new uptake near inferior IVC so she is s/p 4 weeks Rituxan
completed [**2132-12-24**].

IMAGING:
CXR [**4-18**] - Since the prior study, there has been development of
a vague opacity in the right mid lung.  The contour of the
cardiac and mediastinal structures is unchanged.  Pulmonary
vascularity is within normal limits.  There are no pleural
effusions.  Osseous structures again demonstrate mild
degenerative changes of the spine.
IMPRESSION:  New hazy opacity in the right mid lung is
concerning for
pneumonia.
.
CTA chest [**4-18**] - The right thyroid lobe is largely replaced by
multiple
nodules, the largest of which measures 18 x 18 mm, unchanged
from [**2130-10-17**].
There are no filling defects within the pulmonary artery,
proximal, or distal branches to suggest the presence of a
pulmonary embolism.  There is no significant mediastinal,
axillary, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  A subcarinal lymph node
measures 7 mm in short axis.  The heart, pericardium, and great
vessels are normal in appearance.  There is no pericardial
effusion. There is a tiny left pleural effusion with left lower
lobe compressive atelectasis.  Scatterd areas of air space
consolidation in the posterior right upper lobe, right middle
lobe, left lung base and, most prominently, right lower lobe are
consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  Ground glass opacity in
the right middle and anterior right upper lobes support an
underlying infectious etiology.  Global bronchial wall
thickening is unchanged.  The airways are patent to the
subsegmental level bilaterally. Imaging of the upper abdomen is
not sufficient for diagnosis.  A small hiatal hernia is again
noted.  Multiple low attenuation lesions within the liver
parenchyma are unchanged since [**2129**] and likely represent simple
cysts.
BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
osseous
abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
3.  Stable right thyroid nodules.
4.  Liver cysts.
5.  Small hiatal hernia.
.
Bronchial wash [**4-20**] - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Numerous
neutrophils and macrophages.
.
Barium swallow study [**4-22**] - 1.  Small hiatal hernia, unchanged
compared to prior study, with narrowing at the level of
gastroesophageal junction with holdup of 13-mm barium tablet.
Endoscopy is recommended for further assessment of the stricture
at the GE junction.
2.  Infiltrate is seen at the left lower lobe.  No aspiration
was noted at the time of exam.
.
EGD [**4-23**] - Small hiatal hernia, Schatzki's ring
(dilation),Erythema and granularity in the antrum compatible
with chronic gastritis. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of
the duodenum
