History of Present Illness:
HPI: 52 yo female without known PMHx, hasn't had medical care in
many years, was found down 6 days ago and admitted to MICU. Per
patient history, she was watching TV and had drank [**3-13**] alcoholic
drinks that evening. She got a sinus headache and took what she

suicide attempt, nor has she experienced suicide ideation
recently. She states since her husband's death 4 years ago,

support system. She reports 5-7 [**Month/Day (3) 17963**] per week, with 1-3 at one
sitting on the weekends.
.
Likely believed to be a EtOH/benzo/zyprexa overdose. She was
placed on diazepam for CIWA scale, and on levo/flagyl for
aspiration PNA. CXR was negative. LP was negative for bacterial
meningitis, continued on IV acyclovir until MS was cleared.
.
MICU course was complicated by mild withdrawal, resolved.
Persistent tachycardia did not respond to fluid resuscitation.
Mild rhabdomyolysis resolved with IVF. CTA was negative for PE
and transthoracic echocardiogram with preserved LVEF.
.
According to son, he found several vodka bottles at home.  He
reports that she was vaguely suicidal but had no real plans.

for several days and does have a history of addiction,

[**1-9**]  MR HEAD
.
MR HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST

HISTORY: Barely responsive after possible ingestion of foreign
substance.

Sagittal short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was performed
through the brain. Axial imaging was performed with long TR,
long TE fast spin echo, FLAIR, gradient echo, and diffusion
technique. Comparison to a head CT of [**2103-1-7**].

FINDINGS: The study is normal. There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. No
diffusion abnormalities are noted.

CONCLUSION: Normal study.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman with altered mental status, found down,
etoh/tox negative, tachy, vomiting but protecting airway. Unable
to tolerate po contrast. Please eval with IV.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for colitis, diverticulitis, appy, chole
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 52-year-old woman with altered mental status and
tachycardia and vomiting. Please evaluate for intra-abdominal
pathology including colitis.

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from lung bases to
pubic symphysis after administration of 130 cc of Optiray
intravenously. No oral contrast was used. Sagittal and coronal
reformatted images were obtained.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized portion of
the lung bases demonstrates consolidative changes suggesting
aspiration/atelectasis. The visualized portion of the heart and
great vessels appears normal. The NG tube is coiled in the
stomach.

The liver demonstrates mild fatty change. The gallblader,
spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, gallbladder and common bile
duct and pancreas appear normal. Branching hypodense tubular
structures anterior to the portal vein. The stomach, duodenum,
and loops of small bowel and large bowel appear normal. The
appendix was visualized and had normal appearance. No free air
or fluid is noted within the abdomen. No pathologically enlarged
retroperitoneal or mesenteric node is detected. The aorta
contains significant amount of calcification with no aneurysm or
stenosis.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal
ureters, the uterus and adnexa, the rectum and sigmoid colon
have normal appearance. No free air or fluid is noted within the
pelvis. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal nodes are
visualized.

BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesion is
visualized.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intra-abdominal pathology is noted including no
appendicitis, cholecystitis, or colitis.

2. Consolidative changes of lung bases represent
aspiration/atelectasis.

3. Branching hypodense tubular structures adjacent to the portal
vein more likely represnt mild periportal edema (perhaps related
to "fluid resuscitation") than intrah
