Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
slow ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation
Right Atrial Lead Placement Device Upgrade


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30207**] was an 82 year old retired dermatologist with h/o
remote anterior MI with a resultant LV aneurysm/scar with an
LVEF of 25-30%.  He has had intermittent symptoms of congestive
heart failure, easily treated with diuretics. He also has a
history of chronic recurrent slow monomorphic ventricular
tachycardia and is s/p ICD implant in [**2106**].  In prior years, his
VT had not caused any syncope and he would experience one or two
ICD firings per year. Over the past several months, he has had
several episodes where he has had syncope or presyncope, with
episodes lasting minutes at a time. In [**1-/2121**] he was admitted to
his local hospital in [**State 108**] for recurrent syncope and ICD
firing. His workup included a cardiac catheterization. His LAD
was found chronically occluded with collaterals from the RCA.
His OM was stented with a bare metal stent.

On [**2121-3-9**] the patient was readmitted to Palm Beach [**Hospital **]
Medical Center with recurrent near syncope that lasted 2
minutes. On arrival he was noted to have mild CHF. He had some
slow VT on the monitor but it did not trigger his ICD. His
Amiodarone was increased to 400mg b.i.d. and Mexiletine dosing
increased to 150mg t.i.d. Since that time he has not had any
further events. His Amiodarone has been cut back to 300mg b.i.d.
He is now being referred for VT ablation.

Pt underwent VT ablation on [**3-20**], which found two circuits
exiting near the rim of the LV aneurysm. Both VTs were
successfully ablated. Upon arrival to the CCU, the patient
denied chest pain or shortness of breath. He was hemodynamically
and electrically stable. I told the family of the benefits of
atrial pacing to improve his hemodynamics and said we could do
an upgrade next week or the week after. The patient and his
family preferred that the upgrade be done the next day, if
possible, since it would be inconvenient to go back and forth
from the hospital.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2121-3-20**] at 3:15:44 PM      FINAL
IMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion near the
inferolateral wall of the left ventricle without
echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Biatrial enlargement.
Severe global and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
in the presence of a large apical aneurysm. Mild to moderate
aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2121-3-21**] at 1:22:06 PM
FINAL

There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. There is no
pericardial effusion. The Impella catheter is seen in the left
ventricle extending to the apical aneurysm, penetrating deeper
into the left ventricular cavity than would be expected to
provide effective circulatory support. Device was pulled back
under fluoroscopic guidance.

     Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2121-3-21**] at 4:27:40 PM
  FINAL

There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Tip of Impella catheter seen at midventricular level, abutting
inferior posterior wall. Brisk Impella outflow seen in proximal
ascending aorta. Left ventricular end diastolic chamber
dimension (4.0 cm) suggests adequate volume unloading.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small to moderate amount of intrapelvic blood as well as
stranding
surrounding the access site. Moderate amount of blood in the
anterior
pericardial fat space that tracts down to the level of the mid
abdomen on the right.
2. Calcified splenic granulomas.
3. Small non-obstructing renal stone in the right kidney.
4. Small liver cyst and smaller subcentimeter adjacent
