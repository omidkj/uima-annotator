and mild-moderate obstruction of the RUL bronchus; multiple bx
taken from the right [**Hospital1 **] tumor with minimal bleeding controlled

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 42058**] was transferred from [**Hospital3 2737**] intubated
for airway obstruction secondary to right hilar mass obstructing
the right bronchus intermedius.
She was taken to the operating room on [**2149-5-23**] for flexible,
rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and metal stent
placement.  She tolerated the procedure and was transferred back
to the SICU and extubated later that evening.  Aggressive
pulmonary toilet, IV steroids, and nebulizers were continued for
COPD exacerbation. She was transfused with 2 units of PRBC for a
HCT of 23 to HCT 32. She remained in the SICU for respiratory
observation and on [**2149-5-25**] was transferred to the floor. The IV
antibiotics were continued.  The foley was removed.  She was
started on a diabetic diet.  On [**2149-5-26**] the IV steroids were
converted to a PO wean.  Inhalers increased.  Her respiratory
status improved with RA oxygen saturation of 93-95%.  She was
discharged to home on [**2149-5-27**] and will follow-up with her
oncologist  and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
