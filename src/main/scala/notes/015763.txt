[**11-7**] on tacrolimus and currently on HD who presented to the ED
on [**12-30**] with dyspnea and non-productive cough. He developed a
"high fever" and chills with a nonproductive cough on [**12-29**] and

IMAGING:
[**12-30**] CXR AP:  Study is limited by respiratory motion.  Relative
to the prior examination, right internal jugular approach
central venous catheter has been removed.  There is a patchy
opacity in the right lower lobe, highly suspicious for
pneumonia.  Volume status has normalized since the prior
examination.  Again noted is a tortuous aorta.  The cardiac
silhouette remains enlarged but stable.  No definite pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  IMPRESSION:  Limited
examination, highly suspicious for right lower lobe pneumonia.
If clinically feasible, PA and lateral views in the radiology
suite are recommended for better characterization.

[**12-31**] CXR PA/LAT:
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-30**], there is again an
area of patchy opacification in the right lower lobe, highly
suspicious for pneumonia given the clinical history of
immunesuppression. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
some increase in pulmonary venous pressure persists.

[**1-3**] Lspine plain films
AP AND LATERAL LUMBAR SPINE: There is spondylosis of the L5
vertebral body without evidence of spondylolisthesis. No
discrete bony lesions are identified within the imaged bones to
account for the patient's pain. The remaining vertebral body and
intervertebral disc space heights are preserved. Sacroiliac
joints are normally aligned. A catheter projecting over the
right acetabulum represents a pigtail catheter extending along
the course of the ureter, as seen on prior CT scan. Multiple
calcifications in the right lower quadrant likely represent
central calcifications from prior right renal transplant.
IMPRESSION: No discrete osseous lesion within the imaged lumbar
spine to account for the patient's symptoms. L5 spondylosis
without spondylolisthesis, unchanged since [**2187-11-27**].

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia: Due to his initial tachypnea and fever he was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring. He was initially
treated empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics including
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftazidime due to recent
hospitalization. Antibiotic treatment lead to rapid improvement
in his respiratory status and fever curve. He was maintaining
oxygen saturations in mid-high 90's on room air at time of
discharge. Cultures remained negative at time of discharge, and
his outpatient providers should follow up on the final results.
A bacterial etiology due to an encapsulated organism such as
pneumococcus seemed most likely. It was felt that his persistent
leukocytosis at time of discharge reflected his treatment with
neupogen as clinically he was much improved from a respiratory
standpoint. He will continue levofloxacin to complete a 14 day
course of treatment.
.
2. Multiple myeloma: The patient was restarted on his
cyclophosphamide and velcade on [**2188-1-4**]. He will have close
followup in oncology clinic. Prophalaxis with acyclovir and
bactrim was continued. Neupogen was discontinued prior to
discharge.

3. ESRD, s/p renal transplant: The patient's Cellcept had bee
