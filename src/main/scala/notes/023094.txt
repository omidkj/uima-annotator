Brief Hospital Course:
 38 M h/o DM c/b gastroparesis, HTN, CAD s/p MI [**12-21**] with
persistent STE since [**12-21**] who presents with usual syndrome of
n/v/abd pain noted to have persistent STE with ?new STE in V1-2,
no CP/sob. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], VS=98.5 110 234/156 18 100%RA,
pt vomiting. EKG showed new ST elevations in V1/V2 with
otherwise diffuse ST elevations that are unchanged from prior.
Pt was given Dilaudid 5mg iv & ativan 6mg iv for his abdominal
pain and nausea. He was initially given labetolol IV for bp
control to which he did not respond, followed by nitro gtt which
caused precipitous drop in bp to 108/75. Cardiology was
consulted and felt it was unclear if new ST elevations were due
to new ischemic event. Patient was admitted to CCU for
observation and possible cardiac cath in AM. Patient had recent
STEMI in [**12-21**] that presented with L-sided chest tightness
radiating to L arm with associated diaphoresis. During that
admission he was found to have occlusion of LAD distal to D1
with BMS placement.


# CAD/Ischemia: Denies CP or SOB. However may be absent in
setting of DM/neuropathy. Did have L-sided chest tightness on
presentation of initial MI in [**12-21**]. Prior stent to LAD. RCA was
not visualized on prior cath. New ST elevations in V1, V2 with
persistent elevation V3-4. Territory concerning for ongoing LAD
ischemia vs aneurysm, none seen on TTE [**1-20**]. Doubt to be
ischemic event as CE negative (trop positive however in the
setting of renal failure and stable. could be mild form
pericarditis (small effusion on ECHO) or mild demand ischemia in
the setting of hypertensive urgency. We continued ASA, [**Month/Year (2) **],
Lisinopril and BB, with good blood pressure control during the
hospital course.
.
# Pump: chronic systolic CHF. EF 45% [**2187-2-2**] TTE. stable
without signs of decompensation. Continued Lisinopril 40mg po
qdaily, as well as Labatalol.
.
# HTN: pt hypertensive episodes most likely due medication
non-absorption in the setting of nausea and vomiting, due to
gastroparesis. Nausea and vomiting also further trigger for
increase of BP. Once pt's nausea and vomiting well controled
through IV medication, and blood sugar controled with insulin,
patient becomes asymptomatic and BP is much easier to control on
home regiment. Upon discharge arrangements have been made to set
patient up with VNA for medication assistance.
.
# DM: Remained less of an issue and was stable and well
controlled on home regiment of Lantus, and SSI.
.
# ABD PAIN/n/v - similar to prior episodes consistent with
chronic gastroparesis. currently having 3 loose BMs/day, no
recent abx, afebrile. Advanced diet to diabetic diet as
tolerated and prn ativan 1 mg PO/IV Q4H:PRN, dilaudid 1-2 mg IV
Q3H:PRN, reglan prior to each meal.
.
# ESRD: Creatinine 8.9, Pt on HD tue/[**Last Name (un) **]/sat schedule. Pt
continues to make urine, and was diuresed without complication
through his hospital course.
