[**2165-9-27**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel
coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no angiographically
apparent coronary artery disease. The LAD had a 60% mid stenosis
and a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal artery. The LCX
had no obstructive disease. The RCA had 30% ostial narrowing
with no catheter damping.
2.  Left ventriculography revealed stroke volume index of 44
mL/m2 and an EF of 82% with normal regional wall motion. There
was aortic valve calcification and no significant mitral
regurgitation noted.
[**2165-9-27**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
[**2165-9-30**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
3. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
4. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
infero-septal hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
6. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
7. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
8. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
9. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the result.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being AV paced.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 13 mmHg). A trivial perivalvular leak is seen. .
2. The aorta is intact.
3. Left ventricular function is mildly improved.
4. MR is improved to Mild to moderate.
5. The remainder of the study is unchanged.

Final Report
STUDY: Carotid series complete.
REASON: Preop AVR.
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries.
There is heterogeneous plaque in the proximal ICA and distal CCA
bilaterally.
On the right peak velocities are 54, 71 and 65 cm/sec in the
ICA, CCA and ECA respectively. This is consistent with less than
40% stenosis.
On the left peak velocities are 49, 72 and 65 cm/sec in the ICA,
CCA and ECA respectively. This is consistent with less than 40%
stenosis.
There is antegrade vertebral flow bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 84 year old male with a history of aortic
stenosis, who was admitted for cardiac catheterization on
[**2165-9-27**].  Due to his history of renal insufficiency, he was
admitted one day early for pre-procedure hydration.  On
catheterization, he was found to have one vessel disease, with
60-70% lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery.
The patient was further monitored and hydrated for his renal
function.  He was brought to the operating theater on
[**2165-9-30**], where he underwent aortic valve replacement with
21mm porcine tissue valve, and coronary artery bypass grafting x
2 with saphenous vein grafts to the left anterior descending and
diagonal coronary arteries. Please see operative note for
further details.  The patient received vancomycin
peri-operatively because his preoperative inpatient hospital
stay exceeded 24 hours. Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well, and post-
