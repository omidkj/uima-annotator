Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PCI
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
82yo M h/o CAD s/p CABG '[**53**], AS, CHF (EF 20%), HTN, DM2,

intolerant [**3-4**] pancytopenia
5) CVA: [**10-4**] in Broca's area, no residual effects
6) T2DM: with neuropathy, nephropathy
7) Carotid stenosis: [**5-5**] carotid U/S demonstrating moderate
right-sided plaque with 60-69% carotid stenosis. On the left,
there is less than 40% stenosis.
8) Hypertension

Social History:
Retired physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 61032**] in National Institute of Health.
Lives in [**State **] and [**Location (un) **] with wife, no children. No
smoking. Occasional glass of wine. Follows low salt diet. Sugars
controlled to 120-150 mean.


Family History:
Father with rheumatic heart disease, one sister. Mother healthy
until her death at age [**Age over 90 **].


Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 111/70 mm Hg while seated.  Pulse was 77
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min with
an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air and temperature of 97.0.

.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.  The neck was supple with
JVP of 3cm.  The carotid waveform was normal.  There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis.  The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.

Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line.  There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4.  The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, clicks or gallops,
but an audible systolic murmur heard loudest at the upper
sternal border.

The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+  Femoral 2+  Popliteal 2+  DP 2+   PT 2+
Left:  Carotid 2+  Femoral 2+  Popliteal 2+  DP 2+   PT 2+

On transfer to neuro-ICU, his exam was as follows:
NEURO
MS [**Name13 (STitle) **] response to verbal stimuli. Responds to sternal rub by
raising his left arm to resist me. Does not open his eyes
spontaneously but resists eye opening

CN Pupils 2->1.5mm b/l, no blink to threat from right. Eyes
conjugate and roving horizontally with full EOM. + corneal
reflex
on the left, none on the right. No obvious facial droop.

Motor No response to noxious stimuli in the right arm. Withdraws
right leg to pain; moves left arm/leg spontaneously.

Reflexes toes mute b/l.

Two hours later, his left pupil was fixed and dilated, he did
not awaken to noxious stimuli. He had no corneal reflexes but
had a retained gag. He withdrew the left arm and leg to pain,
but the right arm had extensor posturing.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo male with PMH of CAD, 3 vessel CABG, recent aortic
valvuloplasty, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia s/p hospitalization
[**Date range (3) 61033**] with worsening dyspnea related to aortic
stenosis presenting for cath intervention for 80% stenosis at
touchdown of SVG to OM on [**2163-5-9**]. On [**2163-5-10**], he complained of
headache and became difficult to arouse, after vomiting several
times. Stat head CT showed a large left occipital ICH and the
patient was transferred immediately to the neuro-ICU after
intubation. His anticoagulation was rapidly reversed with
protamine, FFP and platelets, and aspirin, plavix, coumadin and
heparin were discontinued; however, two hours later, despite
these measures he was in deep coma, with the left pupil fixed
and dilated and no longer moving the left side, except to pain,
with extensor posturing on the right. Repeat head CT showed
expansion of the ICH into the ventricles, with significant
midline shift and compression of the brainstem (ie, herniation).

Neurosurgery declined intervention after speaking with the
family about his dismal prognosis.

The patient continued to decline, developing bilateral extensor
posturing and among brainstem reflexes he preserved only a weak
gag.

After extensive discussions with the family and the [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy, given that he had clearly stated his wishes
not to be in a dependent, debilitated state, the decision was
made to initiate comfort measures only and the patient expired.
