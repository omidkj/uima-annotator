History of Present Illness:
82 year old male h/o HTN s/p fall 2.5 months ago with

CT here that was stable and was loaded with dilantin. He
currently has no dizziness, headache, numbness, or tingling. The
patient reports having some difficulty walking. He has no SOB or
chest pain. The patient is allergic to aspirin and does not take
any anticoagulation. Of note, he did have a GI bleed 3 years

Radiology
[**2134-6-3**] Noncontrast Head CT:There is a large extra-axial
collection overlying the left cerebral convexity. The collection
crosses the left frontoparietal suture line, measures 2.5 cm in
greatest axial dimension, and demonstrates low attenuation
consistent most consistent with a subacute- to- chronic subdural
hematoma. Note is made of increased attenuation of the
compressed adjacent dura. There is associated 9- mm right
midline shift as well as mass effect on the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of acute
hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal in
size and configuration. The visualized paranasal sinuses are
clear. No fracture is identified.
IMPRESSION: Large left frontoparietal subdural hematoma of
subacute-to-
chronic time course with associated right lateral shift and mass
effect on the left lateral ventricle.

[**2134-6-4**] Noncontrast Head CT:The patient is status post
evacuation of a large frontoparietal fluid collection, with a
transfrontal catheter ending in the cavity. Small amount of
fluid remains present, layering in the dependent portion of the
cavity. Associated 9 mm right midline shift remains present.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage. The ventricles and
sulci are otherwise normal in size and configuration. Moderatel
left maxillary mucosal thickening.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post evacuation of subacute to chronic subdural
collection, with no evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Persistent right lateral midline shift.


[**2134-6-5**] Noncontrast Head CT:Decreased size of post-evacuation
cavity over the left convexity; given attenuation differences in
the fluid over the convexity raises the possibility of a new
slow bleeding with layering - recommend follow up CT to assess.

[**2134-6-7**] Noncontrast Head CT: tatus post interval removal of the
left subdural drainage catheter. No gross interval change in
size of the left convexity subdural hematoma with associated
mass effect detailed above.
