History of Present Illness:
75 M with hx of PUD, PVD s/p fem-fem bypass on coumadin,
emphysema, who originally presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] with one
week of nausea and vomiting, diffuse abd pain, decreased PO
intake, and decreased urination.  No fever, chills, diarrhea, or
melena. Patient was found to be hypotensive to the 80's
systolic.  He was found to have a UTI and received a dose of
levaquin.  He looked sufficicently ill that he was intubated,
had a R triple lumen placed, and an NG lavage showed 1.2 L of
[**Location (un) **] blood return.  His INR was discovered to be 7, Hct 10.2,
lactic acid 12.5, creatinine 2.6, INR 7.3. so he received 4
units of NS, 2 units PRBC and one unit of FFP, as well as 5 mg
IV vitamin K and 5 mg Sub-q.  He was started on ocreotide and
nexium and transferred here for further work-up and management.
.
In the ED, patient remained hypotensive to 80's.  He was started
on vasopressin as a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for concern about possible
esophageal varices.  He was given a dose of flagyl for concern
about possible bacterial translocation and GI was paged.  He had
labs drawn and is getting 2 units of emergency release blood
while waiting for his type and screen to be completed.  He
received a dose of versed for comfort.
He is being admitted to the MICU for close monitoring and
possible endoscopy.

CXR [**2124-5-28**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube is seen with tip
approximately 7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen
with tip coiled in the stomach. Right-sided central venous line
with tip overlying the mid SVC. Cardiac and mediastinal contours
are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity appears within normal
limits. Nodular densities overlying the right upper and mid
lungs again seen, the lower of which possibly represents nipple
shadow. This is not significantly changed from prior. No
definite focal consolidation identified, although the right
costophrenic angle is excluded from the image. IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube with tip approximately 7 cm above the
carina. 2. Unchanged nodular densities within the lungs. Right
upper lobe nodule concerning for possible malignancy, and
further evaluation with CT recommended.
.
from [**Hospital1 4086**] -CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Examination is a little
limited by the lack of oral and intravenous contrast.  Within
the liver, multiple discrete hypodense lesions are seen which
are most consistent with metastatic disease.  There is no
obvious intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation seen.  The
gallbladder is not clearly identified. The spleen is normal.
There is some dilatation of the stomach, the cause of which is
not readily apparent.  The duodenal sweep appears unremarkable.
No [**Hospital1 **] evidence of wall thickening is seen.   No real adjacent
 lymphadenopathy of note.
.
Upper Endoscopy [**5-29**]: Giant duodenal ulcer, nonbleeding, white
base. No visible vessel. Severe esophagitis.
.
Colonoscopy [**6-2**]:
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon
Mass in the mid-transverse colon (injection, biopsy)
Small, yellow, plaque-like lesions on an erythematous base were
noted just poximal to the mass. (biopsy)
Ulcers in the sigmoid colon and descending colon
Edematous and hyperemic in the all visualized portions
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to mid-transverse colon
.
.
Transverse Colon biopsy [**6-2**]:
A. Colon (transverse), mucosal biopsy: Colonic mucosa with
regenerative changes and fragments of fibrinopurulent exudate,
consistent with ulceration.
B. Colon (transverse mass), mucosal biopsy: Fragments of
adenoma.  No submucosa is present to evaluate for invasion.
Multiple levels examined.  .
.
Bilateral ABI [**6-7**]: Doppler waveform analysis reveals a biphasic
waveform at the right common femoral and popliteal arteries with
monophasic waveforms at the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.
The tibial vessels were non-compressible and an ABI could not be
obtained. On the left there are monophasic waveforms at the
common femoral and popliteal with absent DP and PT signals.
Pulse volume recordings reveal mild blunting at the thigh on the
right, there is dampening at the level of the calf and again at
the ankle on the right. On the left there is a severely dampened
waveform at the common femoral level with a further severe
dampening at the calf and a essentially flat trace at the ankle
and metatarsal.
IMPRESSION: Significant left aortoiliac and bilateral SFA and
tibial disease.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
75M with hx of PUD, PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass on coumadin,
emphysema, transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] to our MICU with
severe blood loss anemia, elevated INR, UTI, and sepsis s/p
intubation. Now stable for transfer to the floor with stable
Hct, BP, and breathing on 2L NC O2. Now found to have mass in
transverse colon suspicious for malignancy with mets to liver
and awaiting surgery recs and biopsy results.
.
# s/p UGI bleed: Patient with giant duodenal ulcer which was
likely cause for severe anemia and Hct of 10 upon arrival at
OSH. Received 8U PRBCs in MICU. EGD showing no active bleeding
so blood loss was likely chronic. Patient's Hct has been stable,
is 40 on admission. Patient's supratherpeutic INR (thought to be
[**2-12**] shock liver in setting of sepsis and possible infiltrative
disease) also reversed with FFP. Now INR is normalized. Patient
weaned off continuous PPI. Now on protonix PO BID.
.
# transverse colon/liver lesions concerning for malignancy:
Colonoscopy on [**2124-6-2**] showing 4cm mass in transverse colon
suspicious for malignancy. Given high CEA, normal AFP, and
appearance of liver lesions more consistent with metastasis on
CT scan, most likely this is GI primary with liver metastasis.
