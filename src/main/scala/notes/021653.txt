Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal aorta anuerysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
63 year old African American man with history of hypertension,
diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, benign prostatic
hypertrophy and medication non compliance who was just recently
admitted to the CCU for intramural aortic hematoma requiring
esmolol and nipride drip. At this time, blood pressure was
controlled and followed by serial CT scans which showed no
dissection.

As outpatient, he has repeated CT scans most recently on [**3-21**]
which showed increased size of descending thoracic aortic
aneurysm and resolution of intramural hematoma. patient asked to
see CT surgery by PCP but never made the appointment. He was
seen in PCP office today with BP in 180s/110s and sent to ED for
further evaluation.

In ED, repeat CT scan showed increased size of perfortating
ulcer(2.3 to 3.1cm, no dissection, increased caliber of
descending aorta(5.7 to 6.1cm), He was given esmolol and nipride
with BP in 12s.

He currently denies chest pain/SOB. He does c/o mild back pain
which he had had for 3 weeks. He claims to be compliant to his
medication.

Pertinent Results:
CTA3/18:
Pentrating ulcer of the descending thoracic aorta has increased
in size (2.3
cm to 3.1 cm across). No extravasation of contrast. Intimal
flaps of aortic
arch unchanged. Overall caliber of aorta up to 6.1 cm in
descending thoracic
aorta unchanged.

[**2185-3-21**] CTA:
1. Compared to prior studies of [**2184-9-14**] and [**2184-9-20**], there has
been
resolution of the intramural hematoma although now there is
aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal descending thoracic aorta
and enlargement of the penetrating ulcer. Small intimal flaps
are also noted in the arch. These findings are worrisome for
potential rupture and thoracic surgery consultation is advised.

CTA Repeated on [**9-20**]:
1) Decrease in thickness of para-aortic hematoma. Entire
hematoma not visualized, and there is a questionable intimal
flap, raising suspicion for aortic dissection, but evaluation is

limited due to bolus timing. Further evaluation with MRA is
recommended.
2) Nonspecific area of ground-glass opacity in the right upper
lobe, not present on prior study, and could be due to early
infection or inflammation.
3) Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size, with
bibasilar atelectasis.

MRA ([**2184-9-21**]):
IMPRESSION: Peri-aortic hematoma involving the descending aorta
without evidence of an intimal flap.

echo [**9-15**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated but is not well visualized (cannot adequately
assess for aortic dissection). The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal.with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old African American man with history of hypertension,
diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, benign prostatic
hypertrophy and medication non compliance who was just recently
admitted to the CCU for intramural aortic hematoma. He is
currently admitted for expansion of AAA in the setting of high
blood pressure. His blood pressure has been very resistant to
medication throughout hospital stay. He was initially in the ICU
on IV medication which included esmolol and nipride drip. He was
finally controlled with the BP in 120s-140s on Labetalol 1200mg,
nifedipine CR 90mg, lisinopril 40 [**Hospital1 **], clonidine 0.3, imdur and
dyazide. The importance of medication complaince was stressed
repeatedly. He was seen by social services and was sent home
with VNA service for that purpose. Due to the size of his AAA,
he was initially considered for surgery. GIven that he was
asymptomatic, he will be followed up as outpatient by vascular
surgeon and be considered for elective surgery. Although he has
risk factors for CAD, he was not started on aspirin given the
ulceration in AAA. Of note, he is also noted to have obstructive
sleep apnea but refuses to have CPAP at night. This might be one
of the factors contributing to the hypertension and will need to
be addressed as outpatient. He will also need potassium follow
up given that he has just been started on dyazide.
