Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP

History of Present Illness:
74 yo woman with past medical history of CHF, coronary artery
disease s/p CABG in [**2190**] who presents to the hospital with 4
days of worsening shortness of breath at home. The dyspnea was
worst last night, when she was gasping for air and also had some
associated chest tightness and wheeze. She took a sublingual
nitroglycerin with some improvement in her symptoms. However, at
3 in the morning, she woke up with severe dyspnea, and when her
daughter took her vital signs, her blood pressure was elevated
(unclear to what degree), HR was 111 and her O2 saturation was
64%. The patient has O2 at home which she uses at night normally
at flow of 2L, however the daughter turned up the flow to 10L
with improvement of saturations only to 84%. At this point the
patient's daughter called EMS and she was brought to the
emergency room.
Of note, the patient reports that she is quite limited by
exertional dyspnea and shortness of breath at baseline. She has
23 steps at home, and is able to get up those stairs but only
very slowly. Her exertional dyspnea is predictable and rapidly
resolves with cessation of activites. She also had a recent
admission to [**Hospital3 **] for a CHF exacerbation in [**Month (only) 956**],
at which time she also had a cardiac catherization which per the
patient showed patency in 3 of her 4 bypass grafts. After that
admission, she was weaned off of her lasix by [**Month (only) 547**] due to drops
in blood pressure. She had a stress test in [**Month (only) 216**] which showed
possible perfusion abnormalities in the back of her heart
In the ED, she received 40mg of IV lasix and put out 300cc of
urine. Initially tachypneac to high 30s on intake, diaphoretic.
She was weaned off of the bipap and also given 1g vancomycin and
750mg of levofloxacin. Her most recent vitals where afebrile,
101 111/44 22-25, 100% on 100% non-rebreather. She reports
feeling much better since her admission and is currently chest
pain free.
.
On review of systems, she reports that she has had some recent
URI symptoms. She also has a history of DVTs x2 and had
previously been on coumadin, but has been off of coumadin for at
least 2 years. She has 3 pillow orthopnea. She denies fevers,
chills or rigors. No change in bowel habits. No symptoms of
claudication. No recent weight gain or change in eating habits.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y.o woman with history of CABG and CHF, also DVT who presents
with acute onset of dyspnea and evidence of pulmonary edema,
consistent with a severe exacerbation of congestive heart
failure.
.
# Congestive heart failure: She presented with worsening
dyspnea, diaphoresis, and tachycardia consistent with a CHF
decompensation.  She she had not been on lasix due to labile
blood pressures.  She was admitted to the CCU for diruesis with
lasix and a nitroglycerin drip.  Her lower extremity dopplers
were negative for DVT.  She was transitited to PO lasix on the
floor, with the goal to take 40 mg PO lasix in the am while at
home; this was subsequently changed to 20mg PO the day prior to
discharge due orthostatic hypotension.
.
# CORONARIES:  She had a history of CABG with a recent abnormal
stress test.  Based upon her laboratory data and findings on
EKG, there is no acute evidence of ACS.   Her history is
consistent with chronic stable angina with likely anginal pain
with increased demand from congestive heart failure
exacerbation.  She was placed on a nitroglycerin drip as above,
and continued on ASA 325 mg, and Atorvastatin 80 mg.  Her home
dose of isosorbide was restarted when she was stable on the
floor.
.
# Hypertension: She was continued on her quinipril throughout
her hospital course.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Initially her home insulin of 70/30 was
converted to NPH, and she was maintained on NPH with 20U in
morning and 8U at night.  She was given
