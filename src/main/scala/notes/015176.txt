Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 5448**] is an 89yo pt with h/o CAD s/p RCA stent in [**2124**],
a-fib on warfarin and dofetilide, who presented to OSH on
[**2132-12-7**] with CHF exacerbation. BNP was 326 (1-100). CT ruled
out PE but showed extensive metastatic disease to pleura.
Initial tropI was negative but the 2nd tropI was positive at
1.43 at 7AM and 1.79 at 12:30PM. EKG showed e/o possible prior
septal infarct, no acute ST changes. Cardiology saw her and felt
that, given her age and comorbidity (breast cancer w/mets), she
is not suitable for further intervention and recommended medical
management. Pt was started on nitro patch. However, her primary
cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt otherwise and was willing to cath
her, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization. Per
report, she had an episode of chest pain that responded to nitro
this afternoon. Also, after speaking with medical team at OSH,
the discussion was had about her code status and decision was
made DNR.
.
At home, pt reports passing out 5 days ago. She was getting into
bed, felt SOB, lost consciousness for a couple of minutes. She
reports hitting her head on the left side of her forehead on a
thick rug. Her sons were with her. Episode of SOB while watching
TV as well as +Substernal pressure, rating [**7-13**], no radiation.
No assoc lightheaded, diaphrosis, SOB, n/v, palpitations. No
orthopnea, pedal edema, wt gain. +PND 5 days ago.  She denies
headaches, dyarthia, vision changes, numbness/tingling, focal
muscle weakness, gait disturbance.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5, patient denied any chest pain. However,
she had frequent runs of polymorphic VT, 5-30 seconds each.
Patient was transferred to CCU emergently, given Mg infusion,
started on isoproterenol gtt, which broke the torsades.
Throughout this episode, her BP was stable with SBP in the 110s,
and she remained asymptomatic except for some brief nausea.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery. Pt denies fever, chills, cough, hemoptysis,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, myalgias,
joint pains. All of the other review of systems were negative.

is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms [**Known lastname 5448**] is an 89yo w CAD and a-fib (formerly on
warfarin and dofetilide), who presented originally to OSH w SOB,
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath for NSTEMI, course complicated
by polymorphic VT.
.
# CORONARIES: Pt w known CAD and prior stenting, now p/w NSTEMI
at OSH, s/p cath at [**Hospital1 18**] with bare metal stent to R-PDA. Pt
denies CP/SOB. On heparin drip for NSTEMI at first, then on
heparin to coumadin bridge for a-fb. TTE shows reduced EF. On
discharge, hemodynamically stable, on aspirin, clopidogrel,
beta-blocker, valsartan and atorvastatin.
.
# RHYTHM: History of afib, on coumadin and on dofetilide at
home. Had frequent runs of polymorphic VT with no symptoms on
floor, broke with isoproterenol gtt. Likely induced by
dofetilide in setting of cardiac ischemia and reduced renal
clearance (Cr 1.1, unclear baseline).  Now off dofetilide and
isoproterenol, s/p run of afib with RVR after cath. Metoprolol
used as rate control. Though bradycardia might increase the risk
of ectopic ventricular arrhythmias, it is likely not the cause
of the VT on this admission (VT caused by ischemia/dofetilide).
For afib, pt rate-controlled w metoprolol and anticoagulated w
warfarin w INR goal of [**1-6**]. Therapeutic on discharge, regular
followup recommended. Pt monitored on tele, electrolytes
repleted as needed - K>4.0, Mg >2.0.
.
# PUMP: Likely new diagnosis of systolic CHF, though unclear
whether h/o chronic CHF, unknown EF. Pt does not appear
overloaded on exam. Echo with EF 40-45% with mid to distal
septal and inferior/lateral hypokinesis s/p cath. Beta blocker,
[**Last Name (un) **], furosemide 40mg po daily.
.
# Breast cancer: with mets to pleura. On hormonal therapy; no
chemo or xrt.  Per conversation with oncologist coverage, OK to
not restart aromatase inhibitor (side effect of car
