History of Present Illness:
76 yo AAF w PMHx of CAD, DM, Obesity, COPD who orginally
presented to PCP's office in [**Month (only) 958**] with complaints of shortness
of breath and pedal edema. She was hospitalized at [**Hospital 1263**]
hospital where she was ruled out for MI and treated for both CHF
and suspected aspiration pna w IV lasix and levaquin. Despite
treatment her respiratory status declined and she was intubated
on [**2104-3-6**]. Pt was difficult to wean off ventilator support and
eventually trached on [**2104-3-25**]. Pt continued to have intermittent
fevers for which she was seen by ID and initialy no cause was
found. Pt was then suspected to have cdiff colitis and treated
with flagyl and then vancomycin. Ultimately, pt underwent PEG
placement during which she was found to have esophageal
candidiasis and started on diflucan. H.pylori serology was also
sent, which was positive and she was treated with 10 day course
of clarithromycin, amoxicillin and nexium.
     She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 700**] for
ongoing managment of vent dependent respiratory failure. Per
report, pt improved from a respiratory standpoint there, was
extubated and decannulated and was doing well until on [**2104-4-16**]
she developed nausea and vague abdominal pain. She had a CT on
[**2104-4-23**] that showed two small stones in the distal CD without
intrahepatic biliary dilation. She was managed conservatively
with antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-4-29**] for ERCP to
be done under general anesthesia.

ERCP showed two CBD stones which were removed by performing
sphincterotomy. She had a difficult intubation and remained
intubated on arrival to the medical ICU. She was noted to have
copious secretions and underwent BAL which showed MRSA pna. Pt
was started on vanc and extubated and transferred to floor.

    ERCP showed two CBD stones which were removed by performing

intubated on arrival to the medical ICU. She was noted to have
copious secretions and underwent BAL which showed MRSA pna. Pt
was started on vanc and extubated and transferred to floor.
    Pt's tubefeeds were changed as blood sugars have been
running high and her lantus was increased. She was seen by PT
and is quite deconditioned from her prolonged hospitalization.
.
Below is problem list and plan:
#. Possible cholangitis - [**1-21**] choledocholithiasis sp ERCP with
sphincterotomy and stone removal. Continuing to improve.
-Cont Cipro/Flagyl for 10 days (Day#1 is [**2104-4-29**], end date [**5-9**])
-Blood Cx here neg
.
#. MRSA pneumonia - BAL fluids w MRSA. CXR on [**5-5**] shows
improvement. Cont with Vanc for 10 day course. Day #1 ([**2104-5-1**],
end date [**5-11**]). Pt having copious secretions and placed on
scheduled nebs, guafenesin, frequent suctioning. CXR w
persistent atelectasis - encourage Incentive spirometry. Vanc
trough was therapeutic
.
# Low grade temp - likely from resolving infections and
atelectasis. Cont abx as above. Encouarge incentive spirometry
as above
.
#. Diabetes [**Name (NI) **] - Pts' BS going higher on tube feeds.
Appreciate nutrition recs, TFs changed to Boost glucose. lantus
again to 30 units QHS on [**5-7**]. Cont SSI and titrate up lantus as
needed.
.
#. Hx of Diastolic CHF - Appears to be euvolemic currently. cont
to monitor
.
#. ?Hx of aspiration -  Cont tube feeds for now. Evaluated by
Speech path here and pt needs a video swallow eval.
.
# HTN - Cont lisinopril and HCTZ. Monitor BMP, MP periodically
.
# Multiple decub ulcers - multiple stage III and unstageable
decub ulcers noted on admission. Appreciate wound care recs
.
# Anemia - pt presented with stable anemia with HCT around 25.
She was transfused 2 units prbc while in ICU with appropriate
correction and HCT remained stable near 30 at dc. This can be
further worked up at rehab.
.
. FEN - Tube feeds, NPO, Aspiration precautions
. DVT prophylaxis - SQ heparin. Can be stopped once pt
ambulating frequently
. Code - Full
. Dispo - Back to [**Hospital1 **]
