Pertinent Results:
Micro (summary):
Stool cx [**9-3**] and [**2138-9-17**]: Adenovirus
Blood: Adenovirus VL 3900([**9-23**])-> 5400([**10-1**])-> 600([**10-8**])->
<250([**10-9**])
Blood [**2138-9-14**]: MRSA
Sputum [**2138-9-14**]: MRSA and Pseudomonas (Gent and Cipro resistant)

.
Imaging:
CT abdomen [**2138-10-19**]: Large extracapsular liver hematoma with a
large amount of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic hemorrhagic
ascites which is highly concerning for active bleeding given the
patient's coagulopathy and dropping hematocrit status post liver
biopsy.
.
Liver biopsy [**2138-10-16**]: Marked cholestasis with associated
balloon-cell degeneration. Mild lobular mononuclear cell
inflammation and rare apoptotic hepatocytes. Bile ducts and
vascular structures, with no significant findings. No definite
features of graft-versus-host or [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease seen. No
viral cytopathic effect seen.
Extramedullary hematopoiesis. The main findings in this biopsy
are severe cholestasis in the absence of bile duct damage or
bile duct proliferation. The differential diagnosis includes
drug-induced injury. The absence of bile duct proliferation does
not support an extra-hepatic cause/obstruction of cholestasis.
.
UE US [**2138-9-17**]: Small nonocclusive thrombus about Port-A-Cath in
left subclavian vein.
.
Repeat US [**2138-10-14**]: No evidence of intraluminal thrombus within
the left upper extremity venous system.
.
TEE [**2138-9-25**]: No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
appears
structurally normal with mild mitral regurgitation. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT chest with contrast [**2138-9-14**]: 1. Multiple irregular nodules in
the right upper lobe with patchy nodular and linear opacity in
the left lower lobe. Given appearance and the patient's history,
atypical infection such as fungal infections (such as
aspergillosis) are a primary consideration. Bacterial and viral
pneumonias should also be
considered. 2. Heterogeneous hepatic enhancement. Given
patient's history graft versus host disease was most likely.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a 35 y/o F with GVHD on immunosuppresion now w/
a productive cough, nausea, emesis and acute renal insufficiency
.
TTP/HUS: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to BMT service on
[**2138-9-14**] when she presented with approximately one-month history
of nausea, emesis and worsening productive cough. The patient
was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**8-30**] through [**9-10**] with diarrhea
and fever. During that admission her diarrhea was felt to be a
flare of chronic GVHD. She was placed on higher doses of
steroids and was started on antibiotics given travel history.
She improved symptomatically and was discharged home. She is
chronically on Rituxan monthly (last dose 8/3/6) and Prograf.
When she was readmitted to BMT [**2138-9-14**] she was initially felt
to have TTP/HUS-like syndrome and was initiated on
plasmapheresis. She had a total of 7 plasmapheresis treatments
(last [**2138-10-3**]) and improved symptomatically. She was then found
to have disseminated adenovirus infection (isolated from blood
and stool).
.
Transaminitis: Her hospital course was also complicated by MRSA
bacteremia (TEE negative, treated with Vancomycin x 4 weeks),
and PNA (Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum) treated with Abx. The
patient then was noted to have rising LFTs and direct bilirubin
(total bili peaking at 23.3 with 18.2 direct fraction). She
eventually underwent US guided diagnostic liver biopy on
[**2138-10-16**]. Following her biopsy, the patient was noted to have
decrease in BP (baseline 160-180 systolic to 110-120). She was
otherwise asymptomatic. Her platelet count at the time of liver
biopsy was 45-103. Post-procedure, she was not getting
transfused aggressively with platelets due to concern for
TTP/HUS and her platelets went down as low as 11. On the evening
of [**2138-10-18**] she developed abdominal tenderness and urgent CT
scan of abdomen [**2138-10-19**] showed hemoperitoneum. Hct was 23
post-procedure but she subsequently required 2 units of pRBCs
([**10-16**]) then 2 unitsp RBCs ([**10-18**]) then 1 unit this am ([**10-19**])
and most recent Hct is 21. Surgery was consulted and recommended
conservative management with serial Hct, transfusion support and
close monitoring in the ICU. After her HCT became stable, she
was transferred back to the floor.
.
Diarrhea: Patient has had frequent episodes of diarrhea and
restarted Flagyl on [**9-16**] for explosive diarrhea. C. diff negative
x 2, stool studies negative or pending. Maintained on strict
diet (lactose free, fat free, caffeine free, low residue,
neutropenic). Started prednisone 30mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-17**], which ?may
have improved diarrhea. Stopped flagyl on [**9-18**] and started PO
vanco. Adenovirus POSITIVE on [**9-23**], started tapering prednisone
(now at 10mg QD). By discharge, diarrhea has completely
resolved. Etilogy still remained unclear. Colonoscopy was
performed which revealed no evidence of GVHD.
.
#) Productive cough- she is immunosuppressed. Sputum gram
stains: 4+ GPC's in chains, clusters, pairs; 4+ GNR's, <10 polys
(patient neutropenic); culture showed MRSA and Pseudomonas. CT
showed infiltrates in RUL, LLL. Started Vanco and Ceftaz on
[**2138-9-15**]. Blood cultures 2/4 positive for MRSA; however, decided
to leave port in for now unless gets acutely ill. By discharge
and after Abx treatment, her symptoms resolved.
.
#) Thrombus at site of port: U/S on [**9-17**] showed small
non-occlusive thrombus about the site of the port. No other clot
identified. No actions at this time. She was treated for [**4-17**]
weeks of vancomycin for treatment of MRSA, port presumably
infected. Repeat U/S revealed no evidence of thrombus and
vancomycin stopped.
.
#) GVHD- Continue prograf and stero
