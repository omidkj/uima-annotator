Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, txf from OSH with presumed urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left femoral line
foley catheter changed


History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old male with multiple medical problems
pertinently including DM2 and morbid obesity, being transferred
from OSH with presumed urosepsis. He presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on
the morning of transfer c/o 3 days of increasing lethargy and
AMS. By his report he has been feeling "out of it" for the last
3 days, but can't quite articulate why. He says he's been very
weak and actually fell once, however on further questioning and
review of the notes this has been going on for months. He denies
any headache, photophobia, neck stiffness. ROS positive for
cough over the last week or so, occasionally productive of
sputum, as well as shortness of breath, however he says this is
also a chronic problem. Denies any fevers, chills, abdominal
pain. Has a chronic foley in place for about a year and denies
any pain at the foley site or change in urine color. His
colostomy output has not changed in consistency or quantity. He
is unsure if he has had any recent medication changes, and
mentions that he takes a lot of anti-anxiety medications.
.
At the OSH he was found to be virtually unresponsive,
hypotensive to the 80s systolic. ABG 7.36/64/95 on RA. WBC was
10, with a positive UA (+nitrite, +LE, 20-50 WBC, mod bact). He
received 2L NS, vanco/zosyn and was transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival in the ED here, systolics were 80-90 but improved
with 2 L IVF. He had a central line placed in R groin, however
has not required pressors.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient's vitals were 97.1, HR 53, BP
158/103, RR 11, O2 100% on 4L NC. He was responsive, albeit
sluggish.
.
Of note, patient has been treated for numerous UTIs in the past,
most recently had proteus UTI in [**11-7**], sensitive to Augmentin
and cefuroxime. Has also had pseudomonal and klebsiella UTIs in
the last 1-2 years.


Past Medical History:
1) DM2 diagnosed [**2114**] with triopathy: Creatinine has been as low
as 0.8 in the last couple of years, however widely fluctuant, as
high as 2 in the recent past. 0.9 in [**1-7**].
2) COPD, on home O2. Multiple episodes of respiratory failure
requiring intubation in recent years. Most recently, was
admitted in [**12-6**] with a perforated transverse colon requiring
partial colectomy and transverse colostomy. This course c/b
anticipated respiratory failure and anticipatory tracheostomy,
pseudomonal and MRSA PNA. Also with acalculous cholecystitis
requiring cholecystostomy tube. Had G-tube placed.
3) OSA on CPAP
3) VRE
4) s/p tracheostomy, as above in [**1-7**]
5) HTN
6) CHF: During hospitalization in [**10-20**] it was thought that
failure contributed to his respiratory failure. Last echo was in
[**12-6**] at which time LVEF thought to be roughly normal, however
very poor study and RV not visualized. Not on lasix.
7) Anemia of chronic disease, multiple transfusions in the past

8) s/p BKA for chronic LE ulcer
9) TIA in [**2125**].
10) Difficult intubation; fiberoptic guidance in [**Month (only) 359**] of
[**2131**].
11) Urinary retention.
12) Osteoarthritis.
13) Depression.
14) C. Difficile in [**2129**].
15) Hypogonadism.
16) Morbid obesity
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Bilateral carpal tunnel release in [**2123**].
2. Hydrocele repair in [**2126-4-3**].
3. Quadriceps tendon repair in [**2127**].
4. Status post partial resection of transverse colon, end
transverse colostomy, mucus fistula, jejunostomy tube and
percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2132-12-16**].

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2134-1-3**] 6:27 AM

There is a tracheostomy tube. The cardiac silhouette is markedly
enlarged. There is blunting of both costophrenic angles, right
greater than left, consistent with pleural effusions. There is
no evidence for overt pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.





Brief Hospital Course:
46 year old male with DM2, morbid obesity, p/w hypotension,
positive UA, and presumed narcotics abuse.  These issues
resolved w/ decreased pain meds and fluid resuscitation.  New
finding of [**Female First Name (un) **] growing in blood cx taken [**2134-1-3**] and proteus
miribilis in urine - hemodynamically stable.
.
#) UTI: Has history of recurrent UTIs, resistant to multiple
antibiotics.  UA collected on [**1-3**] grew mixed flora - likely
fecal contaminants.  Repeat U/A after changing foley showed
proteus miribilis.  Started abx to treat given hx multiple UTIs
in this pt w/ diabetes and indwelling catheter.  Gave 5 days of
14 day course of cefpodoxime.  Discussed whether pt needed to
have foley in place - pt feels that he can't make it to the
bathroom in time and does not want to use urinal.  Risk of
recurrent infection was explained but pt wants to keep foley.
Condom cath not possible due to retracted penis.  He will need a
repeat U/A after completion of abx.
.
#) [**Female First Name (un) **] in blood cx:  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 28631**] growing in 1
bottle from [**2134-1-3**]; uncertain whether cultures were taken prior
to fem line placement or after.  Repeat mycolytic cx sent and
LFTs normal - fluconazole started w/ 7 of 14 days remaining.
Ophtho consult to eval for chorioretinitis - no evidence of
fungemia.  Pt clinically stable at discharge and subsequent
cultures unrevealing thusfar.
.
#) pain control:  pt was taking MS contin 100mg tid at home, but
unclear why he has been taking thi
