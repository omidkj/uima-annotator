Allergies:
Zantac / Penicillins / Vancomycin / Levaquin / Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Cardiac catherization with placement of cardiac stent.
- Transfusion of packed red blood cells.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 84 year old female with history of atrial
fibrillation, status-post pacemaker for tachy-brady syndrome,
anemia, and hypertension who presented to the emergency room
with chest pain. Patient states she was doing laundry at home,
sat down, and started to experience severe squeezing chest pain,
about [**9-26**] at rest, around 12:15 PM. Her pain radiated to her
back and jaw. She denies any associated nausea, diaphoresis, or
shortness of breath. She took two sub-lingal nitroglycerin,
however noted no improvement, so she called 911.
.
In the ER, her blood pressure was 112/80, heart rate was 60, and
her oxygen saturation was 100% on room air at presentation. An
EKG was completed which demonstrated ST elevations in V2-V6 and
code STEMI was activated. She was given Heparin, Integrillin
bolus 180, Plavix 600 mg, and ASA 325 mg. She was taken to
catherization laboratory where she had a LAD with 100% stenosis
at origin. She had a bare metal stent placed to LAD. She
complained of severe chest pain with ballon inflation. ECG after
the procedure noted to have STE >5mm V2-V5. Her pain improved
gradully down to [**2200-1-18**].
.
On review of symptoms, she states has been having shortness of
breath for several weeks thought to be secondary to anemia,
which improved after blood transfusion. She does report dark
stools, with colonoscopy within the last year reported to be
"negative."
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. +Chest pain and Shortness of breath.

[**2198-6-30**]: Cardiac Catherization
1. Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed
significant 2 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically significant coronary disease. The LAD had a
100% total
occlusion proximally with a 50% mid stenosis. The LCX was a
large,
dominant vessel without significant coronary disease. There was
a ramus
with a 40% stenosis. The RCA was a small, non-dominant vessel
without
significant coronary disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed a mildly elevated SBP at 148 mm
Hg. A
right heart catheterization was not performed.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PCI/stent to proximal LAD with a 2.5x15mm Vision
stent
and postdilated with a 2.75mm NC balloon. Excellent result with
normal
flow down vessel and no residual stenosis. Patient left cath lab
in
stable condition.
Right heart cath was not peformed because patient on coumadin.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute PCI.
3. Successful PTCA/stent to proximal LAD with bare metal stent.
.
EKG [**2198-6-30**]:
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm.
ST segment elevations in leads I, aVL, V1-V5. Acute anteroseptal
myocardial
injury. Compared to the previous tracing ST segment elevations
are new.
TRACING #1
.
Chest X-ray [**2198-6-30**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic pathology including no
pneumonia or heart
failure.
.
[**2198-7-2**]: Transthoracic Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls, distal
inferior wall and apex. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 25-30 %). Tissue Doppler indicates an increased E/e'
suggesting an increased LVEDP (>18mmHg). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (LAD distribution).
Increased LVEDP.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-4-12**],
regional left ventricular systolic function is new.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 84 year old female with history of hypertension,
atrial fibrillation, tachy-brady syndrome status post pace-maker
placement, who presented with chest pain and EKG findings
concerning for a ST elevation myocardial infarction.

# Coronary artery disease/Ischemia: Patient has a history of
hypertension, but no other significant coronary artery disease
risk factors, and presented with chest pain. Her initial EKGs
were concerning for an anterior ST elevation myocardial
infarction. A code STEMI was activated and patient was taken to
the catherization laboratory. She had a bare metal stent placed
in her proximal LAD which was found to have 100% occlusion. It
was noted that she had worsening of her ST elevations after the
procedure despite TIMI 3 flow and improvement in the patient's
symptoms. It was suspected that she had
