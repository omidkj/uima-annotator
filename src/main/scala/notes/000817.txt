Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB and R arm swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R AV fistula ligation


History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 44 y/o with a hx of ESRD on HD (Tu, Th, Sat), Type II
DM, who p/w SOB x 2 day and R arm pain x 2 weeks. Pt. reports
she has had SOB with exertion since returning from HD on
Tuesday. Reports she has been getting a cold for the last week,
with rhinorrhea and cough productive of yellow sputum. Denies
HA, CP, fevers, reports chronic chills. Says she has had similar
episodes of SOB in the past "when I get fluid overloaded from
dialysis" but that she has been regular about HD so doesn't know
why she would be fluid overloaded now.
.
Pt. also reports getting a R AV fistula placed 1 month ago. She
reports her arm has been becoming painful and swollen for the
past 2 weeks. Says occasionally she'll get pain shooting from
elbow to R thumb, and sometimes her R hand goes numb if she
sleeps on her R, but otherwise denies weakness or numbness in R
hand.
.
In ED: A/A Nebs, ASA, Blood Cx x 2. Transplant surgery asked to
eval R arm fistula, Renal asked to eval for HD.

Pertinent Results:
CTA Chest [**2131-12-26**]: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Congestive heart failure with mild bilateral pleural
effusions.
3) Nonspecific borderline mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4) Tiny ill defined alveolar opacities in the anterior left
upper lobe
anteriorly, nonspecific; possibly infectious in nature; these
should be
reassessed to ensure resolution.
.
Right upper extremity venous ultrasound and Doppler examination,
[**2131-12-26**]:
Examination of the right internal jugular, right subclavian,
right axillary, paired brachial and basilic veins shows no
evidence of deep vein thrombosis. A very limited evaluation of
the fistula suggests that it is patent.
.
Fistulogram [**2131-12-28**]:  Central subclavian occlusion. Limited
outflow of the AV fistula through multiple collaterals in the
arm, shoulder and thoracic wall. The AV anastomosis is patent.
Recommend MR venogram to determine central end of occlusion.
Based on MRI, decision to attempt further venous recanalization
under anesthesia could be considered.
.
MRI/MRA Chest [**2132-1-2**]: MRA of the thorax shows normal pulmonary
arteries bilaterally without central filling defects to suggest
pulmonary embolus. Pulmonary veins are patent and have a normal
appearance. The left ventricle wall appears mildly thickened
raising the question of left ventricular hypertrophy. Chamber
size is within normal limits for all four [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of the heart.
The ascending and descending aorta have a normal appearance
without aneurysmal dilatation, ulcer, or large amount of
atherosclerosis. Bilateral common carotid arteries are widely
patent proximally and patent to their bifurcations. Bilateral
subclavian arteries are also widely patent giving rise to
respective vertebral arteries. The left vertebral artery appears
slightly dominant. No concerning lesions within the arteries.
.
There is marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein a few
centimeters
central to the right chest wall that extends over the entire
more central
portion of the right subclavian vein and right brachiocephalic
vein. The
caliber of the vessel at this level measures between 3 and 9 mm
with multiple areas of stenosis. PICC does extend through the
stenoses and into the superior vena cava. The right jugular vein
is completely thrombosed.
.
The left subclavian vein is markedly irregular with moderate
stenoses but
remains patent to the left brachiocephalic vein. Within the left
lateral
subclavian vein are some filling defects that could represent
chronic thrombus that are nonocclusive. The patient's
double-lumen dialysis catheter enters through the central left
subclavian vein and into the brachiocephalic vein and SVC. There
is minimal contrast around the dialysis catheter throughout its
course within the brachiocephalic vein and superior SVC, which
is narrowed superiorly, however there is slow flow around the
catheter. The left jugular vein is completely thrombosed.
.
Large number of venous collaterals shunting venous blood from
the neck and bilateral upper extremities around the bilateral
subclavian vein and
brachiocephalic vein stenoses. Collaterals are seen within
anterior chest
walls bilaterally, left much greater than right, within the
posterior thorax including the intercostal veins and within the
supraclavicular veins bilaterally. Early on after the injection,
contrast is seen to flow more through these collaterals than
through the bilateral subclavian veins, right brachiocephalic,
and proximal left brachiocephalic vein. The two largest central
collaterals are the azygos vein and the left superior
intercostal vein.
.
There are multiple bilateral enlarged axillary lymph nodes,
which are
nonspecific and were seen on the recent CT scan. Clinical
correlation to
explain this lymphadenopathy is recommended.
.
No definite abnormalities are seen within the upper abdomen on
limited
evaluation. Within the right latissimus dorsi muscle is a 8.6 x
3.6 x 4.0 cm lesion with predominantly fat within it, though
there is some central soft tissue with intermediate T1 and T2
signal. This is not definitely a simple lipoma and therefore
dedicated MRI is recommended to better characterize.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal high-grade stenosis within the right subclavian
vein centrally and right brachiocephalic vein. These vessels are
patent though there is slow flow through them with large venous
collaterals.
.
2. Moderate stenoses within the left subclavian vein and minimal
flow through the left brachiocephalic vein about the patient's
dialysis catheter as well as in the superior SVC which is
slightly narrowed. These lumens are patent, however there is
decreased flow as evidenced by delayed filling and the extensive
collaterals.
.
3. Bilateral jugular vein occlusion inferiorly.
.
4. 8.6 cm fat-containing lesion within the right latissimus
dorsi does
contain soft tissue elements and therefore is not definitely a
simple lipoma. Dedicated MRI is recommended to better
characterize.
.
5. Right greater than left axillary lymphadenopathy is
non-specific and
clinical correlation is recommended
.
CTA Chest [**2132-1-6**]: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Findings most consistent with congestive heart failure.
3. New bibasilar opacities, probably atelectases.
4. Prominent axillary lymph nodes.


Brief Hospital Course:
SOB:  CTA showed findings c/w CHF.  Pt. was aggressively
dialyzed with improvement in her SOB.  After HD #3 she did not
require O2 during the day to maintain O2 sats.  A TTE was
checked and showed and EF of 75% with moderate LV outflow
obstruction, [**12-17**]+ MR, and mild PA hypertension, and high outflow
CHF [**1-17**] her AV fistula was thought to contribute to SOB.
Pulmonary was consulted re: PA HTN contributing to SOB and
recommended PFTs, which showed a restrictive defect, as well as
a RA ABG, which showed a pH of 7.39, PO2 73, PCO2 46, HCO3 29.
She was continued on her CPAP at night.  PA HTN was also thought
to contribute to her SOB.  PE was considered on admission,
