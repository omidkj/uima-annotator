Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5850**] was admitted to undergo an elective Left sided
craniotomy for Left MCA aneurysm clipping. Operative course was

confirm that that the aneurysm clip did not obstruct the MCA and
distal flow.

She was then transported to the Neuro ICU and extubated on
arrival. Her exam was stable post operatively. She was monitored
in the ICU for 24 hours. Her activity was advanced, she was
tolerating a regular diet. She transferred to the neurological
floor and was ambulating in the hallway. The patient was anxious
to leave the hospital. She was neurologically intact, her groin
