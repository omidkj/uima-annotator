Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F with MS, DM2, CAD s/p RCA stent, PVD s/p R BKA, history
of CVA and DVTs, presents with ? seizure activity found to have
9 point Hct drop with guaiac positive stools, refused
EGD/colonoscopy, received 3 units pRBC with appropriate
response, who was hemodynamically stable for the remained of the
hospitalization.
.
# GI bleed: On admission, patient was found to have Hct of 21,
down from baseline of 30, and guaiac positive stool. Admitted to
ICU where she received 3 units of pRBC, bringing Hct to 26. INR
was found to be supratherapeutic at 3 and was reversed with Vit
K, bringing it down to 1.3. GI consulted but patient refused EGD
and colonoscopy. Transferred to the floor and remained HD
stable.
.
# Epistaxis: Patient developed an unprovoked nosebleed, which
stopped after 1.5 hours of pressure. INR was 1.4 at the time and
on heparin drip, which was temporarily held. ENT was consulted
but didn't get cauderization. Treated with nasal spray and
Oxymetazoline. There was no resulting drop in her Hct.
.
# History of DVT/CVA: Patient complained of right leg pain on
admission and LENI ruled out DVT. Given her history of CVA/DVT,
decision was made to restart her home anticoagulation regimen
including coumadin and plavix. Her INR slowly rose and at the
time of discharge it was therapeutic at 2.0.
.
# Seizures: On admission, patient complained of dizziness and
visual changes, consistent with prior seizures, normally evoked
by stress. Neurology consulted but did not find signs of active
seizure. Kept on home dose of tegretol.
.
# Hypertension: Anti-hypertensive medications were initially
held in the context of her GI bleed with resulting blood
pressure 160-180/80-100. Antihypertensives were restarted once
she became HD stable.
.
# CAD: No active signs of ACS despite the low Hct on admission.
EKG without ischemic changes. Once HD stable she was restart on
home plavix dose and also imdur for angina.
.
# DM2: Patient was kept on home regimen of NPH and regular
insulin, with resulting blood sugar ranging from 160 - 250.
