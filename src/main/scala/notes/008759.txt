Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
fiberoptic laryngoscopy
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
71 year old man w/ multiple medical problems including locally
invasive laryngopharyngeal cancer developed approx. 75cc
hemoptysis while at XRT today. He has been spitting and coughing
up several tsps of blood daily or sometimes multiple times daily
for about one month leading up to this. Daily cough, which does
not seem associated with hemoptysis.
.
He was seen by ENT in the ED, who performed fiberoptic exam
through trach and did not see any active bleeding or friable
tissue. CTA of neck was performed to rule out invasion of
carotid sheath.
Of note, he was seen in the ED on [**2107-8-30**] for similar
hemoptysis, at which point the bleeding was thought to be coming
from his tumor and pt was discharged home.


Past Medical History:
Diabetes
Hypertension
Coronary Artery Disease, s/p CABG x 5

CXR: Single bedside AP examination labeled "upright at 5:00
p.m." is compared with study dated [**2107-8-30**]. The patient is
status post tracheostomy, median sternotomy with CABG with
left-sided dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker with intact RA and RV
leads, unchanged. There is evidence of underlying hyperinflation
and probable edema. There is persistent moderately large,
posteriorly-layering right pleural effusion with associated
basilar atelectasis. There is a small left pleural effusion with
left basilar atelectasis, as before. The remainder of the lungs
is grossly clear; specifically, there is no new focal airspace
process to specifically suggest pulmonary hemorrhage. Again
demonstrated are numerous surgical clips and gastrostomy tube in
the left upper central abdomen. IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive
of CHF with bilateral pleural effusions, superimposed on
underlying emphysema. However, there is no distinct new airspace
process to suggest pulmonary hemorrhage. The appearance of the
cervicothoracic trachea and tracheostomy site are grossly
unchanged since the [**2107-8-30**] examination.

CTA Neck:
1. There is redemonstration of an ill-defined, heterogeneous
mass that is filling the left piriform sinus, with obliteration
of the airway. Compared to prior study, this lesion appears to
be more extensive.
2. There is no evidence of active extravasation of contrast.
3. There is a right pulmonary parenchymal consolidation that is
partially imaged.

CT Chest:
1. Large right and mild/moderate left pleural effusion, slightly
smaller compared to the previous exam.
2. No lesion seen in the trachea and lobar bronchi.
3. Extensive vascular disease.
4. Please refer to the report from the CTA Neck from one day
prior for description of the known laryngeal mass.

Brief Hospital Course:
71M with head and neck cancer undergoing chemo and XRT with
worsened hemoptysis
# hemoptysis--likely related to necrosis of either primary mass
induced by XRT.
- bronchoscopic exam of lower airways limited by mass, but no
active bleeding seen
- Hct down to 24.9, transfused one unit PRBCs [**9-14**]
- bleeding likely to continue until large enough total dose of
radiation has been delivered to substantially debulk the mass
.
# SCCa--will contact [**Name (NI) **] team in am to let them know
patient is here; undergoing XRT, which we are attempting to
coordinate while patient is in-house.
Oncology fellow saw patient and explained to him that his
performance status and bleeding prevents him from safely
receiving more chemo.
- morphine and tylenol prn for pain
.
# HTN--poorly controlled on admission, increased lisinopril.
Continue metoprolol, lasix, and clonidine.
.
# COPD--nebs
.
# CAD--h/o CABG but no active issues. Holding ASA since
bleeding.
.
# Diabetes--lantus 10 qhs + SSI.
.
# FEN--TF through PEG.
.
# Ppx--heparin sub-q, ppi
.
