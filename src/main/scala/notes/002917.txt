History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
70 yo man with reported history of COPD, EtOH abuse was found
down, reportedly after a fall from standing.  There was
apparently seizure activity and EMS arrived to find the patient
"post-ictal," incontinent of urine and stool, with some bruising
over the right eye.  He was brought to [**Hospital1 29405**]
and was intubated there after reportedly receiving lidocaine, a
paralytic, and etomidate.  CT of the head showed a left frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a component of SAH.  There was
also concern for a non-displaced frontal bone fracture.  He
apparently had [**3-3**] seizures prior to arrival, unclear timing and
simeology.  He received 2 mg ativan x 2 and was loaded with
cerebyx before arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].  Here, he was given a dose a 2
mg versed in the trauma code prior to the neurosurgical
evaluation.

reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm bilaterally.  Corneals intact
bilaterally.  Extraocular movements intact laterally, no
nystagmus. Facial symmetry difficult to appreciate given
instrumentation.

Normal bulk throughout. No adventitious movements noted.
Moving upper and lower extremities anti-gravity and
symmetrically
without obvious focal deficit.

extremities,
appears to triple flex in lower extremities.

EKG: NSR, no noted ST-T changes

Chest portable: Study is limited by underlying trauma board.
Endotracheal tube seen with tip approximately 4 cm above the
carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coiled with tip within the
stomach.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unremarkable.
Pulmonary vascularity appears within normal limits.  There are
no
focal consolidations.  There are no displaced rib fractures.

IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube seen with tip approximately 4 cm
above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen with tip coiled
within the stomach.  No evidence of displaced rib fracture.

Non-contrast CT head: Reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**], a left frontal
IPH, ~2.4 x 1.7 cm with subarachnoid component noted along
convexity.  There is a gap at the mid-frontal bone that was
concerning for a fracture at the OSH.  However, it appears
somewhat distinct from the area of hemorrhage and there is no
clinical correlate with trauma at that location on examination.
Await official read.

* Appears stable after review of CT head from OSH with
radiology.
We also reviewed CT C-spine that showed no apparent fracture or
other pathology.

[**2120-3-15**] MRI head -
1. No significant change in the acute intraparenchymal hematoma,
with subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, as described above.
Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital
horns, better seen on MR.

2. No definite abnormal enhancement noted in the left frontal
lobe at the site of the hematoma to suggest a vascular lesion.
However, any underlying vascular lesions obscured by the
hematoma cannot be evaluated.

3. Dedicated MR angiogram of the head was not performed on the
present study. Hence, limited assessment for evaluation of
aneurysms.

4. To consider repeating the study without and with IV contrast
as well as MR angiogram, after resolution of the hematoma, for
assessment for any vascular lesions.

6. Moderate sinusitis, as described above, with a few retention
cysts/polyps in the maxillary sinuses.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Remodeling of distal end of the left clavicle suggests old
fracture.
3. AC joint osteoarthritis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the TICU for close monitoring.  His neuro
exam remained stable with moving all 4 extremities and following
commands while intubated.  He was extubated on HD#2.  His repeat
head CT was stable and he was transferred to the floor.  MRI
showed no definitive underlying lesion.  His diet and activity
were advanced. Foley was removed.  Was monitored with CIWA scale
and given ativan occasionally for agitation. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] assumed
care of patient.  He was seen by PT/OT who intially recommended
rehab.  Future visits found pt to be ambulatory with only
observation needed.  The patient had left shoulder discomfort
limiting range of motion and an x-ray revealed osteoarthritis
and an old healed fracture.  No acute PT / OT needs. Pt wishes
to be discharged to [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] SHELTER INTAKE DEPARTMENT FOR
[**Location (un) **] SHELTER PLACEMENT IN [**Hospital1 **].
