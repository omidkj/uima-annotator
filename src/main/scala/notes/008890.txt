Admission Date:  [**2126-2-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2126-3-10**]

Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M

Service:  SURGICAL

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69 year-old gentleman with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post a bone marrow transplant
with refractory thrombocytopenia is admitted with weakness
and confusion.  He was recently discharged from the hospital
with severe thrombocytopenia awaiting potential splenectomy.
He was found to have left hand weakness and noticed that he
could not move his wrist and he was becoming more confused.
He was brought to the Emergency Room for evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with a
bone marrow transplant in [**2124-7-26**] with recurrence
status post chemotherapy.  He also has chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, clot in
the inferior vena cava, glaucoma, chronic low platelets with
past history of ITP and also of myelofibrosis.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Calcium.
2.  Tylenol.
3.  Amicar.
4.  Accolate.
5.  Percocet.
6.  Danazol.
7.  Prednisone.
8.  Prevacid.
9.  Serevent.
10.  Atrovent.

ALLERGIES:  Bactrim.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was awake, but drowsy and
arousable. Temperature is 100.4.  The chest was clear.  There
was gingival bleeding in the mouth.  The abdomen was benign.
On mental status he was oriented to self and to place.  He
was poorly cooperative.  There was decreased strength in his
left upper extremity.

ADMISSION LABORATORY:  Hematocrit of 25.2, platelet count
51,000 after transfusion, which originally was 5000.
Electrolytes were normal.  Glucose 105.  Chest x-ray showed
no infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted with decreased
mental status and thought perhaps to have intracerebral
bleed.  MRI showed some enhancement over the right side of
the brain.  There was a question of carcinomatosis versus
bleed.  However, reread showed a probably small subarachnoid
bleed.  The patient was treated conservatively and attempts
were made to keep his platelets in a reasonable range.  He
was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  He was followed by
the stroke service and neurosurgery.  Over some length of
time he began to improve from a neurological point of view.
He remained febrile.  He was placed on antibiotics.  A lumbar
puncture was performed and there was a question of
meningitis for which he was treated with Acyclovir, Vanco,
Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone.  There was no evidence of
lymphoma on cerebral spinal fluid cytology.  Over some time
he continued to improve.  However, his platelet count still
became a significant problem.  [**Name (NI) **] kept requiring large
amounts of platelet products and had a gastrointestinal
hemorrhage.  Consultation was then obtained again with the
surgical service about the long term goals.  A very long
conversation was again had with the patient and his family
about options and it was thought that perhaps the only way
for the patient to have a reasonable life was to have a
splenectomy, which may decrease the patient's requirement for
platelet transfusion.  It was known that this was a high risk
procedure.

Therefore on [**2126-3-1**] the patient underwent a splenectomy,
which was uncomplicated.  The spleen was somewhat large.
Operation was uncomplicated.  Postoperatively, the patient
initially did reasonably well requiring continued platelet
transfusions though at a much lesser rate.  However, over his
Intensive Care Unit stay he had more difficulty with
respiration and required reintubation for a pneumonia.  He
also then had a higher requirements for platelets and red
cells.  There is no evidence of active bleeding, but the
patient continued to have severe consumption of his platelets
and probably no platelet production.  He was continued to be
followed by the hematology/oncology service as well.  He then
had severe deterioration of his respiratory function with
developing ARDS, increasing respiratory acidosis and dead
space.  Because of his extremely poor prognosis and the fact
that the splenectomy did not improve his platelet problem as
well as severe respiratory failure it was thought that
further measures were to attempt to improve the situation
were futile.  Discussion was had with the family, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in attendance.  The decision was made to
withdraw care, which was done and the patient expired.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe thrombocytopenia.
2.  ITP.
3.  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy and bone
marrow transplant.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  Ventilator associated pneumonia with respiratory failure.
6.  Intracerebral bleed.
7.  Possible meningitis.

No autopsy was performed.
