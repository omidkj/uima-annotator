History of Present Illness:
53 yo M with new diagnosis ([**7-/2148**]) of hepatitis B cirrhosis and
extensive HCC that invades the IVC and right atrium who was
found unresponsive by his family this afternoon.  EMS was called
and fingerstick was 15.  He received an amp of D50 by EMS and
woke up and was brought to the ED.

In the ED, VS remarkable for BP's in the 70-80's, afebrile, hr
in 80's, on 3L nc (his baseline).  Lacate was elevated at 17,
WBC was 17, hct was 25, fibrinogen 127, and INR 2.8.  Tbili was
17.  He was given vancomycin and zosyn.  His CXR had low lung
volumes, but no other acute process.  No paracentesis was done.
Received NS bolus.

Per recent discharge summary diagnosis of Hep B and HCC is quite
new.  He was also diagnosed with a large R sided PE on that
admission.  On review on notes, patient was discharged home on
hospice and was made DNR/DNI.  However, per ED resident, family
states patient is full code.

Spoke with hepatology fellow who reviewed CT scan and states
that patient has very minimal hepatic tissue left given
extensive tumor.  He estimates the patient has days left to
live, that his elevated lactate is indicative of his significant
liver failure.

On arrival to the ICU patient is comfortable.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo M with relatively new diagnosis of hepatitis B and end
stage hepatocellular carcinoma on hospice admitted from ED after
presenting with unresponsiveness and a glucose to 15 at home.
Patient received dextrose and became responsive.  He was
hypotensive to the 70's and admitted to the ICU.  Per extensive
prior notes and in discussion with his wife, comfort was made
the focus given his grave prognosis.  Hepatology was consulted
in the ED and stated that there was no treatment for this
patient given his end stage disease and that his tumor had
essentially eliminated any normal hepatic tissue.

The patient was made comfort measures only with the family at
the bedside and he was treated with iv morphine for pain and
dyspnea which were well controlled.  He expired at 4:32am,
approxomately 3 hours after reaching the floor.  The medical
examiner's office was notified and declined autopsy.  The family
declined autopsy.  ICU attending and patient's PCP were
notified.
