REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Fevers, chills, hyperbilirubinemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease who presented to [**Hospital3 9683**] on [**2115-2-22**] with one day of chills, diaphoresis after
walking progressing to nausea and vomiting and then a band
like lower abdominal pain.  At that time he denies chest
pressure, shortness of breath, diarrhea, cough, bright red

[**Hospital3 **] he was noted to have a temperature of 104.2,
blood pressure 90/50, oxygenation 95% on 2 liters, white
blood cell count 6.4 with 20% bandemia.  He was admitted to
the floor for presumed urinary tract infection and then
became hypotensive to a systolic in the 80s responsive to
fluid boluses.  His liver function tests were elevated with a
total bilirubin of 4.  There was concern for ascending
cholangitis and he was started on Ampicillin and Gentamycin
and then Timentin and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for an ultrasound and possible endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography.  On arrival the patient
complained of mild upper chest pain for approximately ten
minutes and had an electrocardiogram without evidence of
change.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 6.4, hematocrit 44,
platelets 116, bands 20%, AST 906, ALT 933, alkaline
phosphatase 195, total bilirubin 4.6, direct bilirubin 2.5.
Chem 7 142, 3.7, 104, 26, 17, 1.2, 95, INR 1.4, amylase 100.
Urinalysis specific gravity 1.034, positive bilirubin, 30

white blood cells, 1+ bacteria, 0 to 2 red blood cells.
Chest x-ray no abnormalities.  KUB dilated bowel loops.  No
evidence of obstruction.  Electrocardiogram sinus bradycardia
at 58 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST
T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Infectious disease/presumed
cholecystitis:  The patient was continue on Ampicillin,
Gentamycin and Flagyl.  Blood cultures were obtained and were
negative.  Chest x-ray and KUB were obtained as above.  Right
upper quadrant ultrasound was performed demonstrating no
son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign, no cholelithiasis or
cholecystitis, dilated common bile duct without evaluation of
the distal common bile duct secondary to overlying bowel gas,
hypoechoic right lobe of the liver.  CAT scan of the abdomen
and pelvis demonstrated no free air in the abdomen, no
obstruction, evidence of diverticulosis without
diverticulitis.  Small focus of air in the gallbladder with
possible stone in the distal common bile duct with a
prominent proximal common bile duct.  MRCP on [**2-23**]
demonstrated acute cholecystitis with stones in the distal
common bile duct causing dilatation of the common bile duct.
The surgery service was consulted in the Emergency Room and
did not feel that there was need for surgical intervention,
but did recommend that an elective cholecystectomy after
discharge.  An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
was performed on [**2115-2-24**] demonstrating stones of the distal
common bile duct, successful biliary sphincterotomy,
successful stone and sludge extraction.  This procedure was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10108**].  On the day of discharge the
patient's ALT had gone down to 227, AST 78, total bilirubin
2.6 with an alkaline phosphatase of 199.

2.  Hypertension:  The patient was continued on his regimen
of Captopril and Metoprolol.  The Captopril dose was
decreased given the patient's transient hypotension.

3.  Coronary disease:  The patient was continued on aspirin,
beta-blocker and ace inhibitor.

4.  Shock secondary to sepsis:  Initially the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**], because
of concern for shock and sepsis.  However, during his
hospital stay his blood pressure remained within normal
limits.  He was not tachycardic and his temperature was never
above 100.0.  A blood culture obtained from the date of
admission on [**2115-2-23**] did, whoever, grow out Klebsiella
pneumoniae in one out of four bottles that was pan sensitive.
As a result the patient was changed to Levofloxacin and
Flagyl on [**2115-2-26**] for ease of transition to outpatient
regimen.

5.  Pain:  The patient complained of a headache during his
hospital stay.  Apparently this had been present for years
after a fall a number of years ago.  The pain was controlled
with Tylenol and Percocet.

6.  Nutrition:  At the time of discharge the patient was able
to tolerate a full diet.  On [**2115-2-26**] the patient was
transferred to the Medical Floor given that he was no longer
showing signs of septic physiology and the diagnosis of
choledocholithiasis was confirmed and was clearly the cause
of the patient's symptoms and abnormalities.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
1.  Choledocholithiasis.
2.  Cholecystitis.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypotension with questionable sepsis physiology.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW UP:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] [**Hospital Unit Name 52518**], [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 52519**], phone number

cholangiopancreatography.
