Plasmapheresis and central catheter placement; intubation x 2


History of Present Illness:
54yo RH M with history of [**First Name3 (LF) 7816**]-[**Location (un) **] in [**2119**] (treated with
plasmapheresis at [**Hospital1 2025**]) who was well until 2 wks ago when he had
a URI and also was vaccinated for influenza. Friday he had the
onset of bitemporal constant, non-throbbing headache and also
bilateral distal hand and foot paresthesias. These progressed up
his arms and legs over the weekend. This morning, he was walking
to the bathroom and both knees buckled. He feels
that his arms are weak as well, with decreased ability to lift
them antigravity. He has been unable to walk since. He presented

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74606**] was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring and
intubated for airway protection. He was started on a 5 day
course of IVIG. On day #4 he had clinically improved and his
NIF's were good. He was therefore extubated. The following day
however, he became increasingly tachypneic and desaturated. He
was re-intubated and had a 5 second period of asytole during the
procedure after recieving succinylcholine. A pheresis catheter
was placed and he underwent five plasmapheresis sessions over a
10 day period. Given his profound weakness and respiratory
muscle failure, clinical improvement resulting from pheresis
sessions may not begin for at least 14 days following
treatments.

1) Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**]
[**Location (un) **] Syndrome)-
His recurrence of the syndrome likely resulted from URI
secondary to Hemophilus influenza, and possible in the setting
of influenza vaccination. Given his recurrent episode of GBS it
may be warranted to advise against any future influenza
vaccinations. Given the rarity of recurrent GBS alternative
etiologies were considered including arsenic, lead, thallium
toxicity, porphyria, HIV infection, and mycoplasma infection.
Heavy metal tox screens pending at [**Location (un) **] for lead were
negative. He is HIV Ab negative. Urine porphobilinogen was
negative. Dysautonomia encountered with GBS likely relates to
his period of asystole associated with intubation. The patient
also had labile blood pressures- treated with PRN labetalol, and
an ileus (also both relating to dysautonomia). He was evaluated
by the neuromuscular specialists while inpatient. If there is no
improvement 3 weeks following the completion of his initial
course of pheresis ([**2137-9-29**]), a second course of pheresis may
be considered. He will likely have a protracted course of
recovery given the severity of his symptoms at onset. There may
be some benefit to interval EMG testing for prognostication of
recovery in a 3 weeks. He may follow up in the Neuromuscular
Disorders Center at [**Hospital1 18**] once discharged from rehabilitation,
office number ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2528**].

2) Hospital Acquired Pneumonia-
Developed fever and leucocytosis after second intubation on HD
#5. Started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Flagyl for HAP. Vanco
and Flagyl were discontinued once sputum and blood cultures did
not reveal MRSA or anaerobes. He completed a full 10 day course
of Levofloxacin 750mg IV daily while inpatient (ending
[**2137-10-2**]). C. diff screen was negative.

3) Respiratory failure-
Related to respiratory muscle weakness, the patient had very
high vent settings with PEEP of 14, and FiO2 as high as 0.80 to
achieve adeqeuate oxygenation. Bronchoscopy was performed
without secondary etiology for ventilatory
