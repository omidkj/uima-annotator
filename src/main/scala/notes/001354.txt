Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CABGx4 (LIMA>LAD, SVG>RAMUS, SVG>OM, SVG>PDA) [**2127-8-1**]


History of Present Illness:
84M with CAD s/p PTCA in [**2115**], positive stress test in [**Month (only) 956**]
at OSH, cath showing 3VD in [**Month (only) 116**], who was scheduled to undergo
CABG next week, presented to OSH Tuesday evening with substernal
chest pain. He was sitting in his living room, watching the
Celtics game, when he experienced onset of crushing substernal
pain, similar to previous episodes of angina, that was not
relieved by NTG.
At OSH, received NTG SL and then IV, and morphine, and was then
chest pain free. He was transferred here on heparin and NTG gtt.
NTG was d/c'd in [**Hospital1 18**] ED to change over lines/pumps, and not
restarted because pt remained CP free. Additionally given
aspirin, metoprolol, and admitted for further management. CT
surgery was notified of his admission

Final Report
HISTORY: Status post CABG.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-4**], there is
evidence of
bilateral pleural effusions, more marked on the left. Streaks of
atelectasis
are seen in the left mid and lower lung zones. Intact sternal
sutures
persist.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Mildly dilated
descending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass
data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Aymmetric hypertrophy of the Septum near the LVOT is seen.
However no gradient across the LVOT is seen.The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. Aortic sclerosis is seen with a valve area of about 2.2
cm2
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Two jets are seen, one extremely
anterior directed and a second smaller central jet. Prolapse of
the P3 scallop is seen. Mild [**Male First Name (un) **] is seen with no gradient across
the LVOT and valve.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being V paced.
1. Biventricular function is preserved.
2. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**].
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. Other findings are [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**]


Brief Hospital Course:
He ruled out for MI with CEs and had No ECG changes.  His
surgery was moved up because of his symptoms and on [**8-1**] he was
taken to the operating room where he underwent a CABG x 4. He
was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. He was extubated
later that same day. He was started on vasopressin for ? of
SIRS. He was weaned from his vasoac
