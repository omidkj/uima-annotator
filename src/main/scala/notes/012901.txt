Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
85F with severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7cm^2, Peak Velocity 4.6 m/sec, Peak
Gradient, 83 mm Hg),(EF 40-45%), moderate MR, LAD (Diffuse
Irregularities without stenosus), LCx (OM1 50-60%, OM2 70%), RCA
total occlusion, thats presenting to the CCU following cardiac
catheterization.
.
The pt reported that she has had increased DOE over past month
that and thus presented with dyspenea at rest on [**7-26**]. One month
ago the pt reported the ability to climb up to 2 flights of
stairs without DOE. At 4am on [**7-26**] the pt reported PND and the
following morning presented to her PCP where she was noted to
have crackles on exam and LE edema. The pt was subsequently sent
to the ED.
.
While in the ED VS 98 108 126/75 18 100%@3L. EKG showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depression V4-V6. CXR noted b/l pleural effusion and pulmonary
edema, calcified aorta (at the knob).The patient was given
Lisinopril 20mg x1, Albuterol x1, Lasix 20mg IV x1, with
reported improvement of symptoms of shortness of breath. She was
admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service. Upon arrival to the floor the patients
nausea had resolved. Denied chest pain, lightheadedness, back
pain, leg pain or parasthesias.
.
Upon further review of symptoms the pt denies recent fevers,
chills, + increased congestion and cough over the past 2 weeks.
Denies CP, palpitations, n/v, diaphoresis. Denied prior PND.
Uses 2 pillows per night [**1-8**] to cough. The patient denies prior
syncopal episodes.

TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or

CXR ([**2131-7-26**]):
Moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.

EKG ([**2131-7-26**]): Sinus tachycardia. Atrial ectopy. There is a
late transition with tiny R waves in the anterior leads
consistent with possible prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
atrial ectopy is new.

[**Month/Day/Year **] ([**2131-7-27**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior, inferolateral and basal inferoseptal hypokinesis. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 0.7 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe calcific aortic stenosis. Mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2124-12-12**], regional LV systolic dysfunction
appears new. Aortic stenosis has significantly progressed. The
other findings appear similar.

Preliminary findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 1115 hours on
the day of the study.

Cardiac Cathterization ([**2131-7-27**]): 1. Coronary angiography in
this right-dominant system demonstrated
two-vessel coroanry artery disease. The LMCA was without
significant
disease. The LAD had diffuse irregularities without stenoses.
The LCx
was without significant disease, but OM1 and OM2 both had
proximal 60%
and 70% stenoses, respectively. The RCA was proximally occluded
with
right-to-right and left-to-right collaterals and what appeared
to be
diffuse distal disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left- and right-sided
filling
pressures with a means PCWP of 16 mm Hg and a mean RA pressure
of 12 mm
Hg. There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension
with a
PASP of 47 mm Hg. The cardiac index was mildly depressed at 1.9
L/min/m2. There was normal systemic arterial blood pressure.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease with poor distal targets.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old F with h/o HTN, AS, MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], worsening DOE over
the past month, who presented with progressive worsening of
dyspnea on exterion now with shortness of breath at rest.

Shortness of Breath / CHF: The pt. had exacerbation of CHF, as
evident by pulmonary edema, b/l leg edema. The patient was given
20mg IV Lasix with and was maintainted on oxygen therapy to
maintain adequate saturation.  [**Last Name (Titles) **] performed on admission showed
severe calcific aortic stenosis, mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD (EF of 40-45% from 55%
([**12-9**]) as well as moderate mitral regurgitation.

The patient reported some symptomatic improvement after IV Lasix
and the plan was to continue IV Lasix with goal diuresis net 1L
negative per day.  The patient was given low sodiu
