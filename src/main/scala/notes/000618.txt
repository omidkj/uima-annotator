Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-8-20**] Exploratory laparoscopy,lap assisted small bowel
resection


History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year old woman with a history of CAD s/p CABG, R
sided HF on home O2 presenting with LLQ abdominal pain. Sharp
and intermittent squeezing pain in LLQ, [**7-18**] in severity on
admission; no n/v/d, no f/c, no dysuria/hematuria, BRBPR, or
melena. BM yesterday was normal. Never has experienced this type
of pain before; denies postprandial pain. Has had decreased
appetite over past week because has been feeling down due to
second husband's passing. Recently moved back from FL per her
[**Hospital1 **] request when they saw she was depressed.

Initial VS in the ED were T97 HR88 BP100/54 RR18 95% ra. Labs
showed evidence of a urinary tract infection (+WBC, Lg Leuk, Mod
Bx). Lactate was normal, CMP grossly normal, LFTs and lipase
normal. CBC showed a normal white count and a macrocytic anemia
with HCT of 33.1. CT abdomen showed a 12 cm segment of distal
small bowel with circumferential wall thickening and surrounding
mesenteric edema.
Received ciprofloxacn and metronidazole for UTI and vague GI
process. VS prior to transfer were T98.1 HR96 RR18 BP108/73 84
on r/a 91 2L. On the floor, metronidazole was discontinued.

This morning, she is feeling fine. Pain has resolved. Denies CP,
SOB, abdominal pain, n/v, diarrhea, melena, BRBPR. No BM yet
today, passing flatus. Has not eaten since admission. No
dysuria, hematuria.

Note she is unable to give details about any aspects of her
history, including prior diagnosis of UC. She denies any history
of recent diarrhea or BRBPR. Per notes from [**2156**], she was
diagnosed with UC due to symptoms of rectal bleeding and
diarrhea at that time, was on prednisone until [**2157**], when it was
discontinued. Also does not know why she is on prednisone, but
per PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], it is for PMR.

Imaging:
[**2162-8-8**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.  Approximately 12 cm segment of distal
small bowel with circumferential wall thickening and mild
associated mesenteric edema. Findings are concerning for
ischemic, infectious or inflammatory causes of small bowel
enteritis.  Given the dense vascular calcifications, ischemic
etiologies are favored.  However, the aortic branch vessels
appear patent without focal thrombus. 2.  Infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4 cm in transverse diameter. 3.
Duodenal diverticulum. 4.  Stable hepatic cysts.

[**2162-8-9**] KUB: There is a non-specific bowel gas pattern with air
seen in some loops of non-dilated small bowel as well as within
the colon.  Contrast is seen in the colon and in the rectum.  An
IVC filter is in place.  There are splenic artery
calcifications.  There is no evidence of free air or
degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION:
Non-specific bowel gas pattern with no definite obstruction.

[**2162-8-10**] MRE: 1.  Again noted is a 15-cm segment of mid-distal
ileum with wall thickening with edema and mild mucosal
hyperenhancement.  These findings are most likely representative
of an ischemic/infectious etiology affecting the ileumand
unlikely to be Crohn's disease.  Celiac artery, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and
splanchnic veins do not show concerning findings.   2.  3.8 x
3.7 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. 3.  Hepatic cysts
as described above. 4.  Duodenal diverticulum.

[**2162-8-12**] KUB (prelim report): There are mildly dilated gas-filled
small bowel loops as well as decompressed colon with residual
oral contrast. There is no definite evidence of obstruction or
free air. An IVC filter is in place. There is contrast seen
within the large bowel and splenic artery calcifications.
Degenerative changes are noted in the spine. Median sternotomy
wires are present. IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated gas-filled small
bowel loops. No definite obstruction or free air.

[**2162-8-13**] CXR: The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable,
with the
exception of a slight deviation of the tube at the level of the
lower
esophageal third, suggesting the potential presence of a hiatal
hernia.  The site of the tube is located at the gastroesophageal
junction, the tip of the tube projects over the proximal parts
of the stomach.  The tube should be advanced by approximately 5
cm.  There is no evidence of complication, notably no
pneumothorax.  Mild retrocardiac areas of atelectasis.

[**2162-8-14**] LENI's: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis
in bilateral lower extremities.

[**2162-8-14**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricula
