Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo F long time smoker, h/o COPD p/w hemoptysis secondary to
bronchus intermedius mass transferred for endobronchial
intervention and a potential stent placement.
.
# Hemoptysis/Mass: Highly vascular mass concerning for
malignancy was found in bronchus intermedius. Patient underwent
flexible bronchoscopy at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2138-7-25**].  They
performed bronchial washings and biopsies.  Due ot the size of
the mass and obstruction of airway she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for attempted rigid bronchoscopy with stenting.  She arrived to
the hospital intubated. The following morning she underwent
rigid bronchoscopy. Her obstructing mass was not amenable to
stenting but she did have biopsies performed.  She was extubated
and monitored overnight in the ICU.  She tolerated the procedure
well.  She did not have further episodes of hemoptysis.  She was
continued on her home advair and albuterol.  She was started on
codeine for cough suppression.  Patient is schedule to call her
outpatient pulmonologist on Tuesday [**2138-7-29**] to review her biopsy
results and discuss further work up and interventions. She
remained hemodynamically stable throughout admission with stable
hematocrit between 30-33. Patient was counseled on warning signs
of infection or increased bleeding.  She was given a
prescription for Augmentin to take incase she develops fevers or
other symptoms concerning for infection.
.
# Left Cavitary Lesion: Concerning for malignancy associated
with bronchial mass. However, must consider other possibilities
such as vasculitis/infection if biopsy proves to be negative for
malignancy. Lesion will be followed in outpatient setting by her
pulmonologist.
.
# COPD: Patient continued on home advair regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of your
recently diagnosed lung mass.  You were admitted to the ICU for
monitoring of your airway.  You underwent a procedure called a
rigid bronchoscopy that allows the airways to be better
visualized.  A stent was not placed in your airway but biopsies
were taken.  You were taken off the ventilator after the
procedure and continued to do well.  Your blood counts were
monitored closely and remained stable.
.
The following changes have been made to your home medications:
