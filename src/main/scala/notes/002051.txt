Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8071**] is a 63-year-old man who underwent a screening
colonoscopy and was found to have several polyps and a mass at
25 cm.  This was biopsied positive for moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma.  He underwent a CT scan of the abdomen, which
showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  He had no GI symptoms
referable to the colon cancer. After cardiac clearance, and no
evidence of metastatic disease by CT scan, he was taken to the
operating room for definitive resection. Patient underwent
laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with stapled coloproctostomy and
umbilical hernia repair.
.
He returned to [**Location **] 5 from the PACU. He was made NPO and had
IV hydration, IV medications, foley and oxygen via NC. He
started to show evidence of fluid overload, initially O2 sats's
the mid 90s on 5L NC, but had desated to mid 80s requiring NRB.
A CTA was done - negative for PE. He also had an ECHO, which
showed a normal EF. He had been persistently hypertensive and
tachycardic despite hydralazine IV and metoprolol IV. After
stabilizing diurisis and blood pressure control in the ICU, he
returned to the surgical floor requiring oxygen by nasal
cannula.
.
The patient's serum creatinine increased from 0.9 to 1.5 his PO
lasix will be held for a total of 3 days. The pt will follow up
with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2115-2-7**]. Prior to his visit the VNA will draw a
serum creatinine and fax to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]. A discharge summary was
faxed to the office.
.
The pt's blood sugar was 50 on [**2115-2-5**] without any signs or
symptoms of hypoglycemia. This was treated and the pt was
educated on the s/s of hypoglycemia. He was advised to check his
blood sugar before meals and at bedtime and to continue with his
oral diabetic medications. He was advised to call his PCP if his
blood sugar is less than 90 or more than 250. The patient's
staples were removed and steri strips were applied.
.
The patient is currently on home oxygen 2L via NC. He will
continue with this at home. He was evaluated per Physical
Therapy, and cleared for home with oxygen. He was able to
ambulate up and down stairs in hospital prior to discharge with
sats remaining over 95% on 2 liters with minimal assist. It was
recommended he be discharged to a rehabilitation facility
secondary to his acute renal failure and hypoglycemia, but he
refused this. The risks of this were explained to the patient.
Discharge paperwork was reviewed with the patient and he will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] in [**1-22**] weeks and his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2115-2-7**]
