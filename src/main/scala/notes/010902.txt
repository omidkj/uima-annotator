History of Present Illness:
68 year old gentleman with past medical history of AVR, MVR and
septomyomectomy in [**2112**] who now has atrial fibrillation/flutter
which is extremely symptomatic and has been very difficult to
control. He underwent 2 cardoversions in [**Month (only) 956**] and feels
quite well when in normal sinus rhythm however reverts back to
atrial tachycardia after a few days. Despite aggressive medical
therapy
and cardioversions, Mr. [**Known lastname 62250**] continues to suffer from atrial
tachycardia. His symptoms are significant dyspnea with minimal
activity and fatigue.  He presents for admission today for
cardiac catheterization, intravenous heparin to bridge from
coumadin, and preoperative workup for MAZE.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension:  *7.6 cm  <= 4.0 cm
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  *6.8 cm  <= 5.2 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  60%  >= 55%
Aorta - Sinus Level:  3.1 cm  <= 3.6 cm
Aorta - Ascending:  3.4 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  2.5 cm  <= 2.5 cm
Mitral Valve - MVA (P [**2-9**] T):  2.7 cm2
Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move normally. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mechanical mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). Normal
MVR leaflets. Mild mitral annular calcification.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
patient.
Conclusions
PREBYPASS:
The patient is V-paced at a rate of 80 bpm.
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
It is difficult to evaluate the left ventricle due to
reverberation artifact from the mechanical mitral valve and
suboptimal transgastric views but function appears to be within
normal limits.
Right ventricular systolic function appears normal with normal
free wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
mitral leaflets appear normal.
POSTBYPASS:
The patient is on an infusion of phenylephrine and is still
V-paced at a rate of 80 bpm.
The left atrial appendage has been ligated. A small pouch (at
most several millimeters deep) remains without evidence of flow
on color Doppler.
Left ventricular function appears to be unchanged although the
views of the left ventricle are limited.
The mechanical mitral and aortic valves continue to appear
normal without regurgitation.
Aortic contours are normal.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old man s/p MAZE
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for pneumothorax s/p chest
tube removal
Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient after maze
procedure.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2115-9-21**].
The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.
There is
unchanged appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette,
bibasal atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions. Note is
made that the current study was obtained with suboptimal
technique and repeat radiograph for precise evaluation of the
chest is recommended.
