Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M, recently transferred from OSH to neurosurgical ICU on
[**4-1**] for subdural hematoma following a fall.
The patient states that he had 2 falls before the
hospitalization. He fell initially at home in the middle of the
night when he turned off the lights before getting into bed and
fell over the walker. He had imaging which showed a L elbow
fracture and went to short term rehab. He then had another fall
at rehab which was unwitnessed, found face down, although awake
and alert, not remembering how the fall happened. He was brought
to [**Hospital **] Hospital and found to have a left sided subdural
hematoma and was transferred to Neuro ICU for observation. His
aspirin was discontinued and he was started on prophylactic
antiseizure regimen.
Serial cardiac markers were checked to evaluate his fall, noted
to be elevated, cardiology consulted and recommended transfer to
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**].
Repeat head CT showed stable subdural hematoma.
The patient denies any chest pain or SOB during this
hospitalization. He notes a mild non-productive cough with some
rib discomfort when coughing. No recent fevers, chills, n/v.


Past Medical History:
CAD MI X4 - the pt states last MI was about 18 mos ago, denies
prior hx of cardiac cathetirization or stenting.
Cardiomyopathy
COPD
DJD of c-spine


Social History:
Normally lives alone, independent, but in short term rehab uses
walker. Stopped smoking and drinking 10 years ago. Has 2
daughters which are involved.

Family History:
n/a

Physical Exam:
98.2, BP 125/41, HR 68, RR 18, O2 sat 98% on 2L NC
The patient has a visible laceration on his L zygomatic bone, no
discharge.
The patient was oriented to person, place and time. The
patient's mood and affect were generally inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
no JVD. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

AP PELVIS AND TWO VIEWS LEFT HIP: There are prominent
degenerative changes within the lower lumbar spine. Sacroiliac
joints and pubic symphysis are normally aligned. The coccyx is
largely obscured due to overlying soft tissue. Femoral heads
articulate well with bilateral acetabuli. No fracture or
malalignment is identified. There are prominent vascular
calcifications.

IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment identified.

.
THREE VIEWS, LEFT ELBOW: An appropriate lateral view was
obtained. The bones appear well mineralized. A tiny ossific
density lesion overlying the distal humerus, on the lateral film
only, is likely the sequela of prior trauma. The joint spaces
are preserved. The bones are normally aligned. The surrounding
soft tissues are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No new fracture or malalignment.

.
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2117-4-1**].

HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with subdural hematoma, status post
fall; evaluate intracranial hemorrhage.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 5-mm axial tomographic sections were
obtained from the skull base through the vertex and viewed in
brain and bone window on the workstation.

FINDINGS: No prompting outside hospital study is available to
me. There is a small right frontotemporal scalp subgaleal
hematoma with no underlying skull fracture. There is an acute
contre-coup subdural hematoma layering over the left cerebral
convexity, with relatively slight mass effect and flattening of
the subjacent gyri. There is resultant very slight, perhaps
2-mm, rightward shift of the normally midline structures with no
evidence of [**Age over 90 71613**] herniation or ventricular trapping or
obstruction. The subdural hematoma measures roughly 7.5 mm in
maximal thickness (2:18). No other acute intracranial hemorrhage
is identified. There is symmetric slight prominence of the
bifrontal extraaxial CSF spaces, with a somewhat flattened
appearance to the subjacent gyri, which raises the possibility
of underlying chronic, thin subdural collections, perhaps
related to previous hematomas.

No skull fracture is seen elsewhere. The included portions of
the paranasal sinuses, as well as the mastoid air cells and
middle ear cavities are clear. Incidentally noted is extensive
calcification of the cavernous and supraclinoid segments of both
internal carotid arteries, as well as a solitary punctate
calcification located in a right parietovertex sulcus (2:20).
This is non-specific, but may be seen with old, healed
neurocysticercosis.

IMPRESSION:

1. Acute, perhaps superimposed on chronic, left subdural
hematoma, layering over the cerebral convexity. There is only
minimal mass effect and shift of the midline structures, with no
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 71613**] herniation.

2. No other acute intracranial hemorrhage.

3. Right frontotemporal scalp hematoma with no underlying skull
fracture.

4. Possible evidence of old, healed neurocysticercosis.

COMMENT: These findings (as well as a CD with images of outside
hospital CT cervical spine) were reviewed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
Emergency Department, at the time of this dictation.
.
Repeat head CT:
FINDINGS: The evolving left convexity subdural hematoma is less
dense than on the prior study and slightly smaller with a
maximum diameter of 6.5 mm. No new hyperdense component. As
mentioned previously, there are more chronic appearing subdural
collections likely hematomas in the bifrontal and right
convexity, which are unchanged. The acute on chronic left
convexity subdural continues to exert some mass effect on the
adjacent parenchyma without definite shift of midline
structures. No new acute hemorrhage is appreciated.

IMPRESSION: Left convexity acute on chronic subdural hematoma
appears slightly less prominent. No other short interval change.

EKG with STE in V1-V4 (appears somewhat chronic)
.
Eccho: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed with
anteroseptal/anterior
akinesis/hypokinesis, anteroalteral hypokinesis and
inferior/inferolateral
