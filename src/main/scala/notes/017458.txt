Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
57 y/o f with h/o dyemyelinating syndrome, restrictive lung
defect [FVC 52%], asthma and recurrent aspiration pneumonias
requiring intubations in past who presented to ED on [**7-8**] with
hypoxia and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress.
.
Patient presented with increased cough, feeling unwell and SOB x
2-3d. She complained of SOB at rest, which is not usual for her.
SHe claimed that her sputum is yellowish with no blood. DEnies
fever/chills, did claim that her friend was [**Name2 (NI) **] with
"pneumonia". SHe claimed that she had been using increasing
frequency of albuterol at home. SHe went for her scheduled
pulmonary clinic on day of admission and was found to be
hypoxemic 82-85% on RA. She was unable to effectively cough up
secretions. Patient was placed on 6L with sats in mid-90s. CT
scan on [**7-8**] shows resolution of the total collapse of the right
middle lobe and mucoid impaction of [**Month/Year (2) 25730**], and [**Month/Year (2) 25730**] consolidation.
.
In ED, initial VS were T 99.2 P79 BP154/66 R14-16 1005 NRB.
Patient received solumedrol 125mg x1 and combivent. guiac
negative in ED. She was placed on continuos nebs with
improvement in O2 sat. However, she would desat to 80s when that
was discontinued. Repeat CTA show interval development of mild
RML collapse, no PE/aortic dissection.
.
Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and was started on steroids,
nebs, chest PT and was initiated on levofloxacin and tiotropium.
 Patient also noted to have persistently low BP, though close to
baseline, though thought the be [**1-17**] sedation.  Patient remained
stable with improving oxygenation and was transferred to the
floor on [**7-11**].

Patient currently reports feeling well, and her breathing is
much improved.  She is requesting Ativan for muscle spasms, but
otherwise is without complaints.

Past Medical History:
1.  Chronic demyelinating disease with unclear etiology,
probably
secondary to parainfectious encephalomyelitis.  The disease was
diagnosed in [**2111**] when she presented with left lower extremity
weakness following colonoscopy.  There was significant disease
progression between [**2111**] and [**2115**] and the patient became
wheelchair-bound.  She received several evaluations by
neurologists including Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 10442**] and Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 29138**] in
the early [**2109**]. MRI report from [**2111**] showed signs of
demyelination. She later underwent a sural nerve biopsy that was
negative. She was evaluated by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 915**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2523**] of
neuro-ophthalmology who found some abnormalities including
arcuate defect and RAPD suggesting possible optic nerve defect
os
at least,( possibly also od given reduced acuity and colour
acuity). Felt that it could be due to MS. VEPs were negative.
Eventually, her condition was felt to be due to parainfectious
encephalitis. Her symptoms have waxed and waned overtime. She
currently walks with Canadian crutches and is no longer
wheelchair bound. She suffers from a hypotonic bladder
requirings
self catheterizations and aspiration requiring a J tube. Her
last
neurology evaluation was by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] on [**2125-2-23**].
Unfortunately, this evaluation could not be completed. Ms. [**Known lastname 104543**]
did not return to complete the evaluation.
.
2. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Abbreviated history. in [**2114**] had
study showing mild to moderate oropharyngeal swallowing
disturbance and trace aspiration. This progressed in [**2115**]. She
had a G tube placed in [**5-/2116**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11312**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9779**] due to poor
po
intake at the Greenery. The PEG was changed to a button in
7/[**2115**]. In [**2124**], she had some time without the tube, but lost 15
pounds. In [**11/2125**] PEG changed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 349**]. It was changed
again by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] in [**2126-2-13**]. She has also had J tubes in
the
past, but did not tolerate them. She also declined to stay home
that was necessitated by the slow infusion speed of a J tube.
She
has had fistulas compromising her abdomen as well due to the
feeding tubes. She is followed now by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**].  She easts
minimal po for quality of life reasons.
.
3.  Decreased memory.
.
4.  Obstructive/restrictive lung disease, for which she has had
multiple hospitalizations, requiring stress dose of steroids.
She
had open lung bx in [**2112**] that was negative. Work up for
aspergillosis negative as well. PFTs done in [**8-/2124**] showed
reduced FVC, IC, ERV with low normal TLC and normal FRC
suggestive of restrictive neuromuscular process. She was
formerly
followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] as an
inpatient and will be seeing him as an outpatient. He has
recommended repeat sleep study for her. In the meantime,
receiving asthma inhaler regimen.
.
5. Left Renal artery Thrombus: Dx in [**2123**] when wbc elevated and
abdominal pain. Was on coumadin, c/b right femoral bleed in
[**2123**].
Risk felt to be too excessive and warfarin d/c&#8217;d.
Maintained on
ASA and folic acid for hyperhomocysteinemia. Exact cause of clot
not clear. protein C, lupus anticoagulant, and antithrombin III
were all normal. Seen in hematology [**12-20**].
.
6. Possible adrenal insufficiency: unlikely chronic problem.
Possible due to recurrent steroid use. Seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
evaluation.
.
7. s/p appendectomy
.
8. s/p ccy: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2896**]. S/p ex lap for unexplained abd pain.

shallow pre pyloric ulcers. H pylori negative.
.
10. Dilated panc ducts seen on RUQ U/S and CTA. ERCP by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in 9/[**2122**]. s/p sphincterotomy.
.
11. Osteoporosis: dx [**2121**]. T score hip and spine about
&#8211;3.4. IV pamidronate, changing to IV Boniva soon.
.
12. Hypothyroidism
.
13. pulmonary nodules. [**2122**]. Stable over time.
.
14. Hypotension: likely due to autonomic neuropathy. On
florinef.

.
16. Left Breast papilloma: had nipple discharge. Excised by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**11/2119**] c/b infection treated with keflex.
.
17. Muscle Spams: intermittent. Come at with suggestion.
Psychogenic component.
.
18. Right IJ thrombus: after line placement there. Resolved in
[**2113**].
.
19. Acquired IgG deficiency, diagnosed in [**2111**] at [**Hospital1 336**].  The
patient received IgG treatment in the past from [**2109**] to [**2113**]. No
improvement in asthma symptoms, so it was d/c&#8217;d.
.
20. Colonic polyps. Hyperplastic in [**2111**]. Others since. Due
colonoscopy in [**2128**].
.
21. Urethral carbuncle: s/p incision and removal Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**]
