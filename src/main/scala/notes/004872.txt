which was bilious.  The patient denied fevers, chills,
rigors.  He states that he was never distended.  He now
stated at [**Hospital1 18**] that in the process of being transferred he
has had five loose bowel movements.  He states that he is
passing minimal gas.  He also now states that he is now no
longer in pain.  His G tube had been discontinued in
rehabilitation on [**2165-4-20**].  After discharge, it was noted
that cultures grew out MRSA.  The patient is also recovering
from pneumonia two weeks ago and was admitted on [**2165-4-8**] for
a Crohn's flare.

LABORATORY DATA AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  The patient had a
white count of 8.9.  The electrolytes were normal.  The LFTs
were normal.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.8, heart
rate 60, blood pressure 130/80, respiratory rate 16,
saturating 88% on room air.  HEENT:  No jaundice.  Throat
scar.  Chest:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation.  Abdomen:  G tube site with some discharge,
some erythema.  The abdomen was not focally tender to
palpation.  No rebound.  No rigidity.  Appendectomy and
midline scars were seen.  Rectal:  Hemoccult negative.  No
stool.  Extremities:  Pulses palpated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and made n.p.o.,
placed on Cipro and vancomycin.  At that time, he was
transferred to the floor.  TPN was continued in the hospital.

The patient was seen by GI who agreed that the patient was
suffering from a high-grade obstruction, likely Crohn's
associated.

Shortly after the patient's admission, he was transferred to
the medical service, at which time a CT was performed showing
right base collapse and consolidation of the right and left
lungs.  The patient was treated with levofloxacin for
pneumonia.

The patient developed an abdominal abscess.  On [**2165-5-1**], the
patient was taken to the Operating Room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
where an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions,
ileocolic resection and ileocolostomy were performed.  The
patient afterwards was transferred to the ICU.

At the operation, a suspected perforation was the indication.
A large colonic phlegmon was noted.  A gastrocutaneous
fistula was also found which was corrected.  Over the course
of the patient's stay in the ICU, the patient continued to
have declining health.  His respiratory status continued to
become increasingly compromised.

On [**2165-5-19**], the patient's 02 saturation dropped and he was
in need of increased ventilatory support.  The patient
essentially expired that day.
