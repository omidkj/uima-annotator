Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
cough and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of possible IPF diagnosed in [**2112**],
on 2L home oxygen for seven years who is admitted with
progressive shortness of breath after failing outpatient
treatment for pneumonia. The patient was in his USOF until about
2 weeeks prior to admission. The patient was seen urgently in
the clinic for evaluation on [**2118-10-5**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 715**] for
right-sided chest pain and CXR done at that time revealed
bilateral lower lobe opacities that could represent pneumonia as
well as diffuse lung disease with peripheral and basilar
distribution associated with honeycombing and punctate pulmonary
calcifications suggestive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He
was started on Levaquin 500 mg p.o. daily. He returned to clinic
[**2118-10-10**] with general malaise, brown sputum, as well as fever to
100.8. At that time his Levaquin was increased to 750 mg po
daily. Five days prior to the current admission Flagyl was also
added per his [**Month/Day/Year 3390**]. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had been on prednisone taper from 40 mg
times three days, 30 mg times three days and then 20 mg which is
his baseline dose. The patient had a routine appoitment with his
[**Name10 (NameIs) 3390**] on the day of admission, who referred him to ED because of
persistent symptoms and slow decline.
.
In addition to above symptoms, he also endorses occasional night
sweats. No drenching sweats. Over the last month the patient
reports SOB with walking only a few feet which is worsening from
his baseline. He denies chest pain, palpitations, PND,
orthopnea, diarrhea. He does have contipation and occasional
lower extremity swelling. No weight loss.
.
On arrival to ED vital signs were AF, HR 100, 88/40, RR 20, 82%
on 2L then was placed on 12L NRB with improvement in O2 sats.
ABG
ABG 7.45/28/127. CXR showed new focal opacity in the righ lung
apex.
In the ED, the patient given Vancomycin 1 gm IV once, Zosyn 4.5
gm IV once, Solumedrol 125 IV once, ASA 325 once, Combivent,
Lasix 10 mg IV once. He then maintained O2 sats in mid 90's on
4L of NC.


Past Medical History:
1. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, diagnosed in [**2112**] after
hospitalization for pneumonia. On home oxygen and chronic
prednisone. Previously followed by a pulmonologist in Buffalo.
The patient was recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and according to
the patient, was told that the diagnosis of IPF is incorrect.
p-ANCa borderline positive and ACE negative.
- PFTs [**9-/2118**]: FVC 2.79 (81%) FEV1 2.1(108%) FEV1/FVC 78 (133%)

2. Hypertension
3. Colonic polyps
4. Basal cell carcinoma
5. Rectal cyst
6. S/p [**Year (4 digits) 4448**] ([**2110-4-1**]) for syncope and complete heart
block
7. S/p TURP x 3 - patient self-catheterizes [**Hospital1 **] at home
8. Spinal stenosis
9. Degenerative arthritis
10. Hearing loss
11. An outside echo from [**2118-3-1**] showed ejection fraction of
45-50% with pulmonary arterial hypertension, TR gradient to 64
mmHg.

Social History:
He recently moved from Buffalo, [**State 531**] to [**Location (un) **],
[**State 350**] where he lives with his son, [**Name (NI) **], [**Name (NI) **] smoked

pneumonia and associated apparent superinfection of adjacent
right apical bulla. Continued radiographic followup is
recommended to ensure complete resolution.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with h/o possible idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
on chronic prednisone admitted with progression of DOE, low
grade fevers and change in sputum color after failing outpatient
empiric therapy for PNA.
.
1. Shortness of breath. Most likely due to an acute infectious
process superimposed on his underlying interstitial lung
disease. The differential for this patient on chronic prednisone
was
