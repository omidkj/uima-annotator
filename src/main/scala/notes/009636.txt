Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for possible tracheostomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG and tracheostomy placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old woman with morbid obesity, obesity
hypoventilation syndrome, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and
diastolic heart failure who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for
tracheostomy placement. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2-2**]
with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear
etiology. She was admitted to the ICU for non-invasive
ventilation, which she could not tolerate; she was subsequently
intubated. She was substantially diuresed (~13 kg) with 100mg
[**Hospital1 **] Diamox. MRSA was found on sputum culture (but no white count
and no fever), and vancomycin was started (now day #5).
Piperacillin-tazobactam was added on the day of transfer. Her
vent settings at the time of transfer were SIMV 500 x 10, FiO2
0.4, PEEP 5.
.
The day prior to transfer, she developed a low-grade temperature
to 99.3 axillary with systolic blood pressures in the 80's. Her
beta blocker and calcium channel blocker (which she is on
because of atrial fibrillation with RVR) were discontinued, and
her rhythm converted into atrial fibrillation with RVR. She was
given 2 liters of IVF with improvement of her blood pressure to
the 110's, she was loaded with digoxin, and her beta blocker was
restarted (at a lower dose) on the day of transfer. Of note, her
sugars have been difficult to manage, so she was placed on an
insulin gtt.

Of note, she was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an
admission for digoxin overdose, atrial fibrillation with RVR,
and UTI treated with 10 day course of levofloxacin.

Past Medical History:
1. Morbid obesity.
2. Lymphedema.
3. Diabetes.
4. Mechanical aortic valve in [**2165**].
5. Atrial fibrillation.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. History of decubitus ulcers.
8. Ankle fracture, status post fall in [**2177-9-25**] with long
rehabilitation.
9. Recent dig toxicity admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].
10. History of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF greater
than 55%
with mild LVH, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of greater
than 18, 1+ MR).

Social History:
Lives at home with partner (health care proxy). Mostly [**Hospital1 **],
but can walk with assistance. Has nursing assistance 12 hours
daily. Denies alcohol, tobacco, other drugs. She was recently
discharged to [**Hospital6 **] after a stay at [**Hospital1 771**] for dig toxicity. She was discharged on
[**2180-1-31**]. She is mostly bed bound. She is dependent on
others for her activities of daily living. Prior to admission to
[**Location (un) 86**], she was living at home with her partner x 30 years who
is also her health care proxy.

Family History:
2 brothers had [**Name (NI) 5290**] age 59, 66. Mother and brother with
emphysema, both smokers.

CXR: This is compared with prior study from [**2180-2-14**].
There is some blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive
of a small effusion.  The cardiac size is somewhat enlarged.
The right PICC line has been removed. There has been a median
sternotomy with cerclage wires intact.  Large cardiac silhouette
with left-sided effusion, similar to
prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
70yF with atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement,
admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory failure requiring
ventilation, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tracheostomy
placement.
.
#) Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure. This was thought to
be secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome with components
of CHF and possibly pneumonia. She had completed a course of
vancomycin at the OSH for MRSA in the sputum so her antibiotics
were stopped on admission and she remained afebrile.  She was
sent for a trach after her INR trended down to <1.5 and
tolerated this without difficulty.  Her sedation was weaned and
she tolerated a switch from AC ventilation to PS 15/10 FiO2 40%
TV ~500.  She was oxygenating and ventillating well on these
settings and was transfered to pulmonary rehab for further
weaning off the vent.  She was contined on nebs throughout her
admission.
.
#) Hypotension. She was initially hypotensive in the setting of
aggressive diuresis.  She remained afebrile and did not require
pressor support.  Her BP remained well controlled even with rate
control of her afib.
.
#) Atrial fibrillation. She was in poorly controlled atrial
fibrillation on admission and was intially treated with digoxin
given her borderline blood pressure.  As this improved with
hydration her home nodal agents were gradually reintroduced
(diltiazem and metoprolol).  She was rate controlled in the 70s
at the time of discharge.
.
#) Diabetes. She was intially managed with an insulin drip but
transitioned to long acting and sliding scale insulin prior to
discharge.  Her long acting insulin will need to be readjusted
in the future as needed.
.
#) Mechanical aortic valve. She was initally placed on a heparin
drip and her INR allowed to trend downwards for her trach/PEG.
After the procedure her heparin was restarted and she was
bridged to a therapeutic INR on coumadin.  Her INR was 2.0 on
the day of discharge and the heparin was stopped.  She should
have her coumadin titrated to maintain her INR between [**2-27**].
.
#) Hypothyroidism.  We continued levothyroxine.
.
#) Depression. We continued escitalopram.
.
#) F/E/N. She had a PEG tube placed and she was started on
Replete tube feeds at 60ml/hr continuously prior to discharge
which she tolerated well.
