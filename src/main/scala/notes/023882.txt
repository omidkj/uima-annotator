Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal to borderline -hyperdynamic (LVEF >70%). There is a mild
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output and increased
stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate
([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Increased transaortic velocity secondary to
high output and increased stroke volume, not aortic stenosis.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.


Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2133-1-15**], the left ventricular systolic function
is now borderline hyperdynamic. The severity of aortic
regurgitation has increased minimally. The transaortic valvular
velocity was not previously commented upon.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2140-2-10**] 5:00 PM
FINDINGS: There are low lung volumes when compared with prior
and increasing bibasilar opacities. The heart size is top
normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. There is
indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, increased compared
with prior. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Lower lung volumes with indistinct pulmonary
vasculature consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2-12**]-
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant change as to the massive bilateral diffuse parenchymal
opacities, right more than left. No opacities have newly
occurred. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No larger
pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2140-2-10**]  5:07:14 PM
Sinus rhythm with first degree atrio-ventricular conduction
delay. Left axis deviation. Left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-1-1**] heart rate is
slower. Otherwise, multiple abnormalities as previously noted
persist without major change.
