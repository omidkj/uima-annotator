HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old
male with a history of dementia, hypertension, thoracic
aortic aneurysm who was admitted on the 7th from his nursing
home with septic shock and biliary sepsis.  The patient was
started on the MUST protocol and admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit.

The patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric
coverage of biliary organisms.  A CT scan on admission showed
a distended gallbladder filled with large stones and sludge.
There was a small amount of pericolic fluid.  The common bile
duct was dilated up to 1.4 cm.  There were no definite common
bile duct stones identified.  There was minimal stranding
around the head of the pancreas with no peripancreatic fluid
collection.  In addition, a thoracic aortic aneurysm was
noted to be 6.9 cm in its greatest diameter and there was a
left internal iliac aneurysm which was 3.4 x 4.6 cm.  On [**5-22**] the patient was intubated for increasing metabolic and
respiratory acidosis with respiratory distress.  The patient
was diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis and enterococcal
sepsis.  The patient was started on Neo-Synephrine for
hypotension which was quickly weaned off.  The patient
underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
on [**5-22**] with placement of a biliary stent.  The endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed multiple erosions
and ulcers in the stomach.  There was a single nonbleeding
diverticulum with small opening in the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful with a
sphincterotome and contrast medium was injected resulting in
complete opacification.  Multiple filling defects were seen
in the common bile duct.  The proximal cystic duct filled
with contrast but the gallbladder was not visualized.  There
was no dilatation of the intrahepatic duct.  A 10 x 10
biliary stent was placed successfully in the common bile duct
and purulent bile exuded from the duct.  Repeat right upper
quadrant ultrasound showed no evidence for cholecystitis and
therefore no percutaneous drain was placed.  During the
patient's Intensive Care Unit course he developed atrial
fibrillation which resolved.  The patient was started on
total parenteral nutrition on [**5-24**].  The Intensive Care
Unit course was also complicated by acute renal failure with
an admission creatinine of 3.3 which had improved to the
patient's baseline of 0.9 by transfer to the floor.  A
peripherally inserted central catheter was placed on [**5-24**].
The patient's course was further complicated by congestive
heart failure and significant peripheral edema thought to be
due to fluid overload as the patient had received 20 liters
of fluid by the middle of his Intensive Care Unit stay.  The
patient was therefore diuresed aggressively and by the time
he was transferred to the floor was thought to be euvolemic.
The patient's blood cultures grew out enterococcus which was
pansensitive.  Therefore, his antibiotics were changed to
ampicillin [**5-26**].  On [**5-27**] the patient developed
increasing sputum production and a decreased O2 saturation.
The sputum was sent and came back with rare coagulase
positive staph.  Repeat cultures were negative.  Therefore,
the patient's antibiotic regimen was not changed.  The
patient remained afebrile.  The patient was started on tube
feeds.  The patient was extubated on [**2145-5-31**] to room
air.  No further blood cultures were positive.  The while
blood cell count resolved.  The liver function tests were
coming down.  The patient was not requiring any oxygen.  The
patient was transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **] in stable
condition on [**5-31**].

1. Enterococcal sepsis:  The patient has had repeat blood
   cultures which were negative for any growth.  He is
   receiving 14 days of ampicillin and is currently on day
   12.  His blood pressure has been stable though somewhat
   low.  His white blood cell count has normalized.  He is
   afebrile.

1. Cholangitis and gallstone pancreatitis:  Patient is being
   treated with ampicillin for a 14 day course.  He is status
   post biliary stent placed via endoscopic retrograde
   cholangiopancreatography.  Gastrointestinal recommendation
   for cholecystectomy in one month and if the patient is not
   found to be a surgical candidate then recommend
   sphincterotomy with stent exchange.  Patient's liver
   function tests are clearly improving.
