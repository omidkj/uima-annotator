secondary to anoxic encephalopathy.  She was seen by

who had been healthy at home was found to be PEA arrest for
greater than 15 minutes before resuscitatory efforts were
begun.  She unfortunately has suffered anoxic brain injury
without hope of functional recovery.  This clinical
assessment has been made with the medical team along with
consult from neurology staff, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. The patient's  daughter was asked to make decisions
for her based upon what she would have wanted if she were
able to appreciate her current poor prognosis and little hope
for meaningful functional recovery.  Given the patient's grim
prognosis the family has made the decision for her to receive
comfort care at this time.

the unresponsiveness of Mrs. [**Known lastname 38872**] and o arrival the
