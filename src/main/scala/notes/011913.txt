Date of Birth:  [**2094-8-24**]             Sex:   F

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Dyazide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardiocentesis, right heart cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
84 yo W with hx of paroxysmal AF on Coumadin, PPM for sinus node
dysfunction, HTN, prior AAA s/p repair, aortic root dilation
(5.4 cm)& mild AI with recent admission to OSH for influenza,
found to be in AF with RVR, d/c with plans for future CV on
[**2179-1-20**], which was d/c as Pt was in sinus rhythm. Patient then
represented to OSH with fever and diarrhea on [**2179-1-22**], was
started on Levaquin & Flagyl, and underwent abdominal CT that
showed pericardial and pleural effusions. Per report, she
appeared volume overloaded and received IV lasix 20. An echo was
performed that revealed a 2cm circumferential pericardial
effusion. Given her tachycardia and hypotension she was given 5
of IV vitamin K for reversal of supratherapuetic INR in
anticipitation of tap, and transferred here for further
management.
.
On arrival to the CCU the patient was tachypneic, having
difficulty speaking more than [**1-14**] words at a time, tachycardic
to 110-120s, with low-normal blood pressures. Her pulsus was 20.
Echo findings were concerning for tamponade. She was ordered 4U
of FFP to reverse her INR and taken to the cath lab for emergent
pericardiocentesis.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema. + dyspnea
on exertion, + history of palpitations and syncope/presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Medicine Course:

# Ascending aortic aneurysm with penetrating ulcer: Confirmed on
CTA. Patient was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery and taken for
repair on [**2179-2-2**]. Prior to surgery we obtained a CTA
coronaries, which was negative for hemodynamically significant
disease. Her blood pressure was kept under strict control
(sBP<120).
.
# Constrictive Pericarditis/Exudative Pericardial Effusion: On
admission the patient had a 2 cm circumferential effusion with
tamponade physiology seen on echo. She underwent an emergent
pericardiocentesis with removal of 420 cc of fluid, determined
to be exudative in nature, likely post-viral in etiology given
her recent history of influenza. Gram stain and cultures were
negative for growth. Cytology was negative. Right heart
catheterization revealed elevated pressures consistent with a
constrictive pattern, thought to be secondary to pericarditis.
Repeat echocardiogram revealed very small effusion and the drain
was removed.
.
# AF with RVR: The patient has a history of paroxysmal AFib and
is s/p PPM for underlying node dysfunction. She presented in
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the 120s,
which she did not tolerate. Electrophysiology was consulted. The
patient underwent TEE, which was negative for clots. We then
attempted electrical cardioversion twice, both which failed at
keeping her in sinus rhythm. Her antiarrhythmic regimen was
switched from sotalol to amiodarone, and an additional attempt
at electrical cardioversion was successful. She was kept on an
amiodarone gtt, and a heparin gtt for anticoagluation, until her
cardiac surgery.
.
# Acute Diastolic CHF: TTE confirmed preserved EF of 60% and
revealed signs of RV volume overload and elevated RA pressure.
PCW on RHC was 17. CXR had evidence of pulmonary edema and
bilateral effusions, and the patient was experiencing
significant dyspnea. She was diuresed with IV Lasix boluses to
meet net negative 1 L daily. Her dyspnea and oxygen requirement
improved.
.
# Gout and Pseudogout: The patient complained of acute right
knee and ankle pain with limited range of motion. The areas were
warm and tender to palpate over the joint space. Clinical
picture was consistent with an inflammatory arthropathy;
however, given her upcoming surgery with graft placement we
elected to consult Rheumatology to tap the effusion and rule out
infection. She was given a one time dose of Prednisone. Her pain
was controlled with tylenol, tramadol, and morphine.
.
# Mild Hyponatremia: Likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from CHF,
or increased ADH secondary to pain/stress.
.
# Anemia of Chronic Inflammation: Hematocrit remained stable.
.
# Osteoporosis: Patient was continued on vitamin D and calcium
supplementation.
.
# Hypoalbuminemia: Nutrition was consulted and recommended
mealtime Ensure supplements.

Surgical Course:
Dental clearance was obtained preoperatively.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2179-2-2**] where
the patient underwent Replacement of ascending hemi arch aorta
with a 32-mm Gelweave graft under hypothermic circulatory
arrest.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring on epinephrine
and levophed drips.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Amiodarone and coumadin were
initiated for atrial fibrillation.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  She did complain of abdominal
pain.  General Surgery was consulted and CT did not reveal
obstruction.  She had several subsequent bowel movements, and
diet was advanced.  She developed a left forearm phlebitis and
was treated with Keflex.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 7, the
patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing
and pain was controlled wi
