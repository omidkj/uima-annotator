Service:  MEDICINE/[**Doctor Last Name 1181**] B

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old male
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease status post myocardial infarction, obstructive sleep
apnea, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who
presented to outside [**Hospital3 3583**] with two day history of
malaise, shortness of breath, and right leg pain. On the day of
admission to outside hospital, the patient was two weak to get
off of couch with increased shortness of breath and EMS found the
patient cool, dry and cyanotic with O2 sats at 50% on room air.
At outside hospital Emergency Department the patient received
intravenous Solu-Medrol, Zithromax, Lasix, Etomidate, Lidocaine
and Lovenox.  Initial arterial blood gas 7.13/104/88.  The
patient became hypotensive subsequently suffered PEA arrest.  The
patient was resuscitated with Dopamine, epinephrine times five,
atropine times three and started on a Levophed drip after he
was intubated.  The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.  In
the Emergency Room the patient was weaned off of the Levophed
and arterial blood gas was 7.45/36/140 on FIO2 of 100%.

Chest x-ray on admission alveolar edema, left lower lobe
infiltrate/effusion.  Electrocardiogram on admission right
bundle branch block, which is old, 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in
V1 to V4 with normalized T wave V1 to V4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory failure:  The etiology thought
to be secondary to congestive heart failure from myocardial
infarction versus questionable pneumonia versus PE with right
bundle branch block and ST elevations.  The patient was diuresed
and started on heparin for suspicion of PE.  CT on [**6-25**] was
negative for PE and heparin was discontinued.  It was suspected
that cardiac ischemia was leading to congestive heart failure
possibly secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
Bronchoscopy showed erythematous airways, mucous plugging was
suctioned from the right, BAL showed gram positive cocci in pairs
and Vanc.  Vanc was started for possible staph pneumonia along
with Levaquin and Flagyl.  The patient was extubated on [**6-28**].
On [**6-29**], the patient desatted to 78% and was thought to be
secondary to mucous plugging (the patient is on CPAP at home for
sleep apnea).  The patient continued to have a significant oxygen
requirement throughout his stay in the MICU.  The patient was
also fluid overloaded and significantly diuresed after 5 liters
of diuresis. Oxygenation subsequently improved and the patient
was weaned to O2 nasal cannula.  Vancomycin was discontinued on
[**7-4**].

On transfer to the floor the patient remained on BiPAP (15/8) for
obstructive sleep apnea and was maintained on 5 liters shovel
mask.  The patient maintained saturations between 94 to 97% on 5
liters shovel mask throughout his stay on the floor with no
further episodes of respiratory distress.

2.  Cardiac:  The patient most probably suffered an acute
myocardial infarction with troponin elevated and ST elevations on
electrocardiogram in leads V3 and V4 upon transfer to [**Hospital1 346**].  The patient was started on heparin and
beta blocker and troponins were cycled.  CKs trended downward
after admission and a non Q wave myocardial infarction was
thought to be due to demand ischemia.  In additional thought at
the time that the patient's respiratory failure was due to
congestive heart failure secondary to an myocardial infarction.
Throughout the patient's stay at the MICU the patient was
persistently tachycardic and hypertensive secondary to pain.
Cardiac consult on [**2109-7-4**] suggested concern for an left
anterior descending coronary artery occlusion since significant
electrocardiogram findings and from history. Cardiologist
recommended catheterization and continued diuresis.
Catheterization on [**2109-7-4**] showed 80% stenosis in the mid
left anterior descending coronary artery, 70% stenosis at the
second diagonal and 70% lesion in the OMI and 40% in the mid
right coronary artery.  The patient successfully underwent
stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery.  On the
last two days of MICU stay the patient had several episodes of
six beat runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, but was
asymptomatic. On arrival to the floor the patient had only one
episode of six beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
also asymptomatic.  The patient complained of chest pain once,
but was relieve with Maalox.  The patient otherwise remained
stable cardiac wise upon discharge.

3.  Renal:  The patient had increased BUN and creatinine of 67
and 2.5 on admission, which improved throughout the hospital
course and currently is 1.0.  Acute renal failure was most likely
due secondary to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of his
myocardial infarction.  At one point during MICU stay creatinine
improved to 0.4, but then trended gradually upward secondary to
diuresis.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had increased AST of 1760 and
increased ALT of 1361 on admission.  Increased transaminases were
most likely secondary to shock liver. Liver enzymes trended
downward and remained stable after transfer to the medicine
floor.

5.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient most likely has
congestive heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction.
The patient was significantly diuresed in the MICU and was
considered to be dry on arrival to the floor.  Diuretics were
held for two days and the patient was restarted on po 40 mg Lasix
dose prior to discharge.  The patient diuresed well throughout
hospital stay.

6.  Gout:  The patient had left and right hand swelling during
MICU stay thought may be secondary to gout flare.  The patient
was started on Vioxx at 50 mg for three days and then decreased
to 25 mg a day.  The patient continues to have gouty pain in his
right and left lower extremity and feet. We continued Vioxx for
several days to alleviate gouty pain. Should most likely
discontinue Vioxx one to two days after discharge.

7.  Dermitis:  The patient had swelling and erythema and
dermatitis changes consistent with his chronic dermitis.
Dermatology was consulted and recommended betamethasone times
fourteen days.  The patient still has a seven day course
remaining.

8.  Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit remained s
