Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
male with multiple medical problems including type 2 diabetes
mellitus (complicated by triopathy), congestive heart
failure, depression, chronic renal insufficiency, spinal
stenosis, and chronic low back pain who presents with
increased fatigue times several days.

The patient was recently admitted on [**3-21**] to [**3-23**]
with lethargy and a congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Per the patient's wife, the patient was improved at discharge
after two days but then developed increased lethargy,
increased ankle swelling, and slight increased shortness of
breath.  He denied any chest pain, fevers, or headaches.  He
complained of intermittent abdominal pain, but no vomiting.
He has had decreased urine output and positive constipation.
No black or bloody stools.  He has had back pain which is
chronic.  He denied any changes in medications and has been
taking his Lasix as prescribed.  The patient's weight, per
his wife, has increased from 164 pounds to 172 pounds over a
3-day period.  His wife brought him to the Emergency
Department secondary to lethargy and swelling.  Of note,  the
patient does admit to taking Ambien and pain medications
prior to sleeping.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was found to have systolic
blood pressures in the 60s.  After a 250-cc bolus, his blood
pressure increased to 90/50.  A chest x-ray was consistent
with congestive heart failure.  A dopamine drip was started.
Laboratories showed an increased creatinine of 6.4 as well a
potassium of 6.4.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**]
Intensive Care Unit for further workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic renal insufficiency (with a creatinine of 2 to 3).
2. Thrombocytopenia which has been evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
   an outpatient.
3. Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance.

   pulmonary hypertension.  An exercise treadmill test done
   in [**2136-1-1**] showed 58 percent maximum heart rate
   achieved with moderate partial reversible defect of the
   inferior wall extending to the apex, and an ejection
   fraction of 47 percent.
8. Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction
   in [**2109**] with last exercise treadmill test done as above.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN (which causes hives).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] quit
tobacco 30 years ago and denies any alcohol use as well as no
drug  use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 95.3
axillary, blood pressure was 111/45, pulse was 80,
respiratory rate was 14, and he was saturating 97 percent on
3 liters nasal cannula.  In general,  the patient was a
lethargic-appearing male lying with head of the bed
approximately 45 degrees, in no apparent distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were
small, equal and reactive.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The neck was supple
and nontender.  There was no lymphadenopathy.  Jugular venous
distention difficult to assess.  Lungs with crackles halfway
up bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a rate
and rhythm.  Normal first and second heart sounds.  There was
a [**2-4**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.  The abdomen was soft,
obese, multiple ecchymoses, flank dullness, nontender, and no
masses.  Extremities revealed 2 plus pedal edema to the knees
bilaterally with multiple excoriations.  There were venous
stasis changes.  Rectal examination revealed normal tone,
occult-blood negative.  Neurologically, lethargy, oriented
times three.  Reflexes were 1 plus throughout.  The toes were
downgoing bilaterally.  Strength was [**3-5**] in the upper and
lower extremities bilaterally.  Sensation was intact to light
touch.  Positive asterixis.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 5.9 (with a differential of 63 percent

acute changes.

A renal ultrasound showed no obstruction.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical
problems including diabetes (complicated by triopathy),
spinal stenosis with chronic low back pain, and congestive
heart failure who presents with acute-on-chronic renal
insufficiency, hypotension, and coagulopathy.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  It is still
   unclear what may have been the precipitating factor
   bringing on the patient's acute-on-chronic renal
   insufficiency.  There is some debate whether it could have
   been caused by the patient's overuse of sedatives such as
   Ambien and narcotics for his back pain and sleep
   disturbance that caused hypotension and mental status
   changes leading to hypoperfusion of the kidneys leading an
   acute insult.  It is also possible that the patient may
   have had a primary cardiac cause with a decompensated
   congestive heart failure leading to poor forward flow and
   acute-on-chronic renal failure.

The patient had a very high creatinine, acidosis, and
hyperkalemia on admission which slowly resolved during the
course of his hospital stay.  Initially, for the patient's
hypotension the patient was placed on a dopamine drip to
increase perfusion.  The patient was not dialyzed given the
fact that his INR was so high and line access could not be
obtained with such a high INR.

The patient was initially put on a dopamine drip, and this
titrated off as his urine output c
