Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased work of breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC Placement

History of Present Illness:
78 yo male with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 3696**],
Chronic aspiration, CVA, CAD, DM, Afib on coumadin presented
from rehab after routine vitals on the morning of admission
noted an oxygen saturation of 69% on RA. He was suctioned twice
with thick white secretions. He appeared to demonstrate
increased work of breathing at that time. Oxygen saturation
improved to 96% on 4L.

In the ED, initial vitals were 100.7, 104/54, 124, 35, 99 NRB.
On exam, he was noted to be minimally responsive. He was noted
to have coarse breath sounds, and appeared to have evidence of
volume overload on exam. EKG showed afib. He was given lasix 40
mg IVx1. Initial VBG showed 7.35 / 39 / 43 / 22. Bipap was
initiated and ABG showed 7.19/59/217/24. Based on worsening ABG,
patient was intubated and started on fentanyl/versed for
sedation. He received Vancomycin 1g IVx1, and Zosyn 4.5 g x1, as
well as tylenol 650 mg pr x1.  On transfer, VS were 117/59, 102,
ac 100 FiO2, 600 cc, 20, Peep 5 on fent 25 mcg.

In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable but was unresponsive to
sternal rub.

Of note, patient was admitted [**3-10**] though [**2190-3-19**] at [**Hospital1 18**] with
pneumonia. He was initially intubated and briefly on pressors,
and later extubated on [**3-11**]. Course was also complicated by
NSTEMI that was felt to be demand, and anemia requiring 4 U
PRBC. Antibiotics included Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl for planned
course through [**3-21**] for total 12 day course. On [**3-17**], patient
was retransferred to the MICU for respiratory distress that
improved with bipap and diuresis. He was transferred to the
floor and back to [**Last Name (un) 2299**] house the same day. Multiple family
meetings were help regarding code status, but HCP and son [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 42086**], and decision was made to keep patient FULL CODE at that
time until the family could come to a complete consensus.

CXR [**2190-3-20**]
SINGLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Compared to the study on [**3-19**], there is interval increase of pulmonary markings in the
right lung, compatible with interval increase of pulmonary
edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. Bibasilar
atelectasis persists. There is no pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly normal and unchanged.
Multiple median sternotomy wires are unchanged. The right
shoulder arthroplasty is unchanged. Moderate degenerative
disease is noted in the left shoulder. Abdominal drains are
partially imaged.

IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the
interval, with
small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2190-3-21**]:
FINDINGS: There are large bilateral pleural effusions, similar
when compared
to prior exam. There is no pericardial effusion. Calcifications
of the
aortic valve are noted. NG tube is identified terminating within
the stomach.
GJ-tube is also identified terminating within the proximal
jejunum. Within
the limitation of a non-contrast exam, the spleen, liver,
adrenal glands,
pancreas, and kidneys are unremarkable. Calcifications of the
splenic artery,
descending aorta and its branches are noted. Small bowel loops
are normal in
caliber and without focal wall thickening. There is no free
fluid or free
air. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no
evidence of large retroperitoneal bleed identified.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Extensive streak artifact from bilateral hip
prosthesis
limits evaluation of the pelvis. The bladder contains a Foley
catheter, with
small foci of air, likely due to recent catheterization. Large
amount of air
and fluid within the sigmoid colon and rectum are noted. The
fluid appears
hyperdense and distends the lumen of the colon. Correlation with
Hemoccult
test is recommended. There is no definite pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.
There is diffuse anasarca.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
identified.
Multilevel degenerative changes are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding.
2. Hyperdense fluid within the sigmoid colon. Correlation with
Hemoccult is
recommended to exclude blood within the colon. Alternately, this
may
represent oral contrast. Correlation with clinical history is
recommended.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions, similar when compare
