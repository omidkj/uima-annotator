Pertinent Results:
Labs:

Imaging:
CT Head [**6-13**]: 1) No evidence acute intracranial pathology.
2) Possible old neurocysticercosis infection.
.
CXR [**6-13**]: Evaluation is limited by low lung volumes and
patient's oblique positioning. There is no acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality. The lungs are clear. Blurred of the left
costophrenic angle may be due to a tiny pleural effusion. No
pneumothorax. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
within normal limits.

[**6-16**] CT abdomen
1. Multiple large mid to upper pole right renal calculi without
evidence of obstruction or secondary infection. New soft tissue
density filling defect within a right upper pole calix may
represent a noncalcified stone, however a small soft tissue
calyceal neoplasm cannot be excluded. Findings discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14440**].
2. Multiple splenic cysts, unchaned.
3. Fluid collection inferior to left rectus sheath likely
represents a postoperative seroma.
4. Subcutaneous abdominal nodule may represent a site of
injection but clinical correlation is required.
5. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:78 y/o F with obesity, chronic UTIs in the setting of
bladder diverticulum, and MMP, presented from her rehab today
with mental status changes, hypotension, and concern for
urosepsis

1. Sepsis
Likely source urine given her frequent episodes of urosepsis
over the past month.  She was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 **]
with an E.Coli, Proteus and Vanco-[**Last Name (un) 36**] Enterococcus UTI.  She
was discharged on Augmentin and Gentamicin despite E.coli not
being sensitive to augmentin nor gentamicin(although [**Last Name (un) 36**] to
cephalosporins).  Enterococcus and Proteus appeared covered.
Was intermittantly hypotensive in the ED requiring fluid
resuscitation as well as temporary levophed to maintain MAP >65.
 Was admitted to the MICU and was stable off pressors in the
first 48 hours.  She was placed on Imipenem and Vancomycin to
cover her empirically.  Urology/ID was consulted in the setting
of known staghorn calculi and her recurrent urosepsis episodes.
 Patient will be discharged on ceftazadime for 2 weeks and
switched to cefuroxime for suppression per ID.  Urology wants to
do a procedure once patient finished with IV antibiotics.

2. MS changes
Improved with IVF, Abx treatment in ED per daughter.  [**Name (NI) 430**] CT
negative in ED.  Likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy that is
improving given her urosepsis.  Patient resolved by discharge.

Creat on d/c 1.3.
