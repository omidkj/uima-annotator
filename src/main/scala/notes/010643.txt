Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p ventricular fibrillation arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. chest tube placement
2. central venous line placement
3. cardiac catheterization
4. AICD and pacemaker placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 yo female who was transferred from an OSH
s/p ventricular fibrillation arrest, and fall down stairs. Per
report, she was found unresponsive at the scene in vfib.  She
was shocked, converted to vtach, then asystole, but returned to
a rhythm after a lidocane bolus.  A combitube was placed after
multiple attempts to place an ETT and she was brought to the
outside hospital, and a left chest tube was placed.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED via ground critical care, and there
was difficulty with her airway en route.  A trauma stat was
immediately initiated.

Pertinent imaging:
[**2-9**] CT Head/CSpine (OSH): no cspine fx, possible contusion in R
temporal lobe and L quadrigeminal plate. **[**Hospital1 18**] radiologist
felt these were artifact**
[**2-9**] XRay Humerus (OSH): transverse L humural mid diaphyseal fx
[**2-9**] CT A/P (OSH): small L pneumo, no solid organ injury, subq
emphysema in neck, LLL nodular density. b/l pulmonary
infiltrates w/ likely aspiration.
[**2-9**] XRay TLS Spine (OSH): negative for fx
1/19 L Humerus: (post reduction) Diaphyseal shaft fracture with
some overlapping of fragments, proximal fragment more lateral
with respect to the distal fragment. Overlying cast material is
observed.  Improving the apposition of fragments may be
desirable.
[**2-9**] CT Head: no intracranial hemorrhage
[**2-9**] XRAY: Subcutaneous air in neck. Pneumomediastinum.
Consolidation in posterior segment of right upper lobe.
Intrafissural left chest tube. Subpulmonic air on the left.
Question pneumothorax.
[**2-10**] CXR: (prelim) subpulmonic air bilat, chest tubes in place,
R CVL tip in SVC - no apical PTX.  Subcut emphysema in neck.
[**2-11**] CXR: (post-H2O seal) Continued improvement in aeration of
lung fields with small residual patchy density at RLL field.
Evidence of apical pneumothorax.  Peridiaphragmatic air
collections stable.
[**2-12**] CXR: no specific ptx. ? opacity-pleural effusion v.

[**2-13**] CXR: vascular congestion, pleural effusion
[**2-14**] CXR: area of opacification ? developing upper lobe

Cultures:

.
CXR [**2-21**]:  Comparison is made to the prior day.  A three- lead
pacemaker/AICD device is again demonstrated.  The patient has a
tracheostomy tube.  The heart is again markedly enlarged, and
there are linear bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, as
well as similar small pleural effusions.  However, no congestive
heart failure, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax is present.
.
Cardiac catheterization: Non occlusive coronary artery disease:
final report pending.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient admitted to the Trauma ICU, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Attending,
and was emergently taken to the operating room for a
tracheostomy to provide a definitive airway.
.
Airway/breathing: The patient emergently had a tracheostomy to
provide a definitive airway, as discussed above.  In the TICU,
the ventilator was weaned as tolerated. The patient had two
chest tubes placed for a left pneumothorax (first placed at OSH
did not drain well).  Second chest tube was discontinued on
[**2-14**].  The patient had daily chest x-rays during the begining of
her ICU stay. Speech and swallow was consulted on [**2-14**] regarding
a PMV.  The patient was initially unable to tolerate the
passy-muir valve. Due to increased secretions a sputum culture
was sent and positive for Klebsiella and H-flu. She was treated
with a 7 day course of Zosyn and Vancomycin. On [**2-18**] the patient
was reevaluated for passy-muir valve and tolerated this well.
She was increasingly more alert and able to clear secretions
with less and less frequent suctioning. She used the passy-muir
valve for the majority of the remainder of her time in the
hospital. She was followed by respiratory therapy who felt that
she would potentially be ready in the [**Last Name (un) **] future for
decannulation of her trach if she continues to improve. The
patient also has a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
trauma surgery after discharge.
.
Hypotension: A triple lumen was placed in the left subclavian on
[**2-10**] for central access.  She was initally started on
neosynephrine, and transitioned to levophed.  Pressors were
discontinued on [**2-12**]. She did not require pressors for the
remainder of her stay but did have a brief episode of
hypotension on [**2-19**] after receiving aggressive diuresis. This
resolved with a small fluid bolus and no further intervention.
.
Pneumonia: Chest x-ray performed on [**2-14**] showed increased
opacities, suggestive of pneumonia.  Her temperature spiked to
101.3 F, and she was found to have a white count of 13 on [**2-15**].
As above, her sputum culture grew Klebsiella and H.Flu and she
was treated with a one week course of Zosyn and Vancomycin. She
had no focal findings concerning for focal PNA on chest X-ray.
.
? Intracranial hemorrhage: Neurosurgery was consulted regarding
a possible intracranial hemorrhage seen on CT from OSH.  A
repeat CT was performed.  The neurosurgical team did not see any
sign of intracranial hemorrhage, or any suggestion for need for
neurosurgical management.
.
Left humeral fracture: The patient sustained a transverse
midshaft humeral fracture.  This injury wanaged by orthopedics.
The humerus was reduced and splinted on HD 1.  The patient
received a brace on [**2-18**], and is scheduled to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in approx 3 weeks after discharge.
.
Cardiovascular: Cardiac enzymes were cycled. Initial troponin
was found to be 0.07, which trended down with cycling.  Cardiac
enzymes are uninterpretable in setting of cardioversion and CPR.
 An ECHO was performed on [**2-11**] which showed a cardiomyopathy
with an EF of 15-20%.  Diuresis was started with IV lasix then
D/C'd on [**2-19**] due to hypotension thought secondary to
overdiuresis.  She underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2-20**] to
further eval for possible ischemic cardiomyopathy and she was
found to have non-obstructive coronary artery disease. On
