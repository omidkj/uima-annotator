Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Evaluation of trachea, ?granulation tissue removal vs. Y-stent
placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Y Stent Placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 yo F with a past medical history of COPD s/p
tracheostomy, chronically ventilator dependent, tracheomalacia,
CAD, GAD/depression, who recently has had some increased hypoxia
and shortness of breath, with concern for granulation tissue or
worsening tracheomalacia. She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from NH
for evaluation by Intervential Pulmonary, bronchoscopy and
consideration of Y-stent placement. Of note, she did undergo a
bronch on [**2125-12-13**] to evaluate for the possibility of both of
these etiologies which found 80% occlusion of the tracheal lumen
at the anterior wall of the trachea, without any evidence
granulation tissue at that time.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is vocalizing, and is
complaining of some left sided flank pain. Otherwise, she is
comfortable and says that her breathing feels slightly wheezy.
Denies palpitations, chest pain, dysuria.
.

EKG: NSR @ 66. Normal axis/intervals. Low voltage and poor R

evidence of ischemia. No priors for comparison
.
CT A/P: FINDINGS: The lung bases demonstrate bilateral lower
lobe atelectasis, new from the previous study. There is no
abnormality noted in the visualized heart and pericardium.
No focal hepatic lesions are identified. There is mild
intrahepatic and
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, extending to the distal
common bile
duct. There is no pancreatic ductal dilation, nor is there any
lesion/mass
identified to explain these findings. The gallbladder is not
distended,
though there is also mild prominence of the cystic duct. The
adrenal glands, spleen appear unremarkable. There is a focal
fatty replacement of the pancreatic neck with a normal
appearance of the remainder of the gland. The kidneys
demonstrate no stones in the enhance and excrete contrast
symmetrically. There is no CT evidence of pyelonephritis.
Minimal bilateral perinephric stranding is nonspecific. Loops of
small and large bowel are normal in caliber. There is an [**Doctor Last Name **]
type ventral type ventral hernia involving the distal stomach.
There are scattered colonic diverticula without diverticulitis.
There is no lymphadenopathy, free fluid, or free air. The
caliber of the abdominal aorta is normal, although it is
slightly ectatic with atherosclerotic calcifications.

CT OF THE PELVIS: The bladder contains a Foley catheter. The
rectum, uterus, and adnexa appear unremarkable. There is no
lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

In the anterior pelvic subcutaneous tissues, there is mild
stranding and foci of air compatible with an injection site.

The osseous structures demonstrate a healing fracture of the
right eleventh rib posteriorly. There are no concerning lytic or
sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pyelonephritis.
2. Biliary ductal dilation. Correlation with LFTs is
recommended.
3. Nonobstructing ventral hernia involving stomach.
.
CXR [**1-18**] - IMPRESSION: Lung volumes remain low, and large band
of atelectasis still crosses the left lower lung. Upper lungs
clear. Tracheobronchial Y stent in place. [**Month (only) 116**] be new
pneumomediastinum. No pneumothorax. No appreciable pleural
effusion. Heart size normal.
.
CT Chest [**1-18**] - Prelim read - Status post tracheal stent
placement. No evidence of pneumomediastinum

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 67 yo F with history of chronic respiratory
failure s/p trach for COPD, tracheomalacia, now with shortness
of breath, transferred from NH for evaluation by IP.

# Tracheomalacia - The patient has a history of tracheostomy and
chronic ventilatory dependence (at night) for over 1 year. She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of tracheal stenosis
versus tracheomalacia. The pt underwent bronchoscopy on [**1-14**] via
tracheostomy and was found to have severe tracheomalacia. She
then underwent rigid bronchoscopy on [**1-15**] with placement of a Y
stent.  Following the procedure the pt complained of increased
dyspnea. Repeat bronchoscopy was performed to confirm stent
placement. Her tracheostomy was found to end withing the Y
stent, bronchomalacia beyond the Y stent was seen but there was
evidence of good aeration on visualization. She was continued on
her chronic dose of prednisone and inhalers. Mucinex and
Mucomyst and normal saline nebulizers have been added. On CXR of
[**1-18**] there was question of pneumomediastinum versus
visualization of a bullae. She underwent CT Chest for further
evaluation which demonstrated no evidence of pneumomediastinum.
She was maintained on CPAP/PS b
