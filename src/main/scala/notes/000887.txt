Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Failure to decanulate

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T-tube and Y-stent placement - [**10-19**]
T-tube and Y-stent removal - [**10-26**]
Trach tube placement - [**10-26**]
Bronchoscopy
Trach change to Portex # 7 after patient pulled out trach
balloon during agitation


History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 year old male with history of COPD and CHF
presenting for failure to decanulate tracheostomy tube at rehab
with need for T-tube placement, with anatomy such that the
distal end of the T-tube will be telescoped into the Y stent. He
had a stent trial in the past which was unsuccessful due to
mucous plugging.  Two months ago he was also admitted to [**Hospital1 **] with respiratory failure and had a tracheostomy placed
at that time.  He has been at the rehab since but have failed to
decannulate him.  At baseline, he is on a 50% trach mask with
sats around 95%.  He is now being admitted for changeover of
tracheostomy to a T-tube with placement of its distal end into a
Y stent.  The procedure was accomplished this morning and he is
doing well on the floor.  He has no complaints currently.
Review of systems negative for fevers, chills, dyspnea, cough,
nausea/vomiting, dysuria.

CXR [**2172-10-22**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-19**], the tracheal
stent is in
place. Continued low lung volumes with areas of atelectasis at
the bases. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.

CXR [**2172-10-30**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-29**], there is little
overall
change. Continued low lung volumes with mild prominence of
interstitial
markings and bibasilar atelectatic changes. Tracheostomy tube
remains in
place and the midline sternal wires are intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Medicine Floor Course [**Date range (1) **]:
The patient was admitted to the medicine service afer t-tube
placement on [**2172-10-19**].  On [**2172-10-20**] he was brought back to the
OR for repositioning of the t-tube.  On [**2172-10-20**] he had
worsening of his secretions and was started on vancomycin and
levofloxacin.  Bronchial washings came back with Staph aureus
coag+, E. Coli, and stenotrophomonas  He is known to be a
colonizer with MRSA and Stenotrophomonas.  His respiratory
status progressively worsened on [**2172-10-22**] and his antibiotics
were broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Levo.  He desatted occasionally
into the 80s with coughing and excessive secretions.  He was
suctioned frequently.  He was evaluated by IP who recommended
transferring him to the ICU for closer monitoring.
.
ICU Course 11-26-12/2:
88 year old male with tracheal stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia
s/p placement of Montogmery T-tube on [**10-19**] and revision on
[**10-20**] admitted to MICU with increased secretions and hypoxia
with coughing following procedure ([**2172-10-26**]) s/p Y-stent and
T-TUBE removal, mucous plugging s/p bronchoscopy and Portex
trach tube re-insertion ([**9-29**]) after patient agitated and
pulled out balloon. Hospital course
