CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-5-28**] 12:03 AM
STUDY: Chest CTA and CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast;
MDCT images were generated through the chest without IV
contrast. Subsequent MDCT images were generated through the
chest after the administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenous
contrast in the pulmonary arterial phase. Coronal, sagittal as
well as right and left oblique reformatted images were also
generated.  Subsequent MDCT images were generated through the
abdomen and pelvis using the same contrast bolus in the venous
phase. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images of the abdomen
and pelvis were also generated.
COMPARISON: None.
FINDINGS:
CHEST: The visualized portion of the thyroid demonstrates a
hyperdense nodule at the junction of the left lobe and the
isthmus that measures 17 x 9 mm (5A; 6). There is no axillary,
hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The aorta is of normal
caliber along its course and shows no intramural hematoma or
dissection.
