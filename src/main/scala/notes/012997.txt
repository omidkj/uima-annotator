Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of hypertension, type II
diabetes, Severe Aortic Stenosis with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2,
Parkinson's, and Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] who presented from home with
chief complaint of vomiting. He awoke this am with 7 episodes of
non-biliois, non-bloody vomiting. Had some associated abdominal

CP, SOB or palpitations today.
.
In the emergency department initial vital signs were T 97.9 HR
109 BP 151/91 RR 20 O2Sat 85%. CXR showed mild-moderate
pulmonary congestion. O2 sat improved to 97% with 2L O2 via NC
and repositioning. Given concern for PNA he was given Cefepime
and Levofloxaxcin. Labs notable for mildly elevated WBC ct of
11,000 and lactate of 2.4. In addition he was seen by gen [**Doctor First Name **]
for eval of L sided inguinal hernia which was tender, but is not
new. Gen [**Doctor First Name **] did not feel this requires surgical intervention
at this time. He was transferred to the MICU for further
work-up.
.
In the ICU, he reports that nausea and vomiting have resolved.
Breathing is comfortable. Otherwise, he feels well.

CTU:
IMPRESSION:

1. Dilated loops of proximal small bowel leading to a long zone
of transition
ending within a left inguinal hernia with decompressed loops
leaving the
hernia sac which is concerning for high-grade partial versus
early complete
small bowel obstruction.

3. Pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure.

4. Moderate pericardial effusion.

5. Stable compression deformities of L1, L2 and T11.

These changes in the wet read were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
3:30pm.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


.
CXR:
Persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary congestion with possibly
tiny left pleural effusion. Essentially unchanged borderline
cardiomegaly.
No focal airspace consolidations.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-6-12**],
the aortic valve gradient is now slightly higher and left
ventricular systolic function is now slightly less vigorous.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male PMH severe AS, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], parksions, inguinal
hernia, DMII and HTN admitted for vomiting and abd pain likely
[**12-29**] to transient SBO. Pt also found to be hypoxic with O2 =85 on
RA in the ED, and CXR suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. Pt
initially admitted to MICU, however, stabilized and transferred
to the medical floor on HD#2.
.
#. Small Bowel Obstruction/VOMITING: Likely related to transient
SBO from inguinal hernia. After discussion with cardiology and
surgery, decision was made not to intervene or perform elective
hernia repair since pt would be at high surgical risk given his
underlying critical AS. He had no further episodes of vomiting
and diet was advanced to his home diet of ground solids and
thick liquids- which he tolerated well. If patient needs
emergent surgery in the future, then surgery might consider
operating on the ventral hernia, however, cardiology recommended
against any elective procedure.
.
#.Acute on chronic systolic CHF/HYPOXIA: Likely related to
chronic interstitial lung disease from asbestos exposure as well
as CHF component. CXR revealed some pulm edema. He initially
required 2L oxygen with sats in the mid-90s. After diuresis with
lasix (20-40mg/day IV lasix for 2 days), pt's sats improved to
95% on RA. He will go home on lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
#.MYASTHENIA [**Last Name (un) **]: Stable. Recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 41020**]
for an exacerbation and started on imuran.  Continued his imuran
and pyridostigmine. LFTs were checked: AST 43, ALT 15.
.
#. PARKINSON's: Continued carbidopa-levodopa.
.
#. Critical AS: Echo on this admission reveals severe/critical
AS (valve area 0.8) with worsening valve gradient and decreased
EF 70-->50%. Pt also had component of CHF [**12-29**] AS and was
diuresed. Cardiology does not think pt is surgical candidate
unless life threatening emergency. They recc pt get valve
replacement but pt declines at this time. He will follow up with
cardiology outpatient to hear his options for intervention
(percutaneous might be option for him).
.
# Diet: Initialy on clears (thickened clears) and was slowly
advanced to ground solids with thickened liquids. Pt was resumed
on his home aspiration precuation diet and tolerated it well.
