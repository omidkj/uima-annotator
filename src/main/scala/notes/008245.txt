History of Present Illness:
77 year old woman with a history of severe COPD on 2L home O2,
CHF, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin transferred from [**Hospital1 2519**] with presumed urosepsis and multiple orthopedic
injuries s/p fall.  Per history, the patient was started on
bactrim yesterday for left lower extremity cellulitis.
Yesterday afternoon, she was found down by her husband with
presumed mechanical fall without LOC.  She was brought to [**Hospital1 2519**].  At that time, the patient was able to provide an HPI.
 She stated that she hit her back and went down without head
strike or LOC.  She endorsed total body pain, R > L.  She denied
chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea.  For her fall, she
underwent CT scans of the head, C-spine, chest, abdomen and
pelvis, these were essentially benign.  Orthopedic workup that
revealed a right humeral surgical neck fracture and right
intertrochanteric hip fracture.  At [**Hospital1 **], the patient was
found to be hypotensive.  Right IJ was placed.  She did have a
lactate of 5, she received 4 L of normal saline, she was
initially started on norepinephrine.  She also received flagyl,
vancomycin and levaquin.  She underwent cardiac workup, and was
found to have an NSTEMI, with troponin > 1.  She received a full
strength ASA.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial vs: 97.8 112 71/33 20 96% 4L. EKG
showed afib with HR [**Street Address(2) 112495**] depr laterally with <1mm STE V2-3
c/w prior.  She was evaluated by atrius cardiology, who felt
that EKG looked similar to previous EKGs at [**Hospital1 **].
UA positive.  INR 4.2.  VS prior to transfer: 98.8 106 106/44 16
95%.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is unable to respond to
questions
.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain due to AMS.  Per transfer
records, patient had dirrhea prior to admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old woman with a history of CAD, CHF, and A fib on
coumadin admitted s/p fall with hypotension and multiple
orthopedic injuries:

# Hypotension:  Patient transferred from OSH with hypotension
following a fall.  She was found to be in likely septic shock,
either from a urinary or pulmonary source.  She had a grossly
positive UA on admission, but urine culture sent following
initiation of antibiotics at the OSH negative.  Chest X-ray with
increasing retrocardiac and right upper lobe opacities.  She was
repleted with fluids and started on norepinephrine for pressure
support.  Norepinephrine required rapid uptitration, and the
patient was given bicarbonate to optimize pH for pressors.
Vasopressin was then added.  She was also started on vancomycin,
cefepime, and azithromycin to cover for pulmonary and urinary
sources.  Given her cardiac history and elevated troponin, she
also underwent ECHO to evaluate cardiac or obstructive sources
for her hypotension.  She was found to have an EF of 25% with
severe TR.  Thus, obstructive physiology from a possible fat
embolism related to her hip fracture may contribute to her
hypotension.  As atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response also likely contributed to her hypotension, she was
also rate controlled as below.  No evidence of bleed from hip
fracture.  With persistent hypotension and significant
discomfort/agitation as below, the patient was made comfort
measures only at the request of her family.  Pressors were
discontinued. The patient died with profound septic shock and
hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure on [**2104-9-22**].

# Hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Patient
admitted with hypoxemia requiring non-rebreather; markedly
increased from baseline requirement of 2L for COPD.  Over the
first 2 hours of admission, she became increasingly obtunded,
and was found to have a significant respiratory acidosis with
CO2 narcosis (ABG 7.96/102/88).  She was placed on non-invasive
ventilation, given code status of DNI, with mild improvement in
hypercarbia and mental status.  She was treated with nebs, and
was taken on and off non-invasive ventilation as patient
tolerated throughout her admission.  Regarding the etiology of
respiratory failure, the patient may have had worsening
pneumonia as above.  She was covered with vancomycin, cefepime,
and azithromycin.  However, presentation also concerning for fat
emb
