Brief Hospital Course:
For his MRSA bacteremia:

a) MRSA bacteremia
He was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation of SIRS. He was started
empirically on azithro, ceftaz, vanco, flagyl. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his
blood cx from admission grew [**3-15**] MRSA, he was changed from vanco
to linezolid (for concern of VRE in urine in past) and the
flagyl was stopped. He had a TTE on [**7-21**] that did not show
obvious lesions. He was seen by surgery who felt that the port
should remain in and he should try a trial of therapy with abx.
He also had an abdominal US to evaluate his kidney transplant
which was within normal limits. He remained hypoxic (94-99% on
6L to face mask) but HD stable so was transferred to medicine
service on East [**Hospital 18**] campus.   Patient was transferred to West
[**Hospital 18**] campus on [**2203-7-25**]. He had been afebrile for four days and
hemodynamically stable.

On [**7-27**] his POC was pulled for persistent bacteremia and a Rt.
sided PICC was placed. On [**7-28**] the pt. was intubated with
sedation (propofol) for a planned MRI to evaluate back pain and
bacteremia to see if he had an epidural abscess - he could not
fit into the scanner, however, and the study could not be
completed. He subsequently underwent TEE which was negative for
evidence of endocarditis.  Given decreased renal function and
+eos, his vancomycin was changed to daptomycin on [**8-8**].

b) UTI
On [**8-9**], the patient was noted to have >100k ESBL pseudomonas,
and tobramycin/cefepime were started.  His suprapubic cath was
changed by urology.

2) For his altered mental status, ?seizure:
The patient makes stereotypical flailing/flapping motion of his
upper extremities.  The day of the TEE and attempted MRI, the
patient was becoming increasingly somnolent ([**7-28**]) (even prior
to propfol administration), and the morning of [**7-29**], MICU
evaluation was requested for agitation and altered mental
status. The patient was repeatedly cursing and saying "Mama" and
the primary team was unable to get a blood pressure, gas, labs.

He was transferred to the MICU and monitored overnight.  His
narcotic medications were all held.  The following day, he was
initially somnolent, not making his flapping movements.  After a
small dose of dilauded, the patient spontaneously woke up.   The
patient was later transferred to the floor and his methadone and
dilauded were continued.

Two days later, a trigger was called for somnolence with
difficulty arousing the patient.   A dose of narcan was
administered and the patient regained conciousness.  He
explained that he "didn't feel right" and was "burning up".
About two minutes later he became unresponsive and apneic.  A
code was called and he was intubated with a fiberoptic scope.
Ativan x6mg was given as was a dilantin 1.5gm load.

Neurology was consulted and EEG was performed.  EEG demonstrated
an irritable
focus in the right frontal region but it was not clear what ths
significance of this was.  Dilantin was used and titrated up
with severeal extra loading doses for a corrected level [**11-30**].

Following extubation on [**8-6**], the patient had good mental
status.  After chaning him from a fentanyl/versed drip, he was
transitioned to his regular narcotic regimen.  On [**8-8**], his
mental status worsened.  His narcotics were reduced to dilauded
1mg q3:prn and methadone 2.5 TID.

3) Renal failure: pt has history of renal transplant and is
maintained on azithioprine and prednisone.  His Cr baseline in
0.3-0.5 and while on vancomycin his Cr rose to 1.7 with eos in
his urine.  His vanco was d/c'd and changed to daptomycin.  His
Ck's were monitored and were stable.

4) Pain: pt was on methadone and dilauded for his pain.  This
required titration down for somnolence.

5) Access: pt had a PICC line placed after port-a-cath removal.
This was initially a double-lumen, and required changing by
interventional radiology on [**8-2**] and [**8-8**] (to a single-lumen)
because it was blocked.

6) Code Status: on [**2203-8-9**], the patient, in discussion with the
MICU team and his mother [**Name (NI) **], decided to be DNR.  He does
want to be intubated if it is for a short time, and would not
want a tracheostomy.

ICU course: Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] continued to have hypotension, resp
failure requiring intubation, worsening renal failure and
chronic infections including UTIs. Once Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] was
intubated, his family was called as his wishes were to not be
intubated for a long period of time. Discussions were held with
the family, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the hospitalist who knew
him well from CC7. The family decided to make Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3225**].
The pressors were stopped and he was extubated and passed away
within 10 minutes with his family surrounding him. Family choice
