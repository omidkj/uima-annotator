Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4421**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This 64 year old female with a history of recurrent endometrioid
adenocarcinoma with metastases to the liver and intrabominal
organs presented to the ED with 7/10 substernal chest pain and
shortness of breath.  The chest pain and shortness of breath
awoke her from sleep the night prior to admission, however in
retrospect she states that she has been having some pain and SOB
for 4 days but did not seek medical attention. The shortness of
breath and chest pain are worse with deep inspiration. The chest
pain is sharp and does not radiate to her left arm, jaw, or
back. She denies any recent calf pain/lower extremity edema. She
traveled in [**Month (only) 216**] to [**Doctor First Name 5256**] by car but otherwise denies
any recent travel.

In the ED, her vital signs were: Temp 97.5, HR 102, BP 151/63,
RR 20, Sat 94% on RA.  A CTA was performed which showed
bilateral pulmonary embolism. She was initially normotensive and
then have one episode of hypotension to about 100s. She remained
normotensive. However, given that she has bilateral PE and EKG
shows right heart strain, she was admitted to the MICU for
observation. She was started on heparin drip in the ED after a
negative head CT.

ROS:
No fevers/chills/melena/hematuria. Positive for RUQ pain that is
chronic and related to her liver metastases. Recent 20 pound
unintentional weight loss.

[**2136-11-10**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is
no significant axillary lymphadenopathy. There are few prominent
mediastinal lymph nodes. These are subcentimeter in size. There
are two lymph nodes visualized in the AP window which appear
more prominent than previously seen. The heart and aorta are
unremarkable. There are multiple filling defects within the main
pulmonary arteries bilaterally, extending into the segmental and
subsegmental branches consistent with pulmonary emboli. There
are no pleural or pericardial effusions.

The lung window images reveal no areas of consolidation or lung
nodules. The airways appear patent to the level of segmental
bronchi bilaterally. Mild right basilar atelectasis noted.

The visualized portion of the upper abdomen, the imaged portion
of the liver again demonstrates multiple areas of low
attenuation consistent with hepatic metastases. These are not
fully evaluated on this single phase-contrast study. A soft
tissue density/node is again visualized in the epicardial fat,
measuring 1.3 x 1.5 cm. This appears slightly smaller than
previously seen.

There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions in the osseous
structures.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiple reconstructions confirm the above
findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. Filling defects within right and left main pulmonary arteries
extending to the segmental and subsegmental branches consistent
with multiple pulmonary emboli.
2. Metastatic liver disease.
.
[**2136-11-10**] CT of head: FINDINGS: There is no intracranial mass
effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures
or major vascular territorial infarction. The density values of
the brain parenchyma are within normal limits. Surrounding soft
tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage. MRI with and without
gadolinium is more sensitive for picking up of brain metastases.
.

EKG [**2136-11-10**]: Sinus tachycardia at rate 101. Left anterior
fascicular block. T wave inversions in leads V1-V3 with flat T
waves in lead V4, cannot exclude ischemia. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2135-7-7**] atrial tachycardia and T wave changes
are new. Left ventricular hypertrophy voltage is absent.
.
EKG [**2136-11-11**]: Sinus tachycardia at rate 106. Left anterior
fascicular block. Non-specific low amplitude T waves. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2136-11-10**] the T waves are now upright
in leads V2-V3.
.
EKG [**2136-11-12**]: Sinus tachycardia. Left anterior fascicular block.
Poor R wave progression could be due to left anterior fascicular
block. Non-specific T wave flattening. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2136-11-11**] no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 64 year old female with a history of recurrent,
metastatic uterine cancer who presents with SOB and chest pain,
found to have bilateral PEs on chest CT.

1. Bilateral PE-  She was started on heparin drip in the ED
after a negative head CT.  Given that she has bilateral PE and
EKG shows right heart strain, she was admitted to the MICU for
observation.  The patient was hemodynamically stable and then
transferred the next day to the OMED service.  The heparin drip
was switched to Lovenox for long term use.  The patient's O2
saturation improved with anticoagulant treatment; at the time of
discharge, the patient was saturating in the 95-96% range at
rest, and 92% during ambulation on room air.  However, given
subjective dyspnea and improvement in symptoms with O2, the
patient was sent home with O2 supplementation.

2. Metastatic uterine cancer- Further chemo treatment per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. The patient has known mets to
