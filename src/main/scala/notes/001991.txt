CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2165-10-8**] 3:44 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: pneumothorax

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old man s/p CABGx3, MV repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pneumothorax
PA AND LATERAL CHEST

HISTORY: Status post CABG. Mitral valve repair. Prior
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**10-4**] and 7:

Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased and bibasilar
atelectasis has substantially improved, with a greater residual
on the left. Upper lungs clear aside from borderline vascular
redistribution. The postoperative enlargement of
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No pneumothorax.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications.

Conclusions:
Prebypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction with LVEF 45=55%.. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities
include mid anterior and inferior walls. Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral annular ring appears
well seated and
is not obstructing flow. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. The posterior leaflet
is mildly
restricted. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post Bypass. Global biventricular function is as prebypass. The
mitral annular
ring appears well seated and is not obstructing flow. There is
no mitral
regurgitation. There is no observed obstruction to flow in the
LVOT. No new
aortic or valvular abnormalities are observed.
[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 31182**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
for a cardiac catheterization [**2165-9-30**] that revealed an LMCA of
30%, LAD of 70%, and 90% Lcx.  A pre-operative echocardiogram
revealed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
On [**2165-10-2**] he was brought to the operating room and underwent a
CABGx3/MV repair please see operative report for further
details.  He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in
stable condition to the CSRU. He continued to do well and was
weaned from sedation and extubated. He continued to do well
hemodynamicly and was weaned off all pressors.  On postoperative
day 1 was continued to do well and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2.
On postoperative day 2 he developed atrial fibrillation that was
treated with beta blockers and amiodarone.  He continued to have
short burst of Afib requiring adjustment of beta blocker.  He
was diuresed and anticoagulation was started for atrial
fibrillation.  He continued to progress and postoperative day 6
he was ready for discharge.  He is in normal sinus rhythm with
Atrial fibrillation rate controlled.  Will continue with
physical therapy at rehab. Plan for INR to be checked at rehab
on [**10-11**].
