History of Present Illness:
53 yo [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2189-12-4**] from NH for
symptomatic hypercalcemia and acute renal failure. Upon
admission, patient reported [**2-12**] day period of weakness with loss
appetite. Night sweats X9 months. No pain/fever/pruritus/abd
pain/constipation/diarrhea.

In the ED, Ca was 14.9, with Phos 5.5 and creat 3.3. Received NS
with Lasix and calcitonin in the ED.  Patient with improvement
of serum calcium with fluids and lasix, and decrease in in Cr to
2.1 over first 2 days in the the hospital. Patient then spiked
fever to 103, assoicated with cough.  CXR without clear
infiltrate. Patient subsequently started on azithromycin for
presumed bronchitis.

On [**12-5**] patient received small dose of ativan for anxiety. That
evening, she became lethargic with increased respiratory rate
and decreased O2 sats to the 80s. CT head at this time was
negative for acute process and ABG showed marked acute
respiratory acidosis (7.24/104/58).  Nasal BiPap was attempted
without improvement, and patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
full mask PPV, but was subsequently intubated given persistent
decreased mental status. Patient was continued on azithomycin
and was started on solumedrol . CXR without evidence of new
infiltrate. After improvement of mental status, patient was
successfully extubated on [**12-9**], and transferred to the floor
this evening. She was transitioned from Solumedrol to prednisone
taper.

Hospital course also notable for:
1)Improved hypercalcemia with fluids and lasix; SPEP/UPEP
negative. PTH wnl; Phos elevated. ACE Pending. Awaiting
diagnostic procedure.
2)Continued renal insufficiency without evidence of
nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis on ultrasound, random urine
negative for eosinophils and FeNa >1%. Urine calcium not
measured over 24 hours. SPEP and UPEP negative.
3)Anemia with Fe/TIBC <15%, with stable hematocrit.

Upon transfer to floor, patient reports feeling at her baseline
respiratory status. She denies any fevers, chills, chest pain,
abdnominal pain or skin lesions. She reports that she has had
dry and red eyes ever since she began not feeling well. She
denies any vision changes.

Past Medical History:
1.  Asthma, s/p multiple hospitalizations and intubations. Now

3.  Diastolic congestive heart failure with mild (+1)mitral
regurgitation ([**9-11**]).
4.  History of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (MAT)
5.  Diabetes mellitus.

minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol and was stopped for fatigue. Very

Radiology:

[**12-4**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS:  Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy is noted, with the
largest node located on the left measuring 1.6 cm in greatest
short axis dimension. Mediastinal and bilateral bulky hilar
lymphadenopathy is also appreciated. Patchy pleural thickening
is noted bilaterally.  There are wedge-shaped areas of
consolidation in two separate locations within the right lung,
the features of which likely represent either scarring or
atelectasis.  Given their distribution, infection is less
likely.  Small cystic air spaces are present at the lung apices.
 No discrete nodules are seen.
Limited imaging of the upper abdomen demonstrates a large,
lamellated
calcified gallstone which may be within the gallbladder neck.  A
small
retrocrural and periportal lymph nodes are also present.

BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony
lesions.

IMPRESSION
1.  Axillary, hilar, and mediastinal bilateral lymphadenopathy.
The
distribution is more suggestive of a systemic process such as
sarcoid or
atypical infection, with lung cancer being much less likely.
2.  Cholelithiasis.

[**12-7**] CXR: b/l perihilar haziness with upper zone redistribution
with upper zone predominence; b/l hilar enlargement; b/l pleural
effusions

[**12-9**] Renal U/S: IMPRESSION:
Intrinsic renal disease.  No nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 53 yo AAF with h/o severe asthma, OSA, diastolic
dysfunction, TB s/p INH therapy, admitted with hypercalcemia,
hyperphosphatemia, ARF, anemia, and hilar, medicastinal and
axillary LAD with hospital course c/b acute hypercarbic
respiratory failure s/p extubation at baseline respiratory
status, with improved Ca, persistent renal insufficiency and
anemia.  This is a brief hospital course by problem:

1)Hypercalcemia with normal PTH: diff Dx includes malignancy,
granulomatous diseases, namely sarcoid, intake of Vit D and
calcium, although less likely. ACE slightly elevated at 74. Vit
D levels and
