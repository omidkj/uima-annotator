Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
brain mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-11-1**]: Right Craniotomy and resection of mass


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69yo woman with history of metastatic small cell
carcinoma of the lung, diagnosed in [**5-/2119**] and non-operable
abdominal mets s/p palliative chemo and radiation. She went to
[**State 1727**] for the weekend on [**2120-10-14**], but by [**2120-10-16**], she was feeling hot and vomiting and had unsteady gait;
her husband had difficulty waking her up; her temperature was
102.  She was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**State 1727**] for febrile
neutropenia and changes in mental status; she was treated with
cefepime.  MRI of the head on [**2120-10-16**], showed a 2.8 x
2.8 x 3.1 cm solitary mass in the right frontal lobe with rim
enhancement and with an irregular wall and with apparent cystic
or necrotic center; there was mild-to-moderate edema and mild
mass effect on the right
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]; there was regional overlying dural enhancement;
there were no other lesions in the brain.

The patient was referred to Neurosurgery and the risks and
benefits of undergoing surgical resection were discussed with
the patient. She has decided to proceed with resection and now
electively presents.

Past Medical History:
Oncologic past medical history:
- small cell carcinoma of lung primary s/p chemo and radiation
- Large R abdominal mass causing T12-L3 neurologic symptoms
currently on palliative chemotherapy with taxol and recent
initiation of radiation to the abdominal mass.
- HTN
- Anxiety
- COPD
- GERD


Social History:
Married, lives with husband, retired from State Department
processing tax forms.  Continues to smoke [**1-15**] pack per day.  No
etoh or illicits.


Family History:
No known fhx of lung cancer

Physical Exam:
upon discharge:
alert and oriented x 3, grossly full motor in all 4, incision
well healing

Pertinent Results:
[**11-1**] MRI Brain: IMPRESSION:  Right frontal lobe lesion is
stable to slightly increased in size since [**2120-10-16**].

[**11-1**] NCHCT: IMPRESSION:  Status post resection of a right
frontal lobe mass with expected postsurgical changes.  No large
intracranial hematoma. No evidence of an acute major vascular
territorial infarction.

[**11-2**] Brain MRI: Postoperative study with presence of blood
products in the operative cavity which limits evaluation for
residual neoplasm, although no definite neoplasm is identified
at this time.  Recommend followup imaging after resolution of
acute postoperative changes.

[**11-2**] CXR: Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
stable given the patient rotation on the current examination.
The lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal
airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia or aspiration.
There is a small layering right effusion.  The pulmonary
vasculature is slightly less well defined and likely reflects
interval development of mild interstitial edema.  No
pneumothorax.

[**11-3**] CXR: FINDINGS:  Right PICC terminates in the lower
superior vena cava.  Small to moderate, apparently partially
loculated right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size
from the prior radiograph.  Otherwise, no relevant changes since
the recent study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt electively presented and underwent a craniotomy and resection
of mass. Surgery was without complication. She was extubated and
transferred to the ICU. Post op Head CT revealed post operative
changes without hemorrhage or evidence of stroke. She was
confused but followed commands and MAE's. She remained stable
overnight and on [**11-2**]. Routine post op MRI revealed good
resection. She was started on SQH for DVT prophylaxsis.
On [**11-3**] she continued to be confused but was stable so she was
cleared for transfer to the floor. A slow decadron wean was
initiated. She lost peripheral IV access, and due to her need
for constant IV access (inpt and outpt) a PICC line was placed.
In the evening her telemetry was showing a sustained HR in the
150's. She was given 5mg of Lopressor. Her HR came down to 130's
but SBP was in the 90's so she wasn't given another dose. EKG
revealed SVT, Labs were stable. She was given an IVF bolus and
her HR returned to the 80's with a SBP in the 120's. She
remained neurologically stable throughout this episode.
On [**11-4**] speech and swallow were consulted for a safety
evaluation. PT and OT were consulted for assistance with
discharge planning who found her appropriate for discharge to
home with services.
