REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 55% to 60% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Aneurysmal
interatrial
septum. Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at
rest. Large
secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**11-19**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. No TEE related
complications. The
patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally
reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass
data The
post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving
vasoactive
infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. A left-to-right shunt
across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A large secundum atrial
septal defect is
present.
3. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%).
4. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular
systolic function is normal.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive
infusions including phenylephrine.
1. Prior ASD has been repaired. A very small residual left to
right shunt is
noted even after protamine.
2. LV function is preserved
3. RV function is moderately hypokinetic with subsequent
improvement
4. TR is unchanged
5. Other findings are unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**8-11**] and underwent cardiac cath prior to surgery.
Underwent surgery with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**8-12**]. Transferred to the
CSRU in stable condition on phenylephrine and propofol drips.

begin increasing her activity level. Chest tube removed without
incident. Made good progress and was cleared for discharge to
home on POD # 3.
