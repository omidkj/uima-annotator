Service:  PAIN MED

This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history of
hypertension who presented to an outside hospital after
several days of shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion
with minimal activity.  She also has noted some left arm
pain, but denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting.  On the
morning of admission, she was noted to be more restless and
short of breath while lying in bed.  She was taken to the
outside hospital, where she was noticed to have congestive
heart failure with electrocardiogram notable for an anterior
ST elevation myocardial infarction.

She was Med flighted to [**Hospital1 69**]
for cardiac catheterization.  This is where she was found to
have a proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis of
99% for which she had percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty stent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Breast cancer status post mastectomy at age 61 years old.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Dementia.

HOME MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol 50 mg q day, Synthroid 50 mcg q
day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On physical exam, patient was resting
comfortably.  Vital signs:  Pulse 77, blood pressure 117/48.
Head and neck unremarkable.  No jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  Crackles at bases bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  Abdomen is soft
and nontender.  Extremities:  Trace edema.

Electrocardiogram on admission was normal sinus rhythm,
T-wave inversions in I, aVL, and V6.  Repeat showed continued
T-wave inversions in aVL, [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in V2, [**Street Address(2) 1755**]
elevation V3 and V4, and [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevation V5.

LABORATORIES:  Hematocrit 39.0, platelets 304.  Sodium 142,
potassium 4.1, chloride 105, bicarb 20, BUN 28, creatinine
0.9, glucose 167.  Initial CK were 206, CK MB originally 52
and troponin 1.26.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was sent immediately to
catheterization where a proximal left anterior descending
that was stenosed 99% was stented with a 2.5 by 13 mm stent.
The patient recovered well from procedure and throughout the
course increased to a maximum CK 548, but trended down to
291. CK MB maximum of 52 trending down to 9, and troponin
reached greater than 50.

The patient was started on aspirin, Lipitor, beta blocker,
ACE was held secondary to decreased urine output during the
CCU stay.  Repeat electrocardiogram on [**10-9**] showed
some normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, Q waves in
V1-V3, T-wave inversions V4 through V6, T-wave
flattening/slight inversion in II, III, and aVF.

Patient had a postcatheterization echocardiogram which showed
an ejection fraction of 35% as well as severe valvular
disease including 3+ MR, 3+ TR, 1+ AI.  Patient's urine
output improved once transferred to the floor.  ACE was
restarted.  Beta blocker increased as well as the statin.
Patient's blood pressure is stable in the 120s/60s, pulse
70s.

Course was complicated by a brief period of hypoxia.  When
chest x-ray was taken revealing congestive heart failure with
interstitial edema, she was diuresed and her oxygen
requirement returned to baseline which was none ultimately to
a saturation of being 97% on room air.  Creatinine was
entirely normal throughout the hospital stay, and hematocrit
remained stable about 35 before and after procedure.

Discharged patient to home with physical therapy and visiting
nurse.  She stays with her daughter and son-in-law who helps
to take care of her.

The patient was not put on Coumadin.  Anticoagulation was not
an option secondary to risks outweighed the benefits, such as
risk of fall.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post anterior wall ST
elevation myocardial infarction.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Status post breast cancer.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Dementia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 mg q day x26 days.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
3.  Levothyroxine 15 mcg q day.
4.  Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
5.  Atorvastatin 20 mg q day.
6.  Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
7.  Multivitamin one tablet q day.

The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**1-17**] weeks.
