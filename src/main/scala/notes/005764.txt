Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
cholangitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
64 F with history of common hepatic duct stricture s/p stents
with subsequent removal in [**2142**], s/p CCY, situs inversus,
bipolar disorder, COPD, hypothyroidism presents initially to
[**Location (un) 8641**] with complaints of nausea and abdominal pain. Tbili on
presentation was in the 4.5, AST/ALT 300-300s, Alk phos 550s.
Tbili trended up to 6, and patient febrile to 101 with
increasing abdominal pain.

She underwent emergent ERCP.  On introduction of the catheter,
pus was reported to drain out.  Prior endoscopic sphincterotomy
was open.  Localized stricture in common bile duct near
bifurcation but contrast was able to get around the proximal
obstruction.  There was evidence of distal obstruction on the
right hepatic system, and dilation of distal ducts.  The right
hepatic system did not drain at all, only part of the left
hepatic system was draining, although very sluggishly.  They
were able to advance a thin wire into the right hepatic system,
but unable to place a stent or even perform a balloon.  They
were not able to advance a wire into the left system at all.
She had been transiently hypotensive during ERCP, but recovered
following procedure, was successfully extubated.  Following ERCP
she was given Vancomycin x1 and continued no Zosyn.

On arrival to the ICU, patient is tired but arousable, oriented
and appropriate.  She endorses RUQ pain, especially with
movement.  She was febrile to 100.6.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o F with history of CHD stricture s/p multiple ERCP with
prior stents (removed), s/p CCY, presenting with CBD occlusion
and cholangitis, ERCP performed at OSH but unable to perform
interventions due to technical difficulty. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.

# CBD occulsion/Cholangitis - Patient has a history of CHD
stricture and has had three ERCPs performed from [**2141**]-[**2142**] with
stents placed which were subsequently retrieved.  ERCP at [**Location (un) 8641**]
performed on [**2146-11-2**] showed obstruction at bifurcation of CBD
with evidence of distal obstruction, but unable to perform
intervention.  Maintained on Zosyn with one dose post ERCP Vanc
given.  Blood cultures from her admission in [**2142**] without any
specific bacterial growth, had been treated and discharged on
Cipro/Flagyl at that time.  On transfer, patient meet SIRS
criteria with fever, leukocytosis and tachycardia [**1-5**] infection.
 Initially Zosyn was continued and Vanc DCed.  On [**11-3**], patient
underwent ERCP during which CBD cannulated [**1-5**] stricture w/
sludge/pus. Stent was placed. Antibiotics changed to Cipro and
Flagyl for a total 7-day course.  Plan to repeat ERCP in 3 weeks
for stricture dilatation.  However, blood cultures were positive
for gram positive cocci in pairs and vancomycin was added, which
will also be continued for 7 days.

# Bacteremia: Blood cultures positive for gram positive cocci in
one bottle (only one set drawn. [**Month (only) 116**] be contaminant.  Blood
cultures redrawn and pending at time of discharge.  Treated with
cipro, flagyl and vancomycin for 7 days.

# Altered mental status: Patient initially solmnolent, arousable
to painful stimuli.  Likely [**1-5**] to sepsis. Mental status
improved post procedure. Held fentanyl patch.

# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine dose increased to 112.5 daily at
OSH due to low TSH.  Will need outpatient follow up to adjust
dosing.

# COPD: Continued flovent and prn nebs.

# Bipolar disorder: Continue lithium, duloxetine and risperdone.

# Chronic pain: Continued dicyclomine prn.  Initially held
fentanyl patch given increased solmnolence in the setting of
infection, acute pain controlled with dilaudid.

# Transitional issues:
- Vancomycin, Cipro and Flagyl for a total 7-day course.
- Levothyroxine dose increased to 112.5 daily, will need
outpatient follow up.
- Repeat ERCP in 3 weeks for stricture dilation
- Follow-up [**Hospital1 18**] blood cultures from [**2146-11-4**]
- Will need vancomycin trough level check prior to 4th dose
([**2146-11-5**] @ 8pm)
