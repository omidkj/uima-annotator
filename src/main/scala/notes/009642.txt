Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
82 yo woman w/ a hx of stage IV COPD, afib on coumadin, chronic
diastolic CHF, mild-to-moderate AS, DM and [**Hospital **] transferred from
[**Hospital6 5016**] for management of respiratory failure and
hypotension.
.
Patient was originially admitted on [**2150-8-6**] with a complaint of
cough and thick expectorations, shortness of breath and
desaturations. She was found to have RLL and RML infiltrations
as well as bilateral pulmonary venous congestion on her
admission CXR. She was started IV vanc and meropenem for
coverage of hospital aquired organsims given a reccent
hospitaliation in [**2150-6-5**] for ESBL UTI. She was maintained on
noninvasive ventilation and diuresed with lasix given an
elevated BNP of 214 on admission. Her COPD exacerbation was
treated with IV solumedrol initially and then she was
transitioned to PO prednisone 40 mg daily. She was eventually
discharged from the ICU at [**Hospital3 **] and maintained on the
floor. During her floor stay she was noted to be sloly retaining
more CO2 and then intubated on [**8-21**] for a pH of 7.19, pCO2 70.
Her pressures were declining over the 24 hours prior to transfer
and despite NS boluses required initiation of norepinephrine and
hydrocortisone. Her mental status after call out from the ICU
continued to be altered and she had a NCHCT as well as EEG which
did not show any acute processes. An CXR performed the day of
transfer showed a bilateral lower lobe infiltrate suggestive of
aspiration.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 99.4, 115, 123/60, 97%RA.
Patient was intubated and sedated.

Discharge:
No labs were drawn on discharge

Imaging:
CXR [**8-21**]:
IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube satisfactory.  Right effusion
probably due to failure.

CXR [**8-25**]:
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**8-23**], the right IJ
catheter has
been removed.  Other monitoring and support devices remain in
place.

Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
bilateral
effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Continued
elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure.

CXR [**8-27**]:
Comparison is made to prior study [**8-25**].

Severe cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.
Right perihilar
consolidation has increased.  Bibasilar opacities, a combination
of pleural
effusion and adjacent consolidations, are improving on the left
though the
component of pleural effusion on the right has minimally
increased.  ET tube
is in standard position.  Left PICC tip is in the upper SVC , NG
tube tip is
out of view below the diaphragm.

CXR [**8-28**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing
bilateral
pleural effusions have decreased in extent.  However, the
effusions are still
clearly present and there is evidence of basal areas of
atelectasis.  The
monitoring and support devices are in constant position.  There
is unchanged
mild to moderate pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly.  No
newly appeared
focal parenchymal opacities.

CT Abdomen [**8-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Nodular opacities in the lung bases with right lower lobe
cavitary nodule,
concerning for infection.
2.  8.8 x 8.5 cm uterine mass that could represent a fibroid
although its
large size is atypical in a patient of this age and endometrial
carcinoma
cannot be excluded.  Further evaluation is recommended with
pelvic ultrasound.
3.  Ascites and anasarca. A region of ill defined hyperdensity
in left mid
abdominal ascites is indeterminate due to lack of contrast and
could represent
bowel loops, though if malignancy were identified (such as after
pelvic
ultrasound) then omental density such as due to metastasis might
be suspected.
  4.  5.0-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm and 3.7 cm aortic
aneurysm at the level
of the diaphragmatic hiatus, both incompletely evaluated in the
absence of
intravenous contrast.

Microbiology:
Blood cultures negative from [**8-21**], [**8-27**], [**8-28**]
Urine culture negative from [**8-27**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief ICU Course:
82 yo w/ hx of COPD, dCHF, Afib, aortic stenosis who was
transferred from an outside hosputal for hospitalization
complicated by ESBL UTI (treated), pneumonia with worsening
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She
preogressed to multi-organ failure and family decision was made
to keep the patient comfortable but not to escalate care. The
patient died on [**2150-9-3**] from cardiopulmonary failure.

Active Issues:
# Hypotension: The patient presented from outside hospital on
norepinephrine. This was weaned off within 12 hours of
admission. She was started on a methylprednisolone taper, given
her COPD and past history of steroid use. The most likely
etiology for her hypotension was sepsis. Her blood pressures
were maintained with intermittent IVF boluses.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient presented from
outside hospital intubated for respiratory failure. Her blood
gas was most consistent with a respiratory acidosis with
concurrent mild metabolic acidosis. Possible etiologies included
pneumonia (likely HCAP given recent hospitalization), COPD
exacerbation, and volume overload. She completed a course of
vancomycin and meropenem for HCAP. Once her blood pressures
stabilized, d
