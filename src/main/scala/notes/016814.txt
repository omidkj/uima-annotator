History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 101609**] is a 68 year old female with a history of dilated
cardiomyopathy with resolution on recent ECHO, htn, DM2 who
presents with SOB. She states that her SOB started acutely last
night at ~ 8 pm and was associated with lightheadedness. It
began after going to the mailbox to get the mail and did not
begin until she sat down. She also had an episode of prolonged
coughing which was minimally productive of greenish sputum at
the same time. She denies any prior SOB or DOE although she does
note chronic orthopnea. She does note increased LE swelling over
the last month. She notes her regular weight it 215 lbs and her
weight on ICU admission is 240 lbs (she was 212 lbs on [**2104-12-19**]
sleep visit). She denies any significant cough prior to last
night. She denies fevers but does note chills for the last
month. She also notes urinary frequency for the last month but
denies dysuria. Last night, her SOB improved after 30 minutes of
rest. She felt better this am but then had dyspnea while going
through her mail and her HHA felt she looked SOB when she got to
the house so she hit her medic alert necklace and was brought to
the ED. She also notes bilateral calf pain, R worse than L.
.
In the ED, 97.9, 72, 127/85, 20, 93% RA. Labs remarkable for
normal WBC count, Hct at 33 within recent baseline, electrolytes
were normal with exception of BUN/Cr 26/1.1 (BL Cr 0.9-1.0, CEs
were negative x 1. Lactate was 2.4. CXR showed possible L hilar
consolidation. U/A consistent with UTI. She received 1 gram of
ceftriaxone and 750 mg of levofloxacin. Her BPs transiently
dropped to SBPs in 80s which resolved to 1 L of NS with increase
in SBPs to 110s. She received an additional L of NS following
this drop. At the time of transfer to the ICU, her SBP was in
the 120s. Also of note, her ECG showed weinkeboch at a rate in
the 50s which was new compared to prior. Cardiology was
consulted with the ED and did not think any further intervention
was required.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is in NAD. She feels comfortable.
She denies any significant SOB. She denies any current or recent
chest pain. She does note calf pain bilaterally which has been
chronic. As above she denies fevers but does not chills x 1
month. Denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, dysuria. She does note urinary frequency.

Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed due to arrhythmia.
