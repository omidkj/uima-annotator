Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nephrostomy tube placement


History of Present Illness:
47 yo F w/ h/o steroid-induced hyperglycemia, SLE w/ h/o
pericarditis, transverse myelitis w/ paraplegia and neurogenic
bladder s/p urostomy w/ ileal conduit, h/o ureteropelvic stone
and urosepsis, and h/o RLE DVT a/w F [**2168-9-24**] transferred to
MICU [**2168-9-25**] for hypotn resistant to IVFs and stress steroids.
Patient initially p/w c/o sudden onset N/abd pain/chills w/ T
103 at NH. Rigors progressed so she was brought to ED. She
reported h/o fatigue and anorexia for the past few days and had
noticed foul smelling urine and some abdominal distension,
similar to prior episodes of pyelo. She also c/o LLQ and groin
pain which responded to tylenol. She denies V or D. No AMS. No
c/o CP. On arrival to ED, temperature was 101.2. CT abd showed
an 8 mm right proximal ureteral stone with right-sided
hydronephrosis and inflammatory stranding, in addition to
pyelonephritis of the left kidney without left sided
hydronephrosis. Labs were remarkable for wbc 23.5 w/ 1% bands
which decreased to 14 today but now w/ 15% bands on vanc (h/o
MRSA urosepsis) and gent (mult drug allergies). AG on admission
18 (bicarb 17, down from 23 on a previous admission), down to AG
15 this AM. ABG prior to transfer (on room air): 7.43/24/69 w/
lactate 1.3 (down from 1.4 on the prior day). Currently, [**1-8**]
blood cx are growing GNR in both anaerobic bottles. Urine cx is
pending. Prior to transfer, patient dropped bp to 68/40s. BP did
not improve despite 2 L NS and 100 mg IV hydrocortisone. A
central line was placed and she was sent to IR for a right
nephrostomy tube.

Past Medical History:
## h/o nephrolithiasis s/p lithotripsy and h/o left
ureteropelvic junction stone '[**65**] spontaneously passing by U/S,
no evidence of right stone on most recent u/s 5 months ago
## h/o pyelo, last episode in '[**65**] (MRSA in blood and urine)
## SLE w/ h/o pericarditis, last flare couple years ago, didn't
flare w/ urosepsis
## Devic's disease: Recurrent transverse myelitis with sequelae
of
paraplegia-exacerbation in 93 Recurrent bilateral optic neuritis
with legal  (neurologist: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Hospital1 18**]) - (steroids
increased to 40 qd in [**Month (only) **] for concern for recurrent optic
neuritis which turned out to be capsular ossification)
## blindness in right eye.
## Bilateral knee arthritis
## Suspected glaucoma in left eye, turned out to be capsular
ossification or a secondary cataract, corrected w/ laser surgery
[**2168-8-29**]
## Urostomy s/p ileal loop conduit in [**2160**] for neurogenic
bladder w/ persistent leak
## Steroid-induced hyperglycemia
## Hypothyroid
## Osteoporosis
## Hx of DVT in RLE '[**55**] - on coumadin for a couple years and
then ASA until a couple months ago
