Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10680**] was admitted to the floor to receive FFP in order to
bring his INR below 1.5 so that he could have pleuroscopy the
following day.  During the first night of his admission, he was
in a fib on telemetry and his heart rate was initially in the
150's.  He had not taken his evening dose of atenolol yet.  He
was given that dose, as well as a dose of IV lopressor.  His
heart rate then came down to the 110's.  Later that evening, he
required another dose of IV lopressor as well as PO metoprolol.

*
Mr. [**Known lastname 58571**] INR was originally 2.3.  He was initially given 2
units of FFP which brought his INR down to 1.9.  An additional 2
units were given; however, his INR was still too high at 1.8.
The procedure was postponed until the following day so that the
patient could receive more FFP in an attempt to lower his INR <
1.5.  He was given an additional 2 units of FFP overnight, and a
recheck of his INR was 1.8.  He was given 2 more units of FFP,
but his INR remained at 1.8.  He was brought to the operating
room to have a VATS by thoracic surgery despite having an
INR=1.8.  He required the OR because it was a weekend day, and
there were no [**Name8 (MD) 58572**] RN's to do the procedure in the
pulmonary procedure suite.  After the procedure, the patient had
a prolonged stay in the PACU because he was in rapid a fib and
had new onset mild CHF (likely rate related).  He was diuresed
and rate controlled (with diltiazem drip and PO metoprolol).  He
was maintained on dilt drip and metoprolol on transfer to the
floor.  Thoracic surgery recommended that they perform a
decortication later in the week to free the patient's trapped
lung.
*
For the following week, the patient was continued on rate
control with diltiazem drip and metoprolol.  His metoprolol was
slowly titrated up while trying to keep SBP>90.  He was bolused
gently on [**1-3**] occasions for low BP (with 250 cc NS).  Overall,
the patient did well in the pre-op period; however, his rate was
difficult to control while maintaining adequate BP.  His rate
remained in the range of 90-110 (occasionally up to 120), with
BP in range of 90-110/50-80.  His INR continued to rise despite
receiving FFP and holding coumadin.  After reaching 3.2, vitamin
K 5mg po was given x 1 dose to reverse pt so he would be able to
go for decortication.  After vitamin K, the patient's INR fell
to 1.9.*
Cardiology was consulted the day prior to surgery for
recommendations of better rate control.  They recommended
digoxin 0.125 mg PO qd and lisinopril 75mg PO TID for rate
control. The patient was rate controlled prior to left
thorocatomy and decortication on [**6-28**]. Post-operatively the
patient did well and was transferred to the ICU intubated. The
patient's TSH was evaluated and deemed to be low POD #1 with
this may have been adding to difficult with rate control of his
afib. His anti- hyperthroid med methimazole 10 mg PO BOD was
restarted POD 5.The patient was diuresed with lasix while in the
unit and responded well and his creatinine remained stable. He
was treated with aggressive pulmonary toilet and his chest tubes
remained to suction. POD 3 the patient had a PA and Lateral CxR
to evaluate the left lung and the fluid in the intrapleural
space. The patient's CXR appeared stable and much improved to
previous films that had showed a large pleural effusion on the
left side.The patient's pain was managed with PO morphine PRN
and toradol 15mg PO PRN. The was put on aspiration precaustions
and his INR was stable at 2.5. The patient began to work with PT
on POD 3 in order to improve his mobility. The patient had a
weak cough and difficulty moving around in bed.The patient
remained stable in the unit POD [**3-6**]. He was transfered to the
floor on POD 6 where he was restarted on all his home meds.
Particularly he was switched from lopressor to atenolol and
restarted on his glyburide 1.5 mg PO BID and coumadin 2 mg PO
qd. The patient continued to work with PT and made improvement
in his strength and previously limited mobility. The patient
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in addtion to a prior schedule
pulmonology appointment. THe patient is going to rehab on all
his prior meds and on the same doses of those medications. He is
doing well and will require once a day dressing changes along
with physical therapy in order to increase his strength and
mobility. The patient will also require aggressive pulmonary
toilet and encourage for taking food.
