Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neurosurgical service on [**2175-1-13**]
and underwent bilateral cranioplasties without complication on
[**2175-1-13**]. She was extubated without difficulty and transferred to
the TICU in stable condition.  In the early post-operative
course Ms. [**Known lastname **] did well and was transferred to the floor. On
[**1-4**], she was neurologically intact. 24 HR EEG was performed to
try to discontinue keppra. No seizure activity was seen in the
first 6 hrs of EEG. JP drain remained in place and output was
70cc overnight.   On [**1-13**], EEG demonstrated no seizures.  Keppra
doses were continue to be weaned off.  on [**1-15**], a repeat EEG was
obtained which showed no evidence of seizure focus.   On [**1-16**],
her JP drain was removed in routine fashion.  Pre-procedure HCG
and labs were done and she was made npo after midnight on [**1-17**].
She proceded to the angio suite for a completion of coiling of
left aca aneurysm. This was uneventful - she recovered well in
the ICU and was cleared for discharge to home by PT.  She agrees
with this plan.
