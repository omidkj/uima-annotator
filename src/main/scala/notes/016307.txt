Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Fish Protein / Brimonidine / Penicillins / Lipitor / Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Drug eluting stent placement in the left circumflex artery

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2146**],
COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and allergy to ASA, who presents from
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for aspirin desensitization prior to
cardiac catheterization.  The patient was admitted to OSH on
[**2159-6-29**] for three days of progressive dyspnea.  CXR in the ED
showed questionable right basilar infiltrate, so the the patient
was started on Levofloxacin and Solu-Medrol for COPD
exacerbation.  During this admission, the patient also
complained of [**3-6**] substernal chest pressure, radiating to her
left shoulder.  She had associated dyspnea and lightheadedness;
however, she states that this pain is not reminiscent of her
previous MI in [**2146**].  She was treated with Levoquin, Solumedrol,
and standing Ipratropium and Albuterol nebulizations, and her
respiratory status improved.
.
Of note, the patient has had increasing anginal symptoms over
the past month.  She was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] last month
with hypertensive urgency and declined a stress test and cardiac
cath at this time.  Over the past week, she was noted to have
increasing angina, relieved with rest or SL NTG.  On admission
to OSH, her troponin was elevated at 0.19, CK was 103, and MB
was 9.1.  Given concern for unstable angina, the patient agreed
to cardiac catheterization and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cath and aspirin desensitization.
.
In terms of her ASA allergy, the patient states that she has
never had anaphylaxis, urticaria, or angioedema to ASA.  She had
ASA 30 years ago and states that it caused shortness of breath
and bronchoconstriction.  She has avoided ASA and all NSAIDS
since this time.  She also notes having nasal polyps.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  She does admit to
increasing LE edema for the past 4 months, stable orthopnea (2
pillows at home), and chest pain as described above.

CATH [**2159-7-3**]
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3
vessel disease. The LMCA was free of angiographically apparent
disease.
The LAD had serial 80% lesions in the midportion. The LCx had an
80%
lesion in the midportion at the bifurcation of the OM2 and a
small OM3.
The RCA demonstrated severe diffuse disease with retrograde
filling from
the SVG.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed distal vessels filling
the LIMA
without evidence of significant disease. The vessel distal to
the SVG
was without significant disease.
3. Successful placement of a 3.0x15mm Vision bare-metal stent
was
performed in the LCX-OM2.  Final angiography showed normal flow
in the
OM2, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.  The
jailed OM3
had a 50% ostial stenosis and TIMI 2 flow.  (See PTCA comments.)

4. The right common femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed
using a
Mynx device.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient has a significant
history of CAD, s/p CABG in [**2146**] with repeat cath in [**2151**]
showing patent LIMA->LAD and SVG->R-PDA.  She presents with a
one-month history of unstable angina in the setting of elevated
troponin (0.19) and ST-T wave changes on ECG.  This may
represents NSTEMI v. demand ischemia in the setting of COPD
exacerbation. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for ASA desensitization
prior to cath. She was on heparin gtt for 48 hrs, and continued
on home doses of Losartan, HCTZ, Plavix, Lisinopril, Carvedilol
and Imdur. Atorvastatin was increased to 80 mg daily. She
received IV hydration and Mucomyst pre-cath given chronic renal
insufficiency. She also underwent ASA desensitization as below.
Cardiac cath showed de [**Last Name (un) 11083**] LCX stenosis at bifurcation with an
OM, and bare-metal stent in LCx was placed. Patient remained
hemodynamically stable after the procedure, but did have
continued oozing of blood from the groin site. Hct remained
stable. Patient was continued on Integrillin gtt 18 hrs
post-cath. Patient complained of [**10-6**] back pain post-cath,
likely muscular pain, improved with morphine prn. Hct and
platelets were stable, and pain resolved spontaneously.
.
#. ASA Desensitization:  The patient has a history of
bronchoconstriciton in response to ASA. Allergy was consulted
and the following protocol was developed. Patient received
increasing ASA doses starting with 20.25 mg ASA and increasing
every 90 min as tolerated: 40.5 mg, 81 mg, 162.5 mg, 325 mg.
Peak flow was measured every 90 min. Patient tolerated this
protocol well, with peak flows stable compared to baseline. She
is now on 325 mg aspirin daily and should continue indefinitely.

.
#. COPD exacerbation:  The patient has a history of COPD and was
admitted on [**6-29**] for COPD exacerbation.  Her CXR was consistent
with possible PNA v. atelectasis.  Her P
