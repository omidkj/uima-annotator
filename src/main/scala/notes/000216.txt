Generalized fatigue, dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 41 yo man w/ hypoplastic MDS and
tracheobronchitis who presented to the heme malignancy service
for admission on [**2123-7-31**] with hemoptysis and worsened cough,
dyspnea. Prior to this, he was admitted from [**Date range (3) 48682**] for
treatment with ATG for 5 days. This course was complicated by
temps to 100.7 that were thought to be related to the ATG. No
antibiotics were given at that time. During that admission, he
also developed shortness of breath. CXR showed worsening
bilateral infiltrates. Chest CTA that r/o PE and demonstrated
diffuse b/l patchy airspace opacities and ground glass opacities
(marked progression from previous CT [**7-13**]).  Pulmonary was
consulted and performed a bronchoscopy on [**7-19**] that demonstrated
tracheobronchitis with diffuse upper airway erythema and some
mucosal bleeding, but no signs of Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage.
BAL washings were sent which were negative for bacterial,viral
or fungal organisms. Etiology of the patient's respiratory
decompensation was not clear but was believed to be likely
secondary to the ATG therapy or related to an underlying viral
infection.  Pt was treated with diuresis as needed, standing
atrovent inhaler (per pulm recs), steroids were tapered,
platelets were maintained > 50, and oxygen was weaned as
tolerated.  Pt improved with these
limited interventions and repeat CXR on [**7-23**] showed marked
improvement compared to earlier one on [**7-19**].  Pt was d/ced
without oxygen requirement.
.
He was then re-admitted on [**9-1**]/05 with generalized fatigue.
Patient's presentation was thought most likely serum sickness
secondary to antithrombocyte globulin.  Prednisone dose was
increased and he received 2units of PRBCs and 2 units of
platelets. At discharge the patient's Hct was 28.7 and plts were
28.He was discharged on [**2123-7-30**] on prednisone and PCP prophylaxis
[**Name Initial (PRE) **]/ bactrim. Of note, patient had severe headache but had
negative head CT. One day later, patient re-presented with
worsened sob as above.

Unit HPI:
cc: unit transfer for worsening hypoxia and dyspnea

bactrim. Of note, patient had severe headache but had negative
head CT. One day later, patient re-presented with worsened sob
as above.
.
Upon presentation for the present admission, pt was hypoxic to
96% on 4L NC. He was afebrile (but on steroids) and his vitals
were otherwise stable. He was diuresed. Repeat chest CT with
diffuse, bilateral alveolar opacities thought to be ?drug
toxicity, diffuse viral pneumonia, ?TRALI. Over next days,
patients resp status waxed and waned but oxygen requirement
steadily increased.  Steroids were increased for concern for
DAH, lasix intermittently given for concern for chf. Echo
repeated and was normal. SOB noted to be worse at night. Pulm
consulted and wished for bronch, but tenuous resp status of
concern. Patient requiring non rebreather for most of time, but
was still able to walk/talk. He would immediately desat to 80's
if mask off or with a lot of exertion. [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team consulted
several times prior to today, but patient always remained stable
and decision by heme team to keep patient on their service. ARDS
from antithymocyte globulin has been reported in the literature
and is thought to be contributing to patient's progression.
Addition of broad spectrum antiviral, anti-pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) 48683**], and
anti-bacterial treatments slowly added in succession and
treatment with high dose steroids completed. Today, patient
acutely hypoxic, dyspneic on floor, requiring 100% NRB and high
flow oxygen with sats in 80'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] called for emergent
transfer. Anesthesia called immediately and patient intubated on
floor. Patient then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name **].

Past Medical History:
PMH:
**Hypoplastic MDS - primary oncologist- [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**]. Pt was
initially diagnosed in [**2116**] after w/u for fatigue.  He was
maintained for years on initially just Aranesp, and then w/
Aranesp and Danazol.
Recently ([**Month (only) 596**]/[**Month (only) **]) pt with trending downward HCt, easy
bruisability. BM bx was performed in [**2123-5-28**], that
demonstrated normal cellularity of approx 30-40%, trilineage
dysplasia, <1% myeloblasts (on nucleated cells).  At this time,
decision was made to proceed with ATG/cyclosporin therapy vs
BMT.
