History of Present Illness:
Patient suffered a right 5th metatarsal fracture [**2174-9-14**] due to
"rolling on it". Originally patient had a splint but reported
significant swelling/pain and was changed to an air cast 2 weeks
ago. Other than resting at home for two days following the
injury, patient has been walking and going to work (denies
immobilization). On Wednesday night she felt dizzy while
cleaning her room. The dizziness did not resolve and she started
seeing black/yellow spots. At one point she felt she "blacked
out" (+ LOC) and had to rest on her bed. She experienced SOB
with mild exertion (walking to bathroom). She also describes
significant pleuritic pain. She tried drinking fluids because
she thought she was dehydrated. The patient drank more fluids
and slept with her feet elevated, but woke up on thursday still
feeling unwell. The patient does not have a PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she went to
the urgent care clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] and was sent to the ED in an
ambulance.

Pertinent Results:
CT-PE protocol: Bilateral massive pulmonary emboli are present,
involving lobar, segmental and subsegmental arteries. Leftward
bowing of the ventricular septum suggests right heart strain.
Minimal atelectasis noted in the right lung base, otherwise, the
lungs are clear.  No other abnormalities noted.

Cardiac Echo: Dilated RV cavity size with RV systolic
dysfunction. In the setting of a pulmonary embolism this is
consistent with RV strain.

LENI: DVT of the right popliteal vein, extending into the
proximal
superficial veins of the calf.

Brief Hospital Course:
23 year old female with recent right metatarsal fracture,
treated with immobilization presents with pulmonary embolism,
causing pleuritic pain, DOE, tachycardia, and syncopal episode.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: Presenting symptoms included tachycardia,
syncope, and hypotension. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed by
CT-A. Following fluid resuscitation in ER, patient was
hemodynamically stable on admission to MICU. Thrombolysis was
discussed but felt to have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio
given clinical stability. Anticoagulation with heparin was
initiated per weight-based protocol.  Echocardiogram showed RV
heart strain. LENI demonstrated DVT of the right popliteal vein,
extending into the proximal superficial veins of the calf. IVC
filter would have significant comorbidity at this age. Patient
transferred to the floor and started on Coumadin with Heparin
bridge. Bridged on Heparin drip for 24 hours when Coumadin
reached therapeutic INR [**2-13**]. Patient to remain on
anti-coagulation for 6 months followed by [**Hospital 191**] clinic. Primary
care provider can consider hypercoagulable work-up due to young
age, however patient did have risk factor of right metatarsal
fracture with tight splint fit. No significant family history.

.
# Right 5th metatarsal fracture: Weight as tolerated with air
cast and crutches. Patient to follow up with orthopedics.

# Syncope:  She presented with syncope, likely related to her
pulmonary embolism.  She had no further episodes.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
Pulmonary Embolism
Deep [**Last Name (un) **] thrombosis

Secondary:
Metatrasal fracture


Discharge Condition:
Good, ambulating with stable vitals.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a pulmonary embolism due to a deep vein
thrombosis. This was most likely caused by your metatrasal
injury, but please discuss with your primary care provider
whether [**Name Initial (PRE) **] hypercoagulability work-up is indicated. You need to
be on coumadin for 6 months for therapeutic INR [**2-13**]. Please
follow-up with orthopedics regarding your metatrasal injury,
until then walk using an air cast.

We are discharging you on Coumadin. It is very important to
follow your INR level. You will be followed by the [**Hospital 191**]
[**Hospital **] clinic their phone number is ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10844**]
starting on Tuesday, before then Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13959**].
1) Go to [**Company 191**] Associates to have your INR drawn on Monday morning
[**2174-10-10**]. I have printed out a script. They will forward the
results to Dr.[**Name (NI) 29792**] office and he will contact you if you
need to adjust your coumadin dose. On Tuesday [**Hospital 191**]
[**Hospital 2786**] clinic will follow your INR.
2) Take Coumadin 7.5 mg Friday, 5mg Sat, 7.5 mg Sunday until
told otherwise by Dr.[**Name (NI) 29792**] office.
