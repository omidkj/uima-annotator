Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant
system with
3-vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA was a short vessel with no
angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD was heavily
calcified and
diffusely diseased in the mid-vessel up to 70%.  The LCx was
diffusely
diseased in the mid-vessel with a long lesion up to 80%.  A
large OM1
branch had a 50-60% proximal stenosis.  The RCA was calcified
with a
total occlusion in the proximal vessel.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right- and

left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 16 mmHg, mean PCW 22
mmHg).  There
was moderate pulmonary artery hypertension (mean PA 32 mmHg).
The
cardiac index was severely depressed at 1.6 L/min/m2.
3.  The patient entered the lab in complete heart block with an
escape
rate of 40 bpm.  A 5 French temporary pacing wire was placed in
the
right ventricle with successful capture and pacing at 60 bpm.
The
patient's heart block resolved and the pacing wire was was
removed at
the end of the case.
4.  Successful stenting of the mid RCA was performed with
overlapping
3.0 x 18 mm and 3.5 x 18 mm Hepacoat stents.
5.  Successful closure of the right groin was performed with a
6Fr
Angioseal device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated filling pressures.
3. Acute inferior MI, terminated by primary PCI.
4. Angioseal of the groin.

Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Resting
regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferior akinesis and inferolateral
hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular free
wall is not
fully visualized but systolic function appears depressed. The
aortic root is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2152-12-29**],
regional wall motion abnormality is new and estimated pulmonary
artery
systolic pressure is now higher.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:

1. Patchy right lower lobe opacity, likely represent
atelectasis.

2. The previously described hazy opacity overlying the right
hemithorax is less apparent on the current study.

3. Small left pleural effusions.

4. Emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted from the cath lab after stenting of his
RCA to treat his ST elevation inferior MI and complete heart
block.  He recovered well from his MI and heart block and was
discharged to acute rehab due to deconditioning and recent
issues with falling/loss of balance.

Problems addressed included:
1. CAD: Initially was transcutaneously paced before cath.  Did
not require pacing afterwards.  His MI was inferior and appears
to involve the RV.  He was initially given ASA, Plavix, and 18
hours of integrilin.  His lipitor was increased to 80 mg qd.  He
was slowly started on an ACE-I as his BP would tolerate.  A
beta-blocker was then added and increased to his current dose of
metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  He tolerated these well.  No additional
chest pain during the admission.  His enzymes were cycled, and
his CK peaked at 1443.

2. Pump issues: He had an echo which showed an EF=45-50%, with
some akinetic areas.  His ACE-I was continued for afterload
reduction.  It was decided not to anticoagulate him due to
recent history of large GIB.  He had [**Last Name **] problem maintaining his
BP during admission.

3.EP/cardiac rhythm: He initially had a prolonged PR interval
and RBBB.  Also has h/o A fib.  Again, was decided that we would
not restart coumadin due to GIB risk.  He developed both
frequent NSVT and went into a fib while here.  He was started on
amiodarone (loading with 400 [**Hospital1 **] x7d, then 400 qd x7d, then 200
qd ongoing)and kept on his B-blocker.  This will address both
arrhythmias effectively in someone who is not likely a candidate
for an ICD if the NSVT continues. Baseline LFTs and TFTs were
obtained prior to amio.  He will need close follow-up of this
NSVT to determine effectiveness of amiodarone.  It was
asymptomatic wh
