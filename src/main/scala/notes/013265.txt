<b> Studies: </b>
RADS:

[**6-20**]: CXR:
Dobbhoff catheter tip is not included on the radiograph. Stable
widening of the cardiac silhouette with left lower lobe
atelectasis and right mid and basilar consolidation.

[**6-19**]; CT Chest /Abdomen and pelvis: 1. Patchy ground-glass
opacity of the lungs may represent persistent volume overload
but is concerning for superimposed pneumonia.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with persistent collapse of
the left
lower lobe.
3. No change in a 2 cm soft tissue density adjacent to the
sternum, which is of uncertain etiology but may represent a
lymph node.
4. Stable inflammatory stranding in the splenectomy bed. No
fluid collection or abscess identified.

[**6-17**]; CXR: . Possible acute aortic dilatation or mediastinal
hematoma. Evaluation should begin with upright chest radiograph.

2. Improved severe pulmonary edema.
3. Worsening left upper lobe atelectasis. Unchanged left lower
lobe
atelectasis.

[**6-13**]: MR head w/Gd: 1. No abnormal enhancement, intraaxial
masses, or abnormal signal to suggest acute infarction.

2. Thin dural enhancement along the left parietal lobe that is
nonspecific in origin, but could reflect the sequelae of prior
trauma (resolved subdural hematoma) or prior lumbar puncture

[**6-12**]: Ct Abd/Pelv: No significant change in abdominal findings
compared to prior study. Slight improvement in ground glass
opacity consistent with improving edema. Interval increase in
size of bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right side.

[**6-12**]: Ct head: Limited examination due to patient motion
artifact. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Density seen in the
right sylvian fissure region may represent prior Pantopaque
administration or may be due to focal calcification in this
area.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2149-4-30**] with a post
operative fever and incision site drainage.  She was pan
cultured at that time and started on Zosyn and Flagyl
empirically.  A CXR at that time demonstrated patchy asymmetric
opacities bilaterally, concerning for pneumonia.  She refused a
CPAP mask but accepted 12L face mask oxygen.  She is home CPAP
dependent.  She was kept NPO.  Her coumadin was held in case she
needed an operation or drainage of an abscess.  She was started
on 10mg Prednisone, as she has known adrenal insufficiency.  She
tolerated her own CPAP machine overnight.  A CT scan with
contrast showed prominent inflammatory stranding in the left
upper quadrant and around the pancreatic tail, most likely
representing postoperative changes.  There was also a tiny
amount of fluid in the splenic fossa, but no drainable
collections were identified.  There was also bibasilar
atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.  On HD 2 her
diet was advanced.  Zosyn was discontinued.  PT/OT saw her and
recommended rehab.  We treated her with aggressive pulmonary
toilet.  A CXR was unchanged.  Later that night the patient had
an acute event- Her HR was in the 40's with decreased oxygen
saturations and no palpable pulse.  Chest compressions were
begun and she was intubated emergently.  She was given
epinepherine X 1 and her HR improved to 100.  She was saturating
100%.  Her BP was 100/50.  A right IJ TLC was placed.  She was
transferred to the ICU.  She was sedated with propofol.  On HD
3, A chest X-ray demonstrated severe pulmonary edema.  Cardiac
enzymes were cycled and were not elevated.  An echocardiogram
showed an EF > 55%, moderate TR, and mild-moderate pulmonary
HTN.  She was kept NPO.  Her createnine bumped to 3.4, likely as
a result of contrast nephropathy.  She was started on Vancomycin
and Zosyn in addition to her Flagyl, as she was febrile to 102
and may have gone into septic shock.  Her TLC was changed to a
Swann Ganz catheter for better monitoring of her fluid status
given her new onset ARF and pulmonary edema.  On HD 4, she was
off of Levophed and she remained hemodynamically stable all day.
 Endocrinology saw the patient and started hydrocortisone at
100mg Q 8 hours for stress dose steroids.  The renal service saw
her and did not recommend dialysis at this time, but they did
recommend limiting her fluid intake.  She had only low grade
temperatures that day.  Her UOP was 91 for the day.  On HD 5,
her createnine was up to 4.0.  Her WBC was 18.  A CT of the head
was negative.  A repeat CT of the abdomen without contrast
showed increased inflammatory stranding and possibly a small
amount of fluid around the pancreatic tail, bilateral pulmonary
effusions (worsening on the ri
