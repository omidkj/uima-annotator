Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line placed at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], replaced at [**Hospital1 18**] ICU and
removed prior to discharge

History of Present Illness:
49-year-old female with a lymphoproliferative disorder (LGL,
treated at [**Hospital1 112**]; last dose of methotrexate [**2103-7-30**]),
hyperglandular autoimmune syndrome (hypoparathyroidism and
adrenal insufficiency), leg ulcers, and asthma who presented to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**10-7**] with the course described below:

She was initially thought to have sepsis either from leg ulcer
infection, urinary or pulmonary source, and was initially
treated with Ceftriaxone and vancomycin, which was then changed
to unasyn, then evenutally to zosyn. She had initially been on
levophed and hydorcortisone as well, which were then weaned off.
She has been off pressors for 4 days. Urine culture grew Beta
hemolytic strep. Her wound culture grew Staphylococcus which
were sensitive to cephalosporins. She is transferred to us on
zosyn alone.
.
Also in the differential for her hypotension (and accompanying
tachycardia) was PE, and a VQ scan was done on [**10-7**] which was
low probability, so HR's in the 110-140's attributed to
deconditioning and anxiety. She had initially been on heparin
gtt, which was d/c'ed when VQ scan was low prob; she had been
maintained on lovenox SQ for DVT ppx per report. Also of note,
she was noted to be volume overloaded and received lasix during
her hospitalization eventually requiring intermittent BiPAP as
well.
.
Non-contrast CT Chest (b/c of renal failure) was then done on
[**10-13**] which showed large pleural effusions and also bilateral
subsegmental PE.  The patient was seen by cardiology and
pulmonology, and she diuresed adequately, about 7 liters. The
CVP initially was 18 and then improved to 4 this morning.
Despite the significant diuresis, her hypoxia has not improved
much.  She is still on BiPAP and requires 100% F1O2 (down to 50%
at time of transfer). Currently, she is on  Lovenox,
weight-based, twice a day and Coumadin was started for treatment
of her PE.
.
Her CT Chest also showed that she also has somewhat worsening of
air space disease with pneumonia and significant pleural
effusion and signs of congestive heart failure. During her
course, zosyn was added for pneumonia coverage and vancomycin
has been stopped. Again she remains on zosyn alone for
antibiotics upon transfer.
.
On transfer, she has no complaints. She reports her breathing is
"okay," and she is hungry. 30 minutes after arrival, she was
somnolent and ABG showed 7.45/70/94/50 on nasal cannula,
however, she was back to being interactive and asking for food
an hour later with no intervention.
.

progressed to disseminated VZV per [**Hospital1 112**] providers)

tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough or wheezing.

or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or
urgency.

Images:
[**10-13**]: Chest CT
Filling defects are seen in the right upper lobe pulmonary
artery, right middle lobe pulmonary artery and subsegmental
branches of the left lower lobe. Moderate-to-large bilateral
pleural effusions noted. There are air space consolidations
especially in the upper lobes. Similar changes with associated
volume loss noted in the lower lobes along with compressive
atelectasis secondary to the pleural effusions. No definite
adenopathy is seen. Bone windows do not show any suspicious
findings.
.
CONCLUSION: PULMONARY EMBOLI. BILATERAL UPPER LOBE AIR SPACE
CONSOLIDATIONS. CONSOLIDATIONS WITH VOLUME LOSS/ATELECTASIS AT
THE LOWER LOBES BILATERALLY AS WELL AS BILATERAL PLEURAL
EFFUSIONS.
.
Abdominal U/S [**10-13**]
CLINICAL HISTORY: Rule out gallstones/pancreatitis.
FINDINGS: There is a small right pleural effusion. Visualized
image appears normal. Normal gallbladder. No gallstones. No
obvious dilated bile ducts. The pancreatic is slightly
heterogeneous in echotexture but no definite calculi or evidence
for pancreatitis was seen in the visualized portions of the
pancreas. No peripancreatic fluid or pseudocyst identified.
.
CONCLUSION:
EXTREMITY LIMITED EXAMINATION. NORMAL GALLBLADDER. NO
SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITIES ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE PANCREAS BUT THE
ASSESSMENT OF THE PANCREAS IS INCOMPLETELY. IF CLINICAL
SUSPICION FOR PANCREATITIS IS HIGH, CT SCAN IS RECOMMENDED.
