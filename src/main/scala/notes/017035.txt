ulcer healing well.  No bleeding or purulence from any areas.
No significant fluctuance, but both skin graft areas and
surrounding tissue slightly edematous/boggy feeling.

Pertinent Results:
WBCs 20K at [**Hospital1 **] today.

CXR [**2142-11-12**]: moderate-to-large bibasal effusions. There is
atelectasis at the lung bases and superimposed infection cannot
be entirely excluded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. The patient is status post sternotomy.

CXR [**2142-11-14**]: Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater
than right, unchanged. Heart size normal, decreased. Lungs clear
aside from mild left basal atelectasis. No pneumothorax.

TTE [**2142-11-13**]: LVEF 50-55%. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
