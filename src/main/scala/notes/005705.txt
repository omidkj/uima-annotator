Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
SBP, Septic Shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
Temporary HD catheter placement
CVL placement
Multiple paracenteses


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 58F y/o F with a PMH of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS for
refractory ascites with recent revision [**2146-1-28**], on liver
transplant list; CKD, DM, pancytopenia; now transfer from OSH
with ecephalopathy due to SBP and evolving renal failure with
?HRS. Pt now transferred to MICU for worsening AMS.
.
She was admitted to the OSH on [**2146-2-24**] with encephalopathy. An
11 liter paracentesis was performed on [**2-25**]; she was given 25
grams of albumin. Cultures subsequently grew Klebsiella. She was
treated with Ceftriaxone 2g q24 for SBP. Her renal funciton
deteriorated from a Cr of 1.3 on admission to 2.2 on [**2-27**] and
then 2.7 on [**2-28**]. Urine sodium was 5; this was though to be
hepatorenal syndrome. She was given and IVF challenge (NS at 150
cc/hr as well as albumin 50 gram daily), however, her urine
output declined (55 cc's in 8 hours on [**3-2**]) and the IVF
accumulated in her abd.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Liver Service for further care.
.
Of note, she was last admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**1-26**] - [**1-29**] with massive
ascites and underwent paracentesis as well as tevision of her
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).
.
The evening of admission, the pt. triggered for marked nursing
concern related to altered mental status. Labs returned at K 6.3
and HCO3 9 with AG 22. WBC 15. She was given Insulin/D50,
kayexelate PR, and antibiotics broadened to Vanc/Zosyn. ABG
7.22/23/103 Lactate 4.5 Tbili 14.5. Stat abd US was ordered.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is awake but somnolent,
moves ext and groans to verbal and painful stimuli.

IMAGING STUDIES:

[**2146-3-3**] U/S - RUQ - IMPRESSION:
1. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
2. Large volume ascites.
.
[**2146-3-4**] - TTE
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with
preserved free wall motion. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Dynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-7-6**],
the right ventricular cavity now appears dilated with increased
pulmonary artery systolic pressure c/w primary pulmonary
process. The other findings are similar.
.
[**2146-3-4**] - CT abd/pelvis -
IMPRESSION:
1. Large-volume ascites, nonhemorrhagic by density.
2. Cirrhosis.
3. Anasarca.
4. Bibasilar lung consolidation.
5. Small locule of gas adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall
to the left of
midline is likely extraluminal and may relate to recent
paracentesis.
6. Splenomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patien was a 58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD,
c/b temporary respiratory failure, with ascities and abdominal
compartment syndrome s/p paracentesis with SBP who was on vanco,
[**Last Name (un) 2830**], caspofungin until made CMO [**3-25**]. Patient expired [**3-26**] at
0605 hours.

Patient was initially admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and
hepatorenal syndrome requiring dialysis, s/p respiratory failure
(extubated [**3-11**]) and s/p paracentesis complicated by
intraabdominal bleed, awaiting liver/kidney transplant, desated
to day in the setting of unresponsiveness and was transferred to
MICU.

# Hemodynamics/hypotension ?????? Patient was chronically hypotensive
in setting of liver disease and had high cardiac output.  Blood
pressures were monitored through arterial line since patient was
on levophed pressors until was made CMO on [**3-25**]. Blood pressures
were also maintained with albumin (with additional doses after
paracentesis) and small boluses. Lactates were trended as an
indicator of end organ perfusion. Prior to change in code status
to CMO, lactates were climbing despite pressors.

# Leukocytosis ?????? Until made CMO on [**3-25**], patient has worseneing
leukocytosis despite broad coverage with vanco, [**Last Name (un) 2830**],
caspofungin (since [**3-19**]).  Yeast was previously identified in
urine, sputum and skin/ascites prior to transfer to the ICU. SBP
was a documented source of infection, however gram stain was
negative. Another possible soruce was the Left abdominal eschar
that was felt to be infected and was examined by derm and gen
[**Doctor First Name **]. Patient had diagnostic and therapeutic tap on [**3-24**] where
4L removed. SBP diagnosis was made, after correcting for RBCs,
however gram stain negative. ID was consulted in the treatment
of the leukocytosis. The progressive severity of the infection
was influential in hepatology removing her as a transplant
candidate.
