Brief Hospital Course:
60M with Wegener's granulomatosis admitted with respiratory
distress found to have Parainfluenza, now with ARF.
.

# Respiratory distress: The patient was admitted to the ICU with
increased work of breathing, tachycardia and fever. Rapid
respiratory viral screen revealed parainfluenza infection. CT
chest was consistent with bronchiolitis. Given the patient's
history of immunosuppression he was evaluated by the ID service.
Additional workup including cryptococcal antigen, urine
legionella were negative. Glucan and galactomannan were
negative. Sputum culture final pending. He completed a 7 day
course of ceftriaxone/azithro for possible additional CAP given
[**Month (only) **] steroid use. He is continued on expectorants and
nebulizers. Nystatin was initiated prior to discharge for oral
thrush.
.
# Pancytopenia: Patient had a history of pancytopenia, thought
to be due to myelosuppression from cytoxan and possibly Bactrim.
He has an unexplained low CD4 count, most recently *4* on [**11-6**].
 HIV was negative as recently as [**10-5**]. BM biopsy in past w/
normocellular marrow, thought toxin induced suppression.  Rectal
guaiac on admission was negative. He was seen by the heme/onc
service for consideration of eventual repeat BM biopsy if his
counts failed to improve. His bactrim was changed to atovoquone
for PCP prophylaxis and PPI was discontinued.  No further
interventions were made.  The patient should follow up with the
hematology service as an outpatient.
.
# Acute on [**Month/Year (2) 8304**] Renal Failure: The patient had a history of
CKD due to vasculitic renal complications from Wegners/RPGN with
a baseline Cr 2.0-2.3.  On admission, the patient was noted to
have a creatinine of  3.8. The nephrology service was consulted
and the patient was noted to have urine sediment inconclusive
for Wegeners.  It was felt that the patient's renal failure was
more likely ATN related to [**Month/Year (2) **] hypoperfusion with acute
exacerbation in the setting of illness. His renal function
improved mildly with hydration and at the time of discharge, the
patient's  creatinine was 1.8. His lisinopril was restarted on
day of discharge with instructions to stop if creatinine >3, per
renal recommendations.
.
# Wegener's granulomatosis: Had incomplete induction therapy
with Cytoxan (aborted due to side effect), currently on
prednisone 50 daily as outpatient, no current evidence of
wegener??????s flare. He was started on stress dose steroids on
admission to the ICU, which was tapered to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] in the
setting of infection. Renal and rheumatology were consulted.  It
was recommended that azathioprine therapy be considered as an
outpatient. In addtion, TPMT enzyme activity was evaluated and
was normal (19.7 U/mL).
.
# Atrial Filbrillation ?????? Pt initially with RVR in setting of
illness to 130s. He was started on metoprolol 75mg po QID.
Diltiazem 60mg QID added with improved rate control.
.
# Latent Tb: continued INH and pyridoxine
.
# Code: full
.
# Communication: Patient, neice [**Name (NI) 19313**] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79235**]

#Follow-up: appointments have been set up for rheumatology and
renal clinic follow-up.
