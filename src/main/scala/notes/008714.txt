Intra-op echo
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the distal infero and anteroseptal walls. There
is a muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD located in the mid
to distal inferior septum.. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is an
intra-aortic balloon pump catheter well positioned in the
descending thoracic aorta
POSTBYPASS
Left ventricular systolic function remains unchanged compared to
pre-bypass. RV systolic function remains normal. Color flow
Doppler is no longer seen across the interventcicular septum.
The study is otherwise unchanged from pre-bypass.

CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2105-3-24**] 3:22 PM
 [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 73 year old woman with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    evaluate for effusion
Final Report
INDICATION: 73-year-old female post-CABG.
CHEST, AP: Moderate bilateral effusions are likely unchanged,
given
differences in positioning. Mild interstitial edema persists.
Left lower
lobe atelectasis is stable. The right lung is clear. The
cardiomediastinal
and hilar contours have a normal post-CABG appearance. Right
venous
introduction sheath has been removed. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Stable bilateral effusions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 805**] presented to [**Hospital **] hospital with chest paina and
shortness of breath. She was brought emergently to the cardiac
catheterization lab and found to have 3 vessel CAD  wide open
mitral regurgitation and a VSD. She was intubated and an IABP
was placed. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Once at [**Hospital1 18**] she was evaluated by cardiac surgery and brought
to the oerating room for: 1. Coronary artery bypass grafting x3
with a reverse saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the first
obtuse marginal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein graft
from the aorta to the left anterior descending coronary artery;
reverse vein graft from the aorta to the distal right coronary
artery. 2. Repair of postinfarct ventricular septal defect with
a bovine pericardial patch technique ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 84634**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]). Her bypass
time was 144 minutes with a cross clamp of 120 minutes. Please
see OR report for details.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
She was kept sedated on the day of surgerey, on POD1 her IABP
was weaned and removed. Following the removal of the IABP
sedation was stopped, she woke neurologically intact, was weaned
from the ventilator and extubated. Over the next several days
she was weaned from all iv medications, all tubes lines and all
drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocols. On POD4 she
was transferred from the ICU to the stepdown floor for continued
care and recovery. She continued to make slow progress in her
physical activity and on POD6 she was cleared for transfer to
rehabilitation at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Location (un) **].
