History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year old female with dementia, tardive dyskinesia,
schizophrenia, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure
and a history of a GI bleed that now presents with bright red
blood per rectum (BRBPR) x 24 hours. She was transfered here
from a nursing home and admitted to the MICU for hypotension.
She had 3 episodes of brisk BRBPR without hypotension or
tachycardia. (HR 80-90, SBP 130's). A tagged RBC scan showed
bleeding from the Hepatic Flexure. Angio subsequently was
performed demonstrating bleeding from [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of the middle
colic artery feeding the hepatic flexure. This was not embolized
due to the risk of gut ischemia. He was transfered back to the
ICU from Angio. Shortly thereafter, she dropped her pressure to
SBP 50's and became unresponsive. She was volume resusciatated
with 4 Units PRBCs and 3 liters of NS. Her BP responded to the
volume and was 127/47, HR 89.

adrenal insuff., hypothyroidism,
schizophrenia, tardive dyskinesia, TIA (on coumadin), DM, HTN,
CHF, cataracts, venous thrombosis, recent hx of vaginal bleeding

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old woman with h/o dementia, schizophrenia, h/o GI bleed
with profuse bleeding per rectum. 3 point hct drop and positive
bleeding at hepatic flexure on tagged RBC scan.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
embolize source of GI bleeding.
FINAL REPORT.

HISTORY: 73-year-old woman with GI bleed localize to hepatic
flexure on tagged red blood cell scan.

PHYSICIANS: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 26181**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 380**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**], the
attending radiologist, present and supervising during the
procedure.

PROCEDURE: Following written informed consent, the patient was
positioned supine on the angiography table. A preprocedure
timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site.
Standard sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region.
Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.
Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single
wall puncture of the right common femoral artery was performed.
A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the
abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance. Needle was
exchanged for a 5-French introducer sheath, which was attached
to continuous heparinized saline flush. Using a Cobra catheter,
the superior mesenteric artery was selected. Superior mesenteric
arteriography was performed to image the entire superior
mesenteric artery territory. Then, using a 3-French
microcatheter, the right colic and middle colic arteries were
selected and arteriograms were performed of the respective
arteries. In the middle colic artery, the microcatheter was
advanced into a branch of the middle colic artery supplying the
hepatic flexure (third order branch from the aorta) and
arteriography was performed.

Based on the findings of the diagnostic arteriograms, it was
determined that the patient would not be a suitable candidate
for embolization despite the fact that active extravasation of
contrast was seen. All wires, catheters and the sheaths were
removed and hemostasis was ensured with direct manual
compression. The patient was transferred back to the ICU and the
case was discussed with the ICU resident (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and surgery
resident (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9768**].

There were no immediate complications.

FINDINGS: Superior mesenteric arteriography demonstrated patency
of the superior mesenteric artery and its major branches.
Initially, no active bleeding or potential source of bleeding
was identified.

Based on the findings of the nuclear medicine study, selective
arteriography of potential arterial feeders to the hepatic
flexure was performed. Right colic arteriography did not
demonstrate any active extravasation or potential source of
bleeding.

In the course of the procedure, the patient experienced
hematochezia and superior mesenteric arteriography was repeated
without the microcatheter. This demonstrated a source of active
extravasation from the area of the hepatic flexure. As the right
colic arteriography performed immediately previously had not
demonstrated any source of bleeding, middle colic arteriography
was performed. This confirmed that the bleeding arose from a
branch of the middle colic artery supplying the hepatic flexure.
The microcatheter was advanced distally in the middle colic
artery territory and arteriography was repeated, confirming that
this branch was supplying the source of bleeding. However, the
main artery-feeding vessel that was bleeding was too small to
accept the microcatheter. The position in the middle colic
artery branch where the microcatheter was, also supplied several
other small arterial feeders to other parts of the hepatic
flexure without collateral arterial supply from elsewhere in the
middle colic or right colic artery territories. As such, it was
determined that the patient was not a suitable candidate for
embolization, as a large segment of the hepatic flexure would
have undergone ischemia had embolization been performed.

Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
Versed (total 2 mg intravenously) and fentanyl (total of 50 mcg
intravenously) over a total interservice time of two hours
during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were
continuously monitored by the Radiology nursing service. The
patient's heart rate was stable throughout the procedure at
approximately 90 beats per minute.

290 cc of Optiray radiographic contrast was utilized.

IMPRESSION: Active bleeding from a branch of the middle colic
artery. Embolization could not be safely performed.
