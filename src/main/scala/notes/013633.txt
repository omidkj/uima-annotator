Admission Date:  [**2131-5-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-9-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2131-5-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Neonatology
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 43368**] [**Known lastname **] was born at 24-3/7
weeks gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a
29-year-old gravida 1, para 0 (now 1) mother.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her previous medical history was

PRENATAL HISTORY:  Her prenatal history is remarkable for a
subchorionic placental hemorrhage at 15 weeks and some
transient fetal premature atrial contractions.  A fetal
survey at 17 weeks was normal and consistent with dates.  The
mother presented with the spontaneous onset of premature
labor.
Her prenatal screens were blood type B positive, antibody
negative, Rubella immune, rapid plasma reagin nonreactive,
hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and group beta strep
status unknown.

The infant cried vigorously at birth and was intubated in the
delivery room.  Apgar scores were 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5
minutes of age.  The birth weight was 910 g, the birth length
was 34.5 cm, and the head circumference was 23 cm; all at
appropriately the 50th percentile for gestational age.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Admission physical
examination was remarkable for nondysmorphic extremely
preterm infant.  Anterior fontanel was soft and flat, intact
palate.  Noted facial ecchymosis.  Eyes were open.  Moderate
intercostal retractions with spontaneous breaths.  Good
breath sounds bilaterally.  A few scattered coarse crackles.
Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  No murmur.
Well perfused.  The abdomen was soft.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Patent anus.  Normal male genitalia for gestational age.
Testes undescended bilaterally.  Age appropriate tone and
reflexes.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

 1.  RESPIRATORY:  The infant was intubated in the delivery
room.  He weaned successfully to nasopharyngeal continuous
positive airway pressure on day of life 57, and then weaned
to nasal cannula oxygen on day of life 61, and then finally
to room air on day of life 110.

He was treated with caffeine for apnea of prematurity
from day of life 2 until day of life 64.  His last
spontaneous episode of bradycardia occurred on [**2131-8-12**].  His last significant desaturation episode was on
[**8-31**] when he desaturated to the 40s.  This spell was
associated with a feeding.

He was treated with Diuril for chronic lung disease from day
of life 25 to the present time.  His current dose is 120 mg
per day divided into two doses.

He had a left thoracotomy tube placed in the operating room
at the time of his posterior descending artery ligation that
was removed on postoperative day one.  He completed a course
of antibiotics on [**2131-5-22**] for Escherichia coli
pneumonia.

 2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  [**Known lastname 43368**] required dopamine for blood
pressure support soon after admission to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit until day of life two.

He was treated with indomethacin on day of life five for
clinical presentation of a patent ductus arteriosis with
resolution of his symptoms.  Reemergence of the murmur on day
of life 11 prompted surgical ligation of the patent ductus
arteriosis at [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**2131-5-18**].  He has
remained normotensive since the time of surgery.

On [**5-22**], he had a follow-up cardiac echocardiogram which
showed a patent foramen [**Last Name (LF) 43369**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] aneurysm of the septum
primum, and good biventricular function.  He continues to
have an intermittent grade [**12-10**] to 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur.

 3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  Enteral feeds were given
on day of life 15 and advanced to full volume feedings by day
of life 30.  His maximum caloric density was 32 calories per
ounce with added ProMod.  He has been taking all oral
feedings since [**7-31**].

His last set of electrolytes on [**8-31**] were sodium
of 139, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 101, bicarbonate
was 26.  He is receiving supplemental potassium chloride in
conjunction with his Diuril.

A persistent elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
prompted a renal ultrasound on [**2131-5-18**] which
demonstrated bilateral decreased perfusion.  A follow-up
renal ultrasound on [**6-15**] was within normal limits.  He has
had good urine output for the remainder of his
hospitalization.

He is currently taking feedings of Enfamil concentrated to
24 calories by concentration on an ad lib demand schedule.
His discharge weight was 3600 g, discharge length was 47 cm,
and discharge head circumference was 34.75 cm.

 4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  [**Known lastname 43368**] was treated with phototherapy
for hyperbilirubinemia from day of life 1 until day of
life 22.  His peak bilirubin occurred on day of life 8 which
was a total bilirubin of 6 and a direct bilirubin of 0.6.

[**Known lastname 43368**] is status post right inguinal hernia repair at
[**Hospital3 1810**] on [**8-29**].  The Steri-strips to his
right groin are intact without redness or drainage.

 5.  HEMATOLOGY:  [**Known lastname 43368**] has received a total of five
transfusions of packed red blood cells during his Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit course.  His most recent blood
transfusion was on day of life 90.  His last hematocrit on
[**8-31**] was 30.4.  He is receiving iron supplementation.

 6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The infant was started on
ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis
risk factors.  The antibiotics were discontinued after 48
hours, and the blood cultures were negative.  The infant was
clinically well.

On day of life 6, he had a clinical decompensation and was
started ampicillin, gentamicin, and ceftazidime.  He did
complete seven days of gentamicin and ceftazidime for
Escherichia coli pneumonia.

On day of life 19, he again had a clinical decompensation and
was started on vancomycin and gentamicin.  Blood cultures at
that time were positive for group alpha strep, and so he
completed seven days of ampicillin treatment for that.

He remained off antibiotics until day of life 45, when a
clinical presentation of sepsis and was started on vancomycin
and gentamicin.  At that time, his tracheal culture was
positive for Escherichia coli, and he completed seven days of
antibiotic treatment for that.  Blood and cerebrospinal fluid
cultures remained negative from that time period.

On day of life 90, he had an acute increase in his abdominal
girth and a tense abdomen; likely related to atropine drops
he was receiving for his retinopathy or prematurity.  He was
started on vancomycin and gentamicin at that time and
received a 48-hour course.  A complete blood count was
unremarkable, and blood cultures were negative from that time
period.

 7.  NEUROLOGY:  [**Known lastname 43368**] has had six ultrasounds during his
stay in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit.  Ultrasounds on [**5-7**] and [**5-14**] were noted to be normal.  An ultrasound on
[**6-5**] showed mild ventriculomegaly.  A follow-up ultrasound
on [**6-27**] showed a left choroid plexus cyst and ventricular
size in the upper limits of normal.  An ultrasound on
[**7-11**] was read as normal, and a final ultrasound on
[**8-31**] again showed a left choroid plexus cyst.  No
periventricular leukomalacia and a normal ventricular size.

 8.  SENSORY:  A hearing screen was performed with automated
auditory brain stem responses.  [**Known lastname 43368**] passed in both ears.

 9.  OPHTHALMOLOGY:  [**Known lastname 43368**] is status post laser treatment in
both eyes for threshold retinopathy of prematurity.  His last
eye examination on [**9-5**] showed regressed retinopathy of
prematurity.  A follow-up examination is scheduled in three
weeks' time with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36137**] at [**Hospital3 1810**].

10.  PSYCHOSOCIAL:  [**Known lastname 43368**]'s parents are married and they have
been very involved in the infant's care throughout his
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  [**Known lastname 43368**] was stable; tolerating ad lib
demand feeds; on room air without respiratory distress or
decompensation; stable temperature; in open crib.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   Discharge dis
