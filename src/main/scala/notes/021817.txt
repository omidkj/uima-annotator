Date of Birth:   [**2067-11-25**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEUROLOGY
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left frontal cortical bleed

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 67-year-old
right-handed woman who presented to an outside hospital with
right-handed weakness and difficulty speaking.  The history
that the patient was behaving strangely and not speaking
while on the phone with a friend.  [**Name (NI) **] sister went to visit

She was able to stand up with assistance.  The patient was
taken to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital, where a CT scan of her
midline shift.  At that time, the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] to the Neurosurgery
service for further evaluation.  The patient was deemed
nonsurgical, and was transferred to the Neurology service for
further evaluation and monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Asthma, schizophrenia, sleep apnea,
hypothyroidism.

ALLERGIES:   Propoxyphene, tetracycline, amoxicillin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Premarin, Proventil, AeroBid,
Serevent, Zyrtec, Levoxyl, Ativan, Zyprexa, Flovent.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is a nonsmoker.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 99.1, pulse 108, blood
pressure 120/58, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 97%
on 2 liters.  The patient was lying in bed, in no apparent
distress, with her mouth open, tongue constantly moving.  The
lung examination revealed adventitious sounds, however, there
was no wheezing.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, with good bowel
sounds.

NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:  Mental status:  Patient opens eyes
to voice, will grasp hand, will wiggle toes.  The patient was
nonverbal.  Cranial nerves:  Left pupil was 2 mm, right pupil
was 1.5 mm, both of them were reactive.  There was left lid
ptosis.  The face was symmetric.  There was no nystagmus.
The patient blinks to threat bilaterally.  Motor examination
showed spontaneous movement of the left arm.  The patient
moved her left leg and wiggled the toes.  There was tremor on
the left side, with increased tone.  The right side was
hemiplegic.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.  The toe was
upgoing on the right and downgoing on the left.  Sensory:
Examination was not withdrawing to pain on the right side.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, revealed white count of
11.5, with a differential of 79 neutrophils, 13 lymphocytes,
1 atypical cell, 4 monocytes, 1 eosinophil, 2 basophils.
Hematocrit 35, platelet count 353.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium
of 136, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, bicarbonate 22, BUN 12,
creatinine 1.3, glucose 143.  Calcium was 9.6, albumin 3.5,
protein 6.7, bilirubin less than 0.5, alkaline phosphatase
93, ALT 26, AST 7.  CK 48, troponin less than 0.04.

An MRI angiogram of the head was obtained, which showed left
frontoparietal lobe hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema.
There was no evidence of abnormal enhancement.  No other
abnormal areas of enhancement in the brain.  Normal MRA of
the head.  Global hemorrhage could be secondary to the
amyloid angiopathy.  No enhancing lesion is identified.
Follow up examination in eight weeks is recommended.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old
white female without known vascular risk factors, who
suffered a lobar hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal
region.  She does not have a history of hypertension or
diabetes.  The differential for such bleed would include
amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformation or hemorrhage into
cortical infarct.

Initially the patient was observed in the Intensive Care
Unit, where she did well and was transferred to the Neurology
service.  The patient was started on Dilantin, with current
dose being 300 mg by mouth daily at bedtime.  Initially the
patient's blood pressure was controlled with Nipride, with
transfer to Lopressor and Hydralazine to maintain her blood
pressure between 130 and 150 systolic.

The patient initially was fed through a nasogastric tube,
however, following a swallowing evaluation which revealed
microaspirations with thin fluids, however, no aspiration
with nectars or pudding, thick liquids, the patient was
started on pureed diet with nectar thick liquids.

During this hospitalization, the patient's asthma medication
was continued.  She did not require any nebulizer treatments.

Physical examination on discharge was slightly improved, with
the patient following some midline commands and purposeful
movements of her left arm.  The patient remained nonvocal,
with paralysis of her right arm and leg.

The patient is to follow up with our stroke fellow, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 36006**]
[**Name (STitle) 35880**], as well as her primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need
a repeat MRI scan in four to six weeks.  At that time,
angiography could also be performed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Asthma
2.  Schizophrenia
3.  Sleep apnea
4.  Hypothyroidism
5.  Left frontal bleed

every evening, Tylenol 650 mg as needed, Nystatin swish and
swallow 5 cc by mouth four times a day (please stop once
thrush resolves), Premarin 0.9 every morning, Lopressor 50 mg
by mouth three times a day and hold for systolic blood
pressure of less than 130, Hydralazine 20 mg by mouth four
times a day and hold for systolic blood pressure less than
130.

DIET:  Pureed food, thick nectar.
