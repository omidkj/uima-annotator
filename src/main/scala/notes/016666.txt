Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
angio-embolization of colonic bleed

History of Present Illness:
85 year old male with h/o Afib on coumadin transferrd from OSH
with BRBPR.
.
The night PTA went to the BR and noted BRB in the toilet bowel.
Has happened before and resolved, so he didnt call anyone. But
this continued to happen x 5 episodes overnight. At 0500, he
called EMS and went to [**Hospital **] hospital.  Denies CP, SOB off
baseline, lightheadedness, fevers/chills, abd pain, n/v. He only
took 1 dose of advil 5 days ago, otherwise no NSAID use. No
change in coumadin dose over last 6 months.
.
At [**Hospital **] Hospital, vital signs bp 130-140, p 100s a fib
Hct 24, INR 2.8 -> 2U FFP, 2U pRBC -> hct 29.0
Vit K 5 mg, lopressor 25 mg, dig .25 mg
bleeding scan showed bleeding in the R colon
.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for IR embolization.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, found to be in atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular rate 110-130, SBP 120s, Hct 26.0, INR 1.7
Given 1U PRBC with repeat hct right after transfusion 26.5.
.
Patient was taken to angiography suite from the ED for
mesenteric arteriogram and to attempt embolization of bleeding
source. Angiogram found active contrast extravasation in the
area of tortous small vessels in cecum consistent with
angiodyaplasia. The bleeding artery (a small branch of right
colic artery) was embolized with microcoils with good
angiographic results- immediate cessation of bleeding. He was
transferred to the MICU for intensive monitoring.

.
EKG:144, a fib, nl axis, nl interval, incomplete RBBB.
.
CXR [**2-12**]: 1. Probable right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Stable or slightly improved CHF.
.
CT abd [**2-14**]: 1. Findings consistent with early acute
appendicitis.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
.
Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2-19**]:
1) Interval placement of left-sided pacemaker with single lead
terminating in the right ventricle.
2) Interval resolution of right lower lobe consolidation and
congestive heart failure.





Brief Hospital Course:
##GI bleeding-etiology from colonic angiodysplasia/tourtous
vessels. Pt was embolized with a coiled spring by interventional
radiology. His Hct was followed closely and remained stable for
the rest of his hospitaliztion. After talking with GI, it was
felt that he should have an outpatient colonoscopy before
restarting his coumadin. The patient later developed some slight
diarrhea and some MS changes. Surgery was concerned for ischemia
and a CT abd was performed. However, this did not show any
concerning abdominal findings. The pt did not have any pain and
the finding of possible early appendicitis on the CT was felt to
be non-contributory. He will follow up with his PCP who will
arrange this for him. He was also started on protonix.
.
##atrial fibrillation: on admission the pt's rate was high in
the 140's and metoprolol was increased to 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was
well controlled on this regimen initially, however, near the end
of his hospitalization he was seen to have bradycardic episodes
to the 30's with long pauses in ventricular function. He was
changed back to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] but continued to have
bradycardic episodes, and then while walking around the floor,
his HR was seen to go up to the 170's with minimal exertion. He
was asymptomatic during all of these bradycardic and tachycardic
episodes. He was seen by EP and a pacemaker was placed. He
tolerated the procedure well and following this the metoprolol
was increased to 50 [**Hospital1 **]. The pt's BP remained stable and he felt
well. He will follow up with his PCP and with the device clinic
for further titration of metoprolol. He was also maintained on
his outpatient dose of digoxin while in house. Plans for
restarting anti-coagulation are detailed above.
.
## aortic stenosis: a loud AS murmur was heard on exam and the
pt had an echocardiogram which showed valve area of 1.0 cm. The
pt will be followed by his PCP who may wish to refer him to a
further cardiologist for close following of this valve and his
CHF symptoms.
.
##Acute renal failure- the pt had a slight increase in Cr on
admission. This was felt to be likely pre-renal from hypovolemia
from his blood loss. He was given intravascular repletion with
PRBC and NS and Cr improved.
.
##CHF: after he received the blood and NS, the pt had some
crackles on lung exam and JVP was elevated along with LE edema.
He was diuresed with lasix over the next several days and his
breathing improved. On discharge it was felt that the patient
may benefit from being on a daily dose of lasix to keep him from
accumulating more fluid. He was discharged with a prescription
for 40mg po qd and will follow up with his PCP for further
titration of this dose.
.
## COPD: the pt was found to have diffuse wheezes on lung exam.
He was treated with albuterol and atrovent nebs while in house
and improved greatly. When these were changed to MDI's, the pt
had slight return of his wheezing. He was started on Advair and
given a prescription to continue on t
