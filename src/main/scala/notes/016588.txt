History of Present Illness:
84-year old man with a history of atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, CAD, decreased EF, PVD, CKD, and anemia, presented to
[**Hospital3 17921**] Center after mechanical fall. Around 4 AM on

Reports:
Echocardiogram, transthoracic [**2153-10-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Moderate aortic
stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.

CT head w/o contrast [**2153-10-9**] 7:38 a.m.: 1. Extensive
bihemispheric subdural hematoma with hypodense and hyperdense
components, the duration/chronicity of the hematoma cannot be
accurately assessed on the CT study. An MRI, if clinically
indicated, can be done to appropirately date the collections.
Findings are stable since the prior study at OSH.
2. A left frontal lenticular shaped hemorrhage with a
fluid-fluid level, could represent an epidural hematoma, albeit
atypical given location, and lack of fracture.
3. No evidence of intraparenchymal/intraventricular hemorrhage.


CT head w/o contrast [**2153-10-12**]: Overall, minimal change with
redemonstration of extensive bilateral subdural blood.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Subdural hematoma: The patient initially presented to
[**Hospital3 17921**] Center, where he was found to have bilateral
subdural hematoma with no midline shift but with mild uncal
herniation and partial effacement of supracellar cistern. His
INR was >7 at the time. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. In the emergency department, his
anticoagulation was reversed with profilnine 2700 units, 2 units
FFP and 10 mg IV Vitamin K. Hydralazine was used to maintain
SBP<140, along with the patient's home carvedilol, terazosin,
and lisinopril. Carvedilol was later discontinued and metoprolol
initiated in the setting of bradycardia (see below). The patient
was monitored by serial neurologic examination and repeat head
CTs. The patient should remain off of Coumadin for at least 4
weeks, and may NOT restart Coumadin until he has been
reevaluated by neurosurgery. The patient will be reevaluated by
neurosurgery in 4 weeks, at which time he will have repeat head
CT. Per neurosurgery, he could start aspirin or subcutaneous
heparin in 1 week, but only if absolutely required.

2. Sinus bradycardia: In the intensive care unit, the patient
had an episode of bradycardia to 20 while sleeping. Blood
pressure and other VS remained stable. The patient's bradycardia
could be related to carvedilol (which he was taking at his home
dose), to his known subdural hematoma, or possible to sleep
apnea and urinary retention. The cardiology service was
consulted and recommended changing carvedilol to metoprolol. He
was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] who did not recommend pacemaker.

3. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia: After discontinuing
carvedilol, the patient had a 20-beat run of NSVT during which
he was asymptomatic. He was evaluated by cardiology, who
recommended metoprolol and repeat echocardiogram. The
echocardiogram showed systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with
LV EF 30%.

4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient was on warfarin
for PAF. His warfarin was held and his anticoagulation reversed
for subdural hematoma, as above. Per neurosurgery, he needs to
remains off of Coumadin for at least 4 weeks and until
reevaluated by neurosurgery (see above).

5. Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient's
cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiogram, which showed
systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with LV EF 30%. Initially,
he was treated with his home regimen of Coreg and lisinopril,
with furosemide held. On [**2153-10-10**], carvedilol was discontinued
in the setting of sinus bradycardia and metoprolol was
initiated. On [**2153-10-10**], furosemide was resumed at the patient's
home dose of 20 mg PO daily, and lisinopril was uptitrated to 20
mg daily.

6. Foley catheter trauma: Patient had a Foley placed in the
Neuro-ICU. Then he pulled out his Foley catheter on [**2153-10-12**],
resulting in frank macroscopic hematur
