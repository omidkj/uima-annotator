DISCHARGE SUMMARY ADDENDUM:

The remainder of the patient's course is uneventful.  Overall
he did well on the general cardiology floor. His blood
pressure remained tenuous but we gradually increased his ace
inhibitor and added Toprol XL without causing significant
hypotension.  In general, his blood pressure ranged from 85
to 115 systolic over 50 to 70 diastolic.  His heart rate
remained quite fast in the high 80s to low 100s.  He
continued to have a nonproductive cough that he has had since
his pneumonectomy in [**2139**].  He denied any change in his cough
with the addition of ace inhibitor.  He had no recurrent
chest pain during this admission.

Three days before discharge, he had a brief three beat run of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He was asymptomatic
and since there were no recurrent episodes, we did not feel
it necessary to consider Electrophysiology evaluation at this
time.

He will need long term anticoagulation for apical akinesis
with goal INR 2.0 to 3.0.

He was seen by physical therapy who considered him a good
candidate for inpatient cardiac rehabilitation.  This was
amenable to the patient and the patient's son.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To inpatient cardiac rehabilitation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. starting the evening of
discharge.
2.  Lovenox 90 units subcutaneous q12hours until INR between
2.0 to 3.0.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d., hold for systolic blood
pressure less than 85.
5.  Toprol XL 25 mg p.o. q.d., hold for systolic blood
pressure of less than 85 or heart rate less than 60.
6.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Levothyroxine 0.075 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. until [**2161-1-16**].
10. Robitussin DM 10 ccs p.o. q4hours p.r.n. for cough.
11. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n.

Fingerstick blood sugar should be checked before lunch and
before dinner with a regular insulin sliding scale.  Prior to
this admission, it should be noted that he did not receive
any treatment for diabetes mellitus and oral hypoglycemic
should be considered in the future.

DIET:  [**Doctor First Name **] and cardiac.

FOLLOW-UP:  Appointments arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his
primary cardiologist, on [**2161-1-9**], at 9:20 a.m.
