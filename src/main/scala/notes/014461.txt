Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, tachypnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated, CPR, arterial and femoral lines placed

History of Present Illness:
79 yo female with PMH of HOCM, dCHF, PAF, HTN, DM, hx of
mesenteric ischemia [**12-22**] thrombus, chronic LE cellulitis brought
in by assistant with complaints of abd pain, constipation, and
SOB.  There is no further collateral information at this time.
Upon presentation to the ED, she was hypoxic in the 80s,
tachypneic, and tachycardic with preserved BP.  Her mental
status was noted to be below baseline.  She complained of
constipation, dyspnea, and pain in both lower quadrants.  She
was placed on a facemask, but became tachypneic to 44 and was
intubated.  She also had a fever to 101F rectal, a right lung
opacity, and pyuria by UA. She was given vanc, CTX, as well as
flagyl (because of her abd pain).  She had a mild leukocytosis
and her lactate was 2.4.  A CT abd had no acute abd findings but
showed a 1.5 cm thrombus in her left atrium.  She was given [**12-24**]
L IVF, continued to be tachy (intermittent afib/sinus tach) but
her she was not hypotensive and required no pressors.

.
[**2132-9-28**] CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis: There is a very small focal
diplaced intimal calcification noted in the proximal abdominal
aorta at the level of the celiac axis. In retrospect it was
present on the prior and may reflect a tiny thrombosed
dissection or penetrating atheromatous ulcer. No evidence of
mesenteric ischemia. Normally appearing colon. Thrombosed
anterior division of left internal iliac artery of unknown
chronicity.
2. 1.5 cm filling defect/thrombus in the left atrium.
Echocardiogram recomended.
3. Unchanged appearance of the 1.9 cm left adrenal lesion,
consistent with adenoma.
4. Ovaries prominent bilaterally, right greater than left.
Nonemergent
evaluation with pelvic ultrasound is suggested given age of
patient.
5. Bilateral changes at the lung bases, concerning for an
infectious process versus aspiration. Correlate clinically.
6. Small pericardial effusion.
7. Fat attenuation liver lesion (lipoma), stable from the prior
study.
.
[**2132-9-29**] TT Echo: Large left atrial appendage thrombus extending
into the left atrium. Small vegetation on the aortic valve.
Diffuse complex atheroma in the aorta.
.
[**2132-9-29**] Head CT: 1. No fracture, hemorrhage, or edema. 2.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 3. No significant change
since [**2132-5-3**].
.
[**2132-9-30**] CT Chest, Abd, Pelvis (prelim read): PFI: CHF and small
bilateral pleural effusion. No PE. Suboptimal evaluation of the
aorta, with most likely mixing of contrast in the aortic arch,
though dissection cannot entirely be excluded. Poor
opacification of the celiac axis and distal SMA. Patent proximal
common femoral arteries. Secondary signs of mesenteric ischemia


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94057**] was admitted to the MICU with hypoxia and tachypnea
and a CXR which showed pneumonia.  She was intubated for
respiratory failure and was started on broad-spectrum
antibtiotics, vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin. Preliminary
head CT showed no abnormalities.  Preliminary abdominal CT
showed no mesenteric ischemia.  An echocardiogram showed a left
atrium thrombus and aortic valve vegetation. She had a history
of cardiac thrombus and was taking coumadin and was
supratherapeutic on admission.  Heparin was started on
admission.
.
On the morning of [**2132-9-30**], at approximatley 5am, the pt
suffered a PEA cardiac arrest. CPR was initiated and she
converted to VT, for which she was shocked.  She was then in a
paced rhythm.  She was started on Levophed and neosynephrine for
hypotension.  She had evidence of lactic acidosis with shock
liver and renal failure after the code.  A repeat CTA showed no
PE.  A head CT showed no hemorrhage.  An abdominal CT showed
early signs of mesenteric ischemia.  Vascular surgery and
general surgery were both consulted.  The patient's primary
cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] was consulted as well and described to
the patient's family the irreversible nature of her cardiac
compromise.  The patient continued to decline and at 10pm, a
family meeting was held.  The family wished to change her code
status to DNR/DNI given her poor prognosis and extensive
illness.  She was made CMO and pressors were stopped.  She was
extubated and died within minutes.
