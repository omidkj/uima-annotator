Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from OSH, intubated and sedated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 79 y/o woman with a prior hx of HTN, DM,
hypothyroidism who comes in as an OSH transfer intubated with
left thalamic IPH.  She was stated to be in her normal state of
health until about 3 weeks ago when after a friends death she
was
noted to have bouts of confusion and a glossy look. She has been
evaluated at [**Hospital **] hospital for this several times including
an
inpatient admission for several days. I have no official reports
from Beverely as of yet but per her daughter she states that
they
were working her up for "inflammation" possibly of the thalamus
(unknown which side) They completed about 3 MRI's some of them
with contrast and an LP was the next thing to be done.
Unfortunately they were unable to provide much more medical
history with regards to this. What family did notice was that
she
was confused at times, would answer questions inappropriately at
times and had a glossy look at times. There were no abnormal
movements noted. Today she stayed in bed past her usual time and
when she got up she was noted to be very lethargic. The daughter
also noted that she was more confused. Having had her atenolol
recently changed she thought it was low blood sugar but her
neighbor measure her bP noting SBP in the 140's and a normal
blood sugar level. In the later afternoon she was given liquids
and vomited it up. She also had fecal incontinence. Ambulance
was
called and she was taken to an OSH ED. There she was lethargic
was intubated for airway protection using fentanyl, Etomidate,
vec and suc's. She had a CT scan and unfortunately we do not
have
today's images but the read stated a left thalamic bleed with
early vasogenic edema measuring 2cm with IV extension.
At the times of exam she was intubated and on sedation.

Microbiology:
Blood cultures x 2, [**2110-10-21**]: Negative
Sputum culture, [**2110-10-25**]: Coag positive staph
BAL culture, [**2110-10-25**]: Oxacillin sensitive staph aureus
Urine cultures, [**2110-10-25**]: Negative
Blood cultures x 2, 9/[**Telephone/Fax (1) 91561**]: Negative
MRSA Screen: [**2110-10-27**]: Negative

Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 75%). with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.

MRA/MRI/MRV: Stable foci of hemorrhage in the left thalamus and
right frontoparietal lobe. Abnormal signal in the right thalamus
has progressed since the MRI from [**2110-10-4**].

There is poor visualization of the straight sinus and the
internal cerebral veins. These findings are concerning for
cerebral [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease.

CTV: Occlusion of the straight sinus and distal vein of [**Male First Name (un) 2096**].
Unchanged
bilateral thalamic edema with left thalamic hemorrhage with
intraventricular extension, and right posterior parietal deep
white matter hemorrhage likely secondary to venous sinus
thrombosis. Nonocclusive thrombus in the superior sagittal
sinus.

CT Torso:  Focal saccular aneurysmal dilatation of the mid
descending thoracic aorta measuring 3.2 x 2.3 x 6.0 cm. Hematoma
within the superior aspect of the aneurysm sac. Endotracheal
tube tip at the level of the carina pointing towards the right
mainstem bronchus. Hypoattenuating lesion in the caudate lobe,
likely a simple cyst but with mixed attenuation values likely
due to its small size. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute
cholecystitis.

CXR [**2110-11-4**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. No evidence of pneumonia. Borderline size of the cardiac
silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pulmonary
edema. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 91562**] was admitted to the ICU approximately 12 days prior
following being transferred from an OSH, intubated for
"lethargy". Prior to this event, her family describes a course
of 3 weeks during which she would have intermittent periods of
confusion and a "glossy look". She was admitted to an OSH
briefly on [**9-15**] for five days when a series of tests were
performed to identify the source of her AMS. During this stay,
her mental status improved. They identified an area of thalamic
"inflammation" for which she was finally discharged and was
being worked up as an outpatient. She received two more CT scans
and at least one more MRI and family reports that
