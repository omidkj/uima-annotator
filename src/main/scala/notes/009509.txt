52 YO female with Hx of diastolic CHF, A fib, COPD admitted with
shortness of breath which has improved, attempted chemical
cardioversion to SR with propafenone.
.

[**1-24**] --> [**1-25**] still in AF 80s. [**2205-1-27**] - DCCV after 3 days of

rate controlled. She was discharged on amlodipine and Coreg. She
will follow-up with EP as an out-pt.
