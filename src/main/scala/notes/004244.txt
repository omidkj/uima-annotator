    mammary to left anterior descending coronary artery;
    reverse saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to
    the first obtuse marginal coronary artery; reverse
    saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to second
    obtuse marginal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein
    single graft from the aorta to the distal right coronary
    artery.

History of Present Illness:
76 year old female with multiple
problems CAD w/ MI [**2148**] (medically managed), HTN,
Hyperlipidemia,
DM, paroxysmal AF on coumadin, and cerebrovascular disease s/p
CVA*2 who presented with nearly 24 hours of chest pressure.

She reports this pain started on the evening prior to
presentation when she noted substernal chest pressure radiating
down her left arm starting while she was cooking dinner. This
was
associated with dyspnea and some diaphoresis but the pain was
relatively mild so she managed to finish her dinner and go sit
down in front of the TV where she continued to have pain. She
reports she fell asleep with this pain so it is impossible to
assess just how long it lasted. She awoke the next morning pain
free but reports recurrent pain after walking back to the house
after trying to start her car. This was associated with dyspnea,
diaphoresis, and nausea and she reports vomiting once. All told
her symptoms lasted about 30 minutes. She then went into her
regularly scheduled PCP appointment and was sent directly to the
ED from there for further evaluation.

She had a cardaic cath on [**2156-1-22**] at [**Hospital1 18**] which revealed severe
CAD.  She was referred for surgical revascularization.  She has
undergone a coumadin washout and is admitted preoperatively for
heparin drip.

Intra-op TEE [**2156-1-29**]
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s).

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no obvious wall motion abnormalities. The LV walls
appear to be thick, although this appearance may be secondary to
small chamber size.

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with focal
calcifications but aortic stenosis is not present. The right
coronary cusp mobility appears mildly restricted. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.

There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate MAC, most notably in
the posterior annulus.

POST-CPB:
The LV systolic function appears normal, estimated EF=55%. There
are no obvious wall motion abnormalities. The chamber size is
small, most likely reflective of relative hypovolemia. The walls
again appear thick.

RV systolic function appears normal. There is mild TR.

The LAA is no longer seen, c/w LAA ligation.

There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results at time of
study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2156-1-29**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 4 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  Creatinine trended up to 2.4, indicating acute
kidney injury without oliguria.  Lasix was held, and creatinine
would trend down prior to discharge.  The patient was evaluated
by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was
ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
[**Hospital3 41599**] and Rehab in [**Location 1268**] in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
