Pertinent Results:
CTA-Chest([**5-7**]): CT CHEST: Extensive pulmonary emboli are
identified in the right and left pulmonary arteries extending
into all lobar branches (saddle), branching into many segmental
and subsegmental braches. The interventricular septum is
somewhat flattened. The main pulmonary artery is prominent,
measuring 3.6 cm (3:31), and is suggestive of pulmonary
hypertension. The heart, aorta, and coronary arteries are
otherwise unremarkable in appearance. Non- pathologically
enlarged nodes are identified in the prevascular, AP window, and
pretracheal locations. There is no supraclavicular or axillary
lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear, with no pleural effusion,
consolidation, or nodular opacity.

A right suprarenal hypodensity is incompletely imaged.
Incidental note is made of DISH of the thoracic spine, primarily
on the right side.

ECG Study Date of [**2131-5-7**]  10:32:40 AM
Sinus rhythm. Modest intraventricular conduction delay - may be
in part right ventricular conduction delay Since previous
tracing of [**2131-4-11**], no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted s/p an elective re-do laminectomy on
[**2131-5-4**]. He was starting to mobilize and worked with PT on [**5-7**].
At that time he had a desaturation and was found to have
bilateral pulmonary emboli. He was transferred to the SICU and
started on a heparin drip. The following day he was transferred
back to the step-down unti after a stable night. He continued to
work with PT on a daily basis and they felt that he would not
require rehab.

The patient's PTT was monitored and the heparin drip was
adjusted accordingly Q 6 hours. Coumadin was started on [**2131-5-11**]
at a dose of 7.5 mg. His INR was monitored and it was 2.0 on
[**2131-5-13**]. The heparin drip was then stopped. His is being
discharged on 10mg daily on M,W, Fri; with instructions to take
7.5mg on Tues, Thurs, Sat, Sun. He was given instructions to
