Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, hypoxia and pleuritic chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 56 y/o male with coronary artery disease s/p LAD stent
placement, IDDM, and tracheomalacia s/p tracheal stent, who
presented to the ED after 5 days of progressive shortness of
breath and cough.  His symptoms first developed 5 days ago as
progressive SOB (can walk 2 flights of stairs at baseline, then
down to 1/2 flight), cough productive of yellow and pink tinged
sputum, and pleuritic right-sided chest pain, rated [**2108-7-9**].  The
pain was present all of the time and worse with coughing or
movement. He also began using home O2 that he does not normally
require. In addition he complained of increasing bilateral lower
extremity edema and increasing abdominal girth. He called his
primary care physician and was told to take extra lasix
(apparently up to 240mg daily per patient report) without
success. He then presented to an episodic visit yesterday where
a chest xray showed a new right upper lobe pneumonia. He was
hypoxic (87% on RA) in clinic and he was referred to the ED for
further evaluation.  He denies any recent sick contacts,
antibiotic exposure, or travel.  He has had no chest pain,
fever, chills, night sweats, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bright
red blood per rectum, melena, or rash.  He denies orthopnea or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

Of note, patient was pushed down a flight of stairs in spring
[**2104**], and he sustained multiple rib fractures and continues to
experience low back pain. In the ED, his BLE edema was evaluated
with LENIs which showed no evidence of DVT. Initial O2 Sat in
the ED was 90% on 4L NC.He was also given levofloxacin for
pneumonia prior to being admitted to the floor. On exam he was
resting and talking comfortably in bed with mild wheezing and
productive cough. Cough and small movements elicited extreme
pain.

The pt was scheduled to get a CTA on his first night. He was
sitting watching television  and had sudden onset worsening of
his right pleuritic chest pain. He got up to try to walk it off
but as he walked he developed a tightening/pressure sensation in
his mid-abdomen which then moved up towards his chest and
ultimately developed acute "throat-closing" sensation. He called
the nurse and was found to be 83% 6L NC. He was acutely short of
breath and had difficulty speaking. He was most comfortable in a
standing position. Initial SBP 170s. He was given 2 mg IV
Morphine, 2 SL NTG, 125 solumedrol, combivent neb, 20 mg Lasix
and was started on heparin IV with initial bolus, empirically.
Pt was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress and
hypoxia. He responded to 97% on 5L at transfer to the MICU.

When transferring from the stretcher to the bed, the patient
again had an acute shortness of breath with pressure in his
chest and a throat-closing sensation. He responded to standing
and slow deep breathing after approximately 1 minute. The pt was
started on Heparin drip empirically for presumed PE and
vancoymcin was added to antibiotic regimen. CTA the next day did
not show evidence of PE, hypoxia was resolved, and patient was
transferred back to medicine floor.
