hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVL insertion
Mechanical Intubation
Bronchoscopy with BAL
OG tube insertion
[**First Name3 (LF) 2793**] replacement therapy

History of Present Illness:
50 yo M with mixed connective tissue/vasculitis with history of
pulmonary hemorrhage and lupus nephritis currently being
treating with prednisone and cytoxan who presented to OSH
complaining of [**3-13**] days of worsening SOB.  Per report, the
patient had no recent fevers, wheezing, coughing, chest pain or
nausea but did complain of worsening LE edema.  In the ED there
he was hypoxic to 76% on RA, RR37, HR 130s, BP 94/65.  He was
placed on NRP and O2 Sat improved to 88% but he continued to
appear cyanotic.  He was emergently intubated and intial ABG
following intubation was 7.34/32.6/48.6. He was given 80 IV
lasix, hydrocortisone 100, phenylephrine 50 mg IV push x 2,
ketamine 100 mg IV, Succinylcholine 150 IV, and vecuronium 10 mg
IV.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where he receives the majority
of his care.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient's intial vitals were HR
132, BP 109/67, RR 22, SaO2 98%.  Initial ABG on 100% FiO2 was
7.14/54/85/19.  Labs were notable for WBC of 19.9 with a left
shift (11% bands), Hct 31.1 (range in OMR 28-36), Cr of 2.5 from
baseline 1.0, and lactate 1.0. Blood and urine cultures were
sent, and he was given 2L NS, vanco 1 g IV, zosyn 4.5 mg IV.  He
was initially started on propofol drip but then changed to
fentanyl/versed drip. CXR showed multifocal bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates, and ventilator settings changed to ardsnet protocol
and admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was hypotensive to 80s/60s, HR
120-130s, SaO2 92%, and appeared dyssynchronous with the
ventilor.  He was started on peripheral neosynephrine and
paralyzed with vecuronium.
.
Notably, patient had a recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission for hemoptysis
([**Date range (1) 41780**]).  During that admission, he had a cavitaory LUL
lesion for which extensive testing failed to identify specific
diagnosis.  During that admission, he had a CT scan, was ruled
out for TB with multiple sputum tests and serologic sputum
testing for Nocardia histo, coccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis
were all negative. He did have an "indeterminate" quantiferon
test at that time, of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 41781**], and has several AFB
cultures still pending currently (from [**8-27**], [**8-28**], [**8-29**]).  ANCA
testing was negative and lung biopsy was considered and
discussed but not done.

status post four plasmapheresis sessions in [**2136**].
- Bilateral hip avascular necrosis in the setting of steroid

-Hypertension
-Hypogonadism
-IV-G V lupus nephritis and class V membranous nephritis with
[**Year (4 digits) **] impairment, high-grade proteinuria and nephrosis --
currently receiving cytoxan/mesna monthly, has received 5
cycles, last dose 9/3
-cavitary LUL lesion with extensive ID workup neg except for
indeterminate quantiferon test


Social History:
He denies cigarette use and uses alcohol very rarely. He denies
any recent history of cocaine, IV drug, or marijuana use.


Family History:
His sister also has an undiagnosed autoimmune condition,
currently in remission. He denies any history of diabetes,
hypertension, or kidney disease in the family.

Pertinent Results:
CT head:
1. Hemorrhagic transformation of the previously seen right MCA
and PCA territorial infarct with significant mass effect causing
uncal and subfalcine herniation.
2. New right thalamic infarct.
3. Mass effect effacement of ipsilateral right lateral
ventricles with trapping of the left lateral ventricles.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo M with history of vasculitis including prior pulmonary
hemorrhage and lupus nephritis being treated with prednisone and
cytoxan who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2143-10-23**] with hypoxic
respiratory failure and shock.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory failure: The differential diagnosis for
acute respiratory failure in this significantly
immunocompromised patient included bacterial infection,
fungal/PCP infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, cytoxan-induced
pneumonitis.  ID, Rheum, and Nephrology were consulted.  The
patient was intubated and had an esophageal balloon for
transplerual pressure monitoring placed.  Rheum thought that a
vasculitic process was unlikely given that the patient was on
cytoxan and prednisone as an outpatient and there was no benefit
from plasmapheresis.  He was treated with pulse steroids for 4
days, then tapered back to a standing dose of prednisone, which
was later discontinued.  [**Date Range 2793**] initiated CVVH given the
[**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and tenuous clinical picture, and this was later
discontinued as his [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] function improved.  Per ID, the
patient was initially started on vancomycin, meropenem, IV
bactrim, ambisome, and ciprofloxacin.  Cultures and studies to
look for CMV, crypto, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 41783**], and fungi were sent.  A
sputum culture grew back yeast and mold - later identified as
zygomycetes/cunninghamella and aspergillus.
.
# Stroke:  As Mr. [**Known lastname 41769**] was weaned from sedation, it was
noted that his mental status did not improve as expected.  Head
CT showed a large right MCA and PCA stroke, which was later
better characterized with MRI.  Stroke team was consulted and
provided prognostic information to the family regarding the
deficits Mr. [**Known lastname 41769**] could expect if he recovered from his
acute illness.  On [**2143-11-4**], he was noted to have a blown pupil,
and repeat head CT showed hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke
with uncal and subfalcine herniation.
.
# Tachycardia/Hypertension - This was thought to be in part from
benzo withdrawal and also from heart failure.  An echo obtained
on admission showed an EF of 20-25% with moderate to severe MR.
The patient was diuresed with CVVH as above with improvement in
his hypoxia.  However, he remained tachycardic and hypertensive.
 His benzo withdrawal was treated as above, and he was given
some flu
