History of Present Illness:
This is a 84 y/o with h/o AVR, CHF, pAF, h/o LGIB, who complains
of progressive SOB x 1 mo. Presently, she is SOB even at rest.
No CP, N/V associated with this SOB. She has also been very
fatigued for about one year. She endorses orthopnea, PND and occ
LE edema. She has been having black stools recently and reports
diarrhea after eating since her last intestinal operation
(unclear date). She reports a 20 lb weight loss in the last five
months. She has had decreased appetite over this time period.
She has not been ambulating over the last few days [**12-29**] fatigue
but normaly walks independently and can climb stairs.
.
Of note, one mo ago the pt was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] for virus and
periph edema and then was sent to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from there.
.
In the ED, noted to have: AF, BP 122/59 HR 75 RR 16, sats 91-98
RA, 100 on 4 L NC. CXR consistent with
effusion/collapse/consolidation wet read per radiology. HCT 23,
unknown baseline. ED called up to floor that pt. was guaiac
negative, but it is not documented anywhere in ED paperwork. On

CXR ([**1-13**]):
1.  Cardiomegaly, with slight upper zone redistribution, but no
overt CHF.
2.  Prosthetic ball and cage type valve noted.
3.  Opacification at right base consistent with right lower lobe
collapse
and/or consolidation and effusion.

Echo ([**1-17**]):
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is mild global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. A
"ball-and-cage" type aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic aortic leaflets appear normal.The transaortic
gradient is top normal for this prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic
deformity. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is moderate mitral
stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR ([**1-18**]):
There has been  interval increase in moderate right pleural
effusion
with increase in right lower and right middle lobe atelectasis.
Left lower
lobe retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis is new.
There is no
overt CHF. ETT tip is 3.9 cm above the carina. Unchanged
calcified granuloma is in the left upper lobe. There is no
pneumothorax. The patient is post median sternotomy and valve
replacement. There is no overt CHF.

CT Chest ([**1-18**]):
1.  Right lower lobe atelectasis surrounded by moderate sized
simple right
pleural effusion.  Ground glass opacities within the lingula are
likely
related to pulmonary edema.
2.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly with
biatrial enlargement and RV failure, and 5cm ascending aorta
dilatation.  Mild dilatation to main pulmonary artery suggestive
of underlying pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Unchanged appearance to appropriately positioned
endotracheal tube and
malpositioned left-sided PICC catheter with tip in unclear
location and
possibly extravascular.

CXR ([**1-20**]): Bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right than
the left and unchanged. CHF, unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y/o with hx of AVR, CHF, pAF, h/o LGIB, who complains of
progressive SOB x 1 mo, found to have possible RLL PNA and GIB
with an INR of 3.4 on warfarin and a greater than 10 point
hematocrit drop from baseline.

# GIB: On admission the patient was found to have a GIB with
guaiac + brown stool and a Hct 23 from a baseline of about 30
per [**Hospital1 2025**] records. She received a total of three units PRBC from
[**Date range (1) 71723**] with a Hct stable between 27-29. She was started on
protonix IV BID and her Hct was checked Q4 hrs. She continued to
have melena with one episode of BRBPR. GI was following the
patient and recommended letting her INR drift down from 3.4 on
admission. They advised a heparin bridge once her INR was <1.5.
The plan was to scope her when her INR<1.5. She completed 4L
golytely without worsening of her black tarry stool. She
received 2u FFP on the morning of [**5-18**]. After the first unit had
infused, the patient became tachypneic and hypoxic with Sa02 in
the low 70s and had rigors and diffuse wheezes/crackles on lung
exam. She was given IV methylprednisolone and diphenhydramine
for presumed transfusion rxn, furosemide for volume overload and
was intubated. She was th
