coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90583**] is a 71 year-old lady with a past medical history of
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity
presenting from PCP's office after a syncopal episode/Code blue
event, found to have inferior STEMI, now s/p 1 DES to mid-RCA
for 90% occlusion.  At her PCP's office, the patient had
apparently been complaining of nausea and lightheadedness prior
to the episode.  Per Atrius note, patient was sitting in the
waiting room and slumped over in her chair, witnessed by MA.
Patient was unresponsive and had "no heart rate."  Chest
compressions were started, code was called.  Pads were placed,
heart rate 114 in atrial fibrillation, patient spontaneously
regained conciousness, was alert and oriented.  She was given
ASA 325 mg.
.
At 14:40, while en route to [**Hospital1 18**] with EMS, EKG showed ST
elevations in II, III, aVF and V3-V6, with reciprocal
depressions in I and aVL.  On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED at 14:57,
initial EKG had similar findings also with Q waves ST depression
in V2.  Patient was taken to the Cath Lab, where initial vital
signs were BP 149/114 HR 40s RR 20 SaO2 96% 2L.  FSBS was noted
to be in the 500s.  Access was attempted through RFA and RRA,
and eventually gained through LFA at 15:42.  She was found to
have a mid-LAD elsion of 50-60% with extension into the diagnoal
branch and TIMI 3 flow into the distal LAD, LCx with moderate
luminal irregularities in the mid-vessel, and a calcified RCA
with 90% stenosis, which was stented with 1 DES.  For her
bradycardia during the procedure, a temp wire was placed at the
RV apex and paced 70 bpm, and for her hypotension, dopamine drip
was started at 5-15 mcg/kg/min.
.
On arrival to the CCU, initial vital signs were 96.2 101/58 127
36 86%.  The patient was agitated and turning cyanotic.  She was
minimally responsive with sats in the 60-70%s.  She was bagged.
Femoral and carotid pulse were not palpable.  One chest
compression was attempted and she bolted upright in bed.
Subsequent vital signs were 95/42 113 33 100% 2L.
.
Of note, patient had been discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] with bilateral
cellulitis and acute renal failure.  On discharge, her
lisinopril, lasix, and atenolol had been held.  Lisinopril and
Lasix were restarted on [**8-16**], but atenolol was still held.
Additionally, she was noted to have a rash that was hypothesized
to be secondary to antibiotics.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations.

Imaging:
[**2143-8-28**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed
one-vessel disease. The LMCa had no angiographically apparent
disease.
The LAD had a 50-60% stenosis in the mid vessel and a large
diagonal
branch had an ostial 50-60% stenosis. The LCx had moderate
luminal
irregularities. The RCA was calcified and had a distal hazy 90%
stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left- and
right-sided
filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 15 mm Hg and a PCWP of 18 mm
Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension,
with a
PASP of 50 mm Hg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.7
L/min/m2. There
was no gradient upon pullback of the catheter from the lef
