Chief Complaint: melena, hematemesis, acute renal failure

Reason for MICU transfer: massive GI bleed, hypoxic resp failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy with banding of bleeding vessels


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 111791**] is a 65 yo M with h/o EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and ?CHF
one year ago in setting of AFib (on Coumadin) who is transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital6 3105**] for hematemesis and
melena. He initially presented to LGH on [**2158-7-2**] c/o two days of
melena progressing to bright red hematemesis this morning. On
arrival to LGH his HCT was 23, INR 8.9, and SBP was 60. He
received 2 units RBC, 4 units FFP, 10 units vitamin K, and
octreotide. Had EGD at LGH which showed large nonbleeding
esophageal varices, gastric fundus obscured by blood clot. No
intervention was performed. After EGD he was hypoxic and was
intubated with fentanyl/versed for airway protection; sats
improved s/p intubation. He was MedFlighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care including [**Last Name (un) **]. Paralyzed with Pancuronium during
transport.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient was noted to have
significant ascites. NGT was placed, no active bleeding. Labs
notable for HCT 30.2, INR 2.3, lactate 1.7, Cr 4.1, trop 0.03,
ABG 7.39/40/304/25. Patient received another 1 unit RBC, started
octreotide and pantoprazole (bolus + gtt) and ceftriaxone.
Continued sedation with fent/midaz. His MAPs were stable in 70s
while in ED, but minimal UOP (80cc). He was seen by hepatology
in ED who recommended deferring EGD until tomorrow, erythromycin
to clear blood from stomach, maintaining MAPs ~70 to balance
prevention of portal hypertensive bleeding with end-organ
perfusion (given high Cr). Has 4 PIVs (16g, 18g, 20g, 22g). Vent
settings on transfer: FiO2 50%, TV 478, rate 18, PEEP 5. Vitals
prior to transfer: 96/65 71 18 100%.
.
On arrival to the MICU, vitals were: 72 115/70 (MAP 79) 14 100%.
Pt was intubated and sedated. He had massive tense ascites. A
repeat endoscopy at [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated grade III varices in
lower third of esophagus, three of which were banded.  Patient's
last transfusion was on the 20th and his hct has been stable
around 39.

The patient's course was complicated by ATN thought to be
secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of UGIB.  Renal team
evaluated in MICU and determined there were muddy casts on UA.
The patient was started on HD on [**7-4**] after temporary line was
placed.

While in the MICU, the team was able to wean the patient from
the ventilator and was extubated on [**7-7**].  With regard to
cirrhosis, patient underwent a paracentesis in MICU where 4.5L
were removed.  SAAG of 2.2, protein of 1.4, sterile fluid.

Finally, the patient had two episodes of R arm, shoulder, leg
shakiness for a few minutes in the MICU. These episodes resolved
spontaneously.  He was given 1mg IV ativan, q4h prn agitation to
cover for alcohol withdrawal. An EEG was slow, encephalopathic,
L hemisphere with sharp waves in arrhythmic waves, might have
been pre-seizure activity, focus still active! An MRI
demonstrated global cerebral atrophy, but no evidence of acute
intracranial abnormality such as hemorrhage, infarct or mass. An
unclear lesion at the superior-anterior aspect of the clivus was
noted which could be related to the sphenoid sinus, although a
lytic lesion in the clivus was not entirely excluded. A repeat
EEG on [**7-7**] had normalized. Neurology signed off of the patient.

Past Medical History:

-PUD


Social History:
Significant EtOH abuse, currently has 3 hard liquor drinks
daily, previous history of 6 beers/day. Denies history of
withdrawal or DTs. Lives in upstate [**State 531**], in MA for the
summer.  Lives with fiance. In touch with family including son.
Denies current tobacco use, quit 20 years ago, 15 years X 3
cigs/day.

EGD - found grade 3 esophageal varices s/p 3 bands.

TE [**2158-7-3**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion

RUQ u/s
1.  Patent, hepatopetal main portal vein.
2.  Large volume ascites.
3.  Cholelithiasis.
.
MRI:
1. Global cerebral atrophy, but no evidence of acute
intracranial abnormality such as hemorrhage, infarct or mass.
Dedicated seizure protocol MRI can be considered if clinically
indicated.
2. Unclear lesion at the superior-anterior aspect of the clivus
which could be related to the sphenoid sinus, although a lytic
lesion in the clivus is not entirely excluded . CT can be
considered for further characterization.
.
EEG: [**2158-7-5**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The
background was slow with bursts of generalized slowing
throughout. This
indicates a widespread encephalopathy. There were several left
occipital sharp waves on the isolated recording just after
midnight on
the 21st, but these did not appear again later in the longer EEG

monitoring. There were no definitely epileptiform features, and
there
were no electrographic seizures. The slow background indicates
encephalopathy, but the slowing was not as profound (and without
typical
"triphasic" waves) as seen typically in hepatic encephalopathy.
This
raises the possibility of a contribution from medications.
