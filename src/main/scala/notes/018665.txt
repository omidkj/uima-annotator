Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2101-1-14**] Mitral Valve Replacement utilizing a 33 millimeter CE
Perimount Mitral Bioprosthetic Valve


History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 year old male with known mitral regurgitation and
dilated cardiomyopathy. He also suffers from chronic atrial
fibrillation. He complains of worsening fatigue and shortness of
breath. Cardiac catheterization in [**2100-11-21**] confirmed 3+
mitral regurgitation and an LVEF of 35%. Coronary angiography
showed no flow limiting disease. His most recent ECHO was from
[**2100-5-21**] which revealed moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency, and an LVEF of 45%.
Based on the above results, he was referred for cardiac surgical
intervention. He will be admitted for reversal of Warfarin and
heparinization.

Mitral regurgitation, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Congestive Heart
Failure, History of Myocardial Infarction, Chronic Atrial
Fibrillation, Hyperlipidemia, History of Cerebrovascular
Accident, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Testicular Tumor - s/p
Orchiectomy, s/p Right Shoulder Surgery


Social History:
Lives with wife. Retired chief probation officer. Denies
tobacco. Occasional EtOH - averges out to one drink a day.


Family History:
No premature CAD. Brother and mother died of MI in their 70's.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 95715**] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation. He was concomitantly heparinized for his chronic
atrial fibrillation. Workup was otherwise unremarkable and he
was cleared for surgery. On [**1-14**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]
performed a mitral valve replacement utilizing a 33 millimeter
CE perimount mitral bioprosthetic valve. The operation was
uneventful and he transferred to the CSRU in stable condition.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He initially required atrial pacing for an underlying
junctional rhythm. He otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics
and successfully weaned from inotropic support. Over several
days, his native heart rate improved and low dose beta blockade
was resumed. Given his bradycardia and long standing history of
atrial fibrillation, Amiodarone was not recommended. He was
noted to have a slight decline in renal function but continued
to maintain adequate urine output. His creatinine peaked to 2.0
on postoperative day four. Diuretics were titrated accordingly.
His CSRU course was otherwise uneventful and he transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day five. His renal function continued
to improve. Warfarin was dosed daily for a goal INR between [**12-24**].
He transiently required Heparin for a subtherapeutic prothrombin
time. Over several days, he continued to make clinical
improvements and made steady progress the physical therapy.
He was cleared for discharge to rehab on postoperative day 7.
All surgical wounds were clean without signs of infection. His
creatinine continued to improve, and was 1.7 on the day of
discharge.INR on [**1-21**] was 2.0 after several doses of 5
milligrams.
