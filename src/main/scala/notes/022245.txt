Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2175-5-16**] where the patient underwent Aortic
valve replacement with 23-mm
Biocor Epic tissue heart valve.
 Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.   POD 1 found
the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD #4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
