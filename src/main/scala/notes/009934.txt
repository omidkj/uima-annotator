Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypovolemic Shock, Cardiac Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of right femoral trauma line

History of Present Illness:
This is [**Age over 90 **] year old lady with a past medical history significant
only for hypertension who presents status post cardiac arrest
with lower GI bleed, now intubated, on pressors status post
volume resuscitation.
.
The patient phoned her family this morning reporting that she
went to the bathroom and had a bowel movement and felt unwell.
The family arrived within 15 minutes and found her to have have
agonal respirations with a dark brown non bloody movement. CPR
was not initiated. EMS was called, and arrived 10-15 minutes
later and found the patient pulseless and apneic. The patient
received a 10-15 minutes of CPR and was asystolic on monitor.
2mg total of epinephrine were administered prior to ROSC. She
was intubated in the field with 7.0 tube and was given
vecuronium.
.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was in atrial fibrillation
with initial vital signs 64 113/62 18  Subsequently, heart rate
and blood pressure both began to drop. Patient then had multiple
episodes of melena/rectal bleeding, and was hypotensive to 60s.
She was immediately given emergency 0- blood x 2 units via a
right femoral cordis line (placed sterile) and was started on
levophed. She received an additional 2 units of crossmatched
blood and 2 units of FFP with slowing of bleed. Initial labs
studies signficant for ABG 6.96/57/7/14, lactate 10.5 and Hct
post rescussitation of 34, creatinine of 1.2 (baseline 0.9) and
potassium of 5.3 and lipase 62. She was given calcium gluconate
and sodium bicarbonate.  Repeat ABG 7.15/43/16/136. She was
unresponsive and did not require any sedation for the first 3
hours of her ED course. Physical exam significant for tenderness
to abdominal palpation for which she was given a 1x dose of
versed 2mg IV. A CT head demonstrated no acute intracranial
hemorrhage however presence of bilateral hypodense basal ganglia
concerning for acute hypoxia. A CTA abdomen and pelvis
demonstrated non specific findings however no clear etiology to
abdominal swelling or bleed. The post arrest team evaluated
patient and opted to not initate cooling protocol given
increased bleeding and hemodynamic instability. GI was
consulted. A NGL was negative and the patient was given 80mg IV
protonix and started on gtt. No plans for emergent scope.
.
The patient is full code.  The family at bedside, son is health
care porxy confirmed by family members. Social work met with
family.  The family is aware of patient's prognosis.
.
On transfer, the patients 72 145/64 99 on vent settings fio2 60%
PEEP 6 and Vt 450. She is on protonix gtt with fentanyl and
versed given aggitation.
.
REVEIW OF SYSTEMS (per patient family)
.
No recent complaints, patient intubated.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2183-3-22**]
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Prominent symmetric hypodensity of the basal ganglia
bilaterally. This
finding is nonspecific, though can be seen in the setting of
acute hypoxia (in this patient with recent cardiac arrest).
3. Paranasal sinus disease.
.
CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2183-3-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No apparent etiology to abdominal distention or GI bleeding.
2. Small amount of stranding and free fluid in the abdomen as
well as
intralobular septal thickening at the lung bases, likely related
to volume
resuscitation.
3. Atherosclerotic disease.
4. Small areas of hepatic enhancement. If clinically relevant,
would
recommend comparison to any prior imaging or evaluation via MRI.

5. Atherosclerotic disease.
6. Large left adnexal cyst, stable as best can be determined.
.
KUB  [**2183-3-22**] A single frontal view of the supine abdomen shows
no particular distention of the intestinal tract. A nasogastric
tube ends in a nondilated stomach.
.
CHEST XRAY [**2183-3-22**]
The endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm
above the carina. An orogastric tube is noted and appears to be
coiled and
kinked in the upper esophagus/hypopharynx. The distal end of the
orogastric tube does not go beyond the GE junction.
Allowing for technique, the heart is markedly enlarged. In
addition, there is bilateral interstitial opacity compatible
with edema. However underlying or developing infection or
aspiration cannot be excluded. A small right pleural effusion is
noted, but there is no large pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic
calcification.
