Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
MS change
.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI:  88 M w/  presented to OSH after having fallen while
carrying groceries from his car.  Wife thinks it was a
mechanical fall.  No head trauma.  No LOC.  He was noted to have
an acute MS change within 30 minutes.  T=101.8 upon arriving to
OSH ED.  Electively intubated for airway protection and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
ED COURSE:
-- U/A - 11-20 WBCs, occasional bacteria
-- WBCs - 28.9 w/ 91% lymphs
-- UCx and BCx sent
-- ceftriaxone and vancomycin started
-- CXR - Abnormal opacity involving both lungs. The finding
represents both airspace and interstitial disease. Diagnostic
considerations include pulmonary edema in the setting of chronic
interstitial changes. Bilateral pleural effusions are present as
well.
-- CT CHEST - Severe emphysema and moderate pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe consolidation could represent pneumonia,
aspiration or atelectasis. Mild stranding in left upper quadrant
around the splenic flexure of uncertain etiology.
-- CT HEAD - negative
-- EKG - sinus tachycardia, PVCs, nl axis, nl intervals, no
significant ST interval or T wave changes.
.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
-- PAF
-- htn
-- dyslipidemia
-- Transitional Cell bladder CA -- BCG tx
-- Lung mass (seen on staging CT [**7-/2106**]) -- left lower lobe
4x4x3cm, concerning for malignancy.  pt has to present refused
intervention.
-- TTE ([**7-18**]) - NL LV size and function, EF=60-65%.
-- glaucoma
-- osteoporosis
.

stimuli.  moving all extremities, but not to command.  toes are
neither upgoing or downgoing.
.


Pertinent Results:
MRI [**2107-1-24**]:IMPRESSION:
1.  Multiple punctate foci of increased diffusion signal are
suggestive of multiple watershed infarcts in the cortex between
the MCA/ACA distribution and MCA/PCA distribution.  This could
be secondary to an episode of global hypotension and/or hypoxia.

2.  No evidence of intracranial mass.
3.  Left choroid plexus xanthogranuloma.
4.  Fluid layering in the nasopharynx, possibly secondary to
patient
unresponsive state or intubation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  88 M w/ presented from OSH intubated after having fallen.
.
The patient was admitted from an OSH intubated to the MICU. He
was noted to have had a fall complicated by altered mental
status. Non-contrast head CT was negative for intracranial
bleed. There was high concern for an infectious process due to a
leukocytosis.  CT torso revealed no focal inectious etiology.
The patient was noted to have a positive UA and a question of a
pneumonia. The patient was initiated on ceftriaxone and vanco at
meningeal dosing. LP was not done due to elevated INR and
minimal clinical indications. MRI/A of the head on the day of
admission revealed numerous watershed infarcts. These were felt
to be consistent with either an episode of hypotension (which
the patient was not known to have had) or embolic phenomena. The
patient was known to have A. Fib but TTE did not reveal any
intra-cardiac thrombi. The patient was already fully
anticoagulated on admission and heparin gtt was initaited at the
time of infarct discovery. It is possible that the patient is
hypercoaguable secondary to malignancy. Repeat MRI/A on hospital
day 4 revealed progression of the patient's infarcted area. He
was successfully weaned from the ventilator. After discussion
with the family regarding the patient's poor prognosis, he was
advanced to comfort measures only and transferred to the
medicine floor service. On the medicine service he received
ativan, morphine and scopolamine as needed for comfort. The
patient expired at 09:55AM on [**2107-2-1**] when he was found to have
no pulse, no spontaneous breaths and no pupillary reflex. The
patient's family was contact[**Name (NI) **]. They declined an autopsy.
