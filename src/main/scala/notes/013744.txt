Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old female presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital for evaluation
of TAA/AAA after 3 days of LUQ pain radiating to back.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation. CTA at OSH showing distal
descending AAA and proximal abdominal AAA 3.5cmX3cm with
question of minimal leakage. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **].
SBP stable 140's during transfer. Evaluated by cardiac and
vascular surgery.
Patient admitted to Vascular Surgery. Blood pressure monitored
and medication given to maintain SBP <140. Repeat CT and
non-contrast CT stable, no leak.
Discharged home on [**5-16**] with VNA to monitor blood pressure. Will
f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with repeat CT in 2 weeks. There was no
clear leak or rupture and due to the location she was quoted a
combined morbidity rate of greater than 25% for mortality, renal
failure and or paralysis. She did not want surgery unless there
was no choice. Since her CT scans did not change and her pain
easily resoved with BP control, conservative management with
aggressive f/u was agreed upon. She understood that this plan
could result in a delayed rupture but wanted to proceed in this
manner. Her prinmary care Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of the plan by
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and will help cooordinate BP control and CT f/u.
