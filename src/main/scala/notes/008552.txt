History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:  Ms. [**Known lastname 94939**] is a 66 year old
right-handed woman who has a history of two prior strokes with
residual weakness (husband not sure which side) and trouble with
speech, multiple MI's, and thyroid disease, who was found lying
on the floor by her husband 30 minutes ago.  She was last seen
normal at 3:30 p.m. when her husband observed her sitting up in
bed watching TV.  Then at about 5 p.m. he heard a thump and
found
that she had fallen out of bed and was lying on her left side.
He thinks that she was trying to talk but says she wasn't
producing any sounds, and wasn't following any commands.  EMS
arrived and found her to be nonverbal with left sided weakness.
She was then brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  I was able to examine her
(as described below) immediately upon arrival, after which she
was intubated due to her somnolence.

Per her husband Ms. [**Known lastname 94939**] had strokes in [**9-24**] and [**1-25**], both
of
which were treated at the [**Hospital1 756**].  He is not sure where the
strokes were located, but thinks they were from clots and not
bleeding.  She has residual weakness on one side (first he said
left, then right) and has trouble speaking, but can walk with a
cane at baseline.  He notes that her function has been declining
lately but cannot say why.  She does not take any medications
per
her own choice.  She has no history of diabetes or hypertension.


Review of systems:  No known recent systemic illness per her
husband.

Physical Exam:
Examination:
T  afebrile    HR 93   BP 161/86   RR 18  Pulse Ox 100% on O2 NC
General appearance: Frail 66 year old woman lying in bed with
eyes closed, occasionally squirming with right arm and leg
HEENT:  c-spine collar in place due to fall
CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops. No
carotid bruits.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, no hsm or masses
palpated
Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema

Mental Status:  Eyes are closed, does not open them to voice or
noxious stimuli.  Does not follow commands.  Does not produce
any
sounds or attempt to speak.  She does squirm with her right arm
and leg with sternal rub.

Cranial Nerves: Right pupil round and reactive 3>2, left round
and reactive 2.5>2.  Right gaze preference, can get to midline
but not past (could not check with OCR due to C-spine collar).
Does not blink to threat on either side.  There is no nystagmus.
She has R>L facial weakness.  She would not open her mouth.

Motor System: Diffusely diminished muscle bulk.  Tone is normal
on the right, flaccid on the left.  She spontaneously moves the
right arm and leg, semi-purposefully, but has no movement of the
left arm and leg, even to noxious stimuli.

Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  Plantar
responses are extensor on the right, equivocal on the left.  No
[**Doctor Last Name 937**].

Sensory: She neglects the left side completely, with her head
turned to the right. Localizes to noxious stimuli with right
arm/leg, does not seem to notice noxious stimuli on the left
(although the latter assessment was made difficult by the fact
that she was getting needle sticks on both the right and left
side simultaneously during my examination)

Coordination/Gait:  Could not assess

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to ICU under Neurology Service because
intubated.
Neurology:Patient had MRI done on day of admission which showed
right MCA inferior division acute stroke. Concern for seizure
was less likely and Dialntin and EEG cancelled. Patient had a
full stroke work up which revealed triglycerides of >900,
cholesterol > 300 and TSH >100. She was started on gemfibrazole,
Synthroid, and Atorvastatin. She had a TTE which was negative
for LV dysfunction, thrombus, or vegestations. In terms of her
exam, she followed no commands, had no speech, was very agitated
despite propofol/fentanyl, did not blink to threat, had left
hemiparesis arm > leg. She was able to be weaned to CPAP but
extubation was not possible because of copius secretions and
lower lung collapse. She developed a ventilator associated
pneumonia and was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. She was fed
via NG tube. Her daughter and proxy made the decison to make the
patient CMO as it was likely patient would need PEG and
tracheostomy in long term management. Palliative Care was
consulted and patient made CMO. She died on [**2171-2-28**].
