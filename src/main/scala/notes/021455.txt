Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from the SICU for persistent leukocytosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73 y.o female who is s/p CABG [**12-15**] that was complicated
by a post-op PNA that lead to peg/trach and a rehab stay. At
rehab pt developed mediastinitis. She was recently admitted to
the SICU service for bleeding from the trach site.
.
INR on presentation was ~3. Pt s/p bronch that did not show
source of bleeding but did snow a "small area of raw
friability". Pt found to have L.sided pleural effusion that was
tapped and found to grow WBCs but no micro. Sputum cx grew
e.coli and actinobacter. Pt has been on ABX (tobramycin and
tigacyclin) and followed by the ID service. SICU team requested
transfer for management of leukocytosis. Description of events
in the SICU as follows. Today, pt spiked to 101, HTN and
tachypneic to 40's. At this time, there are no plans for any
other thoracics/IP procedures.

tube feeds held. Tolerated trach mask majority of the day,
returned to vent on minimal settings over night for increasing
tachypnea.

trach mask for 9-12 hours, throughout the day. currently back on
cpap/ps.

Brief Hospital Course:
73F s/p CABG on [**1-6**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib,
and respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with
bleeding from her tracheostomy site and later developed
loculated left pleural effusion and persistent leukocytosis on
tobramycin and Tigecycline upon arrival to the MICU

MICU COURSE
==================
[**3-29**] Events:
-spiked to 101.4, pancultured
-lasix gtt
.
[**3-30**] Events:
- Had dose of 0.5 mg of dilaudid IV and then began to have low
tidal volumes and desats so had to be switched to volume control
ventilation
- Diuresis ongoing with furosemide drip, titrated up to 10 mg/hr
with slowing urine output so chlorothiazide was given to help
augment diuresis
- Increased free water flushes from 50 Q4H to 100 Q6H due to
elevated AM sodium
- Patient with low tidal volumes overnight on pressure support
and high airway pressures on assist control ventilation, mucus
plug was suctioned and patient because stable on pressure
support 14 over 5
- Afib with RVR to 130s in the morning got metoprolol 5 mg IV x
3 with only transient breaks into sinus rhythm, then got
diltiazem 10 mg IV x 1 with EKG after showing sinus tachycardia
of 100.
.
[**3-31**] Events:
- Increased Metoprolol to 50mg q6h and added PO Dilatizem at
60mg q6h for afib with RVR.
- Got pan-culutured for temp of 101.1
.
[**4-1**] Events:
- Pan cultured for temp of 102, lasix gtt held
- ordered for CT torso and TTE [**1-8**] ID recs
- GPCs in pairs and clusters in BCx from [**3-31**] x 1 bottle

[**4-2**] Events:
- Echo: no veggies
- CT chest: improved multifocal consolidation.  Enlarging
bilateral pleural effusion, increased anasarca and increased
amount of ascites. Heterogeneous left pleural effusion and
denser
intraperitoneal fluid could be related to blood.
-put in for US guided diagnostic para for AM

[**4-3**] Events:
- Parcentesis:  no SBP though leukocytes present, 1L removed
- Started Lasix drip at 10, given chlorthiazide 250mg IV x 1
- Cardiology recs: c/s PE, diurese aggressively, likely not
dressler's/auto-immune.
- UCx growing klebsiella from [**4-1**], recent sputum Cx growing
acinetobacter and E. coli [**4-1**], [**3-31**] B Cx coag. neg. staph, ID
mentions to D/C vancomycin.
.
[**4-4**] Events:
- lasix gtt

[**4-5**] events:
-PICC line placed in brachocephalic vein
-diuril only given at 3pm for first time. Put out well to this.
At 9pm, still +400cc

[**4-6**]
-TEE demonstrates small vegetation, ID considering starting
patient on antifungal for fungal endocarditis given prior
history of fungemia (fluconazole though not first line, or
ambisome/flucytosine as first line for fungal endocarditis
though very toxic). Neither started because unclear if patient
truly has a fungal endocarditis.
-Bolused 500cc for hypotension
-negative 700cc at 10pm
.
[**4-7**] Events:
- Lasix gtt held
- given 1 u pRBC
- weaned off dopamine
- urine lytes, fe-urea= 54

[**4-8**] events:
-started ambisome for presumed endovascular fungal infection
-restarted metoprolol 12.5mg
-ophtho evaluated patient for evidence of fungal endopthalmitis.
No real evidence of fungal infection. But there is a superficial
lesion on Left retina. Very unlikely to be fungal. More likely
cotton wool spot or myelin. But can't rule out fungus. They'd
like to see her again in 2 weeks. Make a note in the chart to
reconsult optho on [**4-22**].
-CXR worse (see read)
-plan for family meeting Monday. There's some controversy over
who the HCP is.
-HCT down to 20.7. Labs suggest hemolysis vs. DIC. Trans
