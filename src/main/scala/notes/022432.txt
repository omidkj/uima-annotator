Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 yo F h/o ILD (normal O2 sat at baseline), RA,
atrial flutter, CHF, pacemaker, dementia admitted for hypoxia.
Per call-in to ED, the patient fell yesterday; X-ray pelvic and
lower back unremarkable. Then this morning at 4am, was found to
be 79% on RA, improved to mid-90's on NRB. Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, the
patient was not in distress or tachypnic. The patient herself is
unable to answer questions reliably.
.
In the ED: The patient arrived hypoxic to 84 on ra and 88 on 4 L
NC, 94 on NRB. The patient was not tachypnic or in distress. CXR
showed pulmonary edema; PE demonstrated crackles [**1-2**] way up lung
fields bilaterally. BNP elevated to 3284. Trop neg. EKG with old
Vpaced at 70, neg Sgarbossa's critera. She was placed on Bipap
[**9-3**], nitro gtt and lasix 20mg IV.  She put out 650ml. She was
then admitted to the MICU for further care.

.
CXR ([**2125-4-7**]): Diffuse bilateral airspace and interstitial
opacities with increased reticulation primarily in the upper
lungs. These findings may represent pulmonary edema superimposed
on chronic lung disease. Alternatively, a diffuse infectious
process may be present. Recommend follow up radiographs after
diuresis.
.
CT Chest ([**2125-4-9**]):
Extensive interstitial lung disease in both lungs. Ground-glass
opacities probably associated with pulmonary edema. Presence of
pacemaker with the leads in expected positions. Mild
cardiomegaly. No evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.
Airways are patent to the subsegmental level bilaterally.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are identified in the aorta.
Pulmonary artery measures 34 mm and suggests presence of
pulmonary
hypertension. At the level of main pulmonary artery, the
ascending aorta measures 44 x 43 mm. At the level of the left
inferior pulmonary vein, the descending aorta measures 42 x 36
mm. Right thyroid gland is enlarged, with a 10 mm hypodense
nodule. Enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinal and thoracic inlet
stations.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Presence of degenerative changes in spine.
No worrisome bone lesions.

Limited images of upper abdominal organs is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive interstitial lung disease.
2. Ground-glass opacities could represent areas of pulmonary
edema. Mild
cardiomegaly.
3. Enlarged lymph nodes.
4. Dilated thoracic aorta, with the ascending aorta measuring up
to 44 mm and the descending aorta measuring 42 mm.
5. Findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
6. Enlarged right thyroid gland with nodule. US is suggested for
further
evaluation.
.
TTE ([**2125-4-10**]):
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CTA Chest ([**2125-4-11**]):
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Extensive interstitial lung disease. The upper lobe
predominant pattern
is suggestive of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
3. No evidence of pulmonary edema at present study.
4. Stable enlargement of lymph nodes.
5. Stable dilated thoracic aorta with the ascending aorta
measuring up to 45 mm and the descending aorta measuring up to
40 mm.
6. Main pulmonary artery is top normal, today measuring 30 mm.
7. Again seen nodule in right thyroid gland. Ultrasound is
suggested for
further evaluation if not already done.
.
CXR ([**2125-4-15**]): No significant interval change in diffuse
parenchymal abnormalities and cardiomediastinal contour was
demonstrated. No interval development of pleural effusion or
pneumothorax has been seen. Again note is made that the degree
of the lung involvement by interstitial abnormalities is severe.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo F h/o ILD in the setting of RA, atrial flutter, CHF,
pacemaker, dementia admitted for hypoxia. The following issues
were investigated during this hospitalization:
.
# Hypoxia: Patient was intermittently hospitalized in the MICU
during her hospitalization for persistent hypoxia. While patient
does have significant ILD, presumed to be due to RA, it was not
felt with rheumatologic and pulmonary consults that she was
having acute decompensations of her lung disease, but that
rather, it was serving as a poor baseline for transient hypoxic
insults. Patient was maintained on prednisone 10 mg which was
not increased as it was felt to not be likely to help and
instead worsen her mental status. An echo documented diastolic
heart failure and the patient was diuresed to being a total of 6
liters negative for length of stay. She was discha
