History of Present Illness:
69 yo male with history of esophagectomy for Barrett's
esophagus, HLD, HTN, CAD, AFib, DM T2, COPD, DVTs/[**Hospital **]
transfered from [**Location (un) 12017**] for c5-c6 epidural abscess and MSSA
bacteremia.  The patient was transfered given his primary
surgeons, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], are here at [**Hospital1 18**].  He was initially
seen on [**2192-5-9**] at [**Hospital 8641**] hospital for leukocytosis, had evidence
of UTI.  Subsequently Blood and urine cultures grew MSSA and he
was treated as an outpatient with Bactrim.  He then had acute on
chronic neck pain on [**2192-5-13**] and presented to [**Location (un) 12017**] regional
hospital.  There, he was found to have herpes zoster in his
anus, started on acyclovir and treated with keflex for known
MSSA UTI/bacteremia.  Cervical MRI was obtained for neck pain
which showed cervical discitis and epidural phlegmon at C5-C6.
Then, he was transitioned to nafcillin.  His last blood cultures
were positive on [**2192-5-14**].  Reports increasing incontinence of
urine and stool.  Has been treated with large pain regimen of
gabapentin, morphine PCA.
.
The patient was transferred and appeared well and not in acute
distress. He was complaining of neck pain, as well as pain in
the right shoulder. No fevers. No urinary complaints.
.

MRI C-spine, L-spine, T-spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased signal intensity in the C5-C6 disc and C5 and C6
vertebral
bodies along with an epidural component of soft tissue
enhancement with
moderate canal stenosis and compression on the cervical cord as
seen on the prior study. Findings were discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2192-5-20**].

CT C-spine:
1. Diffuse demineralization, without fracture or traumatic
malalignment.
2. Disc space narrowing and anterior/posterior osteophytes,
resulting is
moderate-to-severe canal narrowing at this level. This, as well
as findings concerning for discitis/osteomyelitis, were better
assessed on the MRI performed earlier the same day. Please see
that report for further details.

TEE:
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not
well seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Mildly thickened aortic valve
leaflets without discrete vegetation. Likely aortic stenosis
(not quantified). Mitral valve not well seen due to anatomic
abnormality of prior esophagectomy/hiatal hernia.

EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Intraventricular
conduction delay of right bundle-branch block type. ST-T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2190-1-13**] limb lead
voltage is now less prominent at a faster rate.
