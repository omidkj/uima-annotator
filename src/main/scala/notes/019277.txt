HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**] is a 75 year old
woman from [**Hospital1 700**] admitted on [**2188-6-28**] for evaluation for the question of dialysis.  The
patient was last admitted to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2188-5-27**] for workup of new onset acute renal
failure, urosepsis, [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome and chronic
ventilatory dependence.  She was discharged to [**Hospital1 20731**] without dialysis as there was no indication
then for dialysis.

The patient's acute renal failure continued to worsen and she
had a question of altered mental status, leading to this
readmission, for workup of uremic encephalopathy and the
requirement of dialysis.  The patient was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit because of ventilator dependence
at night.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
1.  Acute renal failure:  The patient had hyperkalemia on
admission, which resolved with a Kayexalate enema and Lasix.
She was evaluated by the renal service and started bedside
hemodialysis through a femoral line on [**2188-6-30**].  No
improvement of mental status was noticed after two days of
dialysis.

A family meeting was held on [**2188-6-29**] with the
patient's sister, who is her health care proxy, regarding the
goals of our care for the patient.  We discussed at length
regarding the need for hemodialysis, the need for a permanent
catheter to be placed and regarding the overall prognosis of
Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**].  The patient's family decided to give her a
trial of hemodialysis from her femoral line and observe what
benefit it will bring, then they will decide regarding
chronic hemodialysis.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**] had minimal mental status
improvement after two days of hemodialysis.  The patient's
family decided on [**2188-7-1**] that they would not consent
to further procedures or hemodialysis and would want only
comfort measures for Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**].  Hemodialysis was stopped
on [**2188-7-1**].

2.  Ventilatory status:  The patient was placed on 12 hours
off ventilator wean on her first day, and was noted to have
some apneic episodes and appear labored in her breathing.  We
therefore placed her on 24 hour PSV then switched to AC in
order to better ventilate her and to rule out any hypoxia,
hypercarbia as a cause of her altered mental status.  The
patient's family had decided on comfort measures only on
[**2188-7-2**].  The patient was then taken off the
ventilator that afternoon and given oxygen over her
tracheostomy mask.  She was not to be put on ventilator
support from now on.  The patient is to receive morphine if
she appears distressed from breathing.

3.  Urinary tract infection:  On admission, a urinalysis was
sent and the patient was found to have plenty of bacteria and
yeast in her urine.  Later, the urine culture came back to
show Klebsiella pneumoniae, sensitive to Bactrim.  The
patient is now treated, day number five of Bactrim DS on
discharge.

4.  Diabetes/hyperglycemia:  The patient had been
hyperglycemic during this admission, likely secondary to her
urinary tract infection.  As the patient is now only comfort
measures, she is getting her daily NPH at the same dose as on
transfer, but no more daily fingersticks to check her blood
sugar level.

5.  Nutrition:  The patient is to receive no intravenous
fluids.  She received 35 cc/hour of Nepro tube feeds and 250
cc of free water bolus through her nasogastric tube every
day.  The family has not yet decided whether to stop tube
feeding her and to remove her nasogastric tube.

6.  Altered mental status:  A CT scan was performed for
further evaluation of possible causes of the patient's mental
status alteration and potential prognostication in terms of
neurological status.  A CT scan of the head showed no acute
infarction or hemorrhage, with small vessel disease in the
periventricular white matter and an old putamen infarction.

7.  Cardiovascular status:  An echocardiogram was performed
to evaluate the cardiovascular status of Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**].
Results showed a mildly dilated left atrium and right
atrium, otherwise no change from patient's echocardiogram on
[**2188-2-13**].
