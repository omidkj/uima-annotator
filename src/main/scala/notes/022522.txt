Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19859**]
Chief Complaint:
Weight loss, found to have small bowel lymphoma
Intra-abdominal abscess

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Small-bowel resection & anastomosis.
2. Sigmoid [**First Name3 (LF) 499**] resection  & anastomosis.
3. TAP Block
4. Exploratory laparotomy.
5. Duodenojejunostomy.
6. Doudenal exclusion
7. Placement of intra-abdominal drains.

History of Present Illness:
The patient presented to her oncologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2405**], on
her routine follow up with significant amount of weight loss.
She underwent staging scans which demonstrated a large mass
involving the fourth part of the duodenum, possibly the first
part of the jejunum with some necrotic areas and air within
them; in addition, a second small bowel mass involving the small
bowel.  Given the location of the retroperitoneal tumor as well
as the necrotic nature of the tumor, decision was made to
proceed with surgical resection if possible as endoscopic biopsy
would not provide adequate diagnosis.

Pertinent Results:
Pathology:
SPECIMEN #1: PART 1 (A-L) SMALL BOWEL MASS, EXCISION.

DIAGNOSIS:
EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY HIGH GRADE T-CELL LYMPHOMA, BEST
CLASSIFIED AS ENTEROPATHY-TYPE T-CELL LYMPHOMA TYPE I (ETCL-I),
WITH PLEOMORPHIC/ANAPLASTIC FEATURES. SEE NOTE UNDER SPECIMEN #2
BELOW.

Microscopic description: Sections show a lymphoma infiltrating
the small intestinal wall, from mucosa to serosa. The lymphoma
is composed of a pleomorphic population of medium to large-sized
cells with hyperchromatic nuclei with variable shapes (round,
doughnut-like, indented forms, etc), and moderate amount of
eosinophilic cytoplasm. Frequent apoptotic bodies and atypical
mitoses are seen. The tumor extends towards the serosa and is
also present in the deep lymphatics. Areas of confluent
??????geographic?????? necrosis are present. In some sections the tumor
extends into the mucosa, where ulceration and granulation tissue
is present.  The radial margin ??????stapled margin #1?????? is involved
by tumor, while the radial margin labeled ??????stapled margin #2?????? is
free of tumor.  A piece of fibro fatty tissue containing lymph
nodes, which is attached to one radial margin shows lymphoma
cells within the lymph nodes sinuses.  Within the ??????stapled
margin #1?????? the bowel mucosa is unremarkable, but the lymphatic
are studded with lymphoma cells. In sections labeled ??????tumor with
adjacent normal bowel?????? and shows small bowel mucosa and
submucosa with extensive involvement by tumor. The tumor is
present in the lymphatics. Lymphoma infiltrates the subcapsular
and medullary sinuses of lymph nodes present in the attached
mesentery.

SPECIMEN #2: PART 2  (M-T) SIGMOID [**Name2 (NI) **], EXCISION.

DIAGNOSIS:

EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY HIGH GRADE T-CELL LYMPHOMA, BEST
CLASSIFIED AS ENTEROPATHY-TYPE T-CELL LYMPHOMA TYPE I (ETCL-I),
WITH PLEOMORPHIC/ANAPLASTIC FEATURES.


Brief Hospital Course:
During her elective small bowel resection for lymphoma, the
patient was found to have a large retroperitoneal mass
approximately 15 cm in diameter lying over the aorta, IVC in the
retroperitoneum, deep to fourth part of the duodenum, and
pushing into the fourth part of duodenum anteriorly.  The
inferior most aspect of this mass was adherent to a mobile part
of sigmoid [**Name2 (NI) 499**] which had perforated into tumor and there were
some necrotic parts to the tumor present.  In addition, in the
mid small bowel, she had a large small bowel mass which was
occluding the small bowel lumen.  There were  multiple large
lymph nodes on the small bowel mesentry. There were no
additional lymphoid deposits in the peritoneal cavity on the
liver, gallbladder, remaining [**Name2 (NI) 499**].

On POD [**2-6**], she had increasing abdominal distension, pain, and
discomfort in the left upper abdomen.  On POD 5, a CT
demonstrated a collection of fluid and air concerning for an
abscess and the patient underwent laparotomy.  She was found to
have bilious fluid in left side of her abdomen and a small
amount on  right side of  abdomen.  There was bilious fluid
leaking through an opening of retroperitoneal lymphoma through
which the sigmoid [**Month/Day (3) 499**] had perforated.  In addition,
examination of small-bowel anastomosis, gastrojejunostomy, and
sigmoid anastomosis did not demonstrate any leak.  There was no
intra-abdominal abscess present, though there was a collection
of bilious fluid in upper left paracolic gutter along anterior
abdominal wall.  She was transfered to the SICU postoperatively.
 She had two drains in place: One in the excluded duodenal
segment and one intraperitoneally.  Please see separate op
reports for more specifics.

In the SICU she continued to have increasing pain and her NGT
continued putting out copious fluid.  She never had any recovery
of bowel function, not passing any flatus or having any BM's.
Her prognosis was discussed with her and her family thoroughly
and frequently.  On POD [**9-9**], palliative care was consulted for
goals of care planning and symptom management.  The patient
clearly stated that she did not want any more life prolonging
measures at that time.  On HD 15 her TF were stopped.  On HD 16
the patients IVF was stopped at the recommendation of paliative
care. The patient was started on a morphine drip at 1 mg/hr and
this was slowly titrated up to 10 mg/hr on HD 18.

On the morning of HD 18, at 10:15 am the patient passed away.
She had no active respirations, no heart sounds and no pupillary
reflexes.  The family was informed that she had passed.  The
family was offered, and declined autopsy.  The [**Location (un) 511**] Organ
Bank was called at the family's request and the bank declined
any tissue due to the patient's cancer.  The medical examiner
was contact[**Name (NI) **] who declined autopsy.
