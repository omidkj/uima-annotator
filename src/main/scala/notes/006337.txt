Brief Hospital Course:
51 year-old male with history of COPD, liver disease, and
alcohol abuse who was admitted to the MICU on [**4-21**] due to
hyponatremia and for IV antibiotics due to dogbites.  The
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course has been complicated by alcohol
withdrawal.

# Electrolyte Abnormalities (Hyponatremia): Based on history of
poor PO intake, patient's hyponatremia and hypochloremia were
most consistant with beer potomania, with compensatory metabolic
alkalemia.  No IVF was given and full diet was introduced.
Sodium and electrolytes corrected gradually over the next 36
hours at reasonable rate of ~0.5 mEq/h.  Phosphorous levels
decreased with re-introduction of food, felt likely to
refeeding; repleted IV and PO as required.  By time of discharge
his sodium and potassium with within normal limits.

# Dog bite: Multiple bite wounds on bilateral axilla, neck,
chest, and back suffered from brother's pitbull. Right axilla
wound down to muscle consequently sewn up by plastics.
Unfortunately dog not up to date on rabies.  Received Unasyn in
ED and was continued on IV while inpatient.  [**Location (un) 3844**]
animal control and public health officials notified.  Pitbull
was noted to have been aggressive in past, previously wounding
patient.  While neck bites are at high risk for transmission or
rabies, health officials recommended not initiating prophylaxis
rabies treatment.  Pitbull quarantined to crate at home for 10
days prior to family plan to euthanize animal.  Follow-up with
plastics arranged.  He was discharged on augmentin to complete a
10 day course.  Blood cultures were still pending at time of
discharge.

# Alcohol abuse/withdrawal: Patient denied other toxic
ingestions.  Placed on CIWA scale on admission and received
diazepam as necessary.  He required several doses of diazepam
due to symptoms of withdrawal.  Repleted thiamine/folic/MVI
orally to avoid administering extra fluid in setting of
hyponatremia.  He was counseled to avoid alcohol use in the
future.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Resolved with IV fluids.
Likely prerenal from hypovolemia.

# Hyperglycemia:  The patient had no history of diabetes, but
was found to have elevated BS and covered with SSI while
hospitalized.  He was not started on an oral medication due to
his risk of hypoglycemia when not eating and concern for
alcoholic ketoacidosis making metformin not an idea drug.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Most likely related to liver disease and
alcohol abuse, [**Name (NI) 653**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] for baseline labs, but not
recieved.  Thrombocytopenia stable, no sign of bleeding.
.
# Anemia: Most likely related to alcohol abuse and mixed
nutritional deficiencies.  Hct in mid 20's this admission with
unknown baseline.  Vitamin B12 WNL and folate low/nl.  No
clinical evidence of bleeding, but does have history of "liver
disease" possibly cirrhosis, so could be at risk for varices and
should have an EGD as an outpatient.  Also needs a screening
colonoscopy.  He was empirically started on omeprazole 40 mg
daily as he is at high risk of gastritis due to his recent
alcohol use.  He was given folic acid oral repletion and
multivitamin.  He was instructed to stop drinking, and do
everything possible in this regard.  He declined detox or rehab
referrals.
.
# Liver Disease: Related to alcohol use. INR 1.3. No evidence of
encephalopathy or chronic liver disease.
.
# COPD: Not on home inhalers. Plans to quit smoking.  No PFTs in
our system.  He was started on a nicotine patch. He will need
outpatient follow up/PFTs (if not recently done) and
consideration of starting a long-acting bronchodilator as he
appears to be symptomatic reporting dyspnea on exertion at
baseline.
