Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
SVT ablation
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
62 yo male with a history of tobacco abuse and regular alcohol
use as well as little interaction with the medical system who
presented to the ED with a 1 week history of worsening dyspnea.
Pt reports he began feeling short of breath the monday previous
to presentation worse with lying flat and exertion.  He states
previously he could climb several flights of stairs while
presently he can only walk 50 ft without becoming extremely
short of breath.  Additionally he has been unable to sleep for
the past week [**2-23**] to being unable to lie flat.  He denies
similar symptoms in the past but does note increased fatigue and
left sided chest heaviness for the past 2 years. He also notes a
history of dizziness with standing and one episode of LOC in
[**2128-1-23**] for which he was seen in the ED.   He denies that
his work as a construction worker has been affected by his
symptoms.
.
He was seen at the [**Hospital 778**] clinic and sent to the ED due to
tachycardia.  In the ED he was noted to be in a wide complex
regular tachycardia concerning for V-tach. On evaluation by
cardiology the rhythm was noted to be an SVT and he was
transferred to the cath lab for an ablation procedure. Carotid
massage resulted in termination of the rhythm on a p-wave.
However, pre-op holding, pt was found to be very tachypnic and
using abdominal/accessory muscles to breathe. CXR showed
pulmonary edema. He was given 30mg total IV lasix, 1mg Inderal,
and 2mg IV morphine. He was placed on a NRB mask and was then
moved up to the CCU. At time of transfer he had put out 400cc
pale urine. He was denying chest pain, palpitations, tachypnea.
He did have recurrence of his SVT x 3 during which he was
asymptomatic and which broke with carotid massage. Echo showed
LVEF of [**11-5**]%.

EKG: Wide complex tachycardia at 125 BPM, left axis deviation
TTE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**11-5**] %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. RV with depressed free
wall contractility. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.

Pertinent studies:
TTE ([**2129-9-6**])-  Biventricular hypokinesis suggestive of a
diffuse process (apical function suggests a non-ischemic
etiology). Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Increased PCWP.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-9-5**],
left ventricular cavity size is slightly smaller and global left
ventricular systolic function is improved. The heart rate is
much slower.

Cardiac cath ([**2129-9-7**])-
1. Coronary arteries had no angiographically-apparent
flow-limiting lesions.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
62 yo male with significant alcohol and tobacco use who presents
with dyspnea  secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting
of CHF and SVT.

Active Issues:
# Flash pulmonary edema- Patient was acutely dyspneic with
pulmonary edema on CXR and without peripheral edema at the time
of admission.  pro BNP was also elevated.  He diuresed well with
IV Lasix boluses, and was immediately weaned from non rebreather
to nasal cannula and maintained good saturations.  With
continued diuresis, patient's respiratory status improved and he
tolerated lying flat without issue. At the time of discharge he
was maintaining good oxygen saturations on room air.
.
# SVT: Given termination of arrythmia on a p wave with carotid
massage, felt to be consistent with either a bypass tract, AVNRT
and less likely an atrial tachycardia.  SVT responded to carotid
massage on multiple occasions, but returned shortly after.
Patient was started on metoprolol 25 mg po BID for rate control
which was increased to QID. TSH was low with mildly elevated T4,
consistent with hyperthyroidism.  Patient was started on
methimazole.  On HD3, patient was taken for an ablation of his
atrial tachycardia. A left sided bypass tract was identified and
ablated. He tolerated the procedure well with no ongoing
tachycardia. Metoprolol was changed carvedilol prior to
discharge.
.
# Acute CHF: Unclear etiology of CHF but likely acute
exacerbation of chronic disease. There was initially concern for
ischemic causes given LBBB on EKG, however cardiac
catheterization on HD2 and had no flow-limiting lesions.  It was
felt that his cardiomyopathy was likely multi-factorial in
nature and a result of his alcohol use, thyroid disease in
addition t
