History of Present Illness:
This is a 57-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma metastatic
to the thoracic
spine. He also had several pulmonary nodules which are of
unclear significance. He previously had undergone left
nephrectomy and placement of metallic hardware in the back for
stabilization. The patient was maintained on a tyrosine kinase
inhibitor with potent antiangiogenic properties. I had first
encountered the patient in [**2141-10-26**] when he presented with
perforated diverticulitis. At that time, after a failed attempt
at conservative management, I had performed
a sigmoid colectomy with end-sigmoid colostomy. The patient
failed to heal either the stoma tunnel or his midline wound
completely. Presumably, this was due to his study drug which was
reinstituted after the surgery. Over a few months, I had
observed the gradual development of a small ventral hernia.
However, on the day of surgery, the patient presented to the
medical oncology clinic with acute enlargement of the hernia. I
evaluated him and felt that he was at risk for evisceration and
transferred him emergently to the [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital Ward Name 517**]. After
arriving there, he ruptured the peritoneal investment overlying
the hernia and small bowel was observed to be present outside of
the abdomen. Therefore, he was taken to the operating room for
closure and exploration.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 yo male POD #2 s/p ex-lap and repair of bowel evisceration
transferred to ICU with respiratory distress.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for cardiopulmonary process, compare to prior CXR
[**5-8**]
INDICATION: Postop day two for repair of bowel evisceration,
respiratory distress.

COMPARISON: [**2142-5-8**].

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post posterior
thoracic spinal fusion with vertebral body cage device again
noted. Marked cardiomegaly is unchanged. The aorta is tortuous.
Pulmonary edema has nearly completely resolved. No focal
consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax is present.
Resection of several left-sided ribs is again demonstrated. New
right internal jugular central venous catheter tip is positioned
within the distal SVC.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged marked cardiomegaly with near complete
resolution of pulmonary edema.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval for PNA
HISTORY: Status post bowel repair with fever.

COMPARISON: [**2142-5-9**].

CHEST: AP semi-upright view. The right internal jugular central
venous catheter tip is in the superior vena cava. There is no
pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
There is no pulmonary edema. The lungs are clear. Spinal fusion
hardware and evidence of left upper rib resection is again
noted.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.

SCROTAL U.S.

Reason: Hydrocele? Prostatitis?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with tender scrotal edema and +UTI
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Hydrocele? Prostatitis?

INDICATION: 57 year male with scrotal tenderness.

There are no prior studies for comparison.

SCROTAL ULTRASOUND: The right testicle measures 2.9 x 3.4 x 3.7
cm. The left testicle measures 3.4 x 2.9 x 3.7 cm. The
echogenicity of the testicles is normal. Increased vascularity
is seen in a heterogeneous right epididymis. There is a
moderate-sized complex right hydrocele and pyocele cannot be
excluded. There is a small-to-moderate sized left hydrocele.
There is a small left epididymal head cyst.

IMPRESSION: Right-sided epididymitis with complex hydrocele. A
pyocele cannot be excluded.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
History of renal cancer, now post-op with shortness of breath,
chest pain, and desaturation; is there a PE?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: History of renal cancer now postop shortness of

COMPARISON: [**2142-3-15**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT non-contrast and contrast-enhanced axial CT
imaging of the chest with multiplanar reformats was performed.
In addition, contrast- enhanced CT axial imaging of the abdomen
and pelvis with multiplanar reformats was also performed.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Evaluation for pulmonary embolus is
limited secondary to respiratory motion. However, the main and
proximal pulmonary arteries enhance without filling defects. The
heart and other great vessels of the mediastinum are
unremarkable. Within the mediastinum are multiple new
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, not present in [**2142-2-24**].
The largest is a precarinal node measuring 22 x15 mm. A 12-mm
subcarinal and multiple greater than 12-mm subcarinal nodes are
present as well as a 14-mm precarinal node. These are all new or
increased in size since priro scan. No pathologic axillary
adenopathy is identified. Bilateral enlarged hilar adenopathy is
also present and markedly increased from the interval. The
largest node is a left hilar node measuring 22 x 12 mm. There
has also been interval enlargement of a large spinal mass
encompassing multiple thoracic vertebrae. A vertebral fixation
hardware and a spinal canal stent is in place. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are unchanged. Lung windows demonstrate
several pulmonary nodules, increased in size, including a 7- mm
right lower lobe nodule, previously 3 mm. Note that the target
lesions do not reflect the progression of tumor as the left
upper lobe nodule (target 1) today measures 14 x 8 mm,
unchanged. Target lesion 2, a upper lobe nodule measures 12 x 12
mm, unchanged. Increased interstitial markings and engorged
pulmonary vessels.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver enhances homogeneously. A
hypodense 15- mm cyst in the left lobe is unchanged. No
suspicious lesions are identified. A 15-mm soft tissue nodule in
the gallbladder is not apparent on the previous study. This is
of unclear etiology, possibly a metastasis. The pancreas,
spleen, stomach, and small bowel loops are within normal limits.
Target lesion #3, a left adrenal nodule, measures 34 x 30 mm,
increased since prior study here it measured 27 x 24 mm.
Multiple small retroperitoneal lymph nodes have also enlarged in
the interval. The patient is status post left nephrectomy. The
right kidney is normal. No free air or free f
