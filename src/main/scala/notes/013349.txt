Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
CAD here for pre-hydration before cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral baloon valvuloplasty


History of Present Illness:
81 yr old male with class 4 CHF, CAD s/p CABG, severe aortic
stenosis, severe PVD, HTN, high cholesterol who is admitted
today for pre-hydration before cardiac cath and aortic
valvuloplasty.  Pt states that he has been experiencing
worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past 3-4 years.
Currently, he can only walk about 20 feet or a couple minutes
before becoming short of breath.  He has lost approximately
75lbs over the past 4-5 years due to fatigue and dyspnea while
eating. Also over the past few years, he has been complaining of
burning leg pain on walking.  He sleep on 2-pillows because of
his hiatal hernia; he denies PND and lower ext swelling.  He
denies fevers, chills, abd pain, n/v/d; he states that he gets
up multiple times during the night to urinate.  He has a hx of
an MI several years ago and his angina was described as neck
pain.  He denies frequent chest pain but does feel a discomfort
in his chest when he exerts himself too much.

.

EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Right bundle-branch
block. Left ventricular hypertrophy. There are ST segment
depressions in II, III, aVF and leads V4-V6 as well as T wave
inversions which may be secondary to left ventricular
hypertrophy and/or the repolarization abnormalities with right
bundle-branch block. However, ischemia cannot be excluded.
Clinical correlation  is suggested.
.
CXR:Diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis with peripheral and
somewhat basilar predominance.  This is most likely due to a
cause of UIP, which may be idiopathic, related to drug toxicity,
collagen vascular disease, or
asbestos-related lung disease. Small left apical and lateral
pneumothorax.  In the absence of recent intervention, this may
be spontaneous as a complication of chronic interstitial lung
disease.
Patchy peripheral apparent consolidative changes in the right
lung, which may reflect confluent areas of fibrosis or an acute
infectious process.
.
CATH:
1. Coronary arteries not evaluated.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
3. Normal filling pressures.
4. Aortic valvuloplasty.
5. Bilateral perclose.
*
ECHO: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve with at least
moderate
aortic valve stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation. Regional
left ventricular  systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 81 yr old male with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, high
cholesterolemia, class IV heart failure, PVD and severe aortic
stenosis who was admitted for pre-hydration prior to cath and
aortic valvuloplasty.
.
1. CAD: s/p CABG in [**2176**] and PTCA in [**2182**]; diseased vessels
unknown, but remained stable and assymptomatic and followed by
outpatient cardiologist. He was continued on ASA, imdur, coreg,
but not on a statin because of history of liver toxicity
secondary to lipitor.  His coronary arteries were not evaluated
during the procedure.
.
2. CHF: class 4 by report; likely secondary to aortic stenosis,
symptoms of dyspnea with exertion improved after valvuloplasty.
Not on an ace-inhibitor because of renal failure.  Otherwise
continued on home regimin of carvedilol and lasix.  Continue to
follow daily weights at home.
.
3. Rhythm: remained in normal sinus rhythm and continued on a
betablocker.
.
4. Aortic Stenosis: severe, sympomtatic aortic stenosis with
valve area 0.7cm2, he had dual bilateral baloon valvuloplasty to
open his aortic stenosis with resultant 1+ aortic regurgitation
following procedure and good symptomatic improvement.
.
5. PVD: known symptomatic peripheral venous insufficiency in
bilateral lower extremeties with MRA done in [**11-29**] which showed
moderate to severe PVD in both lower extremities.  He will
return in future for LE stenting with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
6. Renal: per patient has had known renal insuffciency and is
followed by nephrologist in [**Location (un) 3844**] who is following his
renal function and administering procrit.  He was pre-hydrated
and given mucomyst pre-cath for renal protection.
.
7. Anemia: stable here- was transfused one unit PRBC during this
stay.  His iron studies, folate and B12 were normal.  At time of
discharge his hematocrit was 32. he will follow up with his
nephrologist for continued procrit injections.  He remained
guiaic negative and last had a colonoscopy in [**2190**] per
discussion with his PCP with diverticuli and one polyp.
.
8. Chronic interstitial lung disease: discussed with PCP and has
had known intersitial disease without a known source.  He
remained stable and this is consistent with his lung disease
prior to admission and remains on home oxygen as prior to
admission. His metabolic alkalosis on chemistries is consistent
with long stabding pulmonary disease.
