Service:  VASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right foot wound.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 66 year-old white male
smoker with a 60 pack year history with a past medical
history significant for diabetes noninsulin dependent times
thirty years, hypertension treated times forty years,
coronary artery disease questionable myocardial infarction
times seven according to the patient (last myocardial
infarction in [**2180**]).  The patient has had no surgical
intervention for his coronary artery disease.  He is
transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for surgical evaluation.
He was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**7-1**] after enduring a
right foot infection times five months.  Initial injury
occurred while removing a callus from the lateral surface of
his right foot.  The pain has persisted over the last three
months becoming impossible with onset of drainage.  The
patient was seen in the Emergency Department for care where
he was prescribed antibiotics Levaquin, Tequin and
Erythromycin.  He was given a follow up with vascular
surgeon, but the patient did not follow up.  On the last
admission the patient was diagnosed with osteomyelitis via
bone scan.  He received intravenous Clindamycin.  The patient
is now here for peripheral vascular evaluation.  The patient
is able to walk a full block six months prior to admission.
He denies any claudication, shortness of breath, chest pain,
but admits to claudication starting two months prior to
admission on the right side before on the left, currently
only able to walk [**12-11**] of a block and then claudication
ensues.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a sixty pack year smoker.  He has
smoked since [**2133**] until present time.  Alcohol intake is
three bottles of beer per day.  Last drink was in [**Month (only) **] of
this year.  He is a retired shipyard pipe fitter.  He has
also worked with mercury compounds.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 99.5, 78, 157/65, 18, 97%
on 2 liters.  Weight is 63 kilograms.  General appearance,
alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress.  HEENT
examination is remarkable for left carotid bruit.  Heart is a
regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Bowel sounds present.  He has a
nondistended, nontender abdomen.  There is no ankle edema.
Pulse examination shows palpable femorals bilaterally.
Popliteals are dopplerable bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis pulse
and posterior tibial pulse are dopplerable signal
bilaterally.  The right fifth metatarsal wound is 2.5 by 2.5
cm full thickness ulceration, very tender with gangrenous
changes.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 11.4,
hematocrit 33.3, platelets 254K.  BUN 28, creatinine 1.8, K
4.6.  Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm, normal axis,
no acute changes.  Chest x-ray showed appearance of lung
abnormal with diffuse increase in interstitial markings with
indistinctness of vessel and hilar outline findings, may
reflect congestive heart failure with primary diffuse
interstitial edema.  There is apparent elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm, which may reflect true elevation or
subpulmonic pleural effusion, blunting of the costophrenic
angle consistent with a component of right pleural effusion.
There is no significant left pleural effusion.  Admitting
urinalysis was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service.  He was placed on bed rest.  Vancomycin, Levo and
Flagyl were continued.  Cultures were obtained.  Initial
wound cultures on the right foot ulcer grew Oxacillin
resistant staph coag positive of two colony morphologies.
Sensitivities showed organisms sensitive to Vancomycin,
Rifampin and Gentamycin, resistant to Clindamycin,
Erythromycin, Oxacillin, Penicillin and Tetracycline.  There
were no anaerobic growth from the cultures.  During the first
48 hours the patient had multiple episodes of nausea and
vomiting.  Electrocardiograms were without significant change
and CKs were flat and troponins were flat.  GI was consulted
regarding the patient's nausea and vomiting.  Recommendations
after review of the chart and evaluation of the patient felt
that the patient's symptoms might be related to anxiety,
questionable gastritis and gastroenteritis or cardiac issues.
 The patient has been constipated for several weeks with low
frequency of bowel movements, which could also cause nausea
and vomiting.  Recommendations were to do liver function
tests, lipase and amylase to rule out any liver or pancreatic
problems.  The patient was ruled out for cardiac source for
his nausea by his enzymes and electrocardiogram.  Continued
diet as tolerated.  Consider starting Reglan on a prn basis
if patient's symptoms return, guaiac all stools and a bowel
regimen to prevent his constipation.  They felt an endoscopy
at this time was not indicated, but could be done if the
symptoms persisted.

Because of a left carotid bruit, which was auscultated on the
initial physical examination the patient underwent carotid
ultrasounds, which showed a very significant stenosis of the
left internal carotid artery with a narrowing of 80 to 99%
with increased velocities.  The left vertebral artery was
completely occluded.  The right internal carotid artery
showed diminished flow with right vertebral and antegrade
flow and no diastolic flow suggesting distal occlusion.
Echocardiogram was done, which showed an EF of 25 to 30% with
bilateral atrial enlargement, aortic valve was mildly
thickened with mild mitral regurgitation and symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy without reciprocal systolic
dysfunction.  KUB demonstrated obstipation and the patient
was given appropriate medications to improve.  Cardiology did
see the patient in preparation for consideration for his
carotid endarterectomy and revascularization.  Stress test
was obtained, which showed no anginal with an uninterpretable
electrocardiogram at baseline.  The nuclear portion of the
study demonstrated a moderate defect involving the inferior
wall.  There were no other defects identified.  The resting
perfusion showed the same defect involving the inferior wall.
The ejection fraction was calculated at 31%.  There was
global hypokinesia and the inferior wall could not be
assessed, because of lack of counts.

The patient received a unit of packed red blood cells prior
to his surgery for a hematocrit of 26.5.  He underwent a left
carotid endarterectomy on [**2194-7-11**].  His post transfusion
hematocrit was 34.2.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred extubated, but required reintubation
secondary to difficulty with breathing and labile blood
pressure.  His blood gas was on SLIMV 60% pressure support
and 5 of PEEP was 7.3, 54, 93, 28 and 0.  Neurologically he
remained intact.  The tongue did deviate slightly to the
right.  Nitroglycerin was instituted to maintain systolic
blood pressure less then 130.  Postoperative day one there
were no overnight events.  His antibiotics were Vancomycin
and Levofloxacin.  He continued to do well.  His morphine was
discontinued.  He was placed on Tylenol for incisional wound
pain.  His diet was advanced as tolerated.  His fluids were
heplocked and he remained in the VICU for continued
monitoring.  [**Last Name (un) **] followed the patient for his diabetic
needs.  Postoperative day two from his endarterectomy, he had
a low grade temperature of 100.2.  He required tr
