HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Of note, the presentation of
this patient is written in a very detailed admission note
already posted to the CCC computer record.  Please see that
admission note for full details.

In summary, the patient is a 50-year-old male with
interstitial lung disease secondary to a toxic reaction of
interferon treatment given to him for hepatitis in [**2191**] and
[**2192**].  He had a progressively worsening decline of
respiratory status which became acute approximately 2 months
prior to admission in [**11-2**].  On [**2198-1-19**], he presented to
the emergency room in acute respiratory distress and with
significant hypoxia.  He was managed overnight in the
emergency department with nebulizers, high-dose steroids,
antibiotics including PCP coverage and was taken on the
following day to the OR, by CT Surgery, for open-lung biopsy
to take samples of the right lower lobe and right middle
lobe.  The plan was to evaluate these samples from the
pathology and microbiology view point to determine the exact
nature of the patient's disease and prognosis.

Patient was transferred to the MICU status post the procedure
with a right chest tube in place, and he was intubated.
While in the MICU, the patient was never able to be
adequately weaned off the ventilator due to the severity of
his baseline lung disease.  This was an anticipated risk when
the patient underwent the initial procedure.  He also had
episodes of hypotension.  His hypotension was treated with
Neo-Synephrine drips.

During this time, the patient's family was extremely anxious
as expected as well as very uncomfortable with the fact that
the patient remained intubated as they were in complete
agreement that this was contrary to his wishes.  Multiple
family meetings were held with the patient's family which
included his wife, daughter, and son and it was agreed to
wait until the formal pathology results of the lung tissue
were available prior to making a decision.  The formal
pathology results of the tissue were reviewed and results
were discussed again at family meetings.  It was noted that
the patient had an extremely dismal prognosis.  Even if he
was able to wean off the ventilator following this procedure,
it was felt that his life expectancy would be very poor.

Given the fact of his dismal outcome as well as the current
difficulty weaning the patient off the ventilator and the
patient's previous wishes to never be intubated per family,
it was decided to offer supportive and comfort care only.
The patient was extubated and expired shortly thereafter.
Social support was offered by the entire MICU team including
nursing staff and a social worker to the family who was
present at the time and funeral arrangements were made
between the morgue and the hospital staff.
