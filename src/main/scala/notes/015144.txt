History of Present Illness:
71 yo man with Enterococcus MV endocarditis with blown posterior
mitral leaflet s/p six weeks of ampicillin, Coag neg Staph
bactermia on IV vanc, stage III NSCLC, hepatitis C, COPD, and hx
of right axillary vein/IJ thrombosis, presenting from [**Hospital1 **]
for worsening renal function, hyperkalemia ([**Hospital1 **] labs Cr 2.4
K, 6.1), hypotension, and hypoxia.
.
Patient recently discharged from OMED on [**2191-10-20**] with diagnosis
of coag negative staph bacteremia/?endocarditis for which he was
being treated with 6 weeks of IV vanc.  Creatinine upon
discharge was 2.2 up from 1.8 - etiology of increase not well
understood but postulated secondary to previous nephrotoxin.
.
Baseline home O2 requirement is 4L NC. Since d/c, patient
reports decreased urine production but denies dysuria,
hematuria.  Increased DOE and productive cough of yellow sputum
though denies SOB at rest, pleuritic chest pain, or worsening LE
edema. PND, orthopnea. No F/C. No abd pain/N/V/D/blood in stool
changes in bowel habits.
.
Yesterday, [**Hospital1 **] labs notable for worsening renal function and
vitals signs with new hypotension with SBPs in to 80s so
decision was made to transfer to the ED for further eval and
potential initiation of CVVH/HD.
.
In the ED, initial VS: Exam notable for expiratory wheeze, 3+ LE
edema. ECG without hyperacute t waves; SR at 94. NANI, TWi
V1-V3, no changes from prior.  CXR with bilateral pleural
effusions, stable extensive opacification of right lung with rll
collapse, hazy opacity in LLL, ? infiltration, PICC line coiled
on itself in SVC.  UA with 44WBC.  Foley placed with only 5cc of
fluid drained.  Patient received levofloxacin for possible PNA,
CTX for UTI and admitted to medicine for further eval of [**Last Name (un) **].
Patient given 3 combi nebs with improvement in respiratory
status.  VS prior to transfer 98.5 82 96/61 20 95% 4L

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**4-/2189**]: presented to an outside hospital with severe back
pain, with CXR showing right upper lobe lung mass. PET scan
revealed FDG avidity at the periphery of the mass, with an
FDG-avid paratracheal lymph node
- [**2189-7-31**] cervical mediastinoscopy, multiple lymph nodes neg for
malignancy (report not available).
- [**2189-8-5**] transthoracic biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**], nondiagnostic. Pt
declined RUL lobectomy
- [**2189-11-3**] new moderate right-sided pleural effusion; right lung
nodule increased from 6.6 to 7.7 cm and was again noted to have
broad contact with the chest wall
- [**2189-12-2**]: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] again saw the patient and recommended a
right thoracotomy and RUL lobectomy. Surgery was scheduled but
was canceled by the patient
- [**2190-1-1**] chest CT revealed further increase in the known
necrotic RUL lung mass, now measuring 8.1 x 7.5 cm. It was in
direct contact with the peripheral pleural surface, with loss of
a normal intercostal fat plane between the adjacent ribs,
suggesting possible chest wall invasion. The epicenter of the
mass was in the right upper lobe but crossed the fissure to
extend into the adjacent right middle lobe. Prevascular and
right paratracheal and precarinal lymph nodes were again
demonstrated, with a slight interval increase in the size of the
enlarged precarinal node. In the multidisciplinary thoracic
oncology conference, it was felt that the patient would most
likely
require a right pneumonectomy given the extent of his tumor.
However, due to his poor pulmonary function, with a DLCO of 60%,
it was felt that he would not tolerate a pneumonectomy.
- [**2190-2-4**]: A repeat bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound
was performed for diagnostic purposes, with a biopsy of the
right upper lobe mass revealing poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma with immunostains positive for P63 and CK7
(weak), negative for TTF-1. Squamous cell carcinoma was favored.
A transbronchial needle aspiration of station 7, 4R, and R11
lymph nodes revealed no malignant cells. Two sets of washings
were negative, but brushings were positive for malignant cells.

- [**2190-2-18**]: A repeat PET scan demonstrated no evidence of bony
metastatic disease. The previously biopsy-negative right
paratracheal lymph node was noted to be FDG-avid (SUV 4.7).
Thus, the patient was felt to have likely Stage IIIA (T3N1M0)
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
- [**2190-3-4**]: The patient began weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) and
paclitaxel (50mg/m2) given concurrently with radiation therapy.
Finished chemoradiation in [**3-/2190**], last dose of chemo on
[**2190-4-8**].
Required prednisone taper due to severe radiation pneumonitis.
.
[**2190-12-7**] CT torso showing a mildly enlarged cavitating lesion
in the right upper lobe, which is now 6.5 x 4.4 cm, increased
from 6.3 x 3.7 cm. There are two new right hilar lymph nodes,
both measuring approximately 2 cm
.
[**Month (only) **]-[**2191-1-25**]: Treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, with doses
intermittently held for LFT abnormalities.
[**2191-2-25**]: CT chest without contrast showing slightly enlarged
right upper lung mass, measuring 7.5 x 5.2 cm, with slightly
enlarged soft tissue component at the right middle lobe
bronchus, measuring 3 x 3 cm
[**2191-2-22**]: Palliative chemo with taxotere, with doses held due
to dehydration and cytopenias.
.
[**2191-4-3**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of uncontrolled nausea and
emesis, dehydration, volume depletion. Patient [**Hospital1 34676**] on [**2191-4-4**]

[**2191-4-12**]: discontinue taxotere due to intolerable nausea, emesis,
decreased appetite
.
[**2191-4-24**]: Chemo with vinorelbine
.
[**2191-7-14**] CT chest: decreased size in primary mass, measuring 6.5
x 4.1 cm, as compared to 7.4 x 5.2 cm previously. The previously
noted thickening of the medial wall has also decreased,
measuring 2.1 x 1.9 cm compared to 2.9 x 1.6 cm previously. No
new nodules are present. Severe traction bronchiectasis related
to post-radiation therapy changes has mildly improved. Severe
paraseptal emphysema is unchanged.
.
[**Date range (3) 34677**]: Hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for enterococcus mitral
valve endocarditis and T12-L1 diskitis/osteomyelitis. Treated
initially with ampicillin and gentamicin, with gentamicin
discontinued due to
impaired renal function. Six-week course of ampicillin is
scheduled to end on [**2191-9-16**]. He had a right internal jugular

and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided
port-a-cath, which was initially diagnosed at [**Hospital3 34678**] on [**2191-7-29**], and has continued on Lovenox for
treatment.
He was seen by cardiology for NSVT, mitral valve endocarditis,
and was started on metoprolol for rate control. He was seen by
cardiothoracic surgery for consideration of mitral valve repair,
with outpatient followup planned. He was discharged to the MACU
unit of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, where he has been since discharge.
.
[**2191-8-2**] CT angio of the chest showed a 4.5 cm x 3 cm thick-walled
mixed solid and cystic structure in the right upper lobe
corresponding to interval necrosis of treated tumor. There is no
pulmonary embolism. Severe paraseptal emphysema was seen, along
with post-radiation changes in the right lung. There is an
enlarged and irregular substernal thyroid goiter, with features
concerning for malignancy.
[**2191-8-5**] MRI of the L-spine showed resolution of previously noted
diskitis and osteomyelitis at T12 and L1. There were multilevel
degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine, stable,
causing moderate-to-severe canal stenosis.
[**2191-8-15**] MRI of the brain showed no intraparenchymal findings,
but
there was a new clivus mass, most likely representing an osseous

metastasis.
.
Other PMHx:
-Enterococcus mitral valve endocarditis
-Hepatitis C, acquired in prison, not treated, stable.
-Hx intravenous drug use, stable.
