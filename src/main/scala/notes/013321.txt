History of Present Illness:
60 year old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis complicated by
ascities, grade II varices, encophalopathy, SBP, currently being
listed for liver [**Year (4 digits) **], who was evaluated in clinic by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 497**] on [**2172-2-13**] and directedly admitted for evaluation of his
right lower extremity ulcer.  Patient notes that he has been
having chronic swelling for the past year.  He does not think it
is acutely worse, but does think it has been getting gradually
worse for the past 5-6 months.  He has been adherent to his salt
intake (aprox 1200mg per day) and fluid restriction (<2L per
day).  He has gradually noted that his foot has been weeping.
He is unsure how long he has had an open wound, but it has been
present for at least a week.  A visiting nurse noted it one day
prior to admit and called [**Date Range **] office for visit.  In
clinic visit on [**2-13**] his foot was noted to be cold and with an
open wound.  He was directly admited to the [**Month/Year (2) **] floor for
vascular evaluation.
.
Of note patient had a recent admit for shoulder pain.  He was
discharged at the end of [**2171-12-28**].

RUQ U/S ([**2172-2-15**]):
Targeted son[**Name (NI) 867**] in all four quadrants reveals a small to
moderate amount of ascites throughout the abdomen, with the
largest pocket
seen in the left lower quadrant. Small to moderate ascites.

CT Abdomen ([**2172-2-16**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive pneumoperitoneum out of proportion to expected from
that of a
paracentesis. Recommend clinical correlation, and surgical
consultation. If further imaging is deemed necessary, CT with
intravenous and oral contrast (Gastrografin) can be performed to
evaluate for visceral injury.
2. Known cirrhotic liver. Known sequelae of portal hypertension
with
splenomegaly, varices and moderate-to-large amount of simple
intra-abdominal ascites. No high attenuation to suggest
hemoperitoneum.
3. No evidence of hematoma adjacent to the paracentesis entry
site.

RUQ US ([**2172-2-23**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Lack of wall-to-wall color flow within the left portal vein,
which could indicate either slow flow or nonocclusive thrombus.
Correlation with CT or MR could be obtained for further
evaluation. Hepatofugal flow is identified within the left
portal vein.
2. Remaining hepatic vasculature is patent with normal
waveforms.
3. Cirrhosis with splenomegaly.
4. Small right pleural effusion.
5. Distended gallbladder with a stone within the gallbladder
neck and
gallbladder wall thickening. Findings may represent acute
cholecystitis in
the correct clinical setting, and further evaluation with HIDA
scan can be
obtained.

HIDA scan ([**2172-2-23**]): Serial images over the abdomen show
undetectable uptake of tracer into the hepatic parenchyma after
60 minutes. The study is therefore non-diagnostic.

Bilateral LE Duplex ([**2172-2-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Deep venous thrombus of the right posterior tibial vein. The
remainder of the right lower extremity venous system is patent.
2. No DVT in the left lower extremity.

RUQ US ([**2172-2-25**]): Continued distention of the gallbladder.
Acute cholecystitis cannot be excluded and plans are being made
for percutaneous cholecystostomy

CT A/P ([**2172-2-28**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study without IV contrast but no evidence of
hydroureteronephrosis or renal calculi.
2. Diffusely thickened jejunal wall, non-specific, likely third
spacing.
3. No small-bowel obstruction. Percutaneous cholecystostomy
drain in situ.
Interval decrease of small ascites. No drainable fluid
collection.
4. Cirrhotic liver and splenomegaly. Numerous porta hepatis,
celiac and
mesenteric nodes.
5. Moderate generalized anasarca.
6. Right basilar subtotal atelectasis. Patchy nodular opacity in
the right
lower lobe, non-specific, but cannot exclude infectious process.


RLE Duplex ([**2172-2-28**])
IMPRESSION:
Unchanged deep vein thrombosis seen in one of the two right
posterior tibial veins which has not propagated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Last update [**2172-3-6**]:

60 year old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis complicated by
ascities, grade II varices, encophalopathy, SBP, was being
listed for liver [**Month/Day/Year **], who was evaluated in clinic by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 497**] on [**2172-2-13**] and directedly admitted to medical service for
evaluation of his right lower extremity ulcer. Patient was
evaluated by Vascular surgery and found to have no vascular
compromise and was recommended to have his leg ace-wrapped,
elevated to reduce edema.

On [**2172-2-16**], patient underwent a bedside paracentesis by medical
team. 2.5L of clear fluid was withdrawn. Patient developed
abdominal pain a
