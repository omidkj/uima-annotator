Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**]
Chief Complaint:
acute liver injury, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation at [**Hospital3 **]
transesophageal echocardiogram
incision and drainage of right hand abscess


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 36 year old female with a history of HIV who was
found down in the lobby of her apartment buidling by neighbors
earlier this evening. By report she was brought into an
apartment where she was unresponsive and EMS was called, on
arrival EMS gave her 0.4mg of narcan with no effect. She was
then taken to [**Hospital3 **] where she was given another 0.4mg
of narcan, she then woke up and became very aggressive. She was
given a total of 20mg of IV ativan, then became lethargic and
was intubated for airway protection. Labs at the OSH were
notable for: AST of 3506, ALT of 1361, T-bili of 6.0, D-bili of
3.1, Cr of 2.69, lipase of 440, myoglobin>1000, INR of 2.85 and
troponin I of 2.98.  U/A was concerning for infection 25 leuks,
+nitrites, and moderate bacteria.  A CT of her head was limited
by motion but grossly negative,  She had a right IJ placed for
access, was given empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone, there was
concern for acute liver failure so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 37.6C, 95, 106/56, 100% on AC
16x500, PEEP of 5, FiO2 of 100.  Labs were notable for Na of
147, HCO3 of 36, Cr of 2.9, AST of 2467, ALT of 999, T-bili of
6.0, serum acetaminophen level of 7, CK of 4028, MB of 22,
troponin of 0.17, INR of 2.9, U/A showed moderate blood but only
2 RBC's. Urine tox screen was positive for methadone. Toxicology
was consulted in the ER and recommended starting a NAC infusion.
Hepatology was consulted who recommended continuing NAC, serial
tylenol levels, LFT's and renal function, broad spectrum abx,
PPI and blood work for transplant work up. ABG on AC 16x500,
100% FiO2 was 7.47/52/352. Imaging was significant for bibasilar
atelectasis, no evidence of any infectious process.  VS on
transfer: 112/63, 96, 100% on 500x17, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%, she has
not woken up in the ER, but did grimace with OGT replacement,
has been on propofol in th ER.
.
On arrival to the MICU initial VS were: 95, 113/70, 99% on AC
16x500, PEEP of 5 and FiO2 of 60%.  Off sedation she is moving
all extremities but not responding to any commands, appears
comfortable.

.
CT C-epine without contrast [**2188-3-7**]:
1. Orogastric tube is coiled within the oro- and hypopharynx and
does not
reach the stomach (based on the CT of the torso).
2. No acute fracture or subluxation.
3. Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of unknown clinical
significance.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a hypodense lesion in
the right side of the C6 vertebral body. This may represent a
hemangioma or focal fat deposition. However, comparison with
prior studies is recommended to exclude a more aggressive
etiology, such as a neoplasm. If prior studies are not
available, then an MR of the cervical spine may be helpful.
.
CT torso [**2188-3-7**]:
1. Appropriately placed endotracheal tube. Orogastric tube ends
in the
distal esophagus.
2. Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
3. Cardiomegaly and prominent pulmonary artery. Enlarged
pulmonary artery
may relate to pulmonary artery hypertension; correlate
clinically.
4. Mildly fatty liver. Steatohepatitis cannot be excluded based
on imaging.
5. No acute process of the abdomen orpelvis.
.
TTE [**2188-3-8**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic
dysfunction. Normal global and regional left ventricular
systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
