Pertinent Results:
CXR: clear
.
EKG: NSR @ 73; negative axis; incomplete LBBB, STD of 0.5 mm in
II, III, aVF with inverted TWaves and in V4-V6; there was
mentioning of T wave flatening on [**2107-8-3**] cardiology note -
although not present when compared to prior EKG of [**7-2**]
.
Echo [**12-2**]: EF 20-25; + 1 MR; mild pHTN.
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). Systolic function
of apical segments is relatively preserved. No left ventricular
thrombus is seen. Tissue Doppler suggests and incresaed LVEDP
(>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-7-1**],
left ventricular cavity size is smaller and the severity of
mitral regurgitation is reduced. The heart rate is also much
lower.
.
MIBI [**8-2**]:
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially reversible, large, severe perfusion defect
involving the LAD territory.
2. Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion defect involving the
PDA territory.
3. Increased left ventricular cavity size. Severe systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the mid anteroseptal,
distal anterior, distal septal, distal inferior and apical walls
as well as the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls.
.
HCT stable in mid 20's during hospitalization. On discharge CBC
was WBC 5.4, HCT 26.1, Hgb 8.7, Plt 308
.
Cr was 9 on admission with baseline of 0.8. This trended down to
1.1 on the day of discharge.
On discharge sodium 141, K 4.8, Cl 111, HCO3 26, BUN 10, Cr 1.1
Glucose 74

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old female with CAD, CHF EF 25%, subtotal colectomy who
presented with ARF
.
# ARF:
Likely prerenal, creatinine was up to 9 on admission and patient
required MICU admission for hypotension and hyperkalemia. She
was stabilized quickly with IV fluids. Creatinue trended down
gradually with IV fluids over the course of several days and was
1.1 at discharge. Renal US was unremarkable for structural renal
disease. Her ACEI was held given the renal failure and
hypotension. Her lasix was also held given the dehydration.
.
# Diarrhea:
The diarrhea is likely the cause of the patient's presenting
hypovolemia. She did have watery, profuse output from her stoma.
The cause is unclear though viral gastroenteritis is likely.
Stool studies for c diff and bacterial diarrhea were negative.
She did require IV fluid repletion to balance her stool output.
At discharge her stoma output was more formed.
.
# elevated troponin:
There was a mild troponin elevation to 0.06 with negative CK and
MB in setting of hypotension and ARF. There were lateral ECG
changes. She had a positive stress in [**8-2**] for which
intervention has been considered though not yet pursued. She was
continued on aspirin, BB, statin.
.
# Pancreatitis
This was likely secondary to acute illness. The pancreatic
enzymes trended down. She has no abdominal pain.
.
# systolic CHF with EF 25%:
She remained hypovolemic during the admission. Lasix was held
and she was given IV fluids. Beta-blocker was continued but the
dose was lowered given her hypotension. Her lisinopril was held
given the ARF and hypotension.
.
# Access - 2 PIV

# PPx - Heparin SC; H2Blocker

# FEN - cardiac diet

# Code - FULL

# Communication - Discussed with son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 73900**]; Also
spoke to PCP office, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31**] and faxed this report to
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 73901**].

TO DO FOR PCP:
[**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] check blood pressure, weight and creatinine, BUN and
potassium.
If patient blood pressure above systolic of 100, please increase
carvedilol to 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **].
If patient weight increases by more than 2 pounds or she is
clinically fluid overloaded, please restart lasix for fluid
overload. (weight was 45.3 kg (99.7 pounds).
If the patient blood pressure is above systolic of 120, please
restart lisinopril (but please check Cr and Potassium as well-
Cr was 1.1 on discharge with baseline at 0.8).
