Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Temporary pacing wire
Nuclear stress test
Endotracheal intubaction
Peripherally inserted central catheter
Central venous line
Intraosseous catheter

History of Present Illness:
82M DM, CAD s/p CABG, CVA, HL, HTN presented with a two day
history of weakness and nausea to [**Hospital3 6592**]. He was mottled
on presentation and noted to be in high grade AV block. He was
externally paced at 70. Presenting mental status was not clearly
documented.

Initial labs were significant for troponin T of 4.61 and pBNP of
[**Numeric Identifier 97824**] with pending CK-MB. Chemistry panel showed Na 140, K 5.5,
Cl 98, HCO3 21, Glucose 50, BUN 58, Cr 3.3 (unknown baseline).
LFTs were ALT 633, AST 1151.
VS at [**Hospital1 **] were variable including SBP readings x 3 of 57-78
with HR in 30s.
Patient was intubated with 7.5 ETT 24 cm at lip prior to arrival
to [**Hospital1 18**] - uncertain if was in frank respiratory failure or for
airway protection. Initial ventilator settings were RR 16, Vt
500, FiO2 100 %, PEEP 8. He was sedated with fentanyl and
midazolam. He was trancutaneously paced at 100 bpm.
On arrival to ER, initial VS were BP 89/46, MAP 50. Access was
lost. BP dropped to 60/37 and paced rate was increased to 100 to
help maintain blood pressure. Dopamine infusion had been started
at some juncture during transport and was increased. An IO was
placed for pressor infusion in the left tibia. Blood pressure
responded with resultant SBP 120-130s. A RIJ was placed with
transvenous pacing started (25 mAmp @ 110 with good capture).
Patient also had right femoral line. Dopamine was titrated down
to 13 before transfer to CCU. All lines were placed in sterile
fashion.

Admission Vitals:
110 (paced), 114/74, 92% vent (FiO2 50, PEEP 8, rate 20)
drips: fentanyl, versed, dopa 13 mcg/kg/min
On arrival to CCU, repeat ABG showed pH 7.30 pCO2 41 pO2 58 HCO3
21 and lactate 8 --> 5 --> 3.6. PEEP was increased from 8--> 12,
FiO2 50 % --> 70% with improvement of pO2 to 87. CXR showed
frank pulmonary edema with proper placement of support
structures. Dopamine was weaned further from 15 to 7. Pacing HR
was decreased from 110 to 90.
Patient had about 175 cc of urine output since arrival. Central
venous sat was 68.
Arterial line was placed for hemodynamic monitoring and frequent
ABG draws.
ROS unable to be obtained given intubated/sedation

TTE ([**2196-4-2**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to marked
pacing-induced mechanical dyssynchrony and probable contractile
dyfunction as well. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST ([**2196-4-6**])
Mild mucosal thickening and sinus opacification as described
above. This may be related to infection or inflammation or
intubated state.  No large air-fluid levels.

CT CHEST, ABD, & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST ([**2196-4-6**])
-Mild nonspecific inflammatory changes in the sigmoid mesentery.
Although a few colonic diverticula are noted in the sigmoid
colon, the inflammatory changes are not seen contiguous with
these diverticula. Diverticulitis however remains a
consideration a consideration.
-Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Centrilobular pulmonary emphysema in the upper lobes.
-Atherosclerotic vascular disease with infrarenal and common
iliac artery aneurysms.
-ETT ends 1.8 cm above the carina and needs to be retracted.

TTE ([**2196-4-8**])
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the inferolateral, basal inferior, mid- and
distal septal walls and hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall
and apex. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments
(LVEF = 25-30%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo M with CAD, CVA, HTN and DM presented with high grade AV
block, sepsis, and respiratory failure.
.
# Shock
The patient presented with hypotension requiring blood pressure
support.  Original hemodynamics were suggestive of a cardiogenic
etiology, however he began to have elements suggestive of
