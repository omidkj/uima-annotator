Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from MICU to floor after stay for unresponsiveness,
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right central line placement

History of Present Illness:
41 yo m w/ h/o HIV ([**1-15**] aCD4 234), HBV, admitted for failure to
thrive.  Partner at bedside significant particpant in history,
states that prior to development of ascites pt weighed approx
125.  Prior to paracentesis usually 150.  Now down to 130s.
Ascites better controlled on no salt diet.  Also having sig
diarrhea- [**1-17**] lactulose as titrated vs imminent
confusion/encephalopathy.  Denies f/c/n/v. Admitted for
post-pyloric placement.

Pt had a post pyloric tube placed on [**2-22**] and a theraptuic
paracentesis on [**2-23**] with 3.5 L out. He recevied lactulose
during this time.

Transferred to the MICU on [**2-24**] for unresponsivness to painful
stimuli, hyperkalemia, fever. ABG on admission was
7.51/17/105/14. Lytes were significant for K 7.5 with peaked TW
on EKG. Temp 101.4 rectally. Cultures were drawn, hyperkalemia
treated with D50/insulin/calcium/kayexalate. MICU team felt that
the patient was in sepsis with an alkalosis on top of chonic
metabolic acidosis. Central line placed for resuccitation,
placed on CTX/vanco. for presumed SBP or hosp. acquired infxn.
LP deferred given coagulopathy. Hyperkalemia resolved with
kayexalate. For his liver failure, pt started on vitamin K x 3
days. Renal failure (Cr 3.2) while in MICU. Pt thought to be
hypoperfusing with intravascular dryness. Renal team consulted
and considered hepatorenal syndrome vs. pre-renal renal failure
as etiology. Hyponatremia from diuretics. Anemia is noted to be
a chronic problem from HIV and ESRD, transfused 1 units PRBCS.
Other issues were stable. Pt was called out MS improved. Called
out to the floor for further managment.

Pt states he feels more alert, denies pain. He wants to eat.

Pertinent Results:
Labs

[**2-25**] CXR:
The right IJ line has been pulled back and the tip is now in the
superior vena cava. The film is again obscured by motion. No
focal infiltrate is seen. The feeding tube tip is off the film,
at least in the second portion of the duodenum.

[**2-24**] Head CT:
There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift
of normally midline structures. Differentiation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white
matter is preserved. Sulci, ventricles, and basal cisterns are
all within normal limits. The visualized paranasal sinuses, and
mastoid air cells are well aerated. The surrounding osseous and
soft tissue structures are within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 41 yo M with h/o HIv, hep B cirrhosis, who was
admitted for FTT s/p post pyloric feeding tube, tap [**2-23**], who
was transferrred to the ICU for unresponsiveness. Pt currently
awake, afebrile, HD stable, with improving renal failure who is
being transferred to the floor awaiting further management of
his liver disease.

Plan:

1. Fever: On admission patient was afebrile.  Unclear source as
both initial peritoneal fluid and fluid from diagnostic tap in
ICU were w/o evidence of SBP.  Patient defervesced on CTX and
vancomycin.   On transfer back to floor was vancomycin and
ceftriaxone were held as no known source had been established.
Culture data remained negative and patient had been afebrile
x48h prior to discharge.

2. Hypotension- hypotensive event likely [**1-17**] lg volume fluid
shift following therapeutic paracentesis.  Although only 3L
removed (less than that usually recommended for albumin
replacement), patient has underlying renal disease and thus
could not appropriately buffer redistribution.   Hyperkalemia
was likely [**1-17**] to add'l renal hypoperfusion and rapidly resolved
in ICU w/ administration of fluid.  Rapidity of resolution not
c/w hepatorenal syndrome.   Following fluid administration
patient did well w/o further episodes of hypotension.

3. Hep B cirrhosis: Awaiting transplant for liver and kidney.
Coagulopathy related to cirrhosis. Lactulose was continued for
mgmt of previously diagnosed encephalopathy, vit K x 3 days for
coagulopathy.  Patient remained w/ good mental status following
hypotensive event.

4. Acute on CRF: Improving renal function. Pt started on
midodrine, octreotide, albumin in ICU. Discontinued prior to d/c
as renal function had rapidly improved.

5. Anemia: Transfused 2 unit PRBCs.  No evidence of ongoing
bleeding.

6. HIV: On HAART, restarted following transfer out of ICU.
Continued on bactrim for ppx.

8. FEN: TF's,

9. PPx: pnuemboots, PPI

10. Code: Full while in house. HCP [**Name (NI) 12395**] [**Name (NI) 12396**].
