Date of Birth:  [**2068-8-7**]             Sex:   M

Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Found unresponsive.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
51 yo M with unknown past medical history found down by friends
yesterday AM.  History based on chart review is extremely
limited.  He was supposedly found unresponsive by his friends at
0800 yesterday AM and they went back to check on him last night
at 2200 and he was still unresponsive.  EMS was called and he
was noted to have pinpoint pupils, coffee ground emesis in his
mouth, and coarse respirations.  He was given narcan 4 mg IM in
field and taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  Upon arrival T 99.5 P
113 RR 20 BP 184/111 and sating 94% on RA.  He was noted to
"respond to pain but is restless."  A handwritten sheet of paper
states he had 1000 cc of [**Location (un) 2452**] urine upon foley insertion and
labs notable for "CK 1000, lactate 3.4, Na 133, WBC 13, + etoh,
tox neg."  He received propofol, lidocaine, etomidate,
vecuronium, succinylcholine, ativan, and dilantin 1g.  CT head
showed a midbrain hematoma, SAH, and SDH, and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  He was seen by neurosurgery who
recommended neurology consult.

Past Medical History:
- Recently c/o "migraine-like HA" on left side of face for about
two months. Took unknown med with partial relief.
- History of heavy smoking, cut back recently.
- H/o Emphysema, on some inhaler(s) including albuterol (found
by EMS).
- Borderline hypertension without treatment.

- No prior h/o hospitalization, diabetes, dyslipidemia, no prior
medical complication from EtOH. No known h/o cardiac or
neurologic disease.


Social History:
Patient is visiting from PR, speaks only [**Country 12649**]. Lived at
cousin's house, but left [**2-28**] frequent drunkenness. Still working
at a laundromat in [**Location 17065**]. PCP is [**Name9 (PRE) 1557**] at [**Name9 (PRE) **] Med
Ctr.

Increased EtOH over the past year, up to 24 beers / day on
weekends. Drinks most every day, unsure how much. Moved from
cousin's house to rental with four other people from Central
America [**2-28**] drinking habit. Still smokes, but cut back recently.
No known history of drug abuse.

Family History:
Mom died of colon cancer at 39 years (refused colonoscopy, DRE
at PCP's office). Sister died of breast cancer. Grandfather with
DM, MI. Father (visiting) appears ill/cachectic, but denies Ca
or strokes, etc. Only says "bad circulation" on unknown meds.

Physical Exam:
[**Month/Day (2) **] Examination
Over the course of the admission, his vital signs remained
stable.
Mental status was significant for clarity of cognition - after
transfer to the floor he was clearly able to understand complex
language, instructions and understand complicated information,
all in Spanish. It seems that he cannot understand English. He
was alert, sometime taking a little while to arouse. Although it
is difficult to evaluate his affect fully, he does seem mildly
depressed.
Cranial nerves were significant for impaired eye movement: He
has a vertical skew deviation in mid-position, is able to move
both eyes vertically and can abduct the right eye, without being
able to move the left eye horizontally or adduct the right eye.
There was a left lower motor neuron pattern of facial weakness.

He has an upper motor neuron pattern of weakness on the right,
less so on the left. He can now hold his legs bend against
gravity if the heels are on the bed. He can move both hands with
the left arm antigravity and the right not yet antigravity. The
left hand is clumsy.
He presently cannot sit, let alone stand, without assistance.

Initial head CT [**2119-11-22**]
  There is a 15 x 18 mm intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
midbrain extending down to the basis pontis, level of lower
middle cerebellar peduncle, with surrounding edema which is
essentially unchanged from the recent exam (13 x 18 mm). This is
associated with hemorrhage within the right quadrigeminal plate
and ambient cistern, subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right
occipital lobe and a 6 mm-thick right temporal extra-axial
hematoma. Also noted are multiple punctate foci of high density
at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction in the right frontal lobe (102:52)
and the left frontovertex (102:58-9). While these may represent
cavernous hemangiomas, the presence of multi-compartment
hemorrhage, as well as the edema surrounding edema these foci is
concerning for diffuse axonal injury in the setting of trauma.
  There is an incidental likely arachnoid cyst in teh left
posterolateral aspect of the posterior fossa, with minimal mass
effect on the subjacent cerebellar hemisphere. There is an air-
fluid level in the right maxillary sinus. The remaining sinuses
as well as the mastoid air cells are well aerated. No definite
fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Midbrain/pontine parenchymal, right occipital subarachnoid
and right
temporal extra-axial hemorrhage, as described above.
2. Foci of high attenuation of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction may
represent diffuse axonal injury, although cavernous angiomas are
a possibility.

Repeat Head CT [**2119-12-1**]
1. Hematoma involving the left dorsolateral aspect of the
brainstem at the
pontomesencephalic junction is unchanged from [**2119-11-29**].

2. Right parietal vertex subarachnoid hemorrhage is without
significant change from prior study.

MRI/MRA [**2119-11-22**]
IMPRESSION: 1. Mid brain hemorrhage is identified without
evidence of associated enhancement or abnormal flow voids. 2.
Foci of signal abnormality at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction in
frontal lobes on diffusion images with two asmall area of blood
products in frontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction and associated
small subdural hematoma on the right convexity and tentorium as
well as blood products along the subarachnoid space could be
related to trauma. Clinical correlation recommended.

MRA Head:
Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the arteries of
anterior and
posterior circulation without stenosis, occlusion or an aneurysm
greater than 3 mm in size.
IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRA of the head.
