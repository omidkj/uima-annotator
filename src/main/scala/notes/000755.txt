CT Abd:
LLL PNA
There is a confluent air space opacity within the left lower
lobe consistent with pneumonia. The right lung is grossly clear.
There are no pleural effusions. The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
pancreas, adrenal glands, and right kidney appear grossly
normal. There are at least two (2) tiny low attenuation foci
arising from the left kidney which are too small to characterize
further. Stomach and visualized loops of small and large bowel
are unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or
mesenteric lymph nodes are present. There is no free fluid.

Head CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.

C-spine CT: There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation.
There are numerous cervical lymh nodes seen and thickening of
the adenoidal/nasopharyngeal soft tissues. Clinical correlation
recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 20069**] [**Known lastname 37728**] ia a 20 yo male with h/o bipolar disease,
ADHD, h/o seizures p/w acute hepatitis due to unintentional
percocet overdose.

Acute Hepatitis due to APAP overdose: He was initially admitted
to the SICU where he was evaluated by the liver transplant team.
 Luckily, his ALT/AST trended down with 17 doses of
N-Acetylcysteine from a peak of 22,000/14,00 respectively, and
an INR peak of 6.6.  With his improvement, he was transferred to
the floor on [**4-1**], with continued improvement of his LFT's.  An
abd CT was not surprising, showing expected signs of
inflammation around the liver.  Pt's abdominal pain was
improving on discharge.

Hypertension: in setting of acute hepatitis.  Pt was treated
with clonidine in house with.  Anticipate resolution with
resolution of acute process.

?Bipolar Disease/ADHD: Followed by psychiatry in house.  They
recommend not medically treating his reported diagnoses given pt
could not provide names of any psychiatrists, and the psychiatry
team questioned the pt's diagnoses.  Pt will follow up with
outpatient psychiatry, and was given the number of a psychiatry
practice near his home.

LLL PNA: Likely due to aspiration while pt was acutely sick.  Pt
spiked to 101.9, with evidence of LLL PNA on abd CT.  He was
started on Levo/Flagyl [**4-2**] for 1 week.  He remained comfortable
on room air and afebrile.

? H/O Seizures d/t subdural hemorrhage in setting of CVA in
[**2160**]: Pt reported being on dilantin and depakote for
seizures/mood stabalization.  However, I spoke with both his PCP
and primary neurologist who have no record of him being on
either medication, and no record of him ever having a seizure.
Further, he had an EEG for headaches on [**2163-4-22**] that was normal.
 Pt's dilantin and depakote levels on admission were below
assay.  Pt was not place on either dilantin or depakote.  He
remained seizure free in house and head CT showed no evidence of
subdural hematoma as present three years ago after his car
accident.  He will follow up with outpatient neurology.

Drug seeking behavior: Pt was clearly pain med seeking, being
verbally abusive to staff.  His episode of falling off the
toilet [**4-2**] was likely due to opioid overuse, with no subsequent
evidence of trauma on exam or CT.  With some struggle, we have
negotiated switching him from IV to PO dilaudid.  He will be
d/c'd off dilaudid, with a few oxycodones for breaktrough pain.

Comm: PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8539**], Neuro [**Doctor Last Name 10653**]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 37729**] in [**Location (un) **].

Dispo: Pt was discharge home with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], GI, and neuro
followup plans.
