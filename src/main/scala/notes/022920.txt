spontaneously.  Otherwise he was neurologically intact with
full range of motion, full strength, and full sensation.  No
pronator drift was noted.  Vitals signs were stable.  Visual

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**10-15**], he underwent a cerebral
angiogram which revealed a dissecting fusiform aneurysm of the
superior cerebellar artery and underwent GDC aneurysm coiling
to achieve parent vessel occlusion (PVO) in the Angiography
Suite. He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  Triple
therapy was started with Cardiology input.  He was in rapid
atrial fibrillation in the 140s which was difficult to control
with Labetalol and Amiodarone.  He self-extubated on the 15th and
was subsequently reintubated on [**10-20**] for increased work of
breathing.  He remained in rapid atrial fibrillation, and he
was treated with Diltiazem with some affect.

On the 17th, a PA line was inserted due to hemodynamic
instability.  Cardiac index was found to be 17.  On the next
morning on 18th, a balloon pump was placed for hemodynamic
support.  Low-dose Heparin was also started for
anticoagulation.

He spiked a temperature to 103-104??????.  He did have some
gram-negative rods in his sputum which was treated with a
[**6-12**] day course of antibiotics.  He also had a catheter tip
culture which was positive, but blood cultures were negative,
so that was not treated.  On the 19th, he had some
increasing LFTs.  He had a right upper quadrant ultrasound
which was negative.  His LFTs came down on its own without
treatment.

On the 20th, hemodynamics slowly improved since the balloon
pump was put in, and that was subsequently removed with a
last index of 30.  On the 23rd, he had some bibasilar
vasospasms and was started on Heparin.  On the 27th, he was
extubated and has done well since.

On [**11-5**], he discontinued his vent drain himself, and he
was later transferred to the floor.  On the 4th, he had a
swallow study done, and he passed.  Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy evaluated him, and he will require acute
rehabilitation.
