Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o male s/p segment III resection with Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on
[**2151-6-11**] who was discharged to rehab facility and now returns
with abdominal incision wound infection. His other concerns are
fluid overload and acute on chronic renal failure.
He was initially admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 but was transferred to the
SICU for worsening respiratory status, however he did not
require intubation. Legionella culture was negative. Bubble
study was negative for intracardiac shunt
A wound VAC was placed to the abdominal incision after
completely opening the incision and Vancomycin was started x 3
days. Blood cultures were negative.
Right leg cellulitis was noted on admission and this improved
with the Vancomycin.
LENIs were obtained and negative for DVT.
He was seen in consult by Nephrology and Hepatology. Per both
their recommendations Midodrine and octreotide were added as was
Rifaxamin. With mild volume expansion, the ARF appeared to be
resolving and all diuretics continued to be held.
On [**7-11**] he underwent paracentesis for increasing abdominal pain.
Ultrasound did indicate the presence of ascites. 1.7 liters of
fluid was removed and the WBC was 955 with 79% polys. No
organisms were seen on gram stain and the fluid culture was
reported as no growth. He was started on Zosyn (6 days total)
and the Vancomycin was added back in and dosed per trough
levels.
Nutrition consult was obtained and TPN was initiated via newly
placed PICC line.
He was transfused 2 units RBCs on HD 7 for Hct 28.2 which
dropped 4% from previous day in setting of paracentesis. Hct
remained stable thereafter.
On [**7-14**] a repeat paracentesis was performed and the WBC was now
elevated to 3925 with 70% polys. As this occured while on Zosyn,
the antibiotic was changed to Meropenem, this was per ID
recommendation who was also consulted.
Renal consult service was recommending the initiation of
hemodialysis as his creatinine which initially decreased to 3.3
by HD 5 was increasing daily in the ensuing days.
The patient was transferred to the medical service on [**2151-7-15**]
with the hepatobiliary (West 1 team) following abdominal wound
and VAC changes.

On [**2151-7-16**], the patient was in respiratory distress with
tachypnea and sat-ing at 95% on 5 liters of oxygen.  This was
secondary to fluid overload secondary to liver and renal
failure. Paracentesis with ultrasound was attempted at the
bedside, but very little fluid could be removed.  Fluid was sent
for fungal cultures. To date, all blood, peritoneal, and urine
cultures have been negative.
Hemodialysis line was placed by IR in anticipation of
hemodialysis for fluid overload.  Hemodialysis did not provide
any relief of respiratory symptoms and the patient remained in a
great deal of pain with respiratory distress.
Goals of care were discussed with the patient, his family, and
the PCP (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**], as well as the attending of record, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 7033**]. The patient was made DNR/DNI on [**2151-7-16**].
Clinical status continued to deteriorate on [**2151-7-17**].  On [**2151-7-18**],
the family decided on comfort measures only and all
medications/treatments were discontinued. Mr. [**Known lastname 42058**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
at 15:42 on [**2151-7-18**].
