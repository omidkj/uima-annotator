Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71 M with COPD and restrictive lung disease, CHF, HTN, PAFIB,
Stage IIIa light chain multiple myeloma, multiple admissions and
recent discharge [**2167-11-19**] for ? pna/COPD exacerbation, completed
Velcade therapy for mult myeloma in [**8-27**], subdural hematoma in
[**9-27**], presents with SOB and [**Month/Year (2) **]. His sister went to his house
and thought he looked sicker than usual, with SOB and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
she called EMS and had him brought to the ED. No fever, no
chills, no sore throat, no CP, no abd pain, no peripheral edema.
He has VNA 3x/week, who prepares his medications for the week.
He cannot remember if he has been taking any prednisone, but his
last discharge summary had noted that he was not supposed to be
on any prednisone after his taper.
.
In the ED, ABG 7.29/70/173, he was somnolent on exam, and he was
placed on BIPAP. CXR - no change from prior, patient was
afebrile with WBC 5.6. Second ABG 7.36/68/100 on bipap. He was
given levofloxacin 500 x1 in ED. He completed a 14 day steroid
taper 1 week ago. His last Onc treatment was Velcade, started on
[**2167-8-25**], on days 1, 4, 8, 11, so this was completed a few months
ago. He was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring and
continuing need for bipap.

After stabilizing in ICU, off Bipap and on doing well on RA he
was sent to the medicine floor.


Past Medical History:
1) Multiple myeloma: From prior notes: Diagnosed in [**Month (only) 956**]
[**2164**], Stage IIIA with kappa light chains. He initially responded
well to Decadron and was then intolerant to
thalidomide/Decadron.  Subsequently responded well to
Cytoxan/Decadron. In [**2165-7-24**], he underwent an autologous
SCT after treatment with high-dose melphalan. He went into
remission at this time which he maintained until [**2167-7-24**]
when he presented to the ED with dyspnea on exertion.  At that
time, he was found to have 20 grams of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria
and new diabetes insipidus. A bone marrow biopsy showed >60%
plasma cells. He was pulsed with Decadron and discharged on PO
Decadron for his MM. On [**2167-8-25**], he was started on Velcade (in
addition to his [**Hospital1 **] Decadron).
2. Diabetes insipidus: Diagnosed during [**2167-7-24**]
hospitalization, + water deprivation test and response to ddAVP
(thus, likely central).
3. Hypertension
4. Restrictive/Obstructive lung disease: Followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Had a pulmonary stress test in [**2167-6-23**] with
findings suggestive more of cardiac disease limiting his
exercise tolerance, rather than pulmonary disease, however he
does have both restrictive and obstructive lung disease.
5. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
6. Hypercholesterolemia
7. Osteoarthritis status post bilateral knee replacements in
[**2160**], [**2161**].
8. MVA [**2147**]--> Multiple bilateral fractured ribs, lumbar
diskectomy
9. Subdural hematoma in [**2167-9-23**].

Social History:
Divorced, lives alone. Sister lives nearby and helps with [**Name (NI) 4461**].
Has home nurse who comes in daily. [**Name (NI) 8735**] meat worker,
originally from [**Doctor Last Name 15076**]. Denies history of tobacco, alcohol use.

Non-contrast chest CT.

FINDINGS: Images are very limited by motion. There is stable
scarring versus atelectasis at the right lung base. There is a
stable area of plate-like opacity in the lateral portion of the
lingula anterior to the major fissure that may represent
atelectasis or scarring. There is new linear atelectasis at the
left lung base. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There are stable small mediastinal lymph nodes, notably a 6 mm
prevascular node and a 9 mm right peritracheal node. There are
coronary artery calcifications. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Limited images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

Bone windows again demonstrate diffuse osseous abnormality
consistent with the patient's history of multiple myeloma.

IMPRESSION: Stable scarring/atelectasis at the right lung base
with no pleural effusion. Stable scarring or atelectasis in the
lingula anterior to the major
fissure.

Portable semi upright view.

FINDINGS: Mildly enlarged heart is unchanged in appearance.
Mediastinal countour is unremarkable. Hilar contours look
prominent with slight upper zone redistribution. Poor
inspiratory effort with low lung volumes is unchanged. The
opacity in the right lung base is unchanged. This might be due
to pesistent effusion/infiltrate. Multiple bilateral healing rib
fractures are unchanged. Incidental note is made of severe
osteoarthritic changes of the left glenohumeral joint and right
acromioclavicular joint.

IMPRESSION:

1. Slight prominence of pulmonary hila and upper zone
redistribution suggests mild heart failure.

2.The opacity at right lung base is stable and might suggest
persistent pleural thickening.

2. Unchanged appearance of multiple healing rib fractures.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2167-12-14**]  5:22:50 AM


Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat. Short P-R interval.
Left ventricular
hypertrophy. Non-specific T wave changes in leads I and aVL.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2167-12-13**] atrial premature beats is new and
bradycardia is
absent.




Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea - The patient has had 3 hospitalizations in the past 2
months with similar symptoms. This time a CXR and CT chest did
not reveal any new abnormality. No pneumonia/CHF signs. The
patient is a non-smoker. ECHO recently showed normal EF, he
could have some diast dysfunction, but did not appear to be in
HF this time. after stabilization in the ICU he was sent to the
floor, where he
