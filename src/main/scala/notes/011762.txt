History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74191**] is a 38 year-old man with no significant past medical
history presents with 1 week of URI likely symptoms with acutely
worsened 2 days of malaise with fever, cough, shortness of
breath. The patient developed fever to 102 at home yesterday. He
reports fainting twice yesterday, once while going to the
kitchen and again walking to the bathroom last night. He also
noted diarrhea last night with one episode of vomiting without
hematemesis. This morning the patient continued to have
lightheadedness and chills prompting presentation to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
ED.

In the BIDN ED, initial vs were 97.4 78 74/44 18 98%RA. His WBC
was 20K with 68% PMN with 13 bands. Rapid flu swab was negative
and blood culture x2 was obtained. His lactate was initially
elevated at 7.3 that after 4L NS somewhat improved to 5.9 and
blood pressure improved to systolic in the 90s and MAPs in the
40s. Given refractory hypotension after fluid resuscitation, a
right internal jugular central venous line was placed under
sterile conditions without complication. CVP upon insertion is
high at 18. Echocardiogram showed good ventricular function
without evidence of effusion. CXR identified RML consolidation.
He received Vanc/Azithro/Ceftriaxone and a levophed drip was
started. The patient was then transferred by med flight to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for further care.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was awake and alert and was breathing
comfortably O2 sat in the mid 90s on 100% NRB with MAPs in the
80s. WBC was elevated to 17.3 with 89% PMNs and 8% bands and
lactate was 3.8. He received an additional 2.5L of NS and was
admitted to the MICU. Vitals on transfer were 76 128/91 22 99%
on 100% NRB.

On the floor, the patient is appears comfortable and is without
additional complaint.

Echocardiogram [**2124-12-19**]:
  The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The estimated cardiac index is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is abnormal septal motion/position. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

  Normal left ventricular cavity size with mildly depressed
global systolic function. Abnormal septal motion. No pericardial
effusion.

Cardiac Catheterization [**2124-12-20**]:
1. No atherosclerotic disease.
2. Generalized slow flow (particularly in spastic OM2 and 3
branches)
that improved with IC NTG and IC Nicardipine.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 38 year-old man who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] in
the setting of severe spesis and septic shock and pneumonia
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] MICU who improved with fluid
resusciation and pressor support but developed chest pain and
NSTEMI on [**12-19**].

#. Septic shock: The patient presented to [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] with
lactate of 7.3 that required a total of 7L of NS and a Levofed
drip. He was quickly weaned off pressors and his lactate
improved to 3.4 on admission to the MICU. Blood cultures grew
gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters that speciated to
pan-sensitive pneumococcus. He will complete a 14 day antibiotic
course as an outpatinet.

#. Severe Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient reports one week of URI
like symptoms with cough and malaise that acutely worsened with
high fever to 102 overnight. Rapid flu swab at BIDN was
negative. CXR at BIDN revealed right middle lobe PNA. Patient
received CTX/Azithro at BIDN. He was started on vancomycin,
ceftriaxone and azithromycin on admission to the MICU. His blood
culture grew Streptococcus Pneumoniae that was pan-sensitive. He
was switched to Levaquin on [**2124-12-21**] and discharged with a
plan to complete a 14 day course on [**2125-1-1**].

#. Chest pain/Coronary Vasospasm: On the morning on [**12-19**],
patient developed chest pain that was improved with sitting
forward. EKG showed non-contiguous ST elevations initially
suggestive of pericarditis. He was given morphine 2 mg iv x 1
and ibuprofen 800 mg po without releif. His chest pain resolved
after 1.5 hours. Repeat EKG showed improvement in ST changes.
Cardiac enzymes became elevated to troponin 1.25, CK-MB 53. He
was then started on a heparin drip, aspirin 325 mg po daily,
metoprolol 12.5 mg po TID and loaded with plavix 600 mg po.
Echocardiogram showed mildly depressed global systolic function
and abnormal septal motion and no pericardial effusion. Cardiac
