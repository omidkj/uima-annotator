History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 4317**] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 84 year-old woman with chronic
renal failure, colon cancer s/p resection, hypertension, and
diastolic dysfunction with shortness of breath. She reports one
week of SOB and worsening DOE. Her daughter notes that she has
not been the same as far as her exercise tolerance since
breaking her left ankle 3 months ago though her PT over the past
months has not been limited by pain until now.
.
Note is made that at the end of [**Month (only) 956**], she was admitted with
a pneumonia treated with levofloxacin. She was dischaged to
[**Hospital 38**] Rehab but has been home subsequently. She reports that
she was discharged on oxygen but has been off for approx 2
weeks.
.
Initial VS in the ED: 99.6, 150/59, 85, 19, 79% on NRB. She had
a WBC of 11.4 and a BNP of 8000. Labs were significant for a
lactate of 2.4 and an AG of 21. She had a CXR which showed
pulmonary edema and multiple opacifications. Given Vancomycin 1G
IV, Levofloxacin 750mg IV X1, ASA 325mg X1 EKG SR at 81, LAD,
1st degree HB, ST dep I, avL present from prior, .5-1 mm dep
V4-V6. She was seen by cards who said to give ASA only. She had
LENIs which the prelim were negative for DVT. VS on transfer
were: 6L NC 92-94%, HR 83, 147/64.
.
In the medical floor she was started on treatment for healthcare
acquired pneumonia with Vanc/levofloxacin (day 1 [**3-27**]). Her urine
legionella was negative. Her initial lactate was 2.4 and it
imrpoved to 1.6 after hydration. She received 20 mg of IV lasix.

.
At 7:35 AM she triggered for hypoxia. Her vital signs were HR 78
BPM, BP 120/69 mmHg, RR 22, T 97.3, 85% on 3 L NC. She was
diuresed with 20 mg of IV lasix x1. Her BNP was 8012, CXR [**Last Name (un) **]
bilateral alveolar infiltrates and echocardiogram worsening
diastolic dysfunciton with EF of 55% and moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 114**]e TR as well as moderate pulmonary hypertension. She was
ROMI with three sets of CE with peak Trop T of 0.12 and CK 100
with MB of 8. Her creatinine was slightly increased to 2.7 from
her baseline of 2.5. She has continued to have a mild AG
metabolic acidosis. She has received a total of 80 mg of IV
lasix with good response in UOP (1900, 1000 net negative). At
10:37 PM she trigered for lower SpO2 with sats of 86% on NRB.
ABG was 7.53/31/61 at FiO2 of 50% and did not change with higher
SpO2 of 100% in NRB at 7.49/31/61. CXR showed worsening edema.
Pt received Bumetanide 2 mg IV X2 and antibiotics were broadened
to Vanc/Zosyn. She was transfered to ICU.

TTE:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Diastolic function
could not be assessed. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT CHEST:
Axial imaging makes it clear that the process is generalized
relatively symmetric from side to side and more severe in the
dependent, i.e., posterior lungs. The morphology of the
abnormality is not unif
