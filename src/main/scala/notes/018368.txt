Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6088**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
GENERAL SURGERY: [**2167-1-4**]
1. Inferior vena cava filter
2. Exploratory laparotomy with extensive enterolysis
3. Drainage of retroperitoneal hematoma.
4. Hartmann resection of the sigmoid colon with end-descending
colostomy and Hartmann pouch.
VASCULAR SURGERY: [**2167-1-5**]
Axillary-bifemoral graft

History of Present Illness:
80F s/p multiple endovascular procedures at OSH complicated by
retroperitoneal hematoma, transferred for additional care, now
with persistent abdominal distension. Patient was transferred on
[**2165-12-24**] after prolonged course at OSH requiring multiple
endovascular and open surgical procedures for left common iliac
aneurysm and associated complications of retroperitoneal
hematoma and femoral embolus. During this course, patient had
intermittent episodes of abdominal pain and nausea, but not very
bothersome. Patient reports that prior to her surgeries, she
visited the ER several times for abdominal pain and nausea, with
occasional vomiting of bilious fluid. She has never required NG
decompression for management of these episodes. During her
current admission, CT scan performed to evaluate her hematoma
and surgical sites revealed significant small bowel dilation.
Her abdomen was noted to be distended, however she was not
nauseated or in pain. A concurrent work up for possible
periampullary mass prompted NGT placement for decompression and
subsequent ERCP. However, since placement on [**2165-12-25**], the patient
has had persistently high bilious NG output, averaging
approximately a liter daily. She remains without abdominal pain.
She has not had a bowel movement in at least 5 days and starting
passing a very small amount of flatus today. She has been NPO
and on TPN. She denies recent constipation, change in stool
caliber, melena, and
malaise. She had a normal colonscopy 5 years ago. She feels
weakened and depressed by her prolonged course.

Afib, hydronephrosis, diastolic CHF, L common iliac aneurysm,
HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD, breast cancer s/p mastectomy, chronic
nausea and bloating

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 84273**] is an 80-year old female transferred from an OSH
after multiple endovascular procedures for left common iliac
aneurysm and associated complications of retroperitoneal
hematoma complicated by retroperitoneal hematoma and femoral
embolus, transferred for additional care.

Patient had a prolonged ileus and intestinal, colonic and left
ureteral compression by the hematoma, finally requiring an
exploratory laparotomy with Hartmann's procedure.

On POD1 patient had acute ischemia to bilateral lower
extremities and CTA showing occlusion of the aortobifem graft,
needing to go emergently to the OR for ax-bifem
bypass graft to revascularize the lower extremities.

Postoperatively patient did poorly with persistent pressor
requirements, progressive renal failure, liver failure and
possibly a spinal cord infarct not able to move the lower
extremities.

On POD 3 from the last operation patient was not making
substancial improvements and given the multiorgan failure and
poor overall prognosis, the family decided to make her CMO.

Patient was extubated on [**2167-1-8**] in the afternoon and died about
12 hours later on [**2167-1-9**] at 02:25 am. Report of death was
completed.

Patient's family (daughter) were at the bedside and notified.
The admitting office was notified and no need for a Medical
Examiner call was necessary.

The family did not ask for an autopsy.
