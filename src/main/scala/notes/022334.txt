Brief Hospital Course:
1. MICU course for respiratory distress post-operatively: The
pt. underwent repair of her left foot by the podiatry service on
[**2121-10-4**]. She tolerated the procedure well but was noted to be
hypotensive during the procedure.  On arrival to the floor, the
pt. was noted to be hypoxic to 80% on 40% face tent but this was
determined to be secondary to the fact that she was not on her
BiPAP machine which she uses for OSA.  On hospital day #2
(post-operative day #1), the pt. was noted to have a potassium
of 6.7 and a creatinine of 2.3 on routine labs.  An EKG was
obtained and showed inverted T waves in leads I, aVL and V2-V6.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn and the first set were mildly
elevated. The pt. remained asymptomatic, at no time complaining
of chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea or
vomiting. A cardiology consult was called.  They felt that this
episode represented demand ischemia in the setting of her
medical illness in this pt. with multiple cardiac risk factors
including DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia.  She was started on
heparin, aspirin, and a beta blocker.  Her third set of enzymes
were negative and heparin was discontinued.  She was maintained
on aspirin, a beta blocker and a statin for the remainder of the
hospitalization. As the pt. became more lethargic, hypotensive
and hypoxic, she was transferred to the MICU for further care.
In the MICU, where the pt. remained for a total of 2 days, the
pt. was treated for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
on BiPAP.  Her oxygen saturations remained acceptable throughout
the course of her MICU stay.  It was felt that her respiratory
distress was related to OSA, COPD and over-medication with
morphine post-operatively.  Also over the course of her MICU
stay, her acute on chronic renal failure improved with the
administration of fluids.  It was felt that her ARF was prerenal
in etiology.  She had an echocardiogram on [**2121-10-30**] which showed
mild RA, LA and LV dilatation and an LVEF > 55%.
On hospital day 5, she was judged to be stable for the floor as
her hypoxemia had resolved and she was not in respiratory
distress.  The remainder of her hospital course is detailed
below:

2. Left foot infection: On hospital day 6, the podiatry service
felt that the pt. was developing an infection at the incision
site on her left foot.  Unasyn was empirically begun.  The pt.
was taken to the OR for debridement of the left foot wound on
[**2121-11-5**] by the podiatry service.  The pt. tolerated the
procedure well.  A culture of the wound was taken during the
procedure.  This culture subsequently grew pseudomonas species
and MRSA.  Accordingly, the pt. was placed on zosyn and
vancomycin.  A PICC line was placed by interventional radiology
on [**2121-11-10**] in anticipation of discharge and the need for an
extended course of intravenous antibiotics.

3. Hypertension: The pt's. blood pressure was noted to be
relatively low towards the end of her hospitalization.
Accordingly, her antihypertensive regimen was tailored.  She was
discharged on 5mg of lisinopril once/day and 12.5mg of
metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].

4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The pt. was noted to have
persistently elevated fingerstick glucose levels.  She was
maintained on a sliding scale of regular insulin.  At the end of
her hospitalization, she was started on 2.5mg of glipizide [**Hospital1 **]
for glycemic control.

5. NSTEMI: Please see the details of the pt's myocardial
infarction above.  She was maintained on aspirin, a beta blocker
and a statin.  It is recommended that she undergo cardiac stress
testing once she is able to tolerate the study after she
completes rehabilitation for her left foot.

6. Pulmonary fibrosis & nodules: The pt. was noted to have
evidence of pulmonary fibrosis and upper lobe nodules on a
previous CT scan; these need to be followed closely given her
significant tobacco hx as well as h/o breast ca. She is to
follow-up with the pulmonology service after discharge.
