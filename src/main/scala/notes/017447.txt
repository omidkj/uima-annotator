Chief Complaint:
Dysphagia - Myasthenia crisis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 39733**] is a 58 yo woman with DM, ESRD on dialysis, DM, CHF
and diagnosis of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] presenting with worsening
dysphagia and weakness for the past 10 days.

Patient has diagnosis of [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 69836**] [**Last Name (un) 2902**] since [**2142**] (see below
PMH for diagnosis history), having had 2 crisis with respiratory
distress in the past and several admission for plasmapheresis.
Patient has been tried on several medications including
corticosteroids, cellcept and cytoxan. Patient is poorly
compliant to treatment, she often misses her appointments and
she has been off medications for the past 2 months.

Patient reports that for the past 10 days she has had
progressive dysphagia, she chokes drinking water and has not
been able to take pills PO. She also reports that her legs have
been weaker, not being able to walk for the past few days. She
denied diplopia, ptosis or respiratory distress.

Patient was seen in [**Hospital 69837**] clinic by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1104**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4638**]
and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who recommended for her admission for
plasmapherisis.

In ER, patient had  NIF -20/-15, VC 1 L in ED with poor effort

Past Medical History:
1. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: diagnosed with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] in [**2142**]
with a presentation with ptosis and episodic double vision.  She
subsequently developed dysarthria, dysphagia, and mild neck and
limb weakness, and was initially evaulated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
the [**State 1558**], [**Hospital1 1559**].  Her work-up
included
acteylcholine receptor antibodies which were positive.
Initially,
she was treated with high-dose prednisone at 80 mg a day.  The
patient stated that on this dose of prednisone, she had an
increase in her serum glucoses that were difficult to control
because of her type 2 diabetes.  She was then started on trials
of various steroid-sparing agents, complicated by side effects,
and has included:
a. IV Cytoxan, which she stated that she did not tolerate
because
of diarrhea.
b. CellCept, which she could not tolerate because she could not
swallow it.
c. she thinks she has tried cyclosporine in the past as well Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] eventually put her on Imuran, which she has been on for
the last 12 years.

2. Poorly controlled diabetes
3. ESRD
4. Neuropathy
5. HTN
6. Congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 58 year old RHW with DM, ESRD on dialysis, DM, CHF
and diagnosis of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] in [**2142**] presenting with
worsening dysphagia and weakness for the past 10 days after
being off medications for the past 2 months due to running out
of her meds.  Patient reports not being able to swallow solids
nor to walk at home for the past few days but denied dyspnea,
double vision or ptosis. Patient is poorly compliant to
treatment. Neurological exam remarkable for weakness in lower
extremities and in the ER, patient had  NIF -20/-15, VC 1 L in
ED with poor effort.

She was admitted to ICU initially given her serious condition
and the possibility for need for intubation.  She was monitored
closely and was followed per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/[**Doctor Last Name 4638**] throughout this
admission.  She was started on plasmapheresis on [**10-11**] - morning
after admission using her HD catheter and renal followed her as
well for her ESRD and HD.  She was urgently dialyzed on [**10-11**]
after plasmapheresis.  She tolerated both well without
respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability.  She was
continued on Imuran (50mg [**Hospital1 **]) and Mestinon 15mg daily.  She was
also started on prednisone (1mg/kg/day = 45mg/day).  NIF and VC
were checked every 3~4 hrs and continued to improved especially
after the 1st round of plasmapheresis.

She was transferred to Neuro Step down on [**10-12**] given that she
was more stable.  She received 5 cycles of plasmapheresis every
other day and continued to get HD as recommended per renal who
also recommended an echo which showed preserved ventricular
function (LVEF > 55%) but mild pulm HTN with PCWP > 18mmHg.

Upon admission to the neurology team she had improved strength
but was refusing to take her mediactions PO.  He imuran and
steroids were changed to IV.  She continued to have her NIF's
and VC checked on a
