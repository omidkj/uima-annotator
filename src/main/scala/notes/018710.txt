(Focused views) Done [**2189-1-16**] at 11:37:07 PM      FINAL

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis to akinesis of the anterior, septal and
distal/apical segments (proximal LAD territory). The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 25-30%). No left ventricular
thrombus seen. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
Limited emergency study.

There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with LVEF 25%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w LAD-territory infarction. Mild mitral and
aortic regurgitation. Minimal change in cardiac output during
inotrope and IABP weaning.

IMPRESSION:

1. Streak artifact from an intra-aortic balloon pump markedly
limits
evaluation of the lower descending thoracic aorta and abdominal
aorta, though
no overt abnormality. There is atherosclerotic disease in the
abdominal aorta
and common iliac arteries.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis and likely
aspiration.

3. 1.4 x 0.8 cm nonspecific renal lesion for which further
evaluation with
MRI is recommended (as clinically indicated).

IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening perihilar edema with worsening bilateral moderate
pleural
effusions and moderate bibasilar atelectases.
2. New left lower lobe opacity is concerning for atelectasis or
pneumonia in
the correct clinical setting.
