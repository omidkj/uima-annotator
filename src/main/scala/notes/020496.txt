[**11-15**]: Blood cx: [**1-14**] coag neg staph
[**11-16**]: Sputum cx:  SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA. Moderate
growth yeast.
[**11-16**]: Urine cx: negative
[**11-16**]: Urine legionella ag: negative
[**11-16**]: Serum cyptococcal ag: negative
[**11-17**]: HIV VL < 48 copies/ml

Studies:
CT abd/Pelvis [**2134-11-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. New left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
Lesser changes at right base.
2. Partially obstructing right ureteral stone with mild
associated right ureter hydronephrosis, improved compared to the
CT of [**2134-8-20**].
3. No evidence of gallbladder pathology or acute left lower
quadrant process.

CT head [**2134-11-15**]: Multiple low-attenuation areas likely
reflective of underlying lesions within the left cerebellar
hemisphere, left mid brain, and possibly within the temporal
lobe. MRI is recommended to further delineate these findings. No
acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CXR [**2134-11-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Opacification in the left lower lobe consistent with
pneumonia, probably post-obstructive, with associated
atelectasis. There is likely a second area of involvement in the
right middle lobe as well. Followup after treatment is
recommended to ensure resolution.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST (MAGNEVIST) [**2134-11-16**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited by motion. No definite temporal lobe abnormality.
2. Probably stable focus of enhancement in the left midbrain.
3. Maxillary sinus disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) PNA: CXR upon admission showed opacification on LLL and RML
consistent with pneumonia. Patient was admitted to MICU for SBP
97, O2 89 on 2L, and somnolence. Had GPC in 1 blood cx and GNR
on sputum gram stain. He was started on ceftraxone 1g IV,
levofloxacin 750 mg IV and vancomycin 1000mg IV (for the gram
pos bacteremia). ID was consulted. His mental status returned to
baseline per wife, and he was transferred to floor. Sputum ended
up growing yeast and OP flora. [**1-14**] blood cx remained positive
for coag neg Staph, presumed contaminant. Due to these results,
he was narrowed to levofloxacin alone. He remained afebrile on
this regimen and his shortness of breath resolved.

2) AMS: Patient was initially somnolent and CT head showed
attenuation in left cerebellar hemisphere and possibly in
temporal lobe, concerning for toxo or CNS lymphoma. MRI head
follow-up showed no abnormal signal for lesions in the left
temporal lobe. Serum Cryptococcal antigen was negative. His
mental status improved as above.

3) Oral Thrush: Started on Fluconazole 200 mg X 7 days for oral
thrush. Will continue as outpatient.

4) Elevated Bilirubin: Total bilirubin of 4.7 was noted as
outpatient in [**Hospital **] clinic 3 days PTA. On admission Total Bilirubin
was 2.1, direct bilirubin normal at 0.8, however low suspicion
for hemolysis as retic count normal (1.2) and haptoglobin
elevated at 440. CT A/P without biliary pathology. Total
bilirubin normalized over the course, 2.1-->2.2-->1.5, normal at
discharge. Consider [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome as etiology.

5) Elevated INR: INR was 2.3 on admission and heparin DVT
propylaxis was initially held. Thought to be nutritional.
Resolved to 1.3 with vitamin K.

6) HIV: Maintained on current HAART regimen. CD4 was 207 with
undetectable viral load. Atazanavir was initially held due to
elevated bili, but restarted prior to discharge.
