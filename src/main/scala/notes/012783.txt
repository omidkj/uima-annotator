Allergies:
vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization

History of Present Illness:
66M patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who presented to the [**Hospital1 **] ED today c/o
poor UOP for 3 days.  He states that his weight this morning was
192 which is high for him and he states that he has been as low
as 172.  Weights in our system are difficult to follow, and the
patient has readings of many  He notes that he has had a normal
bowel movement this morning and has never noticed red blood
around stool, red blood in the toilet bowl, or black-tarry
stools.  He explicitly denies CP, or an increase in his baseline
shortness of breath.  He states this morning he was getting
light-headed with changes in position, however this has resolved
at this time.
.
Of note he was changed from lasix to torsemide [**6-24**] but the
patient feels this didnt work as well as his lasix and that he
has been gaining weight. He states he took two doses of his old
lasix yesterday without effect.
.
In the ED his initial vitals were 97.6 70 88/52 16 100% and
given his low MAPs, he received 2 units of pRBCs, and 2L IVF.
With that His systolics were noted to be in the low 100's.  A
foley cathter was placed and returned 50cc of uirne.  Rectal
exam revealed bright red blood.  2 peripheral 18G IVs were
placed.  The patient briefly endorsed respiratory distress, and
cxr was checked revealing a mild increase in interstitial edema
and 160mg of IV lasix were given with 100cc of UOP and
resolution of symptoms.
.
For unclear reasons, the patient was given Zosyn and vancomycin.
 Durring the infusion of vancomycin he developed hives on his
arm and the infusion was stopped.
.
On arrival to the floor the patient is clear, not complaining of
any dyspnea, and feels very comfortable.

Pertinent studies:
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast ([**2122-6-30**]):
1. Trace perihepatic fluid noted tracking along the right
paracolic gutter as well as trace retroperitoneal fluid and a
small amount of simple pelvic fluid. Overall this is
nons-specfic and may be related to IV hydration status.
2. [**Doctor First Name **] mesentery noted in the upper part of the abdomen, a
nonspecific
finding though new compared to prior studies. Follow up in 6
months is
advised.
3. Bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
4. Right lower lobe 5mm pulmonary nodule. Recommend non-emergent
chest CT to assess for other possible pulmonary nodules and
establish frequency of
surveillance.
5. Extensive vascular calcifications.

TTE ([**2122-7-1**]): The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the
interventricular septum and anterior wall (LVEF= 20-25 %). The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study dated [**2122-1-8**] (images reviewed),
the degree of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse. Pulmonary
pressures are higher. LVEF is similar.

Renal ultrasound ([**2122-7-1**]):
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 9.8 cm and the left kidney
measures 10.1 cm. There is no hydronephrosis. No cyst or stone
or solid mass is seen in either kidney.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.

        PVR 3.9 to 1.3
        C/I 3.5 to 3.9
        PCWP 34 to 42

Brief Hospital Course:
66M with CAD s/p CABG, VF arrest s/p AICD, ischemic CMP (EF
20-25%), AF/flutter s/p ablation with recent admission for acute
systolic CHF with aggressive diuresis admitted with hypotension
and [**Last Name (un) **].

# Hypotension: Suspect hypovolemic shock in the setting of GI
bleeding vs. efficatious response to torsemide.  The patient
responded well to volume.  Symptoms not consistent with
cardiogenic shock given his excellent oxygenation, very mild
insterstitial marking, and baseline pro-BNP.  In addition,
echocardiogram performed on HD1 was not consistent with
cardiogenic shock. The patient did not meet any SIRS criteria
currently as he was without fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia or
tachypnea throughout admission. Pt was fluid/volume responsive
in the ED with pressures rising into the low 100's systolic
after 2uPRBC and 2L IVF.  He received a total of 4UPRBC and
pressures improved.  Metoprolol, torsemide and flomax were held
initially.  Metoprolol and torsemide were restarted on HD4 as
blood pressures were stable and patient began to appear volume
overloaded with increased weight, fluid wave in abdomen,
