ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 68-year-old gentleman who was
in his usual state of health until early [**2099-8-19**] when he
developed dyspnea. CXR revealed a large right-sided pleural
effusion. CT torso on [**2099-8-24**] showed a large right pleural
effusion. It also revealed a 2.3 cm RML nodule and pleural
studding. A 9-cm mixed attenuation mass was seen in the mid
portion of the right kidney, extending laterally into the left
renal vein. There were no focal liver abnormalities and no
adenopathy. Thoracentesis on [**2099-8-24**] drained 1.4 L of bloody
pleural fluid. Cytology was negative. He was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2099-9-1**] and was admitted on [**2099-9-5**] for recurrent pleural
effusion. He underwent thoracentesis which was negative for
malignancy and bronchoscopy which revealed no endobronchial
lesions. He returned on [**2099-9-9**] for an elective thoracoscopy,
pleural biopsy, talc pleurodesis, and pleurex catheter
placement.  Pathology from the pleural biopsy showed metastatic
poorly differentiated carcinoma with clear cell features. He was
then readmitted on [**2099-9-15**] with a severe drug rash, felt to be
due to dilaudid. His pleurex catheter was removed on [**2099-9-15**].
He underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy on [**2099-9-21**] and pathology
revealed renal cell carcinoma, conventional clear cell type,
grade II, greatest dimension 7.5cm. Tumor extended into
perinephric tissues and renal vein. Margins at Gerota's fascia
were positive for tumor. Papillary adenomas were also seen. No
lymph nodes were sent for review. He initially enrolled in
clinical trial 04-117, with the goal of creating a dendritic
cell + tumor fusion vaccine, but he had radiographic and
clinical signs of disease progression so was taken off trial. He
was admitted for hypercalcemia from [**11-13**] to [**11-15**]. He enrolled
in clinical trial 08-219, comparing pazopanib vs. sunitinib for
locally advanced or metastatic RCC, on [**2099-11-17**] and was
randomized to receive pazopanib. Treatment was held from
[**2100-1-19**] to [**2100-2-2**] for grade 3 elevation in his ALT (grade 2 in
AST). He was restarted at 600mg daily when his LFTs normalized.
His pazopanib was on hold from [**7-9**] thru [**2100-7-28**] because he
needed urgent dental surgery including bone removal. During this
time he had rapid growth of an intramuscular lesion on the right
chest wall.

Past Medical History:
-Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
-History of recurrent malignant pleural effusion, S/P right
pleurodesis.
-Right chest wall pain as well as dyspnea and worsening disease

in the right lung.
-Hypthyroidism, started on levothyroxine two days ago
-Hypertension
-Severe dermatitis reaction, which was thought secondary to
Ancef prior to his pleuroscopy

from customer service.

Chest CT:
1. Worsening right lung consolidation since the prior
examination, with
stable appearance of pleural abnormalities. Soft tissue
components of pleural abnormality cannot be differentiated from
pleural fluid without contrast.
2. Slight enlargement of now trace-to-small left pleural
effusion with associated left lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Sift tissue abnormalities of the left chest and upper
abdominal wall as previously noted.
.
Echo:
poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not
well seen but may be dilated and hypokinetic. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
.
US of RUE, and LE bl neg for DVT.



Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o gentleman with metastatic renal cell cancer to lungs who
presents with acute on chronic fatigue and SOB admitted to ICU.
.
#. Anemia: Ptaient received 2 units pRBC in the ED for a hct of
23.7.  Hemolysis work up was negative, and guaic negative.  An
iron panel showed iron deficiency. Pelvic fluid collection was
noted on CT, otherwise there were no obvious sources of
bleeding.  Subsequently his hct remained stable between 26-29.
Patient did not require further transfusions throughout hospital
course.
- Please check weekly CBC; transfuse for hct <21
.
#. Hypotension/Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient was initially
transfered to medical ICU for monitoring.  His hypotension was
thought to be secondary to sepsis in the setting of pneumonia.
The differential diagnosis included hemorrhagic shock given the
pelvic fluid collection noted on CT. However, the patient's
hematocrit remained stable.  In the ICU the patient initially
required norepinephrine for blood pressure support but was
weaned off of this on [**2100-9-19**]. Otherwise, the patient's blood
presure was supported with IV fluids and by holding his home
antihypertensives. The patient was treated with vancomycin,
Zosyn, and ciprof
