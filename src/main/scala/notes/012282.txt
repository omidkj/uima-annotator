Pertinent Results:
[**2187-11-7**] ECHO
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

Post Bypass: Preserved biventricular function. LVEF >55%. There
is a prosthesis in the ascending aorta into the arch with a
normal flow profile. Descending aorta and distal arch unchanged.
No evidence for aortic dissection. Flow is seen in the left main
coronary artery. The arotic valve opens normall with normal flow
profiles, no AS, no AI, normal gradients and no perivalvular
leaks. MR remains trace. Remaining exam is unchanged. All
findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
