Admission Date:  [**2190-9-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2190-10-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2113-3-5**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Plastic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for squamous
cell carcinoma of the mouth with T2 N0 staging, status post
interstitial catheter placement in [**2188-7-18**] for
brachy therapy for recurrent cancer, status post resection,
now presenting with postoperative osteoradionecrosis of the
mandible which had previously been treated with 30 sessions
with hyperbaric oxygen.

However, the patient was still left with a large defect which
was initially closed with a inferior based FAMM flap; but
ultimately the patient developed a right pathologic
mandibular fracture with osteonecrosis of the right mandible.
She presents for free fibular graft to repair the resected
necrotic mandible.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past Medical History significant for
hypothyroidism and reflux disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   As above.  She has also had a
jejunostomy tube placed.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications included Levoxyl.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, she
was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The remainder of the
physical examination was notable for a shift of the
mandibular midline secondary to loss of support of the right
mandibular body with a large separation of the fracture
region with concomitant buckle and facial swelling overlying
the area.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**9-20**] for
planned free fibular graft.  Please see the Operative Note
(per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13797**]) for details of this operation.

She was monitored in the initial 24-hour period with every
two hour flap checks by Cook catheter for venous pulsations
as well as arterial Doppler flows.  Her graft remained stable
during this time.  She was ultimately changed to every four
hour checks and eventually to every eight hour checks.

Immediately following the surgery, she was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for the above-stated monitoring  of her
flap.  She was started on trophic gastrojejunostomy tube
feeds at 10 cc per hour and was maintained on Kefzol and
Flagyl for postoperative infectious prophylaxis.

Her postoperative Intensive Care Unit stay was complicated by
post surgical anemia as well as Pseudomonas pneumonia without
clinical evidence; requiring treatment with ciprofloxacin.
During her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was
maintained in a flat position to prevent development of
fistula as gravity would pull the saliva to the back of her
throat, and a flat position opposed to the floor of her mouth
in an upright or partially upright position.

The patient was ultimately transferred to the floor on
[**2190-9-29**].  She did extremely well on the floor.  She
also had a swallow study obtained just prior to her
discharge; the results of which indicated poor oral transit
with aspiration; however, there was no evidence of fistula.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home with [**Hospital6 3429**] services.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications included)
1.  Aspirin 325 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube q.d.
2.  Levothyroxine 50 mcg per gastrojejunostomy tube q.d.
3.  Sertraline 50 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube q.d.
4.  Famotidine 20 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube b.i.d.
5.  Roxicet 5 cc to 10 cc per gastrojejunostomy tube q.4-6h.
as needed.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient was also instructed to cycle her tube feeds
with ProMod with fiber full strength at 120 cc per hour from
8 p.m. to 8 a.m.
2.  Per [**Hospital6 407**] she would receive dressing
changes as well as assistance with medication and her tube
feeds.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   Follow-up plans were scheduled with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 13797**] as well as with Otolaryngology.
