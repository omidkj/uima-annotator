Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 yo female with PMH significant for CABG, CAD,
Type 2 DM, and ESRD who presented to the ED at [**Hospital3 417**] on
[**12-5**] for chest pain, [**11-6**], with radiation to the neck and left
arm. She states that the pain started earlier that day with no
relief with sublingual nitroglycerin. Denies any prior episodes.
Pain associated with nausea but no SOB or vomiting. She called
911 and was taken to the ED via ambulance. During this time she
was given morphine, started on a nitro gtt and had complete
relief of her chest pain.

In the ED EKG showed ST depression in the inferior leads and
V2-V6. No vitals are available. Inital labs: Hct 41.6, Plt 255,
INR 2.2, Cr 6.4. Cardiac enzymes as follows: 1)CPK 52 CKMB 6 RI
11.5 Trop I 0.55
2)CPK 585 CKMB 122.2 RI 20.9 Trop I 9.89 3)CPK 658 CKMB 177 RI
26.9 Trop I 22.63. Plan was for pt to transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization but given limited bed availability she
was admitted to the CCU at [**Hospital3 417**] and was started on
Heparin gtt, Nitro gtt, and given Morphine PRN for pain. While
her chest pain has resided she continues to have jaw pain.
Coumadin was d/c'ed given elevated INR.

[**2136-12-14**], [**2136-12-18**]: Sputum Cx: Klebsiella pneumonia
(extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer)
.
Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**2136-12-5**]): No evidence of acute pulmonary disease,
cardiomegaly with pacemaker.
.
2)LE Doppler ([**2136-12-5**]): No evidence of DVT
.
3)Cardiac catheterization ([**2136-12-7**]): 1.  Selective coronary
angiography in this right dominant system revealed severe three
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was totally occluded.
There was likely thrombus in the left main stent. The LAD was
totally occluded proximally.  The distal LAD had diffuse disease
and filled via the LIMA.  The LCx was totally occluded
proximally.  The second OM filled via a SVG and had 70% stenosis
distal to the vein graft touch down.  The RCA was not engaged as
it was known to be totally occluded. 2.  Arterial conduit
angiography revealed a patent LIMA to LAD.  The LIMA anastomosis
was in the mid to distal LAD.  The SVG to RCA was patent.  The
SVG to OM2 had 70% in stent restenosis.  The SVG to OM1 was not
engaged as it was known to be totally occluded. 3.  Left
ventriculography was not performed because the patient was
unstable.
4.  Resting hemodynamics elevated left and right sided filling
pressures.  The LVEDP was 18 (mean PCW 22) mmHg.  The RVEDP was
18 mmHg. Systemic arterial pressures were elevated with a
central aortic SBP of 140 and DBP of 56 mmHg (while on dopamine
infusion).  Cardiac index was perserved at 3.99 l/min/m2 (output
6.34 l/min). 5. An intra aortic ballon pump was placed. 6.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the LMCA with a 3.5 BMS post
dilated with a 4.0 NC balloon. Final angiography revealed a less
than 10%
residual stenosis with no angiographic evidence of dissection,
embolization or peforation. (See PTCA comments) 7. Limited low
inflation balloon angioplasty of in-stent segment of the LCx
with 20% residual stenosis. 8. Patent left subclavian stent.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the LMCA.
3. Balloon angioplasty of in-stent segment of LCx.
.
4)ECHO ([**2136-12-10**]):The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably low normal (LVEF 50-55%) with
basal anterior and antero-septal segmetns appearing hypokinetic
on some views (sub-optimal image quality). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
5)CT Head w/o contrast ([**2136-12-15**]): 1. No acute intracranial
hemorrhage. 2. Chronic left occipital/posterior parietal infarct
and diffuse chronic small vessel infarcts. No specific CT
evidence to suggest acute major vascular territorial infarction,
though if suspicion is high, MRI would be more sensitive to
assess.
.
6)ECHO ([**2136-12-17**]):The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%). No
regional dysfunction is identified. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened with relative immobility of the posterior leaflet
(?rheumatic origin). There is no mitral valve prolapse. At least
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2136-12-10**], regional left ventricular systolic
function is not s
