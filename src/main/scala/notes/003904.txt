80yoM with a history of DM, PVD, s/p mechanical AVR (19 years

initially presenting with a fever and s/p a fall.  The patient
was apparently in his USOH until two days prior to admission
when per his wife had chills.  He then got up to go to bed and
fell, unwitnessed, no LOC.  He got up and went to the kitchen
and his wife noticed he had an abrasion on his head, she said he
never lost consciousness and it seemed that he had tripped on
the stairs.  He was walking normally and had normal speech.  He
then went to sleep.  The next a.m. he awoke and continued to
have chills, he then went to the bathroom.  While on the toilet
he asked his wife for his jacket as he felt very cold.  When she
arrived with his jacket he had shaking chills and was conscious
and conversive.  Then he all of a sudden started staring
straight ahead and was no longer conversing and seemed to have
lost consciousness.  His wife called 911 and she returned to
find him still on the toilet but leaning on the wall.  He had no
abnormal movements while unconscious and no abnormal eye
movements.  Per wife his speech now seems the same as his speech
when he is not wearing his dentures.

body aches over the past 2 weeks.  No cough or rhinorrhea.  No
urinary symptoms.  No chest pain or shortness of breath per his

have a superficial abrasion on his R scalp and a negative Head
CT.  He was given IV labetalol and his BP then was 180/90.  He
was noted to be febrile to 102 F and blood cultures were drawn,
an LP was performed which was negative, and he was given 2g IV
ceftriaxone.  In addition he was noted to have "seizure like"
activities in the ER and was given IV ativan.

[**11-21**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]:
1. No acute infarction.
2. Patent major intracranial arteries, without flow limiting
stenosis,
occlusion or aneurysm more than 3 mm, within the resolution of
MR angiogram. Some stenosis of the left distal vertebral,
cavernous segments, and the middle cerebral artery on the right
are noted, as described above.

[**11-20**] CXR:
In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there are continued low
lung
volumes in this patient with intact sternal sutures. The
nasogastric tube has been removed.
Some increasing opacification is seen at the left base in the
retrocardiac
region. Although this could merely represent atelectasis, in
view of the
patient's fever of the possibility of supervening pneumonia
cannot be
excluded.

ECHO [**11-19**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present and appears well-seated. The aortic valve
prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No vegetation or
abscess seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
FEVER: Patient presenting with vague febrile illness and
fatigue.  Pulmonary infection seemed most likely, given some
evidence of progression of pulmonary infiltrates on CXR.
Presentation would also be consistent with viral infection,
although flu test negative.  Originally transferred for TEE but
this was negative for valvular pathology.  Blood cultures
negative.  Story not very concerning for seizure.  Since
admission was afebrile with no leukocytosis.  LP was negative.
ESR and CRP elevated suggesting some subacute organic illness.
UA suggested dehydration but no UTI.  He was started on empiric
Vancomycin for endocarditis on [**11-19**]. which was stopped.  He was
treated with a three day course of azithromycin of CAP.  He
improved with IV flui
