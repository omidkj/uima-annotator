Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 80 yo lady w/ h/o NHL dx'd [**2103**] tx w/ CHOP and rituximab,
remote breast ca, and recent RUL resection ([**8-5**]) for spiculated
lung mass (path c/w NHL recurrence), presents to ED w/ acute
worsening sob over last 24 hrs and subacute worsening over last
week. This is in the setting of stopping her daily lasix because
"I feel sick when I am on it."  There was some confusion on her
part about whether to take her potassium, lasix, or both, as she
was seen in ED last week for hypokalemia and has not been sure
what to take since that visit. At that time, she was given K
repletion and sent home. She has been taking lasix
intermittently since last week, last dose today. Patient denies
fevers/chills/malaise/abd complaints. She sleeps in seated
position secondary to "inner [**Last Name **] problem," but denies orthopnea.
She denies pedal edema or weight gain. Appetite has been good,
per her report. She was discharged with home oxygen in [**Month (only) 205**], but
has not been using it until this past week. Cannot quantify how
far she can walk w/o fatigue. Denies palpitations, chest
discomfort. Of note, patient notes hoarse voice since her
extubation from her RUL resection.
.
On presentation, T 95.9, BP 160/100; HR 100; sat 83% RA. NRB
placed with sats to 100%.  Foley inserted, Lasix 20 mg IV given

ceftriaxone 1 g IV and levoflox 500 mg IV x 1 for concern of
pna. Pulmonary consult obtained and patient admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
[**2110-10-19**]
BILATERAL DECUBITUS VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The pleural effusions
appear to be layering, with the right larger than left.
Underlying infiltrates, particularly in the right are also
possible. Followup is recommended.
.
[**2110-10-20**]
CHEST X-RAY AP PORTABLE VIEW.
COMPARISON: Decubitus film of [**2110-10-19**].
FINDINGS: There is a moderate-to-severe right-sided pleural
effusion and a small left pleural effusion. The heart size is
normal. There is no other interval change.
IMPRESSION: A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small
left pleural effusion
.
[**2110-10-21**]
Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**2110-10-20**].
FINDINGS: Heart is partially obscured, but unchanged and likely
of normal size. There are bilateral pleural effusions, large on
the right and moderate on the left, unchanged. No pneumothorax
identified. Bibasilar atelectasis persists.
IMPRESSION: No change from previous exam
.
[**2110-10-22**]
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**10-21**]:
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on the right and
moderate on the left, has increased in volume. There is new
atelectasis or conceivably consolidation in the lateral aspect
of the right mid lung, which should be reassessed following
decrease in pleural fluid. Mediastinum remains shifted slightly
to the right. Heart size is obscured by pleural effusion, but
has not changed in the interim. There is no pneumothorax.
.
[**2110-10-24**]
History of right upper lobectomy and shortness of breath.

There is loss of volume on the right with elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm and shift of heart and mediastinum to the right.
There are bilateral pleural effusions. The ill-defined right mid
zone opacity noted on the prior film of [**2110-10-22**], has
partially resolved. There is persistent ill-defined opacity at
the right lung base. In addition, there is ill-defined opacity
in the left lower zone that is either new or was partly hidden
by the left pleural effusion on the prior film. No definite
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar pulmonary
opacities consistent with atelectases/consolidation. No
pneumothorax. Partial resolution of the right mid zone opacity.
.
[**2110-10-25**]
LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS CHEST: A small pleural effusion is seen,
loculated, on the right. Right lateral decubitus films show no
evidence of nondependent air, i.e., no findings to suggest
pneumothorax. Otherwise, findings are not significantly changed
since the examination of 12:15 of the same day.
.
EKG: sinus vs sinus arrythmia, tachy, rate 104; nl axis; no LVH,
nl qwaves or ischemic changes
.
