Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 63 y/o F with history of hep C/ETOH cirrhosis with
multiple admissions for AMS who presents here with altered
mental status. At nursing home, she was found to have altered
mental status and was sent to an outside hospital where a UA was
positive, chest xray and head CT were negative. She was given 1
dose of levaquin at the outside hospital. She was transferred
here and her UA was positive and a CXR shows mild pulmonary
edema.

She has had several recent admissions for altered mental status.
Most recently [**Date range (1) 99384**] she was here with AMS and underwent
an infectious workup with negative results. CT of the head was
performed which was unremarkable. She underwent abdominal
ultrasound which did show patent TIPS. During hospital course,
she had no signs of active GI bleeding. Her hematocrit was
stable and she was not transfused. The patient was continued on
Lactulose and Rifaximin, as well as Zyprexa. She was also
admitted [**Date range (1) 99382**] for mental status
changes requiring intubation for airway protection. She was
treated for hepatic encephalopathy with increased lactulose
doses w/ improvement in her mental status.

In the ED, her vitals signs were Tm 100 BP 100/49 HR 79 sat97%
2LNC RR14. No ascites to tap for dxtic. She was given nalaxone,
as her tox screen was positive opiods and a mild improvement in
her mental status. UA was positive. Received a dose of
Vancomycin 1gm IV.

While in the MICU she was treated with Ciprofloxacin for urinary
tract infection, and lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
encephalopathy. She remained hemodynamically stable upon
transfer to the floor.

Radiology:
ECG ([**7-2**]):  Sinus tachycardia. Delayed R wave transition.
Compared to tracing #1 there is now an R wave in lead V2. This
may represent altered lead placement. Clinical correlation is
suggested

CXR ([**7-2**]):  Mild pulmonary edema, similar to that seen on
[**2168-6-1**].

CXR ([**7-4**]):  Mild worsening of pulmonary edema is seen, mainly
in the periphery of both lungs, left more than right.

U/S Abd/Pelvis ([**7-2**]):  Patent TIPS. Velocities appear
appropriate although accuracy is diminished due to patient
motion.  No evidence of ascites.  Gallbladder sludge and stones.
No ultrasonic evidence of cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 yo female with history of HepC/ETOH
cirrhosis, history of prior substance abuse, and recurrent
hepatic encephalopathy, who presents with altered mental status.

.
#. Altered Mental Status:  Patient was found by nursing home to
have altered mental status on [**2168-7-2**]. On admission to OSH,
patient's U/A had large blood, moderate leukocytes, and moderate
bacteria. Patient also had a toxicology screen which was
positive for opioids. Review of med list from extended care
facility does not reveal opiod use, it is not clear where or
when patient received narcotics prior to admission to [**Hospital1 18**]. At
OSH, the patient was given one dose of Levoquin and naloxone,
after which she had some improvement in her mental status.  On
admission to [**Hospital1 18**], patient received three doses of
Ciprofloxacin, was restarted on her home dose of lactulose and
rifaximin, and received IV hydration for treatment of acute
renal failure as the team thought her mental status change could
be related to dehydration, hepatic encephalopathy, or her UTI.
With above interventions the patient's mental status improved
and she is currently back to her baseline, oriented x 2, often
tangential in thought.
.
#. Acute Renal Failure:  Patient's Cr was elevated from baseline
of 1.2 to 2.4 on admission. The patient appeared hypovolemic and
received two boluses of IV fluids, as the team believed her ARF
was caused by dehydration in the setting of lactulose
administration, diuresis and poor PO intake. The patient's Cr
returned to her baseline of 1.1 with volume resuscitation and
holding diuretics. On discharge the patient's diuretics have
been held. Would recommend daily weights with the reinitiation
of Lasix 10 mg daily if the patient has a weight gain of [**2-14**]
pounds or clinical evidence of fluid overload.
.
#. Urinary Tract Infection: Patient was found to have a positive
urine analysis upon admission to the OSH.  She was given one
dose of Levoquin before transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  Upon admission at
[**Hospital1 18**], patient completed a course of 500 mg of Ciprofloxacin PO
q24h (i.e. 3 days) although of note her urine culture <10,000
bacteria.
.
#. Cirrhosis:  Patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis with
history of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy.  She is s/p TIPS
for GI bleeding and portal gastropathy.  Patient was continued
on her previous regimen of lactulose, rifaximin, and ursodiol.
Her LFTs remained stable throughout this admission and was
treated for encaphalopathy as above.

#. Iron deficiency anemia: On revi
