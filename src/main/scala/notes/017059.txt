Transesophageal echocardiogram.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 48828**] is a 61 yo man w/ h/o HTN, hypercholesterolemia who
presented to the ED w/ c/o cough, congestion, SOB.  Pt states
was in his USOH until approximately 1.5 weeks ago when developed
mild non-productive cough and mild DOE.  States was stable until
approximately 5 days ago when noted worsening DOE which
progressed over next couple days - noted on climbing stairs,
walking short distances.  Continue non-productive cough during
this time.  1 day prior to presentation, pt noted onset of
fevers to 101-102.  Called PCP who prescribed him azithromycin
and robitussion by phone w/ plans to see her in clinic next
week.  Pt took 1st dose of z-pack day prior to presentation.  Pt
then stated slept "ok" overnight, but upon awakening this
morning was in marked resp distress, walked to bathroom and was
"gasping" for breath, prompting ED visit.

ROS otherwise notable for some "chest tightness" over past
couple of days, which he describes as b/l, in back as well,
pleuritic, along w/ some pleuritic R chest pain.  Also has noted
some "wheezing" over past 1-2 days, most noticably o/n last
night.  On questioning +/- orthopnea (states gets SOB at night
while lying down and on occasion gets better w/ sitting up, but
sometimes does not), no PND, no ankle edema, no weight gain.
States takes anti-hypertensives as directed.  States has not
gotten flu shot this year.  Denies known sick contacts but
states works in retail so meets many people that might be sick.

In [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have O2 sat initially of 77% on RA, BP
210/220, HR 133, T 96.9.  Initial concern for hypertension
induced CHF (has h/o LVH, but no h/o CHF), and pt was placed on
CPAP and nitro gtt.  Labs notable for WBC 14, pro BNP 2054, and
trop leak of 0.18 (CK 245).  EKG with LVH but no ischemic
changes.  CXR demonstrated multi-lobar pna (large portion of R
lung, as well as LLL), ?cephalization of vessels.  Pt given
Vanc, CTX, azithro in ED.  Given trop leak, given asa 325mg PO x
1 and started on heparin gtt as well.  With above measures, pt's
respiratory status improved to be able to be weaned down to NRB.

Currently pt states that he feels much better than on initial
presentation to ED, still not 100% better.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia:
Initially presented with respiratory complaints, hypoxia, DOE,
also with cough and fevers.  This was felt to be due to both
pneumonia (as seen on CXR) as well as CHF.  For the pneumonia,
he was initially started on broad spectrum with Vancomycin,
ceftriazone and azithromycin; with was narrowed to azithromycin
alone to complete 10 day course.  DFA also checked which is
negative for flu.

2. Congestive heart failure, diastolic, acute:
Upon admission, patient described progressive DOE as primary
complaint, with improvement in resp status upon control of BP.
CHF felt to be due to both hypertensive emergency, as elevated
BP 210/110 on presentation, as well as mitral regurgitation.
Hypertension was treated with four medications:
- Amlodipine 5mg daily
- HCTZ 25mg daily
- Toprol XL 300mg daily
- Lisinopril 40mg daily

In addition to the above, it was noted that the patient consumes
up to [**8-30**] drinks/night on occasion; he was counseled at length
regarding abstinence, given the effects of alcohol on both blood
pressure and heart health overall.

3. Mitral regurgication:
New murmur noted on admission, with an echo demostrating new 3+
MR.  Etiology was unclear but included possible chordae tendinae
rupture vs endocarditis.  Bedside TEE attempted, but
unsuccessful due to avid gag reflex.  Plan was for afterload
reduction with ACEI, as above.

4. NSTEMI:
Noted to have elevated trop to 0.18, CK 245 in setting of
respiratory distress, PNA and hypertension, as above.  Initially
started on heparin gtt in ED, though this was felt to be
secondary to demand (in setting of hypertension/resp distress)
as opposed to ACS.  He was continued on a statin, aspirin, ACEI,
beta-blocker.  He would likely benefit from an outpatient stress
test.

5. Alcohol:
On admission, patient reported drinking 1 beer/night.  However,
after discussion w/ pt's wife, states can drink up to [**8-30**]
drinks/night (including beer and hard alcohol).  He was
monitored for withdrawal (none noted) and counseled on
abstinence.

6. Hypercholesterolemia:  Continued simvistatin.
