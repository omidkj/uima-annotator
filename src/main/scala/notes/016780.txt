Pertinent Results:
Admission CT Head:
1. Bilateral temporal and left frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhagic
contusions with right temporoparietal subarachnoid hemorrhage
identified.
2. Predominantly left-sided facial fractures as described with a
superior
orbital wall fracture associated with a small extra-conal
hematoma noted in
the superior aspect of the left orbit.
3. No intracranial aneurysm identified.

Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Carotid Duplex:
Mild calcified plaque at the origins of both the left and right
internal
carotid arteries with less than 40% stenosis bilaterally.

CBC at Discharge [**11-8**]: WBC 9.8, HCT 30.8, Platelet count 332

MB, CK [**11-4**]: 6 and 0.73, down from a peak of 44 and 0.82 [**10-30**]

Lower extremity Duplex: No evidence of lower extremity DVT in
either leg.






Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to surgical trauma service with the above
described intraparenchymal hemorrhages and SAH.  Patient also
developed a NSTEMI that was followed with serial enzymes.  By
system his issues occurred and were managed by system.

Neurologic:  Patient arrived intubated due to his mental status
being [**3-3**] on arrival to the other hospital.  He then had a
frontal bolt placed here with ICP's measured.  The bolt was
removed and the patient then had an MRI that showed likely
diffuse axonal injury.  He was maintained on dilantin for a one
week course.  He then was following some commands at the time of
discharge and was noted to have 4 out of 5 strength in the RUE,
RLE, but a fairly significant L. sided hemiparesis.

Cardiac:  He had EKG changes and enzyme elevations that were
consistent with a NSTEMI and was unable to be anticoagulated due
to his head bleed.  The goal then was rate control with beta
blockade.  Cardiology followed the patient and we were able to
add aspirin one week into his hospital stay, along with lipitor,
and his home dose of lisinopril.  His TTE is described above in
the results section along with his cardiac enzyme levels.

Respiratory:  Patient was trached one week into his stay and was
noted to have thick secretions with 4+ gram negative diplococci,
2+ gram negative rods, 1+ gram positive rods noted on a BAL.  he
was treated broadly with vanco, zosyn, and cipro until the
culture came back citrobacter and the regimen was tapered to
cipro at the time of discharge.

GI:  Tubefeeds started early and patient received PEG at the
time of tracheostomy.  Tolerating tubefeeds, having BM's.

GU: Also with UTI with enterobacter and citrobacter sensitive to
cipro.  Sent on cipro.

Heme: Heparin SC approved by neurosurgery and started.  Patient
also received IVC filter at time of trach and PEG.

Endocrine:  Discharged on a sliding scale with BS controlled
between 98-137 last five days of stay on stable tubefeeding
regimen.

ID: To complete a 10 day course of cipro for PNA and UTI.
