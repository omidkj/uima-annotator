Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ibuprofen / Penicillins / Shellfish

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVVH

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with end-stage renal disease on HD, CHF (EF 40%), CAD
and hypothyroidism who presents with fluid overload, EKG changes
and cardiac enzyme elevations concerning for ischemia
transferred to the ICU for urgent dialysis.
.
By report of the patient, his sons and on review of his medical
records, the patient had progressive shortness of breath for
many months. This became abruptly worse approximately 24 hours
prior to admission. The patient had profound orthopnea and was
forced to sit on the edge of his bed with rapid breathing. His
sons asked the patient to go to the hospital but he refused. His
shortness of breath symptoms worsened and by morning the patient
agreed to come to the hospital. He denies at any point
developing chest pain. He notes baseline nausea unchanged and
worsening dyspnea on exertion at 12 steps and 2 pillow
orthopnea. He describes unchanged peripheral edema and denies
weight gain.
.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 1196**]
where he was felt to be volume overloaded with possible anterior
ST elevation on EKG and positive cardiac enzymes. He received
aspirin 81mg x 4, clopidogrel 600mg, lasix 100mg IV, nitropaste
1 inch subsequently changed to a nitroglycerin drip and then
discontinued and a heparin gtt. On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] floor
the patient was hemodynamically stable but in persistent
respiratory distress, tachypneic to 24-30 saturating well on 3L
oxygen by NC. He was evaluated by the renal consult service who
recommended transfer to the ICU for semi-urgent CVVHD for fluid
removal.
.
Of note, the patient was has difficulty with fluid removal at HD
due to hypotension. As a result he had chronic accumulation of
fluid. In addition, his outpatient cardiologist was not able to
institute a comprehensive cardiac regimen (including
beta-blocker).
.
Review of systems: Denies fevers, cough, weight loss,
nightsweats, melena, hematochezia, rash, arthralgias, myalgias,
claudication

CXR [**3-26**]:
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
sitting semi-erect position. Bilateral pleural effusions
obliterate the diaphragmatic contours and obscure the lower
portions of the heart silhouette. Significant cardiac
enlargement is most likely present. One can identify a
semi-circular calcification within the heart shadow indicative
of mitral ring calcium deposits. The thoracic aorta shows
extensive wall calcifications in the area of the arch, but the
aorta is not significantly widened. The pulmonary vasculature
demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern and there is
perivascular haze on the bases consistent with marked
congestion. Evidence of discrete local parenchymal infiltrates
cannot be identified; however, the possibility of infectious
processes in the bases concealed by the congestive pattern and
the pleural effusions is possible. The presence of a left
internal jugular approach double lumen catheter is recognized
seen to terminate in the lower SVC just at the junction with the
right atrium. In the right apical area, the metallic structures
of a stent, presumably in the right subclavian vein are
identified. There is no pneumothorax.

Comparison is made with the next previous available chest
examination of [**2176-4-12**]. Cardiac enlargement and pulmonary
congestive pattern with pleural effusions existed already at
that time, but these findings have moderately increased. The
wide caliber tube on the left side (probably dialysis line) did
not exist at that time.

IMPRESSION: Progression of left-sided CHF with bilateral pleural
effusions in elderly gentleman. No new pneumonia identified
which however, cannot be completely excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for urgent CVVH given his obvious
clinical volume overload causing dyspnea and relative hypoxia.
Previously, the dialysis team had been unable to remove enough
fluid intermittently without causing significant hypotension.
The patient was begun on CVVH by the renal team with an emergent
need for levophed to be run concurently through his return
dialysis line to support his blood pressure, even during a more
gentle CVVH. In addition, he had cardiac enzyme elevations and a
newly dropped EF from 40% to 20% on this admission, likely
secondary to demand ischemia due to his volume overload. He was
initially begun on integrillin and a heparin drip to treat
possible occlusive thrombotic heart disease. His oxygenation
improved but he was unable to be weened from his vasopressor
medications while on CVVH. In discussion with the patient and
his family, it was made clear that the patient wanted to return
to his previous quality of life, only requiring intermittent HD.
However, it was also clear that it was very unlikely he would be
able to return to this state. In discussion with the patient and
his family, it was decided to make the patient comfort measures
only. All non-comfort medications were stopped including CVVH
and levophed and the patient was made comfortable using
intermittent morphine by IV. The patient expired peacefully
surrounded by family approximately 24 hours after
discontinuation of pressors and CVVH.
