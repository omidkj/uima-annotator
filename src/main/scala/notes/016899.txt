HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
female with a history of CAD, hepatocellular carcinoma,
hepatitis C virus, gastric varices, who originally presented
to an outside hospital on [**2150-4-12**] with hematemesis and a
low hematocrit.  Endoscopy at that time revealed 2 to 3 plus
esophageal varices and portal gastropathy, but no active
bleeding.  The patient had a slow hematocrit drop over the
next week requiring frequent blood transfusions.  She was
treated with an octreotide drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible [**Last Name (un) **].  She was initially admitted to the medical
intensive care unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed in
[**6-15**] by biopsy, hepatitis C virus, cirrhosis, esophageal
varices, hemorrhoids/rectal varices, portal hypertension,
hypertension, diastolic CHF, CAD, status post MI times 2,
diverticulosis, colonic angiodysplasia, chronic renal
insufficiency, arthritis, gout, hyperlipidemia, status post
cholecystectomy, status post melanoma resection [**2140**].

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, captopril, Lipitor,
Protonix, Lasix 40 mg a day, nifedipine, and Darvocet.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Include propranolol 20 mg b.i.d.,
captopril 75 mg t.i.d., nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d., Imdur 30 mg
q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Exam on admission, temperature 93
degrees, pulse 60, blood pressure 136/42, respiratory rate
22, saturating 99 percent on room air.  The patient was
pleasant in no acute distress.  Awake, alert, oriented times
3.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Pale
conjunctivae.  Extraocular motions were intact.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Heart has a regular rate and rhythm with a wide
systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  Chest showed
minimal crackles at the left base.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No
organomegaly.  Extremities:  There were positive pulses, no
edema.  Triple lumen was in the right fem.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission:  White count 5.5,
hematocrit 33, platelets 123, BUN 29, creatinine 0.9.  EGD
from [**2150-6-13**], 2 to 3 plus esophageal varices, no stigmata of
a recent bleed, blood in the stomach, portal gastropathy.
MRI of the abdomen [**2150-3-25**], cirrhotic liver 4.2 times 4.  No
mass in the liver, increase in size from the prior.  No
ascites.  Portal vein patent with hepatopetal flow.  Spleen
was normal size with a 7 cm mass in the upper pole, not
changed from prior.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upper GI bleed:  The patient initially
admitted to the MICU.  She was hemodynamically stable
throughout her stay.  She underwent right upper quadrant
ultrasound to evaluate the portal vasculature, which showed a
patent portal vein.  She was followed with serial hematocrits
and underwent an endoscopy.  Endoscopy revealed portal
hypertensive gastropathy, grade 2 esophageal varices, but no
active bleeding.  She was continued on an octreotide drip for
24 to 48 hours further and it was felt that she was not a
candidate for TIPS at this time.  She was treated with beta-
blockers and nitrates to reduce portal hypertension and had
no further active bleeding throughout her stay.  She was
scheduled for followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7033**] in the Liver Clinic
upon discharge.


Hepatocellular carcinoma:  Her primary oncologist is Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 150**] and prior to her admission was being assessed for
the possibility of surgery versus chemoembolization versus
radiofrequency ablation of her HCC.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 150**] was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and saw the patient while in house.  She felt that
although her hepatoma had slightly increased in size, she
felt it was asymptomatic and her variceal bleeding secondary
to portal hypertension, cirrhosis, as well as a history of
coronary artery disease and flash pulmonary edema were much
more significant medical problems that were negatively
impacting her health and that these would greatly increased
the likelihood of complications if any tumor-directed therapy
was attempted.  It was felt that if she was stable for few
weeks, then a consideration of radiofrequency ablation would
be made.  She was set up for an outpatient followup.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged home in a stable
condition with no further GI bleed and stable hematocrit
without any further need for transfusions.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Include variceal/portal hypertension,
hypertensive bleed, hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis,
diastolic congestive heart failure, and hypertension.  She
was asked to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7033**] at the Liver
Center, as well as Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 150**], her primary
oncologist.  Her major surgical procedure is an endoscopy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include propranolol 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d., nifedipine 20 mg p.o. q.8h., lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., sucralfate 1 g p.o. q.i.d.,
isosorbide mononitrate sustained release 60 mg q.d., Lasix 40
mg q.d., and Protonix 40 mg q.12h.
