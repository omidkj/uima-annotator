FINAL REPORT


HISTORY: Status post aortic valve replacement.

COMPARISON: [**5-11**] /06.

CHEST: AP portable view. The endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz
catheter, feeding
tube, chest tubes and drains have been removed. There is a very
small right
apical pneumothorax. There is new atelectasis at the right lung
base.
Increased opacity at the left lung base likely represents a
combination of
atelectasis and pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary edema.
Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Very small right apical pneumothorax.
2. New right lower lobe atelectasis. Worsening left lower lobe
atelectasis/left pleural effusion.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

PROCEDURE DATE: [**2196-5-10**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Aortic stenosis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery
disease.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
3. Severe RV and LV diastolic dysfunction.
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated no
angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease
in this
right dominant circulation. The LMCA had no angiographically
apparent
flow limiting disease. The LAD and its diagonal branch had no
flow
limiting disease. The LCX and the OM branches had no flow
limiting
disease. The RCA was a dominant vessel without flow limiting
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with RVEDP=27 mmHg, LVEDP=33mmHg and mean
PCWP=33mmHg.
Cardiac output and index were 4.3 L/min and 2.0 L/min/m2
respectively.
The peak gradient across the aortic valve was 120 mmHg. The mean
gradient was 88 mmHg with calculated [**Location (un) 109**]=0.4 cm2.
3. No left ventriculogram performed due to elevated filling
pressures.
TECHNICAL FACTORS:
Total time (Lidocaine to test complete) = 42 minutes.

Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
globally.. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending
[**Location (un) 5236**] is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic [**Location (un) 5236**] is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
[**Location (un) 5236**]. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: Improved LV systolic fxn. EF=50-55%. Good RV systolic
fxn. Well-seated and functioning aortic valve prosthesis. No
leak, no AI. Trace - 1+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5235**]. Other parameters as
pre-bypass.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**5-10**] and underwent cath with results noted below.
AVR/Maze performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-11**] and transferred to the
CSRU in [**Last Name (un) 2677**] condition on neosynephrine, propofol, insulin ad
epinephrine drips. EP service consulted for continuing AFib and
amiodarone started. Extubated on POD #1 and transferred to the
floor to begin increasing his activity level. Chest tubes
removed on POD #2 and gentle diuresis continued with beta
blockade also started. Pacing wires removed on POD #4 and
coumadin started. Hct 23 and INR 1.5 on discharge on POD #5. Pt
to be seen in wound clinic in 2 weeks and follow up as per
discharge instructions. Coumadin dosing/INR to be followed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23873**] with first blood draw on [**5-18**].
