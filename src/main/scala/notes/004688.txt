History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 53 year old man with achondroplasia, morbid
obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome c/b pulmonary
hypertension and right heart failure, diabetes mellitus and
hypertension, with a recent admission for PNA/UTI in Jaunary who
presents with fevers, cough, low sats. He also endorsed some
pain with urination.

He noted at home that he was febrile to 103. A CXR done at
[**Hospital3 **] reportedly showed a R sided PNA. He was given
Alubterol, IVF, and Levaquin, and transferred here.

He states that he has felt relatively unwell for the past [**3-8**]
days, however felt much worse this morning with increased cough,
shortness of breath, chills. Patient has had multiple
pneumonia's in the past and is a very difficult intubation
secondary to achondroplasia (usually nasal intubation).

In the ED, initial VS were 101.1 134 129/73 28 95% 5L. Labs were
ntoable for a lactate of 1.1, WBC of 13.3 and a HCT of 35.0. UA
w/ few bacteria but only 2 WBC, neg LE, and neg nitrites. He
received ibuprofen, 1 g Vancomycin, and clindamycin downstairs.
he had a R femoral groin line placed for access. He got 1 liter
of fluid, and a foley catheter. On transfer, he was 133 23 94%
on 3 L 114/48. Not ambulatory at baseline.
.
On arrival to the MICU, mental status was depressed and blood
pressures were decreased, but corrected w/ appropriate cuff
placement and recheck.

IMAGING:
.
[**3-28**] LENIs:
IMPRESSION: Normal wall-to-wall color flow and augmentation of
the examined left lower extremity veins. Compression could not
be assessed due to patient body habitus and intolerance. No
definite evidence of deep venous thrombosis on this extremely
limited exam.

[**3-28**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Dense atelectasis of the left lung base, less likely
pneumonia.

[**3-29**] CXR:
Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates normal lung
volumes.
There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Hilar and
mediastinal
silhouettes are unchanged. Heart size is normal. Left
costophrenic angle is
not fully imaged; however, pleural density involving the left
lateral
hemithorax in the lower lobe is longstanding and likely
represents pleural
thickening and/or effusion.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of pneumonia. Left lower lobe pleural density likely
represents
thickened pleura and/or effusion.

[**3-31**] LLE US:
FINDINGS: Superficial ultrasound of the left lower extremity was
performed
using a linear array transducer. Three separate areas were
scanned including the left calf posteriorly, anterior to the
shin, and the upper inner thigh on the left. There is
subcutaneous edema identified in these regions, but no drainable
collection seen.
IMPRESSION: Subcutaneous edema, without visualized abscess
formation or
drainable collection.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old male with PMH of achondroplasia, morbid obesity,
obesity hypoventilation syndrome c/b pulmonary hypertension and
right sided congestive heart failure presenting with sepsis,
including fevers, hypoxia/elevated respiratory rate, and
elevated WBC count requiring ICU level care.  This was
accountable to primarily leg cellulitis, as well as likely
pneumonia.

ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Leg cellulitis:  noted to have increase erythema, warmth, and
swelling of left lower extremity suspicious for
cellulitis/erysipelas.  Given the clinical severity, surgery was
called for concern of necrotizing fascitis and clindamycin was
added.  Surgery felt his exam was not consistent with
necrotizing fasciitis.  LENIs were negative for DVT or any
drainable collection.  ID was consulted and felt his symptoms to
be most consistent with cellulitis.  Slowly, the infection
regressed on vancomycin and clindamycin. He was discharged on a
regimen of linezolid 800mg [**Hospital1 **] to be continued for another 8
days for a 14 day course.

# Respiratory distress/Pneumonia: Has history of recurrent
pneumonia with CXR at [**Hospital1 **] reportedly consistent with R-sided
infiltrate prior to transfer here.  Given tenous clinical status
on presentation, he was initially admitted to the MICU and
treated empirically for HCAP. On transfer to the unit, he was
tachycardic, sat 94% on 3 L, but he was very somnolent. ABGs
showed CO2 retention and the patient was placed on BiPAP. While
in the ICU, h
