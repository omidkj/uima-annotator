Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23**] is an 84 year-old female with a history of afib, CHF
who presents with progressively worsening shortness of breath.
.
Recently ([**2132-7-21**]) had an appointment in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic. At that
time, she was euvolemic on exam and thought to be doing quite
well. Since that time, she has felt quite fatigued, although she
is still able to walk many blocks without SOB.
.
This morning, at four AM, she awoke feeling SOB. She did not
awake gasping, but did have a hard time catching her breath. She
tried walking and washing her face. Neither was effective so she
called EMS to bring her to the ED for futher evaluation.
.
In the ED, vitals showed T 97.7, BP 149/87, HR 85, 83% on RA.
Blood pressure increased to 177/90. Exam showed scant bibasilar
crackles, 1+ bipedal pitting edema.
.
She recieved aspirin, SL nitro followed by a nitro gtt. Heparin
was started for empiric coverage of a possible PE. Levaquin
given for for respiratory distress and leukocytosis though the
CXR showed no obvious PNA.
.
After she was given 40mg IV lasix, her SBPs fell to the 80s;
this was followed by a 500cc bolus of NS. Overall, she put out
~2000cc of urine.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 112/62 mm Hg while lying in bed. Pulse was 62
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 23 breaths/min and
she was satting 100% on 2 liters NC. Generally the patient was
well developed, well nourished and well groomed. The patient was
oriented to person, place and time. The patient's mood and
affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP about 4cm above the clavicle at 45 degrees. The carotid
waveform was normal. There was no thyromegaly. The were no chest
wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. The respirations were
not labored and there were no use of accessory muscles. The
lungs showed crackles half way up bilaterally.
.
Heart exam revealed no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The
heart sounds revealed a normal S1 and the S2 was normal with a
III/VI at the aortic site and a softer systolic murmur at the
apex.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had showed [**12-11**]+ edema with
significant varicosities. There were no abdominal, femoral or
carotid bruits.

ECHO [**2132-7-28**]

IMPRESSION: Mild aortic stenosis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Preserved  regional and global biventricular sytolic function.
Mild pulmonary  hypertension. Biatrial enlargement.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-7-6**],
the severity of  aortic stenosis is slightly increased.
Estimated pulmonary artery pressures  are slightly higher.

[**2132-7-27**]

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: Comparison was made with the prior
head CT dated [**2130-9-27**]. There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage. There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline
structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiations are preserved, and
ventricles are unremarkable and are unchanged. The surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the ED with acute pulmonary edema due
to CHF exacerbation. She was admitted to the CCU for intensive
monitoring due to the fact that she became somewhat hypotensive
after diuresis of about 2-3 Liters on 40 mg IV lasix. The nitro
drip and the heparin were discontinued. Cardiac enzymes were not
consistent with an acute coronary syndrome. Her CXR was
significant for enalrged cardiac silhouette and pulmonary edema.
Upon transfer to the CCU, her breathing was no longer labored on
2 L n/c, and she was normotensive. She continued to diurese
overnight with no events. On hospital day 2, her lung exam was
significantly improved, although she had persistent JVD, edema,
and wet lungs. She was transferred to the floor and was
comfortable on room air. She received further lasix and she
diuresed briskly a around 2.5 Liters over the remaining two
days. Immediately after receiving the 40 mg IV lasix, her
diuresis was again too brisk and she felt weak and weas
orthostatic. Thus, a dose of 40 mg Lasix PO daily is judged to
be more adequate for this patient. She is discharged to
rehabilitation where her BP will be monitored in response to
this lasix dose, and where final adjustments can be made.

  Echo was consistent with diastolic heart failure and mitral
valve regurgitation (see report).

  She is on amiodarone and coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation. She
remained in sinus throughout this hospitalization, with heart
rates ranging between 50-60 beats per minute. Coumadin was held
for INR>3. On the day of her discharge, her INR is 3. Her dose
of coumadin and her INR will have to be monitored closely for
possible further adjustment.

   The patient complained of abdominal distention, but no pain,
at times. She was noted to be somewhat constipated. She was due
for a pelvic ultrasound on [**7-29**] as an outpatient. At her
request, this was cancelled and the test rescheduled for
[**8-12**]. She has been encouraged to undergo this test in
order to explore further causes of abdominal distention such as
an ovarian process.

   Because of her supratherapeutic INR and the fact that she had
a headache on presentation, she underwent CT of the head without
contrast, which was normal.

   She continued taking her Hydroxyurea for her history of
Polycythemia. She had a bout of pruritus which was treated with
sarna lotion. CBCs were frequently checked. She needs to follow
up with her hematologist.
