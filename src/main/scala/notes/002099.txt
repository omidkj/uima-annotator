Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9006**] is a 79yo Cantonese man (nonverbal at baseline) with
h/o severe dementia, several aspiration pnas, frequent UTIs who
was recently discharged from our hospital in [**Month (only) 359**] during
which time he was treated for Cdiff, UTI with yeast, and
aspiration pna with Zosyn. He presents today from his nursing
home with shortness of breath and dark urine. According to the
patient's grandson, who saw him yesterday, he looks much worse
today than he did at that time. He just finished treatment for
Cdiff with flagyl and po vanco, which was just stopped and by
report diarrhea worsened after discontinuing. It is also unclear
by his records whether he remains on or has just stopped zosyn
and vanco iv for aspiration pna. Culture data in our computer is
unrevealing except for urine repeatedly positive for yeast.
.
On arrival to our ER he was found to have new hypernatremia to
159 and to be tachycardic between 114-150 (last d/c summary
shows pt was tachycardic from 90s-110s throughout entire last
admission). He had O2 sat 81% on RA and required nonrebreather
mask in the ER for O2 sat 100%. His white count was 20, which is
stable from his last admission. He was given vancomycin 1g iv,
levofloxacin 500mg and flagyl 500mg. He was started on D5 1/2NS
at 150cc/hr. Blood and urine cultures were sent.
.
After a long discussion with his family (by the ER resident, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) they decided to continue his DNR/DNI status but
otherwise want him treated as needed. They will revisit this
after seeing if he stabilizes in a few days (versus possible
change to CMO). He was admitted to the ICU for increased nursing
needs.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2151-11-13**] 7:13 PM
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: Tip of a right PICC terminates in the distal
SVC. Heart, mediastinal structures are unremarkable and stable.
Nodular density previously noted in the right mid lung not well
appreciated. Basilar consolidations, right greater than left,
improved in comparison to the prior study. There is persistent
prominence of the pulmonary central vasculature representing
volume overload. No pneumothorax is identified.
Improving bibasilar consolidations. Mild pulmonary interstitial
edema.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2151-11-14**] 5:49 AM
There has been improvement in the right-sided aspiration
pneumonia. Changes in the left chest remain unaltered.
IMPRESSION: Some improvement in right lower lobe pneumonia.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2151-11-17**] 12:32 AM
Bilateral pulmonary opacities markedly asymmetric with left
predominance could represent either widespread pneumonia or
asymmetric pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is needed.
.
CHEST XR: [**2151-11-23**]
There are bilateral effusions with a left lower lobe opacity,
which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia. There are also
similar bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities, which are
predominantly basilar. There is no cardiac enlargement or upper
zone redistribution of the pulmonary vessels. There is also a
more nodular density seen in the left upper lung zone as well,
perhaps an early consolidation
.
CHEST CT: [**2151-11-24**]
Bilateral smoothly layering fluid density pleural effusions,
without evidence of loculation, but with compressive
atelectasis.
2. Centrilobular emphysema.
3. Low-density lesion within the liver dome, likely represents a
simple cyst. A left well-characterized lesion in the pancreatic
head is also seen. MRI or multiphasic CT is recommended for
further evaluation if indicated
.
EKG: [**11-24**]
Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to
the previous tracing lateral T wave inversion is new
