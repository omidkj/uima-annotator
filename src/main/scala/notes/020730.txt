Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 29767**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VATS

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 year old female with cerebral palsy, HTN,
hypothyroid, PAF, osteoporosis here s/p mech fall on R side 3
weeks ago (no head or neck trauma) who presents with 3 days of
nonproductive cough, low grade fever, leukocytosis and a CXR
that shows new R pleural effusion concerning for hemothorax
versus paraneumonic effusion. The patient states she slipped on
water 3 weeks ago, landing on ankle. Had significant swelling in
right LE and yesterday had a film that showed no fracture.
However, had also developed right sided flank/rib pain
approximately 3 days ago. Patient believes this may have been
related to twisting while getting out of bed and currently is
only present on movement. A rib film to evaluate this
demonstrated a right sided pleural effusion with question of
loculation. Patient came to the ED to be further evaluated.
.
Presented to the ED today and was found on repeat CXR to have
continued loculated pleural effusion. CT without contrast was
done to see if able to delineate between paraneumonic vs.
hemothorax, but still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] denies any SOB, DOE,
chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness. States cough present for
one week, nonproductive. No fevers, chills, night sweats, but
+fatigue. Labs demonstrated elevated WBC. Was given ceftriaxone
and azithromycin in ED and blood cultures sent. Currently she
states that she feels better than when she first presented to
the ED.
.
ROS significant for constipation, last BM on Monday, as well as
mild nausea, no vomiting. O/W negative for HA, URI sxs, chest
pain, orthopnea, PND, palpatations, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hesitancy.

Pertinent Results:
Right ankle films [**2108-5-22**]:
HISTORY: Right ankle pain.
Four radiographs of the right ankle demonstrate normal
mineralization. No fracture. The mortise is congruent. Talar
dome maintains a normal contour. Phleboliths are noted within
the regional soft tissues. The subtalar joint is normal.
IMPRESSION:
Unremarkable radiographs of the right ankle.
.
CXR [**2108-5-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of rib fracture or pneumothorax.
2. New moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion with evidence
of
loculation. Right basilar airspace opacities likely representing
atelectasis
.
CXR [**2108-5-23**]:
There is a persistent moderate-to-large multiloculated right
pleural effusion, without change since the recent radiograph of
[**2108-5-22**], but new compared to [**2107-10-14**] radiograph.
Parenchymal opacities in the right middle and lower lobes
adjacent to the effusion may relate to areas of atelectasis or
contusion. There is no left pleural effusion. The heart is upper
limits of normal in size. The aorta is tortuous, and the
pulmonary vascularity is normal. Upon comparison to the
[**2107-10-14**] radiograph, apparent elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm is thought to be due to a subpulmonic component of
the pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No short interval change in moderate-to-large
loculated right pleural effusion. Considering history of recent
trauma, this raises a concern for hemothorax. Adjacent
parenchymal opacities in the right middle lobe may relate to
atelectasis or contusion.
.
[**2108-5-23**] CT chest w/o contrast:
Moderate to large left effusion with loculation. Measures low
attenuation fluid density. Consolidation with air bronchograms
in right lung also, likely pneumonia versus contusion.
.
Abd KUB [**2108-5-23**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intestinal obstruction. No hernia is
identified
on this single AP projection. A lateral radiograph would be
useful to assess
for presence of abdominal wall hernia.
.
EKG: NSR, RAD, IVCD, no ST changes, intervals normal (of note,
on prior EKG there was LAD present)

[**2108-6-1**] CXR
INDICATION: 80-year-old woman status post VATS, decortication
for loculated pleural effusion, chest tubes removed. Assess
effusion, loculation.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Comparison is made to a prior study of
[**2108-5-30**].

The heart size is in the upper limits of normal. The mediastinal
and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature
is normal. There is some scarring in the left lower lobe and a
loculated right pleural effusion is again noted. This is
unchanged in comparison to the prior study.

IMPRESSION: No change in the loculated right pleural effusion.
.
[**2108-5-30**] Video Oropharyngeal Swallow
FINDINGS: Fluoroscopic guidance was provided to the speech and
swallowing pathologist. Barium of various consistencies was
administered. Premature spillover was identified. There was
moderate-to-severe residue, in the valleculae more than the
piriform sinuses. The right side was more severely affected than
the left. Penetration was identified both with nectar-thickened
as well as with thin liquids. When the patient swallowed thin
liquids, followed by pudding, there was a moderate amount of
aspiration identified due to residue in the piriform sinus. This
was subsequently followed by an ineffective cued cough.

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate aspiration after the swallowing of thin liquids,
followed by pudding.
2. Penetration with both thin and nectar-thickened liquids.
3. Moderate-to-severe residue in the valleculae and piriform
sinuses as well as premature spillover
.
[**2108-5-31**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
EMG [**2108-6-1**]
IMPRESSION:

Essentially normal study. The electrophysiologic findings do not
support a
pre- or postsynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission. The
findings do
not support a generalized myopathy or generalized disorder of
motor
