Findings
Left pleural effusion
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2174-2-11**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Small LV cavity. Normal
regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No
resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). MVR
well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Mild PA systolic
hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: Large pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. Stranding is visualized within the pericardial
space c/w organization. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No RV diastolic collapse.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. with borderline normal free wall
function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a large
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
Stranding is visualized within the pericardial space c/w
organization. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen,
however there are indirect signs of elevated intrapericardial
pressure (RV free wall diastolic flattening)

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-2-11**],
the large pericardial effuison is new.

IMPRESSION: Large circumfirential pericardial effusion with
early organization. No overt tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to intially to the cardiac surgical floor  then
had an ECHO which revealed pericardial effusion and was
transferred to the cardiac ICU to monitor for tamponade. Of
note, Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 77017**] was c-diff positive at rehab abd was being
treated with flagyl. Her urine was also positive for gram neg
rods and was treated with cipro. Ms. [**First Name (Titles) 77017**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] aggressive
diuresis. On HD #2 Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the OR with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] for pericardial window for drainage of pericardial
effusion and bilat pleural effsuions (left 1 liter and right
500cc). She was treated with periop vanco. She was readmitted to
the ICU post operatively intubated and on neosynephrine. She
weaned from the vent and pressors and was extubated. She was
seen by electrophysiology and her dofetilide was maintained and
VERY LOW DOSE COUMADIN was recommended when stable. She was
transferred from the ICU to the floor. Bilateral chest tubes
remained in place to suction for drainge. when chest tubes were
placed to water seal, she developed pneumothoracies and was
placed back to suction. Chest tubes were later removed and Ms.
[**Name14 (STitle) 77018**] CXR showed stable bilateral 20% pneumothoracies. She
was evaluated by physical therapy and reab was recommended.
On POD#8 she was discharged to rehab.
SHE WILL NEED HER INR CHECKED DAILY AND RECIEVE ONLY LOW DOSE
COUMADIN- 1MG DAILY. SHE WILL ALSO NEED HER RENAL AND LIVER
FUNCTION MONITORED CLOSELY WHILE ON DOFETILIDE. SHE WILL HAVE
CLOSE FOLLOW UP WITH DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]- APPOINTMENT IS SC
