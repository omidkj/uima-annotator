Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F from NH with coffee-ground emesis Hct of 15, also with
hypotension.
.
HEMATEMESIS/HYPOTENSION - pt had significant hematemesis and
melena suggestive of UGIB. In the ED she received 3U of PRBC's
and continued to be hemodynamically unstable. She continued a
PPI drip, and discussion with the family was held about
intubation for EGD which family agreed to in order to control
the patient's bleeding.

    She was intubated and started on peripheral Levophed for
hypotension noted after the intubation. On EGD there was a
tremendous amount of fresh and clotted blood in the esophagus.
After suctioning the patient was noted to have a large 3-4cm
ulcer in the duodenum, with a dominant protruding vessel which
was was clipped, and BiCAP was applied to the base of the
vessel.

    She continued to be hypotensive and received a total of 8U
of PRBCs and 4L of IVF's. While intubated and on peripheral
Levophed she was noted to be pulseless at 8:30pm with a
wide-complex rythm at 40bpm c/w a PEA arrest. After discussion
with the family it was decided that no further measures should
be taken, and the patient was extubated without spontaneous
respirations or pulse. She was pronounced dead at 8:30pm, with
immediate cause of death to be blood loss. Primary cause of
death was upper GI bleed, and antecedent cause of death being
gastric ulcer. The family and the medical examiner declined an
autopsy. The covering attending Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 496**] was notified, as
well as the physican covering [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
