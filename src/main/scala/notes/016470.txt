HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2110-11-20**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for a coronary artery
bypass graft times one.  The patient initially had a LMA to
left anterior descending with a revision and saphenous vein
graft to left anterior descending. Please see operative note
for further details.  The patient was transported to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on epinephrine,
Neo-Synephrine and Propofol infusion.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was weaned off
the epinephrine infusion with good cardiac indices.  The
patient awoke and followed commands with a stable neurologic
examination.  The patient was weaned off the ventilator and
when the patient was ready to extubate, the team determined
that the patient did not have an adequate cuff leak around
the endotracheal tube. It was decided that the patient would
get four doses of Decadron prior to extubation.

On postoperative day number two, the patient continued to
have no cuff leak.  The patient's creatinine, baseline of
1.5, had risen to 1.9 with continued good hemodynamics.  The
patient was started on Lasix for diuresis.  The patient
remained on minimal ventilatory support.

On postoperative day number three, the patient had an episode
of rapid atrial fibrillation and was treated with Amiodarone
and Lopressor.  The patient subsequently converted to sinus
rhythm. The patient continued to have inadequate cuff leak
for extubation in spite of good oxygenation and ventilation.
The patient's creatinine began to trend down, down to 1.6 on
postoperative day number five.

By the evening of postoperative day number four, it was
decided that the patient was appropriate for extubation.
After extubation, the patient initially had some stridor
which was treated with racemic epinephrine with good
resolution.  It was also noted on the evening of
postoperative day number four that the patient had a diffuse
maculopapular rash on her back, which was thought to be
contact dermatitis.  By postoperative day number five, the
rash was noted to be worsening.  A dermatology consult was
obtained which felt that the rash was due to a combination of
contact dermatitis with an element of miliaria and
recommended flying Clobetasol ointment to her back as well as
Benadryl prn.

On postoperative day number five, the patient was started on
routine beta blockers which were increased.  On postoperative
day number six, the patient was transferred from the
Intensive Care Unit to the regular medical floor. The patient
began ambulating with physical therapy.

On postoperative day number six, the patient was noted to
have symptoms of dysuria, urinary frequency and urinary
urgency.  A urine culture was sent which was subsequently
positive for Enterobacter.  The patient was started on
Levofloxacin. The patient continued to have oxygen
requirement. On postoperative day number eight, it was
decided to discontinue the Amiodarone as the patient had
remained in sinus rhythm and the patient had the rash.  The
patient's rash continued to improve.  The patient continued
to ambulate with physical therapy.

On postoperative day number 12, the patient was preliminarily
scheduled to be discharged to home, after having completed
physical therapy; however, the patient's white blood cell
count was elevated to 16.  The patient was pan cultured.  On
chest x-ray, it was noted that the patient had a left sided
pleural effusion.  On postoperative day number 13, the
patient underwent an ultrasound guided thoracentesis.
Cytologic analysis of the pleural fluid showed significant
numbers of red blood cells. Microscopic evaluation showed 1+
polymorphic leukocytes, no micro-organisms. Initial fluid
culture shows no growth to date.  The patient subsequently no
longer had an oxygen requirement and was able to ambulate on
room air without any shortness of breath.  The patient's room
air oxygenation remained stable.  The patient's white blood
cell count decreased to 13 and on postoperative day number
14, the patient was cleared for discharge to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  T max of 96.9; pulse 72 and sinus
rhythm; blood pressure 140/76; respiratory rate 18; room air
oxygen saturation 94%.  The patient's weight on [**12-4**]
is 70.8 kg.  The patient was 70.4 kg preoperatively.

LABORATORY DATA:   White blood cell count of 13.3; hematocrit
of 30.7; platelet count 556.  Sodium of 144; potassium of
4.0; chloride of 106; bicarbonate of 30; BUN 14; creatinine
1.4.  Of note, the differential of the patient's white blood
cell count showed 11% neutrophils which was thought to be due
to the resolving contact dermatitis.

On physical examination, the patient was awake, alert and
oriented times three.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm
without rub or murmur.  Breath sounds were clear bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  The patient was tolerating a regular diet.
Steri-Strips were intact on the incision.  Sternum is stable.
There is no erythema or drainage.  Right lower extremity vein
harvest site, Steri-Strips are intact and there is no
erythema or drainage.  The patient's back has a resolving
rash with several areas of peeling skin and healing blisters.
There is minimal erythema.  The patient denies any
significant pruritus.

The patient's chest x-ray on [**12-4**] showed significantly
decreased effusion, no pneumothorax.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Coronary artery disease.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Status post left thoracentesis.
Contact dermatitis on back with associated eosinophilia.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
