transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
future coronary artery bypass graft.

blood pressure steady.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat -
The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  The
pharynx was clear.  The neck was supple, no jugular venous
distention, no bruits, carotid pulses 2+ bilaterally.  The
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart is
regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  Abdomen - positive bowel

erythema and no edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses are 2+
bilaterally.  Posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologically, the patient is awake, alert and oriented
times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly
intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 19.3,
hematocrit 39.8, platelet count 383,000.  Chem7 showed a
sodium 141, potassium 4.4, chloride 109, bicarbonate 22,
blood urea nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.8, blood glucose 112.
CK 6032.

Carotid Doppler showed no significant lesions seen in left or
right carotids.  Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of
35 to 40% with trivial mitral valve regurgitation, trivial
tricuspid regurgitation, aortic leaflets mildly thickened.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac
surgery service and on [**2161-1-21**], underwent a coronary artery
bypass grafting times three.  The patient had left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein
graft to posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal one, obtuse marginal two, sequential.  The
cross-plant time was 54 minutes, the coronary artery bypass
graft time was 86 minutes.  Surgeon was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and he
was assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8420**].  There were no
complications during the procedure.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well.  Following a brief stay in the Post
Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient was transferred to the CSRU
on a Milrinone drip of 0.5 and Amiodarone drip of 0.5.

On postoperative day number one, the patient had his
Neo-Synephrine weaned and his Milrinone increased for low
cardiac index.  His IABP was increased to one to two with a
mixed venous gas down at 49%. The patient had good pulmonary
issues and was able to be extubated.  The patient was up and
out of bed tolerating clear liquids and doing quite well.

By postoperative day number two, the patient had his IABP
removed, and Milrinone continued to be decreased but was
placed on Nitroglycerin for better control of his labile
blood pressure.  The patient's course in the CSRU continued
to be quite good.  He had his Amiodarone, Milrinone and
Nitroglycerin drips weaned off by postoperative day number
three and the Swan line and A line removed on this day as
well.  The patient was started on p.o. Amiodarone and was
transferred down to the surgical recovery floor.

On arrival to the surgical recovery floor, the patient was
seen by physical therapy, which determined that the patient
would be able to be discharged to home after a few sessions
of close monitoring.  While on the surgical floor, the
patient did quite well, was able to ambulate independently,
tolerated his regular diet without any difficulty, and pain
was well controlled on oral medications.  Unfortunately, the
patient did have a positive culture grown from his urine on
postoperative day number five which is [**2161-1-25**].  For this,
the patient was placed on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once
daily.  His white blood cell count was closely monitored as
was his urine.  His white blood cell count remained slightly
elevated but his urine cleared up and did not have any
positive urine culture after the initial one on [**2161-1-25**].  As
his white blood cell count remained elevated, the patient was
switched off Levofloxacin and placed on Ceftriaxone p.o.
Following three days of decreasing white blood cell count and
oral Ceftriaxone, the patient and the surgical team deemed
that the patient would be safe to send home.  On [**2161-2-1**],
the patient will be discharged to home.

Physical examination on discharge revealed the patient was
afebrile with temperature maximum 99.6, pulse 76 and sinus,
blood pressure 101/66, respiratory rate 18 per minute, oxygen
saturation 96% in room air.

Laboratories on discharge showed white blood cell count 17.1,
hematocrit 33.5, platelet count 884,000.  Prothrombin time
12.8, partial thromboplastin time 27.3, INR 1.1.  Sodium 135,
potassium 5.4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 26, blood urea
nitrogen 18, creatinine 1.0, blood glucose 97.  Calcium 9.2,
magnesium 2.3, phosphorus 4.5.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to
home and is to follow-up with his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1295**], in one to two weeks.  In addition, the
patient was instructed to follow-up with his cardiologist in
two to three weeks, and finally the patient was instructed to
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] in six weeks.  The patient
was asked to please call and make the arrangements for these
follow-up appointments.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient will be discharged in
good condition.  He is afebrile.  Pain is well controlled on
oral medications.  He is tolerating regular diet without any
difficulty and ambulating without assistance.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three
with the left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one, obtuse
marginal two, sequential.
2.  Status post cardiac catheterization.
3.  Gout.
4.  Status post esophageal bleed.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. three times a day.
3.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. three times a day.
