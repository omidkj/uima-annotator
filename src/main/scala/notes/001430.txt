History of Present Illness:
53M with multiple medical problems, transported from nursing
home to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for coffee-ground emesis, hypotension, and
tachycardia noted after dialysis. He was found to have an upper
GI bleed in the setting of fevers and sepsis. The upper GI
bleeding resolved.  Once stabilized, a CT scan was obtained
which revealed free air and a dilated thickened cecum. Because
of this, he was taken emergently to the operating room for
exploration.

Brief Hospital Course:
53M with ESRD and multiple medical problems was transported from
nursing home to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**10-25**] for coffee-ground emesis,
hypotension to 70's, and tachycardia to 130's.  NGT was placed,
which returned coffee-ground colored liquid.  He was intubated
and sedated in ED for airway protection, and given 6U PRBC, 2U
FFP, 2L crystalloid for presumed GI bleed. GI was consulted for
possible EGD and intervention.  Post-transfusion Hct was 38.
Cultures were sent, and Vanc/Zosyn were started empirically.  CT
scan of the abdomen/pelvis was done, which showed free
intraperitoneal air and fluid suggestive of perforation, and
markedly dilated colon with a sharp transition in the region of
the splenic flexure.  Of note, he was also found to have LLL
pulmonary emboli with bilateral ultrasound negative for DVTs.
He was taken urgently to the OR for ex-lap, and ileocecectomy
was performed, with plans to return to OR for washout and
closure/maturing of ostomy at later date.
.
Postoperatively, he remained stable in the TICU - on CVVH, BP
supported with pressors, Vanc/Zosyn continued, Fluc was added
for broader coverage, PPI [**Hospital1 **] for prophylaxis.
.
On [**10-27**], he was taken back to the OR for exploratory
laparotomy, removal of
[**Location (un) 5701**] bag, ascending colectomy, abdominal wash-out, ileostomy
maturation and reclosure with [**Location (un) 5701**] bag.  Post-operatively, he
became tachycardic to 200's, and was cardioverted.  An ECHO was
performed which demonstrated LVEF > 55% wuth grossly normal
biventricular systolic function.  A repeat ECHO on [**10-30**] showed
similar findings.  On [**10-29**], platelets were noted to be
significantly decreased, so all heparin products were stopped,
and HIT antibody was sent, which was ultimately came back
negative.
.
On [**10-30**], he underwent ex-lap, washout, resection of transverse
and limited descending colon for ischemic segment of splenic
flexure.  Exploratory laparotomy, washout, transverse colectomy,
closure with a [**Location (un) 5701**] bag and left groin dialysis
catheter placement.
.
On [**2169-10-31**] he had a IVC filter placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
prophylaxis, h/o L subsegmental PE.  He underwent abdominal
closure at the bedside (sutured [**Location (un) 5701**] bag to reduce abdominal
opening by ~50%).  He continued to have elevated LFTs and a RUQ
ultrasound was performed for possible cholecystitis on [**2169-11-2**],
it showed sludge without evidence of cholecystitis.  On [**2169-11-3**],
he returned to the OR for exploratory laparotomy, abdominal
washout, abdominal wall closure with retention sutures,
gastrostomy tube and tracheostomy.  Infectious disease was
consulted on [**2169-11-7**] for tailoring of his antibiotics towards
[**Female First Name (un) 564**], Enterococcus, and Basteroides grown from his cultures.
He continued on CVVH until [**2169-11-7**] whe he was transitioned to
hemodialysis.
.
On [**2169-11-9**] A CT scan of his abdomen for persistent fevers found
an 11 cm thick-walled fluid collection in the mid lower pelvis
just beneath the intralesional scar, most likely representing
abscess in this setting of cecal perforation and fever and he
underwent drainage and placement of a pigtail catheter under CT
guidance.  The placement of the drain was complicated by a
postop bleed with a decrease of his hematocrit to 23.6.  He was
managed conservatively with transfusions for the pelivc hematoma
and was transfused a total of 10 units of PRBC and 2 units FFP
up to [**2169-11-19**] when he finally stablized his hematocrit in the
27-30 range.  Repeat CT scan on [**2169-11-13**] demonstrated stable
size of the hematoma.  A repeat ultrasound on [**2169-11-17**] for
possible drainage found the large predominantly solidified
pelvic hematoma not amenable to drainage.  He continued to have
fevers daily and his lines were changed. All cultures, except
for his initial cultures from his OR swab, were negative.
During the period of management of his pelvic hematoma, he also
developed an ileus with decreased output from his ostomy and was
provided nutrition via TPN.  He stopped having fevers and his
antibiotics(zosyn, flagyl, fluconazole, and daptomycin) were
finally stopped on [**2169-11-27**].  His ileus resolved and he was
restarted on tube feeds, slowly advanced to goal.  His right
subclavian quentin catheter used for dialysis was removed and a
tunneled catheter was placed by interventional radiology on
[**2169-11-30**] in the right internal jugular vein.
.
His retiention sutures were removed on [**2169-12-2**] with his wound
healing well by secondary intention and essentially closed at
the skin.  His JP drain from his initial operation was also
discontinued with minimal output.  His pain has been
well-controlled with Dilaudid prn.  H
