CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was intubated to protect her
airway, status post mediastinal exploration.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 73-year-old female with the
below past medical history had lower extremity edema and
visited her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], on
[**2176-8-1**].  A workup was deferred at that time to evaluate a
1.5 cm thyroid nodule.  This was though possibly to be a
neoplasm, which might have explained a neuropathy that the
patient had which had defied workup with the consideration
that it might be a perineoplastic phenomenon.

On [**2176-8-5**], the patient had a fine needle aspiration of the
nodule, which eventually showed a solid 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.9 cm
mass, not a multinodular goiter but simply a hyperplastic
nodule.  However, the patient had a resultant mediastinal
hematoma with respiratory distress which was first noticed at
home post procedure.  The patient returned to the [**Hospital1 **]
emergency room and was intubated in the emergency room for
airway protection.  A CT scan showed that she had airway
stenosis distal to the endotracheal tube, so she was sent to
the operating room for mediastinal exploration.  At that
time, 350 cc of blood were drained and an additional 500 cc
of blood were lost.  She sustained a 3.5 gm hemoglobin drop
from 11.9 to 8.4.

The patient was doing well on a T-piece trial on 35% face
mask after her original intubation.  However, after receiving
blood and fluids, the patient had respiratory distress.  She
was given further mechanical ventilatory support and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management of airway problems.  [**Name (NI) **] laboratory data
before transfer were notable for a white blood cell count of
65,400 and a platelet count of 847,000.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] times 25 years, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
hematology oncology:  Her baseline CBC included a white blood
cell count of 40,000, hemoglobin of 13, hematocrit of 38 and
platelet count of 700,000.
2.  Hypo.
3.  Hip fracture with two arthroplasties.
4.  Perioperative myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular
accident at [**Hospital6 1129**], thought related
to high hematocrit and leukocytes earlier this year at the
time of her second hip arthroplasty.
5.  Polyneuropathy with a negative workup.
6.  Status post clipping of cerebral aneurysm in [**2174-1-17**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking 44 years ago.  She
drank rare alcohol.  The daughter is closely involved with
the patient's care; her name is [**Name (NI) 24592**] [**Name (NI) 1968**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] intensive
care unit nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 69**].  The
patient also has a son, who is an anesthesiologist.  She has
been engaged for several years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The family history was noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had allergies to codeine, Demerol and
possibly contrast, but she received a CT scan without
difficulty at the other hospital.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a white blood
cell count of 43,700 with a hemoglobin of 8.2, hematocrit of
24.8 and platelet count of 579,000 with an MCV of 85.
Prothrombin time was 26.6 and INR was 1.3.  There was a
sodium of 142, potassium of 4, chloride of 105, bicarbonate
of 22, BUN of 28, creatinine of 1.2 and glucose of 129.  CK
was 305.  Albumin was 3.4.  Calcium was 8.1, phosphate was
4.8 and magnesium was 1.6.  Uric acid was 8.6.  Fine needle
aspiration original results showed insufficient cellular
material for analysis.

RADIOLOGY DATA:  A portable chest x-ray dated [**2176-8-21**] showed
the nasogastric tube to be in good position with a left sided
PICC line at the superior vena cava.  The heart size was
stable with slight upper zone redistribution, right basilar
atelectasis and the left costophrenic angle off the film.
The lungs were otherwise clear with mild congestive heart
failure.  On [**2176-9-3**], a chest x-ray showed further
improvement since [**2176-8-28**] in infiltrates with no new
abnormalities, the nasogastric tube in place and the PICC at
the right atrial and superior vena cava junction.  On
[**2176-9-6**], the chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.

A head CT scan dated [**2176-8-14**] showed an aneurysm to be
present with a hypodense left frontal lobe, consistent with
encephalomalacia, a low density of the right periventricular
region and no acute processes or bleed.  A chest CT scan
dated [**2176-8-14**] showed bilateral effusions with atelectasis,
peripheral right upper lobe and lingular pulmonary embolisms,
neck hematoma which was not compressive and mediastinal
drains in place and interval enlargement of the hematoma.

CARDIAC STUDIES:  An echocardiogram of [**2176-8-8**] showed
marked left atrial enlargement, moderate right atrial
enlargement, septum bowed to the right atrium, no atrioseptal
defect, a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than
55%, normal size, right ventricular volume and pressure
overload, moderate right dilation, mild aortic stenosis,
trace aortic regurgitation, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, 3+
tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic regurgitation, trivial
effusion; from the prior study, this noted new tricuspid
regurgitation and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was continued on assist-control
ventilation and later weaned to pressure support ventilation.
A CT scan was performed to follow the neck hematoma with the
cardiothoracic surgery service following and this showed that
it was relatively stable.  Solu-Medrol was given for tracheal
edema.  A CT scan of the neck performed on [**2176-8-11**] showed a
noncompressive hematoma.  A ventilation perfusion scan was
performed on [**2176-8-12**] after the pulmonary hypertension noted
on echocardiogram was evaluated and this showed moderate
probability for pulmonary embolus, which was felt very
suggestive, given her history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].  A CT
angiography was performed on [**2176-8-14**], which was positive
for peripheral pulmonary embolus and the patient was then
anticoagulated.

On [**2176-8-15**], the patient was extubated in the operating room
with the assistant of the high risk airway team.  Since then,
she was placed on face mask oxygen with humidification.  On
[**2176-8-17**] or [**2176-8-18**], the last [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in the
neck wound was removed.  On [**2176-8-18**], the patient desaturated
to 88%, but recovered with supplemental oxygen.  She
continued on face mask oxygen.  She reported some shortness
of breath when her oxygen briefly slipped off on [**2176-8-26**].
Vigorous chest physical therapy and incentive spirometry were
provided.

On [**2176-8-27**] and [**2176-8-28**], decreased subjective shortness of
breath and fewer secretions were noted.  On [**2176-8-28**], the
chest x-ray looked substantially improved.  The patient felt
that her shortness of breath might have just been anxiety.
Ativan p.r.n. was given for this.  Antibiotics were
discontinued on [**2176-9-4**].  Thereafter, the patient remained
stable.  She had a slight desaturation to the low 90s on
[**2176-9-6**], but was mouth breathing at the time and not taking
her nasal cannula oxygen.  A chest x-ray showed mild
pulmonary edema, thought to be related to fluids given at the
time of her PEG placement and she was given 20 mg of Lasix.
She was saturating well and was comfortable at the time of
discharge.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  For her coronary artery disease, beta
blockade was titrated up slowly and her cholesterol was
checked.  Aspirin was held for a question of platelet
dysfunction with the polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].  The patient had an
echocardiogram on [**2176-8-8**], which showed pulmonary
hypertension with a gradient of greater than 66 and tricuspid
regurgitation with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
Hypertension became an issue after ea
