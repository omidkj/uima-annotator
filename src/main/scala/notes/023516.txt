hypoxia, shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 62 year old female who complains of HYPOXIA.
Patient from rehab, tx from [**Hospital3 13313**] with Shortness
of breath (SOB) and hypoxia.  She s/p right ankle surgery this
past week, on levaquin for pneumonia post op (started a week
ago, still on levoquin).  She had a sudden worsening of
respiratory distress today with saturations in the 80s.  Chest
x-ray at outside hospital shows infiltrates worse on the left
side.  She is on Coumadin but INR only 1.7.  Her outside doctor
he confirmed with her that she is DNR/DNI and currently refuses
intubation. 97% O2 saturations on non-RB. Given nebs X 3 en
route.
.
As per OMR note from Infectious disease (ID, OPAT), "she had
recent admission was for right foot hardware infection s/p
removal of external fixation device, found to have line-related
blood stream infection (Vancomycin resistant enterococcus - VRE,
CoNS), right foot osteomyelitis with VRE, ESBL Klebsiella, and
staph aureus (with hardware in place), urinary tract infection
(UTI) with ESBL klebsiella and possible PNA. Additionally,
patient has significant antibiotic allergies to penicillin (PCN)
and sulfa. PICC line was removed, subsequent cultures were
drawn. Recommended endocarditis eval bc of VRE, CoNS BSI.
Transthoracic echo (TTE) was negative for vegetations. For
treatment, ID recommended daptomycin for VRE blood stream
infection and daptomycin + meropenem for osteomyelitis; and
meropenem for UTI (ESBL klebsiella). Because the patient has
osteomyelitis with hardware in place, she requires indefinite
suppression, the VRE was sensitive to levofloxacin and will be
the [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for longterm oral suppression after pt completes 6-wk
course with daptomycin and meropenem. However, the meropenem was
stopped on [**7-6**] transiently and was re-instated on [**7-8**]."
.
In ED, initial vitals were:  96.7 94 124/76 24 97%
Non-Rebreather.
Exam was significant for b/l rhonchi no wheezing, no splinter,
rle in caste, neurovascular compromise, b/l edema noted. Labs
were significant for Hct of 25 baseline of 25-28, INR of 1.8.
Patient underwent Xray "multifocal PNA" per read. Patient was
given Vancomycin and meropenem.  Patient was not seen by any
consults. Patient was admitted for multifocal PNA.  Vitals prior
to transfer 97, 88, 134/72, 25, 95% NRB, 3 PIV.
.
On the floor, she appears to be comfortable.

Imaging:

CT chest [**7-15**]
INDICATION: 62-year-old woman with diabetes and diabetic
nephropathy and
hypoxia, to rule out pulmonary embolism.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced CT of thorax was performed using
the standard
department protocol to evaluate pulmonary embolism. Contiguous
axial images
at 5 mm and 2.5 mm slice thickness were reviewed concurrently
with coronal and
sagittal reformats. Comparison was made with limited available
sections from
a prior abdominal CT dated [**2132-6-24**].

FINDINGS:
PULMONARY ARTERY: The study is technically adequate for
evaluation of
pulmonary embolism. The main pulmonary artery proximal to
bifurcation
measures 3.9 cm in caliber and is enlarged suggestive of
pulmonary artery
hypertension. No filling defects seen within the main, lobar,
segmental and subsegmental branches to suggest pulmonary
embolism. No right heart strain or septal bulge.

LUNGS AND AIRWAYS: Central airways are patent till subsegmental
level.
Extensive multifocal pneumonic consolidation seen bilaterally
relatively
sparing the lower lobes basal segments. No areas of cavitation
seen within the
consolidation. Bilateral simple pleural effusions are minimal.
There is no
pneumothorax.

MEDIASTINUM: Multiple enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the
mediastinum and
the bilateral hilum, for example a precarinal lymph node
measures 1.9 x 1.4 cm
(4:14), right hilar node 13 x 10 mm (4:30) and a left hilar node
1.5 x 1.1 cm
(4:22). Heart is normal size without pericardial effusion.

ABDOMEN: The study is not tailored for evaluation of abdomen;
however,
limited views revealed partially imaged 4.0 x 5.4 cm lesion of
fluid
attenuation located in the lesser sac. This lesion is better
characterized on
the prior abdomen CT dated [**2130-6-25**] and kindly refer to
the
corresponding CT.

BONES: No bone lesion suspicious for malignancy or infection.

IMPRESSION:

1. There is no CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. Extensive multifocal pneumonia involving both lungs.

3. Multiple enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over the phone on [**7-15**], [**21
