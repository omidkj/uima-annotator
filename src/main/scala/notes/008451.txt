Imaging:
[**2161-1-28**]
- Chest X-Ray, PA and lateral: At the margin of confluent
perihilar opacification, left greater than right, is
interstitial abnormality or lymphatic engorgement.  The heart is
normal in size. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
There is no free air under the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Probable pneumonia, including atypical varieties
such as Legionnaire's disease.

- CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Confluent ground-glass
opacities are noted at the lung bases, right greater than left,
with relative subpleural sparing. The opacities are mostly
bronchovascular in distribution. There a
