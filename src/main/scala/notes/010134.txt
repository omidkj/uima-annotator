THYROID U.S. PORT Study Date of [**2187-4-12**] 2:44 PM
FINDINGS: The right lobe of the thyroid measures 5 x 2.2 x 1.9
cm. The left lobe of the thyroid measures 4.5 x 1.8 x 1.7 cm.
Within the left lobe, there is a 7 x 6 x 8 mm septated colloid
cyst. Within the right lobe of the thyroid, there are two vague
hypoechoic nodules, which are too small to measure accurate but
appear less than 5 mm in diameter. At the level of the thyroid
isthmus, the approximate distance between the surface of the
skin and the anterior wall of the trachea is 3 cm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Approximately 3 cm between the skin surface and anterior wall
of the
trachea at the level of the thyroid isthmus.
2. Left 8 mm thyroid lobe colloid cyst.
3. Very vague small sub 5 mm right hypoechoic nodules.
4. No evidence for thyromegaly.



Brief Hospital Course:
43 yo F with dwarfism, chronic hypercarbia, obesity
hypoventilation syndrome transfered for tracheostomy evaluation,
expired during admission

Chronic respiratory failure likely due to hypoventilation of
obesity.  Arrived intubated from outside hospital at [**Hospital1 1562**]
intubated for ENT evaluation.  After evaluation with neck
ultrasound (unable to fit into CT due to body habitus), ENT
placed a trach in the OR.  On the night after trach was placed,
airway was lost and patient was bagged for several minutes while
hypoxic.  She was intubated endotracheally and ENT replaced a
longer trach, and patient was kept paralyzed and sedated in
order to prevent losing the airway and allow tract to
epithelialize.

After trach was replaced, patient was found to be febrile with
evidence of VAP on CXR, along with blood cx positive for gram
negative rods.  She was started on broad antibiotic coverage.
On further discussion with family, it was decided that being on
the ventilator chronically was not in line with patient's goals
of care so it was decided to pursue comfort measures rather than
aggressive treatment.  Patient expired on [**2187-4-17**].  Autopsy was
declined.
