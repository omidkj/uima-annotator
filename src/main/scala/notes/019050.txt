Pertinent Results:
CXR [**5-25**]:
AP bedside chest with no comparison exams at this facility.
There are bilateral calcified pleural plaques, more prominent on
the right. The lungs are relatively hyperinflated with equivocal
vascular attenuation particularly on the right. Allowing for low
diaphragms, the heart is upper normal in size with moderate
prominence aorta. No vascular congestion or consolidations.
Vague opacities in the right lung probably reflecting en face
pleural plaques. Slight prominence superior mediastinum
consistent with tortuous thoracic outlet vessels.
IMPRESSION: Asbestos exposure and probable asbestosis. No acute
process. Previous comparison radiographs might be helpful.
.
CTA [**5-25**]:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Tracheal wall thickening. Close approximation with the
esophagus raises the possibility of tracheoesophageal fistula.
Further investigation with esophogram is recommended.
Bronchoscopy is also recommended to exclude underlying tracheal
malignancy.
3. Bibasilar aspiration/pneumonia.
4. Finding suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.
5. Calcified pleural plaques indicative of prior asbestos
exposure.
.
EKG: NSR @ 107. nl axis. <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression V4-6.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 84 yoM w/ a h/o CAD, DM, COPD, recurrent aspiration pna who
p/w hypoxia likely secondary to aspiration pna w/ possible
tracheoesophageal fistula.
.
# hypoxia: likely secondary to aspiration pna given CT findings.
Question of whether PNA was recurrent aspiration possibly
secondary to a tracheoesophageal fistula given findings on CT of
thickening of trachea and possible fusion of trachea &
esophagus. However, esophogram showed no evidence of fistula.
There was then concern for potential pulmonary malignancy.
Patient continued to aspirate throughout hospitalization and had
difficulty with secretions requiring chest PT and frequent
suctioning. He completed a 9 day course of vanco/levo/flagyl for
aspiration pna. There was no culture data available to steer
treatment as all cultures were contaminated.  Management of
tracheal thickening and aspiration discussed below.  He was not
discharged on further antibiotics.
.
# aspiration: patient presented with aspiration pna and had a
history of aspiration pna in the past. He was evaluated with a
bedside swallow which he passed and was started on a ground
solid/thin liquid diet.  However, patient continued to aspirate
clinically and was again made NPO.  Options were discussed with
patient and family and they initially decided to pursue PEG tube
placement. However, after further consideration, patient decided
that he did not want to pursue the PEG.  Also during admission,
because of aspiration of even oral secretions, patient required
frequent suctioning. This caused the patient great discomfort.
This prompted him to request that we move more towards a comfort
approach.  Options were again discussed with patient.  He
requested returning to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where he "is happy".  It
was explained to the patient that he was likely to have
recurrent aspiration there and without suctioning and other
pulmonary toilet, he would certainly have recurrent respiratory
distress. Palliative care was consulted who also met with the
patient. They also felt that patient had good insight and that
he was clear about his wishes to pursue comfort care.  It was
therefore decided that he would return to [**Last Name (un) 2299**] house where he
could eat for comfort but would not be rehospitalized for any
acute events and focus would be on making him comfortable.
Scopolamine patch was given to aid with secretions and a
morphine elixir prescription given to help with comfort.
.
# tracheal thickening: Question of malignancy given history of
asbestos exposure and smoking history.  Pulmonary was consulted
regarding the best way to diagnose and potentially treat this
problem.  However, patient voiced his wishes not to have any
procedures performed to diagnose or treat this potential cancer.
 He had no desire to know if he had cancer and the problem was
not pursued any further.
.
# UE clot: patient was noted to have UE swelling and an
ultrasound showed a R superficial cephalic vein DVT. However, as
he had guiaic positive stools in the hospital with a slowly
declining Hct, he was not anticoagulated.  His swelling was
treated with limb elevation with good effect.
.
# C diff:  patient had stool
