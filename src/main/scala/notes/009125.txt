Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

History of Present Illness:
60 y/o male with CHF, HTN, presented to [**Location (un) **] on [**11-6**] with
shortness of breath. Per patient, he rarely received medical
care prior to this admission and had no known heart disease. He
noted progressive worsening of DOE over the past 6 months. Over
the past few weeks, he noted a significant worsening of DOE, as
well as orthopnea and PND. Then a few days prior to presentation
he noted LE edema which prompted him seeking medical care. He
denied chest pain at any time. He did have some N/V over the
past few weeks which he attributes to poorly fitting dentures.
He has had a dry cough for some time. Denies fever. At [**Location (un) **],
he was treated with bronchodilators, antibiotics for ? PNA, and
nitro gtt, ACE, bblocker and diuretics for CHF. He had an
elevated BNP and TropI in the borderline zone. He was started on
ASA, plavix as well. He diuresed at least 1 liter with
significant improvement in symptoms and LE edema. On [**11-7**] he
had a pharmacologic stress that showed mostly fixed inferior and
lateral defects and an EF of 15%. On evening of [**11-7**], he became
symptomatically hypotensive (SBP 60s). He was given 250-500cc
IVFs, started on Dopamine drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient's BP was 88/50 off dopamine and he
denied chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness.

.
[**2108-11-8**] CXR: cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.
The patient is rotated rightward which makes it difficult to
evaluate right lung base and right hemidiaphragm. There is a
round lucency superimposed over the right side of the heart
which may represent hiatus hernia.
.
[**2108-11-9**] Cardiac catheterization: 1. Coronary angiography
revealed a left dominant system. The LMCA showed
no angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis. The LAD
showed mild
to moderate diffuse stenoses along its length, to a maximum of
40-50%
stenoses. The LCX gave rise to a small OM1 and very large OM2,
with a
long 70% stenosis from the proximal to mid-LCX and extending
into the
OM2 vessel. The distal LCX was a small caliber vessel giving
rise to a
small LPDA. The RCA showed a 100% proximal stenosis with right
to right
collaterals.
2. Hemodynamic studies demonstrated severely elevated right
sided
filling pressures (right atrial pressures 23 mmHg) with moderate
to
severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure 60
mmHg), as
well as severely elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (34
mmHg)
and severely reduced cardiac index (calculated by the Fick
method to be
1.7 L/min/m2). There was no evidence of pressure gradient across
the
mitral valve, or across the aortic valve upon pullback of the
catheter
from the left ventricle to the aorta.
3. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 30 Cross sail balloon and
stenting using  two 3.0 X 23mm and one 3.0 X 13 Cypher stents of
the
proximal/mid CX and OM2 branch with lesion reduction from  70%
to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or
embolisation. (see PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic dysfunction with severely elevated filling
pressures
suggestive of volume overload.
3. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
4. Successful stenting of the CX lesion.


[**2108-11-8**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Rare ventricular premature beat.
Non-specific T wave inversions
in leads I and V2-V6. Broad Q waves in lead III, small Q waves
in II and aVF.
Non-specific T wave abnormalities. Possible transmural inferior
wall
myocardial infarction - old. Clinical correlation is required.
Rare ventricular
premature beat. Early transition. No previous tracing available
for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypotension: On admission his SBPs were in the low 90's
likelt secondary to diuresis and antihypertensives given at the
outside hospital. He was carefully monitored and all
antihypertensives were held. His blood pressure improved to the
low 100s/70s.
.
2) Cardiomyopathy/CHF: Patient was sent for cardiac
catheterization which revealed 70% stenosis of mid-LCX, 100%
stenosis RCA, and PCWP of 34. He tolerated the procedure well
with some persistent ooze at the groin site that resolved by the
day after the procedure with pressure dressings. He had only a
small 2x2 cm hematoma. It was felt that the degree if his
coronary disease did not corrlate with the severe depression of
his systolic function and that alcoholic cardiomyopthay was also
playing a role (CI 1.7).  He was diuresed with a lasix drip in
order to avoid hypotension.  By discharge he was diursed
approximately 4-5 liters and his blood pressure remained stable.
He was started on lisinopril, metoprolol, and PO lasix all of
which he tolerated well. On day prior to discharge, he was
started on 40 PO lasix, but was net positive by 800cc by the end
of the day. Hence on the day of discharge, his lasix was upped
to 80mg PO daily. The importance of avoiding alcohol and smoking
were stressed and he was provided with information about
maintaining a low salt diet, and fluid restriction. He will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] 2 days after discharge and will have a
follow up echocardiogram in 1 month.
.
3) CAD: Carduac catheterization revelaed chronic occlusion of
RCA and mLCx 70% (with + FFR 0.45) so LCx was stented with 3
DES. He was started on ASA, plavix and metoprolol. His LFTS were
elevated but began to trend down during his hospitalization. He
was started on lipitor 10 mg po qd the day before discharge and
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] to monitor his LFT and ti
