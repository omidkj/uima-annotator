Admission Date:  [**2132-7-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2132-7-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2055-3-1**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
gentleman with a significant history of coronary artery
disease who experienced difficulty breathing on the day prior
to admission.

The patient used sublingual nitroglycerin with relief, but
later in the evening developed acute shortness of breath and
called 911 for assistance.

He was brought to the Emergency Department and was noted have
an extremely elevated blood pressure of 220/130, and also to
be hypoxic.  Electrocardiogram demonstrated ST elevations in
leads V1 through V3.  He failed a course of [**Hospital1 **]-level positive
airway pressure and was subsequently intubated.

Upon arrival in the Catheterization Laboratory, the patient
was noted to have elevated left-sided and right-sided filling
pressures and to have in-stent restenosis in both the left
anterior descending artery and right coronary artery.  The
patient underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty to the distal left anterior descending artery as
well as placement of a stent in the proximal left anterior
descending artery with good flow.  He was treated with
dopamine to maintain blood pressures and was brought to the
floor intubated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post right coronary
artery and left anterior descending artery stents with
in-stent restenosis; treated with brachy therapy in [**2132-3-8**].
2.  Elevated cholesterol.
3.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once per day.
3.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice per day.
4.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. once per day.
6.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. once per day.
7.  Glucotrol.
8.  Lipitor.
9.  Actos.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is Russian-speaking only.  He
has a 100-pack-year tobacco history.  He lives at home with
his wife who speaks English.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was
intubated and sedated.  Vital signs revealed temperature was
99.2, heart rate was in the 80s, and blood pressure was
130/60.  Head and neck examination revealed sclerae were
anicteric.  Jugular venous pulsation was elevated to the jaw.
The lungs had diffuse crackles bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  A 2/6
systolic murmur and positive fourth heart sound.  The abdomen
was benign.  Extremities were modeled with no edema and 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
studies demonstrated a white blood cell count of 13.5,
hematocrit was 30.7, and platelets were 289.  Chemistry-7
panel was significant for a blood urea nitrogen of 27 and a
creatinine of 1.4.  Initial creatine kinases were 199, with a
MB of 10.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray demonstrated
extensive bilateral infiltrates consistent with congestive
heart failure and a small right lower lobe opacity with small
bilateral pleural effusions.

Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 120 beats
per minute, with left axis deviation, left bundle-branch
block, and anterior ST elevations in leads V2 through V4.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient's creatine
kinase levels peaked at 488 on the second day of admission
and persisted at this level for two days.

After initial intervention on the left anterior descending
artery, the patient returned to the Catheterization
Laboratory on the second day of admission for stenting of the
right coronary artery.  Both left anterior descending artery
and right coronary artery were stented with drug-eluting
stents, and creatine kinase levels returned to [**Location 213**]
subsequently.

He was treated with aspirin and Plavix and was continued on
his statin.  Later during the course of his hospitalization,
the patient complained of chest pressure which he had not
experienced in the past.  These episodes of chest pressure
somewhat responded to sublingual nitroglycerin and did
resolve with morphine.

The patient returned for a Persantine MIBI to evaluate for
reversible defects as an etiology of his chest pressure.
MIBI results demonstrated a fixed moderate inferior wall
defect with an ejection fraction of 35% and global
hypokinesis.  His myocardial infarction was likely related to
elevated blood pressures causing pulmonary edema and
increased cardiac wall stress.

Given his history of in-stent restenosis, he should be
followed carefully by Cardiology for this development.

2.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient remained intubated for
several days as he was weaned off his dopamine drip.  He was
extubate successfully on [**2132-7-10**].  He had no further
pulmonary issues.

3.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  Upon extubation, the patient
developed significant hypertension and required much higher
doses of his previous antihypertensive medications.

In the future, he should have careful control of his blood
pressures to prevent the development of flash pulmonary
edema.  Since the hypertensive medications were increased,
and blood pressures of 120 to 140 were achieved the last two
days of his hospitalization.

4.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was in mild
failure on presentation and was diuresed with Lasix 40 mg
p.o. once per day.   At the time of discharge, he was
oxygenating well, and his Lasix dose was returned back to his
outpatient regimen.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Status post left anterior descending artery and right
coronary artery stents.
5.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
6.  Elevated cholesterol.
7.  Peptic ulcer disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day.
 2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once per day (times nine months).
 3.  Toprol-XL 75 mg p.o. twice per day.
 4.  Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. twice per day.
 5.  Norvasc 10 mg p.o. once per day.
 6.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. twice per day.
 7.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. once per day.
 8.  Glucotrol 5 mg p.o. once per day.
 9.  Actos 15 mg p.o. once per day.
10.  Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.5 mg sublingually as needed
(for chest pain).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient was to follow
up with his primary cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1026**] [**Name (STitle) 1016**]) in one
week.
