phone.
.
Pt is a 48 y.o female with h.o hemoglobin SC with baseline HCT
of 38, depression with psychosis, splenomegaly, s/p CCY, asthma
who presented to [**Hospital3 **] per report on [**10-15**] with LUQ
pain, nausea with vomiting and diarrhea, dark colored urine, and
low grade fever. Per report.
Pt states that her symptoms acutely began friday with
sharp/stabbing LUQ [**11-24**] pain with nausea and vomiting. Pt
reports that she had "fever" and chills [**Last Name (un) **]/fri. She also
reports diarrhea, ST and cough [**Last Name (un) **]/fri, now resolved. She
reports that she had similar pain several months ago when she
had her gallbladder removed. She also reports that she has SOB
and chest pain with her abdominal pain when she takes a deep
breath. She denies travel, new foods, sick contacts, change in
weight or appetite, dysuria, melena, brbpr, headache, dizziness,
rash. She does report b/l hand paresthesias and overall
"weakness" Currently, she reports her pain is [**11-24**] as described
above.

Hct 22.9, wbc 26.4, LFT= alk phos 364, t bili 4.1, ast 96 alt
53, albumin 2.8 INR 1.0. Patient was admitted for splenic
infarct and ?hemolysis. Hct downtrended to 20 was transfused 2U
and this corrected to 28. She was started on levaquin and iv
fluids. Today, her labs showed increasing T bili 9.4, direct 6.4
AST/ALT 127/68. Hematology was consulted and concerned that
level of hyperbilirubinemia with ct showing extra/intra hepatic
biliary dilitation (CBD 7mm) may be more than just hemaglobin SC
disease and may have obstructive jaundice/?cholangitis. Surgery
was uncomfortable with performing splenectomy with current lab
abnormalities. Vitals: T: 98.6 BP:126/64 HR:106 RR:20 O2 Sat:95

Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
OSH: KUB-[**10-14**] no definate evidence for obstruction or
perforation. Marked splenomegaly is noted. s/p CCY s/p APPY

CT abdomen [**10-15**] trace b/l pleural effusions and mild dependent
atelectasis. mild intra and extrahepatic biliary dilatation. CBD
7mm. marked splenomegaly has increased. Large areas of decreased
perfusion spanning the entire length of the spleen. Could be
from infiltrative tumor vs. infarct. Small spigelian hernia on
R.containing fat.
IMpression: increased splenomegaly with extensive areas of
decreased perfusion. This could be infarct or infiltrative
tumor. F/u recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Pt is a 48 y.o female with h.o hemoglobin SC disease,
depression, asthma, splenomegaly presented to OSH with LUQ
pain/fever found to have a splenic infarct, anemia s/p
transfusion, and hyperbilirubinemia.
.
#hyperbilirubinemia/?bile duct obstruction/transaminitis vs.
hemolysis-Pt with increasing bilirubin during admission to OSH.
Bili increased to 9.4, direct 6.4. Etiologies one can consider
are hemolysis from hemoglobin SC disease vs. biliary
pathology/obstruction. Per report from OSH, CT showing intra and
extrahepatic biliary dilatation. Primarily direct bilirubinemia.
LFTs slightly elevated and pt with fever. In addition, pt found
to have worsening anemia.
-trend LFTS/bili
-ERCP is aware and would like to get an MRCP to evaluation for
obstruction.
-MRCP ordered
-trend HCT
-hematology consult in am.
-zosyn to cover for biliary pathology
.
#LUQ abd pain/?splenic infarct-Pt presented to OSH with LUQ pain
and fever. Found to have an acute splenic infarct vs.
infiltrative tumor. Etiology is likely from SC disease. However
one can consider PFO, afib, trauma, hypercoagulable state. Pt
has not been anticoagulated.
-hematology c/s
-general surgery c/s to determine need for splenectomy
-will d/w hematology need for immunization against H.flu,
pneumococcus and Neisseria as well as anticoagulation.
-pain control with IV morphine, tylenol
-trend HCT
.
#fever/leukocytosis-likely due to the above. Splenic infarct.
However, given fever, transaminitis/elevated bilirubin can
consider biliary etiology such as cholangitis in addition will
have to consider PNA given fever/leukocytosis (LLL ? infiltrate
at OSH). Could be due to sickle crisis.
-bcx
-ua and cx
-repeat CXR
-zosyn empiric coverage for now. Will have low threshold to add
vancomycin.
-stool cx
-aggressive IVF
.
#normocytic anemia-likely due to chronic SC disease as well as
?splenomegaly. HCT 28 appears stable.
-will consider iron studies
-trend HCT
-guaiac stools
-active T+S
.
#hemoglobin SC disease-Pt's symptoms, fever, splenic infarct,
leukocytosis, chest pain could all be due to sickle cell
vasocclusive crisis. Heme is aware of patient and will be
consulting in am.
-IVF fluids
-pain control as above
-oxygen
-antibiotics as above
-transfuse prn
-trend HCT
-will d/w HEME need for folate/hydroxyurea
-ordered RBC smear, coags, fibrinogen, retic count, LDH,
parvovirus, coombs
.
#asthma-no signs of active flare currently (no wheezing)
-albuterol prn
.
#depression-per report h.o psychotic depression.
-continue fluoxetine, ativan, perphenazine, ativan
.
#FEN-NPO, IVF

#access-PIV

#floor course: Pt xferr'ed to floor [**2155-10-23**]. Diet was advanced
to regular on [**2154-10-24**] which pt tolerated well. JP was sent for
amylase which revealed amylase 27K, however with minimal JP out.
Continued to tolerate diet. Transitioned to po pain meds. Pain
well controlled on oral pain meds. On day of discharge pt and
staff felt safe for patient to be dispo'ed home with close
follow up. Pt and family educated on drain care. Pt would
measure drain output daily. Would follow up in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic in one
week for staples and drain to be removed. Prior to discharge was
given Pneumococcal vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae vaccine,
Meningococcal vaccine. Pt instructed to follow up with PCP as
well, to be re-vaccinated in about 2 weeks.
