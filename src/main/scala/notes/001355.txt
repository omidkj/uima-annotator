DIAGNOSIS:
Syncope.
Hyperkalemia.
Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was brought to the
Emergency Room from [**Hospital1 **], status post syncopal episode
while being turned in bed that lasted about 30 seconds.  Her
electrocardiogram showed a junctional rhythm ad they decided
to bring her in.  The patient was previously discharged from
the Medical Intensive Care Unit on East the day prior to stay
that was from [**3-15**] for congestive heart failure secondary to
fluid overload.  Prior to that from [**1-6**] to [**1-31**]
he patient was admitted for pseudomonal pneumonia and was
intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure and had a
tracheostomy placed.  At that point she went to [**Hospital1 **] and
bounced back on the [**1-31**] where she stayed until the
28th and then went to [**Hospital1 **] for a day prior to her arrival
in he emergency department.  In the emergency department her
ventilation was set at 35 and an FIO2 of 40 with tidal
volumes around 400 and a PEEP of 5.  She was anxious although
she did not have any chest pains and her potassium was found
to be 7.8 nonhemolyzed.  At this point she was given
Kayexalate bicarbonate, D50, insulin, calcium gluconate and
Ativan.  Her repeat potassium became 6.1.  She was bolused
with normal sodium and had adequate urine output.  Upon
admission her temperature was 99 degrees orally.  Her blood
pressure was 80/52 with a heart rate of 65 to 117,
respirations 22 to 24, oxygen was [**Age over 90 **] year-old 97 percent on
the prior ventilation setting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was in bed.  Her tracheostomy was
in place.  The PEG was in place, in no apparent distress.
Alert to voice.  Her pupils were equal and reactive to light.
 Extraocular muscles intact.  She had moist mucous membranes.
 Lungs - she had scattered wheezes bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: she was sinus tachycardia with a III/VI
systolic ejection murmur at the apex.  Her abdomen - the PEG
site had serosanguinous drainage with erythema.  It was soft,
nontender, with positive bowel sounds and she had right lower
extremity edema.  Neurologic examination was intact.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for 1) nonHodgkin's
disease in [**2125**] treated with CHOP and radiation therapy
complicated by histoplasmosis, ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis and
bronchiectasis.  Also had a left pneumonectomy in [**2122**]
secondary to aspergillus.  Last pulmonary function tests are
[**2130-9-18**] with an FVC of 0.6, FEV1 to FVC of 68 and
severely depressed total lung capacity indicating severe
mixed obstructive and restrictive disease.  2) Tuberculosis
in [**2121**].  3) Status post splenectomy. 4) Anxiety and
depression/insomnia.  5) Cardiomyopathy with ejection
fraction of 20 percent diagnosed in [**2124**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is single, lived with her mother
prior to her [**Hospital1 **] admission and reports a five year
tobacco use in college.  Occasional alcohol and no
intravenous drug abuse.

As far as her admission physical examination and recent
physical examination please refer to the prior Discharge
Summary for this hospital stay.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission she had white count of 15.6
with differential of 82% neutrophils, 11 lymphocytes, 6
monocytes, hematocrit 35.7, platelets 467.  She had sodium of
133, potassium 7.8, was not hemolyzed, repeat was 5.6.  She
had chloride of 88, bicarbonate 37, BUN/creatinine 36/0.5
with glucose of 138.  Her troponin was less than .3. Digoxin
1.5.  CK was 15, magnesium 2.0, calcium 8.3, albumin 2.6.
Her urinalysis at this time was negative ad chest x-ray
showed improving congestive heart failure.  Electrocardiogram
showed sinus tachycardia at 122, normal axis and no
hyperkalemic changes, no ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE ISSUES:

#1:  Syncope.  Thought to be a vasovagal event.  Patient had
another similar episode while in the hospital while being
suctioned, likely also vasovagal.  Her potassium was
corrected and she was kept on telemetry during her entire
stay and remained in sinus rhythm for the majority of the
time.

#2:  Potassium issues.  She came in and was hyperkalemic.  it
was corrected by holding her Captopril and tube feeds and
hydrating her with normal saline.  It was normalized by
hospital day two.  On hospital day five patient became
hypokalemic at 2.6 and was started on daily potassium
supplements.  This continued to be a problem throughout her
stay and currently has been normalized with a standing dose
of 80 mg of potassium chloride p.o. b.i.d. and a sliding
scale in addition.  She has been requiring b.i.d. potassium
checks. She has not had any electrocardiographic changes
secondary to her hyperkalemia.

#3:  Pulmonary disease.  She came in on the PCZ 35, FIO2 of
40 percent, PEEP was 5.  Se was changed to pressure support
and underwent trach trials throughout part of her stay.  She
tolerated a carbon dioxide of 50 to 55 and that was her
baseline.  As her diuresing progressed the patient tolerated
decreased pressure support for about a week and over her last
week of her stay she has been having increased tachypnea and
tachycardia requiring increased pressure support, now on a
pressure support of 20 divided with 5 with an FIO2 of 40.
Tidal volumes running from 200 to 400.  She received
albuterol, Atrovent and Serevent and finished a 28 day course
of Tobramycin which needs to resume on [**5-4**].  This is
prophylactic every other month for pneumonia.  Continues to
be weaned from the ventilator as tolerated.  She will resume
trach trials in rehabilitation.

#4:  Cardiovascular status.  She has had cardiomyopathy with
an ejection fraction of 20 percent.  She is on q.o.d. Digoxin
dosing and receives 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix.  On
admission her weight was over 60 kilograms, about 20
kilograms over her dry weight secondary to fluid overload.
She was started on intravenous Lasix diuresis and was
transitioned to p.o. with a goal of minus 1 to 2 liters per
night.  In addition, Zaroxolyn p.r.n. for improvement in
diuresis.  Baseline she is hypotensive running in the 80s/50s
and tolerates her Lasix doses even with this low blood
pressure.  She was initially given Captopril for afterload
reduction.  This was discontinued secondary to hypertension
and she has been doing well on he Digoxin and Lasix.  Also
throughout her stay she had multiple episodes of
supraventricular tachycardia, usually in the middle of the
night running up to 150, most likely secondary to her
hyperkalemia interfering with her Digoxin.  Most of the time
it resolved on its own and Diltiazem was used once.  She is
currently without any symptoms from this.

5: Infectious Disease.  She had a fever on admission, was
started on Vancomycin secondary to line infection.  She was
on this from [**3-18**] to [**3-20**].  She was also on Tobramycin for 28
days for prophylactic therapy for pseudomonal pneumonia and
she was on Ancef for five days starting [**3-27**] for status
post J tube placement and then placed on Ancef for three days
on [**4-13**] for cellulitis at her J site.  As far as
microorganisms she had positive blood cultures on [**3-16**] that
grew out coagulase negative staph.  Her sputum on [**3-17**] grew
out sparse yeast.  Blood cultures after that were negative.
Urine grew out yeast on [**3-28**].  The patient was
