Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 57100**] is a 56 yo M with history of CAD s/p cath [**2096**] showing
3VD undergoing medical managment, CHF with EF 20%, DM, and
severe PVD.  He presented this admission with intermittent chest
pressure/tightness. The patient was in USOH until the morning of
admission when he suffered chest tightness, progressive in
freuqency over the day. The episode that morning lasted five
minutes, then resolved with nitro. The next several episodes
were also releived with nitro. He pain was localized to the left
size of his chest. He denies associated SOB, LHD/dizziness, N/V,
diaphoresis, palpitations.
Cardiac cath [**1-5**] showing 60% pLAD, 90% mLAD, subtotal occlusion
of D1 and D2, 60% D3, 70% OM4, 60% OM2, small OM1 and OM2, 80%
RCA.
He was referred for coronary artey bypass grafting at this time.
 Pre-op workup included carotid us (no evidence of stenosis in
eother carotid artery), LE vein studies, repeat echo (EF
20-25%), renal consult and ID consult.It was decide that patient
was safe to preceed to the OR.
He underwent a coronary artey bypass graft x 3 with LIMA to the
LAD, SVG to the RPL, and SVG to  the PDA  on [**2103-1-9**] with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].  Please see OR report for full details.
He was initially slow to [**Doctor Last Name **] from ventilator but was
successfully weened and extubated on the morning of post-op day
one.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 387**] consult was also obtained on that day for optimal
glucose management.
One POD 2, he remained hemodynamically stable.  And underwent
initial evaluation by physical therpay.
POD 3 was significant for sternal drainage and strict sternal
precations were initiated as well as IV vancomycin.
On POD day 4 he was transferred to the floor for ongoing
recovery and rehabilitation.
The next several days were uneventful with ongoing physical
therapy and monitoring of sternal wound with administration of
intravenous vancomycin.  He also continued to be closely
followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] team and was restarted on his insulin
pump on POD 7.
Mr. [**Known lastname 57100**] had an open wound on his right BKA stump for which
vascular was following him and on POD 11 ([**2103-1-19**]) it was decided
that he resume use of prosthesis on that side, allowing for
significantly increased ability to ambulate and participate in
physical therapy.
His last documented sternal drainage was [**2103-1-19**].  He was
continued in vancomycin for the full 14 day course and it was
discontined on [**1-23**].  It was felt that Mr. [**Known lastname 57100**] would be safe
for discharge to rehabilitation at this time but there was some
difficulty finding a rehabilitation facility that would
accomodate him.
On POD 14, following discontinuation of vancomycin and increase
in activity with bilateral prostheses in place, Mr. [**Known lastname 57100**] is
awaiting a rehabilitation bed.
