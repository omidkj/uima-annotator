History of Present Illness:
41 y/o female with PMHx congenital hepatic fibrosis, polycystic
kidney disease who presented to an OSH with profuse diarrhea
starting this morning.  She notes feeling "under the weather"
for the past couple days as well.  She was tachycardic to 140
with lactate of 4.5 at OSH initially.  Received 6L IVF with
improvement in tachycardia to 125 with N/V/D.  Vomiting bilious
emesis without blood.  Diarrhea similar without evidence of
gross bleeding.  Labs were notable for a WBC of 3.3 with 13%
bandemia, HCT of 35, plateltets of 38k.  Patient was acidotic
with CO2 of 13 and an AG of 14.  Lactate noted to be 4.0.
Patient was in [**Last Name (un) **] with creatinine of 2.8.  At the OSH ED she
was given vanco/zosyn as well as 4 L NS and PO APAP.  EKG showed
sinus tachycardia with minimal ST depressions in V4-V6 and a
troponin of 0.03.  Given concern for severe sepsis, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial VS were HR 120, RR 30, BP 104/79, satting
100% on RA.  T was 101.2.  Labs showed leukopenia with WBC of
1.4 (baseline [**5-8**]) with 66% neuts, 20% bands, 3% atyps, anemia
to 30.1 (baseline 34), and platelets to 27 (baseline 100), Ca of
6.1, Mg of 1.0, K of 2.8, bicarb of 13, Cr of 2.4.  Coags showed
PT: 27.3, PTT: 43.7, INR of 2.6.  Lactate was 2.5.  She was
given 2 amps Calcium gluconate, 2gm mag sulfate, ipratropium,
and flagyl 500mg IV.  She had a CT A/P that showed her right
colon is completely collapsed which could be c/w colitis, but no
clear infectious etiology.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is alert but in moderate
respiratory distress speaking in broken sentences.

IMAGING

Portable CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has received a right internal jugular vein catheter. The tip of
the catheter projects over the right atrium and should be pulled
back by approximately 5-6 cm to ensure correct position in the
superior vena cava. IV team was paged at the time of observation
and dictation, 8:09 a.m., [**2116-6-1**].
There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly, no
evidence of pneumonia.
