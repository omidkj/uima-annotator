Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 678**]
Chief Complaint:
I fell and hurt my arm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
 82 y/o M w/ h/o CKD (cr 1.9-2.0), HTN, CHF (most recent ECHO w/
EF 60%), who presented s/p fall, found to have right humerus
fracture.
.
Fell while trying to pull off a safety strap while repairing his
boat. The strap suddenly came loose and he fell 6 feet off a
platform onto his right side. Denies associated lightheadedness,
dizziness, chest pain or palpitations.
.
In the ER, he was found to have right humerus fracture. CT head
and C-spine negative for fracture. Evaluated for surgical
repair, however patient refuses surgical intervention. Plan for
sling with follow-up in 2 weeks. However, overnight developed
decreased urine output (110 cc out over 8 hour period). Given 1L
NS bolus and placed on 80cc/hr LR. However, still w/ low uop
(~10cc/hr), bladder scan showed empty bladder. Given additional
1L NS without response. Subsequently tried 5mg IV lasix to see
if component of CHF, without effect. Creatinine noted to be
elevated from 2.1 to 3.2.

RADIOLOGY:
([**2173-8-6**])
KNEE:
Four radiographs of the right knee demonstrate no effusion.
There is mild narrowing of the medial and lateral compartment
joint space heights on non-weightbearing views. No fracture.
Small marginal osteophytes involve all three joint compartments.
There is evidence of old Osgood-Schlatter's disease. Regional
soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Mild tricompartmental osteoarthritis
.
.
SHOULDER
Three radiographs of the right shoulder demonstrate a
comminuted, displaced, fracture involving the surgical neck and
head of the right humerus. There is avulsion of the greater
tuberosity. There is impaction of the distal fracture fragments.
Acromioclavicular joint demonstrates mild degenerative change.
Visualized lung and ribs are unremarkable. Regional soft tissues
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
Comminuted and impacted fracture through the surgical neck and
head of the right humerus with avulsion of the greater
tuberosity.
.
.
CONTRAST CT ABD/CHEST:
FINDINGS: There is a large multinodular goiter with a dominant
nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid, displacing the airway to
the right. There is no evidence of mediastinal hematoma or
traumatic aortic injury. Pulmonary artery main right and left
branches are enlarged up to 3.3 cm, consistent with pulmonary
hypertension. There is dense calcification of the coronary
arteries, predominantly affecting the LAD. The heart,
pericardium, and great vessels are otherwise unremarkable. No
significant pericardial effusion is detected to account for the
FAST findings. The lungs demonstrate mild basilar atelectasis
and mild emphysematous change in the upper lobe but no
pneumothorax, contusion, or suspicious nodules or masses. No
pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
lymphadenopathy.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A large portion of the upper
abdomen is obscured by beam hardening artifact from the
patient's overlying arm which cannot be repositioned.
Specifically, evaluation of the anterior hepatic dome is very
limited, and a laceration could easily be missed in this
location. There is a small geographic hypodense focus in segment
II of the liver and an area obscured by artifact, which appears
atypical for laceration but this is not excluded. No evidence of
active extravasation. There is bilateral polycystic kidney
disease, with a dominant cyst on the right measuring 16.5 x 15.1
x 17.4 cm (transverse, AP, SI). Several of the cysts demonstrate
hyperdense components consistent with hemorrhage or
proteinaceous debris, there appears to be no free fluid or
stranding to suggest traumatic cyst rupture. No evidence of
hematoma or free fluid within the abdomen or mesentery. Given
beam hardening artifact, no definite traumatic injury to the
remainder of the abdominal viscera. No free air.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Foley catheter in a nondistended
bladder. There is no prominent mesenteric stranding or pelvic
hematoma. Large right scrotal hernia is present. No
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. No evidence of active
extravasation.
BONE WINDOWS: There is a comminuted fracture of the right
proximal humerus involving the head and surgical neck with
avulsion of the greater tuberosity. Partially imaged, as the
right arm and hand could not be moved to the study, there is the
suggestion of a perilunate dislocation involving the right
wrist, though this may be artifactual due to positioning and
correlation with dedicated wrist x-rays is recommended. There is
extensive thoracic and lumbar spinal spondylosis without
evidence of acute fracture. Patchy ground-glass opacity in the
right ilium may relate either to fibrous dysplasia or Paget's
disease but appears chronic. No acute pelvic fractures or hip
fractures are appreciated. The femoral heads are normally
located in the SI joints and pubic symphysis are congruent.
MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
confirm the above findings.
IMPRESSION:
1) Comminuted and impacted fracture of the surgical neck and
head of the proximal right humerus with avulsion of the greater
tuberosity.
2) Question of right wrist perilunate dislocation, partially
imaged on this study; while this could be artifactual due to
positioning; if there is clinical concern, this could be
assessed with a dedicated wrist radiograph.
3) Extensive beam hardening artifact from the patient's
overlying arm obscures portions of the right upper abdomen,
specifically the dome of the liver. There is a small ill-defined
hypoechoic focus in segment II of the liver, which appears
atypical for a laceration but this cannot be excluded on this
study. If this is clinical concern, an ultraound may be helpful.
No other definite evidence of traumatic injury throughout the
abdomen and pelvis.
4) Large multinodular goiter.
5) No evidence of pericardial effusion as suggested on FAST.
6) Coronary artery calcification and evidence of pulmonary
hypertension.
7) Polycystic kidney disease with the dominant right cyst,
exerting mass effect on the adjacent organs.
8) Large right scrotal hernia.
9) Question fibrous dysplasia vs Paget's disease in the right
ilium.
