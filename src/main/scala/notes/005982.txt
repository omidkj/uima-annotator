Chief Complaint:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 58848**]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy twice.  Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 52 yo M c metastatic pancreatic CA treated with docetaxel
[**3-15**].  Presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED for malaise, fatigue [**3-20**]
c fever to 101 and WBC 0.4.  At time of presentation also
complaining of intermittent reflux symptoms to liquids.  Has
history of reflux to both solids intermittently but now
reporting occasional, unusual fullness especially with
carbonated beverages.  No nausea, vomiting, however.  In
addition, reported no localizing symptoms prior to admission at
[**Hospital1 **] --> no cough, congestion, pleuritic pain, headache,
abdominal pain, dysuria, diarrhea.  At [**Hospital1 **], noted to have
febrile neutropenia.  Sputum ctx positive for Klebsiella and
yeast.  Blood ctx, urine ctx no growth to date.  Treated with
various antibiotics.  Initially piperacillin-tazobactam and
fluconazole, then transitioned to solely pip-taz.  On transfer
appears as though pt was being treated with vancomycin (stopped
AM [**3-30**]), linezolid, metronidazole, and levofloxacin.   Had CT
scan to evaluate symptoms of reflux and noted to have possible
gastric outlet obstruction.  Transfered to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of
gastric outlet obstruction and possible stenting.  Not
neutropenic on transfer.

Past Medical History:
ONC hx: Initially developed lower back pain fall [**2177**] and acute
onset of epigastric pain after PO intake in [**11-6**].  Had
ultrasound to look for biliary disease; unrevealing.  Had EGD
which showed "inflamed duodenum".  HIDA scan abnormal and CAT
scan done at [**Hospital3 4107**] showing pancreatic mass.  Underwent
EUS c biopsy + malignant cells.  Repeat CT scan [**Hospital1 18**] [**12-9**]
showed occlusion of SMV, splenic vein, involvement of arteries
of celiac axis.  Underwent staging laparascopy [**12-9**], showing no
metastatic disease in liver or abdomen.
Treated first with XRT and gemcitabine; tolerated treatment well
except for some thrombocytopenia.  Underwent repeat imaging
showing enlargement of pancreatic mass, new hepatic metastases,
omental metastatic disease.  Was then placed on protocol for
pancreatic CA with capecitabine (Xeloda) and oxaliplatin.  Had
some shrinkage of primary pancreatic mass on this protocol but
experienced paresthesias, development of intention tremor, and
peeling of skin over feet.  Xeloda stopped intermittently and
then redosed.  Also complicated by thrombocytopenia.  He
experienced persistent neuropathy but continued on protocol at
adjusted doses given stability of disease.  [**1-10**] pt. had
progression of liver lesions and was removed from protocol.
Started on docetaxel (taxotere) c neulasta injections [**2180-3-15**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52 yo M metastatic pancreatic CA admit c febrile
neutropenia.
.
Pancreatic Cancer - Admitted for concern for gastric outlet
obstruction.  Underwent upper GI series demonstrating flow of
barium into duodenum.  Tolerated imaging well but day following,
developed several episodes of hematemesis.  Then had 1 grossly
melanotic bowel movement with a 7 point hematocrit drop (27-20).
 Remained hemodynamically stable through this however.
Transfered to ICU for upper endoscopy.  On first attempt, no
clear bleeding source was determined but copious coffee grounds
noted in stomach.  Following day after requiring pRBCS without
appropriate rise in HCT, repeat endoscopy showed bleeding vessel
at GE junction.  This was clipped endscopically.  He remained HD
stable and his HCT bumped appropriately.  He was transfered back
to the oncology service. His hematocrit remained stable at 27-28
at the time of discharge.
.
Pneumonia - Treated with 10 day course of oral levofloxacin
(transitioned to IV during UGIB).  Was afebrile with minimal
cough throughout.  Repeat micro data no growth to date (needs to
be followed up). CXR [**4-4**] shows LLL atelectasis and resolved LLL
effusion (compared to CXR [**4-1**] with LLL and LML opacities).
Pleural effusion was tapped [**4-4**] which is c/w transudative
uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion.  However, there are
atypical cells with cytology pending.
.
Pleural Effusion - Noted to have new pleural effusion at time of
transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Unclear etiology; possibilities considered
included malignancy vs. parapneumonic vs. fluid resuscitation in
setting of low albumin.  Tapped in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and shown to be
transudative.  Cytology is pending.
.
Febrile neutropenia- resolved.
.
Peripheral Neuropathy - Related to hx of oxaliplatin treatment.
Continued hydromorphone for pain and discharged pt with prn
codeine.
.
Rash - Likely related to docetaxel; improved at time of
discharge
