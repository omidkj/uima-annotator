Brief Hospital Course:
Altered mental status:  The patient was initially admitted to
the medical ICU for altered mental status.  Tox screen was
negative, and hepatic encephalopathy or infection were
considered most likely.   She was given lactulose, titrating to
5 bowel movements per day, and treated for her infection (as
below), and her mental status quickly improved to baseline.
.
Urinary tract infection:  Urine culture grew pansensitive E Coli
and Klebsiella.  She was treated initially with Unasyn and
subsequently with Augmentin for a total 5 day course.
.
Cirrhosis:  Lactulose and rifaxamin were continued.   LFTs were
stable. The transplant team evaluated the patient and obtained
her recent biopsy results from [**Hospital3 **] to consider if she
might be a candidate for re-transplant. MELD was 27.  There was
some debate as to whether her recurrent cirrhosis s/p orthotopic
liver transplant in [**2173**] represented autoimmune hepatitis or
recurrent hepatitis C.  Recent hepatitis C viral load was 372
000.   Pre-transplant evaluation was continued, including Pap
smear and ABG.  She had recent PFT and echo.
.
Coagulopathy:  INR was [**1-4**], likely secondary to advancing liver
failure.  She received PO vitamin K for 3 days with no
improvement.
.
Anemia:  Iron studies suggestive of anemia of chronic
inflammation.  Patient also noted to be guaiac positive.  EGD
and colonoscopy were done, demonstrating a normal colon and only
2 cords of grade I varices in the esophagus.  She did not
require transfusion support.
.
Urethral prolapse:  The patient reported blood in her urine,
which was confirmed on urinalysis.  She was found on exam to
have a prolapsed urethra.  Both the gynecology and urology
services evaluated her.  Urology advised that no surgical
intervention was necessary, and bacitracin ointment was applied
to the mucosa to relieve irritation.
