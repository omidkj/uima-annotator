Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
58 y/o M with severe COPD with h/o mulitple intubations,
obesity, DM, h/o DVTs s/p IVC filter, who had respiratory
distress this morning. Wife called EMS for respiratory distress.
Pt intubated in the field. VS at OSH ED Temp 33.1, HR 76, RR 22,
BP 122/39, O2 Sat 98% intubated. Pt opened eyes to verbal
stimuli, foley placed; pt opened eyes to name. Pt became
hypotensive with SBP 68 so dopamine gtt started with improvement
to 137 mmHg. CXR confimred tube placement. Pt's urine output
noted to be 300-500cc, dopamine was weaned, IVF 1 L NS given.
Central line placed for access. Given plavix 300 mg, heparin
gtt, and protonix. Another 1 LS NS given. On transfer, pt given
vecuronium, fentanyl, and versed for sedation. Vent set at TV
450 cc, RR 12, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cath given STE in inferior leads. Cath showed 50% mid
LAD otherwise no flow limiting disease.
.
In the CCU, history obtained from wife. Pt was recently
discharge for PNA and COPD flare on [**4-15**]. Prednisone taper was
stopped last week. He had not been sleeping much, probably off
home BiPAP. Denied cough, chest pain, N/V or other symptoms. His
only c/o was poor sleep; no indicaiton that there was worsening
SOB or DOE. He uses oxygen and auto-BiPAP at baseline. He did
c/o some postural sxs with standing but no syncope.
.
Admitted to MICU service for hypercarbic resp distress.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year old man with severe COPD, DM, chronic low
back pain, admitted for cath, which demonstrated one vessel
disease, and with hypercarbic respiratory failure, s/p
extubation on [**2138-4-30**].

Brief ICU course:
#) Hypercarbic resp failure. Thought to be likely secondary to
severe COPD exacerbation and residual community or
hospital-acquired pneumonia, with recent rapid steroid taper.
Pt. was intially intubated in the field and transferred to CCU
in stable condition on [**2138-4-28**].  CXR showed hyperinflated lungs
and mild generalized interstitial abnormality in lower lungs of
indeterminate chronicity.  ABGs revealed pH 7.21, pCO2 128, pO2
58, HCO3 54.  PCV was started w/ PEEP 10 due to auto-PEEP in
setting of COPD.  Treatment was started w/ methylprednisolone IV
125mg IV q8h, ipratropium inh, albuterol inh, and
fluticasone-salmeterol inh.  Levofloxacin 750mg IV daily was
also started for presumed pneumonia given CXR findings.  A L
subclavian line was attempted, but found to be folded over in L
brachiocephalic vein, and subsequently removed.  On [**2138-4-29**],
mechanical ventilation was switched from PCV to AC, and ABGs
revealed pH 7.39, pCO2 85.  Vancomycin 1g IV q12 was initiated
later due to concerns for GPC in blood cx from OSH.  On [**2138-4-30**],
ventilation was weaned from AC to PSV 16/10, which was tolerated
well by the patient.  Sputum gram stain showed 1+ GPCs, and
blood/sputum cultures were drawn.  Since pt did not show signs
of infection (Tmax 99.4, WBC 5.3) at this time, abx regimen was
continued.  Pt was then weaned to PSV 5/5, and subsequently
extubated.  By [**2138-5-1**], pt has tolerated 4L NC and BiPAP at
night, w/ O2Sat in the low 90's.  Pt was subsequently
transferred from the MICU in stable condition.
.
#) ST elevations: Although pt reported no prodrome of chest
pain, EKG at OSH revealed STE in leads II, III, and AVF.  On
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], cardiac catheterization revealed only 50%
mid-lesion in LAD, but EF 63% and no wall motion abnormalities.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x2 (CK 25 cTnT 0.03 on [**2138-4-29**] and
CK 18 cTnT 0.02).  No anti-coagulation was given, and pt never
reported any CP, SOB, or palpitations
.
#) Hypotension: Pt's low SBP unlikely related to sepsis due to
absence of fever, normal WBC and lactate.  His BP stabilized
quickly with 2L NS bolus on [**2138-4-28**].  Pt was taken off dopamine
gtt, and SBPs have ranged from 100-150 for the remaining
duration of his MICU stay.
.
#) Mental status change: Pt initally very poorly responsive,
possibly secondary to paralytics and sedation en route on
[**2138-4-28**].  Pupils were unequal and sluggishly reactive to light.
On [**2138-4-29**], pt began to respond to verbal stimuli though not
following commands, pupils were less unequal.  On [**2138-4-30**], pt
could follow commands, and pupils were equal and reactive.  On
[**2138-5-1**], pt was awake, appropriately interactive, and began
asking for food.
.
#) Anemia:  Pt's Hct initially dropped from 37.8 ([**2138-4-28**]) to
32.4 ([**2138-4-29**]) to 31.1 ([**2138-4-30**]), but stabilized to 34.4
([**2138-5-1**]).
.
#) Chronic back pain: Pt continued on home narcotics regimen.
.
#) DM: Pt on ISS especially while on steroids.

Once on the floor, he continued to receive his COPD medications
and nebulizers. His home glyburide was restarted on [**5-2**]. His
respiratory status continued to be stable, and he was discharged
home on [**5-3**] on a slow steroid taper and instructed to follow up
with his PCP.
