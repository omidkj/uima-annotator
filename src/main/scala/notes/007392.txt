ADDENDUM:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50 year old female
status post breast cancer diagnosed in [**2181**], status post auto
bone marrow transplant and status post allo MUD bone marrow
transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome secondary to her
initial bone marrow transplant.  Her allo bone marrow
transplant was [**2188-8-4**].  After her allo bone marrow
transplant, she developed tachypnea, tachycardia, fever and
acute renal failure as well as respiratory failure.  She was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  For further detail,
please see the Intensive Care Unit discharge summary.

The patient was then transferred to the floor [**2188-9-8**].  This
will be discharge summary while she is on the floor from
[**2188-9-8**], through [**2188-10-4**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Acute renal failure - The patient's acute renal failure
was resolved prior to returning to the floor.  Her creatinine
was very stable.  She did not have any more need of dialysis,
making very good urine output.  No acute issue.

2.  Graft versus host disease - The patient has skin biopsy
done on [**2188-9-20**], which was consistent with graft versus host
disease.  The patient continued to be on high dose
Solu-Medrol for control.  Skin rash was stable and was
actually improving throughout her hospital stay during this
period.  The patient has episodes of diarrhea which most
likely are not due to graft versus host disease but due to
intolerance to diary product.  After the patient stopped
taking diary products, her diarrhea improved and did not
recur.

3.  Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated while in
Intensive Care Unit and was extubated also in Intensive Care
Unit.  The patient did very well while on the floor until
[**2188-10-3**].  Her oxygen saturation dropped from 97 to 99% to
about 93 to 94% and CT scan was done and actually showed the
patient to have superior segment of her right lower lobe
showing opacity, may be question of developing pneumonia.
The patient also had some coughing develop about the same
time.  The coughing was somewhat nonproductive.  The patient
was started on Cefepime.

4.  Urinary tract infection - The patient had Foley in after
she was discharged from the Intensive Care Unit for more than
a month and on [**2188-10-3**], her urine culture actually grew out
gram negative rod and she had a positive urinalysis showing
positive leukocytes as well as white blood cells.  Again,
Cefepime was started and Foley was removed.

5.  Intensive Care Unit myopathy - The patient developed both
lower and upper extremity weakness while in Intensive Care
Unit.  The patient has been working with both physical
therapy and occupational therapy regularly.  Improvement is
very slow.  The patient's muscle strength is about 2+/5 in
both upper and lower extremities throughout this period.

6.  TTP - The patient developed TTP like picture while in
Intensive Care Unit which required daily plasmapheresis.  The
patient continued with plasmapheresis until her hematocrit
and her LDH and platelet counts reached more stable status
and plasmapheresis was stopped a week ago although her
hematocrit continued to steadily slowly decrease while LDH
slowly increased.  The decision was made to restart
plasmapheresis not as frequent, most likely once per week.
The patient will receive her plasmapheresis on Monday,
[**2188-10-6**], again.

7.  Nutrition - The patient was on TPN since Intensive Care
Unit and while on the floor and her TPN has been discontinued
since [**2188-9-18**].  The patient has been taking really good p.o.
intake.  There is no active issue.

8.  Hyperglycemia - The patient continued to require some
regular insulin sliding scale doses on a daily basis.

9.  Depression/anxiety - The patient has been followed by
psychiatrist who recommended starting Risperdal both morning
and evening and for anxiety control.  The patient's
anxiousness has been better, however, still feels very
depressed.  Celexa was recommended but not started due to its
potential of interfering with platelet function and the
patient has low platelet level.

10. Lymphedema - Especially on the left arm, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had
seen the patient [**2188-9-18**], and offered some recommendation
such as splint and [**Male First Name (un) **] stocking.  The patient was not ready
for using this and would like to get down her overall fluid
retention of her whole body.  The patient while in the
Intensive Care Unit developed edema both upper and lower
extremities which could be from her renal failure and could
be from her high dose steroid use.  The patient continued to
successfully diurese in the past two weeks.  She has been
losing an average of about one liter per day and her weight
has steadily declined throughout the last two weeks.  She did
very well.

This dictation covers up to [**2188-10-4**], of her hospital course.
