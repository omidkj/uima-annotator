[**10-14**] Tagged RBC Scan -  Moderately brisk intermittent bleeding
originating from the ascending colon.

[**10-28**] CT - ?cortical infarct or pyelonephritis, small simple
left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**10-13**] from OSH with lower GI bleed since
patient was a Jehovah's witness and continued to have bloody
bowel movements. Patient was admitted to the medical ICU and
underwent a tagged RBC scan which suggested that the bleeding
eminated from the ascending colon. Angiography was then
performed which did not visualize the source of bleeding. The
patient continued to have BRBPR and the general surgery service
was consulted. Upon consultation the patient was found to have a
hematocrit of 13.7 and an emergent colectomy was offered to
resolve the active bleeding.

The patient refused blood products citing her religious
perference and all the patient was aware of all risks of the
procedure and consented. The patient went to the OR on [**10-14**] and
underwent a right hemicolectomy with ileocolostomy. The
procedure was without complications and the patient was
transfered to the TSICU in critical condition. Patient remained
on the ventilator for several days, and was started on
erythropoetin and IV Iron to maximize her RBC production
capability. She was started on parenteral nutritional prior to
return of bowel function.  She was successfully extubated on
pod# 10 and transfered to the floor once her hematocrit
stabilized. Once the patient was transferred to the floor her
hematocrit slowly increased each day and upon discharge was 23.

GI Bleed - The patient continued to have guiac positive stool
while in the ICU however these were felt to be the result of
retained blood in the colon. After the patient was transferred
to the floor patient had no episodes of BRBPR and no evidence of
GI bleeding.

Heme - Upon discharge the patients hematocrit was 23.9 which was
significantly higher than her post op Hct of 8. The patient was
started on 20K Units of EPO and will continue therapy for 1 week
as well as Iron supplementation for 1 month.

Pulm - Post operatively the patient developed a left lower lobe
pneumonia which was treated with a one week course of cipro.
Upon discharge the patient was afrebrile with a normal WBC.

GI - The patient was started on parenteral nutrition while in
the unit however was advanced to a regular diet after admission
to the floor. Patient was discharged able to tolerate a regular
diet.

CV - Patient continued to be tachycardic throughout her hospital
course as a result of her anemia. She was also hypertensive on
several occassions which was treated with IV then PO Lopressor.
Upon discharge the patient remained tachycardic and continued to
have episodic hypertension which we will have her PCP follow up
on.

GU - While in the ICU the patient developed an enterococcal
urinary tract infection which was treated appropriately with
antibiotics

Dispo - Patient will be discharged to short term rehab and will
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] in approximately 1-2 weeks
