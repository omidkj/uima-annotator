Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
75 yo W with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma presenting
with several days of increased shortness of breath and
cough/chest congestion, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management
of hypoxia.
.
She was recently admitted to the BMT service from [**Date range (1) 20565**]
where she received a number of antimicrobials to treat fever,
cough, and URI symptoms ultimately attributed to parainflenza
virus III. The patient initially tested positive for
parainfluenza on [**3-16**] and failed outpatient treatment with a
Z-pack. During this last admission she also received IVIG and a
video swallow study to evaluate chronic aspiration attributed to
hiatal hernia. On [**2191-4-4**] she started Cytoxan/Velcade/Decadron
with D8 of Velcade on [**2191-4-11**].
.
According to the patient, she has not experienced any fevers,
chills, or night sweats since discharge. She felt her symptoms
had improved dramatically, but not entirely resolved. After
receiving chemo her symptoms returned and are now worse than
before. She endorses worsening sputum production, now pink and
occasional episodes of frank blood. No sick contacts or
significant outdoor exposures. Her dyspnea worsens with laying
flat and is associated with L-sided pleuritic chest pain. She
denies PND or LE swelling, hx of blood clots, hematuria, or
rash.
.
She contact[**Name (NI) **] her Oncologist and was sent to the ED for
evaluation of potential post-viral PNA. Her initial VS on
presentation were: 98.8, 76, 136/86, 20, 88% on RA. She was
placed on a NRB and her O2 sats rose to 98%. CXR revealed b/l
pleural effusions and opacification of the bases. She received
Vancomycin and Cefepime. They attempted to wean her supplemental
O2 to 40% FiO2 on Venturi mask; however, her oxygen saturations
again dropped to the 80s. Vitals prior to transfer were 141/94,
20, 99% NRB.
.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she appeared uncomfortable and
tachypneic. She was tired, but willing to converse. She answered
appropriately and expressed a need for pain medication to
control her "rib pain."
.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI, + N/V/D attributed to recent chemotherapy
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness. Denied chest pain or palpitations. Denied
constipation or abdominal pain. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias
or myalgias or rash.

.
Past Oncologic History:
"She is most recently status post five cycles of bendamustine
with her fifth cycle on [**2191-1-28**]. She was noted for increasing
lower back and right hip pain and underwent an MRI of the
thoracic and lumbar spine on [**2191-1-29**], which showed unchanged
extensive myelomatous involvement of the thoracic vertebrae with
no evidence of an epidural soft tissue mass. There were chronic
deformities of T7 through T12 and myelomatous involvement of the
lumbar spine, particularly the left anterior aspect of L4. Ms.
[**Known lastname **] developed increasing numbness of her right lower leg from
the anterior ankle and up the shin with some disruption of her
balance and gait due to this numbness. She had no changes in
bowel or bladder functioning.
She was initiated on Decadron 4 mg four times per day on
[**2191-2-4**], and began radiation therapy on [**2191-2-23**] to the
lower back in hopes of improving her symptoms. Her Decadron has
been decreased to 4 mg three times per day on [**2191-2-8**], 4 mg
twice per day as of [**2191-2-16**], 4 mg once per day on [**2191-2-25**],
and 2 mg daily as of [**2191-3-25**]. Radiation therapy completed on
[**2191-3-19**]. She also received weekly Velcade while she was
undergoing radiation therapy in order to continue to give her
some systemic therapy during her treatment. She received a dose
on [**2191-2-16**], [**2191-3-2**] and [**2191-3-9**]. She required periodic
platelet transfusions during this time.

Social History:

IMAGING
[**4-13**] Final CT Chest
1. Multifocal consolidations throughout all lung lobes. While
consolidations in the right and left lower lobes are more
consistent with bacterial pneumonia, the other consolidations
are concerning for fungal infection, specifically invasive
aspergillosis.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased since CT of
[**2191-3-21**].
3. Prominent main pulmonary artery which may be seen with
pulmonary
hypertension.
4. Large hiatal hernia.

CXR [**4-15**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-24**] and [**2191-4-12**]:
Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema have
improved since
[**4-12**]. Large area of consolidation at the right lung base and
a smaller
one at the left lateral to the large hiatus hernia have
worsened, consistent with progressive pneumonia.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is longstanding. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax. Right
subclavian infusion port ends in the SVC.

[**2191-4-16**]

IMPRESSION:
No acute infarcts. Small vessel
