Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea s/p toxic ingestion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 50 yo male with no significant med hx who presents
after ingestion of rust cleaner (Wink). He was at a friend's
house this am and grabbed a glass to pour his [**Location (un) **] Crush into.
After taking a sip (~10-15cc), he noted a bitter taste and asked
his friend if there was anything in the glass before. He was
told it had rust cleaner in it (Wink) which was clear in
appearance. About 20 minutes after the ingestion he began to
feel nauseated and called poison control. They told him to drink
a glass of milk and go to the ED. He was able to keep the milk
down and at no time vomited or aspirated. He felt mild burning
in his esophagus but had no CP, SOB, lightheadedness,
presyncope, syncope, visual changes, sensory changes, loss of
balance, or confusion. He also reports some heartburn, but not
frank chest pain as was initially described in the ED.
.
In the ED he was initially given water for dilution. After
discussion with toxicology, the active ingredient was thought to
most likely be 3% hydrofluoric acid with possible complication
of hypocalcemia. He was treated empirically with 1 amp of
calcium gluconate with plan to check Ca every 4 hours. GI was
also consulted and plan to perform EGD to assess degree of
chemical burn.

Brief Hospital Course:
50M w/ nausea after accidental ingestion of 10-15ml of rust
cleaner (WINK)

1. Toxic ingestion: Toxicology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and followed the
patient throughout his stay. There was concern for hypocalcemia,
chemical burn and cardiotoxic effects (cardiomyopathy). The
patient refused endoscopy despite recommendation by GI. He was
given Calcium gluconate as necessary, as his calcium did
continue to drop for the duration of his hospital stay.  He was
also started on carafate an protonix to cover for caustic damage
to his esophagus/GI tract prophylactically.   His other
electrolytes were repleted PRN.  He did not have any symptoms
from his hypocalcemia. He was able to tolerate a PO diet and did
not have any cardiac or GI side effects. He should return to his
PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] repeat calcium level tomorrow.
.

total of 10 days.  He states that he has UTIs once every couple
of years given that he has a double collecting system on his
left side.  He is followed by his PCP for this problem.  [**Name (NI) **] did
not complain of any back pain or fevers.

.
Please follow up with your primary care doctor tomorrow to make
