Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 47 M w/ DM2, ESRD s/p renal transplant (chronic rejection),
mechanical mitral valve p/w respiratory failure requiring
intubation for acute decompensation, likely secondary to
multilobar pneumonia, now extubated and on floor.
.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient was admitted for respiratory
failure secondary to multilobar pneumonia. A bronchoscopy was
done which showed no bacteria but did grow yeast.  He was
successfully extubated in the ICU and transferred to the floor
for further care.  He received a 14 day course of antibiotics
intially started on zosyn, flagyl and vancomycin but was
converted to levaquin.  He received albuterol and ipratropium
nebs as needed.  Blood cultures from the referring hospital were
negative.  In the ICU, blood cultures were drawn which grew
[**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  ID was consulted.  He was treated with a 14
day course of antifungals begining with ambisome, then
caspofungin and finally diflucan when the sensitivities
returned. He had no further issues with his respiratory status.
.
RENAL TRANSPLANT:  The patient had rising creatinine levels
throughout the hospital stay and had decreased urine output
despite lasix challenges and IV fluids.  The cellcept was
discontinued and all medications were renally dosed.  Renal was
consulted and recommended placement of an hemodialysis catheter
and [**Female First Name (un) 2286**] was started. He has continued on a tuesday,
thursday, saturday [**Female First Name (un) 2286**] schedule and has improved his volume
status. He was discharged to home on prednisone, EPO, iron, and
sevelamer. He will have outpatient [**Female First Name (un) 2286**] continuing on
tuesday, thursday, saturday.

.
FEVER: Pt spiked temp to 101 on [**1-26**] and was restarted on
vancomycin, cultures are pending. Likely source is a lower
extremity cellulitis (RLE) noted. His fevers cleared on
vancomycin and he was discharged to complete a course of 10 days
of vancomycin, to be dosed at HD. Blood cultures were pending at
the time of discharge and will need to be followed up by his
primary care provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] vancomycin will be dosed at his
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2286**] pending vancomycin levels to be drawn at dialysisl.  Of
note, lower extremity ultrasound studies and Xrays of the RLE
were negative for clot, fracture, or effusion.

.
DM2: The patient's diabetes was difficult to manage because of
his poor clearance of medications including drugs such as
insulin.  He had rapidly fluctuating finger sticks glucose
levels requiring large boluses of insulin or D50W twice.  [**Last Name (un) **]
was consulted regarding his diabetes and he was treated with
standing and sliding scale insulin. Compliance was occasionally
an issue, as the patient had frequent concerns about taking his
insulin when his po intake was less than ideal. He will need
[**Last Name (un) **] follow up after discharge.
.
AFIB: Although the patient has a history atrial fibrillation, he
was in a sinus rhythm during his hosptial stay.  He was
continued on his diltiazem for rate control.
.
MECHANICAL VALVE: The patient was initially supratherapuetic for
his INR and his coumadin was held while hospitalized.  He was
then subtherapuetic and started on heparin for a bridge.  He was
restarted on coumadin but again became supratherapuetic.  His
coumadin was again held and finally restarted prior to discharge
at a lower dose. His goal INR is 2.5-3.5 for his valve. He is
usually followed in the coumadin clinic and will continue to
follow-up there. His INR will be drawn at [**Last Name (un) 2286**] and the
result faxed to the [**Hospital3 **].  INR 4.0 at the time
of dishcharge with no evidence of bleeding and planned INR check
at HD the following day.

.
L HUMERUS FX: The patient had an old impacted L humerus fracture
with no change in alignment.  Occupational therapy worked with
the patient.  He had edema in the LUE but and ultrasound was
negative for DVT.  Orthopaedics was aware of the patient's
condition but said he should be treated non-operatively. He will
follow up with his primary care provider upon discharge.
.
R FLANK PAIN: The patient was found to have an 11th rib fracture
on plain films.  He was treated with tylenol, oxycontin and
oxycodone for pain control.
.
HTN:  The patient was restarted Procardia 60 mg daily and
Labetalol 800 mg t.i.d.  His blood pressure was well-controlled
while hospitalized.
.
GOUT: The patient was started on allopurinol every other day
given his renal function.

Mr. [**Known lastname 58784**] was discharged to home with services (home PT, lab
draws: INR, and antibiotics). Outpatient [**Known lastname 2286**] was arranged
to continue tuesdays, thursdays, and saturdays.
