Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

malaise, dyspnea, nausea, leg swelling

History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 year-old male with a history of COPD, A. Fib on
coumadin, CHF, esophageal and mental problems who presents with
malaise with dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, weakness, leg swelling,
difficulty walking and insomnia. No fevers/chills. He was
recently admitted on [**7-9**] for failure to thrive and increased
paranoia and was discharged after 5 days to home. These current
symptoms developed over the last few days, and his daughter
became concerned and brought him to the ED.
.
In ED, looked like COPD flare, was given solumedrol and nebs,
CXR found to have RLL infiltrate. Afebrile. Vanco/Ceftaz given.
Normal WBC. BNP pending. Chemistries wnl. Vitals on transfer,
98.9, 84 133/71, 88%ra. On 2-3L, sats 94-95%. Breathing at
25-30/min. UOP is meager. He is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
monitoring of his respiratory status.
.
Currently, the patient denies any pain. He admits to productive
cough of white/yellow sputum. He denies and fevers/chills/n/v.
He admits to increasing lower extremity edema, but denies
medication non compliance or dietary indiscretion.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

distress
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclerae anicteric, no epistaxis or
rhinorrhea, MM dry, OP Clear, very poor dentition.
NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical
lymphadenopathy, trachea midline

intact. Moves all 4 extremities. Strength 5/5 in upper and lower
extremities. Patellar DTR +1. Plantar reflex downgoing.
SKIN: Pale. No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis. No
ecchymoses.

Pertinent Results:
ECG: Afib at 80 bpm, left axis deviation, QRS interval
borderline normal, and QT interval normal, good R-wave
progression, TWI in V2-V5 and L, I. Compared to old dated
[**2136-7-9**], the TWI in V3 and V4 are new. Incomplete RBBB. Could be
lead placement issue.
.
Imaging:
CXR: CONCLUSION: Dense pneumonic consolidation at the right
lower lobe, with small right pleural effusion. New right upper
lobe consolidation. Follow up to clearance is recommended.
.
Video Swallow [**7-3**]: IMPRESSION: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia,
without evidence of aspiration.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-3-30**], the
LVERF has further decreased.
.
CT chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked increase in right pleural effusion, now large in size,
with
associated adjacent right lower lobe collapse.
2. New subtle left lower lobe ground glass opacities, probably
due to
subclinical aspiration, although early or resolving infection is
also
possible.
3. Overinflation of the ETT cuff.
4. Prominence of the pulmonary artery, suggestive of pulmonary
hypertension.
5. Diffuse coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
6. Emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
82-year-old man with multiple medical problems CHF with EF =
30%, [**Doctor First Name **] pulmonary infection, atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
esophageal dysmotility resistant to intervention now p/w
pneumonia.

#Respiratory Distress: Pt found to be markedly hypercarbic with
poor MS; most likely due to either 1. new aspiration event or 2.
sedation [**1-28**] to benzo causing decreased respiration and CO2
retention. This is likely all in addition to a very poor
baseline pulmonary status including a known right pleural
effusion and aspiration pneumonia for which the patient is being
treated and his known COPD. Unlikely that pulmonary edema
playing a role as pt overall appears dry.  Pt now s/p intubation
wtih goal to correct hypercarbia; will keep tidal volumes low,
Sedation with fentanyl/midaz bolus prn, Continue levo/flagyl for
now (day #3) for aspiration pna, decision made by family to
terminally wean him.
.
#[**Name (NI) **] Pt SBP was wnl however dropped upon getting
propofol; now currently BP stable after 1 Liter NS. Temp 100;
WBC wnl; Lactate wnl. Will give add'l 1L tonight to maintain BP
as pt does appear dry, Hold anti-HTN, Minimize sedation, Pt
briefly on levophed temporarily but weaned off; aim to volume
rescitate over pressors for now.
.
# COPD: Currently no indication of acute COPD exacerbation.
Continue nebs
.
#Cardiac CAD: EKG without ischemic changes; first set of CE
negative; low likelhood that ischemic event precipitated his
current status but will ROMI
