Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62M h/o cadaveric renal transplant ([**2152-12-31**]) for membranous
glomerulonephritis (previously HD-dependent x 8 years), s/p
renal artery stent ([**2153-5-11**]), presented with T 100 x 4 days

Studies:
.
# CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2153-9-16**] 10:34 AM
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is severe diffuse
calcific atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta, left
anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary
arteries. The heart is moderately enlarged. There is no
pericardial effusion. Multiple median sternotomy wires are
noted. A dual-chamber pacemaker remains in the left upper chest.
Soft tissue windows again demonstrate prominent mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. The largest lymph node is located in the
pretracheal space and measures 14 mm in diameter is relatively
unchanged in appearance compared to [**2153-7-20**] (2:22). Multiple
other, non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are
noted. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. A right lower lobe
rounded area of consolidation is unchanged compared to the
previous examination (2:41). A subcentimeter nodular mass in the
left lower lobe is relatively unchanged in appearance or size,
accounting for differences in technique, compared to the
previous examination (3:34). Compared to the previous
examination there are worsening multifocal patchy opacities
present throughout all lung fields. Stable appearance of
background centrilobular emphysema is noted.
.
Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate splenic artery
calcifications _____ a tiny calcified granuloma located within
the spleen.
.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are
present.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged appearance of right lower lobe rounded area of
either chronic organizing pneumonia versus atelectasis compared
to [**2153-7-20**]. Allowing for differences in technique, unchanged
appearance of sub- 1-cm left lower lobe nodule.
2. Interval worsening of scattered ground-glass opacities
present within both lungs but worst on the left. Infectious
etiologies such as bacterial and atypical/fungal processes
remain within the differential diagnosis. There is persistent
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive and reflective of
chronic ongoing infectious process. A small amount of underlying
mild pulmonary edema cannot be completely excluded.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-9-16**] 2:19 AM
CHEST, SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW: The heart size and mediastinal
contours are unchanged. The patient is status post sternotomy
and CABG. Dual-lead pacemaker is unchanged in position. There
remains a small right pleural effusion with fluid tracking into
the minor fissure. Retrocardiac opacity on the right persists
but has improved compared to [**2153-7-23**]. The left lung is clear.
Increased interstitial markings bilaterally persist.
.
IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion. Right retrocardiac
opacity persists although has improved, and could represent
atelectasis or pneumonia.
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2153-9-16**] 10:32 AM
Status post sternotomy with mediastinal clips. There is
cardiomegaly and unfolded aorta. A left-sided dual lead
pacemaker is present with lead tips over right atrium and right
ventricle. The lungs are diffusely abnormal, there is upper zone
redistribution, and diffusely increased interstitial markings.
There is a more confluent opacity along the left lower chest
wall and more focal opacity abutting the left upper chest wall.
At the right base, there is pleural fluid and/or thickening,
with extension into the right minor fissure. Compared with
[**2153-9-16**], the right heart border is now indistinct and there is a
new or more pronounced rounded mass at the right base.
Possibility of some superimposed CHF cannot be excluded as the
interstitial markings and upper zone redistribution is more
pronounced on the current examination.
.
IMPRESSION: Background interstitial changes in both lungs,
probably with some superimposed CHF. Right pleural fluid
thickening, unchanged. New obscuration of the right heart border
and new or more prominent right base opacity.

Brief Hospital Course:
62M h/o [**2152**] cadaveric renal transplant for membranous
glomerulonephritis, immunosuppressed, restrictive lung disease,
presented with worsening productive cough and DOE, elevated
temperature, low blood pressure, in setting of recent PNA
treated with 10-day course of levofloxacin 250mg q24h.
Pt was originally admitted to the wards but had worsening
shortness of breath and hypoxia so was transferred to the MICU.
Pt was placed on BIPAP originally, and treated empirically for
pneumonia. Pt had bronch with BAL to rule out PCP or other
fungal source of infection.  Initial cultures did not show PCP
but further cultures were pending. Additionally patient had
worsening UOP and renal transplant was consulted. Pt thought to
have rapamycin induced pneumonitis and his rapamycin was
discontinued and changed to Prograf. Pts renal failure persisted
throughout his course.  Pt was on pressors to maintain a SBP of
110 to keep renal perfusion. On [**9-21**] pt had worsening
respiratory failure and required intubation. Subsequently his
family decided that given his chronic renal failure and the
patients inherent desire not to
