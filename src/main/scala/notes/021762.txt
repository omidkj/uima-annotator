HOSPITAL COURSE:  Please see interim discharge summary done
through [**2167-4-6**], job number [**Job Number 55283**].  This interim
discharge summary covers the dates of [**4-6**] to [**4-13**].
Patient did well.  In terms of issues.

1.  Hematology:  Her hematocrit remained stable.  There is no
interval enlargement in her groin hematoma.  Vascular surgery
followed her and signed off after there was no enlargement of
the hematoma.  Her last transfusion of packed red blood cells
was on [**4-6**].  Her platelets which had initially decreased
stabilized and increased.  We did screen her for heparin
induced thrombocytopenia.  She had no antibodies to heparin.
Her most recent hematocrit was checked and we found it to be
35 and platelets of 312 and she seems to be resolving those
issues.

2.  Cardiovascular.  The patient did have some mild
congestive heart failure which was resolved with the use of
p.o. Lasix.  Her cardiac issues have been stable.  Since then
her blood pressure has been stable off any sort of pressors
and her blood pressure has been maintained within her normal
range using p.o. metoprolol.

3.  Respiratory.  There was initial concerns that patient
might have pneumonia but she has remained afebrile and after
the use of Lasix her lung issues have been stable.  We did
obtain a chest x-ray on the day of discharge to examine her
lung status and her respiratory status did not show any focal
pneumonia and did not show any fluid in her lungs.

4.  FEN/Gastrointestinal.  Patient was evaluated by FEN/GI.
She had a speech and swallow study done which showed that she
was okay to take thick liquid puree diet.  There is no
indication for her to receive a PEG tube.  We discussed
whether or not she needed to repeat a swallow and it was felt
that she would be fine at this point since there had been no
interval change in her ability.  She will be scheduled to
have repeat swallow done at [**Hospital 13698**] Rehabilitation.  We will
need to have a nutrition consult at the rehabilitation center
to see whether patient need a nasogastric tube for her feeds
or if she will obtain sufficient nutrition with solely taking
oral feeds herself.

5.  In terms of her neurologic status the patient's weakness
on her left remained quite tense with poor movement in her
arm, leg and left face.  She will need intensive
rehabilitation for this problem.  [**Name (NI) **] will be discharged
to [**Hospital 13698**] Rehabilitation facility with follow up as an
outpatient.
