Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing shortness of breath/ Positive stress MIBI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 78 yo female, h/o CAD s/p multiple caths (stents x 5),
most recently in [**8-15**] (mid-LAD drug eluding stent) who presents
to the ED after having increasing SOB. Pt says that since
[**Month (only) **], she has noticed a slow decline in her functional
status. For the past two days, she has increasing dyspnea on
exertion than in the past, not even able to walk 50 feet before
stopping; prior to [**Month (only) **], she could walk a few blocks. She
notes that she has increased her lasix dose recently without
effect. This shortness of breath only occurs during walking and
is relieved by rest. Of note, pt has not had chest pain, or jaw
pain at this time. Additionally, in the past prior to stenting,
she has never had chest pain, only jaw pain when she presented
in [**8-15**].

No recent swelling in the legs. +PND. +stable 5 pillow
orthopnea. +occasional palpitations. +12 pound weight gain past
month but this is attributed to recently starting Actos and
having to increase food consumption to regulate blood sugars.

Pt went to see PCP and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. EKG was unchanged
from previous, and two sets of cardiac enzymes were flat. Pt had
a stress MIBI test done today. Stress part showed no anginal
with no ischemic ECG changes. Thalium nuclear showed a moderate
reversible defect in the anterior wall, severe reversible defect
in the apex, all similar to [**2154-8-13**] MIBI pre stenting of the
mid-LAD.

Pt's last Cardiac catheterization from [**8-15**] showed EF 60%, mid
LAD 70% stenosis, subtotally occluded diagonal. LCx patent with
60-70% of the OM1 and  OM2. The RCA had mild lumenal
irregularities. There was mildly elevated left sided filling
pressures (LVEDP=19 mmHg). Mid LAD was stented.


Past Medical History:
1.  Coronary artery disease as above
2.  History of cardiac stent placement as above.
3.  Asthma-h/o intubation
4.  Congestive heart failure EF reduced 51->38 at last MIBI
[**8-15**]. MIBI from [**2156-3-17**] could not calculate EF.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  h/o deep venous thrombosis.
7.  Panic attacks.
8.  Diabetes type 2.
9.  S/p cholecystectomy.
10. Ventral hernia repair.
11. Anaphylactic reactions to contrast dye used in cardiac
catheterizations

arranger. Quit smoking at age 47. Smoked <1 ppd x 10 years. No
EtOH. No drugs.

Radiology

Cardiomegaly without definite evidence of congestive heart
failure.

[**2156-3-17**] Persantine MIBI-There is a severe decrease in counts
within the apex on the stress images. Counts in this area are
normal on the rest images. There is a moderate decrease in
counts in the anterior wall on the stress images. This region
also normalizes on the resting images. There is suboptimal
imaging of the septum.

Gated images reveal normal left ventricular wall motion, but
there are not
enough counts to accurately calculated an ejection fraction.
Review of the patient's prior examination dated [**2154-10-11**] shows
severe ischemia in a similar distribution. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on
[**2154-9-11**] and had a stent placed in the LAD. No interval studies
have been performed at our institution.

[**Doctor First Name **] protocol stress- 4 min; RPP [**Numeric Identifier 102484**]. Max HR was 64%. There
was no chest, arm, neck or back pain. There were no ECG changes.
The rhythm was sinus without ectopy. The blood pressure and
heart rate responses were appropriate. The Persantine was
reversed with 125mg Aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSSION: No angina with no ischemic ECG changes. Nuclear
report
will be sent separately.

[**2156-3-18**]- Cardiac catheterization- 1.  Selective coronary
angiography of this right dominant system revealed branch
coronary disease.  The LMCA was widely patent. The LAD was
patent, including the previously placed stents.  The first
diagonal branch was occluded as in her previous angiograpms.
The RCA was a large caliber, dominant vessel without critical
stenoses. 2.  Left venitrculography revealed a calculated
ejection fraction of 55%.
3.  Resting hemodynamics were widely varied throught out the
case.  A Swan [**Last Name (un) 26645**] catheter was placed when the patient became
hypoxic. Initially, the mean PCPW was 24mmHg and the PA sat was
48%.  After treatment with lasix and nitroglycerine, the PA sat
improved to 85%.
4. After completion of the LV gram, the patient complained of
headache and shortness of breath.  He SBP subsequently dropped
from the 120s to the 80s.  She was given 0.3mgSQ epinepherine
which improved her blood pressure.  She continued to complain of
shortness of breath.  She was severely agitated throughout the
case.  Because of the hypotension and shortness of breath, a PA
catheter was placed.  The patient was given a nitro gtt and
lasix IV.  A 100% NRB was transiently placed for O2 sats in the
70s and 80s.  After approximately 20 minutes, her breathing
improved and by the end of the case, she had a good O2 sat on 3L
NC. Her symptoms were believed to be secondary to allergic
reaction to contrast dye despite pre-treatment with 80mg IV
solumedrol, 25mg Benadryl, and 20mg Pepcid. During the case, she
was given an additional 125mg IV Solumderol.

the apex, all similar to [**2154-8-13**] MIBI pre stenting of the
mid-LAD.
