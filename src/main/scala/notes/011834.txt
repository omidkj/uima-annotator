CT Head [**2188-12-2**]
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture. Right
cerebellar
hypodensity likely represents encephalomalacia from remote
infarction.


[**2188-12-2**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis
IMPRESSION:

1. Large pelvic hematoma measuring 14.6 x 9.1 x 9.3 and a large
anterior
abdominal wall hematoma secondary to active extravasation from
the left
external iliac branch, most likely external pudendal artery.

2. Free fluid is noted around the liver and spleen and is
tracking into the
mediastinum with no definite evidence of solid organ injury.

3. Comminuted left trochanteric fracture of the femur with mild
surrounding
hematoma. Nondisplaced Fx also of right inferior pubic ramus.

4. Large distended gallbladder which contains gallstones.
Mild-to-moderate
CBD dilatation. MRCP can be obtained for further evaluation.

5. Large hiatal hernia.

6. Bilateral atrophic kidneys.

CTA Chest & Pancreas [**2188-12-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Distended gallbladder with gallstone and mild surrounding
stranding. No
wall thickening. Acute cholecystitis could be considered
according to
clinical symptoms.
2. No pulmonary embolism.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, right larger than left,
associated with
bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Enlarged pulmonary arteries which are suggestive of pulmonary

hypertension.
5. Large hiatal hernia containing stomach and small bowel.
6. Dilated common bile duct measuring 15 mm.
7. 10-mm metallic density is seen in bowel loops that could
represent a
foreign body.
8. Anasarca.
9. Low-attenuation lesion/structure can be identified in the
inferior images
and could represent bowel loop or fluid pocket or cyst.

ECHO
Conclusions
EF>55%
The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There
is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

No intracavitary ventricular thrombus seen. Intra-atrial
thrombus cannot be adequately assessed by transthoracic
echocardiography.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-1-22**].
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher and
tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent. Right ventricular
chamber size is now larger.




Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted initially admitted to the medical service where
an Orthopedics consult was placed given her left hip fracture.
She was noted with an elevated INR to 4.5 (was on Coumadin at
home for atrial fibrillation) and was given Vitamin K for
reversal upon admission. A little over 24 hours from admission
it was noted upon exam that there was an expanding left groin
mass concerning for retroperitoneal bleed with an INR of 4.7 and
4.3. She was taken to Interventional Radiology for Gelfoam
embolization for active pelvic extravasation arising from branch
of left external pudendal artery. She was taken back to IR the
following day to assess for further bleeding and no new areas of
extravasation were noted. Her Coumadin was withheld (last INR
1.2 on [**12-12**]). She was returned to the SICU post procedure.

She was taken to the operating room on [**12-7**] for repair of her
left hip fracture; her INR on day of surgery was 1.3.
Postoperatively she was taken back to the ICU where she remained
for close monitoring and respiratory care. She did have high
oxygen requirements initially felt likley due to her fluid
status and cardiac history. A CTA of her chest was done to rule
out pulmonary embolus, none was identified. Her oxygen was
weaned but she does still require intermittent nasal cannula.

It was noted on abdominal CT imaging that she had a very large
hiatal hernia containing stomach and small bowel. She underwent
ultrasound of her gallbladder which did show CBD 10mm, +gall
stones with intrahepatic duct dilation. There were discussion
which took place as to whether she would require surgical
intervention because of the size of the hiatal hernia and
concern for it causing her symptoms. The decision to hold on
surgery was made after discussions with patient and family.

It was discussed with her Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] whether to
restart her Coumadin; he would like for her to go back on her
Coumadin as she is very high risk for embolic process given her
history of stroke secondary to her atrial fibrillation. He
suggested [**Last Name (un) 2557**] Lovenox as a bridge until her goal INR of [**2-17**]
is reached. She will be ordered for Coumadin 4.5 mg to be given
tonight; her home regimen was ordered.

She would eventually be transferred the regular nursing unit;
she continued to work with Physical therapy which had been
initiated in the ICU. Recommendations for an LTAC after her
acute hospital stay were made. Case management initiated the
screening process.
