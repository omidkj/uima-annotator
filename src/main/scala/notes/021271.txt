Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement [**2119-6-29**]

History of Present Illness:
69 yo F w/ history of CAD and DM who presents with acute onset
of shortness of breath this morning.  She felt well when she
first got out of bed, but felt acutely dyspneic after getting up
from breakfast.  She tried to leave the house but was out of
breath getting into her car.  She had no cough, chest pain,
diaphoresis or calf pain.  She has had no recent travel,
surgeries or trauma, though her physical activity has been very
limited by chronic back and left hip pain.  She had superficial
thrombophlebitis during her three pregnancies but has never had
any other abnormal clotting.

Initial ED vital signs 98.3, 97, 122/68, 18 and 95RA.   ED exam
notable for mild tachycardia, guaiac negative.  Initial labs
concerning for elevated DDimer > 1063 and mild anemia Hct 34.7.
EKG with sinus tachycardia, RBBB but no e/o RV strain.  Obtained
CTA that revealed large thrombus in right main pulmonary artery.
 Given Dilaudid 1mg IV, Plavix 600mg PO (for initial presumed
ACS), Heparin bolus & gtt and Integrillin bolus (did not
continue on gtt).  Has gotten approximately 1L fluid in IV
medications.  No Echo performed while in ED.

Of note, patient recently saw Rheumatology for evaluation of a
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 9374**] [**Doctor First Name **].  Initial labs revealed normal CBC, ESR, CRP and
negative [**Doctor First Name **], anti-Sm, RNP, RO and LA.  She was also recently
told that she has iron deficiency anemia and should start taking
iron.

She has had chronic stable angina for over a decade that has not
been an issue for the last 3 months, partly due to decreased
activity.  She has chronic back and left hip pain that restricts
her movements.  Her right ankle occasionally swells, and was
swollen yesterday.  On review of systems, she denies any prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2119-6-28**]
1:44 PM
1. Large pulmonary embolus in the right main pulmonary artery
extending into the lobar branches. No evidence of right heart
strain or pulmonary infarct.
2. Fatty liver.
3. Prominent anterior mediastinal nodes not meeting CT criteria
for
pathologic enlargement; however, recommend CT followup in six
months to ensure stability.

LENIs ([**2119-6-29**])
1. No evidence of acute DVT.
2. Chronic thrombus within the greater saphenous vein on the
right from the mid thigh to the calf. This has improved from
prior.

Abd/Pelvis CT non-contrast ([**2119-7-1**]):
1. Large right proximal/medial thigh hematoma, located in the
adductor
compartment. No intra-abdominal retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Degenerative change in lumbar spine. Superior endplate
depression at L2
which is unchanged from prior MRI.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2119-6-29**] at 11:06:09 AM      FINAL
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with focal basal free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2117-6-7**], the right ventricle is more dilated with basal
hypokinesis and evidence of volume overload. The left
ventricular function is similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
# PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Patient w/ acute onset shortness of
breath, CTA showed large amount of clot in the right main
pulmonary artery extending into the lobar branches. Patient was
hemodynamically stable and was oxygenating well on nasal
cannula. She was started heparin gtt to maintain PTT between 60
and 10
