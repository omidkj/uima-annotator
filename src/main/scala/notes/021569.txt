Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5141**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PleurX abdominal catheter placement [**2175-9-14**]


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 83 year-old [**Location 7979**] speaking female with a
history of recently diagnosed gastric adenocarcinoma with mets
to the peritoneum, recurrent abdominal ascites, atrial flutter,
who presented [**9-11**] for elective pleurex catheter placement into
the peritoneum.  Her ascites was drained 5 days prior to
admission, and since that procedure, she has had increasing poor
appetite and fluid intake.  In the intake suite, she was found
to be tachycardic to 160s. At that time, she was completely
asymptomatic without chest pain, palpitations, and had only mild
shortness of breath comparable to her baseline.  She was taken
to the ER for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: HR 161 134/71 20 100% 4L. ECG showed
atrial flutter at 154. Patient was given 2L NS, HR remained in
150s. She was given 15 mg IV diltiazem with initial improvement
of HR into 80s, then resturned to 100s. placed on a diltiazem
drip. She was then given 30 mg PO diltiazem, another 15 IV dilt,
then started on diltiazem drip at 10 cc/hr, still in atrial
flutter. CTA showed bilateral PE, no RV strain. After discussion
with the family, decision was made to start a heaprin drip and
she was transferred to the ICU for rate control.  In the ICU,
after initial attempt to transition to oral diltiazem was
unsuccessful, a second attempt was effective, and she was able
to be transferred to the floor without any incident.  At that
time, she felt well and was stable.  Of note, after discussion
with the patient and her family about the risks and benefits of
anticoagulation for PEs including need for blood tets for
monitoring, they elected to not pursue anticoagulation therapy.

REPORTS
EKG [**2175-9-11**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response, although there is some organized atrial activity. The
variable ventricular response suggests atrial fibrillation
(atrial flutter). No significant change compared to the previous
tracing except that the current ventricular response is more
variable suggesting the combination of atrial fibrillation and
flutter.

EKG [**2175-9-11**]: The rate is much slower with persistent
flutter/fibrillation waves with a regular ventricular response
suggesting conducted atrial fibrillation.

CXR [**2175-9-11**]: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis and small
bilateral pleural effusions. Stable cardiomegaly.

CTA Chest [**2175-9-11**]: IMPRESSION: Pulmonary emboli involving the
right middle and lower lobar as well as left lower lobar
pulmonary arteries without evidence of right heart strain. Small
bilateral simple pleural effusions are slightly increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old female with end stage gastric adenocarcinoma with
metastases to peritpneum and a history of atrial flutter
requesting comfort measures only who presents with atrial
flutter and PE prior to placement of PleurX abdominal catheter.

ACTIVE ISSUES

1. Atrial Flutter: Patient presented with palpitations and HR
>150 prior to placement of adbominal catheterization. Because
she was symptomatic from her atrial flutter, it was deemed
reasonable to rate control her. Patient initially controlled
with IV diltiazem drip and transitioned to 90mg diltiazem qid.
Rate was controlled to the 70's-100's with one asymptomatic runs
back to 150. Patient was discharged on 360mg diltiazem ER. No
anticoagulation prophylaxis on discharge as per patient's goals
of care.
.
2. PE: Bilateral PE was visualized on CTA, likely precipitated
in setting of end-stage malignancy. There was no evidence of
hemodynamic compromise or RV strain. Patient was briefly started
in heparin drip. However, discussed with patient and her family
that treatment of a PE consists of heparin and 3-6 months of
coumadin or lovenox shots. Also explained that because of her
cancer, she has a high risk of developing more clots even while
on coumadin. Thus, because coumadin requires frequent blood
draws and carries a risk of bleed, this would not be consistent
with her goals of care. Heparin drip was discontinued on
transfer to floor
.
3. Recurrent ascites: Likely secondary to malignancy. Patient
underwent PleurX abdominal catheter placement [**2175-9-14**] for
palliation.
.
4. Stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma. No further treatment under
current goals of care.
