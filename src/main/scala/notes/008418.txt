History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 57041**] is a 25 year old male with recurrent endocarditis.
Back in [**2137**], he underwent Bentall procedure utilizing homograft
along with VSD closure and debridement of aortic root abscess.
Unfortunately due to recurrent IVDA, he developed recurrent
endocarditis. Blood cultures were positive for MSSA. Following a
prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics and period of being
drug free/drug rehab, he presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical
intervention. His last heroin abuse was back in [**2139-10-9**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2140-3-7**] Admit chest x-ray: Diffuse enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette consistent with cardiomegaly and/or pericardial
effusion. This appears to have increased since the prior
examination. The lungs remain clear with no evidence of acute
infiltrate, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
[**2140-3-8**] Brain MRA: No enhancing lesions. Encephalomalacia of the
right parietal lobe from a prior infarct. Minimal chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. No acute infarct or evidence of
mycotic aneurysm.
[**2140-3-10**] Cardiac Catheterization: Selective coronary angiography
of this right dominant system demonstrated no significant
epicardial CAD.  The LMCA, LAD, LCX, RCA and their branches had
no angiographically apparent disease. Resting hemodynamics
revealed systemic arterial central normotension. Supraaortic
aortography revealed severe AI.

CHEST (PA & LAT)[**2140-3-16**]
Reason: evaluate pleural effusions
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
25 year old man s/p avr, asc ao replacement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate pleural effusions
STUDY: PA and lateral chest, [**2140-3-19**].
HISTORY: 25-year-old man status post aortic valve replacement.
Evaluate pleural effusions.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous study from [**3-19**], [**2140**] and [**2140-3-5**].
The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged but stable since the
previous studies. Median sternotomy wires are identified. There
is some streaky density seen at the left mid lung field
consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. There is blunting of
the left costophrenic angle consistent with a small pleural
effusion. Embolization coils are seen within the right upper
quadrant.
Impression:
Cardiomegaly with likely a small left-sided pleural effusion.

INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA  and extending into the RV. PFO is present.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D  images. Severely dilated LV cavity. Severe
global LV hypokinesis. Severely depressed LVEF.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior  - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal
- hypo; mid anteroseptal -  hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid

Conclusions:
PRE CPB A patent foramen ovale is present. The left ventricular
cavity is
severely dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined.
Patient is s/p aortic homograft placement in past. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. . Motion of the aortic
leaflets is abnormal. An aortic valve vegetation/mass cannot be
excluded. An aortic annular abscess is seen. The largest abscess
cavity is located along the non-coronary cusp. Flow is seen into
this cavity. There are other echolucencies consistent with
perivalvular abscess seen nera both coronary artery takeoffs.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST CPB The patient is receiving infusions of milrinone,
dobutamine, and
norepinephrine. LV systolic function remains severely globally
depressed.
However, the inferior wall appears to be worse. The EF is
perhaps 20%. RV
systolic function is somewhat improved from the pre-CPB study.
There is still at least moderate if not moderate to severe
global hy
