Pertinent Results:
OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY ([**2130-8-22**]): Gall bladder, cholecystectomy:
adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with associated high-grade
dysplasia.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2130-8-25**]): No DVT in both
lower extremities.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2130-8-25**]): Enlargement of the peripheral
consolidative abnormality at the left lung base since [**8-24**] is consistent with increasing infection or infarction.  These
diagnostic possibilities were discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 151**] the
physician caring for this patient at approximately 11:30 this
morning.  Mild edema persists at the base of the right lung.
Heart size is normal.

V/Q SCAN ([**2130-8-25**]): Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary
embolism. Matched defects in both lung relate to COPD.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2130-8-28**]): Left lower lobe opacification with
associated pleural effusion, consistent with pneumonia in the
appropriate clinical setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment. On [**2130-8-22**], the patient underwent an
open cholecystectomy, which went well without complication
(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). The patient
was given an epidural for pain control, which controlled her
pain well. However, in the PACU, the patient required a
transient phenylephrine drip, 2 L fluid bolus, and one dose of
albumin due to a systolic blood pressure in the 70s, while
mentating well and being entirely asymptomatic. Of note, the
patient had taken her HTN medications that morning. With
adjustment of the epidural parameters, the patient was easily
weaned off the phenylephrine, with stable blood pressures in the
90-100s. Thereafter, she was trasnferred to the general surgical
floor with a foley catheter, NPO, on IVF, with a foley catheter
and JP drain.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

General Brief Hospital Course:

Neuro: The patient orgiginally received an epidural on POD1,
however, it did not control her pain, the epidural was split and
then discontinued on POD2 at which point the patient was
transistioned to oral pain medication with IV breakthrough.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was successfully
transitioned to oral pain medications, and had good pain control
thereafter.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint
after transfer from the PACU to the floor; vital signs were
routinely monitored.  Of note an a-line was placed briefly while
the patient was in the ICU to monitor hemodynamics.  a-line was
discontinued on POD4 as patients hemodynamics remained stable
throughout the rest of her hospital stay.

Pulmonary: On POD2 patient has an episode of desaturation to the
mid 70's which was transient and imporved with IS usage and O2
per nasal cannula.  Patient experienced another episode of
desaturation to the 70's which also responded to supplemental
oxygen however, this episode was associated with a change in
mental status.  Pateint was hemodynamicaly stable, O2 saturation
remained above 90 with supplemental oxygen and UOP was
sufficient.  WBC was however elevated at 18 and the decision was
made to transfer the patient to the ICU for a further w/u of
altered mental status.  Blood gases were followed closely and
the patient was continued on supplemental oxygen.  ABGs remained
consistent with a picture of chronic COPD.  While in the ICU
patient remaine stable from a cardiovascular standpoint,
however, she continued to have episoded of altered mental status
especially in the evening. Workup (please refer to Pertinent
Results section) proved negative for pulmonary embolism. Imaging
and clinical correlation was suggestive of pneumonia, and the
patient was treated accordingly (please refer to ID section
below).

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Once
appropriate bowel function was seen to return, the patient was
transitioned to clear liquids, then full liquids, and finally a
regular diet. She tolerated all these steps well.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection throughout her stay. As
discussed above, the identification of pneumonia prompted
requesting the input of Infectious Disease specialists. Per
their recommendations, the patient was started on IV vancomycin,
cefepime, and flagyl. The vancomycin was discontinued after 2
days, while cefepime and flagyl were continued through till
discharge. Please note that per recommendations, the patient was
discharged with prescriptions, and clear instructions to take
THREE (3) DAYS of antibiotics after discharge as follows:
Cefpodoxime 400 mg PO q12H, and Flagyl 500 mg PO q8H.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verb
