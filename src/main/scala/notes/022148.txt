Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Shunt discontinuity


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2150-5-9**]: Attempted VP shunt revision complicated by
intraoperative finding of possible chest wall abcess, VP shunt
externalization in the OR by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**2150-5-11**]: VP shunt explanted, Right EVD implanted
[**2150-5-20**]: Left sided VP shunt


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 34 year old
right handed woman with a history of congenital hydrocephalus
s/p
VPS placement right after birth s/p revision at age 13. She also
appears to have baseline mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

She states having developed erythema over her R chest wall about
a week ago. Earlier today she noted a drastic increase in the
size of the protrusion over her chest wall as well as redness so
came to the [**Hospital3 **] ED and was subsequently transferred to
the
ED here. CXR done at OSH showed calcified fibrous tissue
surrounding the shunt and two focal areas of shunt discontinuity
at right lower neck.

She denies any headache or blurred vision. No nausea except at
the [**Hospital3 **] ED where she vomited once. No fevers.



Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes
2. chronic UTI/neurogenic bladder requiring cath
3. asthma

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2150-5-8**] 8:29 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Hydrocephalus, raising the possibility of shunt malfunction,
however,
prior studies are not available for direct comparison.
2. Absent septum pellucidum with lack of visualization of the
corpus
callosum, which may be attenuated or there may be possible
agenesis. If
further delineation is desired, MR could be performed.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2150-5-8**] 9:10 PM PA AND LATERAL
VIEWS OF THE CHEST: A VP shunt catheter is noted coursing along
the right neck and right anterior chest, however there are
multiple areas of apparent discontinuity within the catheter as
it courses within the neck. There are low lung volumes. The
heart size is top normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
unremarkable. The lungs are clear and the pulmonary vascularity
is normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.Bilateral
[**Location (un) 931**] rods are in place.

IMPRESSION: Discontinuity of the VP shunt catheter within the
right neck.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2150-5-9**] 2:25 PM FRONTAL CHEST
RADIOGRAPH: Retained shunt tubing is noted extending from the
level of the right fifth posterior rib inferiorly. [**Location (un) 931**]
rods are noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The
lungs are grossly clear.  There is no pneumothorax or focal
consolidation.
IMPRESSION:
1. Retained shunt tubing.
2. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2150-5-9**] 4:04 PM IMPRESSION:

1. Discontinuity of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which is not
see above
the level of T3.
2. Area of phlegmonous changes around superior most aspect of
the VP shunt
and extending cephalad. No drainable fluid collection.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Multiple subcentimeter simple
