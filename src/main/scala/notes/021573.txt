[**2112-8-30**]:  EKG:

Atrial fibrillation. Marked left axis deviation with Q waves in
leads I, aVL of uncertain significance. Right bundle-branch
block. Possible left anterior fascicular block. ST-T wave
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**2112-8-30**]: Left forearm x-ray:

IMPRESSION: Displaced and angulated fractures of the mid shaft
of the radius, and distal third diaphysis of the ulna as
described above. Views of the left wrist and elbow are grossly
unremarkable, however, if there are symptoms referable to these
regions, dedicated views of these areas are recommended.

[**2112-8-30**]: x-ray of the pelvis:


AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS: Evaluation for fracture is slightly
limited by diffuse demineralization. No acute fracture or
dislocation is visualized. Pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints
are not diastatic. Mild-to-moderate joint space narrowing is
seen within the hips. There are degenerative changes noted
within the imaged lower lumbar spine with intervertebral disc
space narrowing, endplate sclerosis and osteophyte formation.
Evaluation of the sacrum is grossly intact, but is limited due
to overlying bowel gas. Several calcified phleboliths are noted
within the pelvis. Vascular calcifications are also present

[**2112-8-30**]:  cat scan of the c-spine:

IMPRESSION:
1. Minimally displaced fracture of the right lateral mass of C1
with small
amount of soft tissue swelling anterior to C1.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes including pannus extending
into the central canal at C1/2, and mild central canal narrowing
at C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7.

[**2112-8-30**]:  cat scan of the head:


IMPRESSION:
1. Interval progression of left subdural hematoma with new shift
of midline structures to the right.
2. Interval progression of parafalcine subdural blood and new
focus of
subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right Sylvian fissue.
3. Soft tissue hematomas as noted above.

[**2112-8-31**]:  Lumbar/sacral spine films:

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderately severe multilevel degenerative changes.

2. Compression fracture of L1 (~ 20% loss of height), with grade
1
retrolisthesis and scoliosis at L1-2. The degree of compression
at L1 is
similar to a [**2111-11-30**] chest x-ray.

3. Mild wedging of two mid thoracic and one lower thoracic
vertebral body.

4. Increased interstitial markings in the lungs, right greater
than left,
similar to a chest x-ray dated [**2111-11-30**], at which time it was
thought to
represent CHF

[**2112-9-1**]:  cat scan of the head:

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable left subdural hematoma with unchanged associated
rightward shift of midline structures.
2. Stable parafalcine and supratentorial subdural hematomas.
3. Stable soft tissue hematoma overlying the left zygomatic arch
and small
frontal scalp subgaleal hematoma.
4. Right C1 lateral mass fracture, partially imaged.

[**2112-9-2**]:  fluroscopy left arm:

For a total fluoroscopic time of 8.8 seconds there are 7 total
fluoroscopic spot films and technical parameters with changes of
a plate and screw ORIF involving previously seen left radius and
ulna fractures with now near normal anatomic alignment. Please
refer to operative report for further detail.

[**2112-9-4**]:  cat scan of the head:

 IMPRESSION:
1. Stable 10-mm left hemispheric subdural hematoma. No new
intracranial
hemorrhage.
2. Stable left parafalcine subdural hematomas.
3. Stable 4-mm rightward shift of midline structures.

[**2112-9-5**]:  chest x-ray:

 FINDINGS: Lung volumes remain low. Cardiac silhouette is likely
mildly
enlarged and is similar compared to prior study. Persistent
pulmonary
vascular congestion. Asymmetrical airspace opacities
predominantly involving the right lung could reflect
asymmetrical edema or secondary process such as aspiration or
evolving infectious pneumonia. Repeat study with PA and lateral
technique with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for
more complete assessment when the patient's condition allows.

[**2112-9-6**]:  chest x-ray:

 IMPRESSION: Since [**2112-9-5**], worsening of the
asymmetric (right more than left) opacities is concerning for
pneumonia with concomitant mild pulmonary edema

[**2112-9-7**]:  x-ray right sided PICC line:

IMPRESSION: The right-sided PICC terminating about 3 cm from the
aortocaval junction
