HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old woman
with COPD on chronic p.o.steroids, CHF, CAD, diabetes type 2,
transferred from the outside hospital MICU for further
treatment of C.difficile colitis.  The patient was initially
admitted for shortness of breath, COPD flare and found to
have left lower lobe pneumonia treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics.  The patient was discontinued to rehabilitation,
but then bounced back with shortness of breath.  One week
prior to transfer, the patient began to have abdominal pain
and diarrhea, increasing distention.  CT scan showed
pancolitis.  Stool culture at that time was felt to be
positive C.difficile reportedly, but later found out that
this had not been done.  The patient was started on p.o.
Flagyl.  Over the weekend the patient was felt to have
worsening abdominal examination.  Surgical consultation felt
that she had increased risk and declined intervention.  Also,
notable for cardiac enzymes leaks, treated with aspirin, beta
blocker, and Lovenox.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further evaluation and
management.  Upon arrival, vital signs were stable.  The
patient was in obvious discomfort.  The patient had
complaints of diffuse body pain.

clear without lymphadenopathy.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Cor:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
PULMONARY:  No wheeze, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Obese, tender to palpation diffusely, tympanetic,
diffusely ecchymotic.  RECTAL:  Guaiac negative.  Formed
stool in vault.  EXTREMITIES:  There was 1+ pitting edema
bilaterally of extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count 7, hematocrit 35.2, platelet count 239,000,
sodium 134, potassium 3.4, chloride 99, bicarbonate 27, BUN
14, creatinine 0.2, glucose 168, calcium 6.4, ionized .97,
phosphorus 1.8, magnesium 1.6, ABG 7.42, 44, 71, ALT 24, AST
20, alkaline phosphatase 78, amylase 4, lipase 7, total
bilirubin .3, albumin 1.9.  Outside data, [**6-22**] sputum 3+
[**Female First Name (un) 564**], 2 normal flora; [**6-17**], 3+ Actineobacter.

IMAGING:  [**7-6**] CT of the abdomen at outside hospital revealed
diffuse thickening of the colonic wall consistent with
pseudomembranous colitis, relative opacity in the upper pole
of the left kidney question tumors; [**7-4**] KUB prominent
markings, increased gas, question colitis; [**7-2**] chest CT
revealed bilateral upper lobe emphysema with bullous changes,
no pneumonia or effusion, lingular infiltrate.

Chest x-ray on admission:  Consolidation of both lower lobes,
which may be consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.

ABDOMEN:  Not included.  Gases present through slightly
dilated colon, but no evidence of toxic megacolon.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU. CT
scan on the following day showed atelectasis, right lung
base, free fluid in the abdomen, surrounding liver and
spleen, fluid within the right lateral soft tissues measuring
than 10 haustral units and not felt consistent with
hemorrhage.  Distention of large bowel without
intra-abdominal air.  No air within the bowel wall.  There
was concern about the fluid tracking into the soft tissue.
It was attempted to be aspirated under ultrasound guidance
and 2 cc of fluid were aspirated, but no large fluid
collection.  That fluid was gram-stain negative and,
therefore, grew.  The patient was made NPO, IV fluids,
started on p.o. Vancomycin and Flagyl.  KUBs were followed
serially throughout the ICU course.  The Gastrointestinal
Department was consulted.  The Department of Surgery was also
consulted, followed and felt that the patient did not need
surgical intervention at that time.  The Flagyl was then
changed to IV.  Rectal tube and frequent turning were
initiated, however, the patient had no stool output.  The
patient was started on TPN for nutrition.  From a pulmonary
standpoint, nebs and MDI were continued.  Prednisone was
being tapered.  The patient had transient hyponatremia to
129, thought secondary to quick mix and not resolved.  Few
episodes of decreased urine output, which was treated with IV
fluids and resolved on [**7-12**].  The patient was noted to have
nine bands up from three on [**7-11**] and down from 41 on admission
on [**7-8**].  On [**7-13**], the patient was felt stable for transfer to
the medical floor.  On that day it was noted that the left
upper extremity was larger than the right and there was
concern for clot.  Ultrasound was done, which was negative
for DVT.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by system)

GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient's abdominal examination was
followed serially.  Gastrointestinal Department and Surgery
Department continued to follow the patient.  KUBs were done
serially to assess the amount of distention.

On [**7-14**] CT of the abdomen was repeated, which showed no
evidence of abscess formation or microperforation.  There was
no interval change in the colonic distention or mild
thickening in the sigmoid.  There was a slight interval
increase in the dilatation of the small bowel loops with
multiple air-fluid levels consistent with ileus.  Stable
amount of free fluid.  Interval increase in regional
interstitial nodular opacification of the left lower lobe
which might have been a developing pneumonia.  Given the
patient's discomfort nasogastric tube was placed and a large
amount bilious fluid was returned.  The NG tube was continued
for decompression.  The patient was followed by the
Gastrointestinal Department and Surgery Department.  The
Gastrointestinal Department was considering doing a flexible
sigmoidoscopy given that we had no diagnosis.  All C.
difficile cultures sent were negative and there were no
outside cultures that were positive.  The patient had several
lactates done for concern of ischemic bowel, however,
lactates were all within normal range.  On the day of planned
sigmoidoscopy on [**7-17**], the patient required transferred to
the ICU.  Please see below.  Therefore, it was deferred.
During the ICU stay the abdominal examination slowly improved
and the Department of Surgery signed off.

The patient completed a full course of Flagyl and Vancomycin
for presumed C. difficile colitis.  She was started on clears
and she was tolerating clears.  Diet was slowly advanced.  On
[**7-24**] flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed.  This showed
ulceration, granularity, and friability, erythema and
pseudomembranes in the colon concerning for C-difficile
colitis versus ischemic colitis, biopsy taken, sent stat and
pending at this time.  The patient was also continued on
Protonix.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient completed a full course of
Flagyl and Vancomycin for presumed C. difficile colitis.  The
patient remained afebrile throughout the hospitalization,
however, this was felt possibly related her steroids and that
she was immunocompromised.

White count was monitored and it was noted that the patient
was having increasing bandemia.  ON [**7-14**] blood cultures were
drawn and these were found to be positive for Staph coagulase
negative.  The Infectious Disease Department was also
consulted and followed the patient.  She was treated with IV
Vancomycin for this.  Catheter tip from the central line was
culture.  The central line w
