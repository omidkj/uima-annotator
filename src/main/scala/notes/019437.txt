Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
two day history of falls and dysarthria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32675**] is a 64 year-old right-handed woman with a past
medical history including hepatitis C, pulmonary hypertension,
and chornic thrombocytopenia who initially presented to
[**Hospital1 **]
with a two day history of falls and dysarthria and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when she was found to have a right
basal
ganglia hemorrhage in the setting of a platelet count of 43.
.
The patient explains that she last felt well on Friday, two days
prior to admission.  One day prior to admission she started
falling; she thinks that she generally fell toward the left.
Although there was no loss of consciousness, she did strike her
head during at least one of the spills.  She also started to
drop
items from her left hand.   On the evening prior to admission,
she reportedly sent her friend a non-sensical email with letters
strung together in non- English words.  On the day of admission,
the patient's friend called her to see how she was faring and
discovered the patient's speech was slurred.  Accordingly, the
friend called 911.  The patient was initially taken to
[**Hospital1 **].
After a non-contrast CT of the head demonstrated right basal
ganglia hemorrhage, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and care.

Pertinent Results:
MR head [**2200-7-21**]

. Large acute-subacute intraparenchymal hematoma in the right
basal ganglia with surrounding edema and mild leftward shift of
the midline structures and mass effect on the right lateral
ventricle, not significantly changed compared to the recent CT
study. Small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left
parietal lobe, corresponding to the previously noted hemorrhage
on the CT.


2. 5 x 5 mm saccular, lobulated aneurysm in the region of the
confluence of the A1 and A2 segment sof the right anterior
cerebral artery and the anterior communicating artery. However,
it is unclear if this has ruptured given the farther location of
the hematoma. hence, any other aneurysms or vascular lesions
cannot be completely excluded. Consider CT angiogram of the head
for better assessment of this aneurysm and any other
anuerysms/vascular lesions elsewhere and in the hematoma. Rec.
INR consult. Post-contrast MR images can be considered after
resolution of the hemorrhage to exclude an underlying mass
lesion. Findings informed to [**Doctor Last Name **] by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2200-7-22**].

3. Diffuse mucosal thickening/fluid in the left mastoid air
cells.

I7/26/10 US abd.
MPRESSION:
  1. Chronic appearing nonocclusive thrombus involving the
distal splenic
vein/SMV confluence with regions of presumed chronic occlusion
involving
portions of the main portal vein which is diminutive in size.
Some
intrahepatic right portal flow is noted which may relate to
arterial portal shunting or portal collateral vessel formation.
Hepatic veins and arteries remain patent.

2. Mild splenomegaly. Coarsened heterogeneous liver parenchyma
is presumably secondary to hepatitis C.

TTE [**2200-7-21**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
