Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year-old woman with a history of obesity,
sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and
COPD (On home O2 with baseline sat 92-94%) who presented with a
headache and mild shortness of breath and was found to be
markedly hypoxic. Her hospital course briefly:
.
1. Hypoxia. This was felt secondary to a heart failure
exacerbation secondary to non-compliance with medication (she
avoids taking Lasix when she goes out) and with BiPAP (the
machine she has now makes too much noise). She was initially
admitted to the MICU. There she received aggressive diuresis
with IV Lasix. She improved back to her baseline within two
days. She was transferred to the floor and then discharged with
her home O2. She noted that she intended to ask her
pulmonologist about a new BiPAP machine.
.
2. Headache. This resolved spontaneously and was not further
evaluated.
