Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, status post one vessel CABG in [**2147**], status
post MI in [**2149**], status post aortic valve replacement, with
atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion times three,
CHF with ejection fraction of 55%, who presented to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for elective cardioversion.
The patient had a recent admission in [**2153-10-8**] for
CHF and atrial fibrillation.  At that time, she was started
on anticoagulation with Coumadin and Amiodarone.  The patient
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for admission in [**2153-11-7**] for left
facial droop and slurred speech with evaluation significant
for a negative head CT and carotid Dopplers.  The patient was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] and returns today for
elective cardioversion.

On arrival to the [**Hospital6 256**], she
was noted to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in
the 80s and a heart rate in the 70s, in atrial fibrillation.
She was asymptomatic at the time.  She received 150 cc of
normal saline with an increase in her systolic blood pressure
to the 90s.  Oxygen saturation was 80% on room air and 100%
on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Her DC cardioversion was
uneventful and she returned to sinus rhythm.  Currently, the
patient denied any lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, diaphoresis, or
radiating pain.  She has no recent fevers, chills, or night
sweats.  No abdominal pain, no cough.  She does note pain at
the site of her sternotomy which has been ongoing for three
or more years.  There is an erythematous area that she notes
is improving in the last three to four months.

CT Surgery evaluated the patient in the holding area of the
Catheterization Laboratory and recommended sternal wire
revision.  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology Floor
for monitoring due to her postprocedure hypotension and for
heparinization while her INR came down so that she could have
sternal wire revision procedure on Monday with a normal INR.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion times
three.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post MI, status post one
vessel CABG in [**2147**].
3.  Status post aortic valve replacement.
4.  Status post pacemaker in [**2151-8-8**].
5.  Status post bilateral breast cancer, status post right
lumpectomy and XRT in [**2139**] and radical left mastectomy in
[**2146**].
6.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 55%
on an echocardiogram in [**2153-10-8**].
7.  Hypertension.
8.  TIA.
9.  Status post TAH/BSO.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 2.5 mg q.d.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
4.  Lasix 60 mg q.d.
5.  Atenolol 50 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is widowed and lives at the
Alzheimer's Home.  She denied any alcohol use and states that
she quit smoking at the age of 50.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for ovarian cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile
with a pulse of 68, blood pressure 96/40, respirations 18,
oxygen saturation 100% on 2 liters.  General:  She was a
frail-appearing female in no acute distress responding to all
questions appropriately.  The examination was significant for
a dry oropharynx, JVP at 8-9 cm with prominent EJ pulsations,
rales in the lungs present a third of the way up the left
lung field posteriorly with decreased breath sounds in the
right lung field a third of the way up posteriorly.  No
dullness to percussion.  Moderate air movement.  Heart:
Regular with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur heard at the
left upper sternal border.  Abdomen:  Benign.  Extremities:
Warm with 2+ pitting edema bilaterally from the feet to the
knees.  Skin:  Notable for prominent sternotomy wires and an
area of erythema and warmth over the third sternal wire and
extreme tenderness to touch over all sternotomy wires.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Significant for a hematocrit of
42, platelets 172,000 and an INR of 1.9.

EKG showed atrial pacer spikes and a rate of 69 beats per
minute with left bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service.

1.  STERNOTOMY SITE INFLAMMATION:  The CT Surgery Service was
consulted and felt that the sternotomy site inflammation was
not due to infection but was due to erosion of the skin over
the wire.  They were not able to see the patient on Monday
and, therefore, suggested arranging an outpatient appointment
for her at a further date.  It was, therefore, decided that
the patient would go home on her Coumadin and remain on
Coumadin for three weeks in order to prevent increased stroke
risk during the three weeks after cardioversion and will
follow-up with CT Surgery for sternotomy wire revision at a
later time once she is no longer in the window of increased
stroke risk after cardioversion.  The patient was, therefore,
discontinued from her heparin and restarted on her Coumadin
doses.

2.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient remained in sinus
rhythm with rates between 68 and 100 beats per minute with no
events other than one run of three minutes of ventricular
tachycardia which was asymptomatic.  Other than that,
telemetry was uneventful.  The patient was continued on her
Coumadin with a goal INR of [**3-11**].5.

3.  HYPOXIA:  After diuresis with Lasix and Diuril, the
patient's oxygen saturation improved.  She was continued on
diuresis.

4.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was continued on
her aspirin, beta blocker, and statin.

5.  BLOOD PRESSURE:  The patient was hypotensive
postprocedure with blood pressures as low as 70 systolic.
She received 1 liter of fluids and still appeared dry with
low blood pressures in the 80s to 90s systolic.  She was,
therefore, transfused with packed red blood cells in order to
increase her intravascular volume and minimize the fluid to
her periphery as it was deemed that she was intravascularly
depleted but total volume overloaded.

6.  LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA:  The patient was given
pressure stockings which decreased the edema in her feet;
however, there was still 2+ edema in her legs.  She was
continued on her Lasix and Zaroxolyn.

7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit decreased to 29 on
the second day of admission.  Therefore, she was transfused 2
units of packed red blood cells with Lasix in between.

DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 1761**] Center.  She will return to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] as
an outpatient in four weeks for sternal wire revision.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital3 **] Center.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Hypotension.
3.  Anemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.
5.  Warfarin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
6.  Metolazone 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in
four weeks for sternal wire revision.  Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] for
an appointment.  The patient is to stop taking her Coumadin
one week before her appointment for sternal wire revision.
The patient is to have her INR checked daily and the results
sent to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**].  The patient is to follow-up with
