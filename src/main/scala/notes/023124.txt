Admit CXR: IMPRESSION: Limited examination. A left lower lobe
infiltrate cannot be excluded. A dedicated lateral view may be
helpful. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
.

CXR [**2125-11-16**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-14**],
there is little change except for somewhat better degree of
inspiration. Bilateral pulmonary opacifications continue at the
bases, consistent with some combination of atelectasis or/and
effusion. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary
vascular congestion persists.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 89 year-old female with a history of MDS, hip
fracuture [**2-16**], living at rehab who presented with shortness of
breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis and ? R pleura
effusion/infiltrate.  Pt made comfortable with morphine/ativan
per family/pt wishes. Upon discharge to [**Hospital1 1501**], we were notified
she expired shortly upon arrival there. The following is her
course by problem.
.
# Hypoxia/Health Care Associated PNA - Patient c/o SOB and
sating only 90 on NRB so transitioned to BiPAP.  Most likely
pneumonia. Influenza negative.  Hyperviscousity syndrome
possible with polycythemia, but resolved with IVF. Patient
appeared hemoconcentrated on labs and was given IVF.  She was
started on Vanc, cefipime from ED and levoquin was added for
increased psuedomonal and atypical coverage.  Patient wean off
BiPAP breifly, but was again found to be lethargic with PCO2 in
70s.  She is noted to be quite delerious in the PM.  By day 4 in
the ICU, patient refused suctioning and many PO meds.  Per her
daughter and HCP, the patient was changed to comfort-oriented
care.  Continue Abx, but can give morphine for pain/respiratory
discomfort.  HCP is aware that this may lead to her demise, but
feel that she should be comfortable at this point. The pt will
complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin, as the family refused
midline to continue Cefepime treatment. The pt was seen by
gerontology, who made recommendations on her medications from a
palliative care perspective. For discomfort the pt will be
discharged on both standing ativan and ativan as needed (which
often helped her) as well as concentrated morphine solution
(both standing and as needed) which can be titrated up as
needed. She was satting 90% on 5L NC at discharge, mildly
dyspneic. She was given a 1 time dose of levsin and started on
scopolamine patch. Humidified shovel mask plus extra morphine
can be considered (if pt tolerates) if she becomes more
dyspneic. Pt is refusing suctioning.
.
Mental status: Mild delirium present with dementia at this time.
 [**Hospital1 3894**] is to avoid triggers.  However some triggers below are
to be used with pt's wishes.
- Avoid Foley catheters
 -try to avoid anticholinergics, and sleeping medications.
- Avoid physical restraints. They do not prevent falls or
pulling out lines. They increase aggitation. If needed, can
obtain a sitter. If pharmacologic intervention is needed, would
use low dose haldol 0.25 mg IV up to TID PRN or zyprexa 2.5 mg
x1.
- Please provide frequent reoorientation
- Minizmize disruptions to sleep wake cycle
<br>

# ARF - Cr to 1.6 with baseline of 1.0.  Unable to place foley
as met obstruction both in ED and on floor. Cr back to 0.8 on
last lab draw.
<br>

# ? Aspiration - Patient apparently aspirates while delerious at
night, but passed a swallow study.  She can take regular diet
with thin liquids under aspiration precautions.
.
# A-fib RVR - Patient went into a-fib with RVR when PO
metoprolol was stopped for risk of aspiration.  She was rate
controlled and flipped in and out of A-fib with IV doses of
metoprolol.  Eventually agreed to standing IV metoprolol.
Changed IV lopressor to po lopressor. Po lopressor can be
discontinued given goals of care/comfort measures if pt has
difficulty swallowing pills.
.
# Elevated CE - Trop elevated to 0.28, but CK normal and trend
was flat.  Likely demand ischemia in setting of pneumonia.
.
# Myeloproliferative syndrome - with baseline leukocytosis and
thrombocytosis.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Per heme/onc, no
more phlebotomy in the setting of comfort measures
.

# Goals of care: Comfort measures, no lab draws, vital signs
check daily ok per family; morphine/ativan standing and as
needed for comfort.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI
