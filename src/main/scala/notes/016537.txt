heating", but this is a frequent complaint for her.
.
In the emergency department, she had nonspecific T-wave changes
on her EKG and was given and aspiring.  She was also febrile and
hypotensive.  She received 1 liter normal saline, Levofloxacin
500 IV, Flagyl 500 IV, Hydrocort 50 IV, but remained hypotensive
(SBP 70s-80s).

is seen.

No tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. She lives alone with a caretaker
for 24 hours. She is originally from [**Country 2784**] and speaks multiple
languages fluently. She is a

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with history of atrial fibrilation who was
admitted for sepsis secondary to pneumonia.
.
1. Septic shock: In the emergency department, she was febrile
and hypotensive to 70/40.  She was given a dose of levofloxacin
and flagyl for concern of abdominal infection given her nausea
and vomiting; however, abdominal CT was negative.  She had
evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray.  Per the family's request,
a central line was not placed for invasive monitoring.  During
the first 8 hours of her ICU stay, she required 8 liters of
normal saline boluses to maintain her mean arterial pressure
above 60.  At that point, her blood pressure stabilized and she
only required one 500cc bolus during her ICU stay.  She was
maintained on levofloxacin for empiric treatment of community
acquired pneumonia.  She remained afebrile and had good urine
output.  She was transfered to the floor and continued to do
well on antibiotics.  Her urine culture showed E.coli resistant
to levofloxacin, so she was started on bactrim for her UTI.
.
2. Atrial fibrillation: In the emergency department, she was
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.  She had a
troponin of 0.03 and had non-specific T-wave changes on EKG,
which were attributed to demand ischemia in the setting of
hypotension and her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
rate.  She was started on aspirin and was ruled out for an
myocardial infarction by three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
 Once her blood pressure had stabilized, she was restarted on
her outpatient sotalol for rate control.  She was not started on
anticoagulation given her fall risk and was maintained on her
outpatient plavix for stroke prophylaxis.  During her hospital
stay, she went between a paced rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and
atrial flutter.
.
3. FEN: She had a speech and swallow evaluation that showed no
abnormalities.  She was maintained on a regular diet
supplemented by boost shakes.  Her potassium, magnesium, and
phosphorus were repleted.  She was given IV fluid boluses as
needed to maintain her blood pressure during her initial
hospital course.  Once transfered to the floor she had good PO
intake and did not need IV fluids.
.
4. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on subcutaneous heparin.
She was maintained on a PPI until she had adequate oral intake.
.
5. Access: Peripheral IV.
.
6. Code: DNR/DNI.
.
7. Communication: With her daughter and son.
