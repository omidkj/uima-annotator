.
PFTs [**8-4**]: Mechanics: The FVC is mildly to moderately reduced,
the FEV1 is moderately to severly reduced, and the FEV1/FVC
ratio is severely reduced. Flow-Volume Loop: Marked expiratory
coving and abrupt termination of exhalation with reduced volume
excursion.
Impression: The reduced FEV1/FVC ratio indicates an obstructive
ventilatory defect. The reduced FVC may reflect gas trapping
although a concurrent restrictive process cannot be ruled out.
Since [**2204-5-21**], FVC has decreased 330cc (24%) and FEV1 has
decreased 260cc (46%).
.
ECHO IMPRESSION:[**2205-5-27**] Mild focal left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved
systolic function. At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The left atrium
is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimat
