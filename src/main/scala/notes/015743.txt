Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for acute on chronic renal
failure (Cr 3.7 {baseline 2.5-3.0), K 5.5).

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis
Swan Ganz Catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo man with a h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2147**], s/p
AVR [**2147**], atrial fibrillation, DM2, CHF (EF 55%), CRI (cr
2.5-3.0), who has been at [**Hospital3 **] since a pacemaker
placement following a pacemaker placement at [**Hospital1 18**] in early
[**1-4**] who was transferred back here for acute on chronic renal
failure.

He reports that he has generally felt well since his discharge
from [**Hospital1 18**].  He does complain of exertional dyspnea which he has
had for several months and may be slightly worse now.  He
becomes dyspneic after walking for 10-15 minutes or walking up a
flight of stairs. He denies any dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, or
PND.  He also denies any CP or palpitations.  He denies any
dysuria or hematuria.  He endorses a fair appetite but feels
like he may have been drinking less the past few days at rehab.
He is unsure if he has a history of a large prostate.  He also
denies any recent fevers, chills, sweats, headache, abdominal or
back pain, or blood in his stools.

In the ED he was given one dose of kayexalate, a Foley catheter
was placed and he was admitted to medicine.

Urine:
[**1-20**] U/A:
Trace leuks, negative nitrites, 0-2 WBCs, occ bacteria.
No eosinophils.
UNa <10, FeNa <0.05%.

Microbiology:
[**1-20**] Urine culture: no growth.
[**1-21**] C. difficile: negative.

Imaging:
[**1-20**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:  No definite CHF.  Bilateral pleural effusions,
increased since [**2156-1-2**].  Continued left base
atelectasis, an underlying
consolidative process cannot be fully excluded.

[**1-20**] Renal U/S:
No hydronephrosis or obstructing renal calculi identified.
Ascites is present.

Right Heart Cath [**2155-2-6**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe biventricular volume overload.
2. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Cardiac index of 2.2 L/min/m2.

Echo [**2156-2-9**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is
elevated (>15)
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The  right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is abnormal septal  motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload.The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.A bileaflet
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. [The amount of regurgitation present
is normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification with mild
associated inflow
gradient. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic  regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2155-12-16**],
mitral inflow
gradient is now slightly lower.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old male with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2147**],
s/p AVR [**2147**], atrial fibrillation, DM2, CHF (EF 55%), CRI (cr
2.5-3.0), who has been at [**Hospital3 **] since a pacer
placement earlier this month who now presents with acute on
chronic renal failure transfer to CCU for tailoring therapy of
CHF with Swan Ganz catheter and made Confort Measures only on
[**2156-2-12**].

#Status: After discussing clinical situation with Mr [**Known lastname 34454**]
wife and PCP Dr [**Name (NI) 12167**], patient was made CMO on [**2156-2-12**]. Goal
of care was directed to confort. Patient passed away on [**2156-2-13**].
He was pronounced dead at 3:30pm.

# Pulmonary: Patient had an episode of worsening respiratory
distress, with increase pleural efussion and worsening pulmonary
infiltrates, intubated on [**2156-2-9**].
Patient extubated [**2156-2-11**].
Chest x ray on [**2156-2-12**] showed left pulmonary collapse. Given
code status of patient, no further interventions were attempted.

# Pleural effusion: Thoracentesis performed [**2155-2-9**], TP ratio
0.29, LDH ratio 0.59, LDH pleural 152 (UNL 250). Compatible with
transudade. likely secondary to CHF. Serum efussion albumine
gradient >1.2 also suggesting transudate. Gram stain negative
for bacterias,
-- CX aerobic final negative,
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure:
This was thought to be likely multifactorial.  His BUN/Cr ratio
and urine electrolytes supported a pre-renal etiology as did his
decreased po intake in the days preceding admission.  His
history of an enlarged prostate also supported an obstructive
component and he was noted to have a post-void residual of 300
at rehab.  In addition a urinalysis was somewhat suggestive of
an infectious process.  A renal ultrasound was negative for
hydronephrosis or an obstructing stone.  He was initially
treated with gentle IV hydration and a blood transfusion given
his history of CHF.  He was also started on ciprofloxacin for a
presumed urinary tract infection.  His creatinine slowly trended
down but stabilized at 3.1 initially. Patient was transfer to
the CCU for tailored therapy. A couple of days after admission
to CCU creatinine started to increase, and urine output started
to decline. His mental status started to decline. Given thios
situation a possibility of dialysis or CVVH was discussed with
renal team and also patient's wife. Ms [**Known lastname **] felt that going
into dialysis would not have been what his husband would have
wanted. This possibility was declined.

#. Cardiac:
He was initially continued on all of his cardiac medications -
metoprolol, hydralazine, isosorbide, aspirin, and atorvastatin.
His systolic blood pressure was in the 90s-100s over his first
several hospital days and his blood pressure medications were
titrated down.  He was on only metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **]-->37.5.  CCB
was held.  On [**2156-2-2**] transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for initiation of
Nesiritide therapy.  Multiple episodes of AFIB with RVR
throughout hospitalization. Initially remained hemodynamically
stable throughout.  He had a swan ganz catheter placed for
tailored therapy. Patient was transfer to CCU. Attempts were
made to optimize cardiac output but despite therapy pulmonary
edema and bilateral pleural effusions worsened associated with
