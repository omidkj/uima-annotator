Frequent dark stools, falling hematocrit

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 105363**]  is a 36 year old female with a history of an aortic
clot, retroperitoneal bleed, and duodenal ulcer bleed, who
presents with melena and anemia.
.
She presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital today with greater than
20 liquid black bm in 16 hrs. She had hgb 6, hct 18.1, vitals
99.2, hr 93, rr 16, 122/64, 98% RA. Guaiac positive times two.
.
Prior to admission to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**Hospital1 **] nursing
notes, [**2198-6-22**] at 0700 pt she was incontinent of liquid stool and
urine, hypertensive 190/90, labetalol and nitropaste prior to
dialysis. At 5pm, 3 large loose black BMs, stat hct 22.5 hgb 7,
2 units of blood given. [**6-22**] at 2300 pt continued to have black
liquid stool about 8 per shift. [**6-23**] 0800, 6 liquid black tarry
stools, given 1 unit prbcs and transferred to [**Hospital3 **].
.
She had a recent admission in [**4-30**] for the workup of altered
mental status, which was unrevealing with negative MRI/MRA head,
CT head, MRA neck, EEG.  Ultimately unclear what caused her MS
changes.  She also developed renal failure, MSSA bacteremia,
A-fib with RVR, GI bleed from duodenal ulcer, RP bleed, C. diff,
hyponatremia and aortic clot.  Briefly her previous
hospitalization was significant for the development of an aortic
occlusion for which she was started on heparin.  She then
developed RP hematoma and heparin was stopped.  She then had a
GI bleed.  Endoscopy showed ulcer with stigmata of recent bleed.
 Treated with injectible epi and BICAP.  Unfortuantely she
re-bled and as she has a potential allergy to dye and given her
aortic occlusion she was felt to be a poor candidate for IR
procedure; thus she was taken to the OR for an ex-lap and
oversewing of bleeding duodenal ulcer and 4 point ligation (on
[**5-31**]).  Her hct then improved to her baseline on 38-40.  On [**6-5**]
it dropped again to 31 from 39.  A repeat EGD on [**6-6**] showed
multiple erosions and ulcers in the duodenal bulb with bright
red blood consistent with active recent bleeding.  No
intervention was done at that time.  Her hct then trended down
slowly to 26.
.
In the ED, she was found  to have a hematocrit of 20.4 (from
26.9 on [**2198-6-20**]). She remained hemodynamically stable and without
tachycardia.  Initial vitals there were 99.1, BP 186/94, HR 98,
RR 16, Sat 98% RA.
.
On the floor, she had no new complaints. She mentioned some
non-specific abdominal cramping during her bowel movements.

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Acute on chronic anemia: differential diagnosis included acute
blood loss due to gastrointestinal bleed (with guaiac positive
stools and recent history of duodenal ulcer bleed) versus
retroperitoneal hematomas versus kidney dysfuction.  Patient
received 4 units PRBCs with inappropriate hematocrit response
early in admission.  Gastroenterology was consulted and
performed repeat EGD on [**2198-6-25**] which showed a healing duodenal
ulcer and no direct source of bleed was identified.   Patient
also had CT of the back/abdomen that did not show evidence of an
expanding hematoma, although old hematoma continued to show
signs of resolution.  She was initially on a proton pump
inhibitor drip, then transitioned to intravenous route, and
eventually to oral PPI.  Hematocrit remained stable after EGD,
with numerous guaiac negative stools noted.  Complete blood
counts should be checked daily after the patient leaves the
hospital to trend hematocrit levels, which have remained stable
at 27-30 for days prior to discharge.
.
# Chronic kidney disease: patient was initiated on hemodialysis
during her last admission to [**Hospital1 18**]. Her renal disease was
thought to be due to the large aortic thrombus.  It was noted
over the course of her admission that she was producing more
urine, and 24 hour creatinine measurement was initiated.
However, patient's creatinine uptrended while off hemodialysis,
and it was determined that patient will possibly need to
continue dialysis sessions as need at the outside facility, per
the neprologist's discretion.  Her hemo
