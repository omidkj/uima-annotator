Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old male with history HIV on HAART and
colitis who presented to the ED on [**2104-10-28**] with severe
abdominal pain for 3 days, was admitted to the surgical service
for perforated diverticulum and is now s/p sigmoid colectomy,
who represented for fever [**2104-11-7**] and was found to have
multifocal PNA and was transferred to the MICU on [**2104-11-7**] with
respiratory distress. He was intubated and underwent BAL which
was not revealing. He was treated for 14 days with linezolid,
meropenem, and cipro and was extubated [**11-21**]. His MICU course was
complicated by delirium after extubation and he developed
diarrhea (neg for c. diff), was transferred to the floor on
[**11-23**]. His status declined and he was re-admitted to the MICU on
[**11-26**] and reintubated on [**2104-11-28**]. He was extubated on [**12-1**] and
had PEG placed for nutritional support on [**12-2**]. The patient was
stable on nasal cannula and therefore was called out to the
floor in the afternoon on [**12-2**]. Vital signs prior to transfer

On arrival to the floor patient denies any pain in chest,
abdomen, extremities or elsewhere. He denies nausea or vomiting

CT torso [**2104-11-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal opacities in the upper and lower lungs, consistent
with diffuse pneumonia. New irregular gas containing cavities
concerning for necrotizing pneumonia in the previously seen area
of right lower lobe consolidation.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
3. Moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen with
indeterminate
attenuation values, likely representing post-surgical fluid. No
confined
collection within the abdomen or pelvis to suggest abscess.
4. Normal post-surgical appearance of the Hartmann's pouch and
[**Month/Day/Year 499**]. No
evidence of obstruction, perforation, or leak.

[**2104-11-8**] Echo:
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis,
however cannot exclude due to subooptimal image quality.
Moderate focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent
with inferior/inferolateral infarction. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

[**2104-11-13**] CT torso:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening alveolar pulmonary opacities with
crazy-paving pattern, which could be related to worsening
pneumonitis versus pulmonary edema and developing adult
respiratory distress syndrome. More organized and
necrotic-appearing right lower lobe necrotizing pneumonia.
Worsening pleural effusions.
2. New moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Slight interval increase in abdominal and pelvic ascites.
4. Worsening anasarca.
5. Status post sigmoid colectomy and diverting colostomy.

[**2104-12-4**] CT abdomen:
1. Interval decrease in the size of a necrotic pneumonia in the
right lung
base measuring 3.5 x 3 cm today.
2. Consolidation in the left lower lobe consistent with
aspiration or
pneumonia.
3. Left greater than right moderate nonhemorrhagic effusions.
4. Nonhemorrhagic ascitic fluid with foci of free air, likely
related to
recent PEG insertion.
