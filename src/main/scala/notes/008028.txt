History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on
[**9-22**] with generalized weakness, abdominal cramping and
diarrhea. She was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.
Further workup at [**Hospital1 **] included a TEE which revealed severe
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] TR. Cardiac catheterization was also notable for
single vessel coronary artery disease with a 70% stenosis in the
LAD. She was stabilized on medical therapy and transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical intervention. At the time of
admission, her above GI symtoms were completely resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 62747**] was admitted and remained stable on medical therapy.
Amiodarone was added to help control atrial fibrillation.  She
underwent routine preoperative evaluation which included a
stress testing and echocardiogram. The TTE on [**9-30**]
showed normal mitral valve leaflets, [**Month (only) 1192**] mitral annular
calcification and [**Month (only) 1192**] MR. There was mild LA enlargement.
Her aorta and aortic valves were normal, and the LVEF was
normal. A stress echo on [**10-1**] revealed average
functional exercise capacity. There was no ECG or 2D
echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved
workload. There was mild mitral regurgitation at rest with at
least one grade increase in mitral regurgitation severity with
exercise. Workup was also notable for an urinary tract
infection(E. coli) for which antibiotics were started. Her
preoperative course was otherwise uneventful and she was
eventually cleared for surgery.

On [**10-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a mitral valve
replacement utilizing a 25 millimeter [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine
Valve; single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending; Maze
procedure using RF ablation; and stapling of left atrial
appendage. Surgery was uneventful and she was transferred to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She successfully weaned
from intropic support. She remained mostly in a normal sinus
rhythm with first degree AV block but intermittent periods of
bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were noted on telemetry. She
otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and remained
asymptomatic. Amiodarone was continued while Warfarin
anticoagulation was initiated. On postoperative day three, she
transferred to the SDU. She continued to experience paroxsymal
atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone was tapered and beta blockade
adjusted accordingly. No further bradycardia was noted. Warfarin
was dosed daily for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0. Over the next
several days, she continued to make clinical improvements and
progressed well with physical therapy. She responded well to
diuresis. By discharge, she was near her preoperative weight
with room air saturations of 96%. The rest of her hospital
course was uncomplicated, and she was cleared for discharge to
home(with services) on postoperative day six. Her local PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 61691**] will monitor her Warfarin dosing as an outpatient. A
blood draw is scheduled for [**10-10**].
