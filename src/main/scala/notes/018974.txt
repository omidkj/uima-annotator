HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male
patient who initially presented with back pain.  Upon work-up
for that was found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm which
has been followed in recent months by echocardiography.  In
[**Month (only) 205**] the aneurysm was noted to have expanded and upon work-up
for abdominal aortic aneurysm resection, was found to have a
positive exercise tolerance test.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was then
referred to cardiac catheterization which revealed two vessel
coronary artery disease with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 40%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm as
previously noted with surgical resection pending,
hypertension, arthritis, COPD, status post CVA [**60**] years ago
with no residual.

MEDICATIONS:  Toprol 200 mg po q d, Norvasc 10 mg po q d,
Ativan 0.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn, Aspirin 325 mg po q d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a smoker who continues to
smoke ?????? pack of cigarettes per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission revealed vital signs
within normal limits and an unremarkable physical
examination.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
the day of surgery, [**2146-9-2**], was taken to the operating room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three
with a LIMA to the LAD, a vein to the OM and a vein to the
diagonal.  Postoperatively the patient was on Dobutamine,
Propofol IV drip and was atrially paced.  He was transported
from the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit.
Postoperative day #1 the patient had been weaned off his
vasoactive drip, his pulmonary artery catheter was
discontinued, he had been weaned from mechanical ventilator
and extubated, his chest tubes were discontinued, the patient
was started on diuretic and beta blocker and was transferred
out of the Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor.  Early
the following day on postoperative day #2 the patient was
noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation for which he was
started on IV Amiodarone as well as an increase in his
Lopressor dose was initiated.  The patient was also noted on
postoperative day #1 by routine chest x-ray which was
obtained after the chest tubes were discontinued, he was
noted to have bilateral apical pneumothoraces.  The patient
did receive bilateral chest tubes for this and was followed
with subsequent chest x-rays which showed resolution in the
pneumothoraces.  After approximately 48 hours with the chest
tubes in, the right pleural tube was discontinued with no
sequella, the left, however, continued to have a small air
leak and was left in for an additional 24 hours.  This was
ultimately discontinued on [**9-7**].  On postoperative day #5, a
follow-up chest x-ray had subsequently revealed no
pneumothoraces and was essentially a normal x-ray.  The
patient had been started on anticoagulation due to multiple
bouts of postoperative atrial fibrillation and was begun on
Coumadin.  On postoperative day #6, [**2146-8-12**], the patient
remained hemodynamically stable, his oxygenation was adequate
on room air, he was approximately at his preoperative weight
and remained in atrial fibrillation with a controlled
ventricular response and adequate blood pressure.  It was
felt that he had remained stable for a significant period of
time and was ready to be discharged home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature 98, blood pressure
119/58, respiratory rate 20.  His weight on the day of
discharge 103.2 kg which is essentially the same as his
preoperative weight of 103 kg.  Most recent laboratory
values, white blood cell count of 11.5, hematocrit 23.5 which
was down slightly from his previous hematocrit of 25,
although the patient was asymptomatic.  With this hematocrit
it was felt appropriate to discharge him and start him on
iron.  Other laboratory values revealed a PT of 12.4 with INR
of 1.1, BUN 24, creatinine 1.0.

On physical examination, neurologically the patient is alert
and oriented with a steady gait.  His cardiac exam was
unremarkable while irregular with no murmur and no gallop.
Sternum is stable, incisions clean, dry and intact with
Steri-Strips.  His lungs are clear to auscultation.  There
was a tiny amount of subcu emphysema anteriorly from the 4th
to 8th intercostal space.  Room air oxygen saturation was
96%.  His abdomen was soft, obese with positive bowel sounds
in all four quadrants with a palpable abdominal aortic
aneurysm noted.  His legs were warm, well perfused, with
palpable pulses in his feet.  His incision to his right leg
is clean, dry with Steri-Strips intact and minimal edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 5 mg upon the day of
discharge.  PT INR is to be followed by [**Hospital 197**] Clinic and
Dr.[**Name (NI) 35367**] office with PT, INR scheduled for [**9-9**] with
the results to be called to Dr.[**Name (NI) 35367**] office, to
continue his Coumadin dosing for his atrial fibrillation.
Other discharge medications, Amiodarone 400 mg po tid until
[**2146-9-16**], then it should be decreased to 400 mg po bid times 7
days, then 200 mg q d as a maintenance dose until
discontinued by primary care physician or cardiologist,
Lopressor 75 mg po bid, Lasix 20 mg po bid times 7 days,
potassium chloride 20 mEq po bid times 7 days, Zantac 150 mg
po bid, Dilaudid 2 mg po q 4-6 hours prn pain, Aspirin 81 mg
po q d, Niferex 150 mg po q d, Colace 100 mg po bid.  The
patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as previously
noted for his Coumadin dosing.  The patient is to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in 6 weeks for postoperative check.
