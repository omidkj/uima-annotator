ECG Study Date of [**2156-6-24**]  11:17:02 PM
Possible atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and 2:1
block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-6-15**] the ventricular rate
is faster.
..
Imaging:
CXR [**2156-6-24**]:  A dual-lead cardiac pacing device is unchanged
with leads in appropriate atrial and ventricular positions. A
right peripherally inserted central catheter has been removed.
Multiple median sternotomy wires are stable as are vascular
clips from coronary arterial bypass grafting. Heart size is
stable as are mediastinal and hilar contours. Calcification
along the aorta is unchanged. Note is also made of bibasilar
subsegmental atelectasis. There is no pulmonary edema.
.
Tagged RBC scan [**2156-6-25**]:  No active GI bleeding through 101
minutes.
.
TTE [**2156-6-28**]: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with diffuse biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2156-6-10**], biventricular systolic function
is now depressed. LVEF = 30%
.
U/S of b/l UE's and LE's [**2156-6-29**]:
1. DVT of the right common femoral vein and superficial veins.
2. Extension of prior right upper extremity DVT into the right
subclavian
vein.
3. Superficial thrombosis of the left upper extremity basilic
and cephalic
veins.

Micro:
[**6-30**] Blood culture x 2: enterobacter cloacae (sensitive to

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old woman with PMH s/f UGI bleeding,
multiple DVTs, CAD s/p CABG, Afib/flutter, COPD, DM, s/p
aortobifem bypass, ischemic colitis s/p colectomy, who was
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 35589**] for UGI bleed and RUE DVT,
presented on [**6-25**] with recurrent upper GI bleed, and whose
hospital course has included Afib/flutter, persistent
tachycardia, RUE and RLE DVT and LUE and LLE superficial
thrombophlebitis, worsening CHF, UTI, delirium and diarrhea.
.
#) GI Bleed: The patient had a recent h/o GI bleed with
visualized duodenal ulcers. She initially presented with
hematemesis and melana. An EGD showed no active bleeding and 2
healing duodenal ulcers. A tagged red cell scan was negative for
active bleeding. She intitially had a hematocrit of 31 and
received 4U of PRBCs upon admission. She refused gastric lavage,
but it is presumed this was an upper GI bleed. Her hematocrit
was stable from [**6-26**] until the day of discharge, when it was
42.7. Her anticoagulation was stopped and should be restarted in
4 weeks to treat her R UE DVT, R LE DVT, and likely PE. She
continues on heparin SQ prophylaxis 5000 U TID. She was
continued on pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# DELIRIUM: The patient was diagnosed with hypoactive delirium
by psychiatry. They recommended environmental modifications for
delirium (dark, quiet room with minimal disruptions at night;
awake during day), the avoidance of deliriogenic medications
(ie, benzos, opiates, Benadryl, etc). B12/folate levels were
normal/high. Head CT was negative. The patient was started on
olanzipine 2.5 mg qhs. On the day of discharge, the patient was
intermittently somnolent, but oriented to person, place, and
month.
.
#. Tachycardia/CAD/AFib: The patient had consistent HR in the
90s-120s. EKG and telemetry showed atrial flutter. This was
likely exacerbated hy her DVTs/PE. Her metoprolol was increased
to 100 mg QID, which was tolerated by her blood pressure. She
has had no recent events of atrial flutter with rapid
ventricular response on telemetry. Cardiology followed the
patient during admission.
.
#. Recent C. Diff colitis: For the patient's reported history of
C.diff colitis during her last admission in early-mid [**May 2156**],
the patient has completed a course of PO vancomycin and flagyl.
She did not have diarrhea after transfer to the floor and her
