[**2153-8-16**] Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg. The estimated right
atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is probably mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = ?40 %; views are technically suboptimal for assessment
of wall motion).[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly  thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened and do not
coapt. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is at least moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (given elevated high
IVC/RA pressure and measured TR jet velocity).

[**8-14**]/o7 CXR AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The
Port-A-Cath device is in stable position. Moderate left pleural
effusion is not significantly changed compared to the study of
seven hours prior. Right lung is grossly clear. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax. The patient is status post CABG.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change and moderate
left-sided pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient had brief stay in MICU, was medically managed with
kayexalate, insulin and albuterol,  and hyperkalemia resolved.
Was on [**Location **] service with progressive increase in
abdominal girth and pleural effusions. Cardiology was consulted,
decided to hold spironolactone ACEI, BB, and to continue with
Lasix.  On night of [**8-15**] had 2 Units PRBCs with total 100mg IV
lasix but developed shortness of breath with slightly increased
oxygen requirment. Put out minimal urine to lasix with continued
dyspnea and oxygen requirment initiating transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**]
service for higher level managment (i.e. lasix drip). Had second
large volume paracentesis [**8-16**] with removal of 4 iters and
administration of 37.5gm [**Month/Year (2) 61990**] for prevention of hepatorenal
syndrome in setting of acute renal failure.  Lasix drip 10mg/hr
was begun on [**8-16**].  the following morning the patient was
negative 1.2L. His systolic blood pressure was stable as it
remained in the 100's. He continued on the lasix drip through
[**8-17**], with the goal of keeping him negative another 1-2L.  By
[**8-18**] the patient was negative 4.5L.  His Lasix was discontinued
and bumetonide 1mg IV BID was added because it has better
absorption from the GI tract. Endocrinology was consulted for
recommendations regarding the patient's hypothyroidism, and they
suggested remeasuring TSH and free T4 next week. Also on [**8-18**],
the patient was demanding to go home, he began to refuse vital
sign checks and medications and threatened to leave AMA.  His
placement was complicated by the fact that the [**Hospital1 1501**] he came from
did reserve his bed.  The earliest he could have been rescreened
was Monday, but he insisted on being home by Sunday for a family
engagement.  Sending him home with services was not an issue
because he has been blacklisted by VNA.  The medical team did
not feel it was safe to send him home, and eventually the
patient left against medical advice.
