History of Present Illness:
68M with history of ETOH abuse, afib on coumadin who was
transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital where he presented after
being being found down by a neighbor with altered mental status
and with blood at his oropharynx. On arrival to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
Hospital, he was hypothermic with rectal temp of 93. He was
given Octreotide and Protonix given concern for UGIB, 1 unit
pRBC, 2 FFP, Vit K, 1 pRBC, Zosyn for lung infiltrates on CT
chest and a banana bag. He was noted to have a CK of >3000 and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher care.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals were  T= 96.4 HR=97 BP= 93/69
RR= 24. On arrival here, he was continued on protonix and
octreotide gtts and vancomycin was added to his abx coverage. An
NG lavage was negative. Stool was brown and OB +. A bedside US
showed, GB sludge and he went for a RUQ which showed sludge but
not acute cholecystitis. He was started on IVF for rhabdo.
.
On arrival, he denies pain. History was limited as his mouth was
caked with dried blood. He states that he slipped and fell and
bit his lip and that is how the blood got in his mouth. He
denies hematemesis, melena or hematochezia. He also denies any
abdominal pain. He drinks 2-3 beers per day and [**1-31**] glasses of
wine (self reported, not confirmed). He states that his hands
have been purple in the past and that he has been told he has
Raynauds.
.
Review of systems:

Imaging:
========

[**5-16**] Liver u/s:
1. Fatty liver. Other forms of more serious liver disease such
as hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
2. Gallbladder sludge, without acute cholecystitis.
.
[**5-16**] CXR: Right hilar enlargement should be further evaluated
with
conventional PA and lateral films, when feasible.
.
[**5-17**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not
well seen. Aortic stenosis is present (likely minimal or mild
but not quantified). No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
[**5-18**] LENI: Thrombosis of the right posterior tibialis vein (calf
vein).
.
[**5-20**] TTE: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**5-23**] U/S:
1. Gallbladder sludge with slight wall thickening and slightly
decreased
distention. These findings are nonspecific in the setting low
albumin and
there is no definite evidence for cholecystitis. A HIDA should
be performed if clinical concern for cholecystitis warrants.
2. Prominent CBD, but no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation
and no change from [**5-15**].
3. Bilateral pleural effusions and trace ascites.
4. Echogenic liver which may be due to fatty infiltration,
although other
forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis are not
excluded.
.
[**5-24**] HIDA:
Normal study, specifically with no evidence of cholecystitis
.
[**5-25**] CXR:
An endotracheal tube, right subclavian central venous line, and
nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. There is no
pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged. There
is moderate pulmonary edema which is not significantly changed.
There is persistent retrocardiac opacity, as well as bibasilar
opacities, greater on the left, likely representing a
combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
Overall, the appearance is unchanged.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo found down who presented from OSH with elevated CK,
leukocytosis, bandemia, hypothermia, and hypotension.  Pt also
with ecchymosis, impaired wound healing.  Patient had extende
MICU course with respiratory failure, severe volume overload,
ventilator acquired pseudomonal pneumonia.
.
# Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated on [**5-17**].
Etiolgy of respiratory failure likely multifactorial - secondary
to aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and possible pulmonary
embolism (although this was not confirmed initially as patient
was not stable for CT scan).  Patient was intubated and remained
intubated until [**6-3**] when a tracheostomy was placed.  Patient
was treated with ARDS protocol with low tidal volumes and high
PEEP.  Patient was treated initially for aspiration pneumonia
with unasyn and then pseudomonal ventilator acquired pneumonia
with cefepime.

Several days in to admission patient was +26L - severe volume
overload felt to be contributing to symptoms.  Patient was
diuresed with lasix gtt which was supplemented with diuril,
metolazone, and acetolazomide.  Diuresis was difficult because
of potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis, as well as
hypotension. He was treated for his aspiration pneumonia with
cefepime. Sputum cultures grew two strains of pseudomonas and
klebsiella.  Blood cultures grew pseudomonas sensitive to
meropenem, so he was switched to meropenem for total 14 day
course, Day 1 = [**5-30**].  On [**5-28**], he self extubated himself;
however, needed to be reintubated later that evening for severe
hypoxia. [**6-3**] a tracheostomy and PEG tube were placed

Sputum cultures from [**6-7**] grew a new strain of pseudomonas, now
resistant to meropenem and susceptable to ciprofloxacin.  ID was
reconsulted and recommended that the full 14 course of meropenem
be completed on [**6-13**], while starting a 7 day course of
ciprofloxacin, Day 1 = Evening of [**6-9**].
