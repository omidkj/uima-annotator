History of Present Illness:
73 year old male  initially presented in [**Month (only) 958**] with weight loss
and difficulty swallowing food. Patient was found to have a
mediatinal mass which was biopsied and came back as B cell
lymphoma. Pt had PEG tube placed secondary to dysphagia and now
takes almost all of his nutrition via PEG. He was treated with
chemotherapy with a combination of mitoxantrone, vincristine,
cyclophosphamide, cortical steroids, and Rituxan and following
three treatments he transferred his care to the Cancer Center
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69369**]. He has subsequently completed 6 full cycles of
chemotherapy and is now being considered for XRT. His last dose
of chemotherapy was one month prior to admission at [**Hospital3 25354**].  Despite the chemotherapy, the mediastinal
mass has not improved and it was felt that perhaps the area
could be rebiopsied to confirm diagnosis (as first biopsy done
in [**State 108**]).
.
The patient has had intermittent episodes of dull chest pain in
varied locations across his chest, radiating to his back when it
is particularly severe, which became notably worse this past
Friday. No diaphoresis, radiation to jaw or arms, or nausea
associated with the chest pain. He also has frequent episodes of
nausea, with vomiting on an almost daily basis. Otherwise he
feels well. Denies any cough or cold symptoms except for some
very mild intermittent rhinorrhea, no fevers or cough; denies
hematemesis, hemoptysis, BRBPR, melana, or hematuria.

He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-23**] for planned IP stent given
patient's increasing difficulty with breathing.  He had the
stent placed on [**7-24**] and he reports his breathing feels much
improved.

Past Medical History:

Kappa light chain restricted population.  They co-express pan-B
cell markers CD19 (dim), 20 (dim), 22 along with CD10 (dim)
FMC-7 (subset), HLA-DR.  [**Last Name (STitle) 20282**] do not express any other
characteristic antigens including CD5. T cells express mature
lineage antigens. Immunophenotypic findings consistent with
involvement by CD19+(dim)/CD20+(dim)/CD10+(dim), CD5 negative,
monoclonal kappa (dim) B cell lymphoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 y.o. man with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, infrarenal AAA, and
posterior mediastinal mass with prior biopsy consistent with
non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma who presented to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital
for repeat biopsy, at which time he became acutely short of
breath and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a bronchial stent.

1) Mediastinal Mass: The patient has a large posterior
mediastinal mass obstructing esophagus and now compressing
bronchi and pulmonary vasculature. This was diagnosed as
Non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma at outside hospital ([**State 108**]). The
patient is now s/p chemotherapy with no radiographic
improvement. Following admission, he underwent a left mainstem
stent by the interventional pulmonary service on [**7-24**]; repeat
bronchoscopy on [**7-27**] showed that the stent was patent and there
was no need for a right mainstem stent. The pathology was
consistent with lymphoma (see attached report).  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a repeat bronchoscopy and possible
stent removal. At time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 53636**]; he was
provided
with home oxygen for ambulation (given oxygen saturation 90%
with ambulation). The patient will follow-up with his primary
oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69369**] and is scheduled for outpatient radiation
therapy (starting Monday [**2186-7-28**]).

2) Relative hypotension: The patient's blood pressures remained
in the low 100s, possibly due to  poor intake due to nausea or
IVC compression from mediastinal mass. His amlodipne was held
throughout his hospital course. His blood pressure should be
closely monitored as an outpatient, as his PCP may need to
restart anti-hypertensive agents. follow-up for his need to
re-start.
