Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Quinine / Sulfonamides

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and Hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) **] was an 84 year-old lady with a history of ESRD on
hemodialyis, CAD/CABG/Recent NSTEMI, Iscuemic CHF (EF 20%) who
presented from her nursing home with dyspnea and hypotension.

She was recently admitted (from [**2106-2-24**] to [**2106-3-12**]) for a right
hip reconstructive hemiarthroplasty. Her post-op course was
complicated by hypotension, requiring vasopressors (neo->
levophed). She was transferred to the CCU, where CEs were
negative; she was briefly on the medical floor, but was
transferred to the MICU for hypotension and respiratory arrest
requiring intubation. An inferiorlateral NSTEMI was then
diagnosed. She underwent cardiac cath ([**2106-2-27**]) at which time a
LCX instent stenosis was noted; a Taxus stent placed. Given her
EF 20-25% on follow-up TTE, she was started on digoxin and
warfarin. Her course was also complicated by C. diff colitis,
which resolved with Flagyl.

She was then relatively well, until 3PM on the day prior to her
current admission when she became acutely dyspnic. She reported
associated [**9-4**] central aching chest pain, worsened with
inspiration. There was no radiation or associated palpitations,
presyncope, nausea, vomiting. The pain resolved spontaneously
after 15 minutes. At the NH, her VS were: T100.4, HR118,
BP84/55. She received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal response. She
received two albuterol nebulizers with some improvement. Given
her SBPs to the 60s-80s (with a baseline BP in the 90s), she was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. In the ED,
she received Levofloxacin 500 mg IV and 1 liter of NS. She
reported improved dyspnea upon transfer to the floor and had no
current chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
lightheadedness, or diaphoresis.

ROS: no headache, rhinorrhea, sore throat, (+) non-productive
cough, no fevers, chills (+) diarrhea (incontinent of multiple
BM/day). No dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 23**] was admitted with an end-stage ischemic
cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20%), ESRD and new-onset dyspnea from a
presumed CHF exacerbation. She was in persistent borderline
cardiogenic shock, with difficult to manage CHF and hypotension
throughout her course. She had a prolonged hospital stay,
including ICU transfers. Given the lack of success in treating
her CHF and hypotension, the patient and her family change their
goals of care to comfort. After withdrawal of dialysis and
aggressive measures to treat her cardiovascular condition, the
patient passed away comfortably.

Hypotension and CHF: She had a known extensive CAD history, with
prior CABG and recent NSTEMI, and thus an ischemic
cardiomyopathy with a LVEF of 20%. Her baseline SBPs were in the
90s, but ranged from the 50s to 80s for most of her course.
Initial success was had with diuresis, but renal failure ensued.
She thus required HD/Ultrafiltration for fluid removal. The
medical and ICU teams walked a fine line between comfort,
hypotension with lack of cerebral perfusion, oliguria and flash
pulmonary edema. Thus, her course included multipe admissions to
ICU (after suffering marked dyspnea and hypoxia while on the
floor and hemodialysis units) and bouts of intubation and
mechanical ventilation. Extubation trials had relative success
for short periods of time, but she would develop rapid
progression of her dyspnea and have episodes of flash pulmonary
edema. Despite her poor prognosis, which was well known to both
the patient and the family, the patient wanted to continue
pursuing aggressive measures early in her course. Later on, she
decided to make comfort her primary goal. Thus, hemodialysis and
mechanical ventilatory support trials were not pursued. She was
continued on ace-inhibitor and beta-blocker to prevent pulmonary
edema. As hemodialyis was not pursued, she slowly became less
reponsive, but never seemed uncomfortable for the last week of
her course. She passed away from presumptive kidney failure and
heart failure.
