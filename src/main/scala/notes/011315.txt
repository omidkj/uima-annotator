HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service for further evaluation and treatment of her acute and
chronic renal failure.  The patient's urine electrolytes were
checked.  Renal ultrasound was obtained.  Renal ultrasound on
[**2164-3-7**] shows no mass, no hydronephrosis, bilateral
nephrolithiasis.  Renal consult was obtained immediately
after admission and followed the patient throughout her
hospitalization.  On [**2164-3-7**], the patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
hypotension and bradycardia.  The patient's blood pressure
was stabilized and the patient transferred back to the
medical floor.  After several days in the Intensive Care Unit
she was transferred to the regular medicine floor [**2164-3-10**].  During her intensive care stay, the patient was
started on hemodialysis three times a week.  While on the
medical floor the patient was noted to have episodes of rapid
atrial fibrillation, however, she remained hemodynamically
stable.  Beta blockers were used cautiously given her history
of a junctional rhythm and resultant hypotension in response
to beta blockers prior to her Intensive Care Unit stay.  The
patient was ultimately discharged on [**2164-3-14**].
