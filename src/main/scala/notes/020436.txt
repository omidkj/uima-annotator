Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**]
Chief Complaint:
R-sided flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exchange of the right and left nephrostomy tubes


History of Present Illness:
In brief, the patient is a 52 F h/o metastatic colon ca recently
place on hospice care and s/p bilateral nephrostomy tube
placement.  She presented to the ED on [**6-26**] with acute onset of
R sided flank pain, associated with nausea and nonbloody
vomiting on the evening of [**6-25**]. No fever, CP, SOB.

On arrival to the ED, T 98, HR 100, 160/117, 16, 95%RA. Exam
revealed diffusely tender abdomen without any peritoneal sign.
WBC 20, Cr 1.9 (baseline 0.8), lactate 4.3. Non-contrast
abdominal CT revealed R-sided hydronephrosis with fat stranding.
She received ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and pip-tazo. After 3L of
NS, her lactate went down to 3.7, and her HR down to 80s. IR
replaced nephrostomy tubes on both sides.  She was admitted to
the MICU.  She received IVF but never received vasopressors.
Her lactate trended down.  Her urine output improved.  She had
both nephrostomy tubes placed with good effect.  Her creatinine
peaked at 1.9, is now 1.4.

She is now transferred to the floor.  Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] feels much
better.  She has chronic constipation and abdominal discomfort,
but takes no narcotics.  Her R flank is still slightly painful,
but improved.  She is still somewhat nauseated.

gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied diarrhea, constipation. No

Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
She initially presented on [**2173-12-18**] to the Emergency
Department with abdominal pain and pelvic pain.  She said at
that time the pain was predominantly in her lower pelvic area.
On a CT scan on [**2173-12-18**], she had a large pelvic mass
measuring 14 x 8 x 8 cm.  She underwent a TAHBSO and
ileocolectomy on [**2173-12-20**].  On frozen section, it was found
that the tumor was most consistent with a colonic primary.  On
final pathology, it was found to be a 7-cm colon cancer, which
was a pT3 N2 M1 with metastases to the ovary.  She
was discharged from that admission on [**12-28**].  She had a Port
placed on [**2174-2-14**].  She started on capecitabine, oxaliplatin on
[**2174-2-14**].  Of note, she is K-RAS mutation positive for the Gly-12
[**Male First Name (un) **].  Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] was admitted on [**2174-4-5**] due to abdominal pain
and was found to be in acute renal failure.  Based on this, she
had bilateral nephrostomy tube placement performed at that time.
 Of note, on her CT on [**2174-4-5**], she had evidence of disease
progression.  She completed three cycles of Capecitabine and
oxaliplatin.  She had evidence of CT progression on a scan
performed on [**2174-4-5**].  Based upon that, we changed her to
irinotecan alone, which she received for one cycle.  She ended
up having another CT performed on [**2174-5-18**] to evaluate
hydronephrosis which showed further disease progression. As her
disease continued to progress despite chemotherapy, she started
receiving hospice care in [**6-18**].

Images:
Abd CT abd/pelvis ([**6-27**]):
1. No evidence of free air. No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Free fluid in the abdomen. Please note that evaluation is
limited due to lack of IV and oral contrast.
2. Evidence of significant hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the
right, with significant fat stranding and areas of fluid
attenuation which could suggest urinoma. Findings are concerning
for nonfunctioning right nephrostomy tube. 3. Innumerable
hepatic and splenic lesions, with similar appearance compared to
prior study consistent with metastatic disease. Peritoneal
carcinomatosis with multiple mesenteric and peritoneal soft
tissue implants.
4. Cholelithiasis with possible gallbladder adenomyomatosis.

CXR ([**6-27**]): Vague lucency in the right upper abdomen may
represent interposed bowel or gas related to nephrostomy tubes,
but free air or gas in a collection cannot be excluded. CT may
be helpful for further evaluation depending on level of clinical
concern.

Bilateral nephrostomy tube change ([**6-27**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Successful exchange of bilateral indwelling nephrostomy
catheters with new 8 French Flexima nephrostomy catheter.
2. Moderate-to-severe right-sided hydronephrosis.

ANTEGRADE UROGRAPHY([**6-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Right-sided percutaneous nephrostomy tube patent and in
correct position within the renal pelvis.
2. Possible obstruction within the tube/bag which was exchanged.
The patient was also educated regarding nephrostomy tube flushes
b.i.d.

KUB ([**6-30**]):
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with air seen
throughout the large and small bowel.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo female with metastatic colon ca s/p b/l nephrostomy tube
placement admittd with right-sided flank pain, N/V, found to
have severe R-sided hydronephrosis, s/p b/l nephrostomy
replacement.

# Hydronephrosis: The patient's ARF resolved with nephrostomy
tube change. Her left nephrostomy tube consistently put out good
urine output, however her right nephrostomy tube had low output
intermittently.  IR evaluated it several times and brought her
back for a urogram, however the tube appeared to be in the
correct position.  They recommended twice daily flushing of the
tube to maintain patency. Urine culture only grew out yeast
which is likely due to colonization.  She was initally treated
with 4 days of ceftriaxone due for high suscipicion of
hydronephrosis.  This was changed to cefpodoxime and she was
discharged to complete a 10 day course as an outpatient.

# N/V/Constipation: The patient had over a week of constipation
on admission.  She was treated with colace, senna, lactulose,
and a dulcola
