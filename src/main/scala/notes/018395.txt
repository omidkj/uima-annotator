Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amoxicillin / Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
acute confusional state

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lumbar puncture
mechanical ventillation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78 year old left handed man with hypertension,
status post aortic valve replacement in [**2166**] (porcine),
hypercholestrolemia, status post partial lung resection
[**2172-12-4**], who was brought to the ED [**3-2**] after confusion x1 day.
.
A fellow priest noted that the patient was confused in the
morning of the day of presentation. The confusion progressed and
by pm the patient was only able to mumble. He also had an acute
onset of frontal headache and eye pain that started 10 hours
following the onset of confusion.
.
The PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and after evaluation he was brought to the
ED per EMS. The code stroke team was activated as it was not
clear at that time that the confusion had [**Doctor First Name **] going on for half
a day.  The patient was noted per ED note to have phonemic
paraphasias, R sided neglect, and ? R hemianopsia. NIHSS~6.  A
CT head with motion artifact showed no apparent hemorrhage,
mass, edema, and no obvious infarct except for a chronic
appearing infarct in the L caudate head. At that time, the
patient was deemed a candidate for IV tPA. After tPA he was
tranferred to the unit for further observation and management.
.
Additionally, pt denied HA, diplopia, blurry vision, tinnitus,
vertigo, dysphagia, dysarthria, incoordination, focal
weakness/numbness.  No fever or chills, weight loss, SOB, chest
pain or pressure, palpitations, nausea, vomitting, abdominal
pain, constipation, diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pains, rash or
dysuria.


Past Medical History:
1. Aortic valve replacement/Coronary artery bypass graft with
LIMA graft [**2166**]
2. Right-hip replacemt [**2164**] with revision
3. Hypertension
4. Ankylosing spondylitis
5. Right thoracoscopy with multiple wedge excisions [**2172-12-4**],
with multiple intercostal nerve blocks
6. Left pleural effusion, trapped left lower lobe (fibrothorax)
in [**10-12**]
7. Hypertension


Social History:

.
CT head [**3-2**]: These images are all markedly limited by motion
artifact in spite of being repeated three additional times. Even
the last series is significantly limited. However, there is no
obvious intracranial hemorrhage. There are mild age-related
involutional changes, and greater atrophy within the cerebellum.
There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus or shift of the normally
midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation
appears preserved but there are hypodensities in the right
subinsular cortex, and one in the left subinsular cortex as well
as left cerebellum, probably from small prior infarctions.
The visualized mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are
clear.
There are calcifications of the vertebral and cavernous carotid
arteries.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute
process.
.
CT head [**2-22**]:
Comparison is limited by motion on the prior scan. However,
there appears to be a new focus of hyperdensity in a right
frontal gyrus (image 22). Although partly obscured by motion on
the prior study, this focus was not seen previously. A tiny
calcification in the left cental sulcus. In retrospect, this
focus was probably present on the prior study.
There is no evidence of infarction, and there are no other areas
of suspicion for hemorrhage.
Conclusion: Possible tiny focus of hemorrhage in the right
frontal lobe, possibly an acute bleed. This appears new since
[**2173-3-2**], but the prior scan was limited by motion. There is a
tiny calcification in the left central sulcus.
No other evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Markedly suboptimal film with possible process
involving the left parenchymal base.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is asymmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
small. Left ventricular systolic  function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%), with apical cavity obliteration. An  apical
intracavitary gradient is identified (rest: 7 mmHg, Valsalva: 58
mmHg).  No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular  septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular  gradients. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. The mitral  valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No  mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The left ventricular
inflow  pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly  thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. No  vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
