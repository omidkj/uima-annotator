1.3-cm mass in the left renal pelvis.  The right kidney was
okay.  There a 1-cm left adrenal lesion which showed no

lipoma in the right ascending colon.

Her chest x-ray showed no acute process, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2128-10-19**], the patient was
taken to the operating room where she underwent a left
nephroureterectomy and tolerated the procedure well.  There
were no immediate complications.  Please refer to the
official Operative Note for all the details.

An intraoperative Surgery consultation was also obtained to
look for evidence of a lipoma causing her right lower
quadrant pain.  The patient received 5850 cc of intravenous
fluids i the operating room and had 500 cc of estimated blood
loss.

Immediately postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for precautionary measures
because of the patient's significant history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  The patient was receiving
Solu-Medrol intravenously with albuterol nebulizers starting
in the Postanesthesia Care Unit which were continued again in
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Her chest x-ray showed a
flattened diaphragms and hyperinflated, but no acute process.
The patient was extubated in the Postanesthesia Care Unit.

The patient was kept n.p.o. immediately postoperatively.  A
Foley catheter was in place.   A morphine patient-controlled
analgesia was given with Toradol intravenously.  The patient
did well in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She had minimal
respiratory complaints with the albuterol and Solu-Medrol.
The intravenous Solu-Medrol was tapered off and was
discontinued after her postoperative day one.  She had good
oxygen saturations throughout with no distress.  Her
nasogastric tube was removed on postoperative day one by the
Medical Intensive Care Unit team.  She was kept n.p.o. after
this.

The patient did have increased blood pressures from 140 to
160/70 to 80 and heart rates of 100 to 115.  The patient was
started on diltiazem in the Medical Intensive Care Unit which
she tolerated well.  She was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day one.

Her creatinine, which started at a baseline of 1.2
preoperatively, was 1.8 immediately postoperatively, so the
Toradol was discontinued.  This increased to about 2.2 prior
to discharge and was stable at 2.2.

On the floor, the patient did well.  She received albuterol
nebulizers and was followed by the Respiratory Therapy, and
the patient had no more respiratory problems except for one
panic attack.  The patient's blood pressure was fairly well
controlled on the diltiazem.  She was ambulating well and
having minimal pain complaints on the floor.

The patient was kept n.p.o. until postoperative day six, at
which time she had still not passed flatus.  She was started
on a clear diet at that time, and on postoperative day seven
she did pass flatus and was ready for discharge; tolerating
oral pain medications and doing well.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was stable.  She was
afebrile.  Her vital signs were stable.  Her blood pressure
was around 140/90, and her heart rate was 96.  Her breathing
was without discomfort.  Her incision still had staples, and
her Foley catheter was still in place.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home with a Foley
catheter in place.
