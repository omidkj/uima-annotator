Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F

Service:  MICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
female with multiple medical problems including insulin
dependent diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
hypercholesterolemia, who presented to the Emergency Room
with hypotension requiring pressor support.
The patient was recently admitted for chronic venous stasis
ulcers of her lower extremities.  The patient was discharged
to [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**7-27**].  Since then, by report, the patient
has had falls times three.  She most recently suffered a fall
on the morning of admission.  She fell while walking with the
physical therapist.  Later that afternoon she was found to be
very lethargic.  She was responsive but was requiring much
148.  It is noted that she was given 10 units of NPH at that
time.  Thereafter her course at [**Hospital3 2558**] was notable
for increasing somnolence, "shaking" episode, decreased
responsiveness.  Her vital signs were 122/70, heart rate of
88, respiratory rate of 26 and temperature of 98.7 at that
time.  Her fingerstick was not checked again.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].  In the
Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 69**] she
was afebrile with a blood pressure of 73/43, heart rate of
63, respiratory rate 20 and O2 saturation of 96%.  She was
noted to be somewhat somnolent but she was alert and oriented
times three.  She received three liters of IV fluids and
Dopamine drip was started.  She was given Levaquin 500 mg po
times one.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes, chronic
renal insufficiency, hypotension, atrial fibrillation
(chronic), venous stasis, left renal mass status post
nephrectomy, chronic low back pain, obesity,
hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol 50 mg po bid, Norvasc 10 mg po q d,
Lipitor 20 mg po q d, NPH 10 units subcu [**Hospital1 **], Vitamin C 500
units po q d, Zinc, Multivitamin, Coumadin 0.5 mg po q d,
Salicylate 1500 mg po bid, Lozol 2.5 mg po q d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location **].  She is a
retired secretary.  She denies any alcohol, tobacco or drug
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.8, blood pressure
120/42 on 7 mcg of Dopa.  Heart rate 68, respiratory rate 22,
O2 saturation 96% on room air.  In general the patient is
somnolent but arousable, alert and oriented times three, in
no acute distress.  HEENT: Shows dry mucus membranes,
oropharynx is clear.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  There is no elevated JVP.  The lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  There are scant rales at the
bases.  The heart has an irregularly irregular rhythm with no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
non distended.  It is obese, there are normoactive bowel
sounds.  The extremities showed 2+ pitting edema.  The right
calf has skin bandages which are clean, dry and intact.  The
neurologic exam shows cranial nerves II through XII intact.
Strength is [**4-28**] throughout and symmetric.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 8.0, hematocrit
33, platelet count 178,000, MCV 102, PT 20, INR 2.7, sodium
134, potassium 5.3, chloride 103, CO2 14, BUN 77, creatinine
2.8, anion gap 17, CKs 41, Vitamin B12 373, Folate 7.3.
Urinalysis showed [**11-13**] white cells.

RADIOLOGY:  The patient had a head CT which was negative for
any acute processes.  Chest x-ray showed upper zone
redistribution.  There was no evidence of pneumonia or
pneumothorax.  There were no pleural effusions.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation, no changes compared with old
EKGs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary the patient is a 69-year-old
diabetic female with mental status changes and hypotension
requiring pressor support who was admitted to the MICU for
further evaluation and management.  Her change in mental
status was felt to most likely be secondary to iatrogenic
hypoglycemia plus or minus a possible UTI and dehydration.
She was aggressively hydrated and she was started on
Ceftriaxone and Levaquin.  She was continued on pressors
initially until her blood pressure improved.  She improved in
the MICU.  Her hypotension was worked up and PE was
considered.  She had negative Leni's bilaterally and VQ scan
was very low probability.  However, she had an echo on [**8-2**]
which showed 3+ TR and severe pulmonary artery hypertension
with RV dilatation.  Her LVEF was approximately 55%.  She was
ruled out for adrenal insufficiency with a cortrosyn stim test.

She ultimately stabilized and was transferred out to the floor.
The etiology of her decompensation was not clear but felt most
likely to be possibly septic though the only organism found
was greater than 100,000 colonies of yeast in the urine.
There also was a question of infiltrate on chest x-ray, so
when she was transferred out to the floor she was on Diflucan
and Levaquin for infectious coverage.  While on the floor, she
began to experience increasing shortness of breath.  On [**2181-8-12**]
she developed an increased oxygen requirement so that her sats
were 88% on 100% non rebreather.  The MICU team evaluated the
patient.  Her ABG was consistent with hypoventilation
(7.24/98/50).  The patient was intubated and transferred to the
MICU.  Post intubation, her blood pressure declined to 36/palp.
IV fluids were given wide open and Levo drip was started. After
fluid resuscitation and pressors, her blood pressure rose to a
systolic in the 130's.  An A line was placed.  The respiratory
failure and hypotension was felt to most likely be
secondary to sepsis.  She was covered with broad spectrum
antibiotics.  There was no evidence of acute MI (negative EKG and
cardiac enzymes).  Swan numbers continued to show the patient
to have a low SVR and a high cardiac output consistent with
septic shock.  Her hemodynamic condition continued to slowly
deteriorate with worsening systemic hypotension, worsening
hypoxia with corresponding rise in pulmonary artery pressures.

Clinically, the patient was in CHF with also component of RHF
secondary to pulmonary hypertension/hypoxia.  Diuresis was
attempted but difficult given her low blood pressures even on
pressors.  On [**2181-8-18**] the renal team was consulted for a possible
trial of CVVH but they felt the patient was too unstable to
tolerate it.  Her family was consulted at that time and given her
grim prognosis, they decided to make her comfort measures only.
Pressors were removed and Morphine was added for comfort.
The patient was pronounced dead at 7:15 p.m. on [**2181-8-18**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Cor pulmonale.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Ventilatory failure.
4.  Insulin dependent diabetes.
5.  Septic shock.
6.  Pneumonia.
7.  Atrial fibrillation.
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
