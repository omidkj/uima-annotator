History of Present Illness:
hpi: 27 y/o female who p/w 1 wk h/o sob, difficulty lying flat,
pleuritic CP, onset of swelling of tongue, and most recently
cough. cough is the final symptom that brought the patient to
the ED. started last night with green sputum, no blood. Approx
one week ago first noted swelling of feet and hands.
subsequently noted increased swelling of tongue and difficulty
lying flat. Reports that she would develop difficulty getting
air because of "her neck". Has been sleeping sitting up. +nasal
congestion, nasal discharge. Also has noted the subacute onset
of increased SOB. Even while sitting up the patient states that
she cannot "get enough air". No sudden onset SOB. +DOE.
+pleuritic CP which she describes as "lightening sensation"
shooting down L arm. generally lasts approx one minute, worse w/
inspiration. unchanged w/ ambulation. Has also developed cough
over the last day, productive of green sputum. No known sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] recent travel. No insect/tick bites. No exposure to

ECHO [**2137-9-3**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion (may be small in subcostal views but views
suboptimal) without evidence of tamponade.

abscess or intraspinal fluid collection.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 27 yo f admitted for hypotension with SOB, URI symptoms,
mild soft palate swelling, elevated CK, vaginal discharge and
chronic low-back pain.
.
Hypotension: She was admitted to the MICU out of concern for
hypotension as her BP in the ED was initially 112/50, but
dropped to 89/54. She has been normotensive in the ICU and this
hypotension may have been [**1-31**] difficulty getting an accurate
[**Location (un) 1131**] as she is obese. She was normotensive throughout her
hospital stay.
.
Oropharyngeal edema-Not significant on OP scope done by ENT,
subjectively continued to improve during her hospitalization.
Quincke's edema induced by cocaine was thought to be possible so
she was treated with dexamethasone for total 5 doses with
benedryl and famotidine but this did not seem to help her
subjective symptoms. ENT suggested that edema could be [**1-31**] OSA,
if so may improve with CPAP. CPAP arranged for home use, she
will need OP f/u and sleep study to be arranged. C1 esterase
inhibitor assay was also sent and pending at the time of
discharge. In the chance that they may be contributing, NSAIDS
were stopped at the time of discharge.
.
Elevated CK-On admission she had an elevated CK with flat
tropnin/MB. This was thought likely related to recent cocaine
use and trended down steadily during her hospital course.
.
Leukocytosis-WBC was noted to rise after initiation of steroids,
and peaked at 18.6. During this time she did not show any
obvious signs of infection but a urine specimen from [**9-5**] grew
>100,000 e. coli sensitive to cipro. Though she did not complain
of symptoms of UTI she was started on 3 day course of cipro and
her WBC fell 14.1 on day of discharge.
.
E.coli on Urine culture [**9-5**]-subsequent cultures no growth, pt.
asymptomatic, urine without LE or WBC's, however as leukocytosis
increasing she was started on cipro 500mg po q12 (day 1=[**9-7**]) for
3 days.
.
SOB-likely related to upper airway edema/OSA/URI-improved during
this hospitalization apparently related to CPAP use. DDimer neg
making PE unlikely, it was not thought to be [**1-31**] myocarditis as
repeat ECHO showed trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion,
unlikely to be [**1-31**] CHF as EF on ECHO >55%, CXR no edema. Pt
hypercarbic on ABG with pH 7.4, likely chronic CO2 retention
from obstructive lung disease.
.
Peripheral Edema-was improved by time of discharge, unclear
etiology, no evidence of protein in urine on admission, likely
not nephrotic syndrome, likley related to poor venous return in
obese.
.
Low back pain-chronic, midline, no saddle-anesthesia/bowel
incontinence, urinary incontinence sounds like stress
incontinence rather than neurogenic, not unusual given
obesity/h/o constipation; MRI showed degenerative disk disease
of the L3-L4 with mild bulging of L5-S1 with no herniation,
spinal stenosis, or nerve root compression, also abscess or
fluid
