CTA [**7-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. There is a moderate-sized new pericardial effusion.
2. Sternal decissence. Bony irregularity is detected in the bony
oppositional regions with stranding of the surrounding
subcutaneous and mediastinal fat. There are also prominent
superior mediastinal lymph nodes which were not present on
previous study. Infection in the region of the sternal
decissence cannot be excluded.
3. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection identified.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated relaxation
atelectasis, more prominent on the left.
.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Improving bibasilar atelectasis. Persistent
bilateral pleural effusions, slightly decreased on the left.
.
[**7-20**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. A mitral
valve annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring
appears well seated and is not obstructing flow. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small
to moderate sized inferolateral pericardial effusion without
evidence for hemodynamic compromise.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo F s/p MVR, ASD closure [**6-1**] presenting with severe sharp
substernal CP, SOB, and brief episode of light-headedness.  The
patient had a CTA chest performed to rule out PE and dissection,
notable for sternal dehiscence, moderate pericardial effusion
and fat stranding with lymphadenopathy.  EKG with diffuse PR
depressions and ST elevations.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Cardiothoracic surgery was conulted.  Pt's presentation felt to
be consistent with post-pericardiotomy syndrome.  She was
started on ibuprofen and colchicine with significant improvement
in her pain.

On hospital day #2, the pt became febrile to a temperature of
101.2. CXR showed atelectasis at the lung bases; CXR, UA and
urine culture, and blood cultures were nonsuggestive of
infection. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for the
possibility of infection secondary to sternal dehiscence;
however, the CT team felt that there was no clinical evidence to
support this. Fever subsided later that day with high-dose
NSAIDs and the patient was (afebrile) for the remainder of her
hospital course.

The patient was monitored on telemetry for the duration of the
hospital stay with no significant events. The patient was
maintained on a bowel regimen, PPI, sc heparin tid  and was
discharged to home in good condition.
