Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with CAD s/p MI in [**2158**] and
[**2166**], PPM implanted in [**2174**], CHF, PVD, and HTN who presented to
[**Hospital 1902**] clinic to transfer his medical care to [**Hospital1 18**].  He reported 6
weeks of increasing leg swelling, worsening dyspnea with minimal
exertion, PND, orthopnea, and occasional lightheadedness.  He
denied any recent CP, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, or syncope.  Labs reviewed from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] on
[**2176-12-24**] showed K 5.2, BUN 84, Creatinine 3.5, and TSH 6.9.  He
was directly admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service for management of his
acute on chronic CHF and acute renal failure.
.
He reports that his symptoms began shortly before [**Holiday 1451**].
He has never had a similar episode in the past.  Prior to then,
he was quite active, climbing stairs without problems, walking
regularly, and using a stationary bike for 30 minutes daily.  He
has become progressively more fatigued and now becomes SOB with
minimal activity such as standing up from a chair.  He has also
had difficulty sleeping due to SOB when lying down.  He has been
unable to lie down flat.  He has developed LE edema and scotal
swelling.  He also has a new foot lesion overlying his right
great toe which has been painful.  He says that he feels thirsty
constantly but has decreased appetite.  His family also noted
that his weight has increased from 124 lbs several weeks ago to
142 lbs now.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills, or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2177-1-1**] 5:52 PM

FINDINGS: There is a left ICD pacemaker with leads in the right
atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. There are looped
leads in the left brachiocephalic vein. There is a moderate
right pleural effusion and no left pleural effusion. There is
right basilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. There
is severe cardiomegaly with a large right atrium. The
mediastinal contours are normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate right pleural effusion.
2. Severe cardiomegaly with right atrial enlargement.
3. Right basilar atelectasis.
.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with CAD s/p MI in [**2158**] and
[**2166**], PPM implanted in [**2174**], CHF, PVD, and HTN who presents with
acute on chronic CHF and acute renal failure.
.
# Pump: He has a history of CHF secondary to his MI in [**2166**], but
reports never having an episode similar to this.  He is not
aware of any preceding trigger or dietary changes.  He was
taking Lasix 20 mg PO daily at home, but over the last 6 weeks
developed worsening volume overload with anasarca and SOB.  His
pulmonary exam and CXR show a right sided pleural effusion.  His
echo on [**2177-1-2**] showed LVEF 20%, inferior posterior akinesis,
and hypokinesis of the remaining left ventricle.  He was started
on a Lasix drip at 10 mg/hr on admission.  He was placed on a
low sodium diet with 1.5 L daily fluid restriction.  His Lasix
dose was increased the next day to 12 mg/hr with the addition of
Metolazone 2.5 mg PO BID.  He had fair urine output with this
regimen and reported improvement in his SOB and LE edema, but
will need significantly more diuresis to reach euvolemia.  He
was transfered to the CCU in order to initiate Milrinone for
more aggressive diuresis. In the CCU, patient briefly required
phenylepherine while on milrone gtt but was eventually weaned
off. He will be discharged on milrinone drip and torsemide 20 mg
with sBP in the 70-80s range, with good mental status and
stabilized renal function.
.
# Rhythm: He first received an ICD in [**2166**] after a syncopal
episode.  He had a St. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10550**] 3207-36 PPM with ICD implanted
on [**2174-7-21**].  He is anticoagulated with Coumadin for underlying
AFib, but is unaware of this diagnosis.  He is biventricular
paced and pacemaker dependent per [**Hospital1 2025**] records.  His device was
recently interrogated and will need to be replaced soon per
records.  INR was suprtherapeutic at 4.3 on admission, coumadin
was stopped. Patient will continue Aspirin after discharge.
