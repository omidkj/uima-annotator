History of Present Illness:
This  83year old white female with history of triple vessel
disease has previously undergone stenting to the circumfle
artery (3/[**2191**]).  She reports that over the past several weeks
she has developed progressively worsening dyspnea, orthopnea,
and palpitations, equivalent to anginal symptoms in [**2191**] prior
to the stent. In the ED she received SL NTG and Plavix but
refused aspirin.  EKG showed ST depressions in III, AVF, V5-6
new compared to old. Cardiac enzymes were negative.  Cardiac
catheterization confirmed three vessel disease and cardiac
surgery was consulted for evaluation for operation.

Pertinent Results:
OFF-PUMP CABG:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen
at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal for the patient's body size.
4. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility.
5. There are simple atheroma and calcification in the ascending
aorta by TEE and epi9aortic scan. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
POST Off-pump CABG, there is preservation of normal
biventricular systolic function. LVEF is now 65% The MR, TR are
unchanged.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted on [**12-31**] from the ER for EKG changes and
orthopnea, as well as palpitations. Enzymes were negative and
she received Plavix. Cardiac catheterization  revealed severe
triple vessel disease .Plavix washout done and she underwent
surgery with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**1-7**]. See operative note for
details.

She was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on
phenylephrine and Propofol drips. She was extubated that
evening, pressors were weaned off and transferred to the floor
on POD #1.

Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery
protocol.  Beta blockers were resumed and diuresis towards her
preoperative weight was begun. Beta blocker doses were increased
for rate control and BP.  An echocardiogram was performed on POD
3 due to persistent sinus tachycardia.  No pericardial effusion
was present and the LV function was  intact at 55%.

She was changed to oral diuretics for a week course at discharge
and was progressing well. Her edema was essentially resolved and
her lungs were clear.  She was cleared by physical Therapy who
worked with her after transfer to the floor.  She was discharged
home with VNA care on medications listed elsewhere.
Arrangements were made for follow up and restrictions, wound
care and medications were discussed prior to discharge.
