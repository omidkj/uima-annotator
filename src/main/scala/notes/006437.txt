HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old male with
a history of severe COPD who is at baseline on
trach/ventilator at night, who is also steroid dependent.  He
was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.  He
initially presented to the ER at [**Hospital1 190**] on [**7-14**] with worsening shortness of breath.
The patient initially underwent trach placement in [**2162-12-11**] after developing tracheomalacia status post prolonged
MICU stay and intubation for COPD and pneumonia.  He was last
admitted to an outside hospital on [**2164-6-9**] and discharged on
[**2164-6-20**] with COPD and pneumonia.  He was treated with
Ceftazidime and steroids and discharged home on a steroid
taper, however, he had already finished antibiotic course.
He had been doing well until the day prior to admission when
he developed worsening shortness of breath, increased oxygen
requirements from 3 liters to 6 liters to requiring
ventilation at home at rest.  He had positive discordance on
the ventilator.  He denied any cough or fevers but had
increased sputum output from his trachea.  This consisted of
a thick, whitish sputum.  He denied any substernal chest pain
but did admit to left sided pleuritic chest discomfort.  On
arrival to the ER he was in near respiratory arrest.  The
vital signs, temperature was 98, heart rate 120, blood
pressure 200/100, satting 47% on 6 liters but with an Ambu
bag he was satting at 100%.  He was then placed on a trach
mask and his ABG was 7.41/77/63 on 100% trach mask.  He
received Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, Levofloxacin 500 mg.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a home
oxygen requirement as well as home ventilator dependent at
night.  The patient does have a trach collar.  His last PFTs
were [**2157**], SVC was 43%, FEV1 15%, FEV1/FVC 37%, total lung
capacity 119%.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  GERD.
5.  Depression.
6.  Anxiety.
7.  History of MRSA, pneumonia and pseudomonas pneumonia that
is resistant to Gentamycin and Ciprofloxacin but sensitive to
Ceftazidime and Piperacillin.
8.  History of a tension pneumothorax in [**2163-1-11**].

ALLERGIES:  Paxil and Vicodin.

MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone 30 mg q d, Prozac 40 mg q d,
Singulair 10 mg q d, Aspirin 325 mg q d, Ativan 1 mg q 6
hours prn, Mucomyst nebulizers qid prn, Combivent, Lasix 40
mg q d, [**Last Name (un) **]-Dur 200 mg [**Hospital1 **], Albuterol nebs qid, Atrovent
qid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife who is very
involved in his care.  He also has a daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] has a
positive smoking history.  He smoked 2?????? packs per day for 32
years but quit in [**2154**].  Denies any alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 108,
blood pressure 179/80, respiratory rate 20, satting 89-93% on
40%.  Generally he was breathing comfortably with no
accessory muscles required.  HEENT:  Head was normocephalic,
atraumatic, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light,
extraocular movements intact, sclera anicteric, conjunctiva
clear.  Mouth and oropharynx are without any erythema or
exudates, no thrush.  Neck is supple, no lymphadenopathy, JVP
approximately 8 cm, no hepatojugular reflux, no carotid
bruit, trachea is in place.  Cardiovascular exam, regular
rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds, normal S1 and S2.
Pulmonary exam, he has decreased breath sounds throughout.
Abdomen soft, nontender, non distended with positive bowel
sounds, no fluid wave and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities, he has 2+ pitting edema into his mid shin
bilaterally but symmetric and no calf tenderness.

LABORATORY DATA:  White cell count 17.0, hematocrit 37.2,
platelet count 372,000, PT 10.7, PTT 26.7, INR 0.8, sodium
139, potassium 3.8, chloride 87, CO2 37, BUN 16, creatinine
0.6, glucose 139.  EKG was noted to be normal access, heart
rate of 118 with right atrial enlargement and P pulmonale.
Chest x-ray showed multiple upper lobe bullae with flattened
diaphragms.  There was a linear density extending laterally
from the right hilum as well as a patchy density of the right
base likely chronic with a questionable small right pleural
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 57-year-old man with a history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was admitted to the
MICU with respiratory distress.

1.  Pulmonary:  When he was admitted to the MICU, the patient
required assistance with breathing on the ventilator.
Normally he has been on the ventilator at night, however, he
required it also during the day on admission.  We started him
on Solu-Medrol initially at 80 mg IV q 8 hours.  We also gave
him Albuterol and Atrovent and Mucomyst nebulizers as well as
continued him on Singulair and [**Last Name (un) **]-Dur.  His chest x-ray
showed a linear density ascending laterally from his right
hilum, likely a pneumonic process.  His sputum was sent for
culture and came back positive for pseudomonas.  This is
probably a likely insighting event for his worsening
shortness of breath and respiratory distress.  The patient
did well during his hospital course and was able to wean off
the ventilator during the day onto his home ventilator
settings.  He was discharged requiring three liters of nasal
cannula during the day and his home vent settings at night.

2.  Infectious Disease:  The patient came in very hypoxic
with very thick, green secretions which were sent for culture
and grew out pseudomonas.  The gram stain had more than 25
PMNs and less than 10 epithelial cells and had 4+ gram
positive rods consistent with the pseudomonas.  It was
resistant to Imipenem, however, it was sensitive to
Ceftazidime and Piperacillin.  The patient was initially
started on Levofloxacin 500 mg and Ceftazidime 2 gm q 8
hours, however, when his sensitivities came back he was
switched over to Ceftazidime and Piperacillin.  The patient
will need a total of 14 days of IV antibiotics for his
pneumonia.  PICC line was placed in for his antibiotics.

3.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was initially admitted
tachycardic secondary to respiratory distress.  It was
initially suspected that he might have had cor pulmonale as
an explanation of his lower extremity edema.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram was done to evaluate his RV function.  The
echo showed that his left atrium was normal in size.  His
left ventricular wall thicknesses are also normal.  The left
ventricular systolic function was normal as well.  The aortic
valve leaflets were noted to be mildly thickened as well as
the mitral valve leaflets.  There was a known pericardial
effusion noted.  He was continued on an Aspirin per day.  His
blood pressure was followed closely while in the hospital,
however, he did not require treatment for elevated blood
pressures.

4.  Hematology:  The patient was noted to have a normocytic
anemia.  His iron studies were sent.  His haptoglobin was
noted to be 334, ferritin 220, transferrin 243, TIBC 316,
iron 54, retic count 1.7.  His anemia was felt to be anemia
of chronic disease and his hematocrit was followed while he
was in the hospital and was noted to be stable.

DISPOSITION:  The patient lives at home with his wife,
however, after discussing with the family and the patient, it
was decided a short stay at a rehab facility would be
appropriate for him because his wife is not able to care for
him while he is at home.  He will also need IV antibiotics
for a total of 14 days.  He will be discharged to an acute
rehab facility.  I will dictate an addendum to this discharge
summary to note where the discharge summary should be sent.
I will also dictate patient's medications at a later date.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to rehab facility.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Pneumonia.
