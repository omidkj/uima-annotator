History of Present Illness:
This 72 year old white male with known aortic stenosis(valve
area 1.2 two yrs ago was transferred from an outside hospital
with hematuria. this has been intermittent over the past 2
months, with significant hematuria and  clots over the past 5
days, and feeling extremely weak and lightheaded at the same
time.  He also notes that he has been progressively more
dyspneic over the past 2 months and cannot walk more than 10
feet without becoming extremely winded, as well as worsened
orthopnea, and has been told that this may be due to his aortic
stenosis and fluid in lungs.

He states that he was diagnosed with bladder polyps on
cystoscopy but cardiologist preferred evaluation for aortic
valve repair prior to any urologic procedure.

He  went to the  ED, where they noted deepened lateral ST
depressions, positive enzymes(0.37) and a hematocrit of 18.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.6, BP 117/63, HR 88, RR 20, O2
97% 2L. CXR showed possible pneumonia. EKG: SR 91, IVCD, STD II,

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2109-2-11**]:
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF <30 %). An apical mural left ventricular thrombus is
suggested on 2D imaging, but is NOT confirmed by imaging with
Optison. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. There is a small, partially
echo-filled circumferential pericardial effusion, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-2-9**],
the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
On echocardiogram he was found to have severe aortic stenosis,
pulmonary hypertension  due to left sided diastolic failure, new
wall motion abnormalities over the past 3 weeks with a 35% LVEF
and hypo-akinesis of the mid-distal septum, anterior wall, and
apex not present on previous echo.  He underwent cardiac
catheterization revealing a LAD 90% recannalized occlusion in
the proximal vessel and RCA disease.

He was aggressively diuresed and his breathing improved. A
percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed on the right due to
outflow obstruction from the bladder mass.  Transfusion was
performed to raise the hematocrit to acceptable levels.
His baseline creatinine of was 0.5, on admission here the
creatinine was 1.6.    Because of the suspected prerenal
component, the patient was transfused to >27.0.  Imaging
revealed right sided hydroureteronephorsis for which a
percutaneous nephostomy tube was placed.  This was malpositioned
without drainage, and thus a second one was placed which drained
well.  Of note, the patient was also found to have a duplicated
right ureter.

He underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-5**], transferred to the
CVICu in stable condition on titrated phenylephrine and Propofol
drips. He was extubated in the early AM POD #1 and transferred
to the floor later that day to begin increasing his activity
level.

He was readmitted to the CVICU on POD #2 for rapid atrial
fibrillatoion that resulted in hypotension as well as a tender
abdomen.  General surgery was consulted and diagnosed postop
ileus. Coumadin was restarted for atrial dysr hythmia.
Transferred back to the floor on POD #6.

He was gently diuresed toward his preop weight. Beta blockade
was titrated. He continued to make good progress and was cleared
for discharge to rehab at Baypath Ducksbury on POD #8([**2109-2-14**]) .
All follow up appointments were advised. He will follow up with
his urologist at home for his nephrostomy tube and urologic
issues. His target INR is 2.0-2.5.
