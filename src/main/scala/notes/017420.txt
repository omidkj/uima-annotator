Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p inferior STEMI with IABP placement - transfer from [**Hospital 6451**]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to the right
coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 year old male who presented to [**Hospital3 417**]
with ~90 minutes of chest pain.  Paramedic EKG showed inferior
ST elevations with positive right sided leads.  He was taken
directly to the cath lab, door to balloon time of 14 minutes.
  The patient reports that he was stented approximately 17 years
ago, although he doesn't remember any details of the stents.  He
does report that he has been in good health lately, with no
anginal symptoms and has been leading an active life.  He has
continued to smoke 1-1.5 ppd.  He denies any recent dizziness,
light-headedness, angina/chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, N/V,
abdominal pain
  He received 324mg aspirin as well as 600mg Plavix prior to
cath.  In cath lab, was shown to have 30% proximal disease LAD,
50% stenosis mid adjacent to second diagonal branch, 30%
stenosis further down mid LAD.  30% stenosis in left circumflex
in moderate sized OM-2.  RCA was very large, dominant vessel
with 100% near-ostial occlusion with prior stents in mid RCA.
Expert catheter passed 4 times with removal of significant
thrombus and restoration of normal anterograde flow.  A BMS was
placed in proximal RCA with 0% residual stenosis, 30% old mid
stents and 30% distally.  Continued to have chest pain even with
normal flow, and remained hypotensive on dopamine 20mcg with SBP
in 70s-80s.  Right heart cath showed markedly elevated right and
left sided filling pressures with mean RA pressure of 20mmHG, RV
45/13, PA 45/26, PCW 27mmHg.  A 40cc IABP was placed with
resolution of chest pain and augmented diastolic pressures to
110.  He temporarily went into a fib, dopamine was decreased and
converted back to sinus.  He was given lasix 20mg IV due to
elevated filling pressures.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 y/o male with PMHx of CAD s/p stenting 17 years ago who
presented to [**Hospital3 417**] with inferior STEMI, s/p stenting of
RCA with BMS, IABP placed due to hypotension.  Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

On admission, pt was chest pain free with pressures stable at
100s-110s/70s-80s.  Had IABP placed with good diastolic
augmentation.  He was continued on aspirin 325mg/plavix
75mg/crestor 40mg. Dopamine drip which was started at OSH was
weaned off on [**7-6**].  IABP was removed [**7-7**] and he was started on
metoprolol which was increased to 50 [**Hospital1 **] as well as lisinopril
2.5 mg.  An ECHO was done and showed EF of 35% (official read
below).  We checked HbAiC which was 6.1%.  Patient remained
hemodynamically stable and chest-pain free.  He was seen by PT
and discharged with plan to follow-up with PCP and Cardiology.

ECHO: "The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. moderate regional LV systolic
dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis, and thinned akinetic
anteroseptum. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with focal basal free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with
no aortic stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion. EF = 35%."
