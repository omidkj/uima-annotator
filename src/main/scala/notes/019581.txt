an acutely occluded diagonal branch without stenting.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old male transferred from [**Hospital3 **] in cardiogenic shock after undergoing cardiac
catheterization which revealed an occlusion in his left anterior
descending artery. Patient became hypotensive and bradycardic
requiring intubation and placement of an IABP for hemodynamic
support. He was placed on intravenous Heparin and Nitroglycerin.
Mr. [**Known lastname 48612**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] was also significant for mitral regurgitation,
aortic insufficiency, and dilated ascending aorta. An
echocardiogram on [**2125-9-25**] showed mild aortic insufficiency, mild
aortic stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation and dilated
ascending aortic aneurysm. His LVEF was estimated at 60-65%. He
was admitted directly to the CSRU, intubated and sedated, for
further evaluation and treatment.

[**2125-10-2**] Carotid Ultrasound: Suboptimal study given the presence
of the balloon counterpulsation, however, there does not appear
to be any significant stenosis bilaterally. Likely no stenosis
of the right carotid and less than 40% stenosis of the left
carotid.

[**2125-10-2**] Cardiac Catheterization: Selective left coronary
angiography revealed essentially no change from the diagnostic
angiogram performed prior to transfer except the notable
complete occlusion of the first diagonal branch which was poorly
[**Month/Day/Year 48613**] on outside films.  The 70% mid LAD and 90% proximal
LCX stenoses were unchanged.  The RCA was not injected. The 100%
occluded diagonal branch was crossed with a Choice PT XS wire
and dilated with a 2.0mm balloon.  The wire was exchanged for a
Forte wire through the balloon.  The lesion was then dilated
again with a 2.5x12mm balloon to a maximum of 10atm with very
good POBA results.  There remained a 30% residual with normal
flow and no dissection.

[**2125-10-3**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no significant aortic valve  stenosis but aortic valve
velocities/gradient may have been underestimated. No  aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification with
moderate mitral inflow  gradient. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2125-10-7**] Groin Ultrasound: There is a large fairly anechoic
hematoma in the right groin, with a pseudoaneurysm which is
poorly organized and extending over several centimeters.

[**2125-10-9**] TEE, PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No
atrial septal defect. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function maybe depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

[**2125-10-9**] TEE, POST-BYPASS: Biventricular systolic function
remains preserved in the setting of inotropes. There is a well
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the mitral position.
No significant MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 48613**]. There is a well seated
bioprostheis in the aortic position. It is not well [**Last Name (Titles) 48613**]
however no significant AI is present. The is a tube graft
[**Last Name (Titles) 48613**] in the ascending aorta. Remaining study is unchanged
from prebypass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-2**] after cardiac catheterization arrest
and subsequent resuscitation. Cardiac cath revealed 3VD
w/occluded LAD. Pt was intubated and intra-aortic balloon pump
placed during arrest. After arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] pt sedation
stopped, weaned from ventilator and extubated, pt then found to
have continuing angina and was [**Last Name (un) 4662**] to the cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**]
