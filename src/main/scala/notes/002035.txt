Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T10 TRANSPEDICULAR CORPECTOMY WITH INTERBODY INSTRUMENTED FUSION
T9 TO T11, DEEP BONE BIOPSY, AND POSTERIOR INSTRUMENTED FUSION
T8 TO T12 WITH ALLOGRAFT AND AUTOGRAFT

History of Present Illness:
She had 2 months of progressive back pain radiating to her
bilateral flanks. She was undergoing work up and treatment with
spinal injections but the pain progressed and she developed
bilateral LE weakness so she presented to an OSH ED ([**Location (un) 8641**] in
NH). CT at the OSH reportedly showed a T10 compression lesion
without evidence of cord compression. She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] and
admitted to the ortho spine service for further work up and
treatment. CT C and T spine along with CT torso showed several
masses (lungs, liver, soft tissue and bone) concerning for
metastatic disease; specificially raising suspicion for
melanoma. The patient went to the OR on [**9-4**] in an attempt to
obtain tissue for diagnosis and decompress the T10 mass for pain
relief. There were no clear complications of the surgery but,
post-operatively it was felt that she warrented ICU admission
for monitoring. Her PACU course was notable for 2 hours of low
urine output. She received 500ccs of NS.
.
The patient does report pain in her back and subjective feeling
of SOB. She is nauseous. She denies recent weight change,
fevers, chest pain, abdominal pain. She denies numbness or
tingling.

.
[**2100-9-3**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large 4.6 cm left lower lobe mass concerning for a neoplastic
process. At least two other nodules are identified within the
lungs, one in the left lower lobe and a second in the right
upper lobe.
2. Additional soft tissue lytic lesion in the posterior right
iliac bone.
3. Multiple soft tissue masses, one along the left and right
lateral abdominal wall, and a second in the left labia and
possible third in the left upper chest wall. Lesions are
concerning for neoplastic process. Hypodense lesion in segment
IVb of the liver which is incompletely evaluated but may also
represent a metastatic or neoplastic process.
Conglomerate of findings raises concern for melanoma as a
primary source.
.
[**2100-9-3**] CT T Spine:
IMPRESSION: Large lytic mass infiltrating the T10 vertebral body
and pedicle on the right with resultant severe central canal
stenosis. The effect of this stenosis on the cord are better
evaluated on the comparison MR study.
.
[**2100-9-4**] CXR:
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Left lower lobe retrocardiac
mass is better visualized in prior CT. There is no evident
pneumothorax or pleural
effusions. Increased opacity in the left lower lobe is
consistent with new
atelectasis. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. There is
no overt CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF MICU COURSE:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16968**] was admitted to the MICU for low urine output and
post-op monitoring.  She was noted to have new acute renal
failure, likely due to dehydration and contrast recieved during
the CT scan.  She was given LR boluses x 2 liters for low urine
output.  Her urine output during ICU stay was 15-30cc/hr.  Her
mental status was appropriate.  She recieved morphine for pain
control.  Ortho spine recommended not starting SC Heparin until
72 hours post-op.  She will need a TLSO brace to get out of bed.
 Her hematocrit was trending down from 37 to 28, likely from
blood loss after surgery and dilutional from fluids.  She was
noted to be CO2 retaining after surgery, likely from chronic
COPD and sedation with hypoventilating.  This was improving on
discharge from the ICU.
