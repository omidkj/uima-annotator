Admission Date:  [**2180-1-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-1-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2143-3-3**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIAC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an unfortunate
36-year-old, gravida 2, para 2, [**Location 7979**] speaking female
with a past medical history of sinus venosus ASD, anomalous
pulmonary return and Eisenmenger's physiology, which was
diagnosed in [**2177**]-[**2178**], on home oxygen, who presented with
chest pain and shortness of breath on [**1-18**].

The patient was initially admitted to a medical floor with
oxygen saturations of 88% on 100% nonrebreather.  At the time
of presentation, review of systems was positive for dyspnea
on exertion, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain,
chronic fevers, however, no syncope or palpitations.  The
patient of note, may have had mechanical difficulty with her
home oxygen equipment.

During the initial work-up, a CT angiogram was positive for
progression of her known pulmonary embolus despite a
therapeutic INR.  She was started on Lovenox on the medical
floor.  She was peristently hypoxemic with obvious increased
work of breathing.  The decision was made to see if pulmonary
vasodilators would improve her condition and hemodynamic
assessment was planned in the cardiac catheterization
laboratory.

The patient was brought to the Catheterization Lab on
[**1-21**] for a right heart catheterization. She was noted
initially to become nearly unresponsive on transfer to the scale
for weighing, but spontaneously resolved.  During the
catheterization, her right atrial pressures were noted to be
elevated, right ventricle systolic pressure of 100, pulmonary
arterial pressure of 100-110, mean pulmonary artery pressure in
the 70s.  She had a systemic pAO2 of 25, with a +/- response to a
nitric-oxide trial.  Saturations remained in the 40s to 50s
despite intervention and there profound right to left shunting
continued.

Due to her severe systemic hypoxemia, obvious cardiogenic shock
and worsening hemodynamics, she was transferred to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit where she continued to do rather poorly.  She
was responding to voice but was unable to speak in full
sentences.  Her arterial saturations remained in the 40% range.
Her blood gas returned with a pH of 7.17, CO2 of 41, and a pAO2
of 26.

She did receive some bicarb at that time in an attempt to correct
her acidosis.  CPAP was also initiated to try to increase her
oxygen saturations, and she was also started on Dopamine for
pressor support in an effort to reduce right to left shunt.

She survived throughout the night and was followed by the CCU
Team during the rest of her admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Eisenmenger's diagnosed in [**2178**].
2.  ASD (sinus venosum).  3.  Home oxygen dependent.  4.
Chronic pulmonary embolus secondary to extreme pulmonary
hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:  Oxygen, Coumadin 2 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a single, [**Location 7979**] speaking
woman, who came here about 1?????? years ago.  She is an illegal
alien.  She has two children, boy and an 11-year-old
daughter, who live with her father and step-mother in [**Country **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Question of ASD in father/son.  Primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Company 191**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97??????, blood
pressure 95/52, heart rate 100-130, respirations 30, oxygen
saturation 40-50% on 100% nonrebreather.  General:  Lethargic
and cachectic woman.  HEENT:  JVP at 9-10 cm.  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Oropharynx
dry.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No
wheezes rubs, or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular:  Hyperdynamic.
Right ventricular heave.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  PMI
5-10 cm.  Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurological:
Intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  WBC 10.7, hematocrit 50.9 down from 63 on
admission, platelet count 173; INR 1.8; bicarb 18, sodium
135, potassium 4.1, BUN 10, creatinine 0.6, glucose 87; ALT
12, AST 15, alkaline phosphatase 57, total bilirubin 1;
urinalysis with 26 WBCs, no RBCs; CK of 120, troponin less
than 0.3; HCG quantitative less than 5;

CTA showed increased thickness in extent of mural thrombus
and a markedly dilated proximal pulmonary artery with some
irregularity in the mural thrombus at the bifurcation of the
right pulmonary artery, new small right pleural effusion,
stable, a morphos calcification of the dome of the liver, no
renal stones or abnormal pathology.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 92, right
ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization, abnormal V1-V5,
right axis deviation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 36-year-old female with
Eisenmenger's physiology, chronic pulmonary emboli and chest
pain.  The patient with inarguably significant disease now,
who is status post catheterization confirming anatomy and
increased right-sided pressure.  She became clinically much
worse than on admission with depressed oxygen saturations on
100% nonrebreather, with increased symptoms, increased
lethargy, and dismal ABG.

She had partial response to nitric oxide, and Catheterization
Lab suggested possible response to other vasodilators.  She
was therefore started on Flolan 0.5 ng/kg/min the night of
admission as salvage therapy and was slowly titrated up daily to
3 ng/kg/min.

Supportive measures were also begun including Dopamine drip,
which over the next several days was slowly titrated down to
off, a Heparin drip for her PEs, CPAP/oxygen support, packed
red blood cells to increase to oxygen delivery, and Levaquin
was continued for a urinary tract infection.

She was determined to be CPR not indicated secondary to the
irreversibility of her cardiopulmonary anatomy.

She was followed closely by the Pulmonary Hypertension
Service (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Pharmacy department, the Ethics Service,
Case Management, and further congenital heart disease input via
telephone was obtained from [**Hospital3 1810**].

Her right pleural effusion was monitored closely via exam and
repeat chest x-ray; however, she was always considered too
high risk for diagnostic or therapeutic tap.

Her many social issues were addressed during her stay in the
CCU.  Family members were found and [**Hospital3 653**].  [**Name2 (NI) **] cousin,
[**Name (NI) 36972**] [**Name (NI) 32126**], was deeply involved.  [**Location 36973**] Embassy
and community in [**Location (un) 86**] were also involved in helping with
translation and providing support for the patient.  An
attempt was made to have her daughter and stepmother, who do
not have visas to visit from [**Country 3587**].  The American
Consulate in [**Country 3587**] was consulted who did decline the
request.  This was then pursued by contacting the U.S.
Embassy.

Discussions of how the patient would afford the Flolan and
have the Flolan administered while she was at home was
initiated during this stay.  She was also determined not to
be eligible for a heart/lung transplant secondary to her
illegal immigrant status in the United States.

She remained somewhat stable, although critically ill for
several days.  Her oxygen saturations remained in the 40-50s,
and it was unclear as to whether the Flolan was providing any
clear benefit at this time.

By [**1-24**], her creatinine had begun to increase.  Renal was
consulted and attributed her acute renal failure to
hypotension, as well as recent administration of intravenous
contrast.  Intravenous fluids were limited in order to try to
prevent fluid overload.  A renal ultrasound revealed
hyperechoic kidneys but no overt obstructions.

Her liver function tests, as well as her amylase and lipase
were noted as well to increase, likely consistent with a
shocked pancreas/liver.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound
revealed an enlarged liver with prominent hepatic but patent
veins.

On the morning of [**1-26**] after morning rounds, we were
called in by the nurse who noted that she h
