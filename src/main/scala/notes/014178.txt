Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Cefazolin / Aminophylline

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Left groin infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Excision of distal portion of left axillobifemoral graft and
replacement with interposition left axillary profunda bypass and
left axillary to mid cross-femoral bypass with 8-mm PTFE and
debridement and closure of left groin wound.


History of Present Illness:
This elderly lady has a history of very severe peripheral
vascular disease. She is status post a left axillary bifemoral
graft and right femoral peroneal vein graft. She previously had
a jump graft from the distal left axillary graft to the profunda
femoris artery in [**2106**]. The entire graft occluded about a month
and a half ago when she underwent a thrombectomy in the left
groin. The left groin wound became infected and opened. The
graft was exposed. She developed gram-negative Pseudomonas
infection with bacteremia, is now having removal of the infected
portion of the graft. Both her legs are entirely dependent on
her axillary bifemoral graft and right femoral peroneal bypass
so
the graft must be replaced.

Past Medical History:
1) Peripheral vascular disease
2) s/p right femoral peroneal bypass
3) s/p common femoral artery thrombectomy
4) status post left axillo bifemoral
5) status post profunda
6) status post left
7) ilioprofunda with PTFE
8) aortic insufficiency
9) HTN
10) DM2 diet controlled
11) coronary artery disease
12) status post myocardial infarction
13) status post CABG remote
14) hypothyroidism on no supplement at this time

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)
Reason: assess for infection/obstruction/ileus
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old woman with episode of nausea and vomiting and SOB
today; had infected hematoma at R groin vascular graft site
[**4-26**], with wound vac there now
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for infection/obstruction/ileus
HISTORY: 81-year-old female with episode of nausea and vomiting
and shortness of breath today. Known infected right groin
hematoma. Evaluate for signs of obstruction or ileus.
Comparison is made to prior abdominal radiographs dated [**2108-5-20**] and prior CT dated in [**2108-5-15**].
UPRIGHT AND SUPINE ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPHS
FINDINGS:
Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable without evidence of dilated
large or small bowel. Air is noted distally within the rectum.
No evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Marked degenerative changes of
the spine, calcified gallstones, dense vascular calcifications,
and left common iliac vascular stent are all unchanged. Surgical
clips are noted over the left femoral neck.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of bowel obstruction or ileus.

CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: r/o PNA, effusion, pulm edema
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81F with sudden onset SOB, crackles at R base, N/V
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PNA, effusion, pulm edema
HISTORY: 81-year-old female with sudden onset shortness of
breath and right basilar crackles. Evaluate for pneumonia,
effusion, or pulmonary edema.
Comparison is made to prior radiographs dated [**5-21**] and [**2108-5-28**].
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
FINDINGS:
Mild interstitial edema persists and may be slightly improved
from most recent radiograph as does small bilateral pleural
effusions (right greater than left). No new focal parenchymal
infiltrates are identified, and there is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly
enlarged and there is stable appearance to median sternotomy
wires and left- sided PICC catheter, which terminates in the
upper SVC. Chronic changes involving the left glenohumeral joint
are stable.
IMPRESSION:
Persistent mild bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema at the
lung bases with small bilateral pleural effusions.
