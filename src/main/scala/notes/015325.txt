[**Hospital Unit Name 92800**]: History of Present Illness: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo
female with hx of chronic renal failure, diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, glaucoma,
arthritis, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
Levofloxacin who presents from medicine floor due to an increase
in oxygen requirement, confusion, somnolence, and lethargy.  She
was originally admitted to the medicine floor with an acute
onset SSCP 3 days prior to current admission.  Cadiac enzymes
have been negative. Nuclear stress test done [**2138-10-30**] showed
moderate fixed inferior wall defect exteding to the apex with
normal function and ventricular size with LVEF of 60%.  No
anginal symptoms or ischemic ST changes were noted.  Patient
continues to complain of diffuse pains in lieu of her chronic
pain syndrome, mainly at the site of her left arm keloid.
.
On day of admission, patient was noted to have an increasing O2
requirement, satting in low 90s on 3L, and was noted to be more
lethargic, confused, and somnolent.  An urgent CXR was done
which revealed large pleural effusion.  She has remained
afebrile with no cough.  Respiratory therapy was called and ABG
revealed 7.28/72/116.  Lasix 100mg IV x1 was ordered and she was
transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ventilatory monitoring.
.
Her vitals on transfer were: T97.2, BP 150/80, HR 101, RR 20,
sat 88% on 2L.
.
On the floor, another ABG was acquired, which revealed
7.21/85/60, at which point, she was intubated by anesthesia.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2138-10-30**]):
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.

EKG: Marked baseline artifact. The rhythm is regular and appears
to be sinus bradycardia, rate 120. Poor R wave progression.
Marked left axis deviation. Left anterior hemiblock. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2138-5-30**] the rate has increased from 98
to 121 and there are some non-specific ST-T wave changes but no
other diagnostic interim change.

Repeat EKG: Compared to tracing #1 no diagnostic interim change
other than
slowing of the rate.

CXR IMPRESSION: Bibasilar air opacities, worsened compared to
the prior study with worsening bilateral pleural effusion. These
finding could be seen in pneumonia, or atelectasis. Please
correlate with clinical symptoms.

Cardiac Stress: IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST
segment changes. Nuclear report sent separately.
Nuclear:  IMPRESSION: Moderate fixed inferior wall defect
extending to the apex. Normal fucntion and ventricular size.
LVEF:60%

Brain MRI ([**11-7**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct.
Small vessel disease. Soft tissue changes in the ethmoid and
sphenoid sinuses could be related to intubation.

Brain MRA ([**11-7**]): IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on
MRA of the head.

CT Head ([**11-6**]): IMPRESSION: No new intracranial hemorrhage. MR
is more sensitive in the detection of acute stroke.
