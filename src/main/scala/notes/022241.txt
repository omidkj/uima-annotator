MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2152-10-27**]):    No MRSA isolated.

ECHO:

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= XX
%). Diastolic function could not be assessed. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated, hypokinetic right
ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation and at least
moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Small circumferential
effusion without evidence of tamponade.

CXR:

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
unchanged evidence of moderate bilateral pleural effusions and
bilateral basal atelectasis.

Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. The right internal jugular vein
catheter has not been pulled back, its tip still projects over
the right atrium. To ensure position within the superior vena
cava, the line should be pulled back by 9 cm.

Unchanged appearance of a small right upper lobe atelectasis.

When she was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative
care, she was transfered to floor status
