History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old gentleman with a past medical
history notable for hypertension, ESRD on dialysis, CHF, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, recent MRSA bacteremia on vancomycin,
CAD s/p CABG and LAD stenting, and past CVA who presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2168-9-12**] from his renal dialysis facility because of
change in mental status. Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been admitted
approximately once per month since [**1-/2168**] for [**Year (4 digits) **], CHF,
sepsis, and line infections. His most recent hospital admission
to the [**Hospital1 18**] was from [**2168-9-6**] to [**2168-9-8**] for CHF in the setting
of poorly controlled hypertension. The patient was discharged on
[**2168-9-8**] to his nursing home facility where, per report from
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32726**] at the home, the patient returned to his baseline
state of health. Mr. [**Known lastname **] did well until the evening prior to
admission, when the staff found him to be shouting more than
normal. At baseline, the patient shouts infrequently in his
native Creole language, but the staff noted that he was shouting
more frequently last night; they also note that he seemed more
confused than normal. In addition, Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not sleep much
on the evening prior to admission. He denied any pain symptoms
when questioned by the staff. On the morning of admission, the
patient was taken to dialysis at [**Location (un) **] Dialysis where he
screamed continuously and held his groin area (the site of a
femoral line). Due to concern about the patient's change in
mental status and possible pain at the femoral line site, he did
not undergo his dialysis treatment and was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**]
emergency department for evaluation.
.
In the ED, the patient's vital signs were: T 95.5, HR 90, BP
158/98, RR 16, O2Sat 99/RA. The patient underwent a CT of the
head and chest x-ray. The CXR showed chronic LLL consolidation,
RLL consolidation that had been noted on the previous admission
and has not yet resolved, as well as small bilateral pleural
effusions. The CT of the head showed no acute intracranial
pathology. The patient was given 1 gram of ceftazidime, 1 gram
of vancomycin, epoetin, 5 mcg of paricalcitol, 62.5 mg of ferric
gluconate. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to be hyperkalemic and to have
an INR of 1.3. Given the persistence of the RLL consolidation,
the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 139**] general medical service
for work-up of his mental status change and treatment of
pneumonia.
.
Review of Systems: Per report from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32726**] at the Nursing
Home, the patient has not had any recent cough, fever, nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea. She says that his blood pressure, heart
rate, and oxygen saturation have all been normal over the last
several days.
.
MICU Txfer:
Reason for transfer: Bradyacardia and AMS
.
During his hospitalization, his mental status improved on
antibiotics. He was initially treated with Levo/Flagyl, changed
to Cefepime and Tobramycin and Flagyl when his cultures grew out
Enterobacteriae; subsequently this was changed to Meropenem as
it was felt that he may have an ESBL organism.
.
On [**2168-9-18**], patient was alert and conversing with team. On
[**2168-9-19**], patient was found to be unresponsive/lethargic and
bradycardic to the 40s. He was in Afib and did not have any
changes on his EKG. His pressure was in the 90s at this heart
rate. His finger sticks were normal. He was afebrile. His last
nodal agents was 9pm on [**2168-9-18**] (he is on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **])
and his last sedatives were olanzapine at 10am on [**2168-9-18**] and
trazodone at 9pm on [**2168-9-18**]. On the floor, he was given atropine
x 2 and his heart rate increased to 60s after 1st atropine and
his BP increased to the 110s. However, his mentation did not
improve. CT of head showed ?stroke, but Neuro consulted and felt
not c/w pt presentation.
.
On Transfer to floor from MICU:
Summary of MICU course--The episode of AMS that brought him to
the MICU was accompanied by bradycardia and hypotension. He was
started on dopamine; as his HR and BP picked up so did his
mentation. Neuro was consulted about a finding of possible
stroke on CT which they felt was not clinically consistent with
his physical exam.
.
His vitals signs were stable and mental status improved and he
was called out to floor.
