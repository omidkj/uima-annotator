Service:  Vascular

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral lower extremity discomfort; left
greater than right over the past several months with pain at
rest and pain with ambulation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is wheelchair bound
and has had a myocardial infarction in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year with
an ejection fraction is 20% to 25%.  An echocardiogram in
[**Month (only) 205**] demonstrated global hypokinesis with 1+ aortic
insufficiency and 2+ mitral regurgitation.  He did undergo an
angioplasty at that time of his right coronary artery with
stenting.  The native vessel disease showed irregularities in
the left main trunk.  There was no left anterior descending
artery disease.  The first diagonal was 60% stenosed.  There
was a large branching ramus intermedius which was normal.
The circumflex was very short and immediately gave rise to
the atrial circumflex artery and branching obtuse marginal.
The lower pole of the first obtuse marginal was occluded and
filled via left-to-left collaterals.  The dominant artery was
the right coronary artery which was severely diseased.  It
had a long proximal 90% tubular stenosis and a 60% ablation
and an 85% lesion involving the medial right coronary artery
with a distal right coronary artery lesion of 40%.

The patient is now admitted for further vascular evaluation
and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Chronic anemia.
4.  Gout.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial
infarction; status post congestive heart failure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortobifemoral bypass 15 years ago.
2.  Bilateral femoral-popliteal bypass in the past.
3.  Left carotid endarterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission
included)
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Moexipril 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Prednisone 60 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 50-pack-year smoking
history.  He denies alcohol use since last hospitalized in
[**2167-7-27**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed vital signs were stable.  General appearance
revealed alert and oriented times three.  In no acute
distress.  Chest examination was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  No
murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdominal examination revealed
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity examination
revealed left foot was cool and tender to palpation.  Pulse
examination on the left showed the femoral and popliteal
pulses were palpable.  The dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis pulses were nonpalpable.  On the right, the femoral
pulse was palpable.  The popliteal was palpable.  There was
dopplerable signal of the dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis pulses on the right.  The patient refused a rectal
examination.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Admission
laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 5.1,
hematocrit was 33.7, and platelet count was normal.
Prothrombin time and INR were normal.  Blood urea nitrogen
was 39 and creatinine was 2.1.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm
with an atrioventricular conduction delay.  Prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction.  When compared with
previous tracings of [**2168-1-8**] there were no changes.

A chest x-ray was unremarkable for congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular
Service.  He was begun on an intravenous heparin drip.  His
coagulation parameters were monitored, and his goal INR was
between 60 and 80.  Intravenous hydration and Mucomyst
preparation was begun because of his chronic renal
insufficiency.

The patient underwent an arteriogram.  This demonstrated
bilateral femoral-popliteal bypass grafts were intact.  The
abdominal aorta showed mildly diseased suprarenal aorta.  The
left renal artery which had previously received
endarterectomy was widely patent; although, there was a
fibrinous probable hyperplastic intima at the renal artery
midportion prior to its bifurcation.  There was a visible
nephrogram on that side.  The renal artery on the right was
substantially higher, and there were two lesions with
approximately 50% to 60% stenosis in the artery of post
stenotic dilatation.  The nephrogram was visualized on that
side.  The celiac axis and superior mesenteric arteries were
both patent.  There was a previously placed aortobifemoral
graft which was widely patent without evidence of thrombosis
or stenosis of either arteries.  There was no left common
femoral artery, and the left limb of the aortobifemoral was
anastomosed to the profunda femoris.  Along the branch of the
profunda femoris, there were multiple stenoses of 99%.  The
bypass graft was visualized coming off the profunda, and
there was no evidence of stenosis proximally.  It traveled
through the upper and lower thigh at the level of the knee.
The bypass was anastomosed to the below-knee popliteal
artery.  Approximately 60% narrowing was noted at this point.
Distally, there was a patent reconstructed anterior tibial.
Anterior tibial constitutes runoff to the ankle which
perfused the dorsalis pedis which promptly occludes 4 cm.
However, there was a small tarsal branch visualized prior to
determination.  There was reconstitution of a very small
peroneal artery which filled all collaterals which go to the
heel.  The arch was incomplete.

The patient's creatinine remained stable status post
angioplasty.  Cardiology was requested for risk assessment.
They felt there was no need for any interventional or
diagnostic cardiac studies since the patient had been
recently revascularized, and that he should be treated for
any susceptible congestive heart failure and maintained with
a systolic blood pressure in the 120s to 130s.  Other
recommendations were to add and aspirin after there was no
surgical contraindication.

The patient proceeded to surgery on [**2168-1-13**].  He
underwent a left femoral to distal anterior tibial bypass
jump graft from the lower end of the previous saphenous vein
femoral-popliteal bypass to the distal anterior tibial artery
using right arm vein, cephalic and basilic loop partially
valve optimized.

He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.
Postoperatively, he was hemodynamically stable.  His x-ray
was without pneumothorax.  Electrocardiogram was without
acute changes.  His hematocrit was 29.1.  Blood urea nitrogen
was 42.  Creatinine was 1.9.  Otherwise, he received
hydrocortisone stress perioperatively.

On postoperative day one, there were no overnight events.
His hematocrit was 42.7 on postoperative day one.  His wounds
were clean, dry, and intact.  His pulse examination was
unchanged.  A hydrocortisone taper was begun.  His
preoperative medications were instituted.  His diet was
advanced as tolerated.  He remained in the Vascular Intensive
Care Unit.  Cardiology followed the patient perioperatively.

On postoperative day two, there were no overnight events.
His hematocrit was 30.  His pulmonary artery line was
converted to central venous line.  His arterial line was
discontinued, and he was transferred to the regular nursing
floor.

On postoperative day three, there were no overnight events.
His Foley catheter was discontinued, and he had no difficulty
voiding.  He continued to do well.  He was seen by Physical
Therapy who felt that the patient would be able to be
discharged to home.  The patient was ambulating by
postoperative day four and was de-lined.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home on
[**2168-1-18**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] in two weeks' time.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  He was discharged with adjustments
in his antihypertensive medications.
1.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Moexipril 30 mg
