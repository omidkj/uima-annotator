Brief Hospital Course:

[**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 1092**] surgery. She was also evaluted by
intervention pulmonology (IP) and oncology.  Oncology felt
systemic treatment would be a little benefit. Also, IP felt that
stent placement would be two high risk a procedure to undertake
especially if no other treatment would reduce her tumor burden.
Therefore the patient's grave prognosis was explained to her and
her husband.  They were overwhelmed but understood, and stated
the desire to home with family.  A DNR/DNI order was placed, a
palliative care consult was obtained, and home hospice was
arranged.  On [**7-27**] the patient was discharged from the SICU to
her home with hospice.
