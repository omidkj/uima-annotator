.
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 9950**] is a 78 y/o woman with PMH of CAD s/p CABG,
hypertension, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin wh presents
after a mechanical fall at rehab. Patient has been at Tower [**Doctor Last Name **]
Rehab center following a presumed embolic stroke in [**2127-1-7**]
(see d/c summary for details). Yesterday morning, the patient
sustained a fall onto her left side per her report. The patient
denies any symptoms of chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness,
or palpitations prior to the fall. She remembers leaning against
the wall and the walker that she was using not being in front of
her. She fell onto her left side but did not strike her head.
She did not lose consciousness. She reports that she was not
confused following the fall and recalls being put back into bed.
She experienced pain after the fall and could not ambulate.
X-ray done at the facility showed ? femoral neck fracture so she
was then taken to the hospital for further evaluation.
.
Initial vitals on arrival to our emergency room were T 98.4, HR
72, BP 118/66, 97% (O2 unknown). X-ray of the left hip
demonstrated a femoral fracture; the patient was evaluated by
orthopedics but due to supratherapeutic INR and acute on chronic
renal failure, she is admitted to medicine. For pain, she was
treated with morphine 4 mg IV X 1 at 2230. She received 1 L NS.
CT head demonstrated no acute hemorrhage. Of note, oxygen
saturations noted to be 97-98% on RA while patient was in ED.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is complaining of pain with
any movement of her leg. She denies chest pain, difficulty
breathing, dizziness/lightheadness, or palpitations.

.
EKG: A-V paced at 60, LBBB with left axis, compared to prior,
pacing is new, QTc 512 (old 450 but at higher rate)
.
CXR: Right upper lobe opacity which is relatively stable in
comparison to studies from [**2127-1-7**]. At that time, this was
presumed pneumonia; however, no intervening radiographs are
available to document a complete resolution. This may represent
recurrent pneumonia or possibly the progression of an indolent
growing bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma. Chest CT is recommended
for further evaluation as clinically indicated. There may be an
element of superimposed mild edema.
.
Left hip x-ray: Fracture of the base of the left femoral neck
with no definite trochanteric involvement.
.
Head CT: 1. No acute intracranial process. Specifically, no
evidence of hemorrhage. 2. Interval evolution of right middle
cerebral artery territory infarct.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78yo Russian speaking woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, chronic
diastolic CHF with EF 55%, afib on coumadin, s/p CVA x 2, DM who
presented s/p fall with L femoral fracture now s/p
hemiarthroplasty who was transferred to he MICU with hypoxia and
hypotension in pACU immediately following surgery.
.
1. MICU Admission for hypotension/hypoxia- Post-operatively
patient became hypoxic after receiving 1 litre of fluid and 2
units of FFP on the day of the procedure.  She received
furosemide bolus 20mg IV and then developed hypotension with
systolic in the 70s, with urine output below 20cc/hr.  She was
transiently on neosynephrine which was stopped on morning of
[**2127-3-2**].  While in the MICU, she required 3 250 cc boluses for
SBP below 90 or urine output less than 20.  Workup for
infectious sources revealed Gram negative rods in urine culture
and patient was started on ciprofloxacin for this.  Her oxygen
requirement improved with the initial diuretics and remained
stable prior to floor transfer.  She did receive 1 unit of PRBC
for fall in hematocrit. Her UCx came back with pan-sensitive E
coli to be treated with Cipro for five more days. Her BB and
home lasix were held and should be restarted as tolerated after
discharge.
.

2. UTI: pt with positive UA. Pt febrile to 102 on arrival to
PACU, however resolved to 100 without intervention. WBC jumped
to 16 however on recheck returned to 8.5. Replaced foley
catheter on arrival to MICU. Started empiric ciprofloxacin. Her
UCx came back with pan-sensitive E coli to be treated with Cipro
for five more days.
.
3. Afib: Pt on amio and BB as outpt. Held BB given hypotension
but pt was continued on amio and was monitored on telemetry. Pt
on coumadin with INR goal of [**3-10**].5 given 2 CVAs while
anticoagulated. She was on a heparin drip and restarted on her
coumadin on day of discharge. INR should be checked daily given
multiple medical interactions (amio, cipro) and coumadin dose to
be adjusted as needed. Heparin drip can be discontinued once
stable INR in therapeutic range for two days.
.
4. L hip fracture s/p hemiarthroplasty: Pt was followed by
ortho. VAC was placed post-op and needs to be discontinued on
Sunday [**6-3**]. Pt received morphine IV prn pain and vancomycin x 2
doses peripoeratively per ortho recs. Pt needs to follow up with
ortho 14 days after the operation for staples removal. Weight
bearing as tolerated with anterior hip precautions.
.
5. Chronic diastolic CHF with EF 55%: Held home BB and lasix
dose (20po qday) during hypotensive episode. Should be retarted
as tolerated after discharge.
.
6. CAD s/p CABG: stable at present. Pt was ruled out for MI. Not
on ASA at baseline for unclear reasons, to be clarified as
outpatient with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was continued on her statin. Held
BB as above.
.
7. DM II: Pt is diet controlled as outpt. Followed qid FS and
kept on ISS.
.
8. ARF: On admission pt with Cr 1.8 from baseline 1.2. This has
improved during her stay, likely prerenal in origin. Cr was back
at baseline of 1.2 on discharge.
.
9. Chronic RUL infiltrate: present since 1/[**2126**]. Needs to be
followed up as outpatient as concerning for possible carcinoma.
Pt likely needs outpatient CT for further workup.
.
10. FEN: Repleted lytes prn. Kept transiently NPO. Cleared by
speech/swallow to received pills crushed in purree and nectar
thick liquids.
.
11. PPX: heparin drip, PPI, bowel regimen
.
12. Access: R IJ placed under sterile conditions in PACU by
anesthesiology on [**4-30**]. R radial A-line.
