resection of metastatic tumor ([**5-19**]). He is currently on
taxotere chemotherapy, most recent dose on [**7-15**] which is cycle 6
for him and continued whole brain XRT for his brain mets. Was
recently admitted to OMED service on [**6-20**] for 6days with exact
similar presentation of cough and shortness of breath and had
just completed his steroid taper for brain mets when symptoms
recurred.  There does not seem to be increasing exertional
dyspnea or a h/o orthopnea.  Pt also notes some chest pressure
at rest which he has experienced before -- he took oxycodone
which relieved the sx.  Pt says his sx improved yesterday PM and
today AM without any intervention.  Pt denies fever/chills,
orthopnea/PND, current chest pain/pressure, n/v/d.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to OMED from the ED.  Pt was started on bactrim
in addition to his ceftriaxone and azithromycin, as it was felt
that his recent steroid taper might have predisposed him to PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].  Albuterol/ipratropium nebs were started for COPD
relief, however steroids were initially held given possible
immunosuppressed state (recent steroids, possible PCP).  On the
day following admission, in the AM pt looked better less
respiratory distress and tachypnea.  However, as the day
progressed, Mr. [**Known lastname **] became increasingly dyspneic and
experienced desaturations into the mid-low 80's, and the patient
was admitted to the ICU where his nebs were continued, steroids
added on (inhaled and systemic, the latter for a 2-week course),
and antibiotics changed to ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and
vancomycin given possible postobstructive pneumonia with sputum
cx growing out coag + staphylococci.  Pt stabilized in the ICU
and was called out to the floor where he remained tachypneic but
appeared less symptomatic, with main complaint being copious
sputum production that was difficult to clear.  The results came
back from the sputum cx, showing pcn-resistance, so vancomycin
was continued.  Final culture results revealed MRSA and no PCP;
vancomycin was continued, and pt was placed on MRSA precautions.
 For sputum, started aggressive chest PT, guaifenisen, and
mucomyst.  Pt continued to require 5L O2 by nasal cannula, but
appeared clinically improved from a respiratory standpoint.
Aggressive chest PT was pursued, which also helped, per report
of pt.  A PICC was placed in anticipation of pt's dispo to a
pulmonary rehabilitation facility to finish vancomycin course.
