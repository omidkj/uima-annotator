Pertinent Results:
------------------
IMAGING:
-----------------
CT Head(POST-OP) [**3-29**]:
INDICATION: 73-year-old woman status post right craniotomy.
Please evaluate for postoperative bleeding.

COMPARISON: MR of the head of [**3-29**], performed earlier in the
morning and CT of the head, [**2143-3-26**].

TECHNIQUE: Axially-acquired images were obtained through the
head without
contrast.

FINDINGS: The patient is status post right frontal craniectomy.
A small
amount of extra-axial fluid is noted overlying the dura. Tiny
foci of
hyperdensities are seen, consistent with expected minimal
postoperative
hemorrhage. There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Pneumocephalus is
overlying the right frontal lobe causing mild mass effect. There
is
persistent leftward shift of midline structures of approximately
5-6 mm,
unchanged. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration.
There is
preservation of the normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.

IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative changes from right frontal
craniectomy.  Persistent leftward shift of midline structures of
[**4-18**] mm.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



MRI Head(POST-op) [**3-30**]:
EXAM: MRI brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient is status post craniotomy.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and
diffusion
axial images were obtained before gadolinium. T1 axial and
MP-RAGE sagittal images acquired following gadolinium.
Comparison was made with the MRI of [**2143-3-29**].

FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the previously identified
intra- and
extracranial mass has been resected. Fluid level seen in the
scalp in this
region, a craniotomy defect is identified. There is some
meningeal
enhancement seen. There is no residual nodular enhancement
identified. There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus. No acute
infarct.

IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right frontal lobe mass. No
residual
nodular area of enhancement is seen. No acute infarct.

CT Torso [**2143-3-30**];

FINDINGS:

CTEST:

Evaluation of the lungs demonstrate a large confluent mass in
the left upper lobe with heterogeneous enhancement and prominent
interstitial thickening that involves both the left upper lobe
and a smalll part of the superior segment left lower lobe.
Additionally, in the left neck, a heterogeneous conglomeration
of soft tissue is identified which between the left common
carotid artery and left jugular vein. This constellation of
findings are highly suspicious for consolidative metastatic mass
with lymphangitic spread of cancer versus lymphatic obstruction
within the lung, and lymph node involvement in the neck.
Evaluation of the neck is however, limited since this exam is
not tailored for this evaluation. A small left pleural effusion
is present. The left upper lobe bronchus is obliterated by the
dominant mass; however, the branches to the lingula and left
lower lobe bronchi are patent though some extrinsic narrowing of
the left lower lobe bronchus may be present. The right lung is
essentially clear. Minimal layering debris is identified within
the trachea.

The brachiocephalic veins, superior vena cava, and visualized
inferior vena cava appear unremarkable. Atherosclerotic changes
are noted within the aorta. No aneurysm is identified. The
pulmonary arterial trunk, central major branches, and segmental
branches do not demonstrate any intraluminal defect to suggest
pulmonary embolism. The heart is not enlarged. No pericardial
effusion is identified.

ABDOMEN:

A small paraesophageal hernia is identified. The stomach, small
bowel, colon and appendix is normal. The liver, gallbladder,
spleen and adrenal glands are within normal limits. The pancreas
is atrophic.

Simple cysts and lesions too small to characterize but probably
cysts are seen in both kidneys. The largest is identified in the
left lower pole measuring 3.2 cm. The largest on the right is
also in the lower pole measuring 1.7 cm.  Nonspecific
calcifications are seen in the right kidney which has a linear
morphology and most likely are vascular in nature.

PELVIS:

The bladder is decompressed and a Foley catheter is present
limiting its
evaluation. The uterus and adnexal structures are within normal
limits.

Right mastectomy changes are noted. Marked S-shaped scoliosis of
the spine is present. There is fusion of the mid thoracic
vertebral bodies with some loss of height anteriorly. No osseous
metastases identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Left upper lobe and left lower lobe confluent heterogeneous
enhancing mass with interstitial lung thickening consistent with
metastatic disease probably with lymphangitic spread.

2. Left neck soft tissue mass incompletely evaluated on this
study; however, highly suspicious for shotty adenopathy.

3. Small periesophageal hernia.

4. No liver lesions are identified.

5. Severe scoliosis of the thoracic and lumbar spine with
congenital
abnormalities.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 73F electively admitted to NSURG on [**3-29**] for a
right frontal craniotomy for mass resection, and frontal
cranioplasty. Intraoperatively, her NA had dropped to the low
120s, this was corrected intraop to a NA of 128.
Post-operatively, she was returned to the ICU for q1h
neurochecks, and monitoring of her Na. She was transferred to
the floor and evaluated by PT who felt she could go home without
assistance.  She agrees with this plan. She was instructed that
she may resume her antihypertensive medication. She is refusing
to follow up with thoracic surgery for her lung mass but has
their phone number if she chooses to do so.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
YOU [**Month (only) **] RESUME YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION
WOUND CARE:
??????	You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and
report any of the following problems to your physician.
??????	Keep your incision clean and dry.
??????	You may wash your hair with a mild shampoo 24 hours after your

DIET
Usually no special diet is prescribed after a craniotomy. A
normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you
should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating
before your surgery.  Be sure however, to remain well hydrated,
and increase your consumption of fiber, as pain medications may
cause constipation.
