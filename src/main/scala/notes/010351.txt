History of Present Illness:
77 yo male with history of hypogammaglobulinemia, lymphoma s/p
CHOP and asthma, who presents with SOB. Beginning on [**Name (NI) 766**], pt
started "not feeling well." He describes SOB, that became worse
such that he had SOB even with just slow walking, and was unable
to walk upstairs without becoming SOB. Then Weds night, SOB
became worse, and he was unable to sleep lying down, and had to
sit up. He saw at doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2274**] on Thurs, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12997**], who
ordered CXR, ECG and looked at a prior echo. He says she was
concerned about possible heart failure and gave him 20mg lasix
to take. He took 2 doses, and thinks it helped initially.
However, pt was again unable to sleep last night, had to sit
straight up, endorses PND. He normally sleeps on 1 pillow. He
denies any chest pain, but has had some pressure this week, no
change with inspiration, his symptoms are making him very
anxious.  He has also noticed some palpitations in the past few
days. He denies fever, chills or cough. Denies any pedal edema
but did ntice increasing abdominal girth and decreased appetite.
He says he has had PNA before but this feels diferent. He has
occasional asthma, and says albuterol has helped some, but not
completely. He denies any leg swelling. He denies any long trips
and does not smoke. He denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
urinary syx, bloody or black stools.
.
Pt was initially diagnosed with LBBB in [**2186**].  He had a TTE in
[**2187**] as part of the work-up which showed EF 40% and inferior
wall hypokinesis.  Per his report, he was told that no further
work-up was needed at that time. Pt also reports several years
of intermittent palpitation.  He reports wearing what sounds
like [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor, which did capture some events,
but he was told they were due to an anti-histamine he was on and
had no further workup.
.
On presentation, pt vital signs 97.2 89 135/79 22 100%.  He
received lasix 20mg IV in the ED with UOP of almost 2 L. Labs
were significant for neg trop x1, proBNP 3690, WBC 11.8 with 55%
lymph, 40% neutrophils.  His ECHO showed LVEF of 20% with severe
regional LV hypokinesis.  Pt was noticed to flip into afib in
the ED with HR up to 140s, he received lopressor 25mg PO.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient reports his symptoms have
improved, though he still feels uncomfortable when lying down.
He remains in afib with rates 100-120s. He is asymptomatic, no
lightheadedness or dizziness.

HYPOGAMMAGLOBULIMEMIA, UNSPEC
CLL/lymphoma [**2170**] rx'din [**2175**] 6 cycles of CHOP. The first 3 with
Rituxan due to a rapid rise in his blood counts. In [**2181**], rx'd
CVP without Rituxan because of worsening disease and in [**2182**]
rx'd with fludarabine. Rx'd gamma glob for recurrent sinus and
pulm infections. Premed with steroids, demerol for rigors.
[**3-13**]; Restaging abd CT scan showed minimal adenopathy
[**6-10**]: Chest CT showed stable small pulm nodules, small nodes.
