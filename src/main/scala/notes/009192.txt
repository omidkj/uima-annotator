Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension/ atrial fibrillation with RVR.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH CHF, PAF, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], SIADH who
presented to ED with decreased po intake. Pt was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2135-11-2**] after being hospitalized for
hyponatremia, altered MS, and CHF. Per caregiver, pt was well
until 2 d prior to admission(day of d/c) when pt "just looked
much worse." More confused and significantly decreased po
intake. Per caregiver, no [**Name2 (NI) **], fevers, increased leg swelling,
or notable increased SOB.
.
In ED, CXR showed increased large bilateral pleural effusion.
Head CT was negative for acute process. Pt with HR up to 150s on
telemetry in rapid a fib and SBP dropped to 80s. Pt given 750 cc
NS in ED in boluses for hypotension with no improvement in HR.
Pt then given 10 mg IV Diltiazem for rapid a fib with decreased
HR.  The patient was then transferred to the unit for futher
management. The patient was diuresed 1L with 10 mg IV lasix with
improved respiratory function clinically. Diltiazem was
discontinued and rate control was done via titrating metoprolol
with good effect. Pending stability, patient was tranferred to
floor.

Studies During Admission:
1. ED Head [**2135-11-4**] CT: benign
2. ED CXR [**2135-11-4**]:There are large bilateral pleural effusions
with associated atelectasis and obscuration of the lung bases.
Heart size cannot be assessed. No overt vascular congestion at
this time. The visualized lungs show no focal consolidations.
Since single frontal radiograph eight days ago ([**2135-10-27**]),
the pleural effusions have increased slightly in size with
otherwise little change.
Large increasing bilateral pleural effusions without overt CHF
at this time.
3. MICU CXR [**2135-11-5**]: Again noted is a small to moderate-sized
left pleural effusion, which is not significantly changed since
the previous exam. Opacity at the right base is slightly
improved since the prior exam. Again demonstrated are increased
interstitial changes bilaterally, most likely related to chronic
CHF. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There is aortic
atherosclerosis. The upper and mid lung fields are clear of
focal consolidation. Findings consistent with elevated pulmonary
venous pressures and pleural effusions, the right pleural
effusion has slightly improved since the prior exam.
 4. CTA [**2135-11-7**] on suspicion of PE: negative
Upper and Lower Extremity US for DVT: negative
3. EKG Results [**2135-11-5**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response and ventricular premature beats. Poor R
wave progresion, probable normal variant. Inferolateral T wave
changes are non-specific. Repolarization changes may be due in
part, to rate/rhythm. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads.
Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2135-11-5**] no significant change
5. ECHO [**2135-11-8**] The left and right atrium are markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall  thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%).  [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function may be more depressed given the  severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right  ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of  tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for
tamponade physiology.  Compared with the prior study (tape
reviewed) of [**2135-10-27**], the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F with PMH diastolic CHF, PAF, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], SIADH who returns 2
days post discharge for failure to thrive/ hypotension/ AFib
with RVR at rehab.

Systems based description:
Pulmonary: Consulted pulmonary about pulmonary HTN. PHTN was
thought to be secondary to longstanding MR. Viagra was was
contraindicated because of low blood pressure.
No therapeutic options were available to treat PHTN.

Cardiology: Cardiology suggested rate control with diltiazem as
monotherapy as long as possible.  Other suggested potentially
adding amiodarone to regimen. Pulmonary was comforatable with
this suggestion.  Advised light diuresis to address edema with
caustion about reflex tachycardia with more aggresive diuresis.
Advised low salt diet for CHF and  continued fluid restriction
to address hyponatremia. Heart rate was not adquately controled
with diltiazem on Friday [**2135-11-10**] the patient and her family
elected to have an atrial sinus ablation with a pacemaker
placement.

Pallative Care: The pacemaker did not signficantly improve the
patient's hemodynamic state.  The patient and family elected to
have [**Month/Day/Year **] measures only on [**2135-11-15**].  The patient had
previously been DNR/DNI.  All medications (antidepressants,
cardiac, diuretics) were discontinued.  The patient was started
on PO morphine which progressed to concentrated morphine and
then a morphine drip on [**2135-11-18**].  Morphine was given only to
make the patient comfortable and was held for respiratory
depression.  The patient expired on [**2135-11-19**] on Saturday evening
due to advanced congestive heart failure (specificaly pulmonary
congestion).  The family consented to an autospy.
