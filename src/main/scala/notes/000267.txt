Chief Complaint:
Acute renal failure

Angiography of lower limbs


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28624**] is a 79 year old male with past medical history of
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, COPD, and
diabetes mellitus who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management after being found to have hyperkalemia, worsening
renal function, and hypotension.
.
He presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] today after being
referred there when routine laboratory draw revealed
abnormalities. His potassium was found to be 6.1, and creatinine
4.7. Blood pressure there was noted to be 83/42. He was given an
albuterol nebulizer, 1 amp of calcium gluconate, 10 units of
regular insulin, 1 amp of D50, and 30 mg of kayexalate, as well
as 500 cc of normal saline.
.
In the ED here at [**Hospital1 18**], initial vital signs were: blood
pressure of 91/54, heart rate of 76, respiratory rate of 22, and
oxygen saturation of 90%. A right femoral central line was
placed for initiation of pressors, and he was started on neo. He
was given 1 gram of vancomycin and 4.5 grams of zosyn for
possible urinary tract infection. He received 1 gram of calcium
gluconate, 1 amp of D5, and 10 units of regular insulin as well
for hyperkalemia. Renal and cardiology were consulted.
.
On the floor, he reports he has to move his bowels, but
otherwise denies any shortness of breath or other complaints. Of
note, has highly variable BP readings depending on position,
alternating in rapid sequence from 70-110's systolic.
.
Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology service
from [**2147-6-10**] until [**2147-6-16**] after being transferred from
[**Hospital6 27369**]. At that time, he had acute on chronic
renal insufficiency, as well as hypotension. He was diuresed
with a lasix drip, which was switched to torsemide. EP also
followed the patient, and his ICD was re-programmed to allow for
native conduction, with consideration of up-grade to
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacer in future, as this was deferred given
improvement in his symptoms with diuresis. His blood pressure
was noted to be 70-100 systolic during that admission with
normal mentation. Elevated creatinine was felt to be secondary
to poor forward flow, and LFT elevations secondary to
congestion.
.
He states that since his admission, he has been at
rehabilitation. He reports he gained about 10 pounds since
discharge, though he's not sure how. On [**2147-6-28**] he presented
to [**Hospital6 17032**] for hyperkalemia, worsening
renal function, and hypotension.
