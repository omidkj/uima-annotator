Pertinent Results:
TTE [**9-23**]//11:Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is top normal and free
wall motion is normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this
prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (similar to prior study). Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-9-20**],
trace paravalvular aortic regurgitation is now detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**9-15**] for completion of pre-op w/u and IV heparin
while off coumadin.  Underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**9-16**]
and was transferred to the CVICU in serious condition on
titrated vasopressin, epinephrine, levophed, milrinone, and
propofol drips. Her chest was left open due to difficulty with
oxygenation. She continued to require significant pressor
support over the next few days and ultimately had her chest
closed on POD #3. Continued on nitric oxide for additional
support and this was subsequently changed to sildenafil.
Cardioversion attempted several times for rapid A Fib.
Amiodarone started.

Renal was consulted for volume overload and CVVHD started to
manage acute kidney injury. Tube feeds also started. Hepatology
consulted on POD #8 for increasing jaundice and rising INR.
Evaluation which included RUQ ultrasound was unremarkable.
Enzymes trended down.  GI was consulted to help evaluate
elevated pancreatic enzymes.  These would trend down as well.
Bronchoscopy done [**9-24**] to assess airway given inability to
wean. She slowly began to respond after days of decreased mental
status. Multiple skin issues were addressed given her
brittleness and anasarca. She also developed diarrhea and flagyl
started empirically while awaiting C diff cultures.  These would
return negative and Flagyl was discontinued.  She developed a
leukocytosis and all lines were changed. Cipro was started for
Enterobacter UTI.  She was fed via DobHoff tube.  Coumadin was
resumed for atrial fibrillation.  Urine output picked up renal
function improved, and the patient did not have to transition to
Hemodialysis.

The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 5682**] Nursing and Rehab in
[**Hospital1 **] for further recovery and Physical Therapy.
