History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 yo F with HTN, HLD, and h/o TAA who presented
to the [**Hospital **] Hospital ED with back pain.  As per the pt, she
was up at 7 am and when she twisted to the right, she
experienced sudden onset severe back pain and severe abdominal
pain.  She describes it as [**8-31**] which lasted 15 minutes and
started improving and went away.  She felt associated shortness
of breath.  She started having N/V and came to the ED.  She had
never felt this pain before.
.
Her initial VS upon presentation to the OSH ED were: T97.4,
HR79, BP 175/98, RR22, and 98% on RA.  She received a CT scan of
the abdomen which showed no evidence of a ruptured AAA, and a
repeat CT chest showed a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm
dissection.  She was transferred directly to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for
further management of her descending aortic dissection.

Echo [**2127-5-23**] Dilated descending thoracic aorta without discrete
dissection flap (best assessed by TEE, MRI or CT). Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

CT CAP [**2127-5-23**] Type B aortic dissection originating just distal
to the left subclavian artery and extending into the proximal
abdominal aorta, terminating proximal to the renal artery
origins. Aneurysmal dilation of the descending thoracic aorta to
5.6 cm and suprarenal abdominal aorta to 5.0 cm. No mediastinal
hematoma, evidence of aortic leak or end organ injury.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 yo F with HTN, HLD, and h/o TAA diagnosed 1.5
years ago who presented to the [**Hospital **] Hospital ED with back
pain.  She was found to have a descending aortic dissection and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further management.
.
# Descending aortic dissection: Pt was hemodynamically stable on
arrival and BPs in the 130/80s. Given her stability, and the
location of the dissection (descending, type B), the plan was to
medically manage her by keeping the BP and HR low. She was on a
drip of esmolol and then diltiazem overnight. In the morning she
was switched to metoprolol IV since metoprolol could be
converted to po dosing and BBlockers are able to lower the HR,
BP, and dPdt. Per radiology no change in extension of dissection
btw [**5-21**] OSH scan and ED admit scan.  All vessels arise from the
true lumen. OSH [**2124**] scan showed no dissection. Pt had an
espisode of mild back/chest pain, which resolved after about 15
minutes when patient belched. Pulses were checked and were 2+ in
all 4 extremities. Pt's BP and HR goals had been met early in
the day. ACEi was consitered when in the evening pt's SBP was
130s for the first time that day. At approx 4:15am, pt went to
use commode and upon returning to her bed called for assistance
stating that she felt very unwell and short of breath.  Soon
after became unresponsive and pulseless. Monitor showing PEA.
CPR performed for 50 minutes. Initial rhythm slow PEA in the
50s-60s. Epi and atropine were given early. Glucagon and
dextrose given empirically for excess beta blockade although
this was felt to be unlikely and inconsistent with rapid
decompensation. Advanced airway obtained. Central venous access
obtained through R femoral artery. Rhythm transiently VF, but
then returned to PEA.  Ultimately 5 doses of epi were given, 2
doses of atropine, two doses of glucagon, dextrose, bicarb,
calcium gluconate, 2L NS. TPA considered but not pursued given
dissection and possibility that this decompensation could be
from hemorrhage [**12-24**] progression/rupture of dissection. Time of
death 5:10am.  Family declined autopsy.
.
# HTN: pt has h/o of HTN usually on ACEi at home. pressures were
well-contoled with IV Bblockade.
.
# Goiter: Pt has h/o hypothyroidism on levothyroxine. TSH and
free T4 were WNL, so levothyroxine was held.
.
# HLD: Home dose of simvastatin 20 mg PO QHS was continued.
.
# Leukocytosis: Pt had WBC of 11.8 on admission labs without
localizing signs of infection and was afebrile.  Likely [**12-24**]
stress reaction.
.
# DVT PROPHYLAXIS: Decision was made not to give heparin in the
setting of dissection. Patient was wearing pneumatic boots while
in bed to prevent DVT, and was frequently out of bed in a chair
and ambulated to comode with assistance.
#
Patient was full code.
