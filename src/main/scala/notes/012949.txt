Glucagon 1.4 mg

Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
conscious sedation. The patient was placed in the prone position
and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced
under direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum
was reached. Careful visualization was performed. The procedure

with an impacted stone at the ampulla.
Procedures: 1. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Bleeding was encountered during sphincterotomy.
2. CBD stones and sludge were extracted successfully using a 12
mm balloon.
4. A 5 cm by 10 Fr double pig tail biliary stent was placed
successfully to prevent occlusion due to clots.
5. An epinephrine injection was applied for hemostasis
successfully at the apex of the sphincterotomy.


Impression: 1. Normal major papilla
2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique
3. Cholangiogram showed dialated CBD to 1.5 cm.

successfully at the apex of the sphincterotomy.


Recommendations: 1. Return to medical service of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 73380**]
