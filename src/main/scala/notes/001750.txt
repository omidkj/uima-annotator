Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 49 yo man w/ history of left ankle injury 1 yr ago
transferred from an outside hospital for continued management of
bilateral pulmonary emboli with left deep venous thrombosis
without hemodynamic instability.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. Bilateral PE w/ left DVT - On admission, he was
hemodynamically stable w/o right heart strain by EKG or OSH
ECHO. He was monitored in the ICU on heparin gtt + coumadin. His
risk factors included obesity, tobacco use, and h/o trauma to
ankle. Would strongly recommend a hypercoagulable workup as an
outpatient, including colonoscopy, PSA, and hypercoagulable
labs. He was discharged when his INR was therapeutic on coumadin
(with goal [**2-10**]) for 2 days. His PCP's office was contact[**Name (NI) **] to
get in touch with him for follow-up.

2. Cough w/ sputum - He was admitted with a cough productive of
sputum and leukocytosis but no fevers. He had a CXR without
obvious infiltrate. His sputum culture grew moraxella, but he
was otherwise asymptomatic. As it was unclear whether this was
colonization vs infection, he was not treated. He did report
chest pain, which was thought to be secondary to his PEs. He was
treated with nebulizers, then inhalers, and acetaminophen with
codeine. He initially needed additional pain medications but had
not taken any for several days prior to discharge.

3. Nicotine dependence - The patient was strongly encouraged
throughout his hospital stay to stop smoking. He was educated on
smoking cessation and given a prescription for the nicotine
patch on discharge. He endorsed the concept of quitting at the
time of discharge.

4. GERD - He was treated with a PPI but discharged without
(return to aciphex).

5. Code status - full

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
1) Acute pulmonary emboli
2) Deep Venous Thrombosis

Secondary:
3) Anemia - unspecified, perhaps iron deficiency or anemia of
chronic disease
4) chronic low back pain with neuropathic pain extending into
left lower extremity, s/p surgery in past


Discharge Condition:
Good; no further chest pain, improved cough, good oxygen
saturation on room air, stable vital signs.


Discharge Instructions:
Take all medications as prescribed below.
Follow up with your primary care provider as scheduled, ask him
to schedule you for a colonoscopy.

Call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have any
shortness of breath, worsening cough, chest pain, new or
worsening leg pain, dizziness or lightheadedness, bright red
blood in your stool or black stools, nausea, vomiting, or any
other concerning symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
You need a colonoscopy and perhaps an EGD to look at your colon
and perhaps your stomach and small intestine to further evaluate
the cause of your anemia (low blood count). It is important to
ensure you have no evidence of colon cancer or other type of
malignancy (cancer).

You must have your blood checked to monitor your coumadin
dosing.  It is essential that you call your primary care
physician and get your 'INR' checked this week so that he can
adjust your coumadin as needed.
You should call the [**Hospital **] clinic after discharge to arrange
for a consultation with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9645**]) to discuss
any further evalution for a predisposition to forming blood
clots.

You have the following appointment scheduled:
