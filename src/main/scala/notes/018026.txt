Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 78-year-old concentration
camp survivor with a history of known arrhythmias, status
post cardioversion, presented with a one week history of
increasing dyspnea.  He had some left-sided chest pain and
some pain behind jaw and ear which went away.  He had some
coughing and production of yellow sputum which was treated
with a Z-Pak.  He was also febrile and had decreased
appetite.  He stated that he had increased DOE and occasional
PND, occasional orthopnea and sleeping on two pillows.  His
cough had resolved already by the time he was seen by the
medicine service and admitted on the 28.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) History of DVT, 2) Chronic renal
insufficiency, 3) Pronestyl-induced SLE, 4) Chronic leg
edema, 5) History of atrial fibrillation, status post
cardioversion, 6) Status post cholecystectomy, 7) Status post
nephrectomy secondary to renal cell cancer in [**2162**].

MEDS ON ADMISSION:  Quinidine 325 tid, Pepcid 20 mg qd,
Zestril 30 mg qd, lasix 20 mg qod as needed, Norvasc 5 mg qd,
coumadin 3 mg qd, and alprazolam 0.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].

ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.

He was seen by the medicine service.  EKG showed an old left
bundle branch block with first degree AV block and left axis
deviation.  His chest x-ray showed tiny calcified granulomas
at the left apices and new bilateral pleural effusions with a
question of early right upper lobe pneumonia.  Blood cultures
were pending.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 137, K 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 24,
BUN 35, creatinine 1.8, blood sugar 118.  White count 11.4,
hematocrit 35.4, platelet count 178,000.  PT, PTT and INR
were pending at that time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was referred in from [**Hospital3 2358**], and
the patient was referred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for his new congestive
heart failure with effusions.  This was most likely due to a
recent MI.  Lasix diuresis was begun.  His baseline
creatinine was approximately 1.6 which was monitored.  He was
seen by ID.  PPD was placed to evaluate for TB exposure, and
rule out any active infection.  He continued to have all
these systems worked on to improve his medical picture.

He was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of cardiology.  He did have
crackles halfway up bilaterally.  His enzymes showed non-ST
elevation myocardial infarction with some ischemia.  He
continued on aspirin.  Heparin was held, as his INR was
supertherapeutic.  At admission it was 5.2 which went down to
4.3.  His beta blocker was held while he was in failure, and
the plan was that he would have a cardiac cath as soon as his
INR dropped below 1.8.  His hematocrit was at 35.6, and he
received some gentle rehydration precath.  He received IV
lasix for diuresis and continued on his ACE inhibitor and
remained on telemetry.  His creatinine was at 1.7.

He was seen by the heart failure nurse practitioner to
discuss his congestive heart failure and some planning for
home diet.  He was seen by case management.  He was also seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of cardiology and EPS service for some
nonsustained VT in the setting of his MI, with
recommendations to try beta blocker, or decrease his Norvasc
if possible.  A discussion was had about mapping him, but it
was determined that he should have a cardiac catheterization
as soon as possible as first line evaluation, as his INR
continued to drop.

He was also seen by the GI service, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] who was
his former primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] continued with his
lasix diaphoresis, as he was prepared for cardiac
catheterization.  He had a hematology consult for his
longstanding, increased PTT.  He had no further NSVT.  On the
3, his INR dropped to 1.7.  Hematology recommended checking
additional factors including lupus anticoagulant, and noted
also that his quinidine could produce lupus-like symptoms.

He was seen by the EP service on the 4, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  They
studied him and saw dual AV node physiology with some
short-lived episodes of SVT that were slow.  Please refer to
their note, and they recommended getting his diagnostic
cardiac cath done, and then having his ICD after his cardiac
surgery and work-up.  They also recommended continuing him on
beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.

Hem/Onc saw him again now that he had been off his coumadin
for seven days, but his INR remained resistant and elevated
at 1.8.  They thought that this was possibly due to his
antibiotic which was causing a decreased Vitamin K producing
bacteria.  Antibiotic were already stopped, and they
determined there was no need for Vitamin K.  They were still
awaiting results of his factor panels and his lupus
anticoagulant.

He was seen by the nursing case manager.  He had a cardiac
cath done on the 5, and it was recommended intra-aortic
balloon pump be placed and the patient transferred to the CCU
prior to his operation.  He was seen by cardiac surgery
resident on the 5, who noted his history.  His cardiac cath
showed a left main stenosis and LAD irregularity, some trace
MR, global hypokinesis, a nondominant right.  Please refer to
the cardiac catheterization report.

His labs preoperatively were sodium 142, K 4.2, chloride 104,
CO2 26, BUN 37, creatinine 1.5, white count 7.0, hematocrit
34.2, blood sugar 108, platelet count 248,000, PT 16.3, PTT
56.9, INR 1.8 with positive lupus anticoagulant.  Blood gases
7.43/39/72/27/1.  His chest x-ray showed some mild pulmonary
edema from the 28.  The plan was CABG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had his balloon placed and was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.  The patient was seen
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**], with plans for more Vitamin K today
and FFP, if needed in the OR, for his INR, and plans to
operate on him on the following day after he got his balloon.

He was followed by hematology.  The patient was also seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21815**] from cardiothoracic surgery, the Chief
Resident, and on the 7 he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3 with a LIMA to the LAD, and a vein sequentially
from OM to his left PDA.  He was transferred to
Cardiothoracic ICU on a Nitroglycerin drip at 2.0 and an epi
drip at 0.025 in stable condition.

On postoperative day #1, he had a T-max of 100.2, blood
pressure 114/58, satting 97% at 3 liters nasal cannula, as he
had been extubated overnight.  His balloon pump remained at
1:1.  White count 11.9, hematocrit 32.6, platelet count
100,000.  Sodium 141, K 4.7, chloride 105, CO2 23, BUN 41,
creatinine 2.1, with a blood sugar of 125.  He was awake and
alert.  His heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  He had an
index of 2.5 with the balloon in and a mixed venous of 68.
His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His wounds were clean, dry
and intact.  He had no extremity edema.  He was on a dopamine
drip at 2.0 overnight, and this was weaned again in the
morning.  He remained with his Swan and his A-line.  He had
no bleeding complications postop, and hematology signed-off.

On postoperative day #2, his balloon came out.  He continued
on his perioperative vancomycin.  His creatinine dropped to
1.8 with a K of 4.6.  His hematocrit remained stable at 28.
He was on a Nitro drip at 0.75.  The lungs had decreased
breath sounds at the bases.  He continued on aspirin and the
Nitroglycerin weaned.  He was seen by physical therapy for
evaluation.

On postoperative day #3, he was started on the amiodarone
drip at 1.0 for new atrial fibrillation in the 70s, with a
blood pressure of 127/62.  His creatinine remained stable at
1.8 with a white count of 9.4.  His lungs were clear
bilaterally, but had decreased breath sounds at the bases.
He was switched to oral pain med.  He was restarted on his
coumadin.  He had a good urine output.

On postop day #4, he remained in atrial fibrillation.  He was
on a heparin drip at 600, coumadin dosing at 3, with a PT of
14.2, INR of 1.3, and a PTT of 52.4.  His creatinine rose
slightly to 1.9.  He had a norm
