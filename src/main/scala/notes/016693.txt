History of Present Illness:
84 year old gentleman with recent hx stroke in [**2162-10-21**], hx afib
now off coumadin who presents with melena and HCT drop. He has
been at [**Hospital3 **] since his stroke. Per their records he
has had guiac positive stools for the past week, with  HCT drop
on [**11-4**] from 26->21 that responded to 2 units pRBC with inc HCT
to 27. There was no overt bleeding at the time. At 2am on the
day off admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he had sudden onset dark tarry
diarrhea. He was hemodynamically stable with BP 120/56 and HR
75. He received one unit pRBC's at [**Hospital1 **] prior to transfer;
he received lasix 40mg after the unit.  The patient does not
know what his bowel movements have been like, but denies abd
pain, N/V, no hematemasis, no CP, no SOB, no confusion.

Review of systems is notable for slight residual weakness on the
right side, but improvement expressive aphasia. He does still
have dysarthria.  Review of systems is otherwise negative as
noted in HPI. Of note, he has failed speech and swallow in early
[**11-1**], has doboff from [**Hospital1 **].  He is also being treated for
aspiration PNA at [**Hospital1 **] with levofloxacin and flagyl to end
[**11-11**].

In the emergency department, he has had one episode of melena.
HCT 20. He received one unit pRBC's, on unit FFP, vit K 5mg IV
and protonix 40mg IV. He refused NG lavage. He was HD stable. He
was seen by GI who planned for EGD. 2 18 guage IV placed. EKG
with dig effect, trop neg x1.

Admission CXR:
SINGLE FRONTAL AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The mildly enlarged
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable in appearance. The pulmonary vasculature is
within
normal limits. There is persistent opacification of the left
retrocardiac
space. No new focal airspace consolidation is noted. There is
bilateral
apical pleural thickening, right worse than left. The right
costophrenic
angle is clear. There is an enteric tube traversing the expected
course of
the esophagus with the tip ending in the stomach.

IMPRESSION: Persistent opacity in the left retrocardiac space.
Cannot
exclude a superimposed pneumonia.

If clinical concern remains high, recommend repeating with PA
and lateral
chest radiograph for better assessment.
.
EGD:
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Other Blood clot noted in the stomach body, active bleeding
from pylorus, dobhoff tube pulled out.
Duodenum:
 Excavated Lesions A single spurting 5 mm visible vessel with
shallow ulcer was found in the apex of duodenal bulb. 5
cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] hemostasis with success. Four endoclips
were successfully applied for the purpose of hemostasis.
Impression: Ulcer in the apex of duodenal bulb (injection,
endoclip)
Blood clot noted in the stomach body, active bleeding from
pylorus, dobhoff tube pulled out.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Continue iv ppi
Follow Hct closely and tranfusion as needed
Please proceed with Angio if active bleeding
.
Echo [**10-18**]: The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is markedly dilated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
systolic prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biatrial elongation. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.
.
EKG: irreg in afib HR 80, downward sloping ST segent in V2-V5
wnd II, scopped ST segment in V6, no ST elevations, RRBB
patterin in V2
.
Renal Ultrasound:
CONCLUSION:
1. The kidneys are of good size, with no hydronephrosis, and
good
corticomedullary differentiation.
2. Incidental note is made of a non-obstructing 2-mm calculus in
the lower
pole of the left kidney.
.
Video Swallow:
IMPRESSION:
1. Aspiration with thin liquid consistency.
2. Penetration with nectar-thick consistency which resolve with
chin tuck
maneuver.
.
TEE [**2162-11-26**]:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrium is dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There are filamentous strands on the aortic
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate
([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetation identified. Mild-to-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Minimal aortic stenosis with trace aortic
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgi
