Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**]
Chief Complaint:
RUL and LLL masses, respiratory failure, VAP / post-obstructive
pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotrachial intubation, bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 69-yo woman smoker with hypertension,
hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and a recently diagnosed
RUL lung mass, who was admitted to OSH after PEA in Radiology.
The pt was undergoing an elective outpatient lung biopsy (TTNBx)
of her newly-diagnosed large RUL mass on [**2115-7-4**], and during the
procedure she became cyanotic, unresponsive, and pulseless. CPR
was initiated and the pt regained NSR, was intubated, and was
transiently on dopamine. Per the anesthesia report, there was
significant blood within the mouth prior to intubation and in
the airways thereafter. She underwent bronchoscopy and was then
found to have near-occlusion of the LLL bronchus with an
endobronchial tumor that extends into the left main stem
bronchus, with evidence of endobronchial bleeding from the right
side, and also evidence of an endobronchial lesion distant into
the RUL apical segments. The decision was made to transfer her
to [**Hospital1 18**] for IP evaluation for possible endobronchial stenting.
.
During the hospitalization, the pt spiked a fever to 101.4F
yesterday with leukocytosis to 28.7, and was started on
Vancomycin, Imipenem, and Ciprofloxacin to cover for possible
post-obstructive pneumonia and VAP. BAL culture returned with
Staph aureus sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, with other culture data
negative to date. She continues to have respiratory failure
requiring mechanical ventilation, on AC 500x12/40%/5. She also
underwent flexible bronchoscopy on Friday [**2115-7-5**] that showed
minimal residual bleeding, clots, and LLL obstruction.
Preliminary biopsy results from the RUL Bx are c/w small cell
carcinoma.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, the pt remains intubated and sedated.

With regards to her recent diagnosis, she reportedly had weight
loss of 25 pounds over the preceding 3-6 months, and SOB.

CXR [**7-8**]: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:
.
A relatively homogeneous 8-cm wide right upper lobe lung lesion
is most likely a mass. More heterogeneous opacification in the
right lung looks right middle and lower lobe pneumonia, but
would obscure other smaller lung nodules. Less distinct left
perihilar and infrahilar opacification could also be pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small. ET tube and nasogastric
tube are in standard placements. Heart size is normal. Poor
definition of the left bronchial tree suggests retained
secretions. The hila are not particularly enlarged. Right
internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC and a nasogastric tube
ends in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax.
.
Prior imaging should be obtained in order to assess the
chronicity and likely explanation for widespread pulmonary
abnormalities.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with
inferior hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is a possible vegetation on the aortic
valve. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke
volume due to aortic regurgitation. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Torn mitral chordae are
present. An eccentric, posterior directed jet of Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic regurgitation with possible aortic
valve endocarditis. Mildly to moderately reduced LVEF.
.
CTA chest/abd/pelvis:
1. Right upper lobe lung mass with bilateral hilar and
mediastinal adenopathy. Contralateral left hilar adeonpathy
causes
obliteration of the left lower lobe artery and moderate
narrowing of the left lower segment airways. This is concerning
for metastatic lung cancer. The mass is amenable to CT-guided
biopsy
.
2. Ill defined ground glass lung opacities likely represent
infection or
edema, although underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded. Followup
after
therapy can help exclude underlying tumor.
.
3. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Diffuse anasarca.
.
4. No evidence of aortic dissection.
.
TEE:
.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in
the right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile)
atheroma in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened with a focal 4mm nodule, but no vegetations or
abscess. Moderate to severe (3+) centrally directed aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse aortic leaflet thickening with focal nodule
atypical for a vegetation. No abscess seen. Moderate to severe
centrally directed aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation.. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Complex plaque
(>4 mm) in aortic arch.
.
CXR [**7-10**]:As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the
endotracheal tube still projects 5.2 cm above the carina. The
course and position ofthe right internal jugular vein catheter
is unchanged. Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube, the tip
of the tu
