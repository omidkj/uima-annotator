[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the operating room at the time of the
study.

POST BYPASS The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion and
is atrially paced. There is normal biventricular systolic
function. There is a bioprosthesis in the aortic position. It
appears well seated. The leaflets appear to be moving normally
in limited views. There is trace valvular aortic regurgitation.
At at cardiac output of 6 liters/minute, there is a maximum
gradient of 29 mmHg and a mean gradient of 14 mmHg across the
aortic valve. The effective orifice area is about 1.4 cm2. The
mitral regurgitation is much improved, now trace-mild. The
thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is 86yo man with known aortic stenosis and coronary
artery disease who was a direct admission to the operating room
aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting on
[**2193-8-6**], see Operative not for details. In summary he had:
Aortic valve replacement with # 23 StJude porcine vlave and
coronary bypass grafting x2 with left internal mamary to left
anterior descending artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to
posterior diagonal artery. His bypass time was 105 minutes with
a crossclamp time of 80 minutes. He tolerated the operation well
and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiac
surgery ICU in stable condition on Epinepherine and Propofol
infusions. In the immediate post-op period he was
hemodynamically stable, his anesthesia was reversed, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He was weaned from his
inotropes and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the
night of surgery. On POD1 he was started on diuretics and
Bblockers and transferred to the stepdown floor. All tubes lines
and drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocols.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  He did have an episode
of rapid atrial fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm
with titration of beta blocker.

By the time of discharge on POD #4 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged rehab EPOC of [**Location (un) 1887**] in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
