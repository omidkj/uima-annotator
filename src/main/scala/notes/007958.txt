Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
61yoM with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, known CAD
involving the LAD, CHF (EF 30-35%), afib on Coumadin presenting
for chest pain and dyspnea.  Of note, he was recently admitted
for Chest Pain and afib with RVR.

He reports that the chest pain has been chronic and persistent
since his recent discharge.  He has noted worsening shortness of
breath since discharge, particularily over the past 3 days.  He
endorses mild leg swelling, DOE, orthopnea and pnd. He denies
increased salt intake and notes that he has largely stayed in
bed since leaving the hospital.  no sick contacts, no recent uri
sx, no diarrhea/abd pain.

He presented to the ED where he was found to be in Afib with RVR
(HR 145).  He was treated with IV metoprolol 5 mg x 2, morphine,
aspirin, and nitroglycerin.  CXR was obtained and was negative.
WBC 11.0 and
Lactate 2.3.  CE's showed Trop 0.13, slightly up from last Trop
during prior recent hospital admission.  EKG was obtained.  He
was given nitropaste which decreased his blood pressure
preventing further rate control.  The patient was admitted to
cardiology for rate control.
.
Currently, he is in NAD but continues to have chest pain and
requests pain meds.  He would like a solution to prevent
repetitive admission.s
.
On review of systems, + as in HPI.  All of the other review of
systems were negative.

MICROBIOLOGY:
C. diff negative

IMAGING:
TEE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the right
atrium or the right atrial appendage. There is a patent foramen
ovale with respirophasic flow across the interatrial septum
visible at rest on color flow doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta down to 35cm from
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Tricuspid valve is normal with mild tricuspid
regurgitation. Pulmonic valve is normal. No pulmonic
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No LA/LAA/RA/RAA thrombus. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the LA. Stretched patent foramen ovale visible at
rest. Moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.

Compared with the prior transesophageal study (images reviewed)
of [**2182-3-29**], there is no LAA thrombus seen on the present study
and only mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LA.

Right heart catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate pulmonary
artery
hypertension with maximal PASP of 49mmHg when at baseline and
PVR of 4.4
[**Doctor Last Name **]. With the addition of 100% FiO2, there was a slight fall in
mean PA
pressure with a PASP of 51mmHg and PVR of 2.3 [**Doctor Last Name **]. With the
addition of
inhaled iNO, there was a slight further fall in both PA pressure
with a
mean PASP of 41mmHg and PVR of 2.1 [**Doctor Last Name **]. There was a modest
improvement in
CI with the addtion of 100% FiO2 and iNO from baseline; 2.32
L/min/m2 at
baseline, 3.03 L/min/m2 with 100% Fi02 and 3.09L/min/m2 with
iNO.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
2. No non-invasive oxymetric evidence of right-to-left shunting
under
the current loading conditions (arterial puncture not attempted
given
INR of 2.8).
3. Mildly elevated PCW consisted with mild LV diastolic heart
failure.
4. Slight improvement in PA pressures with 100% O2, with
reduction in
PVR driven in part by rise in PCW. With the addition of iNO,
slight
further improvement in PA pressures with slight further
reduction in PVR
(using assumed unchanged VO2 throughout).


Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old male with history of CAD, non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy, DM2, hypertension, and AF, presenting initially
with CP and SOB, then developed cardiogenic [**Doctor Last Name **], leading to
acute kidney injury and progressive volume overload, admitted to
the ICU for milrinone and Lasix gtt??????s with improvement. Hospital
course significant for failed electrical cardioversion for AF
and detection of shunt from PFO and pulmonary hypertension with
mild reversibility, started on sildenafil.
.
#. PUMP / cardiogenic [**Doctor Last Name **] with sCHF and RV dysfunction with
pulm HTN: Initial exam on transfer to CCU significant for
findings of volume overload (elevated JVD, lower extremity
edema) as well as cool extremities.  He was admitted to the CCU
in cardiogenic [**Doctor Last Name **] and a PA catheter was placed to tailor
therapy.  His cardiac index was quite low with elevated PA
pressures.  TEE and TTE showed RV dysfunction as well as severe
systolic failure and right-to-left shunting through a PFO.  With
concern for increased right-sided pressures with a normal PCWP,
it was thought that all of this preload was going into his
venous capacitance rathe
