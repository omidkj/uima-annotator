Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56M with congenital heart disease s/p complicated valve
repair/vsd/pfo repair [**12-10**] with recent trach/peg and very recent
admission to icu for GIB with negative EGD p/w dark stool and
baseline hct.
.
# Anemia/black stools: Patient recently had an upper EGD which
showed mild gastritis but was otherwise unremarkable. He
underwent colonoscopy and EGD with small bowel enteroscopy
without identification of a bleeding lesion to the level of his
J-tube. He subsequently underwent capsule endoscopy on [**2200-2-13**].
Results will be available in [**6-12**] days.  The report can be
obtained by calling Dr.[**Name (NI) 75011**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11048**] in 10
days.  His hematocrit at transfer was 27, higher than his
baseline at 24.  He subsequently drifted to 24 and was
transfused a total of 2 units, last on [**2200-2-11**]. His hematocrit
has subsequently stayed between 27-29.9 and was 28.5 at
discharge.  The patient's iron supplementation was held at
discharge.  For the procedures he was given ampicillin and
gentamicin for endocarditis prophylaxis. Last bowel movement was
immediately prior to transfer and was brown.
.
# Chronic Respiratory Failure:  The patient was stable on trach
collar during the day, each day, and the patient was oob in the
chair. At night the patient asked to be placed on the
ventilator.  The night prior to transfer he was on pressure
support ventilation overnight and tolerated well.  Per ABG, it
is likely the patient has a component of contraction alkalosis
which may be contributing to his need for ventilatory support at
night. He was restarted on his outpatient Lasix dose for his
primary providers to adjust as they deem necessary.
.
#  PAF: the patient is anticoagulated for the atrial
fibrillation, not the bioprosthetic valves. Therefore, the
coumadin had been held prior to admission and will continue to
be held until the results of the capsule endoscopy are
available.
.
# congenital heart disease: s/p recent surgery.  No CAD on cath
in [**12-10**].
Patient was restarted on aspirin, statin, and lower dose of beta
blocker as his
blood pressures ran lower during this hospitalization.  At
discharge his blood pressures running 90s/50s on metoprolol 12.5
mg [**Hospital1 **] with holding parameters, and he was tolerating this well.
.
# Anxiety/depression: continued home meds (fluoxetine, klonopin)

.
# DM/glucose control/hypoglycemia: initially hypoglycemic at
admission, then hyperglycemic on D5. The patient was restarted
on lower amount of TF than he had been receiving at his
facility, thus his long acting insulin was restarted at 1/2 dose
and SSI at discharge.
.
