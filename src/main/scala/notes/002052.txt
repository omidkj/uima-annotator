Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lipitor / Gemfibrozil / Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Line placement
Left Nephrostogram


History of Present Illness:
52M with h/o BPH, markedly elevated PSA (>200) and outlet
obstruction, presents with fever and hypotension. He presented
to the ED with confusion, fever and abdominal pain on [**4-11**]. In
the ED, he was found to have a positive UA with CT Abdomen
revealing bilateral hydronephrosis with pyeloneprhosis. He was
hypotensive requiring vaspressors 5L NS. Foley was placed and he
was initially treated with levofloxacin.
.
On admission to the MICU he was treated with vancomycin and
zosyn with vasopressors weaned off on day of admission. On [**4-12**]
urine culture grew enterococcus so Linezolid was started for
concern for VRE. Due to concern of ureteral obstruction as well
as bladder outlet obstruction, IR atempted placement left perc
nephrostomy tube, but ureterogram did not reveal obstruction or
hydroureter and therefore no tube placed. On [**4-13**] he developed
acute SOB and CT chest/abd showed small RP bleed at site of
prior procedure with no PE.  There was concern for anaphylaxis
to zosyn (as SOB was temporally related to infusion) so he was
given steroids, Epi, H1 and H2 blockers.
.
[**Hospital **] transferred to floor for further care.

Past Medical History:
1. S/P hemorrhagic CVA [**2127**] with residual partial right
hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopsia and partial aphasia.
Etiology of CVA thought to be thrombotic; MRA at that time
showed
no vascular abnormality. High homocysteine resolved with B
complex.
2. Reactive depression, never suicidal, improved.
3. GERD, nearly resolved after rx for H. pylori, now uses
ranitidine only prn.
4. Hypertension.
5. Chronic headaches, improved.
5. Hyperlipidemia / hyperuricemia. Triglycerides greatly
improved with strict diet but then patient regained weight.
6. Abnormal lfts - noted [**6-/2140**]; unclear if related to lipitor
or hyperlipidemia or other etiology, resolved. Hepatitis A Ab+,

Hepatitis B and C neg.
7. Sexual dysfunction. did not try cialis and is not currently
having sexual relations.
8. HTN
9. left hydronephrosis
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. S/P circumcision
2. S/P shrapnel wound upper back.
3. s/p ccy [**10/2142**]


Social History:
Cambodian immigrant (came to US at age 27).
Disabled. Lives with wife and 2 daughters. Resumed smoking up to
1 PPD, no alcohol, no history drug abuse.


Family History:

Physical Exam:
T 97.1 HR 70 RR 34 BP 118/70 99%% on RA  (on floor)
Gen: NAD
HEENT: PERRLA, OP clear
Neck: R IJ in place.
Lung: crackles at bases, no wheeze
Cor: RRR, nml S1S2 no MRG
Abd: NABS, soft NT, mod distended, no CVA tenderness
Ext: trace bilat LE edema, contracted on the R upper ext.
Back: mild Left CVA tenderness


Pertinent Results:
[**2143-4-11**] CT ABD: 1. Perinephric stranding with thickening of
Gerota's fascia on the left not identified on previous study
dated [**2143-2-18**]. The differential includes an
inflammatory process versus a slow forniceal leak. The renal
parenchyma cannot be well evaluated given lack of IV contrast
administration. No stones are identified within the
genitourinary system. There is mild increase in left hydroureter
since previous study.
2. There is a suggestion of a small bladder diverticulum at the
insertion of the left ureter. No definite bladder mass
identified to explain hematuria, although full evaluation is
limited secondary to lack of IV contrast administration.
3. Bibasilar airspace opacity representing either atelectasis or
pneumonia.
4. Trace bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left.
5. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
.
[**2143-4-12**] NEPHROSTOGRAM: Uncomplicated ultrasound and
fluoroscopically-guided left nephrostogram. No evidence of left
hydronephrosis or hydroureter or urinary obstruction.
.
[**2143-4-13**] CT PELVIS/ABD/CHEST: 1. New high-density material
surrounding the left ureter and tracking within the
retroperitoneum consistent with hemorrhage.
2. Abnormal perfusion of the left kidney, most severe at the
upper pole. Findings are consistent with pyelonephritis. Edema
and abnormal perfusion at the upper pole and interpolar region
medially with multiple peripheral hypoenhancing wedge- shaped
regions likely represent ischemia and a component of infarction.
3. Limited examination for pulmonary embolism due to suboptimal
contrast bolus with no large central embolus seen. Evaluation of
distal segmental and subsegmental branches is limited.
4. Small bilateral layering pleural effusions with associated
compressive atelectasis. Patchy predominantly ground-glass
opacities in both lower lobes, left worse than right could
represent pneumonia or pneumonitis.
5. 5mm cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas. Recommend 1
year follow up.
.
[**2143-4-13**] CXR: Questionable small right pleural effusion, vague
indistinct linear opacity in the right infrahilar region, likely
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Enterococcus Pyelonephritis/Urosepsis:  initially treated with
Vanco/Zosyn---> Linezolid.  Enterococcus isolate pan-S; pt
switched to Doxycycline on discharge given concern for ?Zosyn
allergy.  Will complete a total of 14 days of abx.  Lopressor
and Flomax held on d/c until pt follows up with PCP.
.
#?Anaphylaxis to Zosyn:  episode of acute SOB in ICU that was
thought to be temporally related to Zosyn.  Resolved with
treatment for anaphylaxis. CTA negative for large PE, CXR
without overt volume overload.  Will complete a total of 4 days
of steroids to prevent possible late anaphylaxis.  02 sats/Lung
exam normal on floor.
.
#Enlarged Prostate, ?Prostate Cancer: to f/u with urology as an
outpatient for bx.
.
#Urinary Retention:  No Hydronephrosis noted on Nephrostogram
(after Foley placed).  Per Urology, pt to leave Foley catheter
in place until f/u as outpatient.
.
#Acute Renal Failure: resolved after IVF.  Likely secondary to
prerenal causes/sepsis.
.
#Retroperitoneal Bleed: likely secondary to Nephrostogram (IR
procedure). Serial HCTs stable.
.
#5mm cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas: Noted on
imaging.  Per radiology, needs 1 year follow up.
