Imaging:
CXR [**2159-11-5**]:
IMPRESSION: Left hemidiaphragmatic elevation with large left
pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis; an additional
component of pneumonia cannot be excluded. Scoliosis may
contribute to underestimation of the effusion, so CT may be
considered.

Sputum Culture/ Blood Culture Pending
Bronchoalveolar lavage pending

Brief Hospital Course:
59 male with history of COPD, chronic tracheotomy/PEG, initially
presenting to OSH with increasing secretions, shortness of
breath, and cough x2 days, with OSH chest xray showing
retrocardiac opacity.

# Repiratory distress/Shortness of breath: Patient presented
with acute onset of cough, increased secretions, initially
thought to be from a pneumonia.  He was initially placed on
empiric antibiotics consisting of vancomycin and ceftazadime,
transitionined to vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin at [**Hospital1 18**].
Throughout stay, patient was clinically stable, was never
febrile, and was without leukocytosis.  Considered pulmonary
embolism (PE), however supratherepeutic INR>2 on admission made
embolism less likely.  He had a chest xray that was initially
concerning for a left pleural effusion, but ultrasound showed
minimal thoracic fluid.  Bronchoscopy was performed and was
unremarkable except for crusted mucus removed from trach edge.
His transfer note was initially concerning for a "pulsatile
mass" in the neck which was not appreciated at the time of [**Hospital1 18**]
evaluation.  Neck pain resolved with dislodging adherent tach
collar from underlying skin.  Sputum gram stain showed 25
neutrophils with 4+ gram positive rods, 2+ gram positive cocci,
1+ gram negative rods.  His outside hospital chest xray was
reviewed which again was less concerning for a pneumonia.  He
had his vancomycin and cefepime stopped on day 2 of admission,
and was continued on levofloxacin for an anticipated 7-day
course for tracheobronchitis.  Throughout his course he was
continued on his home dose albuterol, ipratropium and combivent,
as well as his pressure support ventilation at night with home
settings of 28/5, FiO2 40%.
*At time of discharge, bronch sputum culture and blood cultures
pending
*Continue levofloxacin for 7 day course (day 1 [**2159-11-6**])

# History of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)- Bilateral DVT in
[**7-/2159**] without PE.  INR 2.5 on admission.  Held coumadin for
one day and restarted 3mg daily (home dose) on discharge.
*As patient is on [**Last Name (LF) 92206**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have interaction with
warfarin.  Monitor INR.

# History of frequent PVCs- History of PVCs, and was previously
started on metoprolol.  Patient with multiple PVCs on telemetry
of unknown significance, with no symptoms.  Continued home dose
metoprolol.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Make sure to follow up sputum, BAL and blood cultures which are
pending, and monitor INR while on antibiotics.


Medications on Admission:
