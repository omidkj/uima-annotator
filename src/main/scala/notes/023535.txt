AP and lateral standing views of the LS spine shows posterior
osseous fusion extending from T12 through S1 and anterior
metallic disc spacer at L4-5. Several millimeters of posterior
listhesis of L2 on L3 and extensive bone graft in the posterior
soft tissues. Appearances are little changed from intraoperative
radiographs [**2158-6-20**]. Prominent aortic and vascular
calcifications. Incidental partially visualized apparent chronic
lung disease in the lung bases.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2158-6-24**] 7:27
PM
The patient was extubated with removal of the NG tube. The left
subclavian
line tip is at the level of low SVC/cavoatrial junction. The
hardware appears to be unchanged. There is slight interval
improvement in the left upper lobe consolidation, although it
may be related to differences in the study technique. On the
other hand, there is worsening of the left basal opacity that
might be consistent with atelectasis/aspiration with similar but
less extensive process at the right base. The lung volumes are
lower which might be due to termination of mechanical
ventilation.
Overall, the appearance of the lung is better than on [**2158-6-22**] radiograph.

(Complete) Done [**2158-6-23**] at 3:34:07 PM      FINAL
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2158-6-24**]  3:46:06 PM
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse ST-T wave changes suggestive of myocardial
ischemia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted electively and brought to the OR where under
general anesthesia she underwent T12 - L3 posterior fusion. She
tolerated this well, was extubated, transferred to PACU and then
floor when stable. Post op she had full motors but complained of
pain.  medications were adjusted.She was fitted for TLSO brace.
Abdomen was distended and NGT was placed. On POD#2 she had
episode of desaturation and required transfer to ICU for close
monitoring. She was found to have LLL pneumonia and started on
levoflox.  She had elevated troponin and was seen by cardiology
who recommended beta blocker and aspirin which was started.  She
remained stable and was transferred to stepdown unit [**6-26**].  She
was transfused with 2u PRBC for hematocrit of 23. On [**6-27**], the
patients repeat hematocrit was 30.  On [**6-28**], the patient was
seen by physical therapy who recommended dispo to rehab for
daily occupational and physical therapy to maximize safety in
adls and independence.AP and lateral standing views of the LS
spine shows posterior osseous fusion extending from T12 through
S1 and anterior metallic disc spacer at L4-5. Several
millimeters of posterior listhesis of L2 on L3 and extensive
bone graft in the posterior soft tissues. Appearances are little
changed from intraoperative radiographs [**2158-6-20**]. Prominent
aortic and vascular calcifications. Incidental partially
visualized apparent chronic lung disease in the lung bases.
Patient has been working with physical and occupational therapy
and will be discharged to a rehab facility.
