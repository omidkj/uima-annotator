Intubation
Central venous line insertion


History of Present Illness:
54 yo M without any known PMH was brought in by EMS for
respiratory distress after being notified by neighbor. History
was consistent with having been down for a considerable time
before being seen by EMS. He was brought in on BiPAP
ventilation, sats in low 90s and unresponsive.  He had a narrow
complex tachycardia in the 140s.  He had a difficult intubation
with 3 attempts complicated by vomiting and witnessed
aspiration.  After intubation, O2 sat noted to be 90%, pt
developed PEA arrest.  He had several rounds of epi/atropine,
CPR with subsequent wide complex tachycardia treated with DCCV
and amiodarone bolus.  He was started on amiodarone drip,
levophed drip, received 3L NS for hypotension.  He had a R
femoral TLC placed.
He was started on cooling protocol.  Head CT unremarkable, CXR

CT Head:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Mild sinomucosal disease in the ethmoid sinus.
3. Opacification of some of the left mastoid air cells;
correlate clinically.

CXR:
Heart size is mildly enlarged given technique and mediastinal
and hilar contours are normal. There is diffuse airspace
opacification. An ET tube is in place with its tip located 4 cm
from the carina. An NG tube is seen with its tip projecting over
the gastric bubble; the side-hole port is not clearly
identified. There is no significant pleural effusion,
pneumothorax, or obvious osseous abnormality.

IMPRESSION:
1. Standard position of ET tube and likely of the NG tube,
although side-hole port is not clearly demonstrated below the
diaphragm.
2. Diffuse airspace opacification likely represents pulmonary
edema, in this clinical context.

EEG:
This telemetry showed a continued burst suppression record.
There were frequent truncal myoclonic jerks evident on video.
These
correlated with movement artifact on EEG. Although there were
sharp
waves as part of the bursts during the burst suppression record,
sharp
activity was not particularly rhythmic nor suggestive of ongoing

electrographic seizures or status epilepticus. Overall, the
recording
is most suggestive of anoxic myoclonus and an extremely severe
encephalopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
# s/p PEA arrest:  The patient was successfully revived after
his PEA arrest.  The causative [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for his arrest was thought
to be hypoxia in the setting of fluid overload.  His
hemodynamics improved with diuresis and positive pressure
ventilation.
.
# Post anoxic myoclonus/ Status epilepticus: The patient
underwent arctic sun cooling protocol. EEG consistent with
seizure activity. Patient was loaded with valproate and
phenytoin which were adjusted based on level.  Repeat EEG showed
disorganized function.  Given his anoxic brain injury and
non-convulsive status, his prognosis for meaningful recovery was
very poor.  He was appointed a guardian by the court. Prior to
this the team was prepared to place PEG and trach, but delayed
this given that the team was recommending to the guardian, once
she could be appointed, that the patient should be made CMO.
Ultimately, a PEG was not placed. He did not show any signs of
responsiveness or meaningful indepedent motor or verbal activity
during any part of the admission.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: The patient was maintained on a
regimen of aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75, lisinopril 10,
atorvastatin 80, and metoprolol throughout his stay until he was
CMO.
.
# Fevers:  The patient had an observed aspiration in the context
of his emergent intubation.  He was initially treated with ten
days of azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin.  He
continued to have fevers.  BCx showed GPC and he was started on
vancomycin, which was discontinued when cultures failed to grow
organisms.  Sputum culture grew pseudomonas and enterococcus.
He was given zosyn and cipro for VAP per with defervescence
lasting > 10 days.  However, he became febrile again.  Repeat
culture showed GNR by gram stain, thought likely to be a
colonizer.  CT of his sinuses showed miltifocal opacities
possibly demonstrating acute sinusitis. Antibiotics were
continued. He had significant eosinophilia later in the
admission suggesting the possibility of a drug reaction but
ultimately as this was not clearly creating clinical
consequences antibiotics and other medications were continued
until he was made CMO.
.
# Red eye: developed red eye on [**3-15**], began having serosanguinous
drainage on [**3-16**]. optho saw patient and believe is chemosis.
Recommended non-antibiotic ointment. This improved with
diuresis.
.
# Pump: Earlier in the admission he became total body fluid
overloaded and was diuresed with improvement.  He was kept
euvolemic for the remainder of his stay.
.
# DM: During much of his stay he was strikingly insulin
resistant.  He was managed with ISS and glargine.
.
# Proph: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots. dc'd sc heparin for
elevated PTT and oozing from injection sites.
.
# Goals of care and code status: Patient was initially full
code. After guardian was appointed, it was ultimately made
comfort measures only after a court order to appoint a guardian
and allow DNR/CMO late in the day on the [**10-14**]. On the 6th
of [**Month (
