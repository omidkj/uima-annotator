HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:

Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with history of ?bradycardia, LE swelling,
CKD, HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, RA who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for pacemaker placement s/p symptomatic bradycardia.  Per OSH
(Good Sumaritan) records, she was in usual state of health until
this evenning when she developed acute onset dizziness while
washing her dishes when she fell and EMS was caled.  No LOS or
headache.  On route developed chest pain radiating to her back
and got aaspirin 325 and nitro once.  In the ambulance she was
noted to be diaphoretic, pale, nausea with vomiting and
dizzzines.  The initial EKG showed junctional bradycardia in
40s.  A subsequent 12 lead EKG demonstrated aflutter with 5:1
conduction with rates between 49 and 52.  In the ED Code STEMI
was activated given STE in I and aVL and patient determined to
be medically managed and NOT taken to cath lab.  She was sent
for CT chest to r/o aortic dissection and after put on heparin
drip, asa, nitro drip, morphine, and continued on her home dose
of lasix, hydrochlorothiazide, and home benazepril was changed
to lisinopril (unknown dose).

Her exam at OSH was notable for BP systolic 160s both upper
extremities, bradycardia, crackles in left base, 2+ pitting
edema in LE bilaterally, and skin tear on left elbow with
brusing and echhymoses.  Labs WBC 11.3, hct 38.5, plt 225,000,
INR 0.9 PTT 30.  Na 137 K3.7, Cl94, bicarb 29, AG 14.  BUN/Cr
71/2.2.  glu 250 and Ca 9.6.  Cl 73, peak MB 14, peak TropI
1.55.

EKG with Aflutter 5:1 conduction block.  1mm STE in I, 2mmSTE in
aVL with reciprocal ST depressions in II, II, avF, V5 and V6.
Also "new LBBB".  CXR with enlarged cardiac silhouette.  CT
Chest showed cardiac enlargement with small pericardial
effusion, large hiatal hernia, small right pleural effusion.
ECHO showed EF 60-65%, normal systolic function, right atrium
mildly dilated, trace AR, no AS, Pulmonary HTN present with RVSP
67

On arrival to CCU the patient appeared well and was conversant,
alert and oriented x3.  She did describe some chest pain on her
lower right sternum which only was present during moving.  The
pain was felt to be internal and non-radiating.  She denied
nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath, but did endorse a cough
which is new.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with PMHx of HTN, HL, questionable
history of bradycardia and CHF, also with CKD who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] hospital with near syncope found to be in 3rd degree
heart block/Aflutter with evidence of lateral STEMI .
She was transferred here for consideration of pacemaker
placement.

ACUTE ISSUES
# Afib with Junctional escape/complete heart block: Per son and
attending, this had happened in the past and pt had not been
symptomatic. ECG changes indicated likely completed STEMI that
could be contributing to bradycardia vs acute on chronic
process. Patient felt dizzy when walking with physical therapy.
At this point in time it was decided to not place a pacemaker.

# Completed STEMI: Trop peak was 1.5 at the outside hospital.
She was treated with heparin for 2 days as ACS treatment. She
was also given aspirin and plavix. Her beta blocker wa held
because of slow heart rate. She was not brought to cath lab
because it was believed this was a completed MI. On [**8-18**] her
CKMB was down to 4  and trop down to .32.

# Right arm hematoma: Patientn came home with a right arm
hematoma. She did not recall how she got this though it is
possible it was related to when she fell before coming in.
