History of Present Illness:
PER STROKE FELLOW:
This is a 57 yo RH woman with history of HTN and
hyperlipidemia per her sister not on any medications who
presents
after complaining of right arm "pain" according to her sister
starting at 8pm tonight and then became very sleepy.  She then
fell asleep on the couch.  Her family was leaving at 830pm and
attempted to wake her up and noted that she was mute and not
responding. Per her sister she was "focusing to the left" by
this
she means looking towards the left.  The family also noted that
she was not moving her right side. She was brought to ER for
further eval.
ROS: Per her family she has not seemed herself for the last
couple of weeks.  She has complained of weakness of the right
upper extremity it has been difficult for her to put on her bra
and hold her granddaughter.  She had not reported any loss of
vision or other symptoms per the family.

Modifiable Risk Factors for Stroke

.
IMAGING:
.
CTA/P Head, Neck ([**2109-10-25**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings suggestive of an acute left ACA infarct with no
hemorrhage.
2. High-grade, greater than 80%, stenosis of the left internal
carotid
artery.
3. CT perfusion demonstrating decreased blood volume and
increased transit
time indicative of infarct in the left anterior cerebral artery
distribution.
4. Occlusion of the left anterior cerebral artery in its A2
segment at the
level of the genu of corpus callosum.
.
CT Head ([**2109-10-26**]):
IMPRESSION:
Foci of increased density along the left frontal cortex could be

secondary to contrast within the ischemic cerebral cortex or due
to petechial hemorrhages. No other abnormalities are seen.
.
CT Head ([**2109-10-26**]):
IMPRESSION:
Hypodensity involving the left frontal lobe in a distribution
compatible with further evolution of known left ACA territorial
infarction. No evidence of associated superimposed hemorrhage,
shift, or herniation.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW:
The hyperattenuating foci at the periphery of this process,
demonstrated on the study of some 14 hours earlier are no longer
evident; this likely represented "pooling" of residual contrast
material (from interval catheter angiogram) at the margin of the
ischemic/infarcted zone of
cortex. There is no evidence of hemorrhagic conversion at this
time.
.
MRI/A Brain ([**2109-10-27**]): PRELIM READ:
Evolving left anterior cerebral artery infarct with multifocal
left middle
cerebral artery infarcts involving both the cortex and deep
brain nuclei as well as several punctate embolic infarcts within
the left posterior cerebral artery distribution.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram: [**10-29**]

The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). A
patent foramen ovale or small secundum-type atrial septal defect
is present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF 70%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Positive bubble study
indicating presence of patent foramen ovale or small secundum
atrial septal defect.

CTA head [**10-31**]

IMPRESSION:

1. Visualized stent in the left internal carotid artery appears
to be patent, with normal blood flow in the carotid artery . The
reminder of the
intracranial circulation is unremarkable.

2. Sequelae for prior left anterior and middle cerebral artery
distribution infarct, overall unchanged. Asymmetry of pattern of
vascular enhancement in cerebral convexities, possibly related
to increased collateral flow to the left cerebral hemisphere.

CXR [**11-1**]:
FINDINGS: The new Dobbhoff catheter is satisfactory with its tip
in the distal stomach. Lungs are fully expanded and clear with
no mass, consolidation, or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is normal. A gastric band is noted.

IMPRESSION:

Satisfactory placement of new Dobbhoff catheter.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 57 year-old right-handed smoker with a past
medical history including hypertesnsion and hyperlipidemia who
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with a global aphasia and right
hemiparesis.  She was admitted to the stroke service from
[**2109-10-25**] to [**2109-11-5**].
.
NEURO
.
The patient's symptoms were quite concerning for stroke.
Accordingly, CT of the head with angiography and perfusion
components was performed.  The study demonstrated an acute left
ACA infarct with decreased blood volume and increased transit
time in the left anterior cerebral artery distribution in the
setting of a high grade (>80%) stenosis of the left internal
carotid artery.  As clnical evaluation revealed a NIHSS of 18,
and there were no contraindications, IV tPa was administered.
The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for
emergent stenting of the left internal carotid artery.
Follow-up CT scans demonstrated stability of the left ACA
infarction without superimposed hemorrhage, shift, and
herniation.  In addition to the evolving left anterior cerebral
artery infarct, an MRI/A demonstrated multifocal left middle
cerebral artery infarcts involving both the cortex and deep
brain nuclei as well as several punctate embolic infarcts within
the left posterior cerebral artery distribution.  To evaluate
for a cardioembolic source, a transthoracic echocardiogram was
done.  The study showed no source of an embolism but a patent
foramen ovale (see Pertinent Results).  Although it was felt
that her embolic event was most likely the result of
embolization from carotid stenosis, give PFO, she underwent a
hypercoagulable evaluation that was negative (see pertinent
results).  She was treated with ASA 81 mg, and Plavix 75 mg. She
should remain on these medications until follow up with
neurology or at least six months. She was started on
atorvastatin 40mg, her LDL was 101, her goal is deemed to be <
70
