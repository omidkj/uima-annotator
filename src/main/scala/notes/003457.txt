History of Present Illness:
78 yo male on ASA reportedly found unconscious at the bottom of
10 stairs of his home by his daughter. [**Name (NI) **] was taken to an area
hopsital where he underwent CT imaging;  head CT showing IPH and
SDH without shift. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

[**4-15**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:
1. No change in left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, small
focus of hemorrhage within the septum pellucidum and small acute
subdural hematoma along the left temporal lobe.
2. Chronic bifrontal subdural collections with interval slight
increase in density compared to the study today at 9:17 a.m.
consistent with rebleed or possible communication with the left
temporal subdural .
3. Mildly displaced fractures of the right medial and lateral
pterygoid plates, not completely included in the field of view.
Fractures are better evaluated on today's companion CT of the
facial bones.

[**2143-4-16**] MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:
1. 9-mm focus of hemorrhage within the septum pellucidum is
unchanged. Susceptibility artifact and blooming on the gradient
echo images is evidence that this does not represent a colloid
cyst as on the non-contrast CT done earlier, there is no
evidence of calcification in this to explain the susceptibility
effect.
Follow-up CT can be helpful to assess resolution.

2. No short interval change in the left temporal parenchymal
contusion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-15**], there are again
multiple rib fractures on the right. However, no evidence of
pneumothorax or definite opacification consistent with hematoma.

IMPRESSION: Little overall change.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery and Plastic
Surgery were consulted given his injuries; both of which were
nonoperative. He was loaded with Dilantin and will continue with
this for a total of 1 month; follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an
MRI of the brain at that time. Serial head CT scans have been
stable. His mental status is alert and oriented x2-3; very
cooperative with his care and he is very hard of hearing.

Plastic Surgery was consulted for his multiple facial fractures
and these were managed conservatively. It was recommended that
he be on a soft diet and he can follow up if needed in Plastic
Surgery clinic for any issues that may arise.

His foley catheter was removed and his Flomax was restarted.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended rehab after acute hospital stay.
