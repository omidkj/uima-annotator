increased in density compared to prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Health Care Associated Pneumonia: On arrival, patient had
normal oxygen saturation on non rebreather.  He was treated with
vancomycin and zosyn and prn albuterol and ipratropium.  CXR on
[**4-16**] demonstrated multifocal PNA. Oxygen support was rapidly
weaned and his oxygen saturation was 99% of 4L NC on discharge.
PICC placed [**2200-4-17**]. Planned total 8 day course of vanc/zosyn,
to finish on [**2200-4-23**].

# Urinary Tract Infection: U/A on admission was suggestive of
UTI, and he was treated empricially with antibiotics as above.
Urine cultures pending on discharge.

# Toxic Metabolic encephalopathy: Likely secondary to infection.
 On admission, patient unresponsive to verbal stimuli,a nd only
responded to sternal rub.  By discharge, he was awake and alert,
but oriented to self only.

# CHF: Appears hypovolemic on admission.  Metoprolol and
nitroglycerin held throughout hospital stay out of concern for
sepsis.  He was restarted on his metoprolol on discharge.  His
nitro patch & lasix should be held until he can be evaluated by
a physician at his rehab facility.
