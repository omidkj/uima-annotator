Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with PMH of atrial fibrillation
(not on coumadin), CHF, HTN, and rheumatoid arthritis (on
prednisone) who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] on the morning
of the day of transfer with nausea and vomiting. Patient was
last in her usual state of health two days prior to presentation
when she began to feel mild malaise with loss of appetite. On
the day early morning hours of the day of admission, the
sensation progressed to frank nausea with vomiting. The vomit
did not have blood or dark material but patient admits that she
would not be able to see this well, owing to her macular
degeneration. Leading up to this she did not notice a change in
her bowel habits. She denies fevers but reports feeling very
cold in the two days preceding admission. Initial laboratory
investigation revealed elevated ALT/AST 418/315, TBili 4.0,
lactate 1.6.  CT abdomen revealed choledocholithiasis.  She
received 2L of NS, with subsequent hypotension (BP 80/50).
Another 1L NS was given with improvement of blood pressures BP
130/90s.  Vancomycin, metronidazole and levofloxacin were given
for suspected ascending cholangitis. Zofran was given for
nausea. She was transferred for further management and likely
ERCP. Vitals prior to transfer: BP 133/92, 96% RA.
.
On arrival to the ICU, Vital signs T: BP:136/97 P:107 R:22
O2:92%. She has no pain, no shortness of breath, no nausea, but
endorses a feeling of "sour stomach". She feels no fever and has
been having diarrhea for the day which she attributes to the
antibiotics she is receiving.

MICROBIOLOGY:
BCx pending
UCx pending

From OSH:
[**4-13**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast: stones in the distal
common bile duct and gallbladder with dilatation of the common
bile duct and central intahepatic bile ducts

EKG:  afib with rate to 126, LAD, diffuse ST-depressions in
inferior, lateral, and anterior leads

ERCP:
Impression: Two large periampullary diverticula were found at
the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in opacification - A full
cholangiogram was not done given cholangitis.
The bile duct was severely dilated to 18 mm with multiple large
filling defects consistent with CBD stones noted.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Pus was noted to drain from the biliary orifice.
Given cholangitis, decision was made to place a stent rather
than attempt lithotripsy and stone extraction in the current
setting.
A 5cm by 10FR double pigtail biliary stent was placed
successfully.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH of afib with RVR, CHF, and RA
on prednisone who is transferred here from OSH for
choledocholithiasis with concerns for ascending cholangitis. She
is hemodynamically stable, afebrile on abx, and awaiting ERCP
for stone removal.

# Choledochilithiasis/Ascending cholangitis: Patient presented
to OSH with two days of malaise culminating in nausea and
vomiting of unrelenting nature. Concerned for dehydration, her
family brought her to the hospital where she was found to have
elevated LFT's of a cholestatic picture, and hypotension
initially not responsive to fluids. CT showed
choledocholithiasis with CBD dilation. Patient was started on
abx (vanc, levofloxacin, flagyl) and was given IVF with
stabilization of BP. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP and
stone removal. Currently, BP stable at 130's systolic with HR
120-130 and without fever, pain, and with mild jaundice. Her
antibiotics was changed to ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for
abdominal flora. She was given 500 cc NS bolus for her BP. She
was kept NPO for ERCP. Following ERCP, she tolerated clear
liquids without issue.  Her diet was tolerated and she had no
further abd pain and her lft/bili continued to improve.  She was
discharge on cipro/flagyl to complete a 7 day course(end [**4-22**])
and had a follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**6-12**] at 245 pm to
discuss further intervention.

# Afib with RVR: Patient has a history of afib with RVR for
which she is on rate control with metoprolol and diltiazem at
home. Holding home dose for now in the setting of hypotension
related to N/V and infection. She received a dose of digoxin at
OSH but will hold here. ECG reveals afib with RVR. She is not on
anticoagulation at home because of significant vaginal bleeding
that she experienced on coumadin. She was given metoprolol 12.5
mg PO as one time doses to control her HR and her diltiazem was
held. Following her ERCP, her Metoprolol and Diltiazem were
restarted with improvement in her heart rate. Anticoagulation
was deferred given expected procedures during the hospital stay.
 Her metoprolol and dilt were continued.  She would have
episodes of asymptommatic hypotension at night for which her
meds were held, but then her hr would increase.  She was
discharged on metoprolol 50 tid and dilt 30 [**Hospital1 **] with good hr
control.  BP will have to be monitored at rehab.  She was
restarted on aspirin on discharge(she previously had not been on
coumadin)

# CHF: Patient has a known history of chronic CHF of unknown
type. She is on home Lasix and beta blocker. Currently she is
not showing signs of heart failure, but did receive large
amounts of fluids for volume depletion/hypotension at OSH.
Cardiology consultation note obtained from [**Hospital6 **]
noted that she had "normal ejection fraction," b
