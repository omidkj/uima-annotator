Allergies:
Pneumovax 23

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement

History of Present Illness:
88yo F Russian speaking woman with dCHF, s/p AVR 3 years ago,
SSS with baseline HR in the 40s, feeling week and tired today
with heart rates in the 30s. Patient has had "good days" and
"bad days" with some days feeling very tired and fatigued and
other days feeling more energetic. Today, patient felt
especially tired. Noted dyspnea on exertion and some accompanied
chest pressure with exertion and nausea. No dizziness,
diaphoresis, syncope, blurred vision. Patient called Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 171**]
and he requested direct admission from home. Denies any fevers
or chills but does endorse ~5lbs weight loss over the past
several months and decreased appetite.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient felt tired. Denied any current
nausea, SOB, or CP. However systolic BP was 90-100.  Her HR was
20-30 bpm. On going to the bathroom she described chest pain,
[**5-26**], mild substernal with no radiation, that is not positonal
and is new for her. She complained of some mild headache and
continued to have some baseline orthopnea. Labs were drawn and
she was admitted to the CCU to be started on a low dose dopamine
infusion and is due for PPM implantation in the AM.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
As above, also denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary
frequency, dysuria, lower extremity edema, cough.

ECG
On admission the ECG showed extreme sinus bradycardia, with a
junctional or fascicular escape rhythm (rate 30-40 bpm)having a
RBBB, left axis deviation.  This represented a marked change
from previous ECGs that showed NSR or sinus bradycardia with
short-normal PR interval, and minor, nonspecific
intraventricular conduction delay, with QRS duration 110-120
msec.

TTE [**2163-3-24**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15
mmHg. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction. A mid-cavitary gradient is
identified. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve is not well
seen. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate
([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-12-8**],
the aortic valve gradient and max TR gradeint are higher however
they were probably underestimated on the prior study.

CXR [**2163-3-26**]:
There has been placement of new left-sided pacemaker with the
distal lead tips in the right atrium, right ventricle and
appropriately sited. Median
sternotomy wires are again seen. There are low lung volumes with
crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings. There is mild
pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart size is enlarged but
stable. No large areas of consolidation are seen.  There are no
pneumothoraces.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: 88yoF, Russian speaking, dCHF (preserved EF),
s/p AVR 3 years ago, presenting with symptomatic bradycardia and
some CP on ambulation. Transferred to CCU for dopamine infusion
and PPM placement, tolerated the procedure well and was
discharged home.
.
# Syptomatic bradycardia: Pt with hx of SSS w/o pacemaker as she
had previously been asymptomatic, now with fatigue, DOE and HR
in the 30s. SBPs were in 90s and the pt had CP but she was alert
and interactive. However, EKG and troponins did not suggest any
ischemia and the patient went for ppm placement. Patient
tolerated procedure well with improvement in her HR and systolic
pressures, she had resolution of symptoms with pacer placement.
Post procedural CXR demonstrated no effusions or pneumothroax
and correct placment of leads.
.
# Hypotension: Patient had episode of hypotension to the 90s and
concurrent chest pain.  There were no other symptoms or
laboratory abnormalities. Amlodipine, enalapril were transiently
held and started her on dopamine infusion at 5/hr and gave
250+500cc of IV NS.  This was felt to be related to her
bradycardia and improved after placer placement.

# Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure:   Patient had no symptoms or
exam findings suggestive of an acute exacerbation though did
have pulmonary edema noted on CXR and hyperkalemia.  She was
given IV lasix dose x1.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: patient presented with a Cr of 2.7, with a K of 6.6 and
Na of 129.  Felt to be prerenal in the setting of poor forward
flow and kidney hypoperfusion. Hyperkalemia was treated with
calcium gluconate, kayexcelate, insulin and fluids. Cr improved
to 2.4 in after pacer placement.

# CAD: pt had CP but cardiac enzymes and EKG were negative for
signs of ischemia. We continued ASA 81 and atorvastatin

# DM: stable. Last Hba1c 6.5, Oral antihyperglycemics were held
on admission and patient was discharged on home metformin and
glipizide.

# Dementia: stable. We continued donepezil 10mg

# GERD: stable. We continued omeprazole
.
