Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Focal apical
hypokinesis of RV free wall.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
PRE BYPASS
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall of the right ventricle. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST BYPASS
Preserved biventricular systolic function. There is a well
seated well functioning bioprostheisi in the aortic position. No
AI is visualized. MR remains mild to moderate.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

CHEST (PA & LAT) PORT  [**2146-10-8**] 1:38 PM
PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**2146-10-8**] AT 13:39
INDICATION: New pacemaker.
FINDINGS: A pacemaker hardware of a dual-chamber device is
visualized over the left anterior soft tissues. The wires are
intact and the tips are appropriately located. Note is made of
prior aortic valve replacement. There are bilateral pleural
effusions similar to that noted on the prior film from [**2146-10-6**].
No airspace consolidations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-3**] and underwent AVR/CABG x1 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on titrated propofol
and phenylephrine drips.Extubated that evening and transferred
to the floor on POD #1 to begin increasing her activity level.
She was gently diuresed toward her preoperative weight. On
[**10-6**], she suffered a bradycardic cardiac arrest with full code
in the early AM hours. Paced via epicardial wires with no
neurologic deficit apparent. Transferred intubated back to the
CVICU, and extubated later that day. EP consult done to plan for
pacer, and pt. went into Afib in the interim. Treated with
amiodarone. Pacer inserted [**10-7**], and interrogated on the 27th .
Epicardial wires removed and transferred to the floor on POD #6.
Continued to make good progress and cleared for discharge to
rehab on POD #7. She was started on coumadin for paroxysmal post
op atrial fibrillation. Pt. is to make all followup appts. as
per discharge instructions.
