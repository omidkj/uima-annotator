Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
HA and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
82 y/o female with s/p AAA repair, HTN, CVA in [**2119**] presented to
the ED with complaints of HA, sore throat, chest pain with
inspiration, chronic cough, and tightness in head x 1 day. CXR
revealed left pleural effusion but no CHF or PNA. Due to
pulsatile HA there was concern for ICH so a head CT was
performed which revealed no ICH. She was treated with lopressor,
aspirin, levofloxacin and SLNTG. Due to CP and pulsatile HA with
hx of AAA there was concern for aortic and carotid dissection so
there was decision for MRA of the chest and head. She was unable
lay flat secondary to pain and orthopnea so she was electively
intubated for MRI. MRA/ MRI revealed no acute infarct or
dissection of intracranial or thoracic vessels. Due to
somnolence off of propofol and continued need for intubation she
was admitted to the ICU. While in the ICU she was treated with
levofloxacin for suspected PNA and ruled out for MI with CE x3.
TTE was performed due to concern that effusion was due to CHF
which revealed only minimal AS with preserved EF. She was
successfully extubated this afternoon.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2125-1-18**] 7:11 PM
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates
appropriate position of the endotracheal tube with tip
approximately 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube courses
through the stomach with tip below the inferior margin of the
radiograph. Otherwise, there has been no short interval change
in appearance of the chest. Given differences inpatient
positioning, a small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Calcified nodules are again noted at the base of the right lower
lobe. Mild cardiomegaly persists.
IMPRESSION: ET tube in appropriate
.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2125-1-18**] 8:59 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute infarct.
2. Atherosclerotic disease involving the cavernous ICA
bilaterally. The study is somewhat limited due to motion
artifacts.
3. Bilateral parotid masses, incompletely evaluated on the
present study.
.
MRA CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2125-1-18**] 8:59 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection. Mild atherosclerotic
disease of the thoracic aorta with an unfolded aorta.
2. Right lower lobe dependent atelectasis versus consolidation.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2125-1-18**] 1:39 PM
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with small vessel ischemic
disease. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or
territorial infarct.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2125-1-18**] 12:51 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Small left pleural effusion with no evidence of acute
parenchymal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
2. Small hiatal hernia. This may be better evaluated with
dedicated esophagram if clinically indicated.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2125-1-19**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left  ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber  size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately  thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
mitral annular calcification.  No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
RENAL U.S.  [**2125-1-20**] 9:09 AM
IMPRESSION: Multiple simple cysts in both kidneys. No evidence
of hydronephrosis.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2125-1-20**] 9:31 AM
IMPRESSION:
Worsening left-sided pleural effusion. Small right-sided pleural
effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o female with HTN, AAA s/p repair, CVA, smoking, chest pain
and H/A now with resolving hypoxia and acute on chronic RF.
.
# Respiratory Distress: differential includes pneumonia, COPD
exacerbation, acute on chronic bronchitis, heart failure
exacerbated by renal failure, or some combination of these
factors. Given markedly increased BNP it is likely that the
patient has some element of failure. Patient's ECHO is without
wall motion abnormalities.  The patient was treated with
Levofloxacin for empiric pneumonia for a total of 7 days.  The
patient was also given nebulizers as needed for symptomatic
relief.  During her hospital course her breathing gradually
improved.
.
# Acute on Chronic RF:  Initial FeNA > 1, although patient on
Lasix. Further urine studies suggested that the patient was not
pre-renal and her disease is likely a result of progressive
atherosclerotic disease.  She had a Renal US which was negative
for obstruction.  The patient's PTH was increased although
likely secondary to CRI.  Her creatinine peaked at 3.2 and then
decreased to 3.0 and she was discharged home with plans for
close follow up.
.
# s/p CVA, AAA repair:  Patient was continued on aspirin,
Lipitor, diltiazem-XR, but Metoprolol was held initially as per
renal in order to avoid renal hypoperfusion.
.
# Anemia: baseline HCT 31-34. Anemia appears to be iron
deficiency anemia.  Patient was started on iron supplementation,
plus some component of anemia of chronic disease, possibly from
renal failure.  She was started on Epogen.  An attempt was made
to have her insurance cover the cost of Epogen as an outpatient.
The family and patient asked to have this dealt with as an
outpatient.
.
# Hypothyroid:  Patient continued on levothyroxine
.
After discussion with the patient and the medical staff, all
were in agreement that [**Known firstname 100462**] [**Known lastname 100463**] was a suitable
candidate for discharge.
