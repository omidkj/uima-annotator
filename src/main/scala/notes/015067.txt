CT Abdomen/pelvis [**2154-1-30**]
1. Severely limited examination. Given the lack of intravenous
contrast and near absence of oral contrast, the study is
nondiagnostic for infection or diverticulitis as requested.
2. There is a large umbilical hernia which should be apparent on
clinical exam (though not provided in the given history). A gas-
distended loop of small bowel appears to enter and exit the
hernia sac without definite transition point. No proximal small
bowel dilatation, to CT criteria, is noted.
.
CXR [**2154-2-4**]
In comparison with the study of [**1-31**], there is again substantial
left pleural effusion. It is difficult to compare this upright
film with the previous semi-upright study, in which the effusion
layers out along the posterior chest wall.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. The degree of
pulmonary vascularity is essentially unchanged


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 78 yo M with h/o CAD, CHF (EF 35-40%), cardiac
cirrhosis, CRI, chronic GIB and anemia who presented with
abdominal pain, found to have acute on chronic renal failure and
worsened anemia thus admitted initially to the ICU then
transferred to the floor after stabilization.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.3-1.8,
3.3 on admission. Further investigation revealed that pt had
pre-renal failure due to dehydration and not hepatorenal
syndrome. Fluid rehydration with IVF as well [**Date Range 61990**] was done
with improvement in creatinine levels daily. Renal failure
resolved prior to discharge.
.
# Hypotension:  Pt was noromotensive on admission, however
developed hypotension after aggressive diuresis in the intensive
care unit. Hepatology and renal were consulted for the potential
of hepatorenal syndrome. However, pt was found to be mostly
dehydrated and IVF resusitation and [**Date Range 61990**] was aggressively
engaged. Pt did not have hepatorenal syndrome, hence midodrine
and octreotide that was initially started was stopped. His BP
improved and IVF, [**Date Range 61990**] was eventally discontinued. Pt has
remained normotensive since transfer from the unit.
.
# Anemia:  Chronic anemia with baseline hematocrit ~20-30's. Per
daughter, pt requires frequent blood transfusions ~q2weeks in
the setting of chronic GIB r/t AVM's. Pt received 5units PRBC
during this admission.
.
# CAD/NSTEMI: Pt developed NSTEMI during ICU stay in the setting
of renal failure, pt with known hx of CAD. There were no changes
on EKG. Pt not on aspirin due to h/o GIB, not started during
this admission. Lipids were at goal, hence statin was not
initiated.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Rate controlled on digoxin. Dig level 3.2
on admission, however held dose and redosed for dig levels < 1.
Pt's dig level
