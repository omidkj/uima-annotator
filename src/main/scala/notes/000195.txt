The patient was a 71-year-old man with history of severe
aortic stenosis, ischemic congestive heart failure with
ejection fraction of 10 percent to 15 percent, peripheral
vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who initially presented
to an outside hospital on [**2197-12-31**] with increasing lower
extremity edema, increasing shortness of breath, and
orthopnea.  The patient was found to have a peak troponin of
4.6 at the outside hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2198-1-4**] for catheterization and consideration of coronary
artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement.  On the
catheterization table, the patient became agitated and
confused and was intubated.  Catheterization showed 80
percent proximal LAD, 88 percent ostial diagonal 1, and 80
percent ostial OM1 stenosis as well as elevated filling
pressures.  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care
Unit for further management.  The patient became febrile,
started on multiple antibiotics, and his pulmonary status
continued to be grim.  After continued attempts at management
that were unsuccessful, the patient continued to be
hypotensive on multiple pressor agents as well as
hyponatremic and intubated on a ventilator.  After a family
meeting between the Coronary Care Unit team and the patient's
wife and family, decision was made to make the patient
comfort measures only; and the patient passed away on
[**2198-1-10**].
