Admission Date:  [**2139-8-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-10-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2093-5-6**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

ADDENDUM:  Since the last discharge summary, dictated on
[**2139-9-21**], there have been additional events during
this [**Hospital 228**] hospital course:

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient has been requiring less
ventilator support.  He was weaned down to ventilator
settings of pressure support of 5 and PEEP of 5 with 30%
FiO2, and was doing well on those settings.  Therefore, he
has been allowed to come off the ventilator for trial with
50% tracheostomy mask.  These trials should be no longer than
12 hours during the day, as the patient will begin to retain
carbon dioxide if left off of the ventilator for longer than
that.  He clinically does not become severely tachypneic,
however, in a recent trial, the patient was off of the
ventilator for over 24 hours and arterial blood gases
subsequently showed a pH of 7.15, pCO2 of 75 and pO2 of 60.
He also tolerates a Passe Muir valve well.  He has
significant secretions but he is able to clear them on his
own and suction them on his own with the Yankauer suction.
His oxygen saturations on the ventilator range from 93% to
98% and, when off the ventilator, range from the upper 80s to
low 90s.  The most recent ventilator settings which the
patient was rested on were a C-PAP and pressure support of 10
with 5 of PEEP at an FiO2 of 0.5.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient is hemodynamically stable
and continues on Isordil, hydralazine and clonidine for blood
pressure control.  At the time of discharge, he is becoming
more hypertensive, with blood pressures up to 170 systolic.
If further blood pressure control is necessary, a calcium
channel blocker should be considered to be added to the
regimen, as this is what the patient was on previously as an
outpatient, and a beta blocker was tried while admitted at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and resulted in the
patient with a subjective feeling of shortness of breath.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient, as stated in the
previous discharge summary, had been found to have
Enterococcal bacteremia, for which he was on ampicillin twice
a day.  He subsequently grew Enterococcus out of both new
line and a peripheral site.  He had a transthoracic
echocardiogram which revealed no evidence of endocarditis.
This was discussed with cardiology and infectious disease as
to whether the patient required a transesophageal
echocardiogram in order to definitively rule out
endocarditis.  It was decided that the patient had adequate
windows on the transthoracic echocardiogram and, as long as
subsequent blood cultures remained negative, it could
concluded that the patient did not have endocarditis.
Therefore, the patient's ampicillin dose was increased to 1
gram every six hours and surveillance blood cultures were
drawn repeatedly after the increased ampicillin dose.  All of
those cultures remained negative and the patient is to
receive his last dose of ampicillin at 6:00 p.m. on the day
of discharge.

The patient also grew Stenotrophomonas, which was drawn off
of his arterial line.  This line was pulled and he was
treated with Bactrim for a ten day course, and no further
blood cultures have grown Stenotrophomonas.  Finally, the
patient developed a vesicular rash on his left chest in a
dermatomal distribution around to his back, and dermatology
was consulted for this.  It was felt to be herpes zoster,
which was confirmed by culture.  He is currently on day six
of a ten day course with acyclovir, renally dosed, in order
to treat this.

4.  Renal:  The patient continues on hemodialysis three times
a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.  He had a
Perm-A-Cath placed on the right on [**2139-10-2**] after all
blood cultures had been negative from Enterococcus.  His
baseline creatinine is in the 3s on hemodialysis.  He does
not have problems with hyperkalemia.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient suffered an upper
gastrointestinal bleed on [**2139-9-30**].  On that day, he
was incontinence of loose black/brown stool overnight, which
were occult blood positive.  Nasogastric lavage was
performed, which was occult blood positive.  His hematocrit
went from 24.8 down to 21.4 with the bleed.  Gastroenterology
was consulted and an upper endoscopy was performed, which
found grade II esophagitis in the lower third of the
esophagus, an ulcer in the distal body of the stomach,
erythema, erosion and friability in the antrum, fundus and
cardia compatible with gastritis, and erythema, friability
and erosion in the duodenum compatible with duodenitis.  The
patient was eventually transfused with eight units of packed
red blood cells and he was placed on increased Protonix of 40
mg twice a day for three days, and he was evaluated for
Helicobacter pylori, which came back negative.  At the time
of discharge, the patient is back on a Protonix dose of 40 mg
daily and he is tolerating orals of soft solids without any
further evidence of bleeding.

6.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit has been stable in
the upper 20s since receiving his transfusion.  He continues
to receive Epogen three times per week as well.

7.  Dermatology:  Again, the patient was found to have herpes
zoster, for which he is currently in the middle of a ten day
course of acyclovir.  He also receives Domeboro solution
soaks to the zoster lesions twice a day for pruritus.  His
elephantiasis is improving on the Estar gel and the Hibiclens
soaks, and the Lotrimin cream, the doses of which are
outlined in the medication section of the discharge summary.

8.  Neurology:  The patient has left upper extremity weakness
which continues.  He was evaluated by neurology for this, and
it is felt that the patient most likely has nerve compression
secondary to a hematoma which formed after his tracheostomy
was placed.  The hematoma is slowly resolving.  The patient
could not be adequately imaged in order to evaluate this more
thoroughly due to his size.  Some plain films of the neck
were attempted to rule out any bony involvement which could
be contributing to compression, however, they also were of
suboptimal quality because of the patient's size.  The
recommendation of the neurology team at the time of discharge
is that the patient should receive an EMG one month after
discharge in order to assess ultimate prognosis.  He also can
follow up in the [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Country **] neurology clinic after the EMG
is performed.  The telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44**].  In
addition, once the patient is able to tolerate it, if
possible, he should get a neck and brachial plexus CT scan in
a facility which can accommodate weights greater than 350
pounds.  Finally, his pain should continue to be adequately
treated.  At the time of discharge, he is receiving Tylenol
#3 as needed.
