Admission Date:  [**2130-8-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-8-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2057-4-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
woman with known three-vessel coronary artery disease who
refused coronary artery bypass grafting in the past, admitted
two days prior to this admission with chest pain, ruled out,
refused catheterization at that time.  She now returns to
[**Hospital6 256**] with chest pain [**8-18**] x 2
hours associated with nausea and vomiting, unrelieved by
nitroglycerin.  In the emergency room the patient was noted
to be pain free after sublingual nitroglycerin as well as
intravenous nitroglycerin and intravenous heparin.

Her electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V3
through V6 resolved after the patient became pain free.  The
patient has agreed to undergo coronary artery catheterization
on this admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her past medical history is
significant for coronary artery disease.  She underwent a
catheterization in [**2125**], which showed three-vessel disease
including 80% right coronary artery, 90% left anterior
descending coronary artery, 80% circumflex, and an
echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] of this year, which showed normal left
ventricle and right ventricle with an ejection fraction of
55% and no abnormal wall motion activity.  Also, the patient
has diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension, as well as
hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Atenolol 25 mg once daily;
Isordil 20 mg t.i.d.; Plavix 75 mg once daily; Zestril 10 mg
once daily; NPH insulin 30 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m.;
Protonix 40 mg once daily; aspirin 325 once daily; and
Lipitor dose undisclosed.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  There is no tobacco use, no ETOH use.  The
patient lives alone and has supportive children who look in
on her frequently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission showed vital
signs afebrile, heart rate 90-120, blood pressure
100-130/70-80, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 96% on two
liters.  In general the patient appeared pale, weak, but in
no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat showed
mucous membranes moist; pupils equal, round and reactive to
light; extraocular movements intact.  Heart sounds showed a
regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmur, no jugular
venous distension.  Pulmonary examination was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdominal examination was soft,
nontender, nondistended; guaiac negative rectal examination.
Extremities were warm with no edema.  Neurological
examination was alert and oriented x 3, grossly intact.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  On admission the white count was 10.7,
hematocrit 29.9, platelet count 223, PTT 37.4, INR 1.1,
sodium 136, potassium 4.3, chloride 103, CO2 21, BUN 20,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 204, CK 352 with an MB of 12, and
troponin 21.2.

Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure or
infiltrates.

Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 115, normal
axis, normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V3 through V6;
[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in 2; T wave inversions in 2, 3, and V3
through 6, that was with 8/10 chest pain.  When the patient
was pain free after sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous
nitroglycerin as well as heparin, the electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 92 with [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depression in V4 and 5 and T wave inversions in V3 through 5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service with a diagnosis of unstable angina for cardiac
catheterization.  The patient was brought to the
catheterization laboratory.  Please see the catheterization
report for full details.  In summary, the catheterization
showed 40% left main, 90% left anterior descending coronary
artery, 95% circumflex coronary artery, and 90% right
coronary artery.  No ejection fraction was obtained at that
time.

The patient continued to experience pain during the
catheterization procedure and for that reason, an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed without complication.

Following the catheterization, CT Surgery was consulted.  The
patient was seen by CT Surgery and accepted for coronary
artery bypass grafting.

On [**2130-8-20**] the patient was brought to the operating room at
which time she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5
including a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, a vein graft to D2, a vein graft
to obtuse marginal #1 and obtuse marginal #3 sequentially,
and a vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At
the time of transfer the patient had an intra-aortic balloon
pump at 1:1 propofol, milrinone at 5 mcg per kg per minute,
Neo-Synephrine and nitroglycerin infusing.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthetics were reversed.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and extubated, however her balloon pump was left
in place, and she was left on her milrinone throughout the
course of her first operative day.

On postoperative day one the patient was weaned from the
intra-aortic balloon pump, which was discontinued at that
time.  She did, however, continue to require small doses of
milrinone to maintain adequate cardiovascular function.

On postoperative day two the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  Her cardiac function was good.  Her milrinone was
weaned to off and discontinued.  She did however, on that
day, experience an episode of atrial fibrillation, which was
treated with intravenous Lopressor and amiodarone, after
which an initial loading dose the patient converted to normal
sinus rhythm.  Also on postoperative day two the patient's
chest tubes and Foley catheter were discontinued, and she was
transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care
and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next several days the patient's activity level was
slowly progressed with the assistant of physical therapy.
She remained hemodynamically stable, and on postoperative day
five it was deemed that she was stable and ready for transfer
to a rehabilitation setting for continuing postoperative care
and cardiac rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer the patient's physical examination
was as follows:  Vital signs - temperature 98.8, heart rate
80 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 145/85, respiratory rate
18, O2 saturation 96% on room air.  Her weight preoperatively
was 92.2 kg; at discharge was 97.4 kg.

Laboratory data showed an hematocrit of 28, potassium 4.2,
BUN 22, creatinine 0.9, magnesium 2.

The patient was alert and oriented x 3, moved all
extremities, followed commands.  Her breath sounds were clear
to auscultation on the right, diminished at the left base [**1-11**]
of the way up.  Heart sounds were regular rate and rhythm, S1
and S2, no murmurs.  Sternum was stable, incision was with
Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended; positive bowel sounds with
well-healed scars from a prior cholecystectomy and
hysterectomy.  Extremities are warm and well perfused with 2+
edema.  Left leg incision had Steri-Strips, open to air,
small amount of serosanguinous drainage from the upper thigh.
