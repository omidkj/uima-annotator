pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Soft tissue are unchanged.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities are identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
1) DYSPNEA - The patient presented with complaints of dyspnea,
which likely represented a COPD exacerbation.  In addition,
there was most likely also an associated bronchitis given his
fever and leukocytosis.  He was initially admitted to the MICU
for "looking bad" in the ER.  For his COPD flare, he was started
on prednisone and eventually tapered, continued on salmeterol,
albuterol and ipratropium nebs.  He was also started on Azithro
for presumed bronchitis.  The day following admission, the
patient was transferred to medical service for further
management.  He was continued on the above mentioned therapy and
discharged home the following day.  He was given a longterm
steroid taper at the time of discharge.
.
3) CAD - There were no signs of ischemia on this admission.  He
was continued on his outpatient doses of [**Month/Day/Year **], statin, ACE, and
calcium channel blocker.  Betablockers were not given due to
COPD exacerbation.
.
4) LOW BACK PAIN - This is a long-standing, chronic issue. He
was continued on his outpatient therapy with percocet.
.
5) PROPHYLAXIS - Given his baseline steroid use, VitD and
Calcium were initiated on this admission.  He also also received
a PPI and RISS for steroid use during this admission.  Bactrim
was not started on this admission.
