Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the OR for an attempt to use a burr
hole to evacuate the subdural hematoma. Unfortunately, multiple
membranes were encountered and the repeat head CT did not show
significant improvement of the subdural hematoma. Based on that
and after discussion with the family, it was decided to take the
patient back to the operating room to perform a large craniotomy
for evacuation of the subdural and also removal of the subdural
membranes. The patient was monitored in the ICU postoperatively,
then transferred to the stepdown unit on post op day 1. He went
into atrial fibrillation, Diltiazem was initiated, and he was
transferred back to the ICU. He had one episode of a 3-second
pause in the ICU. Diltiazem was discontinued and an Amiodarone
drip started. He converted back to normal sinus rhythm. The
patient was asymptomatic throughout this episode of dysrhythmia.
A transthoracic echo revealed an EF 50-55%, [**1-9**]+ MR, mild
symmetric LVH. The patient was given oral Amiodarone and he was
transferred to the floor on post op day 3. Please evaluate
pateint thyhroid function, liver functions, and eye exam
periodically while on amiodarone.Coumadin can be started 2 weeks
from surgery date on [**2101-11-25**].
He was evaluated by PT/OT who recommended discharge to
rehabilitation.
