Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
Polytrauma - found down likely after fall from ladder

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation ([**2170-5-10**])
Left paravertebral catheter placed ([**2170-5-11**])
Left chest tube placed ([**2170-5-11**])

History of Present Illness:
76 yo male with hx of dementia, CAD, recent falls transferred
from an OSH after sustaining an unwitnessed fall on [**Location (un) 7453**]. Patient was found down in the garden and does not
recall event. At OSH, patient was found to have a SDH and SAH as
well as multiple rib fx. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. Upon arrival here, patient was pan scanned
and seen by neurosurgery. He was loaded with keppra. His TLS
spine was cleared but his c-spine is still in a collar. Patient
also has significant EtOH hx per report, though EtOH negative
here.  Per further discussion with the family it seemed as
though there was a ladder nearby and he may have fallen and then
tried to walk home before collapsing.  His toxicology screen on
admission was negative.

Pertinent Results:
CT head ([**2170-5-8**]): Left tentorial and parafalcine subdural
hemorrhage and left frontal and parietal subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Punctate amount of intraventricular hemorrhage
within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].

CT cspine ([**2170-5-8**]): No acute fracture or malalignment; no
significant canal stenosis.

CT torso ([**2170-5-8**]): Small left hemopneumothorax with extensive
left-sided rib fractures including segmental fractures of ribs
two through six, as well as rib eight.  Mildly displaced
fracture of the inferior body of the left scapula. Comminuted
left distal clavicular fracture.  4.8 x 4.6 cm infrarenal aortic
aneurysm. Mild pulmonary edema with bibasilar atelectasis.

CT head ([**2170-5-9**]): Partial interval resorption and/or
redistribution of left frontal lobe subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Tiny layering hemorrhage within the occipital horns of the
lateral ventricles is new on the right and increased on the
left.  New right frontal lobe hyperdensity could be represent
redistributed SAH or a small focus of parenchymal hemorrhage at
the grey-white matter junction, perhaps secondary to diffuse
axonal ("shear") injury.  SDH overlying the left leaflet of the
tentorium cerebelli is unchanged, while parafalcine SDH is
decreased.

CT head ([**2170-5-11**]): No new acute intracranial hemorrhage or major
vascular territory infarction.  Interval
redistribution/resorption of subarachnoid and subdural
hemorrhage. Probable minimal increase in blood products within
the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. Possible shear
injury involving the posterior corpus callosum. Consider MRI for
further evaluation as clinically indicated.

MRI head ([**2170-5-12**]): Subarachnoid and subdural blood products
identified as on the prior CT. Signal changes in the splenium of
corpus callosum, left frontal lobe as well as susceptibility
abnormalities along the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction are
suggestive of diffuse axonal injury. No territorial infarcts are
seen.

CXR ([**2170-5-17**]): ET tube is in standard placement, no less than 7
cm from the carina, although it is at the level of the lower
margin of the clavicles. Pulmonary edema superimposed on
residual abnormalities in both lungs due to ARDS and multifocal
pneumonia has improved slightly since earlier today. Small right
pleural effusion is likely. Heart size is top normal and
mediastinal veins are still distended. No pneumothorax.
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**5-9**]: The patient was admitted to the Trauma ICU from the ED.  He
was initially maintained on an oxygen facemask.  Neurosurgey was
consulted for his SAH and SDH and felt reimaging the next day
was appropriate and surgical intervention was not intubated at
that time. His head CT was repeated and showed just
redistribution of blood.

[**5-10**]:  Epidural placement was attempt for discomfort and
difficulty breathing but the patient was unable to tolerate
procedure.  His respiratory status worsened with desaturations
despite 100% O2 facemask and he was ultimately intubated for
airway protection.

[**5-11**]: A left sided paravertebral catheter was placed to help with
pain control given desaturations on CPAP ventilator mode.  His
post-placement CXR demonstrated worsening of his previously seen
left sided pneumothorax and a left sided chest tube was placed
with 300cc of old blood out and improvement in his pneumothorax.

[**5-12**]: A repeat head CT was obtained given change in mental status
which was unrevealing, and neurology was consulted.  A head MRI
was obtained which demonstrated moderate [**Doctor First Name **].  The patient was
minimally responsive at that time and mental status failed to
significantly improve throughout the rest of his
hospitalization.  Sputum cultures were sent which demonstrated
H.influenza and moderate streptococcus pneumonia, and he was
started on levaquin.  He continued to spike fevers and was
changed to vanco and zosyn.  Free water flushes were added for
hypernatremia.

[**5-13**]: A family meeting was held and the patient was made DNR with
no further escalation in care.  He respiratory status continued
to decline with inability to tolerate CPAP and thick secretions.

[**5-14**]:  Propofol was added for dysynchrony on the ventilator -
sedatives had previously been held for concern for depressed
mental status.  Discussions were made to hold a family meeting
on Thursday [**5-17**].

[**5-15**]:  His paravertebral catheter was dc'ed and fentanyl and
oxycodone were added.  His chest tube was dc'ed.  His tube feeds
were held for high residuals.

[**5-16**]:  His respiratory status continued to worsen despite
diuresis.  He continued to be unable to tolerate tube feeds.

[**5-17**]:  A family meeting was held with the patient's daughter,
grandchildren and girlfriend.  The decision was made to make the
patient CMO with terminal extubation.  The patient expired
shortly thereafter.
