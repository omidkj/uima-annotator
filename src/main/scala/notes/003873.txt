Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement [**2129-8-11**]


History of Present Illness:
67F with h/o of CVA (L hemiparesis), NIDM, CRI, HTN, HLD, CAD
s/p CABG with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG-OM2 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2129-7-27**] and was discharged to [**Hospital **] rehab on [**2129-8-4**]. She was
improving at rehab but developed left substernal chest pain
around 9 pm last night of sudden onset and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

.
Last night at 9pm, the patient was watching TV when she noticed
sudden onset of left shoulder pain that eventually radiated to
her sternum and became substernal chest pain. The pain was at
first stabbing in sensation but later became a dull pressure
that reminded her of her previous MI. Her pain worsened with a
cough as well as inspiration. It did not seem to worsen with
exertion, although she is primarily bedbound since the surgery.
She also reports the pain worsens with lying flat and improves
while leaning forward. She denies any associated SOB,
diaphoresis, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, numbness/tingling of
her extremities. She reports 6-pillow orthopnea and feels
uncomfortable while lying flat currently. She denies recent PND,
palpitations, lightheadedness, edema.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.5 P 58 BP 115/68 R20 O2 sat100%
on 2L. Patient was found to have an elevated WBC to 13.8, with
increased b/l pleural effusions and a possible new infiltrate on
CXR. Her troponin is 0.5 x2 and she has slight t wave inversions
in V3-V6 which are new from previous EKG. BNP was noted to be
[**Numeric Identifier 106637**]. Cr. is stable at 2.1. She was given vanco/levoflox for
treatment of presumed HAP. Chest pain responded to nitro gtt,
given plavix as patient is allergic to aspirin. Currently, chest
pain free. On review of her micro, noted to have had recent
pan-sensitive pseudomonas UTI. Consulted Cards and CT surgery.
.
On the floor, she was found to be in [**4-30**] chest pain and [**8-30**]
when she takes a deep breath. She was on a nitro gtt. She was
actively orthopneic.
.

ECG [**2129-8-8**]: Sinus bradycardia. Consider inferior myocardial
infarction of indeterminate age. RSR' pattern in lead V1 with
early R wave progression. Other ST-T wave abnormalities. Since
the previous tracing of [**2129-7-27**] the axis is less right inferior.
The QRS complex is narrower. T wave abnormalities are probably
more prominent. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CXR [**2129-8-9**]: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are
low. There are bilateral small pleural effusions which are
slightly increased in size since the previous study. There is
bibasilar atelectasis which as slightly improved at the left
base since the prior study. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mild
central pulmonary vascular prominence is again seen, unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax. Midline sternotomy wires remain
intact. IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions have slightly
increased in size since the previous study.

TTE [**2129-8-9**]: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-7-22**], the findings
are similar.

Bilateral Lower Ext Veins US [**2129-8-10**]: No evidence of DVT in the
lower extremities.

Unilateral Upper Ext Veins US (Left): No evidence of DVT of the
left upper extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 67yo female with h/o of CVA (L hemiparesis),
DM, CRI, HTN, HLD, CAD s/p CABG [**2129-7-27**], admitted from [**Hospital **]
rehab after the acute onset of sharp, substernal chest pain on
the night of [**2129-8-8**].

#) Chest pain: Patient c/o sharp substernal chest pain,
non-radiating, and worse with inspiration.  ECG revealed diffuse
T wave inversions, which were concerning for possible cardiac
ischemia.  However, pain seemed more consistent with pleuritic
chest pain than with angina, and patient ruled out for an MI
after cardiac enzymes were negative x3.  Other differential
diagnoses for chest pain included PE, pericarditis, pneumonia,
and infection of her sternotomy incision.  She had bilateral
lower extremity venous ultrasounds, which did not reveal any
evidence of DVT, as well as a left upper extremity venous
ultrasound, which also did not reveal any DVT.  The patient was
started on vancomycin and cefepime for po
