Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath on [**12-20**] - stent to LAD
s/p Intra-aortic balloon pump on [**12-20**] - no complications


History of Present Illness:
84 yo M c significant h/o CAD, atrial fibrillation, s/p
pacemaker placement for Sick Sinus [**Hospital 54531**] transferred from OSH
for anterolateral STEMI after elective total b/l knee
replacements. Pt recently had cardiac cath in [**2-11**] for anginal
symptoms resulting in PCI with cypher stents placed in the Left
Circumflex and LAD. Patient also had an MI approximately 10
years ago. Bilateral total knee replacements performed at the
OSH without complications and with minimal blood loss.  Post op
in the PACU, patient developed CP, diaphoresis, and SOB.
Initial EKG at OSH showed afib, prominent ST elev in v2-v6, 1,
and aVL, and ST depressions in inferior leads.  Patient was
loaded on ASA, plavix, Heparin, Integrillin, and tranferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for catherization.  ASA and Plavix had been discontinued
one week prior to the procedure.  Catherization at [**Hospital1 18**] showed
100% proximal stent restenosis, diffuse RCA disease, and a
patent Left Circumflex stent. A PTCA [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was successfully
placed in LAD with restoration of TIMI 3 flow.  The
catherization was complicated by the development of wide complex
tachycardia and hypotension (SBP 80s).  As a result, the patient
was defibrillated once, given IV lopressor, IV Amiodarone,
Dopamine pressor, an Intraaortic Balloon Pump, and intubated to
protect airway.  The patient als developed persistent distal LAD
spasm and treated with Nitroglycerin IC and Nipride.
Hemodynamics at time of Catherization were: RA 18, PCWP 27, PA
53/30, CO 3.16, CI 1.53.  Enzymes post catherization: CPK 4741,
Troponin 14.95.  Of note, Persantine MIBI [**9-12**] showed small
fixed inferior defect with slight atypical redistribution
suggestive of ischemia.    Echo also done [**9-12**] showed normal
LVEF of 60%, concentric LVH, and moderate MR.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-12-23**] 8:23 AM

IMPRESSION: Bilateral effusions, otherwise no change since the
prior chest x ray.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2198-12-22**] 10:38 AM

INDICATION: Large ST elevation with myocardial infarction.
Hematocrit drop. Assess for retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are small bilateral
pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis. There is
a Swan Ganz catheter from a right femoral approach, along with
an intra-aortic balloon pump. The balloon pump tip is not
visualized. Please corellate with chest radiographs for
positioning. Pacemaker leads, and an NG tube are present.

Evaluation of the abdominal organs is limited without IV
contrast. There is no fluid adjacent to the liver or spleen. The
gallbladder shows increased attenuation, likely from vicarious
excretion of contrast from prior studies. The spleen, pancreas,
adrenal glands, stomach, and bowel loops are all unremarkable.
There is a low attenuation lesion in the upper pole of the left
kidney which is not fully evaluated without IV contrast, and
measures 2.7 x 2.8 cm. Vascular calcifications are present in
the aorta and splenic vessels.

There is no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is minimal stranding
adjacent to both femoral arteries and veins, related to prior
vascular punctures. Note is made of a percutaneously placed line
into the left femoral artery. This terminates in the common
iliac artery. The bladder contains a Foley catheter. There is no
free fluid in the pelvis.

Extensive degenerative changes are seen throughout the spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild stranding about both femoral arteries in the groin,
related to prior vascular access procedures. No significant
hematoma. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Aortic balloon pump from right femoral artery. Vascular
catheter in left common femoral artery.
3. Small pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions.

ECHO

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal
views. Resting
tachycardia (HR>100bpm). Based on [**2191**] AHA endocarditis
prophylaxis
recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk
(prophylaxis not
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be
based on clinical and echocardiographic data. Left pleural
effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. No left ventricular aneurysm is seen.
There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the basal
septum and akinesis of the more distal septum and lateral wall
and basal
anterior wall. The more dital anterior wall and apex are mildly
dyskinetic. No
left ventricular thrombus is seen. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root
and ascending
aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Physiologic
mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The pulmonary
artery systolic
pressure could not be estimated. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction and
distal right ventricular hypokinesis c/w CAD.
