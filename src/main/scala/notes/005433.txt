History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 year old male with End Stage Renal Disease
secondary to  hypertension, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 498**] [**Hospital1 1559**]
with an infected right groin hemodialysis line on [**2156-7-31**].  He
has had multiple access procedures, and the most recent
hemodialysis line was placed approximately two months ago by
[**Hospital1 18**] AV care. Due to his known central stenosis, a groin site
was chosen. For approximately one week, he has been having
yellow discharge around the catheter. He had HD on Friday, at
which time he had a temperature of 101 and yellow discharge.
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 498**], blood and wound cultures were obtained,
which grew Staph Aureus.  He was started on vancomycin, and the
catheter was removed.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with
bacteremia from infected hemodialysis line for continued
management.

Past Medical History:

parathyroidectomy

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 50%  >= 55%
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. PFO is
present.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV [**Known lastname **] thickness and cavity size.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV free [**Known lastname **] thickness. Mildly dilated
RV cavity. Mild global RV free [**Known lastname **] hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Aortic root abscess.
No AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Large vegetation on mitral valve. Abscess cavity adjacent to
mitral valve. No MS. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**2-1**]+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR [**Known lastname **] MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. A patent foramen ovale is present.
3. Left ventricular [**Known lastname **] thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
4. The right ventricular free [**Known lastname **] thickness is normal. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
[**Known lastname **] hypokinesis.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. An aortic annular
abscess is seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is a large vegetation on the mitral valve. There is an
abscess cavity seen adjacent to the mitral valve. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a perforation
seen of the anterior leaflet.
7. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of epi, levo, vasopressin. AV pacing, then
sinus rhythm. Well-seated mechanical valve in the mitral
position with normal washing jets seen. Aortic valve is poorly
seen in the deep transgastric view. There is a small
transvalvular gradien of 15 mmHG. There is an eccentric
paravalvuklar leak that originates near the anterior mitral
leaflet side of the aortic annulus. The jet is mild to moderate.
The LVEF is now 40% with inferior hypokinesis. The RV is
severely hypokinetic and dilated. There is 2+ TR. The aortic
contour is normal post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Chest CT scan [**2156-8-30**]
A right lower lobe, air-fluid level containing, abscess is
unchanged, again 22
x 22mm. Note is also made of bilateral pleural effusions with
overlying
atelectasis/consolidation. Ground-glass opacities, such as that
in the right
upper [**Last Name (un) **] (4:56) are new, likely areas of developing
infection/inflammation.
Note is made of pericardial fluid, similar to [**0-0-0**].
Mediastinal gas has
resolved. A substernal hematoma is unchanged from [**0-0-0**].
Appearance of a
splenic infarct is unchanged. Patient is status post bilateral
nephrectomies,
aortic and mitral valve replacements. A right PICC traverses a
right
brachiocephalic vein stent. Extensive osseous sclerosis is
unchanged,
consistent with renal osteodystrophy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital6 15083**] to the
transplant surgery service at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2156-8-1**]. He is a 47 year
old male with End Stage Renal Disease secondary to hypertension,
who was admitted to [**Hospital1 498**] [**Hospital1 1559**] with an infected right groin
hemodialysis line on [**2156-7-31**].  He has had multiple access
procedures, and the most recent hemodialysis line was placed
approximately 2 months ago by [**Hospital1 18**] AV care. Due to his known
central stenosis, a groin site was chosen. For approximately 1
week prior to admission to [**Hospital1 498**] he had been having yellow
discharge around the catheter. He had hemodialysis on Friday, at
which time he had a temperature of 101 and yellow discharge.
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 498**], blood and wound cultures were obtained,
which grew Staph Aureus.  He was started on vancomycin, and the
catheter was removed.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with bacteremia from an infected
hemodialysis line for continued management. He was on the
surgical floors for several days when he became septic and
hypotensive requiring pressors and a transfer to the surgical
intensive care unit. An echo revealed severe mitral
regurgitation with large vegetations. A transesophageal
