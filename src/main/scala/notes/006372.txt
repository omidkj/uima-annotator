History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 45083**] is a 89 year-old gentleman with HTN, CAD, BPH,
Parkinson's disease presenting from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab nursing home
with episode of dark black stool 1 week ago and then 2-3 days
ago. This was associated with abdominal pain at that time.

unit hung in ED. Received 1 L NS. GI was consulted, recommended
transfusion and serial HCTs, NGT. Family refused NGT so no NG

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 45083**] is an 89 year-old gentleman with coronary artery
disease, hypertension and Parkinson's disease who was admitted
to the ICU with melena and a HCT of 19.
.
1. Acute Blood Loss Anemia/GI bleed - The patient was admitted
with hematocrit 19. Aspirin was held. The patient was treated
with pantoprazole IV BID and received 3 units of PRBCs, with
appopriate increase in hematocrit. Following the transfusion,
the patient's hematocrit remained stable at 26-28 for 24 hours
before falling to 17.0 in the setting of melena. The patient was
transfused 4 units PRBCs. Urgent EGD showed no evidence of upper
GI bleeding. Tagged red blood cell scan showed a sigmoid colonic
source that was not bleeding rapidly enough to be amenable to
angiography. The patient was given 2 enemas in preparation for
sigmoidoscopy, which was non-diagnostic secondary to a large
amount of melena in the patient's colon. Therefore, the patient
was prepped for colonoscopy, which showed diverticulosis. The
source of the patient's bleeding was felt to be diverticular. He
remained stable throughout his hospital course thereafter. The
patient was called out to the medical floor on [**2161-10-24**].  His
Hct stabilized at 30-32.  He will benefit from GI referral
within the next few weeks.
.
2. Parkinson's disease- Continued Sinemet and Mirapex per home
regimen.
.
3. CAD, native s/p MI - Held aspirin in setting of GI bleed.
Continued other medications.  [**Month (only) 116**] consider resuming Aspirin at
nursing home if Hct stable.
.
4. Urinary dysfunction - Continued tolterodine.  A foley
catheter was placed in the ICU, this was discontinued on the day
of discharge.  A voiding trial should be completed at rehab.
.
5. Hypoglycemia - On [**10-24**], the patient had hypoglycemia to the
40s in early a.m. This was felt to be secondary to malnutrition
in the setting of being NPO for a prolonged period of time. The
patient was treated with 1 amp of D50. His diet was advanced and
his glucose remained stable thereafter.
.
6. CKD, stage III: stable during admission
.
7. Leukocytosis: Chronic.  [**Month (only) 116**] have been exacerbated from acute
bleeding.
.
8. Depression: Continued celexa
