History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19940**] is a 74 year old with a history of R subcortical
periventricular infarct, HTN, hyperlipidemia, who presented as a
code stroke this morning after she was noted by her husband to
have acute onset of L arm and leg weakness and L facial droop
this morning.

Husband saw her well this morning at 7:45 (up, walking around
the house, doing dishes).  He left the kitchen for a few
minutes, and when he got back at 8:15 he found her on the floor
with L facial droop.  He called EMS and she was transported to
[**Hospital1 18**] (arrived at 9:10).  EMS described in their report that she
was A+O x 3, found on the floor.  Told EMS she "just felt weak
so I sat down." They noted L facial droop, slurred speech, L
sided weakness.  Pt. was unaware of her deficits, and insisted
she just needed to be helped up.

Initial ED exam was notable for pt. being awake and alert but
disoriented (thought she was at home, few days off on date) with
right gaze preference, left facial droop, left sided neglect,
left arm>leg weakness, and left upgoing toe. Patient was given
iv tPA at 10 am after head CT showed no bleed. Brain CTA and
perfusion was performed and showed a R MCA infarct and R MCA
clot and no flow in distal L-ICA.

Pt. was then transferred to interventional radiology.
Angiography was peformed and IAtPA was administered to distal
ICA and R MCA (12:15-12:45) with partial recanalization of the
L-ICA siphon.  She is now transferred to the ICU for further
management.

Past Medical History:
- TIA, [**2125**], per Dr.[**Name (NI) 16937**] [**5-23**] note: On a recent trip to
[**Country **] she suddenly had blurred vision and slurred speech.  She
went to see a neurologist in [**Country **] and her symptoms improved
over forty-eight hours.  However, a MRI showed a right
subcortical paraventricular infarct.  Echocardiograms, carotid
studies and studies of the circulation of the posterior system
were all normal.
- s/p hysterectomy
- angina in [**2121**], which necessitated an angioplasty and stent
- high cholesterol
- hypertension.
- breast cancer (DCIS), s/p resection [**10-25**] (no XRT or chemo)

Social History:
Lives with husband. [**Name (NI) **] h/o smoking.


Family History:
brother had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer

IMAGING:
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Fluoroscopic assistance was
provided to the speech pathologist.  Various consistencies of
barium were administered and the swallowing was evaluated for
aspiration or abnormalities in the phases of bolus formation and
swallowing.  There is no evidence of aspiration or penetration.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1. Patient is status post acute embolic
stroke of the right middle cerebral artery with developing right
caudate, basal ganglia, and right temporal lobe edema.

ECG: Sinus bradycardia. Baseline artifact. Normal ECG except for
the rate. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-10-15**] QTc
interval is slightly shorter. Otherwise, findings are similar.

Cardiology ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild [1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size and regional/global
systolic
function. Dilated ascending aorta. Mild aortic regurgitation. No
definite
cardiac source of embolism identified.

CTA HEAD & NECK W&W/O C & RECONS, CT BRAIN PERFUSION: Acute
embolic stroke at the right internal carotid artery-middle
cerebral artery junction. No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage and minimal findings on non-contrast CT in terms of
ischemia. CT perfusion imaging demonstrates a right middle
cerebral artery territory infarct. CTA demonstrates extensive
collateralization from leptomeningeal branches with supply to
the M2 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. No perfusion
demonstrated within the right M1 segment of the middle cerebral
artery.

CATH CAROTIDS & BRAIN: Long segment narrowing in the cervical
internal carotid artery on the right as well as total occlusion
in the distal cavernous portion of the right internal carotid
artery. After intra-arterial administration of tPA, there was
slight improvement in the carotid siphon as well as minimal
opacification of distal MCA branches.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: Status post acute embolic strok
