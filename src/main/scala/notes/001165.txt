HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old woman
with a complicated medical history who was admitted to [**Hospital3 15516**] Hospital on [**2171-3-3**] for small-bowel obstruction,
status post laparotomy and lysis of adhesions, who
postoperatively, was found to have line sepsis with MRSA. She
then was found to have abscessed.  This was percutaneously
drained on [**2171-3-26**] and she was found to have
vertebral osteomyelitis/diskitis at the level T4-T5, T11-T12,
and L2-L3.  She was seen by the Department of Neurosurgery at
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital where the decision was made for long-term
antibiotic treatment with Vancomycin and Rifampin.  No
surgery was planned at that time.  Apparently, the patient
was going to be discharged to rehabilitation on the day of
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**4-3**],
when the patient became lethargic and had a temperature to
103.8.  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 2910**]
briefly, where her initial blood pressure was in the 90s. The
patient was very lethargic there and ABG showed a blood gas
with pH of 7.39, carbon dioxide 39.6, and oxygen 79.  Chest
x-ray showed a right left lower lobe infiltrate.  She was
started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl and given hydrocortisone
200 mg since the patient is on chronic steroids.  Also, of
note, the patient had been given Levaquin and Diflucan at
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital for pneumonia and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] in the urine.
The patient was then transferred from [**Hospital6 1322**] to [**Hospital1 69**] for a
possible ICU bed.  Upon arrival to the emergency room, the
vital signs were blood pressure 148/56; heart rate 80;
temperature 98.6; respiratory rate 16; oxygen saturation 98%
on four liters.  The patient was alert and oriented.  She was
seemed stable from the Medicine Floor.  Repeat ABG there
showed a pH of 7.35, pO2 149, pCO2 40, on four liters by
nasal cannula.  The patient, on initial labs, was seen to
have a hematocrit of 25, decreased from 30, two days
previously.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient denied
headache, back pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria,
hematemesis, melena, or bright red blood per rectum.  She was
alert and oriented and conversant and stated that she felt
fine on admission.

Per medical history, osteomyelitis of the vertebral bodies of
L2 and L3, growing MRSA in blood cultures, diskitis at three
sites including T4 to T5, T11 to T12, and L2 to L3; psoas
abscess status post percutaneous drainage; polymyalgia
rheumatica on steroids chronically; hypertension;
rectovaginal fistula; parotid tumor status post right parotid
gland resection; bladder spasms and incontinence; macular
degeneration; depression/panic disorder, status post sigmoid
colectomy for diverticulitis; status post herniorrhaphy;
status post hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN, SULFA, AND
PERCOCET.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Her son is [**Name (NI) 892**] [**Name (NI) 42086**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 42087**].
She also has as sister who lives in [**State 2748**] and a
granddaughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, temperature was 98.0,
blood pressure 117/38, heart rate 76, respirations 14, oxygen
saturation 98% on four liters by nasal cannula.  GENERAL:
The patient was alert and conversant, frequently inattentive,
no acute distress, speaking full sentences.  HEENT:  Oral
thrush present, dry mucous membranes.  Pupils 0.5-mm, hard to
assess if reactive, constricted.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  NECK:  No lymphadenopathy.  CHEST:  Decreased breath
sounds at the right base with egophony at the right base.  No
wheezes, no rales, [**Last Name (un) **] catheter site at the right chest,
no erythema, nontender.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  No murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, with
right lower quadrant tenderness, no guarding, no rebound, no
mass, no hepatosplenomegaly, no psoas sign present.  No
[**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] sign.  BACK:  Diffuse thoracic and lumbar spine
tenderness.  EXTREMITIES:  No edema.  SKIN:  Maculopapular
rash over chest, neck, back, and posterior thigh.  There was
no sacral decubitus ulcer present.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The
patient was alert and oriented to person and date, knew
[**Location (un) 86**], but could not name the hospital.  Cranial nerves II
through XII intact.  EXTREMITIES:  Lower extremity:  Motor:
Hip flexion strength 3/5, dorsiflexion [**4-7**], plantar flexion
[**4-7**], hyperreflexic patellar reflexes, 3+ and symmetrical,
unable to elicit ankle jerks, toes downgoing and withdraws.
RECTAL:  Examination revealed guaiac negative with brown
stool.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count 5.5, hematocrit 25.5, platelet count 257,000.
Chem 7 remarkable for creatinine of 2.2, magnesium 1.1, AST
81, ALT 23, alkaline phosphatase 119, albumin 2.1, INR 1.6,
PTT 40.8, D-dimer greater than 1.0.  Urinalysis:  Positive
nitrites, 3+ blood, no leukocyte esterase, 2 to 5 red blood
cells, 5 to 10 white blood cells, no bacteria.

Culture data:  The patient had multiple negative blood
cultures dating from [**4-4**] through [**4-20**], which showed
no growth, regular cultures and microcytic cultures.  Urine
cultures were negative from [**4-4**] to [**4-11**] and then
positive for Pseudomonas greater than 100,000 from urine
cultures [**4-16**] and [**4-18**].  Stool cultures were negative
for C. difficile times four.  Tissue culture from the L2-L3
disk on [**4-15**], showed no growth.  Tissue culture L2-L3
bone on [**4-15**] grew MRSA.  Genital swab on [**4-15**], grew
MRSA.  Abscess from the psoas abscess site on [**4-12**] grew
Enterococcus.  CSF from the lumbar puncture on [**4-10**] was
negative.

Radiology:  Multiple chest x-rays done between [**4-4**] and
[**4-20**], initially showed a right lower lobe atelectasis and
left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia,
which improved over time and chronic mild CHF.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**4-4**], showed no
retroperitoneal bleed and atelectasis of bilateral lungs.
Repeat abdominal CT on [**4-22**] showed no evidence of
intraabdominal abscess, thickened wall of the sigmoid
consistent with circular muscle hypertrophy.  No CT evidence
for diverticulitis.  MRI of the spine on [**4-8**], showed
diskitis and osteomyelitis of T4-T5 and T11-T12 and L2-L3.
On [**4-8**], MR of the head showed old ischemic disease in the
brain stem with a tiny lesion present advanced
periventricular microvascular ischemic changes, left-sided
mastoiditis of uncertain age and generalized atrophy.  On [**4-19**], repeat MR of the spine and head showed no change from
the initial studies.  Echocardiogram on [**4-10**],
transesophageal echocardiogram showed no thrombus; no atrial
septal defect; mild LVH with LV function ejection fraction
greater than 55%, normal RV with mild aortic regurgitation,
tricuspid regurgitation and significant pulmonary
regurgitation.  Perforation was seen at the base of the
posterior mitral leaflet consistent with endocarditis of the
mitral and aortic valves.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by system)

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient initially came in on
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Aztreonam, Rifampin,
and Fluconazole for treatment of her psoas abscess and
vertebral osteomyelitis.  This was trimmed down to only
Vancomycin on admission.  She then developed a severe rash on
[**4-9**], approximately six days after admission.  It was not
clear to which drug this rash developed, but it was thought
most likely due to Ceftriaxone or Lasix.  Vancomycin was also
considered possibly, although remotely likely cause and this
was discontinued and the patient was started on Linezolid.
Transesophageal echocardiogram done [**4-10**] showed a probable
mitral valve perforation consistent with endocarditis, no
vegetations seen.  The patient had a lumbar puncture on the
8th.  CSF from this puncture was culture negative and had no
organisms on gram stain, 1+ PMN.  The psoas absces
