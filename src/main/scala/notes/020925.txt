History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year old female with pancreatic head mass, which is
newly identified incidentally. She came alone to the clinic
today after having seen Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from our oncology
group just yesterday.

Basically, she was getting a workup for dysphasia.  She was
asymptomatic otherwise.  The workup led ultimately to
identification of a mass in the head of the pancreas.  She has
had no weight loss and no steatorrhea.  She has no evidence of
diabetes.  She had an ultrasound-guided biopsy performed by
endoscopic ultrasound technique and this has shown cells
suspicious for adenocarcinoma.

Her only GI procedures of late has been the endoscopic
ultrasound performed on the [**2188-7-4**] and this showed biopsy
proven adenocarcinoma.  She has not been jaundiced and she has
not required stenting.

[**2188-7-16**] [**2188-7-16**] [**2188-7-21**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **]/ttl
DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Gallbladder (A-B):
1.  Chronic cholecystitis, mild.
2.  Cholelithiasis, cholesterol-type.
II.  Jejunum (C-D):
Within normal limits.
III.  Pancreatic neck margin (E):
1.  Tiny focus of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm, low grade
(PanIN I).
2.  No invasive carcinoma.
IV.  Whipple (F-AR):
1.  Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, see synoptic report.
2.  Multiple foci of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm, low
grade (PanIN I-II), including the uncinate area.
3.  Segments of stomach, duodenum, and bile duct; No tumor.
Pancreas (Exocrine): Resection Synopsis
MACROSCOPIC
Specimen Type:  Pancreaticoduodenectomy, partial pancreatectomy.
Tumor Site:  Pancreatic head.

    Greatest dimension:  2.0 cm.  Additional dimensions:  2.0
cm.
Other organs/Tissues Received:  Gallbladder, Jejunum.
MICROSCOPIC
Histologic Type:  Ductal adenocarcinoma.
Histologic Grade:  G2:  Moderately differentiated.
EXTENT OF INVASION
Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but
without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior
mesenteric artery.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN1a:  Metastasis in single regional
lymph node (see comment).
Lymph Nodes
    Number examined:  31.
    Number involved:  2.
Distant metastasis:  pMX:  Cannot be assessed.
Margins:
    Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:
        Distance from closest margin:  1.7 cm.  Specified
margin:  Pancreatic neck.
Venous/Lymphatic vessel invasion:  Absent.
Perineural invasion:  Present.
Additional Pathologic Findings:  Pancreatic intraepithelial
neoplasia -- highest grade: PanIN:  2.
Comments:  The tumor extends focally into the peripancreatic
adipose tissue. One of the lymph nodes involved with tumor is
due to contiguous spread.
Clinical:   Pancreatic cancer.
