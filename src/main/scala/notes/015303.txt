coffee ground emesis. Her Hct was stable at 39.

being worked up as an outpatient currently. She has had an EGD
that showed retained food and a gastric emptying study that
showed delayed empting.

In the ED, her SBP was in the 140s-160s, Hr 70-80, T 98.9 and
setting high 90s on RA, RR 18.

[**2162-7-19**]: Lt LENI: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT involving the
left lower extremity.

[**2162-7-19**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to low lung volumes
with no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Mild
cardiomegaly however could be related in part to AP projection.


[**2162-7-21**] EGD:
Erythema, erosion and granularity in the whole stomach
compatible with gastritis (biopsy)
Nodule in the antrum (biopsy)
Duodenum with significant retained fluid, possibly secondary to
poor motility or distal obstruction.
Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2162-7-21**]: Small bowel obstruction, with a
transition point in the mid- pelvis, without an identifiable
cause for the obstruction. No secondary findings to suggest
associated bowel ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
66F admitted for partial SBO. She was managed conservatively
with NGT decompression, IVF and NPO. She was followed closely by
the GI and surgery services. On [**7-25**], her NG tube was pulled w/o
complication, and she was started on a clear diet. However, she
began to have vomiting on the evening of [**7-27**], her NGT was
replaced on [**7-28**] and she was again made NPO. She underwent ex
lap, small bowel resection, LOA on [**7-30**].  Patient tolerated the
procedure well and was briefly taken to PACU prior to be
transferred to the surgical floor.  Patient's systolic BP was
185-190.  Patient was given IV Lopressor and hydralazine.
On POD2 patient became tachycardic with pulse 155-185.  EKG
showed narrow complex tachycardia SVT vs afib/flutter.  Patient
was transferred to ICU for CV management.  Patient was loaded
with esmolol drip at rate of 100mc/kg/min, IV lopressor.  Then
the patient rhythm became sinus.  Esmolol drip was continued and
lopressor was titrated up.
POD3:  Patient was weaned off esmolol drip and placed on home
dose of BP meds.  Lopressor IV was used PRN for HR>110.
POD4 ([**8-12**])

# UTI: Urine cultures showed greater than 100,000 E.Coli. She
completed a 3-day course ending [**2162-7-26**].
.
# Hypertension: Clonidine patch, IV metoprolol, IV Hydralzine
while NPO; home doses of diltiazem, atenolol, and PO clonidine
were restarted [ ]
.
# Diabetes Mellitus II: well-controlled on sliding scale during
admission.
.
# CAD: cont. lipitor, B-blocker; plavix was held as indication
unclear, especially peri-operatively.
.
# Schizoaffective disorder: continued Clozapine 100mg and
Wellbutrin SR
