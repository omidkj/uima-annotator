Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
61 year old female with h/o SCLC dx'ed '[**88**] s/p XRT, chemo, stem
cell rescue, and prophylactic TBI recently admitted for
respiratory failure with recurrent nonmalignant R pleural eff.
and pseudomonas pna. s/p intubation, trach/PEG, now returns from
rehab with respiratory distress per the physician caring for
her.  The patient had been weaned to trach collar before d/c to
rehab.  At rehab, she was placed on IMV and then switched to AC
on account of respiratory distress.  She had no increase in
secretion, cough, or fever.  She was noted to have PIPs in the
50s, RR 20-30, and diaphoresis.  At rehab, she had been diuresed
heavily, started on diltiazem, digoxin, andlopressor for rate
control of sinus tachycardia, prednisone for possible COPD
exacerbation.  She presented with a bicarbonate of 50 upon
return to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  RESP INSUFF:  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
report of respiratory distress at rehab.  The ddx included
pnuemonia, mucous plug, increasing effusion, bronchospasm from
BBlocker, and severe contraction alkalosis leading to increased
CO2  in a patient with limited pulmonary reserve.  Chest X ray
on admissions showed persistent R pleural effusion and no change
from her discharge film.  The patient underwent bronchospopy
upon admission and was found to have a large obstructing mucous
plug in the right mainstem along with copious secretions.  BAL
was sent.  Her antibiotics from her previous admission were
continued.  He respiratory status improved and she required less
ventilatory support.

2.  TACHYCARDIA:  likely driven by her medical illness and
possibly contributed by residual thyroid abnormalities.  LVEF
was depressed to 30- 40% on most recent echo likely secondary to
tachycardia or hypothyroidism (now being treated).  The
patient's heart rate improved.  She warranted a CAD evaluation
with likely dobutamine MIBI or echo however this was deferred to
when she was more stable from a pulmonary standpoint.
Cardiology consulted and felt that ischemic evaluation was
indeed warranted (dobutamine MIBI) when she was more stable from
a pulmonary standpoint.  An echo when patient weaned off vent
was also recommended.  An ACEi was added for afterload
reduction.  The patient was discharged to a weaning/pulmonary
rehab facility.

3.  MET ALK:  patient was vigorously diuresed with furosemide at
rehab and thus presented with a contraction alkalosis that
likely worsened her respiratory status.  Her diuretics were held
and her alkosis improved as did her resp. status.

4.  HYPOTHYROID:  she was continued on her thyroid replacement.
Patient was to be referred to endocrine at time of d/c.

5.  DM:  she was continued on humalog sliding scale and
fingerstick glucose monitoring.

6.  PROPH:  heparin SQ, venadynes, PPI

7.  F/E/N:  she was given tube feeds and the transitioned to a
PO diet after S+S evaluation.

8.  CODE:  FULL

9.  COMM:  with HCP, daughter.

10.  R LE EDEMA:  doppler was negative for DVT.
