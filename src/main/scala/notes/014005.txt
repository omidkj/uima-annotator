Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and underwent an uncomplicated L colectomy.
She was transferred stable to the recovery room and then to the
floor. She slowly made progress, her NGT was discontinued and
her diet was slowly advanced. She was OOB with physical therapy.
A surveillance CT scan was performed on POD4 which was negative
for metastasis but did demonstrated incidentally a thrombosed L
ovarian vein as well as occlusion of the left limb of her
aortobifem graft. At this point in time, the patient was
asymptomatic from these findings, was out of bed and tolerating
her diet. On POD7, however, she did complain of bilateral leg
pain and weakness. She also developed acute shortness of breath
and worsening leg pain. She was transferred to the ICU and a CTA
chest was performed to r/o PE and also LE dopplers were
performed to evaluate the patency of her aortobifem graft. CTA
was negative for pulmonary embolism but her doppler study
demonstrated no flow through either common femoral artery. At
this time, her bilateral LE were noted to be mottled and cool. A
stat cardiology consult was obtained and the patient was cleared
for emergent surgery with the [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] team where she underwent
bilateral thrombectomy of her aortobifem graft. She was
transferred intubated and stable to the ICU and was started on
argatroban for anticoagulation. Laboratory tests revealed that
the patient was HIT- and her cardiac enzymes peaked on POD8/1
with a troponin of 0.20. Cardiology did follow the patient and
recommended conservative therapy with beta blockade and ace
inhibitors as soon as she could tolerate po's. Patient was
extubated on POD [**8-10**] and was supported with intermittent
diuresis and close monitoring. She was restarted on a regular
diet and transferred to the step down unit on POD [**9-10**] where she
did well and began intensive physical therapy.  The pt.
continued to improve and on POD [**10-12**] her INR was therapeutic and
the argatroban gtt was discontinued.  From this point the pt.
was maintained on coumadin.  Also the evening of POD [**10-12**] the
pt. experienced 'heartburn' for which the floor nurse got an EKG
that showed similar findings as were noted on previous EKGs done
during this admission.  The pt. was watched closely over the
next couple of days and by POD 13/6 the pt. was ready for
discharge to a rehab facility for further physical therapy.  By
this time the pt. had been afebrile with stable vitals, was
tolerating a regular diet and pain well controlled on po pain
medication, she was voiding well on her own, and had been
working extensively with physical therapy.  Cardiology had
cleared the patient and recommended outpatient follow up. She
was discharged to rehab and will follow up with her PCP for
coumadin dosing and will follow up with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
