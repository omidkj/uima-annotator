Admission Date:  [**2190-12-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2190-12-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2121-8-31**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
woman with known coronary artery disease status post
Persantin MIBI on [**2190-2-5**] showing a moderate reversible
inferior defect at which time she had refused cardiac
catheterization.  Three days prior to admission, she
developed four out of 10 substernal chest pain which
continued through the night prior to admission actually
preventing her from sleeping.  She was brought to the
Emergency Department by ambulance where on arrival she had
2/10 chest pain with EKG showing biphasic T waves in III and
aVF, 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in II and III, 0.5 mm
depressions in I and aVL.

Labs are notable on admission for a CK of 267, troponin of 12
with a MB fraction of 47, index of 17.6.  She was initially
hypertensive to a systolic blood pressure of 170 in the
Emergency Department.  She received Lopressor IV times three.
She was started on a heparin drip and IV Nitroglycerin with
relief of her chest pain.  In addition, she was started on
aspirin, Plavix and Integrilin.  She was initially admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service, but transferred to the CCU for closure
monitoring and anticipation of cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease as above.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
50%.
4.  Paranoid schizophrenia.
5.  High cholesterol.
6.  History of TIA.
7.  Osteoarthritis.
8.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
9.  Hypothyroidism.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Klor-Con 10 mg.
2.  Mavik 1 mg q. day.
3.  Levoxyl 25 mcg q. day.
4.  Lasix 60 mg q. day.
5.  Isosorbide Mononitrate 30 mg q. day.
6.  Haldol 1 mg q. day.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin.
2.  Codeine.  Both of which lead to rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  Denies any history
of smoking or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the CCU, patient was
afebrile with a temperature of 98.5 F, blood pressure 113/37,
heart rate 76, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 97% on two
liters.  In general, she was alert and oriented.  She was
pain free.  Her carotids were 1+ bilaterally without bruit.
Lungs were clear to auscultation.  Heart was regular, rate
and rhythm without any audible extra heart sounds.  Her
abdomen was benign with normal bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Her extremities revealed no edema with
faint distal pulses.  Her skin findings were significant for
psoriasis.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  CBC revealed a white count of
7.4, hematocrit 35.8, platelets of 177.  Coags were within
normal limits.  Chem-7 was unremarkable except for BUN and
creatinine of 44 and 1.2 respectively.

At the time of admission to the CCU, a second set of cardiac
enzymes had been obtained which showed a CK of 356, MB of 65,
troponin at that time was 43.

EKG on admission to the CCU revealed sinus rhythm at 73 beats
per minute, normal axis, QTC of 453, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in
II, III and aVF, Q waves were now present in II, III and aVF
as well with T wave inversions in I and aVL.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A. Coronary artery disease:  The patient
was continued on heparin and Integrilin drips, aspirin, beta
blocker, Lipitor, Plavix and her ACE inhibitor in
anticipation of cardiac catheterization.  Cardiac
catheterization was performed on [**2190-12-6**].

Hemodynamics from cardiac catheterization revealed a cardiac
output of 5.32 and a cardiac index of 3.04 by the Fick
method.  Wedge pressure was 8.  PA pressure 32/13 with a mean
of 22.  Left heart cath revealed mild LV diastolic
dysfunction with mild to moderate aortic stenosis.  LV gram
showed ejection fraction of approximately 60%.  Angiography
revealed right dominant system with 50 to 60% left main
coronary artery lesion.  LAD had an 80% distal lesion.  Left
circumflex had an 80% stenosis at the origin and right
coronary artery had a 95% osteo stenosis and 70% mid vessel
stenosis with TIMI-II flow into the distal AV groove.

Following cath, she was continued on aspirin and Integrilin
to be on for 18 hours.  Plavix was not continued as the
patient did not have any intervention.  It was recommended
based on the cath results of left main disease with three
vessel disease, that the patient undergo coronary artery
bypass grafting.

Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted to evaluate the patient
for surgery.  Initially patient refused coronary artery
bypass and a question was raised of the patient's competence
to make medical decisions given her history of paranoid
schizophrenia and occasional episodes of confusion.
Psychiatry was consulted who deemed her competent to make her
own decisions.  CT Surgery saw her and explained the
procedure, risks and benefits that go along with it.  Again,
after being deemed competent, she opted against the surgery
and was managed medically.  She was discharged with the
understand that she could undergo surgery in the future.

B.  Pump:  Following cardiac catheterization, the patient
creatinine bumped to 1.8.  Her ACE Inhibitor was held at that
time.  An echocardiogram was done to evaluate her LV function
which revealed a mildly enlarged left atrium, mild LVH with
impaired relaxation.  Ejection fraction of 30% down from 50%
in [**2190-1-12**], moderate to severe hypokinesis of the
inferior, posterior and lateral walls and apex.  The right
ventricle seemed to be dilated with depression function.
Aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened, but not
stenotic.  She had trace AI and 1 to 2+ MR.

She had moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
without pericardial effusion.  She was diuresed on a p.r.n.
basis with Lasix for pulmonary edema with improvement of her
creatinine from 1.8 down to 1.4 prior to discharge.  Because
of her need for afterload reduction, her ACE inhibitor was
restarted at her previous dose.

C.  Rhythm:  The patient was given Lopressor titrated up to
75 mg of Toprol XL q. day for rate control.  She was in sinus
rhythm throughout her hospitalization.

2.  PSYCH:  Patient has a history of paranoid schizophrenia
for which he had been on an outpatient regimen of Haldol 1 mg
q. day.  After cardiac catheterization, she was very
agitated and Psychiatry was consulted regarding further
management of her schizophrenia.  It was recommended at that
time to increase the Haldol that she received from 1 to 2 mg
q. four to q. six hours on a p.r.n. basis.

In addition, they recommended withholding any further use of
Ativan or Ambien which could have contributed to her delirium
at the time.  In addition, Psychiatry was consulted to
evaluate the patient in terms of competency to make decisions
regarding her cardiac surgery which the consultants did feel
that she was competent.

Her mental status cleared and her Haldol was decreased to its
outpatient dose of 1 mg p.o. q. day.  She was alert and
oriented times three at the time of discharge understanding
the risk and benefits of the coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery.  She agrees to talk to her primary care physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1169**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11422**] to assist her in making the decision of
having this surgery in the future.  She was discharged on
Haldol 1 mg p.o. q.d. as she had been taking on admission.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  On the day of discharge without any obvious
source of bleeding, the patient was found to have a
hematocrit of 26.7.  Given her significant coronary artery
disease, she was transfused with one unit of packed red blood
cells prior to discharge.

3.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was continued on her outpatient
dosage of Synthroid.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Toprol XL 75 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Trandolapril 2 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Haldol 1 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Synthroid 25 mcg p.o. q. day.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
