Service:  NEUROMED

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post fall with left parietal
hemorrhage.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86-year-old right
handed woman with coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction and a history of atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin who presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] status post a fall.  She was apparently having a
conversation with her son at about 2:30 in the afternoon, and
was mildly confused, but this was apparently consistent with
earlier episodes of intermittent confusion.  Approximately
4:30 that afternoon, her sister found her on the floor with a
laceration on the head, and the patient was disoriented.

She was brought to the [**Hospital1 69**]
emergently, and brought to the Emergency Department for
evaluation.  There, in the Emergency Room, a head CT scan was
done emergently which showed an 11 mm left parietal
hemorrhage with evidence of bleeding into the right
ventricle, right posterior occipital-temporal horns of the
lateral ventricle.  Initially, her systolic blood pressure
was in the 230's, and she was therefore started on a Nipride
drip and admitted to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
2. Atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Toprol XL 100 mg po q day.
2. Warfarin 5 mg po q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone, drives her car
during the day.  She has no history of smoking, alcohol, or
drug abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.  Mother was long
lived to [**Age over 90 **] years of age.  The patient does have a brother
who has apparently had a stroke.

EXAM UPON PRESENTATION:  Examination upon admission, blood
pressure 230/96-187/92 on the Nipride drip.  Her heart rate
was 108, respiratory rate was 18.  Initially, the patient
seemed to be in no apparent distress with cervical collar in
place and also with a 2 cm laceration on her left occiput.
Her cardiovascular exam revealed an irregularly, irregular
rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen is soft and has
positive bowel sounds.

NEURO EXAM:  The patient was initially able to answer all
questions by yes and okay.  She was also able to say her
name.  She did not have fluent speech initially.  Cranial
nerves:  Pupils were 2.5 mm bilaterally and reactive to 2 mm.
The face appeared symmetric.  Motor exam:  The patient had
good tone in all four extremities and actively resisted.
Reflexes:  Are brisk but symmetric, and the toes were upgoing
bilaterally.

LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  Sodium 141, potassium 3.9,
chloride 104, bicarb 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.7, glucose 108,
amylase is 78, lipase is 37.  White count is 6.6, hematocrit
34.2, platelets of 279.  Urinalysis was unremarkable except
for some trace protein.  An INR was 2.1 on admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Intracerebral hemorrhage:  The patient was admitted to the
Neuro Intensive Care Unit after initial management in the
Emergency Room with fresh-frozen plasma and vitamin K.  She
was placed on the Nipride drip to maintain her blood pressure
less than systolic BPs of 150.  She was intubated and placed
on propofol for sedation.  She was intubated and kept in the
Neuro Intensive Care Unit, and given serial head CT scans,
who showed initially an increase in the size of the left
parietal and right intraventricular bleed.

Neurosurgery was consulted, and it not felt that a
ventricular drain was needed.  Serial head CT scans were
continued, and did not show any further extension of her
parietal hemorrhage.  She remains in Neuro Intensive Care
Unit, and weaned to extubation, and had some atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and some
hyponatremia initially which resolved on its own.  She was
converted over to po metoprolol for her blood pressure
control and was transferred to the Neurology floor for
further management.

Her neurologic examination revealed increasing alertness
after extubation and discontinuation of the propofol drip.
She was able to follow commands and gradually became more
alert and more responsive and more conversant.

She continued to improve, in terms of her mental status,
becoming more oriented and felt that she should start aspirin
at least a week and a half or two after the initial bleed
event, especially given that the patient had atrial
fibrillation without any anticoagulation on board.

2. Atrial fibrillation:  As mentioned, the patient was
discontinued off her anticoagulation and reversed initially
for the left parietal bleed.  She was on the Neurology floor,
and had an episode of acute respiratory distress the [**8-4**], and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
closer respiratory monitoring.  She had a CT angiogram of the
chest which revealed subsegmental pulmonary emboli, and thus,
the patient had to be started on Coumadin with Heparinization
initially.

She had been maintaining O2 saturations in the mid 90's on
room air, but became more dyspneic on that day.  A chest
x-ray also revealed some retrocardiac consolidation and
collapse in the left lower lobe.  She was given a course of
levofloxacin to treat for a pneumonia.  She remained well.
She continued to do better after admission to the Intensive
Care Unit after Heparin was started.  The patient was also
treated for pneumonia empirically with the course of
levofloxacin.

Her atrial fibrillation did continue to be a problem, but was
not felt to be the source of her respiratory distress.  She
was placed on increasing doses of metoprolol and diltiazem
until she was on 100 mg po tid of metoprolol and 120 mg po
qid of diltiazem.  Because of maximal A-V nodal blockade and
still with persistent rapid ventricular rates, Cardiology was
called, and they recommended no further pharmacological
therapy if the patient remained asymptomatic from her atrial
fibrillation.

The patient did not experience any symptoms with her
tachycardia, and it was felt that conservative management
should be pursued at the recommendation of Cardiology.  If
she were to continue to have symptomatic tachycardic atrial
fibrillation, she would be a candidate for A-V junction
ablation with a pacemaker.  Her cardiologist, is Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 49291**], was [**Name (NI) 653**], and he agreed with the plan.

3. Anticoagulation:  The patient was kept on Heparin and
started on Coumadin at 5 mg a day.  On [**7-13**], her INR is
3.8.  She will be held off her Coumadin this evening and to
resume a dose of 4 mg po q day starting tomorrow.  She should
have her INR checked between and kept at a goal between 2 and
3.  She should probably maintain Coumadin for six months for
her first episode of pulmonary embolism.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Left parietal hemorrhage secondary to trauma with some
bilateral intraventricular bleed.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
3. Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli treated with
Coumadin.
4. Ruled out for cervical fracture status post trauma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
2. Warfarin 4 mg po q day.
3. Metoprolol 100 mg po tid.
4. Diltiazem 120 mg po qid.
5. Docusate 100 mg po bid.
6. Multivitamins one cap po q day.
7. Pantoprazole 40 mg po q day.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to followup with a MRI in
approximately four weeks' time.  The patient should have a
MRI in four weeks' time to evaluate whether there is a
primary reason for the bleed such as tumor underlying the
bleed.  Initial MRI scan on [**7-11**] demonstrated subacute
blood that obscured the region of the left parietal cortex
making it difficult to assess whether there is any other
structural abnormality underlying the cause of the bleed.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient should followup with her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] at [**Hospital6 1130**].
