Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%  >= 55%

Findings
40 mg of Propofol was given.
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.


RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: PFO is present.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal descending aorta diameter. No atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No masses or
vegetations on aortic valve. No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No mass or
vegetation on mitral valve. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.


PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Stretched
patent foramen ovale is present.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted 2 days prior to surgery for heparinization off
coumadin. She was taken to the operating room  on [**11-27**] where
bilateral thoracoscopic mini-Mazes with left atrial appendage
ligation was performed.  She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.

She weaned from the ventilator and was extubated on POD 2 after
her metabolic acidosis/respiratory failure cleared.  A TEE was
performed on POD 1 to demonstrate no cardiac pathology.
Paravertebral blocks were administered on [**11-28**] for pain control
with good results.  She was kept in the ICU for pulmonary care
and ready for transfer to the floor on POD 5 ([**12-2**]). Amiodarone,
beta blockers and antiinflammatory medications were administered
to maintain sinus rhythm and control post operative inflammatory
response. However on POD# 6 pt developed Afib, flutter which was
rate controlled. Coumadin was resumed at home dose of 5 mg but
INR rose to 5.6- coumadin was held and d/c was post-poned.  That
evening she went into atrial flutter and her lopressor was
increased.  On post-operative day 9 she was electively
cardioverted to sinus rhythm. INR normalized and the patient was
maintained on lower doses of coumadin than previously due to
concommitant amiodarone administration.
She continued to progress and she was ready for discharge to
rehab on POD # 12 where she will undergo further conditioning to
increase strength, endurance and activities of daily living. All
follow up appointments were advised.
