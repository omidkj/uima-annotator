History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 41766**] is a 36 yo M who was transferred from an OSH
after
a MCV. Per EMS report, he was unrestrained and found
self-ejected
from the car. He was noted to have + EtOH with slurred speech at
the scene. He was placed in a C-Collar and taken to an OSH where
he was found to have a C7 fracture. He was given Narcan for
drowsiness which improved his mental status. Later in his course
at the ED he was given Ativan 1mg x 2 and then 4 mg of morphine.
He was transferred here for further evaluation.

In our ED, he was very drowsy and was given Narcan again with
good results. Afterwards, however he stated that he was very
anxious and had pain "all over". He requested Dilaudid as
morphine makes him too sleepy.

Mr. [**Known lastname 41766**] states that he has been in detox for alcohol for the
last 4 days and decided to leave today, prior to discharge
because "I was going crazy". He states that he typically drinks
about 6 beers or 2 "40's" per night as well as a "pint". He is
uncertain of how much he drank this evening. He denies having
taken other drugs tonite but states that he has used heroin in
the past. In the ED, the patient was found to have a small blue
bag with a white power in it. The patient states he is not sure
what is in it, "I don't remember".
