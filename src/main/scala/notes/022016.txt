Imaging
[**2123-2-27**] TT Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The left ventricle
appears to be underfilled. The right ventricular cavity is
probably mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2123-2-27**] CXR
ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric feeding tube passes
into a
distended stomach and out of view. Large area of new right
perihilar
consolidation could be pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage but in
the presence of a mild degree of left perihilar opacification
could be a markedly asymmetric pulmonary edema. Heart size
normal. No pneumothorax.

[**2123-2-21**] TEE
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-12-23**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure are higher. The right ventricular
cavity is now dilated with mild free wall hypokinesis. Global
left ventricular systolic function remains

[**2123-2-19**] EKG
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 89. RSR' pattern with QRS duration
of 82 milliseconds. Decreased precordial voltage in leads V4-V6
with flat T waves in leads II, III, aVF and V3-V6. Compared to
the
previous tracing of [**2123-2-19**] there is no diagnostic interim
change.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient present to [**Hospital1 **]
[**2123-2-18**] for surgical repair colonic stricture.  She was
identified in the pre-operative area where her history, physical
and consent was reviewed.  She was given intravenous
antibiotics, subcutaneous heparin and taken to the operating
room in the appropriate fasion.  Please see operative report for
details.  Of note, 3400 mL of crystalloid, albumin 250 mL was
administered during the operation, the patient made 130 mL of
urine output an there was an estimated blood [**Last Name (un) 940**] of 400 mL.
The patient was initially extubated in the OR and transferred to
the PACU.  While in the PACU she required pressors
post-operatively and was sent to the surgical intensive care
unit for recovery for acute respiratory faluire and hypotension.
 Her hospital course in the SICU on day of transfer to the floor
can be summarized by the following review of systems:

Neurologic: Dilantin 100q8 for seixure prophylaxis, Morphine for
pain on day of transfer to the floor [**2123-2-25**] she was following
commands with intermittent confusion/delenrium.
Cardiovascular: Diuresisng with lasix; goal of 1L negative, on
metoproloed 25 [**Hospital1 **].
Pulmonary: Sating 90's on NC, on albuterl/Atrovent nebs and
recieving chest PT
GI: NGT in place with tubefeeds at goal on a bowel regimen.
Consults: Speech and swallow recommended NPO until mental status
improves.
Renal: Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **]
Hematoloty: HCT of 36.7%, Endocrine: RISS; ID: afebrile WBC
decreasing, off antibiotics.
Wound: midline
Prophylaxis: SQH, Boots and proton pump inhibitor FID
Full Code status requiring proxy consent.

The patient was transferred to the floor the in the evening on
[**2123-2-25**] and remained stable on [**2123-2-26**].  she was monitored on
telemetery for tachycardia, her blood labs were monitored and
electrolytes appropriately replaced.

[**2123-2-27**]
Patient was seen by the surgery team on am rounds and was in
stable conditon.  At approximately 10:10am the patient was coded
for PEA arrest after an episode of emesis.  She underwent
prolonged CPR requiring femoral line and endotracheal tube
placement. She appropriately recieved epinephrine, atropine,
several liters of fluid for low BP and 2 unites of PRBCs.  She
was started on Norepinephrine and vasopressin for BP support and
was tranferred to the MICU intubated on AC 100%/24x300/+10
settings.  A TTE and CXR was performed and workup initiated.
The patient's family was allowed to visit the patient at 1:15pm
whereby [**Name8 (MD) **] MD informed them of the patient's grave prognosis.
At 1:23pm her heart rate was seen to brady down and PEA arrest
followed.  CPR was immediately initiated.  The patient remained
unresponsive and CPR was stopped ending the code per the SICU
Attending who pronounced the patient as deceased. The Family was
again allowed to see the patient and elected to have a post
mortum.  All necesssary paperwork was completed and the patient
belonging were taken home
