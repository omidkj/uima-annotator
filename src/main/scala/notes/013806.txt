Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
53 year old gentleman with a history of melanoma and asthma
presented to OSH ED on [**2170-2-8**] with complaint of seven days of
dyspnea.  Had initially seen PCP with this complaint one week
ago.  Described feeling short of breath with exertion.  Believed
he was having pneumonia which he has had twice before.  No
fevers or chillls, only a mild non-productive cough.  At PCP
office, x-ray and laboratories were normal.  He tried taking his
albuterol inhaler more often and, though this resulted in some
relief, his symptoms worsened.  He returned to PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 76262**]
this time he could only walk a couple steps before feeling
dyspneic.  At the office an EKG revealed inverted T waves.  He
was then taken by ambulance to [**Hospital6 33**] ED.
Reportedly hemodynamically stable on presentation.  A D-dimer
was elevated.   A CT torso was performed and revealed saddle
embolus and multiple segmental PE.  Aspirin, plavix were given
along with a heparin bolus of 5,000 units and drip at 1000 units
an hour.   CK, CK-MB and troponin T normal.

Patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where, in ED, HR's
80  BP 117/86 O2 96 on 2L.  PTT 52.2 on presentation Heparin
re-bolused and dose adjusted to 1500 units/hour.  Pt
subsequently admitted to MICU.
Currently, patient is without complaints.  He does say he feels
he will get dyspneic if he tries to move.

On review of systems, the patient denies chest pain.  He says he
gets lower leg cramps intermittently over several years.  No
recent travel or prolonged period of immobilization.  No trauma.
 No weight loss or anorexia recently.

Past Medical History:
1) Melanoma.  S/p excision of melanoma on L arm.
2) Multiple food allergies--result in anaphylactic reaction.  Pt
carries epi-pen.
3) Asthma, uses albuterol occasionally
4) Esophageal stricture, has undergone dilatation twice, most
recently in 3/[**2169**].
5) Status post excision of colon polyps.  Reportedly not
malignant
6) Family hx of clotting disorders

Social History:
Married, three grown children.  Works as warehouse manager.  No
history of tobacco use.  Occasional alcohol use on social
occasions.

Family History:
Parents with no known medical conditions.  On maternal side,
multiple relatives with malignancies including melanoma, lung
cancer, colon cancer, ovarian and breast cancer.
Pt recently learned (during hospitalization) that he has a
family history of clotting disorders with at least 3 relatives
with medically recognized clot. Of note, he had an uncle who
passed away from a pulmonary embolism.

Physical Exam:

Pertinent Results:
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2170-2-9**] 4:24 PM: Partially occlusive
thrombus within the left popliteal vein which does not appear to
extend proximally into the superficial femoral vein.
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-2-9**]
no significant change in previously noted inferior and anterior
T wave abnormalities and lateral ST-T wave changes. Clinical
correlation is suggested.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. There is no mass/thrombus in the
right ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction and signs of acute pulmonary hypertension. Preserved
left ventricular size and systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: 53 year old gentleman with a history of
melanoma and asthma presents with dyspnea on exertion and is
found to have pulmonary saddle embolus. Hemodynamically stable,
mild hypoxia. Transferred from OSH for further management.
.
1) Pulmonary embolic disease. The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital 18**] medical ICU after CT Chest at OSH showed a saddle embolus
and multiple segmental PEs. He was hemodynamically stable on
admission (and throughout his hospital course) and was placed on
a heparin drip. Cardiac enzymes were trended and found to be
normal. He had an echocardiogram which showed signs of right
heart strain, consistent with his diagnosis of PE. He received
supplemental oxygen. After a short period of observation in the
ICU, he was transferred to the medicine floor. At that time he
had significant improvement in his dyspnea and after 2 days no
longer required supplemental oxygen and was able to ambulate the
corridors while maintaining on O2 sat of >90% on room air. He
was started on warfarin on [**2-10**] and received two days of 10mg,
then one day of 5mg. On [**2-13**] his INR was 4.9 and his dose was
held. After a total of 5 days of IV heparin and an overlap of at
least 48 hours of a therapeutic INR, his heparin drip was
discontinued on [**2-14**] and he was discharged with instructions to
take 5mg Coumadin on the day of discharge. He was established
with the [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **] and will get his INR checks
in [**Location (un) 3320**] at [**Hospital3 3583**] which is closer to home.
Of note, while he was in the hospital he learned that he had
multiple family members in [**Name (NI) 4754**] with medical history of
clotting disorders and in particular had an uncle who passed
away from a pulmonary embolism. As a result of this he would
benefit from a hereditary coagulopathy workup as an outpatient.
.
2) Food allergies. Pt reports fairly recent hx of new food
allergies resulting in anaphylaxis. An EpiPen was maintained at
bedside, but the patient did not have any allergic reactions
during his hospitalization. He reports that he has 3 EpiPens at
home and carries one with him at all times.
.
3) History of melanoma. The patient reports having a small
melanoma excised 2 years ago, would benefit from outpatient
follow-up.
