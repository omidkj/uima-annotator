Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Fluoxetine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Large R PICA stroke.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Suboccipital craniotomy
tracheostomy
PEG tube placement
Placement and removal of central line


History of Present Illness:
83F h/o DM, CAD p/w n/v & lethargy, found to have large R
PICA stroke at [**Hospital 6138**] Hospital. USOH until today when she
complained of nausea and vomiting, with generalized weakness.
She
presented to OSH and CT showed R PICA stroke. She became
increasingly lethargic and was intubated for airway protection.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
83 yo f with PMH positive for CAD, strokes, NIDDM, Asthma
presented to OSH with lethargy and cc of weakness, n/v on
[**2153-8-21**]. Was found to have right cerebellar stroke and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. At [**Hospital1 **] ED she was intubated for airway
protection due to increased lethargy and put on neosynephrine
drip due to hypotension.
Review of Head CT showed large right PICA cerebellar infarct
with midline shift and pressure on the 4th ventricle. She has
chronic left MCA stroke, left PCA stroke, and right MCA stroke.
She was given Mannitol 50grams iv once. Patient was
hyperventilated. Neurosurgery performed suboccipital craniotomy
to relieve intracranial pressure.

Physical Exam:
O: T: afeb BP: 72/20 on Levophed  HR: 77   R: 22   O2Sat
Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT
Lungs: CTA bilaterally.
Cardiac: RRR. S1/S2.

Neuro:
Mental status: Unresponsive to voice, grimaces to painful
stimuli. Follows no commands.

Cranial Nerves: Has positive gag, corneal, and oculocephalic
reflexes.

Motor: Normal bulk and tone bilaterally. No abnormal movements,
tremors. Purposeful movements antigravity of bilateral UE,
withdrawal of right LE, no movement of Left LE.

Sensation: NT.

Toes up on left, down on right


Pertinent Results:
CT from OSH (images reviewed): Large R cerebellar infarct with
some mass effect on midline of cerebellum, enlarged 3rd
ventricle, mass effect on 4th ventricle but not fully
compressed.
No hemorrhage. Old L PCA infarct. Multiple small cortical
infarcts.

Non-contrast Head CT:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Hypodensity consistent with edema and infarction involving
most of the right and possible a small part of the left
cerebellar hemisphere, producing mass effect with almost
complete effacement of the fourth ventricle.
3. Hypodensity in the watershed zones bilaterally may represent
chronic infarcts.
4. Small hypodensities in the periventricular and deep white
matter, likely representing sequela of chronic microvascular
ischemia.
5. Osteoma arising from the right temporal bone.

MRI:
1. Acute right posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarct with
blood products. Post-surgical changes are seen in the region.
Chronic right and left cerebellar infarct.
2. Chronic cortical infarcts in the left frontoparietal region.
3. Severe changes of small vessel disease and moderate brain
atrophy.
4. Small incidental calcified meningioma right temporal region

Head CT [**8-23**]:
-new cerebellar bleed

Brief Hospital Course:
# Strokes/Mental Status: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with a large
cerebellar stroke with evidence of compression of her fourth
ventricle and hydrocephalus of the 3rd ventricle. She was given
a 6-pack of platelets (as she had been on aspirin and Plavix)
and was taken emergently from the ED to the OR by neurosurgery
where she underwent a suboccipital craniotomy for decompression.
She tolerated the procedure well and was admitted to the
NeuroICU following the procedure.  A TTE showed a large PFO with
an Atrial septal aneurysm therefore her mechanism was felt to be
likely thromboembolic.  LENI's were checked and were negative.
Mentation greatly improved during the patient's stay,
correlating with treatment of her pneumonia and tracheostomy
placement. At time of discharge from the ICU, she was much more
interactive.  The patient continued to be interactive when
examined with a translator.  She would follow basic commands,
such as moving her extremities and squeezing her hands.  She
would deny pain or discomfort.  She was re-started on coumadin
for anticoagulation for her thromboembolic stroke.  Her INR will
need to be monitored and coumidin increased with a INR goal of
[**12-22**].5.
.
# Respiratory Distress: Patient received tracheostomy on
[**2152-11-30**], and her chest x-ray has demonstrated much improvement,
only notable for persistent lll collapse.  Patient was treated
for ventilator associated pneumonia twice with courses
vancomycin and zosyn. Ultrasound was used to evaluate for
potential effusion for thoracentesis, but there was not enough
fluid to tap. Patient underwent several bronchoscopies with
removal of mucoid material.  Patient was unable to be weaned off
of the ventilator, and failed trials of extubation, aggressive
pulmonary toilet, and had repeated atelectatic collapse of of
lung.  Daily pressure support trials were initiated after
trachestomy, and she did well. Normal saline nebs were used to
hydrate the airway, and she was given inhaled corticosteroids
for her history of asthma/COPD. Gentle diuresis was attempted
but limited by hypotension.
Plans were made to transition the patient to pulmonary rehab.
Given her repeated collapse noted on chest x-ray and on repeat
bronchoscopies, patient may be candidate for stent placement
from interventional pulmonology in the future.  On the floor,
the patient was saturating well on her trach mask.  In the
future, she should be weaned down as she tolerates.  A few days
before discharge, she had a sputum sample taken that grew
pan-sensitive klebsiela.  However, she remained afebile and her
WBC was not increased.  And chest xray did not suggest a
pneumonia.  If her clinical condition were to change, would
consider covering klebsiela with antibiotics.
.
# Clonus: Patient was noted to have a new finding of bilateral
cloni of the feet on exam, and mild serotonin syndrome was
suspected. Neurology, who was involved throughout the patient's
stay, felt this was more likely residual from prior stroke. As a
result, fluoxetine was discontinued, and fentanyl IV was weaned
and transitionned to a patch. A repeat head CT shows no new
bleeding or lesions, but increased size of pseudomeningocele.
.
# Fever: Patient continued to have low grade fevers and
leukopenia, however no systemic signs of infection were noted,
and cultures remained negative. It was suspected that her was
possibly due to suspected serotonin syndrome.  At the time of
discharge she was afebile and her WBC was stable.  If her
clinical picture should change, as noted above in respiratory
section, she should be covered for the klebsiela found in her
sputum.  At the time of discharge there was not clinical
indication to start treatment.
.
# Blood pressure: Patient had highly variable blood pressure
while in the intensive care unit. She was initially
hypertensive, and then became hypotensive, which was typically
responsive to fluids. At time of discharge from the MICU, she
was normotensive, and her home blood pressure medications were
held.  Her lisinopril was restarted at a low dose of 2.5mg and
her blood pressures were stable at the time of discharge.  He
blood pressure should be monitored and medications titrated as
needed to maintain good blood pressure control.
.
#Metabolic Alkalosis:  Patient noted to have small metabolic
alkalosis, pH 7.44 HCO3 36 at the time of discharge.  It was
stable.
.
# Anemia: Hct 28-32 during this admission, and was stable in
mid-20s during ICU stay. Iron studies consistent with anemia of
chronic disease.
.
# CAD: Stable.  ASA, Plavix and BB were held, ACEI was restarted
at low dose.  Stati
