Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
DTs, Intubated. Transfer from outside hospital.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation
2. Tracheostomy
3. Video swallow study
4. Numerous temporary central venous catheters
5. EGD


History of Present Illness:
38 yo M h/o asthma, HTN, macrocytic anemia, erosive gastritis
admitted to OSH w/pancreatitis. Pt had and EGD 6 days prior to
initial admission due to "blood in stools" which found errosive
gastritis. He had been taking Immodium due to diarrhea, he
denied any hematemesis, melena or hematochezia. His wife denied
any h/o DTs, or hospitalizations for ETOH abuse/withdrawal,
seizure or pancreatitis. He presented to OSH on [**2109-5-29**] for
epigastric pain, N/V x2 days. Initial Lipase 3223, amylase 314
and Abd CTO c/w severe pancreatitis w/o any evidence of
pancreatic necrosis or abscess. He was agressively resuscitated
with IVF, pain control with dilaudid and kept NPO. On 1st night
of admission he was transferred to the ICU for increasing
agitation thought to be ETOH withdrawal, requiring high doses of
benzos, in which he was eventually started on an ativan drip. On
[**6-1**] he developed a fever 102.5 and started on imepenem. His HCT
also dropped from 26.5 to 23% and transfused PRBC.
.
On [**6-2**] his agitation increased and his ativan was increased,
placed in 4 point restraints due to severe agitation, he
developed acure respiratory distress concerning for pulm edema
in the setting IVF and PRBC transfusions (unclear number of IVF
and PRBC transfusions). Diuresis was initiated. Psychiatry also
evaluated the pt whom recommended ativan gtt + haldol 10mg q6hr
+ haldol prn for presumed DTs.
On [**6-3**] his restraints were removed, started a clear diet,
resumed his lisinopril for HTN, and imepenem d/c'd due to
negative cultures and CXR.
On [**6-4**] his haldol dose was increased, he was maintained on a
higher dose of ativan gtt, he had an acute episode of hypoxia at
10pm-acute respiratory distress and intubated. CTA was negative
for PE, no evidence of PNA.
On [**6-5**] he had another fever to 103, tachycardic, haldol use,
elevated CK 3800- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome was considered.
The pt was put back on ativan gtt at an increased dose to
20mg/hr and fentanyl gtt prior to transfer. Per family request
he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.


Past Medical History:
-Extensive ETOH abuse, drinks 1.5 pints Vodka per day may be 3
pints since the age of 18, no prior h/o DTs or ETOH withdrawal,
but admits to black outs and tremors.
-Erosive gastritis
-Asthma
-GERD/PUD
-HTN
-chronic diarrhea
-macrocytic anemia
-s/p MVA [**2095**] with R leg/foot skin grafts
-anxiety/agitation
-h/o physical abuse


Social History:
-Married w/4 children, works in construction, +TOB 1ppmonth
-Extensive alcohol abuse as noted above, no h/o DTs or
hospitalizations for ETOH w/drawal or abuse
-per wife, denies any other form of drug abuse


Family History:
Unable to obtain due to intubation

Physical Exam:
On arrival to MICU:
GEN: Intubated, sedated
HEENT: ETT in place, PERRL
RESP: CTABL anteriorly, diminished BS at bases b/l
CV: Reg Nml S1, S2, no M/R/G
ABD: Soft, ND, NT diminished BS
EXT: No peripheral edema, warm, 1+ DP pulses
NEURO: Sedated


Pertinent Results:
-CXR
The tip of the endotracheal tube is 7 cm above the carina.
There is a feeding tube whose distal tip is beyond the
gastroesophageal junction.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  There
is low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vascular
markings at the lung bases. There is a left retrocardiac opacity
and blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles suggestive of
small pleural effusions.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
.
OSH IMAGING:
-[**5-30**] Abd U/S
Mild hepatosplenomegaly. The liver shows increased echogenicity
suggesting fatty infiltration, spleen enlarged at 15.7 cm,
kidneys are normal in size
-[**5-30**] Abd CT
CT findings compatible with severe pancreatitis. The pancreas is
diffusely enlarged and has extensive high-attenuation stranding
and surounding fluid. No loculated drainable fluid collection is
identified.
.
CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary embolus within the distal right main pulmonary
artery extending into the proximal upper and lower lobe
branches. Questionable filling defects within the left lower
lobe branches may be breathing/mixing artifact.

2. Mild amount of retained secretions within the distal trachea
and proximal main stem bronchi.

3. Splenomegaly and mild peripancreatic mesenteric stranding
consistent with known history of pancreatitis.
.
CT SINUS:
IMPRESSION: Sinus thickening in multiple paranasal sinuses with
features as described above. No air fluid levels
.
CTA ABDOMEN [**6-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Resolving pancreatitis with mild fat stranding suggestive of
inflammation. No evidence of pancreatic necrosis. Fluid tracking
from the head of the pancreas and extending along the right
anterior pararenal and paracolic spaces has decreased since
prior examination. No organized fluid collections or abscesses.
2. Splenomegaly is unchanged since prior examination.
.
TEE:
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No valvular vegetations or paravalvar abcesses
seen.
IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of endocarditis.
