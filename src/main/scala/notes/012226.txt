Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHEST PAIN:

The patient was admitted to medicine and placed on heparin for
concern of both MI and PE.  Her lasix was held as she appeared
clinically dry.  The patient ruled out for MI by serial cardiac
ensymes.  VQ was obtained the morning after admission and was
low probability.  The patient's hematocrit as <29, so 1 unit of
blood was transfused.  Echocardiography was obtained
demonstrating:

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Color Dopper is suggestive of
the presence of a left to right shunt across the interatrial
septum consistent with a probable atrial septal defect. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include anteroseptal, apical and inferolateral
hypokinesis. Views are technically suboptimal for assessment of
regional wall motion. Estimated ejection fraction ?35-40%? No
apical thrombus identified but cannot exclude. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2150-9-7**], tricuspid regurgitation is now more
prominent.

The patient had an p-MIBI done on [**12-16**] which showed:
No anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG. Atrial
irritability as noted. Severe, fixed defects of the lateral and
inferolateral walls,
unchanged from the prior study. There is diffuse hypokinesis
with a calculated
left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%.

Given the abnormal p-MIBI, the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization [**12-17**].
The catheterization revealed a right dominant system with 1 VD -
a complex 60% stenosis involving the bifurcation of the proximal
LAD and D1 branch. The LMCA and RCA had mild luminal
irregularities, without flow limiting stenoses.  Resting
hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated left and right
sided filling pressures. PA systolic pressure was markedly
elevated at 75 mmHg. Mean PCWP was elevated at 35 mmHg. Left
sided filling pressures were markedly elevated with LVEDP 30
mmHg. Central hypertension was noted with blood pressure 214/80
mmHg. Cardiac index was preserved at 2.3 L/min/m2 by Fick. After
administration of nitroprusside IV systolic blood pressure fell
to 120/60 mmHg and PA systolic pressures fell to 40 mmHg with a
mean PCWP 12 mmHg.  Her swan was discontinued in the PACU, and
the patient was transferred to the CCU for one night
post-catheterization for closer blood pressure monitoring on her
nitroprusside drip.

ICU stay:

In the ICU she was started on Imdur 90 mg daily, and her
Trandolapril was increased to 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] rather than daily.  She
was continued on Metoprolol 75 mg [**Hospital1 **] with good rate control.
On this regimen, the nitroprusside was able to be weaned off
within the first 4 hours of arrival to the CCU, with systolic
pressures maintained between 100 and 120 mmHg.  She was given
lasix 20 mg x 1 on the evening of arrival in the CCU, as well as
being started on 40 mg PO daily the next morning secondary to
rales on physical exam and the history of elevated filling
pressures during catheterization.

She was able to be transferred back to the floors after 1 night
in the CCU.

On the general cardiac medical floor, the patient continued to
be monitored on telemetry with no events. She continued to
diurese and her weight was decreased to 77.9 kg from 80.7 kg on
admit. Her blood pressure remained stable between systolic blood
pressure of 120 to 155. Her Imdur was titrated up to 120 mg po
daily for improved control. With improved blood pressure
control, the patient experienced no further chest pain.

2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:
AS states above, in cath patient was felt to be volume
overloaded with elevated left sided filling pressures and rales
on exam. She was actively diuresed and dry weight on discharge
was 77.9 kg.  She had trace LE edema on discharge and appeared
euvolemic. Patient was discharged on 40 mg po Lasix. She will
likely need to decrease back to 20 mg po Lasix daily after
several more days on increased dose.

3. MYALGIAS:
Her prednisone taper was continued for her myalgias of unclear
etiology.  She is due to follow up with Rheumatology for further
work-up.

4. ANEMIA:
Patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia. Her hematocrit
was noted to trend down during hospital stay and stabilized
around 30. There was no evidence of active bleeding. stools were
reportedly guiac negative.  Patient will have follow up CBC
checked by PCP.

5. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:
Patient had elevated 1.6 on discharge, which was near baseline
1.4 to 1.5. Her creatinine should be rechecked at outpatient
follow up with PCP and Lasix decreased if creatinine rising.

6. DEPRESSION:
Celexa was continued for depression.

7. Prophylaxis:
PPI was continued. Pt was continued on docusate and senna for
bowel regimen.

8. Code:
The patient was full code throughout her stay.

9. DISPOSITION:
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy who felt patient
was safe for discharge home with home safety evaluation on
[**2150-12-19**]. The patient will need to call and schedule
follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5263**] on Monday [**2150-12-21**] to have
BP check, CBC, creatinine, BUN, and potassium checked. Her Lasix
dose may need to be decreased back to 20 mg po daily.
