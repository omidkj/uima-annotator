History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 15308**] is a 71 year old woman with past history of HTN,
atrial fibrillation (on flecainide, not anticoagulated due
history of falls), GERD, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, asthma
who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] at 0300 on [**6-8**] with chest pain.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 15308**] stated that she has been feeling unwell for
approximately 3 days with symptoms of UTI and intermittant chest
pressure, but maintained her daily activities.  On night prior
to admission, she noted worsening in her dysuria and some
hematuria.  At about 0130 in the morning on [**6-8**], she developed
worsening substernal chest pain, non-radiating, approx [**2191-6-16**]
associated with SOB.  SOB was not similar to previous asthma
episodes and was not responsive to albuterol inhaler.  Denies
palpitations, N/V at that time, numbness or syncope.  She went
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where she was found to have ST elevation in V2
with lateral ST depressions.  She was given aspirin, not plavix
loaded, and SL NTG x 1 with resolution in her pain and ST
changes.  Initial CK was 28 and Troponin T < 0.01.  She also had
a UA and was given Levoquin 750 mg x 1 for treatment of UTI.
She was admitted to the ICU for further management.  CK and
Troponins were trended CK 28 (ED) --> 35 --> 35; Troponin <.01
--> 0.195* --> 0.151.  She had worsening chest pain at this time
with episode of nausea and emesis.  She was started on a heparin
gtt, given SL nitro with little improvement in pain and started
on nitro gtt with resolution of pain to [**2-20**].  Metoprolol
started.  Cipro was started for her UTI.  She is transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for possible cardiac cath.
.
On further discussion with patient, she states that she has had
intermittant bilateral lower extremity edema and worsening SOB
over the past months.  She was recently prescribed Lasix 20 mg
qweekly prn for her peripheral edema.  She also has recently
started sleeping on 3 pillows (from 2).  Denies palpitations or
syncope.  Shortness of breath is different from her asthma, but
is able to walk multiple laps around her retirement community
and sustain 30 minutes of light activity without chest pain.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2191-6-9**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal
akinesis and thinning, and mid to distal apical/inferior/lateral
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2185-6-17**], the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is
new.

Brief Hospital Course:
71F with hsitory of HTN, Afib on flecainide, dyslipidemia,
asthma and hypothyroidism presented to OSH with chest pain,
found to have EKG changes with ST elevation and positive cardiac
enzymes, now chest pain free on Nitro gtt; transferred for
possible cardiac cath.

# NSTEMI - Mrs. [**Known lastname 15308**] was transferred from OSH for possible
cardiac cateterization after presenting with chest pain,
determined to have NSTEMI.  She was transferred on heparin gtt
and nitro gtt, which were continued on admission.  Her
flecainide was initially continued, but then discontinued in
setting of ACS; she was started on metoprolol for rate control.
She was chest pain free on the nitro gtt and this was
discontinued on hospital day 1 due to hypotension.  She remained
chest pain free after discontinuation of nitroglycerin.  She was
loaded with plavix, started ASA, and continued on her statin.
Repeat echo showed septal akinesis and mid-to-distal
apical/inferior/lateral hypokinesis as reported from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
 After discussions with patient, she decided to undergo cardiac
catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization showed a re
