History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe
peripheral [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG
and atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presents to the
emergency room after two falls at home. The first fall occurred
on [**2174-11-3**] at home when he fell in his kitchen. He hit is right
shoulder and presented to the emergency room where he had a
right clavicle xray which showed no fracture of dislocation and
was discharged home with pain medications. The patient has very
limited mobility at baseline and uses a wheelchair. He requires
the use of his arms to help get out of bed and into his
wheelchair and also for balance. He has had significant pain his
his right arm since his fall and this has made getting around
his house increasingly difficult. On [**2174-11-4**] he was trying to
take a shower and had a plastic bag on his right foot to protect
his foot ulcers. He tried to get out of the shower and he
slipped on the plastic bag and fell on his right hip. Because
his arm was hurt as well he was unable to get himself back to a
seated position and lay on the ground for an hour before a
friend found him and called 911. EMS came to his home but he did
not want to come back to the hospital so they placed him in his
bed. He reports that they placed him facing in the wrong
position and he was unable to get out of bed or reach his pills
so he has not been taking his pills now for 48 hours. He was so
disabled that he ultimately called EMS again so that he could be
brought to the emergency room.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99 P: 108 BP: 131/81 R: 16 O2 sat
99% on RA. He had a CXR which showed mild [**Date Range 1106**] prominence
but no focal infiltrates. He had an xray of his right hip which
was negative for fracture and a non-contrast head CT which
showed no evidence of hemorrhage. Patient was given one liter of
normal saline, zofran 4 mg IV x 1 and vancomycin 1000 mg IV x 1
out of concern for possible right shoulder cellulitis. He is
admitted to the floor for further management.
.
On the floor he continues to have significant right shoulder
pain. He has mild right hip pain but is able to move his right
leg. He denies fevers, chills, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest
pain or shortness of breath. He did have nausea earlier in the
day but this has resolved. He denies abdominal pain,
constipation, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, dysuria or
hematuria. He has minimal sensation in his feet bilaterally but
denies foot pain. All other review of systems is negative in
detail.

      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH OF TWO COLONIAL
MORPHOLOGIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
      CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES (DIPHTHEROIDS).    MODERATE
