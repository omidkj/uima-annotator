Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Ultracet / Codeine / Flagyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, Chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography

History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 84M with stage two metastastic pancreatic cancer
with palliative CBD stent placement who presents with fevers and
chills for 1 day. He does not endorse feeling particularly short
of breath although he admits now that he feels better with
oxygen. He measured his temperature at home to be ~100.6. He
also notes continued abdominal bloating that he has had for
months, although he feels it is actually slightly better now. He
does not have any focal abdominal tenderness. He states he had
dysuria about 1-2 weeks ago but this stopped a few days ago.
.
In the ED CXR showed a right-sided PNA. His UA was floridly
positive. After discussion with the ID fellow, he was treated
with Levo and clinda due to allergies to PCN and Flagyl. His SBP
was mostly in the 120s initially. His LFTs were found to be
markedly abnormal, and he was sent for RUQ US that showed air in
the gallbladder, indicating patency of the CBD stent; sludge and
stones in the GB; and thickening of the CBD wall that may
represent infiltration of tumor. Upon return from US, his SBP
dropped to the high 70s but responded to the 90s-100s with an
additional 1L of IVF. He received a total of ~2L IVF in the ED.
He was admitted to the MICU for further fluids and monitoring.

Past Medical History:
Past Onc Hx: He was Diagnosed with pancreatic ca in [**7-27**] after
an episode of cholangitis and sepsis. He had ERCP w/ stenting
and PTC placed. He is s/p biliary stent ([**10-27**]). His disease was
felt to be unresectable due to the confluence of the splenic
vein and lack of fat planes for resection. He was treated w/
palliative, weekly Gemcitabine x 3 from [**2153-11-27**] to [**2153-12-11**]. His
postchemo course was c/b prolonged periods of neutropenia fevers
and infections such as klebsiella bacteremia. He underwent
cyberknife therapy in [**3-28**]. PET [**1-29**] was notable for a FDG-avid
infiltrating mass originating in pancreatic head that extends to
porta hepatitis and which abuts, but does not appear to extend
beyond, the site of fiducial markers. No evidence of remote
FDG-avid metastatic disease. Ca19-9 on [**2154-2-8**] - 126 from 11 in
[**8-28**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2155-4-6**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US:
1. Air in the biliary system indicating patency of the common
bile duct stent.  2. Sludge and stones in the gallbladder, with
focus of air in the gallbladder also suggesting patency with the
biliary system.  3. Unchanged appearance since [**2155-3-14**] CT
scan of thickening of the common bile duct, which itself is
normal caliber.
.
[**2155-4-6**] CXR: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
[**2155-4-6**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead voltage. Delayed
precordial R wave progression. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2153-7-28**] the rate has slowed and there is variation in
precordial lead placement. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim
change.
.
[**2155-4-8**] CXR: Compared with 4/16, the CHF/fluid overload has
almost completely cleared.
.
[**2155-4-9**] CXR: No evidence of lung consolidation.
.
[**2155-4-12**] ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT): Non-specific bowel gas pattern
which includes dilated loops of small bowel. However air and
stool are seen in the colon. If there is persistent pain,
followup radiographs or cross-sectional imaging is recommended.
.
[**2155-4-15**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions with no evidence
of pulmonary edema.
.
[**2155-4-15**] ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT): Mildly distended gas-filled
loops of large bowel with multiple air-fluid levels, which
likely represents ileus. the appearance is improved when
compared to the prior study.
.
[**2155-4-8**] ERCP: A metal stent was found in the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome through the metal stent seen in good position at
the ampulla. Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification. Filling defects in the stent within the CBD were
noted. The intrahepatic ducts were normal.Biliary debris and
purulent bile was extracted successfully using sweeps with a
balloon catheter. The stent allowed passage of a fully inflated
12mm balloon.
Occlusion cholangiogram performed at the end of the procedure
revealed no overgrowth or ingrowth of tumor into the stent.
