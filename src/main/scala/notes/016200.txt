History of Present Illness:
69 yo with a history of afib on anticoagulation,
hypertension, and CHF who awoke this morning with left sided
weakness.  He was last seen normal at 11:30PM the day prior when
he was in the living room watching TV and his wife had gone to
bed. She thinks that he likely went upstairs to go to bed at
midnight. This morning around 7:50AM, his right arm hit her and
she woke up.  She went to him and noticed that his right arm and
leg were flailing.  He was mumbling, "[**Last Name (un) **] pee" several times,
then said "too late" and became incontinent.  She noticed that
his left side wasn't moving, he had a right facial droop, and
that his speech was slurred.

She called 911 and EMS transported him to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.  En
route, he declined and became unresponsive.  Initial blood
pressure was 205/114.  At [**Hospital1 1474**], he was given Esmolol and
?Dilantin (on nursing chart, but no time or dose noted).  He was
given Lidocaine, Vecuronium, Succ, Etomidate, Ativan 2mg and
intubated.  He was then also given Vitamin K 10mg.  Notable labs
include an INR of 3.5.  A head CT was done, which showed a right
temporal parietal lobe hemorrhage with 17mm right to left shift
with subfalcine herniation.  The hemorrhage extends into the
lateral ventricles.  He had an EKG that showed he was in Afib
with a slow ventricular rate.  He was then transported to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care.

Since arrival, his systolic blood pressure has been in the 150s
to 160s.  Prior to the start of sedation, his pupils were
reportedly fixed and dilated.  He has been givein Vitamin K 10mg
(2nd dose), FFO x 2 units, Proplex x 4 vials, and started on
Propofol for sedation.

In review of systems, his wife states that two weeks ago, his
blood pressure was a little higher than usual 140-150/80-90.
One
week ago, he saw his sleep doctor and at the clinic visit, his
blood pressure was 155/95.  However, at home, his blood pressure
was 140/89.  His cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] who said to continue
to same medications until follow up with his regular doctor.  He
has not had any fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain.


Past Medical History:
Central sleep apnea on CPAP, CHF, HTN, diabetes, prostate
CA diagnosed in [**2164**] and treated with radiation which ended in
[**2166-3-6**], Afib on anticoagulation, basal cell CA at the right
ear and back.

NCHCT [**2167-1-14**]:
FINDINGS:  Since the prior study from approximately 3-1/2 hours
ago, there is
further increase in size of a right intraparenchymal hemorrhage
centered at
the right basal ganglia with now further extension into the
right thalamus and
possibly also involving the mid brain at the level of the
superior cerebellar
peduncle.  There is increase in shift of normally midline
structures with a
subfalcine herniation of approximately 1.7 cm.  Additionally,
there is
increased intraventricular extension with hemorrhage seen in the
lateral,
third, and fourth ventricles.  Enlargement of the contralateral
lateral
ventricle is seen, suggesting an increase in trapping and
obstruction of the
ventricular system. Hemorrhage is also seen within the
subarachnoid space,
which is new since prior study.

There is obliteration of the suprasellar and ambient cisterns
consistent with
uncal and downward transtentorial herniation. There is also
early
left tonsillar herniation.

These findings are most consistent with hypertension in the
setting of
anticoagulation.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Increased size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered at
the right basal
ganglia, with extension into the right thalamus, and possible
involvement of
the midbrain.
2.  Increased subfalcine herniation, with uncal, downward
transtentorial
and early tonsillar herniation.
3.  Marked increase in intraventricular hemorrhage with
increased trapping and
obstruction of the ventricular system.

CXR [**2167-1-14**]:
FINDINGS: Limited single bedside AP examination labeled
"semi-erect" and no
comparisons. The tip of the newly inserted ET tube lies some 3.7
cm proximal
to the carina, and the side-hole and tip of the endogastric tube
lie in the
gastric fundus, directed cephalad.  Allowing for the numerous
tubes and
monitoring electrodes overlying the upper thorax, other than
left basilar
subsegmental atelectasis, the lungs are clear.  The heart size
and pulmonary
vessels are likely within normal limits with no evident pleural
effusion (in
this position).  There are atherosclerotic changes involving the
thoracic
aorta.  Noted are gas-filled bowel loops in the left central
upper abdomen.

IMPRESSION:
1.  ET and NG tubes in satisfactory position.
2.  Left basilar atelectasis, with no other acute process.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neurologic ICU for further
observation and management.  Given the extent of the hemorrhage
and the patient's clinical state (only with Gag relex and some
extremity posturing to noxious), the neurologic team relayed the
patient's extremely poor prognosis to the family.  The patient
was screened for organ donation, and only deemed a candidate to
donate his corneas, which would be done post-mortem.  The family
decided to make the patient comfort measures only; he was thus
extubated on the evening of admission.  The patient died
comfortably in the evening.
