Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2198-12-6**]:
1. Mitral valve replacement with a 25/33-mm  On-X mechanical
valve, reference number [**Serial Number 101277**], serial number [**Serial Number 101278**]. 2.
Pericardial reconstruction with CorMatrix pericardial closure
device, reference number [**Serial Number 42232**], lot number [**Serial Number 101279**].


History of Present Illness:
64 year old female with a PMH of ESRD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy,
a-fib/flutter (on coumadin in the past, recently being held for
hx of septic emboli), MSSA
bacteremia/endocarditis in [**9-/2198**] and hypertension who was
brought in from dialysis with a chief complaint of chest
tightness x 1 hour and shortness of breath for 1 day. She felt
well begninning of last week. However, she started having
dyspnea over night when she was trying to go to bed and had to
sit up. Also states that she was having dry cough. Overnight,
she had some anxiety given her dypsnea. When she was at dialysis
in the morning, she noticed some chest pressure/tightness, which
was substernal, without radiation or frank pain. She had
palpitations during the episode, however they have now resolved.
She denies fever or chills. Per report she was hypotensive
during the session, though her BP improved with stopping
dialysis and her symptoms of tightness resolved. She has been at
rehab since her discharge from hospital for MSSA
bacteremia/endocarditis and for shortness of breath (during
which she was found to be in afib and her amiodarone was
restarted). She is known to cardiac surgery
and being evaluated for a mitral valve replacement.

alcohol, and denies illicit drug use. She used to work part-time
in a coffee shop, but currently does not work. She is Buddhist.

No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death. Her father died at the age of 80. Her
mother died at the age of 64 from lung CA. She has a sister with

Pertinent Results:
[**2198-12-6**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is
severe thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Posterior leaflet
motion is restricted due to heavy calcification. There is mild
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. Bilateral pleural
effusions are seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. Biventricular function is unchanged. No regional wall
motion abnormalities are seen. There is a well-seated,
well-functioning mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position.
No mitral regurgitation is seen. No paravalvular leak is seen.
Characteristic washing jets are present. There is a mean
gradient of 3 mmHg at a cardiac output of 4.3 L/min. Aortic
regurgitation is unchanged. Tricuspid regurgitation is
unchanged. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.

Final Report
EXAM: MRI of the brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with bihemispheric small infarcts,
likely due
to mitral valve vegetation, now status post MVR with change in
mental status.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial
images of the brain were acquired. 3D time-of-flight MRA of the
circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] obtained. 2D time-of-flight MRA of the head and neck was
obtained.

Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of
[**2198-11-13**].

FINDINGS:

BRAIN MRI:

There are several areas of restricted diffusion seen
predominantly in the deep
white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. In comparison to the
prior study
it demonstrates evolution of some of the previously seen
infarcts which are
now seen as T2 shine through. However, the other areas appear to
be
representing acute infarcts. Given the multiplicity as well as
the
involvement of both cerebral hemispheres and multiple vascular
territories
including the splenium of left
