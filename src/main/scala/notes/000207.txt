Brief Hospital Course:

# Pan-colitis: Differential included cryptosporidium, c.diff,
multiple bacterial/viral etiologies given CVID, and IBD. Broad
spectrum antibiotics were intiated on admission including PO/IV
vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl. The patient was started on IV
fluids; leukocytosis and lactate were trended in the ICU. CT
abdomen/pelvis showed diffuse severe pancolitis, small ileocolic
intussiception wihtout evidence of obstruction. The surgical
service was consulted but saw no acute indication for surgery
and followed the patient with serial abdominal exams. The
patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable in the ICU
and was subsequently tranferred to the regular medical floor.
The GI service was consulted and recommended a flexible
sigmoidoscopy, stool cultures and labs to evaluate the etiology
of her diarrhea. Thus far all stool labs for infectious causes
are negative. The biopsy upon flexible sigmoidoscopy showed mild
dysplasia and inflammation. It was recommended the patient
continue her PO flagyl for a 2 week course and follow up with GI
for a colonoscopy after discharge.

.
# Bacteremia: the patient was found to have S.pneumoniae on
blood culture while on vancomycin. The Infectious Disease
service was consulted. TTE and TEE were negative for
endocarditis. Ceftriaxone was initiated and PICC placed for IV
treatment for a 2 week course. The remainder of the blood
cultures are negative to date. The patient remained afebrile
during her admission. She has ID follow-up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] in
several weeks.

.
# Chronic Hepatitis C: LFTs were elevated above baseline on
admission. Initially cholestyramine, ursodiol and spironolactone
were held. Her LFTs were trended and slowly returned back to
baseline. After transfer to the medical service, given agressive
fluid resuscitation in the ICU, the patient was fluid overloaded
and required diuresis. Spironolactone was restarted and lasix
20mg po daily was added. An abdominal US showed a moderate
amount of ascites which was tapped via ultrasound guidance.
Approximately 500cc of fluid was removed, and labs were
consistant with SBP, althought the patient was asymptomatic and
already on ceftriaxone at that time. She will need follow-up for
her ascites as an outpatient to ensure it does not reaccumulate.
Her cholestyramine, ursodiol were restarted prior to discharge.
A follow-up appointment was scheduled with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 497**]
(hepatology).

.
# DM Type I: Patient reportedly hypoglycemic was hypoglycemic in
the ICU, glargine was discontinued while the patient was NPO.
Once her diet was advanced her home DM was restarted and
fingersticks monitored. No changes were made to her regimen
prior to discharge.

.
# Asthma: Home regimen of albuterol, pulmicort and tiotropium
were continued.

.
# Coagulopathy: at baseline probably due to underlying liver
disease.
.

# Follow-up: the patient has follow-up with the GI service,
Infectious Disease, Hepatology and her PCP (which she will make
