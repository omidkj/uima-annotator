Chief Complaint:
Acute kidney injury

Cystoscopy with ureteral stent placement

History of Present Illness:
79 year old female w/ CHF, Afib on coumadin who was transfered
from [**Hospital3 **] due to acute renal failure due to a 7mm L
ureteral stone complicated by a left forniceal rupture.

She originally presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] for failure to
thrive. She reported feeling "ill" for the past seven days with
vague abdominal pain associated with nausea, and had an episode
of falling out of bed on the Friday prior to admission. She
denies emesis, fevers, chills, or sweats. At [**Hospital1 **], she was
found to have left sided pleural effusions vs pneumonia and
L-sided flank pain. She was hemodynamically stable, however had
HHNK with FS 765, and metabolic abnormalities including Cr 3.8,
K 6.5, bicarb 17, bandemia 19%, and wbc 19. Pan-scan showed
left-sided ureteral stone, hydronephrosis, and forniceal
rupture. Her EKG at the time was stable in NSR with digoxin
effect (Dig 3.7). She received 3L IVF, 5U insulin, na-bicarb
(for potassium), as well as 1g vanco/ 3.375g zosyn. Urology at
[**Hospital1 **] requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] due to the complexity of her
presentation.

In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], her vitals were: T 98.7, HR 68, BP 134/46,
RR 20, O2 100% 2L. Exam showed mild diaphoresis, LLQ and left
CVA tenderness, and an elderly woman in mild distress. Labs were
significant for FS > [**2122**], Na 129, K 5.5, HCO3 15, Cr 3.4, Ca
7.5, WBC 19.7, Hct 29.4, Plt 397, INR 6.3. EKG showed afib @ 68
with digoxin effect. A UA showed many bacteria, > 182 WBCs, and
1000 glu. She was given 100 units of regular insulin x 2. She
was seen in the ED by urology, who recommended admission to the
ICU for treatment of her hyperkalemia, HHNK, and
super-therapeutic digitalis before IR-guided L percutaneous
nephrostomy tube tomorrow.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T 97.8, HR 71, BP
115/50, RR 28, O2 99%/2L

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2134-8-3**]):    NO GROWTH.
Blood culture [**8-1**]: PENDING

Imaging:
CXR [**8-2**]: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph,
patient has received a new internal jugular vein catheter on the
right.  The tip of the catheter projects over the mid-to-low
SVC.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no
pneumothorax. Increasing left pleural effusion with substantial
left lower lung atelectasis.

Retrograde urography [**8-2**]: FINDINGS:  21 spot fluoroscopic
images obtained without a radiologist present are submitted for
review.  Images demonstrate poor filling of the upper collecting
system.  Multiple filling defects are noted in the distal ureter
and the upper pole.  Images also demonstrate the placement of a
double-J stent.  Please consult the operative note in the online
medical record for further details.

CXR [**8-3**]: CONCLUSION: New mild right-sided pleural effusion.
Stability of the left moderate pleural effusion.

Renal U/S [**8-4**]: IMPRESSION:  There is mild bilateral
pelvocaliectasis without evidence of frank hydronephrosis.

EKG [**8-1**]: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular
response. Left ventricular hypertrophy. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

EKG [**8-2**]: Atrial fibrillation. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Probable digitalis effect. No major change from previous
tracing.

EKG [**8-2**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
and occasional ventricular ectopy. Q-T interval prolongation.
Diffuse non-specific ST segment changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2134-8-2**] ventricular ectopy has appeared.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old female with congestive heart failure, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin who was transfered from [**Hospital3 **]
due to acute renal failure due to a left ureteral stone,
complicated by urinary tract infection, hyperosmolar
hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome, supratherapeutic INR, and
digitalis toxicity.

Active issues:

# ACUTE KIDNEY FAILURE: Left ureterolithiasis and associated
hydroureter, hydronephrosis, perinephric stranding consistent
with forniceal rupture. Cr at 3.4 on admission. Urine output on
admission low at 10-15cc/hr. There was also a superimposed
urinary tract infection and acute tubular necrosis. The patient
was seen by urology who placed a
