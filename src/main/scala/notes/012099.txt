Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 yo male with h/o systolic heart failure with EF 20%,
HTN, and asymptomatic fib s/p recent cardioversion now admitted
after syncopal episode, found to be bradycardic. He was
anticoagulated for 4 weeks and cardioverted at [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday
for A fib with RVR and started newly on amiodarone. This morning
he was feeling weak and took Lasix 120mg and was walking up the
stairs on his way to use the bathroom when he had a near
syncopal event. He was caught by his family member, sustained no
head trauma, though he was + for LOC.
.
EMS arrived and he had a junctional rhythm at 50. He was
externally paced in the field and he received a total of 1 amp
of atropine for a bradycardia in the 30s and his SBP was in the
70s. He was brought to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**] and found to have a HR in
the 50s. He was started on a dopamine drip at 6mg. He desated to
90% on 4L and he needed to be started on a non rebreather with
sats at 98%. He was given Lasix 20mg IV x1. The pt voided a
total of 100cc at [**Location (un) 745**]-Wellesey. In transport the pt voided an
additional 240cc. Pt refuses foley catheter and demands to stand
to urinate. A CT scan was done at OSH to look for a bleed.

winded after climbing one flight of stairs
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, or palpitations.

Pertinent Results:
LABORATORY DATA on admission:
Creatinine 3.9
Mg 2.9
Ph 6
INR 2.3
WBC 13.4
.
EKG demonstrated NSR with left anterior hemiblock; EKG showed
conduction of P waves. T wave inversion in I and AVL and
question of Q waves in III and AVF and v1-v4 which have been
stable since prior EKG.
12-leads from NW show junctional escape rhythm at rate ~40.
EKG [**2180-6-12**]: Atrial flutter with variable block. Left axis
deviation. Left anterior fascicular block. Intraventricular
conduction delay. Late R wave progression.
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: NSR in 70s.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on demonstrated: [**2180-6-20**]
-EF of 20% with severe global hypokinesis
-left atrium is markedly dilated, right atrium is moderately
dilated.
-right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global
free wall hypokinesis
-trace aortic regurgitation
-moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
.
Portable CXR [**2180-6-24**]:
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. There is again
noted prominence of the interstitial markings consistent with
pulmonary edema. This is slightly increased since the previous
study. No pleural effusions are seen.
.
Renal u/s [**2180-6-25**]:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.2 cm, and the left kidney
measures
11.9 cm. There is mild right and moderate left hydronephrosis.
Multiple
bilateral cysts are seen, the largest measuring 4.8 cm in the
superior pole of the right kidney. The cortical thickness is
preserved.
Urinary bladder is distended, measuring 15.5 x 11.6 x 16.5 cm.
The prostate
is enlarged, measuring 7 x 6.5 x 6.3 cm.
IMPRESSION: Mild bilateral hydronephrosis most likely due to
prostate
hypertrophy, chronicity indeterminate.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 yo male with h/o HTN, CHF and EF of 20%, and recent
cardioversion for A fib who is s/p syncopal event with EKG
showing junctional bradycardia. Now hemodynamically stable in
sinus rhythm.
.
# Syncope/bradycardia:
Pt had junctional bradycardia with underlying sinus node
dysfunction leading to hemodynamic instability initially
requiring dopamine gtt. He had normal AV node conduction. Of
note he was on amiodarone, digoxin, and carvedilol, the levels
of which may have been increased in the setting of ARF. He meets
criteria for pacemaker/ICD placement but patient emphatically
refused despite being told that he could have recurrence of his
syncope without intervention.  He was monitored on telemetry
during his admission.  He was discontinued on digoxin and
amiodarone.  He was discharged on lower dose of carvedilol. He
has a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# Pump: He had acute on chronic diastolic and systolic HF. The
patient has a history of diastolic and systolic CHF with an EF
of 20%. Prior to admission his home dose of lasix was 80qAm and
40qPM although the morning prior to admission to the OSH he took
Lasix 120mg and received 20mg IV at the OSH. On presentation to
the CCU he desaturated and required a non rebreather mask in
order to maintain an oxygen saturation of 94%. On arrival to the
CCU he was volume overloaded on exam with diffuse crackles and
1+ pitting edema to the knee R>L.  He was continued on low dose
coreg but his lasix and ACE I were held given his acute renal
failure.  He was discharged on lasix 120mg daily.
.
# Rhythm:
The pt was in A fib until being cardioverted the day prior to
his admission.  On admission he had conducting P waves and a
long PR interval.  He was originally on a heparin drip in case
the decision was made to put in a pacer.
.
# Acute Renal Failure on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: he patient
has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 to 2.2.  On admission his
creatinine was 3.9 and it improved to 2.4 by the time of
discharge.  His renal failure was likely secondary to
obstruction from enlarged prostate which was seen on ultrasound.
 His urinary retention was likely exacerbated by the atropine
dose received on day of admission. The patient adamantly refused
a foley despite our recommendation.  His ACE, lasix, and digoxin
were held given his acute renal failure. He was discharged on
lasix 120mg daily.
.
# Abdominal distention: The patient had significant abdominal
distention during his admission.  He was having normal bowel
movements and no abdominal pain. His LFTs were normal with the
exception of an isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.  He
should follow up this abnormal lab value as an outpatient with
his PCP.
.
# Elevated WBC: The patient had an increased white cell count to
13. 4 on admission but was afebrile and asymptomatic.  His
UA/Ucx, blood cx, and CXR were all negati
