Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
54F w/ history of [**First Name3 (LF) 14165**] cell disease presenting with worsening
shortness of breath and cough. She has not been feeling well for
the past 3 weeks, initially with a cough productive of yellow
phlegm. She developed joint and chest pain c/w her [**First Name3 (LF) 14165**] crises
and became febrile to 101.2 on [**1-30**] with chills. She went to see
her PCP (w/ who she established in [**Month (only) 404**]) and was told to go
to the hospital. She reports she was admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital in [**Location (un) 8973**] through [**2-3**] and was treated with three
days of levofloxacin without significant improvement. Per her
report she was told she had to leave and so she drove to [**Location (un) 86**].
She has been living in her car since [**Month (only) 404**] due to problems
with her finances. In [**Location (un) 86**] she went to the Women's Lunch Place
and was seen by a physician who was concerned about her symptoms
and encouraged her to go to the [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.9 77 122/78 O2 sat 83% on RA,
100% on NRB. She triggered on arrival for hypoxia, but sats came
up 1o 100% on non rebreather. Dialed down to NC- 97% on 4L.
Patient underwent CXR which showed mild interstitial edema and
bibasilar atelectasis. She had CTA chest which showed
subsegmental bilateral pulmonary emboli, evidence of pulmonary
hypertension with a dilated PA (3.5 cm), and pulmonary edema and
dilated hepatic veins suggestive of heart failure. She received
1 g of cefepime, zofran, 0.5 mg dilaudid, and was started on a
heparin gtt w/ bolus. One liter of NS was hung prior to
admission. VS on transfer were: HR 62 109/61 RR 18 100% on
non-rebreather.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient denies pain. She exhibits
increased latency of speech and a restricted affect. She denies
h/o recent immobility, surgery or malignancy.

.
IMAGING:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, [**2139-2-6**]:
1. Multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the upper and lower
lobes bilaterally. No CT evidence of right heart strain.
2. Mildly dilated main pulmonary artery and intrapulmonary
arterial branches, findings suggestive of pulmonary
hypertension.
3. Evidence of moderate pulmonary edema.
4. Band-like basilar opacities which could reflect atelectasis
though are nonspecific.
5. Right medial lower lobe pleural based mass consistent with
extramedullary hematopoiesis.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN [**2139-2-7**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. No
dilated air-filled loops of bowel to suggest obstruction or
ileus. No definite free air. If clinically indicated, CT may
help for more detailed assessment
.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2139-2-7**]: No evidence of DVT
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) [**2139-2-7**]:
1. Nonvisualization of the gallbladder is likely secondary to
prior
cholecystectomy reported by patient.
2. Spleen not well visualized, possibly shrunken secondary to
autosplenectomy in the setting of [**Month/Day/Year 14165**] cell disease.
3. Normal-appearing liver.
.
CXR portable [**2139-2-8**]:
1. CHF with interstitial edema, similar to [**2139-2-6**].
2. Patchy opacities at both bases, similar but slightly worse
compared with [**2139-2-6**]. These could represent atelectasis or
scarring, though the possibility of infectious infiltrate,
cannot be excluded.
.
TTE [**2139-2-9**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests
normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Dilated ascending
aorta. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
.
[**2139-2-15**] CT ABD/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
There are increased interstitial markings within the lung bases
bilaterally
suggestive of pulmonary edema. There is cardiomegaly. No pleural
effusion.
A calcified granuloma within the right lung base (2:8), is
stable measuring 3 mm.

The liver is diffusely increased in attenuation. No ill-defined
hypodensity
within the dome of the liver at the junction of segment
