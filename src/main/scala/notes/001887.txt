Please see the prior discharge summary dictation, dated [**2122-7-1**], for the initial portion of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course.

On [**2122-7-1**], the patient was transferred to the Surgery
Intensive Care Unit for hypotension.  She was thought to be
in sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection and aspiration
pneumonia.  The patient was treated with Ceftriaxone and
Flagyl.  There was some concern that the patient was also
intravascularly depleted from over-diuresis and she was
started on some fluids.  The patient stabilized and was
transferred out to the floor, still on antibiotics and
intermittent intravenous Lasix dose.  The patient again
became hypervolemic and fluid-overloaded.  Since on the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**] they were not able to start Lasix or Dopamine drip,
she was transferred to the Surgery Intensive Care Unit again
for Lasix and Dopamine drips.  She responded well.  Since it
was felt that she did not meet Intensive Care Unit level
care, but the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] [**Hospital1 **] Services were not able to
administer Lasix drip the patient was transferred instead to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] [**Hospital1 **] Service.  She was initially going to be
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] but it was decided ultimately that she
should instead be on the Regular Medicine [**Hospital1 **] Team to be
followed by the Congestive Heart Failure Service.  On the
[**Hospital Ward Name 517**], the patient was continued on Lasix drip with
good diuresis.  She did not require any Dopamine drip and her
blood pressure remained stable throughout the remainder of
the hospitalization.  The Congestive Heart Failure Service
followed the patient throughout the remainder of the
hospitalization.  They recommended stopping Sinemet as well
as Theophylline.  The patient was meeting her intake and
output goals for -1500 cc.  However, her weight did not
significantly change.  At the time of discharge her weight
was 95.1 kg which was still up from her dry weight of 88 kg.
The patient was switched to Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. which was
slightly more than the total amount of Lasix she was
receiving on the Lasix drip.

In terms of infection, the patient has completed a 14 day
course of Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for Escherichia coli urinary
tract infection and aspiration pneumonia.  She was also noted
to have vaginal irritation and a yeast infection and was
started on vaginal Miconazole for a total seven day course
which improved her symptoms.  Repeat urine culture then grew
Enterococcus.  The patient was started on Vancomycin
intravenously.  Sensitivities are not available at this time.
Prior to discharge the patient developed an episode of
shaking chills, although she never spiked a temperature and
never became hypodynamically stable.  Blood cultures were
sent and eventually one out of four bottles grew gram
positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  The patient was
already on Vancomycin at that time and given that it was only
in one out of four cultures, it was felt to be a contaminate,
possibly.  Nonetheless, the patient will be started for a
total two week course of Vancomycin.  Stool was also sent for
Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium difficile remained
negative.  Repeat urinalysis showed only occasional bacteria
and 3 to 5 white blood cells.  Repeat chest x-ray showed no
pneumonia and improving congestive heart failure.

The patient continued to complain of chronic bilateral lower
extremity pain especially in the foot.  The patient was
continued on increased dose of Gabapentin.  The patient had
previously been on Fentanyl although she stated that this is
not helping and it was decided to stop the Fentanyl.  She was
started instead on OxyContin which was eventually titrated up
to 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Further changes in her pain management
can be managed as an outpatient.

Since the patient was hemodynamically stable, and was
diuresing on Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., it was decided to send
her to rehabilitation.  The patient was to continue on a 2 gm
sodium diet as well as 1500 cc fluid restriction.  She will
continue on Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. with daily weight checks.
The patient will have close follow up with the outpatient
congestive heart failure clinic.  She will continue to
receive Vancomycin intravenously for the positive urine
culture as well as a question of a possible right lower
extremity cellulitis as well as the one out of four positive
blood cultures growing gram positive cocci in pairs and
clusters.
