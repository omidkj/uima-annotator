Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9180**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization with stenting to right coronary artery

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year-old male with history of type 2 diabetes
mellitus and ESRD on hemodialysis who was admitted to the CCU
after an NSTEMI.  He had intially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
emergency department with 4 to 6 hours of crushing chest pain
and shortness of breath that occurred while he was watching
television.  He rated the pain [**9-16**] and reports that it did not
radiate. The pain was accompanied by diaphoresis, nausea,
vomiting, and severe shortness of breath.  He called EMS for
further assistance.  He received 3 sublinqual nitroglycerin and
IV lasix with relief of the pain.  On arrival to [**Last Name (LF) 1474**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
EKG showed ST depressions in the anterolateral leads with
inverted T waves.  A chest x-ray was notable for pulmonary
edema.  He had elevated cardiac enzymes.  He received plavix and
heparin and was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**].  He underwent cardiac
catherization that reveal 3 vessel disease.  A stent was placed
in the right coronary.  He was transfered to the CCU. with the
goal of CABG with LIMA-LAD and SVG-diagnol.  On arrival to the
CCU, he was chest pain free.

Liver Ultrasound: Normal Study.

Cardiac Catherization: Right dominant circulation. The LMCA was
short and heavily calcified with a distal taper. The LAD had a
proximal eccentric 80% lesion and the distal vessel had a
tubular 70% lesion. Numerous diagonal arteries were without
critical lesions. The left circumflex was a non-dominant vessel
with heavy calcifications. Only a ramus was seen and it was
occluded proximally. The RCA was a dominant vessel with a
proximal 99% lesion. The abdominal aorta was found to have
moderate diffuse disease with iliac aneurysmal dilation and poor
distal flow to the CFA. The RCA was stented with a 3.0 x 18
Cypher. The final residual was 0% with normal flow.
.
Echocardiogram: EF of 40-45% with moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63 year-old male admitted with NSTEMI.
.
1) NSTEMI: He was admitted with an NSTEMI.  Cardiac
catherization revealed three vessel disease.  He had a stent
placed in his right coronary.  A post-catherization
echocardiogram showed mildly dilated left atrium, mild global
hypokinesis, and an ejection fraction of 40-45%.  The initial
plan was to undergo CABG to address is left circumflex and left
anterior descending disease.  During the pre-operative work-up,
he was found to have totally occluded bilateral internal carotid
arteries.  Therefore, he was deemed to not be a surgical
candidate.  He was medically managed with aspirin, high dose
statin, beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor, and Plavix.  His cardiac
enzymes trended down and he had no further chest pain.  He was
discharged with cardiology follow-up.
.
2) End stage renal disease: He was maintained on his regular
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday dialysis.  He received epoetin with
dialysis and was maintained on Nephrocaps and phosphate binders.
 His dialysis flow sheets during this admission were faxed to
his outpatient dialysis center.  He was discharged to continue
his regular dialysis.
.
3) Status post CVA: The details of his CVA are unknown.  He was
supposedly on dilantin, but his level was subtherapeutic.  He
was maintained on his outpatient dilantin while in house.  He
was maintained on aspirin and Plavix for secondary prophylaxis.

.
4) COPD: He had no active issues.  He was maintained on
albuterol and Atrovent inhalers.
.
5) Elevated LFT's: His elevated LFTs were thought to be
secondary to alcohol intake or Statin use.  A right upper
quadrant ultrasound was normal, and his LFTs remained stable
throughout the admission.  He will need his LFTs followed as an
outpatient.
.
6) Diabetes: He was not taking any medications at home for his
diabetes.  His A1c on admission was 6.1.  His sugars remained
under good control with minimal coverage with an insulin sliding
scale.  His blood sugars and A1c should be monitored as an
outpatient.
.
7) FEN: He was maintained on a renal, cardiac, and diabetic
diet.  He was maintained on phosphate binders.
.
8) Code: Full.
.
9) Dispo: On the day after his catherization, he wanted to leave
AMA.  At the time, he was delirious and could demonstrate that
he understood the gravity of his medical condition.  Psychiatry
evaluated him and felt that he did not have the capacity to
leave AMA.  He subsequently cleared his delirium.  His son was
involved and wanted to take the patient home with him.  The
patient was discharged in the care of his son who would help
monitor his medications and follow-up appointments.  Psychiatry
also recommended behavioral neurology follow-up as well and
neuropsychiatry testing.
