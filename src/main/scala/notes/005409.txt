Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
hematuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cystoscopy


History of Present Illness:
.
Hx per prior notes. Patient sedated (after CT scan in ED) upon
presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
86 F [**Hospital 100**] Rehab patient who is s/p pessary placement 5 days
ago. The patient has been having hematuria for the past 2 weeks.
On the day of admission the patient complained of lower
abdominal pain and had profuse hematuria for four hours.
.
An initial Hct had been checked at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**9-25**] and was
28, by afternoon it was 25. The patient became increasingly
tachycardic with a stable BP at 120/63 and worsening bleeding.
She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation. In the ED her Hct was
21.6. She received 4U of PRBC and hct improved to 35.4. Vaginal
exam did not reveal a pessary.
.
In the ED, Gyn did not feel that the bleeding was vaginal. No
pessary was noted during speculum exam. The ED staff placed a
18Fr 3 way foley overnight and it immediately drained 200cc of
clot and urine. Urology later removed the 3 way foley and placed
a 22F 2-way foley removing 700cc of dark clot with hand
irrigation. Bedside cystoscopy revealed an inflammed
trabeculated bladder consistent with cystitis or Foley
catheterization, no appreciable erosion, no significant retained
clot, no large tumor, no foreign body, and no active bleeding. A
3-way 22F [**Last Name (un) **] catheter was placed with the foley to gravity
draining clear urine. Ceftriaxone was given for UTI. Preliminary
[**Location (un) 1131**] was unremarkable.
.
In the ED, the patient was very agitated and given a variety of
medications: 10mg IV haldol, 4mg IV ativan, 4mg IV morphine.

stranding surrounding the kidneys. Cystic lesions in both
kidneys, probably a cyst, however, too small to characterize. No
definitive finding to explain hematuria.
2. Gallstone with mildly distended gallbladder, without
pericholecystic fluid. Please correlate clinically for the
possibility of cholecystitis.
3. Sigmoid diverticulosis.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusion with atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hemmorhagic cystitis -- unclear etiology, cystoscopy showed
friable tissues, but no mass or erosions.  Hematocrit has been
stable since transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and urine has been clear of
blood.  No evidence of UTI.  Aspirin and Plavix were held on
admission, and my recommendation is Plavix be discontinued
permanently.  A baby aspirin can likely be resumed on discharge.

# Urinary retention: Pt has chronic urinary retention [**3-12**]
uterine prolapse. She is s/p pessary placement 5 days prior to
admission, however pessary has since fallen out.  She has
required straight catheterization x1 after foley was
discontinued, however the geriatrics team feels the management
of her urinary retention at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with bladder massage,
etc., can be successfully resumed on discharge.  She should
follow up with her gynecologist regarding the uterine prolapse
and pessarie.

# Orthostatic hypotension: Known history of autonomic
instability at baseline. Initiated florinef one day prior to
discharge with some improvement in her orthostasis.  Cortisol,
B12 and folate pending on discharge.  TSH and HgA1c within
normal limits.

# CAD: Hold Plavix indefinitely, resume baby aspirin on
discharge.

# Dementia/Agitation: Pt received 10mg IV haldol, 4mg IV ativan,
and 4mg IV morphine for agitation in the ED. She was initially
somnolent on arrival to the ICU, but improved overnight.  She
continued to have sundowning, but improved significantly in the
last 24 hours.  The geriatrics team feels immediate transfer
back to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab will only improve her mental status.  This
has been discussed with her primary physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who
agreed with this plan.

Plan discussed by phone with daughter, [**Name (NI) 1154**] [**Name (NI) **].
