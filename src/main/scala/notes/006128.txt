CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status, chronic abdominal
pain and anal fissure pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year-old
female with end stage renal disease on HD, chronic left
abdominal pain felt to be secondary to a surgical incision,
recently diagnosed anal fissures who presented with change in
mental status in the setting of Methadone that was started a
week prior to admission for her chronic pain.  The patient
was followed in the Pain Clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41134**].  The patient
has tried Tylenol #3 with little relief, so was started on
Methadone one week prior to admission, but despite
significant relief experienced confusion and hallucinations
and inability to care for herself.  At baseline the patient
is mostly independent.  The Methadone was discontinued with
return of pain, but change in mental status consistent.  The
patient describes the pain as being constant, severe, sharp
and localized to the left lower quadrant.  The patient also
has new anal pain from fissure.  No fever.  Positive
seventeen pound weight loss over the last five months,
positive anorexia.  She requires much coaxing to eat meals.
No neurologic symptoms.  No bowel or bladder incontinence.
No melena.  Very little urine output, which is chronic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repaired,
aorta-femoral bypass, [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease status post ablation and
is now hypothyroid, coronary artery bypass graft status post
four vessel bypass, end stage renal disease secondary to
hypertension on HD, left abdominal wall mass thought
secondary to neuroma, chronic pain secondary to questionable
neuroma, anal fissure and anxiety.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa causes angioedema.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Methadone 2.5 mg t.i.d., which was
discontinued prior to admission.  Nifedipine XL 90 mg po q
day, Megace 800 mg po q.a.m.,, 400 mg po q.p.m., Nephrocaps,
Levoxyl 50 micrograms po q day, Ativan 1 mg prn given at HD,
Pericolace 100 mg po t.i.d., Niferex 150 mg po q day, aspirin
81 mg po q day, Tums EX 300 mg po t.i.d., Remeron 30 mg
q.h.s., Lidocaine jelly 2% to anal fissure as needed.

left upper quadrant adjacent to rib cage.  Slightly tender to
palpation.  Rectal no external erythema.  Guaiac negative per
Emergency Department examination.  Extremities 2+ pedal
edema.  Neurological alert and oriented times two.  Date is
[**2167**], month [**Month (only) 116**], President [**Last Name (un) 2450**], new address as [**Hospital1 3494**]
only.  Strength 5 out of 5.  Deep tendon reflexes 2+
throughout.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 17.3,
hematocrit 37.0, platelets 294, 87% neutrophils, 7%
lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 1.5% eosinophils, .2% basophils.
PT/PTT/INR within normal limits.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.6,
chloride 100, bicarb 25, BUN 51, creatinine 6.3, glucose 122.
Urinalysis had 3 to 5 white blood cells and few bacteria.
Urine culture has been negative.  Cerebral spinal fluid, no
white blood cells, no red blood cells.  Gram stain negative.
Culture negative.  Glucose 71, protein 28.  Chest x-ray
consistent with mild fluid overload likely left effusion with
atelectasis, left IJ HD catheter in place.  CT of head no
intracranial hemorrhage.  Blood cultures 4 out of 4 bottles
negative to date.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After the patient's admission on [**5-21**] for
management of pain and workup of dental MS, the patient
developed acute onset of hypoxia and shortness of breath on
the night of admission.  The patient was found to be in flash
pulmonary edema and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
emergent dialysis.  The patient could not hve standard HD due
to hypotension, so underwent CVVHD.  Apparently as an
outpatient HD had been unsuccessful for the last two weeks
due to hypotension.  In the Coronary Care Unit the patient
was started on Vancomycin, Levo and Flagyl for questionable
pneumonia on chest x-ray in the setting of increased white
blood cell count.  There was a questionable left lower lobe
infiltrate, however, this was also seen on chest x-ray report
from [**11-27**] from an outside hospital.  Vancomycin was
discontinued on day number two, but the patient was still
kept on Levo and Flagyl to finish a ten day course for
questionable aspiration pneumonia.  In the context of her
flash pulmonary edema the patient had increased troponin with
peak at 6.9 with negative CK.  The patient was started on
Plavix during her Coronary Care Unit stay.  On the a.m. of
[**2167-5-25**] the patient was found to be hypotensive and had
increased white blood cell count and decreased bicarb with
increased lactate.

Also all was felt to be consistent with hyperperfusion.  It
was felt that the patient had too much fluid removed with
CVVHD as she was dialyzed to 39 kilos, which is below her dry
weight.  Hypotension responded to normal saline boluses 250
cc times two.  The patient's blood pressure returned to about
100/doppler where it has been since.

In terms of her mental status, it seems to wax and wane.  She
has been calling for help.  She was started on Seraquel and
given Haldol prn with good effect.  The patient was
transferred back to the floor on [**2167-5-25**], because it was felt
that her volume overload was resolved.

HOSPITAL COURSE FROM [**5-25**] TO [**2167-5-28**]:  1.  Cardiovascular:
the patient continued on her aspirin, however, her
beta blocker was held due to hypotension.  Plavix was also
discontinued as it was felt her acute possible ischemia was
resolved.  It was noted that the patient would benefit from
an ace, however, because her blood pressure has remained low
she has not started this medication.  She is being continued
on aspirin as her only medication for coronary artery
disease.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient had a left lower lobe infiltrate
that was noted on previous x-rays, however, she was started
on Levo and Flagyl for presumptive aspiration pneumonia.
This was thought to be in the setting of mental status
change.  The patient will finish a course of Levo and Flagyl
on [**2167-5-31**].  The patient had a persistent left pleural
effusion for which a diagnostic tap was done on [**2167-5-28**].
Results of that tap are still pending.  An addendum to this
dictation with the results of that thoracentesis.

3.  Leukocytosis of unclear origin:  The patient had multiple
blood cultures, cerebral spinal fluid cultures and urine
cultures sent, which have all been negative to date.  The
patient has remained with a low grade temperature of 99 to
100 at times, however, over the last 48 hours she has
remained afebrile.  It is unclear what this leukocytosis is
due to.  At first it was thought to be a stress response to
flash pulmonary edema, however, edema has resolved and the
patient has not had improvement of her white blood cell
count.  Awaiting the r
