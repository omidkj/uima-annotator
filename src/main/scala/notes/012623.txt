Physical Exam:
VS: T97.7 HR 95 BP 121/76 RR 20 02 95% RA

Constitutional: NAD
Neuro: Alert and oriented to person, place and time
Cardiac: RRR, NL S1,S2
Lungs: CTA bilaterally
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender to palpation, no rebound
tenderness/guarding
Wounds: Abd midline incision, open to air, intact, no periwound
erythema, no drainage; JP insertion site without erythema or
drainage; G-tube insertion
Ext: No edema


Pertinent Results:
[**2154-12-2**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay and
left bundle-branch block with secondary ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2152-10-27**] no diagnostic
interval change

[**2154-12-3**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Atrio-ventricular conduction delay.
Left atrial abnormality.  Left bundle-branch block. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2154-12-2**] the findings are similar

[**2154-12-3**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**7-27**]:
Lung volumes are lower and there is a mild-to-moderate degree of
subsegmental atelectasis at both lung bases. Upper lungs are
clear. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable and there is no good
evidence of pulmonary edema. Small left pleural effusion may be
present. No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube passes below the
diaphragm and out of view. Likely an epidural catheter
projecting over the midline but course indeterminate \

[**2154-12-4**]:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary embolism in the right superior lobar segmental
artery.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than the
left.
3. Small right lower lobe consolidation, likely atelectasis,
although in the proper clinical setting could represent
aspiration or pneumonia.
4. Post-surgical air within the mediastinum.
5. Small amount of fluid in the lesser sac, likely
postoperative.
6. Normal postoperative appearance of Roux-en-Y without evidence
of leaks or adjacent fluid collections.

[**2154-12-6**]:
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT: IMPRESSION: Superficial
thrombophlebitis of the right cephalic vein

[**2154-12-6**]:
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower
extremity DVT

[**2154-12-9**]:
ECHO: Suboptimal image quality. Borderline left ventricular
cavity enlargement with extensive systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Pulmonary artery
hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2154-4-23**], left ventricular dysfunction is more pronounced c/w
interim ischemia.

[**2154-12-9**]:
ECG: Sinus tachycardia with first degree A-V delay. Frequent
ventricular premature beats. Intraventricular conduction delay
of the left bundle-branch block type. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2154-12-3**] the rate is faster and ventricular ectopy is
new.

[**2154-12-9**]:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is no evidence of pneumothorax on the
current radiograph. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are unchanged
associated with small amount of pleural effusion. Infectious
process in the lung bases, in particularly on the right, cannot
be excluded

[**2154-12-9**]:
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT: The right internal jugular line tip
is at the level of superior SVC. Within the limitations of this
extremely lordotic and limited radiograph, no evidence of
complications demonstrated. Left upper mediastinal drain is
partially imaged.

[**2154-12-9**]:
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST: IMPRESSION:
1. A large collection from the distal esophagus into the upper
mid abdomen
that contains gas bubbles and debris within it, compatible with
an abscess, which is most probably secondary to a leak.
2. Enlarging lesser sac fluid collection as described.
3. Small fluid collection just anterior to the first part of the
duodenum.
4. Small right pneumothorax.
5. Right pleural effusion with secondary atelectasis.

[**2154-12-9**]: BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT: IMPRESSION: Leak at the
gastrojejunal anastomosis

[**2154-12-11**]: ECHO: IMPRESSION:Severe global left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with potential regionality

[**2154-12-12**]: ECHO: IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate global left
ventricular systoilc dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitaiton.
Mild pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2154-12-11**], biventricular systolic function
has improved.

[**2154-12-13**]: CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT
New left IJ catheter tip is at the confluence of the
brachiocephalic veins.  There is no evident pneumothorax. New
right basal pleural catheter is in place. Right pleural effusion
has decreased. There are no other interval changes.

[**2154-12-14**]: CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION: 1. Several fluid loculations in the right h
