Occasional chest tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2103-4-3**] Replacment of Ascending Aorta and Hemiarch(34mm Gelweave
Graft) and Single Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
utilizing the left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old male who underwent nasal surgery in
[**2102-9-30**] which was complicated by atrial fibrillation,
bradycardia and hypotension. Cardiac evaluation at that time
revealed single vessel coronary artery disease and ascending
aortic aneurysm measuring 6.4 centimeters. Echocardiogram showed
only mild aortic insufficiency and an LVEF of 65%. Based upon
the above, he was referred for cardiac surgical intervention.

[**2103-4-3**] Intraop TEE:
Pre Bypass: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is markedly dilated, (6.9 cm in proximal
ascending, 5.6 cm at the distal ascending just prior to the
aortic arch. The aortic arch is moderately dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is moderately dilated and tortuous. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet
is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Post Bypass: Patient is a-paced on phenylepherine infusion.
Preserved biventricular function LVEF >55%. Aortic Insufficiency
is now trace to mild. A tube graft is partially visualized above
the sinotubular junction extending into the ascending aorta.
Flow appears laminar in the proximal graft. Remaining aortic
contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
[**2103-4-9**] Chest x-ray: A small right apical pneumothorax is
slightly decreased in size with chest tube remaining in place in
the lower right hemithorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are
stable in the postoperative period. Small left pleural effusion
is again demonstrated. A small amount of subcutaneous emphysema
is present in the right chest wall adjacent to the chest tube
insertion site.

73 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
HISTORY: 73-year-old man status post coronary artery bypass and
ascending aortic replacement.

COMPARISON: [**2103-4-9**].

CHEST PA AND LATERAL: The post-operative appearance of the
cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary
vasculature is unremarkable. The lungs are clear. The small
right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are stable. Right-sided chest tube is again noted.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged small right pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**4-2**]. Preoperative evaluation
was unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery. On [**4-3**],
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed replacement of ascending aorta and
hemiarch along with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
Following the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. Low dose beta
blockade was resumed and diuretics were initiated. He maintained
stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative
day two. He experienced atrial fibrillation on postoperative day
three and was started on Amiodarone. He successfully converted
back to normal sinus rhythm. Amiodarone was titrated accordingly
and beta blockade was advanced as tolerated. Given his history
atrial fibrillation, he was started on Warfarin. Dr. [**Known lastname **] also
required replacement of a right sided chest tube for a residual
pneumothorax. He was followed closely by serial chest x-rays and
by discharge, his pneumothorax had significantly improved and
his chest tube was discontinued.

Prior to discharge, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1683**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] who agreed to
monitor his PT/INR as an outpatient. Warfarin should be dosed
for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5. First blood draw is scheduled
for Friday [**4-13**].

He was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative
day #8.
