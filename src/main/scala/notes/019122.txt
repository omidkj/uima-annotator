from splenic flexure to rectum but also around cecum showing

diverticuli in colon, left sided hip prosthesis, DJD in right
hip, aorta with multiple atheroma
CXR: mild fluffy opacities consistent with pulmonary edema

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old man with c.difficile pancolitis, in
the setting of recent levofloxacin use. He also presented a
troponin leak from likely demand ischemia. Recently, he had a
normal TSH ruling out hyperthyroidism as an etiology and a
virtual colonoscopy that showed no colonic lesions though there
was poor visualization of the descending colon and no
intraabdominal masses or other pathology.

1. C. diff pancolitis

In terms of his colitis, Mr. [**Known lastname 31337**] stool was negative for
toxin A on several occasional but positive for c.difficile toxin
B. He had multiple bowel movements per day, usually OB positive,
and he even had an episode of melena. He was made NPO and
started on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl in additional to morphine
and tylenol for pain. He was followed by surgery and GI but it
was felt that there were no indications for intervention since
he's a poor surgical candidate and colonoscopy could potentially
perforate the colon.

He continued to improve with diarrhea resolving.  He remained on
po vancomycin for this infection. He will complete a course of
po vancomycin for about two months in
total.

2. VRE UTI/Bacteremia

Mr. [**Known lastname **] made progress in his recovery until he spiked a
fever. His blood cultures grew 4/4 bottles of VRE on [**1-11**] and
4/4 bottles on [**1-12**]; he was started on linezolid. He appears to
have seeded his blood from his urine where his urine culture
grew out 10,000 colonies of VRE [**1-6**]. His PICC was pulled. He
had a TTE to r/o evidence of endocarditis.  Of note, he had an
AICD placed in [**11-22**].  THe TTE did not show any evidence of
endocarditis.  He then underwent a TEE which showed no evidence
of endocarditis.

- An initial CT abd/pelvis on admission raised the possibility
of intravesical air as a sign of entero-vesical fistula (which
might explain the VRE uti and subsequent bacteremia
- A f/u CT abd/pelvis was done with rectal contrast to evaluate
for this possibility. While the rectal contrast did not reach
high enough to directly visualize a potential fistula, there was
no evidence of intra-vesical air on this study, making a fistula
less likely.

*** will f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in ID
- plan 4 weeks of po linezolid 600 [**Hospital1 **] (start date of [**1-13**] -
first date of negative cultures)
- f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2-9**] at 9:30 AM
- will f/u with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4035**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 976**] after d/c

*** will need f/u TEE.

*** will need weekly CBC to follow for cytopenias with linezolid
therapy.

3. Chronic renal insufficiency:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] has chronic renal insufficiency, with a baseline
1.7-2.0. He was initially thought to be prerenal from CHF
combined with contrast induced ARF. Within 3 days of admission,
he became oliguric and hypotensive. He was sent to the MICU
where he was fluid resuscitated with 8 liters. His hypotension,
oliguria, and acute renal failure resolved within a few days. He
was transferred back to the floor, where he was effectively
diuresed without precipitating a rise in creatinine.
Creatinine on discharge was 1.5; lasix and ACE-I were held on
account of
bump in crn from 1.2 to 1.5

4. Troponin leak:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a troponin leak which was thought to be secondary
to congestive heart failure. He has an EF of < 20%, and was
initially started ASA, with continuation of his statin. His
Lisinopril and metoprolol were initially discontinued, as he was
hypotensive. They were both restarted once he stabilized.

5. Urinary retention:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] has urinary retention.  Once his foley was pulled, he
was able to urinate. The Tamsulosin was continued.

6. Hypothyroidism:

For his hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine was continued.

7. COPD:

For his COPD, he was continued on
albuterol/ipratropium/fluticasone MDIs in addition to nebulizer
treatments. He no longer required oxygen by the end of his stay.

8. Oral candidiasis:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] had oral candidiasis in addition to urinary [**Female First Name (un) **].
He was treated with one dose of fluconazole and nystatin swish
and swallow.
