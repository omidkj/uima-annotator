Chest CT scan [**12-20**]
1. No evidence of PE.
2. 4.9 cm suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
3. Right lower lobe consolidation with volume loss and air
bronchograms and associated effusion. This most likely
represents atelectasis given the rapid development when multiple
plain radiographs obtained today are compared. However,
superinfection cannot be excluded.
4. Cardiomegaly with CHF.
.
EKG [**12-20**]
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Right axis deviation.
Right
bundle-branch block. Delayed anterior precordial R wave
progression.
Cannot exclude prior anterior myocardial infarction. No previous
tracing
available for comparison
.
Bronchial Lavage
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77M with history of COPD, afib, CAD admitted with
respiratory failure.
.
# Respiratory failure: Per report, intubated for hypoxic resp
failure at OSH; however, had hypercapnia on initial ABG at [**Hospital1 **],
c/w COPD flare (likely w/ elevated CO2 levels at baseline).
Differential includes COPD exacerbation vs PE (given acute
onset, Rt axis on EKG). No evidence of PNA, ARDS or other lung
pathology on initial CXR other than chronic changes of COPD;
however, CTA on [**12-21**] was negative for PE and showing RLL
collapse. Bronchoscopy on [**12-21**] was unremarkable for obstructing
lesion or other pathology. BAL and cytology were collected.
Nasopharyngeal aspirate negative for influenza. Patient is
clinically stable and ready for extubation.
-extubated [**12-22**]
-Cont ceftriaxone/azithro to cover CAP/COPD exacerbation -
completed azithro  [**12-23**], recommend 3 more days of ceftriaxone
-Steroids: Rapid taper - now off
-Inhalers
-f/u micro data
-f/u OSH micro - none available
-f/u OSH labs (CBC, ABG, CHEM 10)
The patient was managed for his COPD exacerbation with pulse
steroids, antibiotics, and intensifying his CODP inhaler
therapies. He gradually improved and on discharge was nearly at
baseline.
.
# CAD: Enzymes negative X3. Has CAD/ischemic CM by report.
-cont aspirin, statin.
-Consider adding BB, ace-I prior to d/c
.
# Rhythm: Currently in sinus, has h/o PAF. Not on coumadin at
home.
-d/w PCP reason for not anticoagulation
-Cont aspirin
-continue to monitor on tele
.
# Pump: h/o CHF, EF 35% by prior d/c summary. Slightly
overloaded by most recent CXR s/p volume resuscitation.
-obtain OSH records
-likely will need to diurese tomorrow
-Digoxin subtherapeutic, will continue.
.
# Hyperglycemia: in setting of steroids. No h/o DM.
-QID fingersticks, HISS, titrate insulin PRN for tight control
.
#CKD: At baseline.
-gentle IVF in preparation for CTA
-trend Cr
-place foley, follow strict I/Os
-f/u UA, Ucx
.
#Leukocytosis: In setting of steroids; may be due to steroids vs
representative of underlying infection. + left shift.
-Trend WBC, f/u diff
-f/u micro data as above
-cont empiric abx for now
-obtain initial CBC from OSH presentation
.
# Hyperlipidemia: cont statin
.
# HTN: holding CCB at present. Consider BB/Ace-I prior to
discharge given CHF
.
# F/E/N: IVF as above. Replete lytes PRN. NPO at present.
.
# PPx: Bowel regimen, PPI, sq Heparin
.
# Access: PIV's: 1 20g and 2 18g's
.
# Code Status: Full (confirmed w/ wife and daughter-[**Name (NI) 3508**] on
