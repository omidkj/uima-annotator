History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with history of seizure disorder, recently
discharged from epilepsy service [**6-8**] after hospital course with
STEMI, RLL PNA, and NCSE.  At that time her keppra was increased
from 750 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and depakote was added (initially
200 mg IV q8h then changed to sprinkles 250/375).  She took
several days to awaken and track and start eating, but was not
thought to have recovered to her baseline at time of discharge.
She was noted to not speak or follow commands but tracks and
swallows at time of discharge to [**Hospital1 599**] [**Location (un) 55**] [**2192-6-8**].

During her last hospitalization she was initially CMO but after
discussion with her family she was changed to DNR/DNI.

She returned with recurrent seizures.  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] RN at her
nursing home (who was not there at time of event) she was told
the patient was seizing for 30 minutes up to one hour starting
around 6:45 AM.  She did not receive her AM medications.  While
en route to [**Hospital1 18**] she had two more GTCs lasting 2-3 minutes each
and received 2 mg lorazepam.


Past Medical History:
seizure disorder, diagnosed in [**8-23**] of unclear etiology.  Has
episodes of speech arrest with gaze deviation, occasional GTCs,
and recently NCSE.  Initially treated with benzo/dilantin load
which led to respiratory depression and intubation.  Started on
keppra in [**10-25**], and depakote recently added in setting of NCSE.

Social History:
Immigrant from [**Country 38213**]; lived at home with son. At baseline, the

smoking, or ETOH use

HEAD CT
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal due to patient motion without acute
intracranial
process seen.

EEG [**2192-6-12**]
This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of
nearly continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges
(PLEDs)
at about 1 Hz frequency over the left hemisphere which represent
highly
epileptogenic cortex in this region. The PLEDs improved in the
night
after 22:00 and became reduced in amplitude, less well formed,
more
broad-based, and less periodic, as well as more focally
localized to the
left temporal leads. There were no corresponding clinical
changes on
video with the PLEDs. Also seen were left hemisphere and left
anterior
temporal interictal discharges indicating focal epileptogenic
cortex.
The background was slow representing a moderate encephalopathy.
There
were no clear electrographic seizures.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with history of seizure disorder, recently discharged
from the [**Hospital1 18**] epilepsy service [**6-8**] after hospital course with
STEMI, RLL PNA, and NCSE.  She returned after prolonged
generalized tonic clonic seizure at nursing home followed by two
more seizures in route. She had not received her morning seizure
medications.
Depakote level was subtherapeutic on presentation. She was
loaded with Depakote and her home dose was continued. She was
also continued on Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **]. She was found to be
febrile with leukocytosis and a dirty UA, which may have
triggered this event for which she was treated with ceftriaxone.
CXR showed mild worsening of previously present R lower lobe
infiltrate concerning for aspiration PNA. She had already
completed a course of broad spectrum antibiotics for this on her
last admission. She was continued on ceftriaxone only.

During the week prior to her demise, Ms. [**Known lastname 79941**] unfortunately
remained in a state of diminished responsiveness continuous left
sided PLEDs on EEG. The family refused an NG tube with the
understanding that she may wake up following her prolonged
seizure and begin to eat again. There were several days without
any form of nutrition other than continuous IV fluids. She
continued to receive treatment for her infection as above.
Intermittently, she would spike a new WBC and this would improve
with the expansion of IV antibiotics. The family of the patient
refused to transition her to CMO status, and therefore we
continued to treat her with multiple AEDs and titrate levels,
etc. She eventually began to develop daily episodes of tachypnea
with occasional oxygen desaturations down to the 80s, which
would improve with repositioning and increasing FiO2. It
ultimately got to a point where the patient was on a 100% NRB
oxygen on the floor.

On [**2192-6-22**], the patient's family, our senior EEG
attending and representatives from the division of palliative
care met to discuss how to increase her level of comfort in this
end of life situation. The family agreed to adding on PRN
morphine/ativan to help improve her respiratory
distress/tachypnea. At approximately 2200hrs on that evening,
she passed peacefully. The patient had just been visited by her
family just one hour prior. The family was notified by phone and
they refused an autopsy by phone. All the necessary paper work
was completed at the time.
