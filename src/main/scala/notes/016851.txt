Chief Complaint:
acute on chronic renal failure

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 y/o F hx NASH cirrhosis recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] for volume overload and IV diuresis with hospital course
complicated by an UGIB and variceal banding who was discharged
on [**2152-8-19**] to home.
.
She returns today from home having been called in by her
hepatologist for inpatient management of worsening renal
function and increased volume overload. At routine labs drawn
yesterday, her creatinine was 2.5 up from 1.6-1.8 baseline and
she had gained 4 pounds in 2 days. Her weight at last discharge
was 104.5kg.
.
Today, she reports that since discharge she attended her son's
wedding. At the wedding, she reports no dietary indiscretion,
altthough the food was more [**Doctor First Name **] than usual. That night, she
started [**Doctor First Name **] ave nausea, but did not vomit. She also started to
have waterry diarrhea up to 4 times a day on Saturday through
Sunday. On Monday, she felt a bit better, had no diarrhea, but
continued to feel nausea. Tuesday, she had 4 episodes of
diarrhea, nonbloody, non melanic. She did receive zofran from
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] with mild improvement of nausea. Yesterday she was
seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] with routine labs drawn, which were
noted today to have an elevation in creatinine to 2.5 as well as
increase in weight.
.
She denies any fevers, chills, abdomnial pain, cough, pleuritic
pain. + DOE which has not changed from baseline. No CP,
palpitations. No hemetemesis, no melena, BRBPR. Since last EGD,
she has continued to feel a sensation of food stuck in her
throat with swallowing. + worsening heartburn sensations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 62 y/o F hx NASH cirrhosis now s/p TIPS, with
total body overload, acute on chronic kidney disease with
worsening creatinine, and acute hypoxia requiring intubation

During her stay on the liver service, the patient's diuretic
regimen was adjusted but her ascites was felt to be refractory
and on [**8-30**] the patient underwent TIPS, which was complicated by
a small injury to the left portal vein. Despite this however,
the patient's hemoglobin remained stable. Over the next 2 days,
it was noted that the patient's creatinine had increased and
that her urine output had decreased. The patient was found to be
hypoxic to 70% on RA and was also febrile to 101.3F with a new
leukocytosis. Given her respiratory distress and hypoxia, she
was transferred to the MICU for further management.
.
In the MICU, subsequent radiographs (CXR and CT [**9-2**]) showed
moderate pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia with lobar
collapse. She was eventually intubated on [**9-5**] for her
progressive hypoxia and serial radiographs showed massive
pulmonary edema with superimposed multifocal pnuemonia. She was
started on vanc/zosyn/cipro. Bronchoscopy was performed and was
unrevealing. She completed an 8 day course of vanc/zosyn/cipro
but remained febrile throughout until day of d/c on [**9-12**], and by
report remained afebrile thereafter, leading to a working
diagnosis of drug fever in the context of a resolving PNA. Her
renal failure contiuned to worsen, presumably from ATN, and CVVH
was started [**9-7**] through a femoral line, mostly to take off
volume.  She contiuned to require mechanical ventilation until
[**2152-9-13**], when she was successfully extubated. CXR from [**9-14**] s/p
extubation showed marked improvement in pulmonary volume
overload and pleural effusions. Was easily weaned down to 2L NC
with sats in the high 90's. Despite resolution of her hypoxia,
her renal function did not improve and she required HD on [**9-15**].
And was sent to the floor.
