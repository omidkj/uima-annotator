Pertinent Results:
[**2150-8-12**] Echo: Pre bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the [**Month/Day/Year 8813**]
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] stenosis or [**Month/Day/Year 8813**]
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. The
mitral valve leaflets are elongated. There is moderate/severe
bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Post
bypass: Preserved biventricular funciton. Initial regurgiation
secondary to systolic anterior motion of mitral valve resolved
with volume and rate control, no residual MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 35494**] filling.
No MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 86554**] intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All
