History of Present Illness:
55 year old man with PMH of HIV, alcohol abuse, and PCP presents
with fever and diarrhea x 5 days. He reports that he was started
on HAART a few months ago, but had gone on an alcoholic binge
and decided not to take the HAART. Around Patriot's Day he had
some diarrhea which he attributed to HAART. He was very weak
during this period and stopped taking the HAART, after which he
felt significantly better for 2 days. Over the next few days,
the patient has had predominantly diarrhea with only [**12-14**] solid
BM's, subjective fevers and soaking night sweats, mild cough
productive of clear mucus. He is very weak and lethargic. His
friends told him that he looked [**Last Name (LF) 99136**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he called his PCP's
office and came into the ED. [**Hospital1 112**] was on diversion so he came to
[**Hospital1 18**] instead.
.
In the ED, his initial BP was 88/54 and he had a temp of 100.9.
He was given 4L of NS with no improvement of his blood pressure
to 80/45. He received vanc/levo/flagyl and a code sepsis was
called. CT abdomen/pelvis showed no pathology, and CXR showed no
pneumonia. He received another 1L of fluid but CVP was >8 so he
was started on levophed and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: Initially on vanc/levo/flagyl. Stabilized and off
pressors within 12hrs. US with evidence of acute
cholecystitis(?) - added cefepime for broader GM NEG coverage.
On [**4-8**], he spiked to 103.3 and on [**4-9**]: Hemolysis noted on labs
-> marked hemolysis requiring 2 units transfusion overnight. Due
to ongoing temp spikes and hypoxia, cefepime was changed to
meropenem. Heme saw and ruled out TTP-HUS. He also had BMBX for
pancytopenia. MICRO studies sent in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: Cdiff, Blood cultures,
sputum for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1074**] VL, Stool O and P, galactomannin, B glucan.

.
A code purple was called in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior to transfer as
patient wanted to leave. Controlled with Haldol. Upon arrival to
the floor on [**4-19**], he trigerred for hypoxia, tachycardia, had a
fever of 100.8, tremors -> from anxiety. Treated with nebs,
ativan/haldol, bl/urine cx drawn.
.
ROS: Reports that stomach is distended. Has lost 20 pounds over
the last 6 weeks. Fever, chills, sweats, cough, diarrhea (mucus
watery stool) as per HPI. Has some associated abdominal pain
lasting less than 10 seconds, LLQ, crampy while in hospital.
Also has nausea and vomiting. Feels generally ill. Has some SOB
at baseline, variable. Denies chest pain. Hasn't been able to
hold much food down - last time was 2 days PTA, could eat a
little pasta down. Has been able to keep liquids down.

Past Medical History:
HIV, diagnosed in [**2166**], on and off various HAART regimens. Last
CD4 22 in [**11-16**] and VL > 500K
Pneumocystis pneumonia - multiple times (last time over a year
ago)
Alcohol abuse - last drink [**3-27**]
COPD

Social History:
Lives alone. Partnerl died in [**2168**], smokes 1 ppd from 2 ppd for
30 years. Drinks 12+ beers per day when drinking (in binges).
Worked as house painter.

Gen: Appears acutely ill, no respiratory distress, able to give
full history

CV: tachy distant nl s1s2 no M

Pertinent Results:
EKG: NSR at 83, NL axis, no ST/T wave changes. No previous for
comparison.
.
CXR:  Two views of the chest demonstrate clear lungs, normal
cardiac and mediastinal contours, and unremarkable osseous
structures.
IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia.
.
CT Abd:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Splenomegaly.
2.  Diffusely prominent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph
nodes which overall do not meet CT criteria for pathologic
enlargement.
3.  Small amount of free fluid within the abdomen.
4.  Fatty liver.
5.  Equivocal cholelithiasis.
.
RUQ ULTRASOUND to evaluate "equivocal" cholelithiasis as source
of sepsis:
ADDENDUM:  Upon re-evaluation of the son[**Name (NI) 493**] images, as well
as further clinical information, the findings are less
suggestive of acute cholecystitis. The patient has
hypoalbuminemia with an albumin level of 2.8 on [**2180-4-6**] (one day
prior to the ultrasound) and current albumin level of 1.7,
approximately four days later. Gallbladder wall edema and
pericholecystic fluid, as seen on the ultrasound, can be often
seen in patients with hypoalbuminemia. Additionally the
gallbladder is not tense and distended as is usually seen in
cholecystitis. Finally, the patient has a history of HIV and
could be presenting with AIDS related cholangiopathy to account
for his symptoms.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Gallbladder wall edema, most likely secondary to acute
cholecystitis.
2.  Common bile duct is mildly dilated, measuring 7 mm; however,
no stone is seen within the CBD.
3.  The liver demonstrates increased echogenicity with
appearance of fatty
liver; however, other liver disease including cirrhosis and
fibrosis cannot be excluded.
.
MRCP to further evaluate cholecystitis:
1.  Gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid
consistent with
cholecystitis.
2.  No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation or
pancreatic ductal dilatation.
3.  Splenomegaly.
4.  Moderate right pleural effusion and small amount of ascites.

.
ERCP:
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left
hepatic ducts, biliary radicles, cystic duct, and gallbladder
were filled with contrast and well visualized. The course and
caliber of the structures are normal with no evidence of
extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no filling
defects. Normal ERCP to the second part of duodenum.
.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY, for pancytopenia:
1.     Hypercellular, erythroid dominant bone marrow with
megaloblastoid erythropoiesis, left-shifted myelopoiesis, and
megakaryocytic hyperplasia and dysplasia, see note.
Note:  The morphologic changes [megaloblastic erythropoiesis,
dysplasia] are in keeping with a background HIV-related and/or
treatment-related myelopathy. No lymphoma is noted.
2.     Small, non-necrotizing granulomata seen.
Special stain for infectious organisms are pending and will be
reported in an addendum.

BONE MARROW PATH REPORT ADDENDUM:
AFB and GMS stains are negative for acid-fast and fungal
organisms, respectively. Of note, the granulomas were no longer
present on deeper levels obtained for stains. By
immunohistochemistry, stain for [**Date Range 1074**] is negative. CD68 stains
abundant interstitial histiocytes.


Brief Hospital Course:
55yo male with h/o AIDS (CD4 51, VL >100,000), HCV, multiple
episodes of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] initially in shock with presumed
sepsis of biliary source, now with AFB in blood cultures and
stool cultures, likely disseminated MAC

# Disseminated MAC: High suspicion of MAC given constellation of
diarrhea, fevers with night sweats, mesenteric lymphadenopathy,
and pancytopenia with necrotizing granulomata on bone marrow in
an AIDS patient who was not taking MAC prophylaxis. AFB in blood
cultures from [**4-7**] and [**4-9**] and also in stool culture from [**4-12**].
Most likely MAC, less likely TB. Of note, smears of concentrated
sputum samples were negative x3 therefore patient does not have
infectious pulmonary tuberculosis. Started ethambutol 15mg/kg,
rifabutin 150mg every other day (dose adjusted
