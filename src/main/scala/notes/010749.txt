History of Present Illness:
70 M referred for evaluation of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  He
has a history of GERD and [**Doctor Last Name 15532**] esophagus (first diagnosed in
[**2131**]) and underwent a surveillance EGD in [**2133-12-19**] which
demonstrated a focus adenocarcinoma.  He has undergone multiple

[**2134-12-17**]  Pathology

DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Esophagus and proximal stomach, esophagogastrectomy (A-AK):

A.  Esophageal adenocarcinoma; well differentiated, with
invasion into the superficial submucosa (pT1b); see synoptic
report.



B.  Twenty two lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/22).



C.  Single focus of lymphatic invasion identified and confirmed
with D2-40 immunostain (block F).



D.  Resection margins free of carcinoma.

II.  Lymph node, level 7, excision ([**Doctor Last Name **]):

One lymph node with no carcinoma seen (0/1).

III.  Gastric fundus, excision (AM-AN):

Segment of gastric fundus, within normal limits; no carcinoma
seen.

IV:  Esophagus, "donut", excision (AO-AP):

Unremarkable segment of squamous-lined esophagus; no carcinoma
seen.

V.  Stomach, "donut", excision (AQ):

Unremarkable fundic mucosa/submucosa; no carcinoma seen.

[**2134-12-19**] CXR ;
1) Compared with earlier the same day, improvement in CHF
findings and in the right pleural effusion.
2) Patchy opacities throughout the right lung slightly improved,
but
persistent.
3) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left
effusion
unchanged

[**2134-12-24**] CXR :
1. Moderate right and small left pleural effusion unchanged.
2. Stable post-operative widening of the mediastinum due to
fluid filling the neoesophagus.
3. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged.
4. No pneumothorax.
5. Heart size normal

[**2134-12-27**] Cardiac echo :
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9035**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a minimally invasive
esophagogastrectomy.  He tolerated the procedure well and
returned to the SICU in stable condition.  He required
reintubation for hypercarbia but was easily extubated on post op
day #1. He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was
controlled with an epidural catheter.

During his ICU stay he developed rapid atrial fibrillation and
was started on Lopressor and amiodarone which eventually
controlled his rate.  He had low grade fevers and a leukocytosis
to 14.7K with chest xray findings of bibasilar opacities.  He
was started on Vanco and Zosyn prophylactically but sputum
culture grew only a sparse growth of GNR's. He continued to
progress daily and was started of cyclic tube feedings on
[**2134-12-20**].  Unfortunately his blood sugars were not controlled and
the [**Last Name (un) **] service was consulted to help with insulin
recommendations as pre operatively he was managed with Metformin
alone.  He was started on Lantus along with sliding scale
regular insulin and with gradual adjustments came into better
control.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor his nasogastric tube
was removed and he had a barium swallow on post op day # 8 which
revealed no leak.  He was also evaluated by the Cardiology
service as he had persistent bouts of atrial fibrillation
sometimes as high as 140 but was asymptomatic.  His Amiodarone
dose was increased to TID and anticoagulation was recommended
with baby aspirin daily along with Coumadin as his [**Country **] score
was 3. His PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was out of town but his office
staff was very helpful in reviewing his past history as there
was a question of a GI bleed on aspirin in [**2131**]. Our
cardiologist recommendations remained the same pending review by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows Mr. [**Known lastname 9035**] very well. On [**2133-12-28**] his
Amiodarone was decreased to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month then 200 mg
daily.
