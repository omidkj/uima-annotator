Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective admission for left temporal lobectomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L craniotomy for resection of mass
L Temporal lobectomy

History of Present Illness:
81M with hx of left parotid cancer treated with radiation in
[**2178**]
who now presents with increased confusion and concern for
progression of radiation necrosis. In [**2182**], the patient had an
MRI that showed a left temporal lobe lesion. This was felt to be
most consistent with radiation necrosis on review by Neuro here
at [**Hospital1 18**] and the patient was started on steroids at that time.
He
had improvement and had no further issues until recently his
family noted new behavioral changes. The family noticed the
confusion 1 year ago with occasional combativeness. However, the
patient was still able to be very independent, including
driving.
He had been seen by his PCP and Neurologist over this past year
who started him on anti-depressant medications (initially
citalopram, then switched to fluoxetine). 2 months ago, the
patient had a more rapid decline with respect to confusion and
behavior and family stopped letting him drive. He was seen back
in [**Hospital **] clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] on [**11-24**] - he recommended
repeat imaging with PET-CT and MRI. The repeat MRI showed a new
complex [**Month/Day (1) 6279**] mass in the temporal lobe with the read saying
most consistent with persistent radiation necrosis. He was
started on high dose steroids at that time with dexamethasone
12mg daily although became quite combative at that dose. His
dose
was then tapered to 4mg which helped with the combativeness
however he was still very confused and weak and was admitted by
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] for further workup. While in house he was started on
insulin and ultimately discharged home with plans for follow-up
with us.

Today he presents to the clinic to discuss possible surgical
intervention. Since discharge he has had issues with his blood
sugars and also had a fall on New Years Eve after which he had a
laceration on his right eye brow requiring stitches.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2189-12-29**]
1.Immediately status post left temporparietal craniotomy and
resection of
[**Year/Month/Day 6279**] mass in the left temporal lobe, with expected
post-surgical change
2. Hyperdensity in the extra-axial space overlying the left
frontal lobe,
new, likely small subdural hemorrhage.
3. Extensive vasogenic edema with leftward shift of
normally-midline
structures, slightly more pronounced compared to the [**2189-12-16**]
examination

MRI Brain with and without contrast [**2189-12-30**]:
FINDINGS: The patient is status post left temporoparietal
craniotomy with
expected post-surgical changes in the form of pneumocephalus,
left frontal
extra-axial fluid collection (measuring 6 mm in maximal
thickness) and large fluid-filled resection cavity at the tip of
the left temporal lobe with sedimentation and fluid-fluid level.
A considerable amount of blood product is lining the posterior
and medial aspect of the resection cavity.  Enhancement is noted
along the dura and is likely reactive in nature. On
diffusion-weighted images, there is gyriform hyperintensity on
the DWI (images # 12,13,14, series #9), involving the posterior
aspect of the resection cavity and extending along the primary
auditory associative cortex, concerning for acute/subacute areas
of ischemia.

The previously reported vasogenic edema, involving the left
temporal and the left parietal lobe is unchanged, there is
stable mass effect with distortion of the lateral ventricles,
compression of the left cerebral peduncle and midline shift.

Flow voids of the major intracranial vessels are preserved. The
paranasal
sinuses are clear. Opacification of the left mastoid air cell is
largely
unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post resection of right temporal lesion with
postoperative changes in the form of dural enhancement
extra-axial fluid (6 mm in maximal thickness), pneumocephalus,
and moderate hemorrhage at the resection site.

2. Gyriform hyperintensity on the DWI (images # 12,13,14, series
#9),
involving the posterior aspect of the resection cavity and
extending along the primary auditory associative cortex,
concerning for acute/subacute areas of ischemia.

Head CT w/o contrast [**2189-12-31**]:
FINDINGS: Status post left temporoparietal craniotomy, resection
of the left temporal complex lesion with persistent extensive
vasogenic edema with effacement of the left lateral ventricle.
However, there is a new large hemorrhage in the resection site
spanning over area of 5.5 x 4.7 cm. There is also increase in
the subdural hemorrhage along the falx (2:17) and tracking along
the left convexity. There is increase in the rightward shift of
midline structures from 4.5-8 mm in keeping with increased mass
effect from the new hemorrhage. There are
