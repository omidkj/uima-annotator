Chief Complaint:
s/p VFib arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
62 year-old male with history of HTN and hyperlipidemia who
presents from OSH after VFib arrest. He presented to [**Hospital1 6591**] yesterday evening with 10/10 chest and epigastric pain
and bilateral arm discomfort. He was admitted to the floor for
serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs. At 4:30 am he developed VFib
arrest x 3 minutes, shocked x 1 @ 120J, and intubated. EKG
reportedly showed evidence of IMI. He received lovenox,
integrillin bolus, ?plavix.
.
In the cath lab he was found to have diffuse mild CAD with
severe single vessel disease. He underwent BMS to OM.
.
Review of systems is unable to be obtained due to patient being
intubated. Per his family, he had only 1 day of symptoms, nou
cough/fever/chills, no pleurisy. Per OSH records, he was given
influenza vaccine, refused Pneumovax.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for tube placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old man s/p inf MI and VFib arrest now intubated.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for tube placement
HISTORY: Cardiac surgery with intubation.

FINDINGS: No previous images. Endotracheal tube tip lies about 4
cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the distal
stomach. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal
in size. No evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion,
or acute pneumonia at this time.

Sinus rhythm. ST-T wave flattening in leads I and aVL. Biphasic
to inverted
T waves in leads V5-V6. These findings are consistent with
lateral ischemic
process. No previous tracing available for comparison. Followup
and clinical
correlation are suggested.

Cardiac Catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was without
angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD had a diffuse
disease with a
mid vessel 30% lesion.  The LCX had a thrombotic, 90% occluded
high OM1.
The RCA was a small, non-dominant vessel with no
angiographically
apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial
hypertension of 141/83 mm Hg.
3. Successful stenting of the thrombotic OM1 with 3.0 X 23 mm
Driver
bare metal stent with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments
for
detail).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute PTCA
of
OM1 vessel.
3. Successful stenting of the OM1 with bare metal stent.

.
Cardiac Echo (post-Cath)
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with distal septal and apical hypokinesis
(?distal LAD distribution). The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the CCU for management s/p BMS to OM1 on
admission.
.
#CAD: Patient was monitored on telemetry in the CCU and was
without significant ectopy.  Impression was for V. Fib arrest in
the setting of ischemia, and further work-up for ICD was
deferred.  Patient was maintained on beta-blocker, aspirin,
plavix while in the CCU.  ACE was titrated up without
difficulty.  Echo demonstrated a low normal EF (50-55%) with
distal and septal hypokinesis but without other focal wall
motion abnormalities.
.
#HTN: BP was controlled post-MI with ACE and beta-blocker.
Patient reported a history of hypertension requiring multiple
agents to control BP.  During hospital stay, patient's BP was
controlled with above.
.
#Pulm: Patient was intubated on arrival to CCU.  ABG
demonstrated good respiratory status and patient's sedation was
weaned.  Underlying mental status was intact, and patient was
extubated w/o difficulty.  Rapidly weaned to nasal cannula, and
later room air without difficulty.
.
#Depression: Patient was restarted on at home medications.
.
Remainder of hospital stay was uneventful.

Discharge Condition:
Good.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to an outside hospital for evaluation of
bilateral arm pain.  While in the hospital you suffered a heart
attack (or Acute Cronary Syndrome) that likely caused your heart
to go into an abnormal heart rhythm known as ventricular
fibrillation.  You were then transferred to this hospital where
a stent was placed into one of your coronary arteries to
reestablish blood flow to the heart.  An echocardiogram after
this procedure demonstrated that you have mildly reduced
function of your heart.
.
Upon leaving the hospital, please take all medications as
directed, and follow-up as directed.  If you experience any
chest pain or shortness of breath please do not hesitate to
contact your doctor or return to the Emergency Department.
