HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old
female, with extensive tobacco history; rheumatic heart
disease with severe mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
She was admitted for presurgery catheterization which showed
elevated pulmonary artery pressures.  She was subsequently
transferred to the CCU for Swan-Ganz monitoring, diuresis to
decrease PA pressures prior to MVR surgery.

The patient's symptoms started in [**2188**] when she was
hospitalized in [**Hospital1 1474**] for shortness of breath and new
onset congestive heart failure.  Echocardiogram at that time
revealed mild to moderate mitral stenosis, moderate to severe
mitral regurgitation with good left ventricular function.

Stress test with nuclear imaging showed mild to moderate
reversible anterolateral perfusion defects.  The patient was
started on medical therapy and referred to [**Hospital1 346**] for catheterization.
Catheterization in [**2189-9-13**] showed increase PA
pressures.  Mitral valve gradient in an area of 1.6.  3 to 4+
mitral regurgitation.

The patient had been managed on medical therapy over the past
year and noticed worsening dyspnea on exertion (from house to
her car) and occasional two pillow orthopnea.  She denies
chest pain, palpitations, lower extremity edema, abdominal
pain.  The patient was admitted today for a mitral valve
replacement, preoperative catheterization which demonstrated
severely elevated PA pressures, with an elevated PA systolic
of 115 and wedge of 39 to 40; decreased mitral valve area to
0.8.  The patient received 40 of intravenous Lasix in the
catheterization laboratory.  She was transferred to the CCU
for Swan-Ganz placement and diuresis management to decrease
PA pressures.  On the floor, she seemed hemodynamically
stable. Swan was placed with a RA pressure of 6, PA pressure
systolic 89 and diastolic 38.  Pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 25.  On arrival to the CCU, the patient was
started on Nitroprusside and Lasix intravenous 40 times one.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis. [**2192-9-12**] echo shows 3+ mitral regurgitation; severe pulmonary
hypertension; mean gradient of 22, peak 38; MV area of 1.1 cm
squared; ejection fraction of 60% with left ventricular
hypertrophy.
2.  Coronary artery disease risk factors:  Age, positive
tobacco use for 50 pack years, quit in [**2192-9-12**].
Otherwise, she denies hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
diabetes or any family history.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Combivent two puffs twice a day.
2.  Lorazepam 0.5 mg prn.
3.  Lasix 40 mg twice a day.
4.  Potassium chloride equivalent of supplements 10 meq p.o.
q. day.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband in
[**Name (NI) 1474**].  She has four children.  She worked in sales and is
now retired.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Heart rate of 73; blood pressure of
119/56; 99% on two liters nasal cannula.  In general, the
patient is anxious, cooperative, lying flat in bed, in no
apparent distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  JVP
about 5 cm above the costal margin.  Carotids 2+ with no
bruits.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm with normal
S1 and S2. Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, obese with good bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Right groin with no oozing, hematoma or bruit.
+2 dorsalis pedis pulses present bilaterally.  Neurologic:
Alert and oriented times three; appropriate with facial
symmetry.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 10.4; hematocrit
of 38.9; platelets 317.  Sodium of 145; potassium of 3.2;
chloride 109; bicarbonate 23; BUN 17; creatinine 0.7; glucose
99; ALT 16; AST 19; alkaline phosphatase 107.  Arterial blood
gases prior to oxygen was 7.44/36/51.  Amylase was 44.  Total
bilirubin was 1.0.

Electrocardiogram on [**2192-12-26**] shows normal sinus
rhythm.

Catheterization from [**2193-1-31**], final report:  Right atrium 9;
RV 114/13; [**MD Number(3) 32836**]/45 with a mean PAP of 68.  Pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 32.  Cardiac output of 4.0.
Cardiac index of 1.9.  SBR of 20 and 20.  MB gradient 21.  MV
area of 0.8.  Coronary catheterization otherwise was with
clean coronaries except for obtuse marginal one which showed
20% mid vessel stenosis but otherwise, no evidence of
thrombosis in the coronary arteries.

Echocardiogram:  ([**2192-9-17**])  Normal left ventricular function
with an ejection fraction of 50%; left ventricular
hypertrophy; severe calcified mitral stenosis with gradient
of 22; MHEA area of 1.1 cm squared.  Peak 38.  3+ mitral
regurgitation.  Severe pulmonary hypertension.  Estimated PA
systolic of 80.  Left atrial enlargement.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 62 year old female with extensive
tobacco history and rheumatic heart disease with severe
mitral stenosis, valve area of 0.8 and 3 to 4+ mitral
regurgitation.  Elevated filling pressures of pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 35 with a PA mean of 70.
Admitted to the CCU for medical therapy and diuresis, to
decrease her filling pressures prior to MVR.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac:  Coronary artery disease.  The patient had
minimal to no coronary artery disease on catheterization on
[**1-31**] prior to admission.  She has no history of angina or
ischemia symptoms.  She was continued on her aspirin.  She
was also started on a statin.

Valvular:  The patient has severe mitral stenosis and mitral
regurgitation with a small valve area on most recent
catheterization.  The patient was admitted for diuresis and
medical management to decrease filling pressures, due to
possible mitral valve replacement.  She was started on a
trial of Lasix and Nipride with a goal PA systolic of 60 and
a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure goal of 15.  The patient
diuresed well with Nipride and Lasix drip.  Natrecor was
considered but was found to be unnecessary since the patient
was diuresing well with her Nipride an Lasix drip.
Ultimately, her pulmonary artery pressures were less than 60
and her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure did decrease to
below 15.  After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] of
cardiothoracic surgery, and in view of other hospital
complications such as fever and patient's overall high
surgical risk, it was decided that the patient should not
proceed to surgery now, given the high risk.  The patient was
started on Lasix p.o. regimen of 80 mg p.o. three times a day
on [**2-12**] and diuresed quite significantly with diuresis of
negative 1.8 liters on that day.  Her creatinine bumped to
1.5.  Considering this bump in creatinine and very negative
fluid balance, the patient's Lasix regimen was decreased to
40 mg p.o. twice a day and her urine output was continued to
be monitored.  It was decided that the patient should
continue on this regimen as an outpatient, as well as on
Norvasc at 5 mg p.o. q. day.  Further discussion of a mitral
valve replacement could be discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] in
the future.

Rhythm:  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm with
occasional premature atrial contractions.  She had no
significant ectopy on telemetry or no electrocardiogram
changes.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient has extensive tobacco history and
was hospitalized for pulmonary edema in the past.  She
continued to maintain good oxygen saturations on a shovel
mask, mostly because she did not prefer to use the nasal
cannula.  On transfer to the [**Hospital1 **] for out of the unit, the
patient remained having high oxygen saturations of 98 to 99%
on six liters nasal cannula and her oxygen can continue to be
weaned down as an outpatient.  She has maintained good oxygen
saturations and her arterial blood gases were improved prior
to transfer from the floor.  She should continue on her
Combivent inhaler as an outpatient.  She has maintained good
oxygen saturations and her arterial blood gases were improved
prior to transfer from the floor.  She should continue on her
Combivent inhaler as an outpatient.

Of note, given her pulmonary hyper
