Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary catheterization with Percutaneous Coronary Intervetion
to proximal left anterior descending artery with placement of
Drug Eluding Stent in the middle left anterior descending

History of Present Illness:
66 y/o M hx of HPL, and MI [**2145**] with 90% stenosis of mid-RCA s/p
BMS and [**2149**] rheolytic thrombectomy and 90% mid-LAD stenosis s/p
DES to LAD who presented to the ED after sudden onset of chest
pressure this am while working in his yard.  His symptoms were
typical of prior episodes when he was having a MI.  He was
sweating profusely and have crushing, non-radiating chest pain.
He says that over the last few weeks he was getting more
fatigued with activities he was usually able to do with [**Last Name **]
problem.  [**Name (NI) **] his wife, with the onset of the chest pressure, he
started sweating more than usual and they knew he was having a
heart attack.  He stated that he tried a SL nitro with no
relief, but his prescription was 1 year old.  Per his wife he
also appeared to lose consciousness for a few minutes while in
the car, but was arousable.  He was taken by truck back to the
house and EMS was called, an EKG was notable for ST elevations
and a code STEMI was called.

He was taken directly to the cath lab where had systolic BPs
ranging from 80-96/50-60s, he recieved 210 cc contrast, was
loaded with Plavix 600mg, and started on heparin drip.  LHC via
the right radial artery revealed 100% occlusion of the mid-LAD
within the prior stent.  This was stented with a DES.  In
addition, there was a 80% stenosis of the origin of the diagonal
branch within the LAD stent.  There was a 3 mm segment of
intraluminal filling defect 15 mm distal to the stent likely
representing embolized thrombus and patient was started on
integrilin drip.

Vitals on transfer were 93/66 90 42 92% on 3L.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient stable, he had complaints of
residual chest discomfort with exhalation, but much improved.
He described is "when you just had a headache and it goes a way,
you know you had a headache not too long ago".  Otherwise he had
no c/o SOB, cough, arm, neck or jaw pain.  Denies f/c, n/v,
abdominal pain, LE edema.

STUDIES:
([**2160-7-26**]) CXR:  In comparison with the study of [**7-26**], there is
little overall change.  Cardiac silhouette remains within normal
limits.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect
some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  No acute focal
pneumonia or pleural effusion
.
.
([**2160-7-26**]) CATH: ASSESSMENT
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
.
LMCA:  Normal
.
LAD:    100% occlusion of the mid LAD within the prior stent.
There was a 80% stenosis of the origin of the diagonal branch
within the LAD stent.  The distal LAD was a large disbtribution
vessel that supplied the apex.  There were small 2nd and 3rd
diagonal branches that supplied the anterolateral wall.
.
LCX:    The proximal and distal LCx had minimal lumen
irregularities.  Threw was a large OMB that supplied the
posterolater wall.  It was free of significant disease.
.
RCA:    The RCA stent was widely patent.  The was a 50% margin
stenosis distal to the stent that supplied a large PDA branch
and medium size posterolateral branches.
.
Interventional details
.
The indication for the procedure was an anterior STEMI.
.
The procedure was performed from the right radial artery without
complications
.
Unfractionated heparin was used to achieve an ACT > 250 seconds.
Eptifibatide was given as a double bolus.
.
Using a 6Fr XB3.5 guiding catheter and a 0.014 OTW BMW wire, the
LAD was dilated with a 2.5 mm balloon.  There was lesion
rigidity in the distal portion of  then stent and a 2.75 mm x 12
mm Apex NC balloon was used to fully expand the stent.   A 2.0
mm balloon was used to dilated the diagonal branch prior to
additional stent implantation.    A 2.75 mm x 14 mm Resolute
drug eluting stent was then deployed within the stent and was
post dilated with a 3.0 mm balloon to 22 atms pressure.  This
resulted in no residual stenosis within the stent and TIMI 3
flow into the distal vessel.
.
There was a 50-60% stenosis of the origin of the diagonal branch
but TIMI 3 flow into the distal vessel.
.
There was a 3 mm segment of intraluminal filling defect 15 mm
distal to the stent that likely represented embolized thrombus.
It was laminar and seen in the [**Doctor Last Name **] but not the LAO projections.
It will be treated with continued antiplatelet therapy and
GPIIB-IIIa antagonists for 18 hours.   Consideration for long
term anticoagulation with warfarin with evidence of an LV
aneurysm.
.
The patient was painfree at the end of the procedure, but the
EKG showed improved but persistent ST elevation in the anterior
precordial leads.
.
ASSESSMENT
1.	Anterior ST elevation due to LAD stent occlusion
2.	Successful drug-eluting stent of the mid LAD
PLAN
1.	Aspirin 325 mg daily for one month then 81 mg daily
thereafter
2.	Plavix 75 mg daily
3.	Eptifibatide infusion x 18 hours
4.	Echocardiogram for LV akinesis: consider anti-coagulation
