Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheal Obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
38 y/o male with PMHx significant for type 1 diabetes, history
of jail time, who initially presented at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with 10
days of chest tightness, mylagias, couging, fever, and wheezing,
as well as shortness of breath. At OSH patient was being treated
for CAP and started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone. Patient had
CXR done at OSH which showed diffuse reticular nodular opacities
involving bilateral lungs. CT chest at OSH was reported to show
diffuse ground glass opacification and diffuse adenopathy. There
was also adenopathy that was compressing the trachea, given this
concern for airway obstruction patient was intubated and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. He was ruled out
for MI with negative CEx3 and negative EKG

CT chest [**6-6**]:
FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube is in place, with tip terminating
just above the level of the aortic arch. The trachea is abnormal
in size and contour. The trachea is enlarged with coronal
diameter of 2.8 cm. Additionally, it has a lunate configuration
with elevated coronal to sagittal ratio. During expiration,
there is excessive collapsibility of the tracheal lumen,
resulting in reduction of cross-sectional area from 149 mm2 to
53 mm2. This likely underestimates the degree of collapsibility
because it was not performed as a dynamic expiratory scan.
Dense consolidation is present throughout both lower lobes with
homogeneous increased density with prominent air bronchograms.
More heterogeneous lung opacities are present within the
anterior, nondependent portions of the lungs, including the
upper lobes, middle lobe and lingula. These areas demonstrate
peribronchiolar ground-glass opacities, areas of consolidation,
and centrilobular/tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities.
Enlarged lymph nodes are present within the mediastinum,
measuring up to 13 mm within the right paratracheal and
precarinal regions. Additionally, there is diffuse stranding
throughout the mediastinal fat, likely due to edema. The heart
size is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is a trace
amount of ascites. The remaining imaged portion of the upper
abdomen is unremarkable on this unenhanced CT which was not
specifically tailored to evaluate the abdominal organs. Diffuse
anasarca is present throughout the chest and abdominal wall soft
tissues.
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged, lunate trachea configuration with associated
tracheomalacia. Severity of tracheomalacia is likely
underestimated on this end-expiratory scanning sequence.
2. Diffuse bilateral lung parenchymal abnormalities, including
peribronchiolar opacities in the upper and mid lungs and
extensive confluent consolidation in the lower lobes. The
findings are most consistent with diffuse infection complicated
by ARDS. A component of hydrostatic edema is also possible,
particularly given the presence of diffuse anasarca and
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
echo [**6-6**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal; there
are echolucent areas in the basal and midventricular segments of
the right ventricular free wall; the apical segment of the right
ventricular free wall appears thin. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Impression: status post cardiac arrest; dilated hypocontractile
right
ventricle; consider arrhythmogenic right ventricular
cardiomyopathy
.
CTA [**6-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Redemonstration of multifocal parenchymal opacities. Some of
the right lung opacities appear to have progressed, while others
in the left upper lobe, appear slightly better than on [**2182-6-6**].
3. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation, unchanged. Unchanged
bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Severe tracheobronchomalacia. Suggestion of bronchiectasis in
multiple areas, difficult to assess given the presence of
intubation/positive-pressure ventilation.
.

TTE [**6-18**]:
 No evidence for intracardiac (right-to-left) shunt identified.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2182-7-1**] 11:11 AM
Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable and there is no evidence of
free air on this portable film. Possible nlargement of the liver
silhouette may represent hepatomegaly or a prominent Riedel's
lobe. Surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ileus or obstruction.
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-7-2**] 12:45 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-26**] through 9.
Small bilateral pleural effusion has increased, with new
fissural components. Atelectasis or consolidation at the left
base has improved since [**6-29**] and atelectasis at the right lung
base, which has been difficult to assess all along appears to
have improved, restricted to the posterior basal segment. Heart
size is normal. No pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube and right
subclavian line in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-7-6**] 2:35 PM
There is dense collapse and consolidation of the dependent
aspects of both lung bases, right greater than left. There is
minimal improvement in the aeration of the left lower lobe.
Patchy nodular airspace opacification is again noted involving
the right upper lobe, left upper lobe and the aerated portions
of the left lower lobe. This has not significantly changed from
the prior examination. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
again noted which have slightly improved from the prior
examination. As previously described there is evidence of
tracheomalacia. A tracheostomy tube appears in the mid trachea.
No pericardial effusion is present.
Limited unenhanced images through the upper abdomen are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Dense collapse and consolidation of lung bases eith
minimal improvement in the aeration of the left lower lobe.
Patchy nodular airspace disease throughouth the lungs relatively
unchanged consistentwith multilobar pneumonia and ARDS.
.
[**2182-7-10**] 9:47 AM
CHEST, UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE: Comparison is made to five days
earlier and to a more recent CT from [**2182-7-6**]. Patient is
status post tracheostomy. A PICC line terminates at the
cavoatrial junction. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
unremarkable. There are no effusions or pneumothorax. Patchy
bilateral alveolar opacities are somewhat more extensive than
before.
IMPRESSION: Worsen
