History of Present Illness:
88 year old Female with Alzheimer's dementia, Atrial
Fibrillation, moderate malnutrition, transferred from [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital for emergent ERCP for presumed gallstone pancreatitis
and septic shock.  The patient was at her nursing home when she
was noted to have an episode of vomiting of large amount of
undigested food at 2 AM on [**2187-9-21**].  She then vomited a large
amount of brown liquid that was reportedly hemocult positive.
The nursing home physician was made aware and referred to ED.
The patient's oxygen saturation was noted to be 85-88% on room
air and 2L of oxygen via NC brought her saturation to 92%.

At [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital ED, VS: BP 129/68  P 83  R 18  Temp 100.3
O2 sat 93% on RA. EKG reported to have sinus rhythm with ST
depressions in V3-V6 consistent with digoxin artifact without
comparison.  The patient was given Flagyl 500 mg IV x 1 and
Levaquin 500 mg IV x 1.  An ultrasound of the abdomen there
reportedly showed cholelithiasis, a slightly enlarged CBD, and
pancreatic inflammation.  Thought to have gallstone pancreatitis
and would need an ERCP, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 **].

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her vitals were T 98.9  BP 99/62  HR 101  RR 19  O2
sat 93% 2L NC
2 L NS given.  Flagyl 500 mg IV x 1, Vancomycin 1 gram IV x 1,
and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV x 1 were given.  RUQ ultrasound, CXR, and
CT abdomen with contrast were performed. her urinalysis was
noted positive for infection.  Urgent ERCP consult was obtained
with a plan to continue IV fluids and IV antibiotics.  She was
noted hypotensive in the ED, and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.

A conservative approach to the cholangitis was followed given
her comorbitidities and her response to fluids and antibiotics.
She was also noted with a pneumonia. She was continued on
Vancomycin, along with levaquin and flagyl. After stabilizing,
she was transferred to the medical floor.

She subsequently defervesced, and slowly improved to baseline.
After being afebrile for 48 hours, she was stable to return to
her [**Hospital1 1501**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis/biliary sludge. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] findings to
suggest acute
cholecystitis.
2. Mild right-sided calyectasis without hydronephrosis.


CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2187-9-21**] 9:27 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2187-9-21**] 11:14 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderately distended gallbladder without any intrahepatic
ductal
dilatation and mild prominence of the extrahepatic CBD which
measures 10 mm. No focal filling defects were identified;
however, CT is insensitive for detection of choledocholithiasis.

2. Peri-inflammatory changes and free fluid within the abdomen
consistent
with acute pancreatitis. No regions of pancreatic necrosis
identified.

bronchiolitis
within the right lower lobe in this patient with a complete
mucoid impaction of the lower lobe bronchi bilaterally.
4. Incompletely characterized small hypoattenuating right
hepatic and right renal lesions, likely benign cysts, but too
small to definitively
characterize.
5. Extensive mitral annular calcification and atherosclerotic
disease within the coronary vessel and aorta.
