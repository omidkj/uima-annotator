History of Present Illness:
63 you M with PMHx of COPD on home O2, Hep C, hx of aflutter 5
yrs ago who presents with cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat since
[**Holiday **]. Over the past 2 weeks, he c/o fevers to 101 (3d ago),
chills, myalgias, increasing productive cough, increasing SOB.
She states he gets bronchitis qyr and got the flu vaccine this
yr. He also c/o diarrhea x 2 weeks for which he took immodium
and his diarrhea subsequently stopped [**3-15**] d ago. He went to his
PCP where CXR showed PNA and he was given
combivent/albuterol/solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1. He had OSH labs
which were significant for BNP of 77.1. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Here, his initial temp was 99.5 with O2
sat of 79% on RA. He was started on 100% NRB and was noted to
have increased lethargy. He was then given 40 IV lasix (unclear
reasons), [**Name (NI) **], CTX 1g iv x 1, albuterol nebs and ABG showed
7.27/95/140. Thus started on CPAP 10/5/0.6 and given 0.5 mg IV
ativan and now MICU consulted. Intubated [**12-24**] for hypercarbic
respiratory failure (7.26/103/66/48).

Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o man with severe COPD and LLQ pneumonia admitted to MICU
for hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
Hospital course outlined by problem [**Name (NI) 101314**]:

## RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology due to LLL pneumonia with COPD
exacerbation.  He was started on CPAP with little benefit and
required intubation for worsening hypercapnia, respiratory
distress, and somnolence.  He was continued on IV steroids then
transitioned to a PO steroid taper.  Sedation was accomplished
with midaz and fentanyl drip.  He was started on azithromycin
and ceftrizxone for coverage of community acquired oragansims,
however when he failed to improve, he was transitioned to
levaquin and ceftriaxone for more appropriate coverage of a
possible pseudomonas nosocomial pneumonia.  Sputum cultures grew
oral flora and on one occasion Neiseria meningitis.  He is a
carrier for N. meningitis which does not warrant treatment,
however the ceftrizxone would cover this organism.  His MICU
course was complicated by a brief episode of hypotension that
was felt to be related to hypovolemia (increased insensible
losses from respiratory distress) and not felt to be related to
sepsis.  He was volume resuscitated with good results and
required a total of 7 liters IVF in the MICU.  He was extubated
on [**2128-12-30**] with a postextubation ABG of 7.38/72/81 with a
HCO3=40.  O2 sats were 91-95% on 3 liters n/c.  He is a CO2
retainer and should be kept at O2 sats of 90-94%.  Standing
atrovent and albuterol nebulizers and fluticasone were
continued.  Echo showed evidence of RV failure in the absence of
LV failure consistent with cor pulmonale from his COPD.  He was
encouraged to continue his effort toward smoking cessation. He
was d/c on nicotine replacment therapy (patch).  HE WILL NEED A
TOTAL OF 4 MORE DAYS OF PREDNISONE FOR HIS RAPID TAPER.  He was
started on Tiotropium and after 24 hours of loading the drug,
his Atrovent was stopped.  His Advair was increased to 500/50 1
puff [**Hospital1 **].
     Unfortunately at the end of his stay, he was exposed to a
roomate who tested positive for INFLUENZA A.  Given his poor
pulmonary reserve, he was started on prophylactic amantadine
100mg [**Hospital1 **] x10days.  Nasopharyngeal aspirate was performed; the
results of his DFA and viral cultures are pending and will need
to be followed up by his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7470**] if
he develops any flu-like symptoms.

##CAD: The patient had no active coronary ischemia, however his
EKG was notable for inferior Q waves suggestive of a prior
inferior wall MI.  Transthoracic echo did not show an inferior
wall motion abnormality however the study was of suboptimal
quality.  He was started on an ACEI and aspirin.  He was
continued on a statin.  He is taking a CCB for rate control of
a-flutter, however he is not taking an beta blocker.  This
should be considered once his COPD is back to baseline for
secondary prevention of ACS and decreased mortality benefit.  It
is suggested that he be started on a
