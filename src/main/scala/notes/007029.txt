Imaging:
[**2-2**]: MRI C-spine: 1. Large prevertebral hematoma is seen as on
the previous CT. The cervical spine findings do not explain the
presence of hematoma and further evaluation with CT angiography
is recommended to exclude [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] trauma. 2. Mild buckling of
the ligamentum flavum at C5-6 without disruption. Otherwise, no
evidence of abnormal signal within the ligaments of vertebral
bodies to indicate significant cervical spine trauma. 3. No
evidence of compression of the spinal cord or abnormal signal
within the spinal cord. 4. Slightly limited study due to motion.

CTA neck: Proximal cervical R ICA demonstrates medial focal
outpouching of 10 x 6 mm suggesting traumatic psuedoaneurysm,
with 8 mm neck. Large prevertebral hematoma again seen. No
fracture.

[**2165-2-2**]
MR:There is no evidence of acute/subacute ischemic changes.
Small
punctate focus of high signal intensity identified at the
subcortical white matter on the right cerebral hemisphere,
possibly related with a small gliotic focus.
2. The signal artifact identified at the left frontal region,
possibly is related with a punctate metal foreign body.
3. Mild prominence of the sulci is identified at the frontal
region
bilaterally.
4. Patchy bilateral ethmoidal mucosal thickening, mild mucosal
thickening on the right maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening
at the sphenoid sinus with a small amount of air-fluid level on
the left.
-spine: Anterior and lateral subluxation of the right superior
C2 /articular process with respect to the inferior C1 articular
facet. Extensive prevertebral soft tissue edema. Possible
subluxation of the C3-C4 right uncovertebral articulation.
Recommend MRI to evaluate for ligamentous injury.
CT head: no ICH
Ct abd: Collapse of left lower lobe basal segments, no ptx. ??
left 7th anterior nondisplaced rib fracture. Grade I splenic
laceration and grade I liver laceration with trace
hemoperitoneum adjacent to lacerations. Increase in small amount
of perisplenic hematoma on 1 hr delay sequence.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service and transferred to the ICU
for close monitoring. He was observed with serial hematocrits
and abdominal exams for his splenic and live lacerations.

The [**Month/Day/Year **] surgery service was consulted regarding his carotid
pseudoaneurysm, and recommended carotid dopplers and
conservative management.

Neurosurgery was consulted regarding his C2/C3 subluxation,
which turned out to be an old injury, and recommended
conservative therapy and cleared his C-spine.

On hospital day 3 he was noted with persistently decreasing
hematocrit levels, so he underwent splenectomy. Under the same
anesthesia, he had ORIF of his ankle fracture and closure of the
leg wound by orthopedic surgery. Lovenox is being recommended
for DVT prophylaxis. He was transfused 2 units of PRBCs and
transferred to the floor in stable condition.

On the floor he continued to improve post-operatively.  His
hematocrit levels remained stable.  His diet was advanced, and
he was switched from a Dilaudid PCA to oral pain medications
with adequate pain control. His splenectomy vaccinations were
given just before discharge.

He was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
