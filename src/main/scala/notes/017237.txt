History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] is a 64 year-old man with a history of esophageal
cancer, s/p resection, neoesophagus, radiation, and chemotherapy
who presents with GIB.
.
Most recently admitted [**Date range (1) 22630**] with dyspnea and suboptimal
stress test.  Cardiac catheterization revealed moderate MR and
two vessel CAD.  He underwent a pericardectomy  only as he had
severe constrictive pericarditis related to his esophageal
radiation.
.

began to vomit blood.  No nausea or vomiting before initial
hemetemesis.  Over the evening he vomited ~5 times, once with
"jellyfish" appearance.  Also with concurrent black stools (~5).
 Last episode of hemetemesis was at 7am on day of admission.
.
Initially presented to an OSH where BP was 109/68 with HR 129.
HCT found to ve 22.1.  2 units of pRBC were given.
.
In the ED, initial BP 116/79 with HR 120, RR 20 and 100% on room
air.  BP fell to as low as 95/70 with HR in the 120s.  Recieved
1+ liters of IVF.
.

weight
(+) fatigue
(-) fevers/chills

Studies:
[**2133-3-25**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Increased right-sided pleural effusion
and possible infiltrate in the right lower lung. Interval
decrease in left-sided pleural effusion compared to [**2133-3-12**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
[**2133-3-25**] Endoscopy -
Findings: Esophagus:
 Lumen: Evidence of a previous esophago-gastric anastomosis was
seen at 23 cm from the incisors. There was no visible bleeding
site in the esophagus or at the esophageal gastric anastomosis.
However, there was sdherent coffee ground material not all of
which could be washed away.
Stomach:
 Contents: Clotted blood was seen in the stomach body and
antrum. This obscured the greater curve of the antarl area and
could not be completely cleared as the clots could not be
suctioned.
 Other The stomach was s shaped.
Duodenum:
 Other normal to d3 with out a bleeding site found
Impression: Previous esophago-gastric of the esophagus
Blood in the stomach body and antrum
Normal to d3 with out a bleeding site found
The stomach was s shaped.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: If any questions or you need to schedule an
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 682**] or email at [**University/College 21854**]

The patient's bleeding site could not be ascertained due to
blood in the stomach. Plan keep HCT above or at 27. He has
already received two units PRBC. npo except for meds. IV
Protonix. We will reavaluate patient in AM and likely rescope
tomorrow.

Brief Hospital Course:
64M with history of esophageal cancer, s/p resection and
radiation, now with upper GIB.

# Upper GIB:  Pt had several episodes of hematemesis and was
found to have HCT 22 at OSH. Hct increased to 27.3 after 2 units
packed RBC's; overall down from 31 two weeks prior. He was
initially admitted to MICU for management. GI scope upon arrival
to ICU showed evidence of recent bleeding but no clear etiology
and no active bleeding; no interventions were performed. He was
continued on IV PPI and metoprolol, aspirin and plavix were
held. He continued to have melanotic stools with gradually
decreasing hematocrit. GI attempted repeat EGD however he
spontaneously went into an SVT in the 220s. This resolved with
IV lopressor, but the procedure was deferred until the following
day. The following day however, his oxygen saturations in low
90's at rest and decreased below 90% while laying flat therefore
the procedure was again postponed for gentle diuresis to improve
oxygenation. Eventually after several days of slowing decreasing
hematocrit but no overt bleeding events, he udnerwent repeat EGD
with no evidence of active bleeding. He was discharged on PPI
with GI follow-up.

# Acute blood loss anemia:  As above, [**2-9**] GI bleed which
responded appropriately to blood tranfusion .

# Coronary artery disease:  Patient denied any chest pain though
continued to have DOE. His aspirin and plavix were held given GI
bleed. Aspirin was scheduled to be restarted after discharge and
patient will discuss with his primary cardiologist risks vs
benefits of restarting plavix

# Tachycardia: Patient had persistent tachycardia despite
adequate fluid and blood replacement. This was thought to be a
physiological response from his known restrictive
pcardiomyopathy. After remaining hemodynamically stable with no
evidence of re-bleed, he was restarted on metoprolol with heart
rate stable around 100. He diud have an episode of SVT as
described above.

# Acute CHF: Patient developed decreasing oxygen saturations,
worsening dyspnea and orthopnea after initial volume and blood
resuscitation. He has chronic bilateral pleural effusions that
have not responded to diuresis and have required thoracentesis
previously therefore it was decided to proceed with
thoracentesis to improve oxygenation. Patient was
symptomatically drastically improved after unilateral
thoracentesis and was able to tolerate repeat EGD. Pleural fluid
was sent for cytology and was negative for evidence of malignant
cells. He was scheduled for outpatient appointment with
interventional pulmonary to discuss utility of right-sided
thoracentesis.

# Hypertension:  Anti-hypertensives were held initially and
restarted as above.
