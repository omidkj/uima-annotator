HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80[**Hospital 4622**]
nursing home resident who fell with unknown etiology or
mechanism.  The patient had nausea, vomiting, and seizure-
like activity in the Emergency Room.  She was immediately
intubated, evaluated by Neurosurgery, and taken to the
operating room for emergent craniotomy for evacuation of a
subdural hematoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Her temperature was 95.6,
her blood pressure was 265/169, her heart rate was 123, her
respiratory rate was 26, and saturations were 99 percent.
The patient was intubated and sedated.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination showed occipital hematoma.  The
left pupil was surgical.  The right pupil was pinpoint.
Tympanic membranes not visualized.  Chest revealed no
deformities.  The lungs were clear to auscultation.  The
abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds.  Back revealed
no deformities or step off.  Rectal examination was heme-
negative.  Poor tone.  Extremities revealed no obvious
deformities or abrasions.  Positive pulses.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram showed a
normal sinus rhythm.

A head computer tomography showed a left subdural hematoma
with a midline shift.

A computer tomography of the cervical spine revealed
degenerative joint disease, otherwise negative.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Postoperatively, it was
discovered that the patient was a do not resuscitate.  She
had had several falls at the nursing home.  The family was
unable to be located prior to surgery, and so an emergent
craniotomy was performed.

Postoperatively, the patient was in the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  The left pupil was surgical, right pupil
sluggishly reactive.  Positive corneal's sluggish
bilaterally.  No movement in any of the extremities.  Her
dressing was clean, dry, and intact.  She had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drain in place with bloody drainage.  She was on Nipride to
keep her systolic blood pressure less than 140 and
antibiotics for [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] coverage.

On [**2131-4-12**] the left pupil continued to be surgical.
The right pupil was 1 mm and nonreactive.  She had no corneal
on the right and a weak corneal on the left.  Positive cough.
Slight internal rotation of the left upper extremity to pain.
Nothing in the right upper extremity.  The toes were upgoing,
and triple flexing in her bilateral lower extremities.  Blood
pressure was kept less than 150, pCO2 of 35 to 40.  She had a
repeat head computer tomography.

The overall prognosis was poor, and the family was informed
of the results of the computer tomography which showed good
decompression of the subdural hematoma.  A computer
tomography of the head on [**2131-4-14**] showed reduction in
the subdural hematoma and mass effect with [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white
differentiation preserved.  The patient's condition remained
stable.  On [**4-14**], the patient had some spontaneous
movement in the left upper extremity. She turned her head
toward stimulation.  Slight withdrawal on the right upper
extremity.  Withdrew both lower extremities.  The toes
continued to be upgoing.  The right pupil was 2.5 mm down 1
mm and reactive.  The incision was clean, dry, and intact.

On [**2131-4-16**] the patient's family, along with the
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 47719**] the Intensive Care Unit
team regarding the patient's wishes regarding life support
and the patient's wishes to come off life support if recovery
was uncertain.  The patient was extubated and made
comfortable, and the patient passed away on [**2131-4-16**].
