History of Present Illness:
53 yo F with tracheomalacia s/p tracheostomy, mental
retardation, DM, HTN, peripheral vascular disease, recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an episode of hypotension thought to
be [**1-14**] viral gastroenteritis now presents from living facility
after being found cyanotic with O2Sat in the low 80s%,
somnolent, febrile to 101 and hyperglycemic to 283 per EMS.  She
was suctioned by EMS (thick secretion) and received Tylenol and
Ativan.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 102.4, P 128, BP 111/66, RR 32,
O2Sat 100% on 15L face mask.  Per ED sign-out, patient was noted
to have right sied and left sided infiltrate, ARF, lactate up to
4.5, + UA.  Cultures were sent from the blood and urine.  She
was given cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloaxin in addition to
650 mg Tylenol and 600 mg ibuprofen.  She was also noted to have
transient hypotension 76/50 although unclear if it is an
accurate read given that her SBP improved to the 110s with
minimal IVF.  She received 2L of IVF.  Upon transfer, her VS
T103.8F, BP 132/57, HR 115 O2Sat 97% on 50%.  She has an 18 g
IV, and is a difficult stick.  Per report, patient is usually on
trach mask and HCP is [**Name (NI) 4580**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 69888**]
.
Per the facility, patient was at her usual state of health this
morning with borderline temperature of about 100.  When they saw
her again in the afternoon, she was noted to be in respiratory
distress, fever, and agitation.  Therefore, she received Tylenol
and Ativan.  Of note, her warfarin was stopped about 3 days
prior to admission because of some bleeding around the trach
site and elevated INR up to   At that time, it was decided that
she should not be on anticoagulation anymore.
.
Upon reviewing record from [**Hospital3 **].  Patient was seen on [**5-5**]
for SOB and blood with her cough in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR for which it was held.  According to that
discharge instruction, patient was recommended to restart
warfarin once INR improves.
.
On the floor, patient appears lethargic.  Opens eyes to voice.
Denies pain.  On 3rd L of fluid.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
[**2111-5-18**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Low lung volumes.
2. Prominence and indistinctness of the hila may be due to
pulmonary vascular engorgement. Bibasilar opacities may relate
to fluid overload, although infection is not excluded.
.
[**2111-5-20**] ECHO
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure is unable to be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved global biventricular systolic function. No
pathologic valvular regurgitation or stenosis.
Compared with the prior report (images unable to be reviewed) of
[**2111-1-15**], the findings are similar.
.
[**2111-5-20**] CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. Technically limited study with no evidence of a central
(main, lobar or
segmental) pulmonary embolism.
2. Diffuse, severe tracheomalacia below the level of the
tracheostomy tube
with associated moderately severe air trapping in both lungs.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis and
consolidation in the right lower lobe.
.
[**2111-5-22**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Left PIC catheter tip projects over mid to low SVC. No
pneumothorax.
2. Unchanged right pleural effusion.
3. Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, however,
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
4. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.
