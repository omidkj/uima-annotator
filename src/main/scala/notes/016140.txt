Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain and diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
Upper Endoscopy
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This 74 year old gentleman has been experiencing abdominal
discomfort, weight loss, and diarrhea since [**Month (only) **] around the
time when he was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. He was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for his MI and was
elected for medical management in view of CRI. Pt was seen in
[**Month (only) **] by GI for his complaint of diarrhea, decreased food
intake and weight loss. At that time he denied hematemesis,
melena, hematochezia. He reports having been evaluated by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41956**] at [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center, where a CT scan
of the abdomen revealed diverticular disease of the colon, there
was no evidence of inflammatory changes in the wall of the
colon, extensive vascular calcification was seen, the liver was
not enlarged, the patient is status post nephrectomy for kidney
stones and a small cyst was found in the remaining right kidney.
Upper endoscopy was done, mild gastritis was seen as well as a
hiatal hernia, because of the fact that he is on aspirin and
Plavix no biopsies were done at that time. The patient was being
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41956**] but became somewhat frustrated for the
lack of clinical improvement and came to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second
opinion. Pt had barium study around the same time which revealed
a transient lower esophageal spasm, no hiatal hernia was found,
a small bowel x-ray was not done at that time. He is known to
have an elevated creatinine which is 3.1 at baseline. He was
also known to have mild anemia with a hematocrit of 31.6 and a
hemoglobin of 10.9.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 41957**] presented to the emergency room with essentially
the same complaint of diffuse abdominal pain and diarrhea. He
could not provided a good description of the abdominal pain. He
does state however that it was diffuse without radiation to the
back and was not related to meal. He continues to have diarrhoea
and has lost 30 pounds in the past 3 months. Recently he has
noticed some melaena and BRBPR. In ER stool was brown in colour
but guiac positive. Pt also complains of sour brash without
actual heart burn. He states he was placed on PPI with mild
relief. He was also given empirical treatment of flagyl and
mesalamine with mild relief and has now stopped taking them. In
ER he was noted to have a hct of 27 but was hemodynamically
stable without postural bp drop. He was admitted for further
evaluation of his symptoms.

Imaging:
Echo:[**2124-1-12**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed with apical and mid
lateral and inferolateral akinesis with basal hypokinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2)
Moderate(2+)aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

base, with no definite consolidation.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-1-15**] 5:36 AM
Single frontal radiograph of the chest again demonstrates a
dual- lead cardiac pacer, unchanged. The heart is enlarged,
unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. The pulmonary vasculature appears less indistinct and
there is decreased cephalization since the prior examination
consistent with improving pulmonary edema. There is improving
airspace opacity at the right lung base. Unchanged retrocardiac
airspace disease is seen. There is atherosclerotic calcification
of the aortic arch and the aorta is tortuous.
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged cardiac silhouette and improving pulmonary edema.
Improving right base airspace disease and persistent unchanged
left lower lobe airspace disease.
