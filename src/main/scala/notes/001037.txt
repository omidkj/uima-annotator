Mr. [**Known firstname 85836**] [**Known lastname 1005**] is a 54 yo man with a history of DM,
polysubstance abuse, HCV, liver cirrhosis, and gastric ulcer who
was BIBA to [**Hospital3 **] ED after being found unresponsive on his
bed by his roommate with needles scattered around him.  He had
not been seen for 2 days.  EMS was called and administered
Narcan on arrival with with minimal improvement.

At [**Hospital3 **], the pt was febrile to 105.4, for which he
received tylenol.  He was again given narcan without improvement
so was intubated.  On AC with 400/20/5/100%, ABG was
7.29/27/463.  WBC 18.4 (83%N), Hct 39.5.  Na 150, K 5.6, Cl 117,
HCO3 14, BUN 76, Cr 3.1, anion gap 27.  AST 101, ALT 38, AP 112,
TB 1.8.  CK 2431, CK-MB 9.5, Trop 1.98 (nl <0.3).  U/A with
[**10-27**] WBC and RBC, 3+ bact, + epis, ketones, [**1-12**] hyaline casts.
Tox screen was neg.  EKG without peaked T waves, ST dep in
lateral leads, old q waves in inferior leads.  CT head neg but
could not exclude mild cerebral edema due to motion artifact.
CXR with question of RML infiltrate, and as there was concern
for meningitis given his AMS, he was given vancomycin 1gm,
ceftriaxone 2gm.  He received a total of 4L NS IVF.

In our ED, initial VS were: T 101, P 131, BP 119/65, R 48, O2
sat 100% on AC 760/?/5/100%. ABG 7.25/33/81/15.  FSG 128.  Pt
was not sedated but was minimally responsive to painful stimuli.
Pupils reactive.  BS rhonchorous b/l.  No e/o trauma.  Noted to
have melena; OG tube here without any hematemesis.  Lactate 4.6.
 WBC 22.6.  Bcx drawn.  CXR without obvious infiltrate but
question of R paratracheal stripe.  An LP was not done because
of INR 3.  Patient was given tylenol 650mg pr and abx coverage
broadened to metronidazole 500mg IV and cefepime for pseudomonal
coverage.  He received 1 L NS.  On transfer to MICU, VS: T 101
(rectal), P 134, BP 112/70, RR 47, O2sat 100% on vent, CPAP
15/5, FiO2 100%.

Review of OSH records shows that pt was admitted from [**Date range (1) 85837**]
for LLE cellulitis and hematoma d/t trauma from fall; no acute
fractures.  During that hospital course, he did have a work-up
for abdominal pain. CT abd ruled out pancreatitis with an
abnormal duodenal finding; EGD showed severe duodenitis and
small esophageal varices.  He was started on pantoprazole 40mg
[**Hospital1 **].  There were concerns about drug-seeking behavior although
pt was discharged with 30 tabs of oxycodone due to recent
trauma.
