Patient is 57 yom with HX alcohol abuse, possible liver dz,
remote report pancreatic mass in an OSH last year, who initially
presented to ED with lower extremity weaknesss over the past 10

IMAGING:
CT Head:
FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally
midline structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of major
territorial infarct is apparent. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The major intracranial cisterns
are preserved. No acute fracture or extracranial soft tissue
abnormality is present. The visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
CXR:
FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in
appearance. There is hyperinflation consistent with obstructive
airways disease. Scarring is again noted in the left upper lung,
however, stable. Post-surgical changes noted in the right sixth
posterior rib. No focal consolidation is present. The vascular
structures are within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with COPD without acute process
identified
.
Abdominal U/S:
FINDINGS: The study is limited due to a background noise;
however, no liver focal masses are detected. There is no
ascites. The midline is difficult to assess including the
pancreas. Flow in the main portal vein is in the normal
hepatopetal direction. The gallbladder is unremarkable, and
there are no stones. The common bile duct is not dilated and
measures approximately 4.5 mm.

IMPRESSION: Technically limited study with no evidence of focal
liver mass or ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
Patient was admitted for presumed new onset diabetes and
possible DKA.  Patient did have mild anion-gap acidosis
initially, though this was confounded by acute renal failure,
aggressive normal saline.  Urinalysis was without ketones.  The
patient was admitted to the MICU on an insulin gtt.  Blood
sugars remained in the 200s and the insulin gtt was weaned off.
He was given 20 unit lantus with humalog sliding scale.  Normal
saline with KCl was given for fluid resuscitation.  His sugars
leveled out at 200-300.  His anion gap resolved, as did his
acute renal failure.  Abdominal ultrasound was performed for
possible history of liver disease.  The ultrasound did not
demonstrate any ascites or other obvious intraabdominal
pathology.

Floor Course:
57 y.o. M with h/o ETOH abuse, undergoing w/u for liver dz, who
presented with weaknesss/polyuria/polydipsia, and found with new
DM and DKA.

# DM likely type 2, uncontrolled: New diagnosis for patient.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended HgA1C which was 13.2%,
random cortisol to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3484**] (it was normal -10), and
anti-GAD and anti-islet cell antibodies which were sent and
pending at time of discharge.  He was kept on Insulin
monotherapy for the time being with final Lantus dose of 24
units QAM and fairly aggressive sliding scale (see below):
breakfast lunch dinner HS
80-130 6 6 6 0
131-180 8 8 8 0
181-230 10 10 10 2
[**Telephone/Fax (2) 75990**] 12 4
[**Telephone/Fax (2) 75991**] 14 6
[**Telephone/Fax (2) 75992**] 16 8
He was scheduled to follow up at the [**Last Name (un) **] on [**4-9**] at
7:30 am.  He also was given Diabetic teaching by the nurses and
nutritionists.  He was given scripts for a glucometer, strips,
lancets, insulin, and syringes.  He will follow up with his PCP
next week.

# Hyponatremia: Felt likely to be hypovolemic hyponatremia from
hyperosmolar diuresis.  He was given aggressive IVFs and his
sodium improved to the upper 120s (he came in at 115).  He will
need a repeat sodium checked by his Primary care physician.

# Liver disease, chronic: Exact etiology or nature is unknown.
He alcoholic hepatitis on admission in [**2170-10-25**].  He has a
history of chronic alcohol abuse, but also had fatty liver on
u/s in [**2170-10-25**].  He was being treated with
spironolactone/lasix, and has f/u scheduled in liver center next
week for possible biopsy.  His transaminases were checked and
normal, and a repeat RUQ u/s did not show ascites or report
fatty liver.  His diuretics were held given his hyponatremia,
but he was continued on laculose.  He will follow up in the
liver center next week.

# COPD: Stable, no evidence of exacerbation.  He was continued
on Advair, Atrovent, and Albueterol.
.
# Acute renal failure: Felt prerenal, secondary to hyperosmolar
diabetic diuresis. His creatinine normalized with normal saline.
.
# HTN: The patient was hypotensive in the ICU initially, felt
secondary to severe volume depletion.  He was given IVFs and his
BP normalized.  Metoprolol was held and can be restarted as an
outpatient.

# FEN: regular diabetic diet, hydration as above

# PPx: SC heparin was given.

# Code: Full
