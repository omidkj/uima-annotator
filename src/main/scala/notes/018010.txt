Lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 48M w/ HIV/AIDS/HCV/IVDA sent from [**Hospital1 1099**] Rehab for evaluation of 2 witnessed tonic-clonic
seizures.  Seizures occurred on evening [**2146-1-13**], lasted 30
seconds - 1 minute,  resolved spontaneously.  First seizure
occured while he was being cleaned up, second seizure occured
while family member (mother?) was in the room. His nurse
reported 'whole body shaking' L>R, not responsive to name or
sternal rub, dilated pupils, no LOC. Patient w/ foley, so not
able to assess loss of bladder function, no bowel movement
yesterday.  Patient appeared 'sleepy' afterwards but then seemed
to return to his normal self between seizures.  Hypertensive -
received nitropaste.  Afebrile, T max 99.8, BP 116-120's/86-106,
HR 78-129, O2 sat96% on 2L.  Also found to be hypokalemic with K
2.6, started on IVF @10cc/hrKcl 40 mEq [**Hospital1 **] x 6 doses.
.
No nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, no fevers/chills, no seizure
history.
Per brother, patient has had HIV encephalopathy x 1 month, not
completely oriented at baseline. His nurse describes his
baseline as oriented to self only, Spanish speaking with some
English, has sensation of pain to minimal stimulus.
.
ED Course:  arrived [**1-13**] @9pm. Never oriented, drowsy --> very
agitated.  VS 98.5, HR 97, PB 134/89, RR 16, 02 sat 100% on 2L.
Negative head CT.  Midnight - noted to have tonic clonic seizure
activity lasting 1-2 minutes, post-ictal.  O2 sat 100% on non
rebreather, weaned easily.  Given Ceftriaxone 2gm, Vanc 1gm,
Ampicillin 2gm, Acyclovir 700mg. Sedated for LP (2mg Versed and
2mg Ativan).  200mg IV Diflucan for thrush.  Morphine for pain,
received total of 12mg.  Also received 2 gm IV magnesium, NS w/
40 mEq of K x 2L. Hypertensive in 140-150s and tachy up to 130's
throughout ED stay, Tmax 100.9 (not during seizure).
.
After arrival to the ICU, it was discovered that he had a urine
culture positive for acinetobacter at rehab and was started on
imipenem. BCx had reportedly been negative after 5 days.
.
Previous hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 1100**]) for change in MS after
being found down and minimally responsive; he was intubated for
airway protection; course complicated by R neck hematoma [**1-8**] to
line placement, alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypercacemia, improved
ARF, elevated lactate, transaminitis.  Concern for toxic
metabolic encephalopathy, improved somewhat with fluids but did
not return to baseline. Also with rhabdomylosis - CK peaked at
3996, and improved to normal with IVFs, renal failure also
resolved.  He was positive for c-diff, had MRSA positive sputum,
and sparse pseudomonas growth in sputum. When discharged he
needed 6 more days to finish 14 day course of vancomycin, 10
more days to complete 15 day course of meropenem and needed to
continue on flagyl for 14 days after all other ABX completed.

At discharge, vitals were stable.  The patient was afebrile.
The patient was more oriented.  He was able to communicate his
needs in English.  His neck was rotated the left and he had some
muscular spasm.  His abdomen was benign.  The remained of his
exam was unchanged.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2146-1-23**]): Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. NG tube
tip is in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. The lungs are grossly clear. Surgical clips projecting
over the left supraclavicular area are again noted. Left PICC
remains in place.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia, rate 115 beats per minute. Right atrial
abnormality. Possible old septal myocardial infarction. Possible
left ventricular hypertrophy. Tracing is compatible with
pulmonary disease. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-12-9**] QS
complexes in leads V1-V2 are less prominent and there is less
suggestion of possible left ventricular hypertrophy. Both
tracings are compatible with pulmonary disease.

CT Head ([**2146-1-13**]):
FINDINGS: Multiple acquisitions were performed due to patient
compliance. Despite this, there is motion artifact on the study
acquired limiting the evaluation.

There again noted is extensive confluent low attenuation
throughout the deep white matter of the brain. This is likely
related to underlying HIV encephalopathy. There is a advance
atrophy for age which is consistently seen in HIV encephalopathy
as well. There is no acute interval change or midline shift. No
intracranial hemorrhage is evident.

IMPRESSION: Stable head CT examination, although the current
examination is limited as above. Findings most consistent with
HIV encephalopathy with no superimposed acute process.

CT Neck: FINDINGS:

The patient is rotated to the left side, with the neck being
rotated to the left side. Hence, this study is limited in
acquiring the images in a proper manner, centered onto the
midline of the neck. In addition, lack of IV contrast,
significantly limits evaluation for any focal infection.

Within these limitations, there are no large masses noted on the
visualized images of the neck.

However, subtle areas of increased attenuation in the fat and
inflammation cannot be assessed.

There is moderate dilatation of the esophagus with small amount
of fluid/debris within the esophagus. This finding is new
compared to the CT chest on [**2145-12-16**], with interval removal of
the nasogastric tube.
Right-sided PICC line is incompletely included on the present
study.

There are a few surgical clips, noted lateral to the left side
of the thyroid, unchanged in position, compared to the prior CT
chest on [**2145-12-16**].

There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized
images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the
head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present
study.

There is a small 4-mm soft tissue density nodule in the upper
lobe of the left lung, unchanged.

There appears to be resolution of the previously noted
pneumothorax in the apices. However, the chest is not completely
evaluated on the present study.

There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized
images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the
head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present
study.
