Chief Complaint:
Oxygen desaturation at nursing facility

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
47yo male with asthma, dCHF, complex sleep disorder/OSA,
hypoventilation syndrome requiring 3-4L at baseline presenting
from respiratory rehab with sats in the 70s on room air coming
up to 85% with nasal cannula. Pt is at mental baseline.  Denies
chest pain fever leg swelling, pleuritic chest pain. He has
shortness of breath which has improved upon presentation to the
emergency department.  Per pt this AM on floor, he woke up
yesterday "feeling bad."  His symptoms included nausea,
vomiting, "feeling asthmatic" (wheezing, SOB), and cough
productive of yellow sputum.  He says these symptoms all began
yest when we awoke.  He noticed a little dark red blood in the
vomit.  He has no h/o GI bleeding.  Denies F/C/S.  No diarrhea -
last BM a few days ago.  Pt admits to pain in chest "at first"
but it has since resolved.  Denies mucles aches, joint pains,
other pain, dysuria, runny nose, or sore throat.
.
Of note, pt has had multiple recent hospitalizations for similar
symptoms, most recently on [**2134-11-5**].  At that time, his
symptoms were attributed to hypercapnic respiratory failure
secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and complex sleep
disorder.  He had several ABG's throughout that admission that
[**Last Name (un) 22975**] stable oxygenation in the setting of [**Last Name (un) 103306**] with CO2
to ~100. During that admission he developed severe somnolence
overnight, was minimally responsive to sternal rub, and
developed hypotension to SBP 70-80s, but despite this still had
stable PO2 of 69, CO2 102, and no residual AMS with
normalization of BP upon waking.  His baseline pulse ox is high
80s at rest while awake.  He was recommended tracheostomy to
stabilize breathing but refused.
.
In the ED, he was 86%on 2L, and 90% on 4L.  CXR showed possible
pneumonia at the left base, so he was started on vanc/levo and
given nebs.  still tachypneic.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 47 year-old man with complex sleep disorder/OSA,
hypoventilation syndrome requiring 3-4L O2 at baseline who was
sent to the emergency department after an oxygen desaturation at
his nursing facility.
.
#. Respiratory Distress ?????? The patient was at respiratory rehab
due to a history of complex sleep disorder and frequent
desaturations into the 80% range. He has had multiple admissions
for respiratory failure in the past. On arrival to the ED here,
the patient's O2 sat was initially 86% on 2L and improved to 90%
on 4L. CXR showed possible pneumonia at the left base, and he
was started on vanc/levo. Admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. In the unit, the
patient was stable and afebrile. Antibiotics were not continued.
He was actively diuresed with good UOP response. The patient was
placed on BiPap. Overnight, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 103307**] had frequent
desaturations into the 70s on a setting of 20/18. The patient's
BiPap settings were titrated to 22/18 and he was diuresed
further with a lasix drip.  On the night prior to [**Name14 (STitle) **], the
patient was stable with only intermittent desats to the 80s.  He
tolerated BiPap well.  He will be discharged directly from the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] back to rehab with plans to continue BiPap and continuous
O2 supplementation.
.
#.  Erythrocytosis - The patient's initial laboratory studies
revealed a Hct of 58.4.  The patient has a h/o eryhthrocytosis
which has been attributed to chronic hypoxia.  His Hct remained
relatively stable over his hospital stay.
.
#. Schizophrenia - Continued on home medication regimen of
risperidal, doxepin and carbamazepine.  Also conitnued on
benztropine.
.
#. dCHF - Diuresed as above. Also continued on home metorpolol,
ASA. Will be discharged on 80mg [**Hospital1 **] furosemide and 2.5mg
metolazone.
.
#. Asthma - Continued on home albuterol and ipratropium nebs
.
Transitional Issues:
1) Follow-up with nursing facility to ensure patient is
receiving continuous O2 supplementation and BiPap appropriately.
2) Sleep medicine consult
3) Pulmonary medicine [**Hospital1 648**]
