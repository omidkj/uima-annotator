No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year old male with a history of obstructive
sleep apnea, COPD with a home 2 L O2 requirement, complicated by
pulmonary hypertension and RV failure who presents with a
syncopal episode 1 day prior to admission.  At baseline, Mr
[**Known lastname **] has a history of likely vascular dementia, with 2 prior
CVAs resulting in weakness, difficulties with memory recall, and
verbalization.  He was also recently admitted in [**Month (only) 404**] for an
unresponsive episode which led to a short period of intubation
secondary to respiratory distress.  Currently he lives in a
rehab setting and was previously on symptom-focused care for
management of his end-stage RV disease and COPD.

One day prior to admission, he had witnessed syncope at his
nursing home in the morning while moving his bowels.
Thereafter, his family noted that he was quite lethargic and
difficult to arouse.  No fevers or hypotension were noted.  He
was brought to the ED given his persistent lethargy and recent
syncopal episode.  Chest-xray revealed pulmonary edema and he
was given a dose of lasix.  Initial vitals were: pain 3, T 98.9,
HR 82, BP 172/135, RR 28, POx 100% on nasal cannula.  He was
somnolent but arousable to voice, answering yes/no questions.
Felt short of breath.  labs were notable for WBC 12.1, Lactate
2.9, Cr 2.3, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 11377**]; his UA was positive for >180 WBCs.  He
triggered for desatting to the 80's on RA; with 3L NC he was
88%.  CXR confirmed pulmonary edema so he received Lasix 60mg IV
as well as Levofloxacin/Ceftriaxone (no infiltrate but had
leukocytosis and elevated lactate).  Received SL NTG x2.  ABG
was pH 7.41, pCO2 48, pO2 48.  ED plans for BiPAP but have not
started it yet.  He is admitted to the MICU due to hypoxia and
respiratory distress; VS prior to transfer were HR 72, BP
195/119, RR 25, POx 90%4L NC.

Imagining:
ECHO [**2179-3-18**]

The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated The right ventricular
cavity is dilated There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [[**3-12**]+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Technically limited study. There is evidence of
chronic pulmonary hypertension, indicated by the dilated right
ventricle and right atirum. There is RV pressure and volume
overload. LV systolic function is borderline normal.

[**2179-3-18**]
CXR:

FINDINGS: The heart is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and
hilar
contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in
technique. A band-like
opacity projecting over the left mid lung suggests minor
atelectasis or
scarring. More generally, there is mild increased opacification
with
indistinct pulmonary vascularity suggesting mild pulmonary
vascular congestion
without definite focal opacities. Calcified pleural plaques are
suspected.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild pulmonary edema.

[**2179-3-18**]
CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-18**]:

Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular and hilar vascular
engorgement are chronic, consistent with global heart failure
and pulmonary hypertension. I do not think there is acute
pulmonary edema, appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of
pneumonia. Asbestos-related pleural calcifications noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  84 year old male with a history of OSA,
COPD and RV failure presents with syncopal episode in setting of
having a bowel movement.
.
# Syncope - Occurred in the setting of a bowel movement, so this
most likely represents a vasovagal episode.  He has had a
prolonged PR in the past, as well as a high de
