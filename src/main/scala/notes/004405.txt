Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Thrombocytopenia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bone marrow biopsy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year-old male with a history of presumptive Crohn's
ileitis who presents with thrombocytopenia and anemia. He
carries a presumptive diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease
since [**2166-6-8**] when he presented to [**Hospital 25143**] Hospital in New
[**Location (un) **] with small bowel obstruction, and abdominal CT
demonstrated "...ileocecal valve appears abnormal. Findings are
of concern for Crohn's disease... a soft-tissue mass is seen in
the right pelvis, this measures 4cm x 3.8cm." Colonoscopy was
done on [**2166-6-16**] and showed nodularity of terminal ileum more
pronounced than usual. Biopsy from terminal ileum was normal,
and rectal biopsy showed reactive lymphoid aggregates. He was
then started on mesalamine(Asacol) but had difficulty tolerating
it due to diarrhea. On [**2166-7-10**], he was started on prednisone
60mg, and was subsequently tapered to 40mg daily prior to
admission. He was seen on [**7-25**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3708**] in the GI
department for further evaluation. At that time he complained of
fatigue and dyspnoea and continued to have abdominal distention.
Blood work was drawn and returned showing Hct of 22 and
platelets of 20. He was instructed to discontinue mesalamine (as
a possible cause of thrombocytopenia) and to report to the
emergency room. At [**Hospital 25143**] Hospital ED, he was confirmed to have
platelets of 13 and Hct of 21 on [**7-26**]. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation, upon recommendation by the PCP.
.
Presently, the patient reports weight loss from 245 lbs. to 212
lbs. over the past one month. He continues to report marked
fatigue and exertional dyspnoea. He has not had a bowel movement
in the past 3 days. Patient reports his appetite is less than
usual, although he did eat dinner last night. He reports that
when he has bowel movements, defecation is painful, but he
denies tenesmus. Also, the bowel movements are initially
well-formed, but each bowel movement is followed by some loose
stool. No blood or mucus in stools. Patient endorses nausea, but
no vomitting. He denies fevers, vision changes, rashes, or joint
symptoms. n, or focal weakness.

Imaging:
Colonoscopy on [**2166-6-16**]:
"Mucosa of terminal ileum is nodular in the typ08ical pattern of
lymphoid nodules often seen in this area, although itis somewhat
more pronounced thn usual. Mucosa otherwise unremarkable. Lumen
of the ileum was examined for about 10 cm. Several biopsies were
taken from the ileum. Otherwise, ileocecal valve, cecal butt,
appendiceal orifice are normal ... same is true of
ascending,hepatic flexure, transverse, splenic flexure,
descending, sigmoid, and rectum. Retroflex in rectum shows
normal dentate line. Biopsy taken from rectum."

Biopsy results from [**2166-6-16**]:
"Ileum: no pathologic diagnosis

pathologic diagnosis"

SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:
DIAGNOSIS:  Extensive involvement by MALIGNANT B-CELL
NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA, high-grade, see note.

INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS
nuc ish(MYCx2)(5'MYC [**9-10**]'MYCx1)[93/100]
FISH evaluation for a MYC rearrangement was performed on
nuclei with the LSI MYC Dual Color, Break Apart
Rearrangement Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 8q24 and is
interpreted as ABNORMAL. Rearrangement was observed in
93/100 nuclei, which exceeds the range of a normal
hybridization pattern (up to 4% rearrangement) established
for this probe in our laboratory. A MYC rearrangement is
found in more than 90% of Burkitt lymphomas, but can also
be found occasionally in other histologies of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma. The MYC rearrangements in Burkitt lymphomas
result in MYC overexpression, generally by juxtaposition
with an immunoglobulin gene.

PERITONEAL FLUID
DIAGNOSIS: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,
  consistent with lymphoma.
  Highly atypical medium to large-sized lymphocytes,
  consistent with lymphoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 53-year-old gentleman who presented being
treated at OSH with steroids for several weeks for diagnosis of
Crohn's disease.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after presenting
to the ED of OSH with SOB and anemia, low platelets and
increasing abdominal girth.  He was admitted to the oncology
service at [**Hospital1 18**] and the patient was found to have pancytopenia.


Following admission, a bone marrow biopsy was done on [**2166-7-27**]
and which ultimately showed cells consistent with non-hodgkin's
lymphoma.  The patient was treated for tumor lysis syndrome in
preparation for chemotherapy.  He had a paracentesis done on
[**2166-7-29**] to remove fluid to help with respiratory distress from
restriction in the setting of abdominal distention.  Cells from
the ascitic fluid also were sent for evaluation and were found
to be positive for malignant cells and consistent with Lymphoma.
 A diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma was made based on the
available clinical evidence and the findings on diagnostic
testing conducted. He was treated with high dose steroids.

The morning following the paracentesis ([**2166-7-30**]) the patient
deveolped worsen
