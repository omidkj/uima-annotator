Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M

Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 32 year-old man
who was at lunch, complained of a headache and then vomited
times two and became unresponsive.  EMS was called and the
patient had a GCS of 7 at the scene and was transferred to
[**Hospital **] Hospital where a head CT showed diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage with clot in the gyrus rectus of the right frontal
lobe.  He is transported to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he was a young
man in no acute distress.  He was lethargic.  His pupils were
3 down to 2 mm and briskly reactive.  His extraocular
movements were full.  Chest was clear to auscultation.
Cardiac regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Neurologically
lethargic, opened his eyes briefly to voice, oriented times
one, moving all extremities spontaneously and to command.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken immediately to
arteriogram, which showed a two right ACA aneurysms both were
unable to be coiled and the patient was brought back to the
neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was monitored and
taken to the Operating Room on [**2167-7-23**] to have both
aneurysms clipped.  This was done on the 19th and was
successful without intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively, the patient's vital signs were stable.  He
was afebrile, following commands on Spanish.  He was on
Nipride and Labetalol drips.  On the 21st he became more
difficulty to arouse initially following commands and then
not.  His blood pressure was liberalized to the 160s, a Swan
was placed and he was started on HHH therapy with PA systolic
pressures of [**7-27**].  CT scan done showed blood in the
ventricles.  He was started on Mannitol for increased ICP and
spiked a temperature to 103.8.  He was pan cultured.  He was
also started on a Diltiazem drip for periods of
supraventricular tachycardia.  He continued to remain
neurologically stable.  On [**8-4**] his vent drain was increased
to 20 cm above the tragus.  On the 6th he was more alert,
inconsistently following commands.  CT scan showed enlarged
ventricles.  His drain was clamped on the 8th, but opened for
elevated ICP.  It was clamped again on the 10th and again
unclamped for elevated ICP.  On [**8-17**] he had a shunt placed in
the Operating Room.  Neurologically now post shunt placement
appeared to track with his eyes, but could not follow
commands, very minimal withdraw of the right arm and lower
extremities to noxious stimulation, moving the left side
spontaneously.  Vent drain was discontinued after the shunt
was placed on the 14th.  He was transferred to the regular
floor on [**2167-8-18**] where he has remained neurologically
stable.  For the last month he has been awake, alert,
appropriately smiling to staff, nonverbal, following simple
commands as of the last two weeks.  On the left side his
lower extremities withdraw minimally to painful stimulation.
He has been out of bed to chair and has been followed by
physical therapy and occupational therapy.  His vital signs
have remained stable.  He did have an episode of vomiting,
which started beginning last week.  He had three separate
episodes of vomiting.  KUB on those three occasions were
negative, just evidence of stool.  He was given enemas and
suppositories with good results.  Restarted on his tube feeds
on Sunday the [**8-20**] without any residual and without
evidence of nausea or vomiting.  He has been otherwise
stable.
