History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year old female with history of CLL, HTN,
lymphedema of LE, atrial fibrillation, and HCV, who is sent in
by her PCP for symptomatic bradycardia and creatinine elevation.
 The patient says that she first noted fatigue and weakness on
[**4-2**], in addition to increase in her baseline shortness of
breath.  She denied chest pain.  At that time she spoke with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] scheduled her for an echocardiogram.
She says that on the day prior to admission, while walking with
a home physical therapist, she felt extremely weak and her pulse
was found to be 40, with a BP of 85/40, per report from the
patient.  She came in for her scheduled echo on the day of
admission and again felt lightheaded.  Her pulse was noted to be
as low as the 30s at times, and she was sent to the ED.

The patient denies recent medication changes, and says that her
weight has been stable.

Additionally, the patient says that she has recently been
treated for a UTI with bactrim.  She first noted difficulty
urinating about 2 months prior to admission, at which time she
had urgency, but decreased urine output.  She was found to have
a UTI and treated with Bacrim, however symptoms recurred
recently and she was treated with a second course of abx which
she just finished on the day prior to admission.  She denies any
increase in thirst, but she continues to have decreased urine
output.  Denies fevers/chills, changes in urinary color,
dysuria.

In the ED her HR ranged in the 30s to 50s, with sbp 80-100.  She
was afebrile, with O2 sat 100% on RA.  She recieved one dose of
ASA 325 mg, and a 500 CC bolus of NS, with 50 cc urine output.

Past Medical History:
1) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
2) Hypertension
3) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, on amiodarone since [**2153**].
Gets palpiations with atrial fibrillation though not
consistently.  Had a holter in [**2155**] that did not demonstrate
atrial fibrillation.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2158-4-10**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2158-4-10**]):    NO GROWTH.

Echo [**2158-4-6**]:  Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-4**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**4-6**]:  IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. A
follow-up PA and lateral set of radiographs might be helpful if
there is continuing clinical concern for pneumonia.

EKG [**4-6**]:  Sinus bradycardia with top normal P-R interval of 200
milliseconds. Non-specific QRS interval widening. Left axis
deviation. Possible left anterior fascicular block. Anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2156-11-11**] cardiac rhythm is now sinus mechanism. Multiple other
abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.

Renal US [**4-7**]:  RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 9.7
cm. The left kidney measures 9.7 cm. There is no evidence of
stones, masses, or hydronephrosis. There is a Foley catheter
within the urinary bladder. The ureters are not dilated.
IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.

EKG [**4-7**]:  Sinus bradycardia. Compared to the previous tracing no
major change.

CXR [**4-9**]:  Temporary transvenous femoral pacemaker terminates in
the region of the tricuspid valve.  Left basilar subsegmental
atelectasis versus early infiltrate. CHF.

CXR [**4-10**]:  IMPRESSION: Satisfactorily placed cardiac pacemaker.

R Hip x-ray [**4-12**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of right hip
fracture.

EKG [**4-12**]:  Atrial paced rhythm.  Intraventricular conduction
delay - probable atypical left bundle branch block.  Consider
prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.  Clinical correlation
is suggested.  Since previous tracing of [**2158-4-11**], atrial pacing
seen.

CXR [**4-13**]:  IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with
associated compressive atelectasis. No CHF or pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old female with history of CLL, HTN, lymphedema of LE,
atrial fibrillation, and HCV, who was sent in by her PCP for
symptomatic bradycardia and creatinine elevation.  In brief, she
had an AV pacer placed in house, with normalization of her blood
pressure and renal function subs
