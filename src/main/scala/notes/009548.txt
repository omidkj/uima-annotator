Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Motrin Ib

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Throat tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
33 year-old man transferred from OSH for treatment of throat
tightness and pneumonia. He is admitted to the ICU for closer
monitoring given concern of allergic reaction and history of
severe [**Known lastname **] [**Location (un) **] reaction in [**2110**].

His current symptoms started several days ago with URI-type
symptoms. Patient developed chest tightness, sore throat, dry
cough, and sensation of "lips feeling leathery" and dry over the
course of three days (since Saturday). He notes that his
girlfriend was [**Name2 (NI) **] with [**Name (NI) 50513**] symptoms and he may have
picked something up from her.

Over the weekend he had taken aspirin on-and-off for four days
(not containing Motrin per his report). Around this time he
developed worsening throat tightness, and he decided to go to
[**Location (un) **] ED for further evaluation. From [**Location (un) **] ED he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], his initial vital signs were T 97.2, HR 92,
BP 148/108, RR 20, satting 95% RA. He was noted to be talking in
full sentences, although his voice was hoarse. On exam, there
was no stridor or wheezing. Labs were remarkable for a white
count of 9.5 with 72% polys, no bands. CBC was otherwise normal
with normal BMP. An EKG showed NSR with no ischemic changes. CXR
showed indistinctness of the left heart border with concern of
atalectasis versus pneumonia. Patient had already received
ceftriaxone at OSH for concern of pneumonia and was given
azithromycin here at [**Hospital1 18**]. In addition he received 4 mg of
Zofran, 4 mg of morphine and 125 mg of methylprednisolone.
During his time in the ED he felt increasing throat tightness,
and due to the complicated history of [**Known lastname **]-[**Location (un) **] reaction,
he was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. Vitals at time
of transfer were T 97.8, HR 80, BP 140/80, RR 18, satting 97%
RA.

Of note, in [**2110**] the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for SJS
involving the airway mucosa- his hospital course was complicated
by DVT and LUL pulmonary embolism. He had a long admission
requiring intubation (from [**9-28**] to [**10-19**]) and ultimately
tracheostomy placement. He had presented originally with SOB and
fever three months after treatment of pneumonia with ceftriaxone
and levofloxacin. At presentation he had a vesicular rash. His
micro work-up was all negative with the exception of an elevated
IgM and IgG for Mycoplasma pneumonia. He had a deep skin biopsy
that showed erythema multiforme. He was initially treated with
vancomycin, acyclovir, ceftriaxone, which was later changed to
levofloxacin, and then to azithromycin (for a 21-day course
total of antibiotics). During the admission, he had thick
blood-tinged expectorant from his lungs felt to be consistent
with desquamation caused by [**Known lastname **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome. Note is
made from that discharge summary that he had a very traumatic
intubation and that the anesthesiologist performing the
procedure saw a desquamated, ulcerated, and "raw-appearing"
posterior pharynx.

CXR IMPRESSION: Probable lingual scarring. No evidence of
pneumonia.

CT CHEST (PRELIM): Bronchiectasis, no pneumonia

Brief Hospital Course:
# Shortness of breath: Pt presented with 2-3 days of lethargy,
cough, congestion and possible lingular infiltrate on chest
x-ray. Exam was remarkable for coarse breath sounds diffusely,
L>R.  Pt was started on empiric Levofloxacin and steroids for
possible SJS. HE was notably tachycardic and dehydrated on exam,
he was given 2liters of IVF and HR trended down with increased
UOP.  Pt was started on nebs and reported improved breathing and
cough. Due to abnormal findings on CT chest from [**2111**], he
underwent a follow up CT which was notable for resolution of
nodules and subtle tree/[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities.  Levofloxacin was
initially continued for CAP and pt was called out to floor but
on the floor it was thought that his symptoms were mainly due to
URI like process so abx were discontinued. the pt was discharged
with supportive care on albuterol/ipratropium, fluticasone
inhalers. he is to f/u with his PCP in the next week.

# History of [**Known lastname **]-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15813**]: occurred in the setting of
Motrin use and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Currently
patient with no evidence of mucosal sloughing or rash. Steroids
started empirically and stopped after resolution of oral &
throat discomfort, no evidence of rash. On discharge the pt was
stable without any evidence of SJS.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Acute bronchitis vs Viral syndrome with reactive airways

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted due to shortness of breath and cough. At first
there was concern that you could develop symptoms similar to
your past admission for [**Known lastname **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome. You were given
IV steroids and antibiotics and transferred to the ICU for
monitoring. You fortunately did not develop any life threatening
respiratory symptoms or any concerning symptoms for
[**Known lastname **]-[**Location (un) **]. It is thought that you likely suffer from a
viral illness with reactive airways, and that antibiotics are
not needed. You should take fluticasone inhaler for 10 days,
albuterol/ipratropium inhaler, tylenol, and cepacol as needed
for the next few days to control your wheezing and respiratory
symptoms. There were no other changes to your medications.
