Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, self-extubation.

History of Present Illness:
72yo F with a PMHx of severe COPD (on home oxygen, multiple
recent admissions requiring intubation), dCHF, T2DM
(insulin-dependent), OSA on home BiPAP, atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, and CKD who presented to the ED with increased work of
breathing.
Per EMS report, the family noticed that sometime between last
night and today, patient began having shortness of breath and
altered mental status. EMS arrived to find the patient on her
[**Last Name (un) **] BiPAP (family thought that it might help with SOB) sitting
in a chair with her neck flexed forward and tongue exnteded,
awake confused, tachypneic, with shallow respiration. She was
noted to be cool, clammy, with distant lung sounds and fine
rales 3/4 up. She was noted to have an O2 Sat of 88% on RA as
well as hypertensive. Her FSBG at the scene was 219. The patient
was initially give O2 via NR, but then changed to CPAP when she
was noted not to have improvement in her SOB. She was then
transferred via EMS to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, patient was oriented only to self noted to be using
accessory muscle use. Vital signs on arrival: 160/100, 100
(afib), RR 35-45, 98% on CPAP. ABG was significant for pCO2 of
98. Her exam was notable for bilateral rales. She was on a nitro
gtt briefly for The patient as intubated with 20mg etomidate and
120mg succs given IV reportedly with no difficulties. During
intubated, the ETT was noted to have pink and brown mucous. She
was started on antibiotics for treatment of PNA with Vanc and
Zosyn. Patient currently on propofol for sedation. A foley was
placed. The patient had transient episodes of hypotension, which
the ED resident attributed to auto PEEPing (he was able to
express air from her chest while pressing down on the patient's
chest) as well as sedation. Her lung exam was noted to have
worsen with worsening rales than when she presented. She was
given 40mg of IV lasix prior to transfer to the floor. Patient
received a total of 400cc of IVFs since arrival in the ED via
medications. Vent settings prior to transfer: CMV, FiO2 40%,
PEEP 6, RR 14, TV 400mL. Vital signs on transfer: 97.8, 73
(afib), 107/50, 92-98% (vented).

On arrival to the MICU, the patient is intubated and sedated.

Review of systems: Unable to obtain as the patient is intubated
and sedated.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo female with severe COPD and OHS on home oxygen, OSA on
BiPAP, afib, and chronic diastolic heart failure (EF 75%)
recently admitted [**6-/2198**] for acute hypercarbic respiratory
failure requiring intubation presented to the ED in respiratory
distress found to have an acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure exacerbation in the setting of recent IVF
administration.

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation: Likely
secondary to IVF administration at an OSH in the setting of
diarrhea.  Patient initially had lower extremity edema which
improved after diuresis.  She was returned to her home
furosemide dose on day 2 of her admission and responded with
adequate diuresis. In addition carvedilol was added to
benazepril 40 and amlodipine 10 for improved BP control.

# Hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely baseline
pCO2 around 75 or 80. The patient was diuresed as above, but did
not have signs of COPD flare.  She was continued on her her home
COPD inhalers.  She needs full PFTs as it is unclear how much of
her chronic hypercarbia is OHS vs COPD.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
with med compliance, may also have diet compliance issues; BPs
likely not well-controlled.  Nutrition consult was obtained for
dietary education.

# Hypertension: Uncontrolled on benazepril 40 and amlodipine 10.
Carvedilol was increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] on discharge. The patient
was instructed to followup as an outpatient. Metoprolol was
discontinued.

# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled. INR therapeutic on
warfarin.

# Stage 3 CKD: Baseline serum creatinine 1.9-2.1. Patient
currently within baseline.

# Normocytic Anemia: Chronic, at baseline hct.

# DM: last HgbA1c 8.6 in [**5-26**]: cont home lantus and ss

# Glaucoma: Continue latanoprost, apraclonidi
