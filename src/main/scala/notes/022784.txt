History of Present Illness:
69 yo male with h/o AAA s/p repair, mesenteric ischemia s/p
resection, CAD, HTN, PVD, CRI who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab
with seizures. He was intubated, admitted to ICU, and controlled
on VPA, dilantin, phenobarbitol and keppra. He had a prolonged
intubation, and had a tracheostomy performed on [**2185-5-11**]. He has
been on nuerology service for propofol induce coma for focal
motor status epilepticus presumably due to right hemisphere
cortical infarcts. His admission has been highlighted by
intubation, tracheostomy, and successful placement of PMV,
pneumonia, UTI, GPC bacteremia.
.
He started becoming hyponatremic around [**5-17**]. His sodium was
normal on admission, and was stable until this time. Since then,
it has slowly drifted down to 124. His other electrolytes,
including renal function, has been stable during this time. He
started with tube feeds on [**2185-4-24**]. His initial free water
flushes were 30ml q 6 hours. On [**2185-5-17**] his free water flushes
were increased to 100ml q 4 hours. On [**2185-5-23**] his free water
flushes were decreased to 100mg q 6 hours. Today, [**2185-5-25**], his
free water flushes were decreased to 50mg q 6 hours. Serum osm
were 276 on [**2185-5-17**]. Urine sodium on [**2185-5-18**] was 71. Urine osm on
[**2185-5-18**] were 292. Subsequent urine osm 400s [**5-23**].
.
He has also been anemic during this admission. He was admitted
with a hct of 45% last admission, and it has been mostly in the
mid 20's to mid 30's since that time. It has gotten as low as
19.9% on [**2185-5-11**]. He has been transfused 2 units [**2185-5-3**], two
units on [**2185-5-11**], and 1 unit on [**2185-5-15**]. Per report, he has been
having diarrhea, and is guaiac positive, though no clear melena.
He has never had a scope in our system. He has not had any iron
studies during this admission.
.
He has had several infectious issues, he was treated with
meropenem from [**5-3**] to [**5-13**] for resistant E. coli UTI and
pneumonia. He has had several negative c.diff cultures, and was
treated with flagyl empirically for several days. This has been
stopped. On [**5-23**] he was started on cipro for an e.coli UTI
(found [**5-27**] to be cipro resistent), and on [**5-25**] he was started
on vanco for coag. negative staph in [**3-13**] blood culture bottles.

.
Review of Systems: Currently, he only c/o headache, frustration
at not being able to get out of bed, unable to speak w/o PMV.

CTA Head and neck and CT perfusion [**4-23**]:
1.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.  No
asymmetry identified on the CT perfusion study.
2.  Atherosclerotic calcifications involving the origins of the
great vessels from the aortic arch.  Atherosclerotic
calcifications at the origins of the vertebral arteries
bilaterally and stenosis involving these origins cannot be
excluded.
3.  No hemodynamically significant stenosis involving the
carotid arteries
throughout their course bilaterally.
4.  Unremarkable CTA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
.
MRI/MRA Head [**4-23**]:
1.  Scattered, tiny foci of diffusion-weighted imaging
abnormality involving the cerebral hemispheres and the left
thalamus which could represent subacute infarction.
2.  Signal dropout involving the supraclinoid right internal
carotid artery which is likely secondary to atherosclerotic
calcified plaque causing moderate stenosis as seen on the
previous CT angiogram.
.
EEG [**4-23**]:
This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to
the runs of rhythmic slowing in the right central region and
posterior quadrant with superimposed sharp waves and persistent
intermixed theta and delta slowing. These abnormalities suggest
brief electrographic seizures in the right posterior quadrant
with evidence of underlying subcortical dysfunction
.
EEG [**4-25**]:
This telemetry captured six pushbutton activations. Two of those
and several of the automated seizure detection segments showed
clinical seizures. At baseline, there was high voltage right
hemisphere and especially right frontal sharp wave discharges
that were not particularly rhythmic but recurred at about 1.5-2
Hz throughout the recording. When these became more rhythmic or
when there was still faster activity with spread of slowing to
the left, there appeared to be clinical seizures. Many of these
clinical seizures were primarily jerking of the left body, but
with bilateral EEG changes there was jerking activity on the
right, as well. The tracing suggests frequent clinical seizures
along with a persistent and active epileptogenic lesion in the
right hemisphere, likely anteriorly
