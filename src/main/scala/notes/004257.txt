Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent Tracheobronchomalaciae

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
  Cervical tracheal resection and tracheoplasty ([**2155-12-22**])


History of Present Illness:
54yo F w/ a PMHx significant for prior tracheoplasty/bilateral
mainstem bronchioplasty w/ mesh ([**2152-12-19**]) represented with
recurrent symptoms of cough and SOB over a 6 month history.
This was quite debilitating for her and she elected to
re-explore a work-up for its etiology.  Work-up revealed
recurrent tracheobronchomalacia and the patient elected to
undergo a primary cervical tracheal resection in an attempt to
palliate the dynamic upper airway collapse that she manifested
(while knowing that the lower airways still have collapse
occuring but that a re-thoracotomy and dissection of the
bronchi/mediastinal trachea with the incorporated mesh was too
risky, etc).

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent a primary repair of her trachea after a
2.5cm segment of cervical trachea was resected and
re-anastamosed (no mesh, interrupted vicryl utilized).
Post-peratively, the patient did very well.  Her diet was serial
advanced, pulmonary toilet was administered.  She complained of
intermittent cough (non-productive) and headache.  Bedside
bronchoscopy x2 showed an intact anastamosis and minimal
secretions.  A sty suture was removed from her chin by POD#5 and
she was dismissed home on POD#7 with instructions not to stretch
her neck and limit her ROM.  She was afebrile, with adequate
oral analgesia and with no evidence of a wound
hematoma/cellutitis.  The patient additionally completed a one
week course of Clindamycin to cover for upper respiratory track
pathogens in the wound bed.  On the day of dismissal, a
bronchoscopy was completed that showed no evidence of necrosis,
ischemia or dehiscence with minimal secretions.
