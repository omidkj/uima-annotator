Admission Date:  [**2150-3-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2150-3-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2102-8-29**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is  47 year old
male with a history of Hodgkin's disease as well as chronic
pleural effusions, unknown origin who was admitted to the
hospital for a right and left heart catheterization to
determine if there is any cardiac evidence or etiology of the
pleural effusions.  This catheterization was done on [**2150-3-17**].  During the cardiac catheterization, at the
conclusion of the right coronary angiography the patient was
noted to be dysarthric and flaccid on the right side, having
previously been quite conversant and normal after the left
coronary angiography.  Therefore, the Stroke Team and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] was notified.  The patient was sent to Interventional
Radiology where he had angiography of the cerebral
circulation of the left mid cerebral artery occlusion which
was resolved with intraarterial TPA resulting over the course of
several hours in the improvement in the patient's neurologic
findings.  The patient did have a head computerized tomography
scan thereafter showing no evidence of acute hemorrhage or
infarction prior to this.  He was admitted to the Neurosurgery
Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.  After being managed
in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for continued post catheterization care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hodgkin's disease with his last
chemotherapy approximately one year ago; 2.  Recurrent
pleural effusions for which she received periodic
thoracentesis in a hospital at some time in [**Location (un) 3844**]; 3.
History of pericardial effusion, status post pericardial
window; 4.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in
[**2150-1-1**], status post right coronary artery metal
stenting times two; 5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease; 6.
Anxiety.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Paxil 40 mg once a day, Clonazepam 1 mg
b.i.d., Lipitor 10 q.d., Toprol 50 q.d., Lasix 40 q.d.,
potassium chloride 20 b.i.d., sublingual Nitroglycerin prn,
Protonix 20 q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service the
patient's vital signs revealed temperature 98.8, blood
pressure 130/70, pulse 98, respirations 16 and oxygen
saturation of 95% on 3 liters of nasal cannula.  On physical
examination the patient was sitting up in bed, alert in no
acute distress and is comfortable with the nasal cannula.  In
his neck there was no noted jugulovenous distension.  His
heart was slightly tachycardiac, regular rate and rhythm with
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  On his lung examination, the
breath sounds were decreased bilaterally, left greater than
right up to approximately one-half the way on the chest
posteriorly.  His abdomen was soft, nontender.  There was no
lower extremity edema to be noted.  Pulses were 2+.

LABORATORY DATA:  On laboratory evaluation complete blood
count was unremarkable.  Chemistry panel was unremarkable
with normal renal function and electrolytes.  The patient's
coagulase studies were within normal limits.  Chest x-ray,
the patient had left lower lobe atelectasis, decreasing in
size with bilateral pleural effusions.  The head computerized
tomography scan done [**3-17**], showed no evidence of acute
hemorrhage.  The patient, also on [**3-17**], had a
computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis
without contrast which was done for some report of back pain,
status post catheterization which showed no evidence of
retroperitoneal hematoma and the bilateral pleural effusions
noted on chest x-ray.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - Per the cardiac
catheterization it was noted that the patient had mildly
increased right-sided pressures and left-sided pressures with
a right atrial pressure of approximately 12 and a mean wedge
pressure of 16.  There was no evidence of constrictive
pericarditis and there was moderate diastolic ventricular
dysfunction.  These were not felt to be significant for it to
be a cause of the patient's pleural effusions.  Thus, from a
cardiovascular standpoint, management was centered on his
coronary artery disease for which Aspirin was restarted on
day #2 after the cerebrovascular accident.  No further Plavix
had been required after the one month for which the patient
was on after his stenting in [**2150-1-1**].  The patient's
beta blocker will be restarted on day #3, status post a
cerebrovascular accident which was held due to the desire to
keep his blood pressure approximately 140 systolic after the
event of the cerebrovascular accident.  Thus, the patient
will be continuing on Aspirin and beta blocker for coronary
artery disease management after discharge.

2.  Cerebrovascular accident - The patient as noted above did
have intraarterial TPA administration within the Interventional
Neuroradiology Suite by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**].  The intraarterial TPA
administration was successful, resolving the
majority of the patient's symptoms, leaving him with a
residual aphasia and word-finding deficit.  Immediately
following the intervention head computerized tomography scan
was negative for any hemorrhage.  The patient then had a
follow up magnetic resonance imaging scan/magnetic resonance
angiography on day #2 of hospitalization which essentially
showed infarction in the left mid cerebral artery
distribution in varying stages of evolution.  From a
neurologic standpoint there was no further intervention for
this stroke aside from continuing the patient on Aspirin.  It
was unclear exactly what the etiology of the stroke was.  It
was felt unlikely that this was a cholesterol-after emboli
given that he is in lysis with the TPA and the situation in which
this occurred.  There was a possibility given that blood clots
may have formed surrounding the catheter which a rare occurrence,
so hypercoagulable tests were obtained which were pending on
discharge.  It was not felt likely the patient required a
transesophageal echocardiogram during hospitalization but if
deemed to be useful, the patient may have this procedure done
as an outpatient.

3.  For the residual deficits, status post cerebrovascular
accident, the patient did have occupational therapy, physical
therapy and swallowing evaluation.  The swallowing evaluation
was normal.  They recommended having at some point in time a
formal speech evaluation.  Occupational therapy and physical
therapy also cleared the patient as he was walking well and
had normal functionality prior to discharge.  Thus, it would
be recommended the patient will follow up as an outpatient
for language therapy, occupational therapy and physical
therapy.

4.  For the pleural effusions which are chronic and of
unclear etiology, the patient is to continue with
thoracentesis as needed.  He will be scheduled for
pleurodesis per his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
[**Location (un) 3844**].  The patient will continue with Lasix q.d.
which is decreased from b.i.d. dosing due to developing
slight dehydration.

At the time of discharge on hospital day #4, the patient had
significant resolution of his neurologic symptoms, status
post the cerebrovascular accident and will continue to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] as needed as well as his primary care
physician in [**Location (un) 3844**].

FOLLOW UP:
1.  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] within three to
four weeks.
2.  The patient will follow up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within one week.
3.  The patient will receive outpatient services,
occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech therapy.

FINAL DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Clonazepam 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Paroxetine 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Right/left heart catheterization for chronic pleural
effusions demonstrating mildly right and left-sided
pressures, moderate diastolic dysfunction.
2.
