Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72yo vasculopathic F with ESRD on HD (BL Cr [**4-11**]), bilateral
BKAs, DM2 (HbA1c 5.2), HTN, CHF (EF 50%), hx of MRSA line
infection admitted for ongoing MRSA bacteremia and recent yeast
fungemia on dapto as well as MS for pain.
.
#. MRSA + yeast line sepsis: Patient with high grade bacteremia
and fungemia persisting on Abx. HD line removed and grew MRSA at
tip. I&D at site of HD line by surgery. On daptomycin from
[**2197-11-18**] onwards with clear cultures since that time. Therefore
new tunnelled line was placed [**2197-11-24**] by IR. Before that pt has
been on multiple abx regimens to treat her perisitent
bacteremia. TTE had been negative, but TEE was not possible in
this pt. Plan was to continue QOD dapto v vanco for 6 weeks from
last confirmed negative culture per endocarditis protocol. If pt
re-infected to consider chronically infected DVTs and move to
CMO.
.
#. Chronic upper extremity DVTs: On coumadin at home. On heparin
drip for line replacement. Concern is that these clots are
infected and serving as source for her ongoing bacteremia. [**Month (only) 116**]
need long term ABx
.
#. Pain: evidently chronic. Reason unclear. Followed closely for
localizing s/s, but nothing ever really localized. On standing
dilaudid plus breakthrough dose as well as standing tylenol per
palliative care with good effect.4
.
#. ESRD: Lytes stable on HD. Cont nephrocaps, cincalcet
.
#. Seizure d/o s/p CVA. Cont keppra.
.
#. Mental status: Per prior housestaff discussion with HCP, pt
has had subacute decline over the last year. Usually oriented to
self. Appears to be at baseline. Moaning in pain but able to
interact.
.
# Elevated LFTs: Abd exam intermittently concerning, but not
clearly [**Last Name 5283**] problem. [**Name (NI) **] of ALT 63* AST 72* AP 279* on [**11-6**].
Resolved spontaneously.
.
#. DM: RISS
.
#. Anemia: Chronic. Baseline around 29-33. Cont Folic acid and
Procrit at HD. Was using 22 as cutoff for xfusion.
.
#. Chronic orthostatic hypotension: Cont Midodrine 10mg TID
.
#. Glaucoma: Cont Timolol gtts, Lumigan gtt
.
#. Healed sacral decubitus ulcer: Chronic, noted at admission.
.
# Course the day of death: Pt had good AM, went to IR for
tunnelled line placement and returned in the evening hypotensive
and tachycardic. TAchycardia had been a problem for the past 48
hours. Was planning pRBC transfusion. Pt ultimately became
diaphoretic and increasingly tachypneic as well as tachycardic.
Trid IVF with little success. After dinner was noted to be
coughing. Sats dropping. CXR looked improved to last check. ABG
was attempted but seems to have been venous blood. Notably,
lactate was 4.7. Concern was for aspiration PNA v fluid overload
v. PE v. DIC/sepsis. Family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed of course
and agreed to current plan of DNR DNI. Pt became apneic and
developed PEA. Eventually pass. Family agreed to autopsy.
