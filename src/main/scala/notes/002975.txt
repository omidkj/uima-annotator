Chief Complaint:
Left leg pain, swelling

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a longstanding history of
left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, with originally
identified thrombus
approximately 20 years ago complicated by pulmonary embolism and
treatment with IVC filter placement.  The patient noted
increasing swelling at the left lower extremity approximately 3
weeks prior to original presentation and was seen at an outside
facility, where CT scan demonstrated significant thrombus along
the length of the left lower extremity with evidence of
calcification of the pre-existing thrombus along the length of
the leg, extending into the inferior vena cava up to the level
of the IVC filter.

esophagogastrectomy in [**2188-11-16**] ([**Doctor Last Name **]) c/b
recurrent post op bleed for esophagitis. Nl sig [**6-19**], Nl
colonoscopy, SBFT [**3-19**].
2. DMII diagnosed in [**2178**].
3. Deep venous thrombosis; s/p provoked DVT and unprovoked
pulmonary embolism. Hypercoagulation work-up negative. IVC
filter placed perioperatively for esophagectomy.

4. Bipolar disorder.  Depression
5. Sleep apnea (not on  CPAP since surgery, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

[**Doctor First Name **]
Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 150
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   62 year old man with phlegmalasia and IVC filter
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   Ct venogram of the mid thicgh region tot he diaphragm to eval
clot burden
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.

Final Report
INDICATION: 62-year-old man with phlegmalasia and IVC filter.

Evaluate IVC filter to determine presence of clot burden.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
abdomen and
pelvis with the administration of IV contrast. A CTV protocol
was used to
assess the abdominal veins and extremity veins upto the mid
thigh.
Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed.

FINDINGS: There is left lower lobe atelectasis, less likely
infectious
process. Otherwise, the lungs are clear. No pleural effusion.
Large hiatal
hernia is noted.

The liver shows no focal liver lesions. Minimal intrahepatic
biliary dilation is noted. The common bile duct measures 10 mm.
These are likely secondary to post-cholecystectomy state. The
patient is status post cholecystectomy. The spleen, pancreas,
and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable. Both kidneys
demonstrate mild perinephric stranding which is likely
nonspecific.  Parapelvic cysts are noted in the left kidney.
Bilateral hypodensities, too small to characterize, are noted
within both kidneys which likely represent renal cysts.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable.
There is some free fluid within the pelvis which may represent
postoperative change, correlate clinically.
The infrarenal IVC filter appears well seated within the vena
cava with clot in the center which extends into bilateral common
iliac veins as well as into the left external iliac, left common
femoral, left superficial femoral veins.
There is a minimal amount of clot noted in the origin of the
left profunda
femoral vein with reconstitution beyond this point. The right
external iliac, common femoral, and superficial femoral veins
are patent.
There is no free air within the abdomen. The bladder and distal
ureters are unremarkable.
Visualized osseous structures are grossly unremarkable. There is
some
surrounding soft tissue subcutaneous stranding within the left
thigh.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large hiatal hernia.
2. Minimal intrahepatic biliary dilation and dilation of common
bile duct to 10 mm, likely post-cholecystectomy.
3. Parapelvic cysts on the left and bilateral hypodensities, too
small to
characterize, in bilateral kidneys.
4. Small amount of fluid in the pelvis may represent
