Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
Persistent headache and confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71 year old left handed man with a history of
recent ruptured appendix and PE on Coumadin, ? atrial
fibrillation, HTN, HLD, and DM who presents with a 3 week
history of left frontal/orbital headaches, a 1 day history of
vomiting, and then was transferred after an unwitnessed fall at
the OSH with subsequent dysarthria.

The patient reported a history of right frontal/bilateral
orbital headaches over the past 3 weeks. He reports that he
usually doesn't get headaches, so this is unusual. He denies
photophobia/phonophobia, nausea, weakness/numbness, diplopia.
The headaches can be worse when he is laying down flat, and
improve when he sits up. He has not noticed if the headache
changes in character with Valsalva maneuver. He was recently
started on HCTZ for blood pressure control, which was
discontinued; however he continues to have headaches. He had a
head CT on [**2161-1-2**] given his headaches, which showed "nothing
acute." On the morning of admission, he had vomiting at home,
therefore he was taken to [**Hospital3 **] for further evalution.

At the OSH, bp was 131/81 and labs showed glucose 189, Na 138,
WBC 8.5, Hct 33.8, INR 2.0. While in the ED, he had an
unwitnessed fall with "syncope in the bathroom", and subsequent
slurred speech after the event. He was given Versed 9 mg vs. 20
mg, Ativan 2 mg, and Dilaudid 1 mg. He was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.

Social History:
reviewed in OMR. Of note, he usually lives in [**State 108**], but was
recently hospitalized there with a ruptured appendix, so has
been living with his daughter in [**State 350**] recently.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2161-2-4**]**

   RAPID PLASMA REAGIN TEST (Final [**2161-2-4**]):
      NONREACTIVE.
      Reference Range: Non-Reactive.

Brief Hospital Course:
At [**Hospital1 18**], his blood pressure on admission was 211/114 and he
received Ativan 2 mg IV and Midazolam 2.5 mg IVP. CXR showed
mild-to-moderate CHF. Head CT showed no acute intracranial
process. CT C-spine showed no fracture. Neurology was consulted
in the ED, and thought this may have been vasovagal syncope in
the setting of vomiting. He was admitted to the MICU for further
work up, given his somnolence after heavy sedation. In the MICU,
he had an MRI/MRA/MRV performed which was normal. Ophthalmology
was consulted, and determined he had no papilledema or disc
swelling. His INR was reversed for an LP with Vitamin K, which
showed [**1-28**] WBC, [**12-19**] RBC, 54 protein, 57 glucose. Gram stain,
cytology and fluid culture were negative.  HSV PCR and viral
culture were negative.  A routine EEG was normal.

The patient does not remember what happened at [**Hospital3 **].
On the floor, blood pressure medications were titrated up with
resolution of his headaches.  He was continued on a heparin drip
and restarted on coumadin.  He was noted to have persistent
gross blood in his urine in the setting of a foley catheter
placement and heparing drip.  A CT abdomen and pelvis with
contrast showed a small non-obstructing left renal calculu
