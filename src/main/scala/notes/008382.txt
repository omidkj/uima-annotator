Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p STEMI, cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation (already intubated when presented from outside
hospital)
Swan-Ganz Catheter
Tandem Heart placement with ECMO device
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention s/p Drug Eluting Stent to
Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery

History of Present Illness:
76F with h/o HTN was transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for
CABG evaluation after cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99%
LAD stenosis with the cath procedure complicated by VT x2 s/p
cardioversion and Afib s/p cardioversion.  Per report, patient
syncopized at home after a trip to bathroom, witnessed by
daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] was unresponsive for 20-30 seconds and
patient soon became alert and vomitted.  She was complaining of
chest pain radiating to abdomen.  Daughter called EMS, and
patient was brought to [**Hospital6 **] ED.
.
On arrival to OSH ED at 7:25am, EKG showed ST elevations in I,
AVL, V1-V2, ST depressions in II, III, AVF, V3-V6.  Patient was
given Aspirin, heparin, plavix and lasix 20mg IV, and was taken
to cath lab emergently.  Patient arrived at the cath lab at
8:12am with cardiogenic shock and CHF with ongoing chest pain.
Dopamine was started right away, with levophed added at about
10am.  IABP was placed as well.  Immediate right heart cath
showed PCWP of 44mmHg.  Patient was intubated during the cath
procedure for respiratory distress.  LHC demonstrated high grade
distal 95% stenosis in LM at trifurcation with LAD, LCX and
ramus branch with TIMI 1 flow into LAD and LCX. 99% stenosis was
noted in proximal LAD. PTCA with 2.5mm balloon sequentially into
LAD adn LCX was performed with restoration of TIMI 4 flow and
moderate residual stenosis in LM. The Cardiac cath was
complicated by VT x 2 s/p cardioversion to sinus rhythm.  At
that time, decision was made for emergent transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
CABG.  Electrical conversion of atrial fibrillation to a normal
sinus rhythm was achieved.
.
Of note, the labs drawn at 7:43am showed K of 2.7.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was hypothermic to 80sF, on
dopamine 20, she was unresponsive on no sedation, and brain stem
reflexes were minimal with very sluggish pupillary response.
Bleeding was noted around ETT, so she was bronch'd.  Her labs
were notable for CK of 8807, CK-MB and troponin > assay.
Lactate rose to 8.2.  After endotracheal bleeding slowed down,
decision was made to transfer patient to CCU for initiation of
Arctic Sun Cooling protocol, but prior to transfer patient woke
up as her temp came up.  Since she continued to have some
neurological deficits, she was started on Arctic Sun at 10:30pm.
 Furthermore, prior to transfer to CCU, ETT was noted to be
leaky, and on repeat bronch, the ETT was found to be above the
cord.  It was re-positioned by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] prior to transfer.

Microbiology:
Sputum cultures [**2142-1-3**], [**2142-1-4**], [**2142-1-5**], [**2142-1-8**], [**2142-1-11**],
[**2142-1-16**], [**2142-1-23**] grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Urine culture [**2142-1-3**]: pan-sensitive E. coli
.
Echocardiogram (TTE) [**2141-12-31**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
septum and anterior walls, distal half of the lateral wall and
apex. The remaining segments contract well (LVEF 30%). No left
ventricular thrombus is seen, but images are suboptimal to fully
exclude. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild [1+]
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD
(Proximal LAD and LCX distribution). Right ventricular apical
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic
regurgitation.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**2142-1-1**]:
1. Two vessel and left main coronary artery disease.
2. Successful placement of Tandem heart mechanical support
device.
3. Successful removal of the IABP.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**2142-1-17**]:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the LMCX, LAD and LCX.
3. Successful placement of IABP.
4. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
5. Normal cardiac index.
.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**2142-1-9**]:
1. Uniform enhancement of the pancreas without evidence for
necrosis however there is development of small fluid collections
anterior to the body and at the tail of the pancreas, which may
represent early developing pancreatic pseudocyst. No definite
evidence for abscess.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis have
improved.
However, bilateral ground glass opacities and right middle lobe
opacities have worsened. Findings may be due to ARDS or
worsening pneumonia.
3. Dilation of the CBD may reflect papillary stenosis.
4. Heterogeneous enhancement to the liver likely reflects
contrast timing.  No focal lesions are identified.
