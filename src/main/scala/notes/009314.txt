Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38277**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, need for BIPAP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 yo M with hx CAD s/p BMS x2 to the LAD [**5-19**], CHF
(EF 25-30%) who presented with chest pain.

Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] [**Date range (1) 111860**].  At that time,
he presented with 10/10 crushing SSCP, found to have anterior
STEMI in ED.  Cath showed occluded LAD, and then received BMS x2
to LAD on [**5-19**].  After the cath lab during that admission, he
had persistent chest pain and he was taken back to the cath lab.
 Stents were intact, but he had distal LAD disease, so had 2nd
BMS placed.  Patient was also found to have HITT and an LV
thrombus during that admission.  He was started on Coumadin.
Although he used cocaine in the past, he denies any use since
his recent discharge.

Since his discharge from [**Hospital1 2025**], his activity has been limited by
fatigue and DOE.  He sleeps sitting in recliner.  Today, he had
a previously scheduled visit with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at
[**Location (un) 2274**] [**Location (un) **].  Patient was complaining of chest pain at the
time, and given his LV aneurysm and fixed ST elevations in
V1-V5, patient was transferred directly to the cath lab at
[**Hospital1 18**].

In the cath lab, patient was found to have:
1.  Single vessel coronary artery disease (occlusion of the
superior branch of OMB1)
2.  Patent stents in the proximal and mid LAD

He did not require any intervention. He continued to have some
chest pain during the procedure.  He was maintained on ASA,
plavix and discharged home after the procedure.

After leaving the hospital, the patient had dinner in [**Hospital1 8**].
 He had a small amount of broth, but then developed nausea, left
arm discomfort, and chest discomfort similar to other episodes,
and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the ED, his initial VS were T 36.8 ??????C, P: 105, RR: 34, BP:
123/86, O2Sat: 97, O2Flow: RA. He was diaphoretic, with dynamic
electrocardiogram changes in anterior precordial leads, with Q
waves. CODE STEMI was called. He was seen by cardiology. His
symptoms were thought to be consistent with increasing wall
tension with tachycardia. He already received aspirin 325 mg po.
In the ED, he recieved morphine, SL nitro. Initial plan was for
ED observation. He then developed an episode of shortness of
breath with O2 sat 86% and was found to have bibasilar rales and
CXR c/w pulmonary edema. He was initially started on NRB but
then started on BIPAP as patient's O2 sat remained in 80s on
NRB. He was also given 20 mg iv lasix. VS prior to transfer were
P: 91, RR: 21, BP: 117/92, O2Sat: 100, O2Flow: BiAP, 40% with 10
PEEP.

On arrival to the MICU, he reported improvement of his symtpoms,
and BiPAP was discontinued.

PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS [**2139-6-5**]:
[**2139-6-5**] Coronary angiography - right-dominant system with a ramus

intermedius branch:
- the left main has no flow-limiting stenosis
- the left anterior descending artery has widely-patent stents
in the
proximal and distal segments with 40-50% residual distal
stenosis and
mildly reduced flow (TIMI-2 to TIMI-3) throughout
- the stent-jailed D1 branch has 50% pinch at its origin,
unchanged
from prior two catheterizations
- the ramus intermedius branch has diffuse moderate stenosis and
has
total occlusion of one of its sub-branches, which is
collateralized
left-to-left (unchanged from prior catheterizations)
- the left circumflex artery has minor luminal irregularities
- the right coronary artery has diffuse 30-40% mid-vessel
stenosis
Cath [**2139-6-19**]
Coronary angiography: right dominant
LMCA: Normal
LAD: Stents are patent in the proximal and mid LAD; 40-50%
mid LAD after stent
LCX: Diffusely disease OMB1 with occlusion of the superior
limb of the OMB1 with left to left collaterals. There was a 40%

distal LCx
RCA: 40-50% mid RCA stenosis
The coronary anatomy is unchanged from the prior cardiac
catheterization report from the [**Hospital1 2025**] in early [**Month (only) 116**]. There was no
evidence of an acute embolus.

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with distal LV/apical dyskinesis and septal/anterior
hypokinesis to akinesis suggestive of CAD (LAD infarct?). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with mild mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

EKG: [**2139-6-19**] 19:11 sinus at 99, P wave abnormality, T wave
inversion in aVL, Q waves in V
