Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2182-5-2**]
1. Aortic valve replacement with a 23-mm On-X mechanical
    valve.
2. Full biatrial Maze procedure using a combination of the
    [**Company 1543**] Gemini irrigated bipolar RF device as well as

History of Present Illness:
This 56 year old woman with a known bicuspid aortic valve and
aortic insufficiency is followed by echocardiograms. She
developed atrial fibrillation in the fall of [**2179**] and started on
Coumadin. During recent retinal surgery she developedpulmonary
edema, and was admitted and treated with diuretics. A
follow-up echocardiogram in [**2182-2-18**] revealed a significant
drop in her ejection fraction from 55% to 25% with at least
moderate aortic insufficiency. She is now admitted for cardiac
catheterization to assess for coronary disease
and Heparin in preparation for valve surgery.

Pertinent Results:
Intra-op Echo [**2182-5-2**]
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30%). The righjt ventricle
displays severe global free wall hypokinesis. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve is functionally
bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.5 cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is atrially paced and is receiving
epinephrine by infusion. Right ventricular free wall systolic
function is improved - now with mild to moderate global
hypokinesis. The left ventricle also displays improved global
function - now also with mild to moderate global hypokinesis an
an EF of about 40%. There is a bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. It appears well seated. There are only limited views
of the leaflets and they do appear to display normal mobility.
There is trace valvular aortic regurgitation which is normal for
this prosthesis. The peak gradient across the aortic valve is
31mm Hg with a mean gradient of 133 mmHg at a cardiac output of
7 liters/minute. The effective orifice area of the valve is
approximately 1.9 cm2. There is trace mitral regurgitation. The
tricuspid regurgitation appears improved - now likeky mild to
moderate.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital after catheterization
and started on Heparin.  The patient noted some vaginal bleeding
following administration of Heparin.  She is 4 years
post-menopausal.  An Ob/Gyn consult was called.  Bleeding
ceased, and after evaluation, no further intervention was
indicated.

She was brought to the Operating Room on [**2182-5-2**] where she
underwent aortic valve replacement (23mm On-X valve), MAZE and
left atrial appendage ligation.  Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring
on Epinephrine and Propofol infusions.  Vancomycin &
Ciprofloxacin was used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis,
given the patient's pre-operative stay.  Of note, the patient's
left antecubital IV infiltrated and she extravasated
approximately 300cc of cell-[**Doctor Last Name 10105**] blood into the right upper
extremity.  Hand surgery was consulted.  She did not have
compartment syndrome, and no further intervention was warranted.


POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor
support.  She remained in atrial fibrillation, and an EP consult
was obtained.  Amiodarone was continued.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward her
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.

Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was e
