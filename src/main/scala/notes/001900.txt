History of Present Illness:
55 yo female with metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary
on C2D1 gemcitabine/irinotecan and with history DVT/PE with IVC
filter placement, history of malignant pleural and pericardial
effusions who presents with 2 days worsening shortness of breath
and orthopnea. She also reports right sided pleuritic chest
pain. She endorses new lower extremity edema for past 2 days.

Of note, she has had had 3 recent admissions: on [**5-16**] for dyspnea
and [**6-6**] and [**6-14**] for dizziness/syncope. On admission [**6-6**], the
patient had pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy with
removal of 520 cc of bloody fluid. [**Month/Year (2) **] on [**6-4**] showed stable
loculated pericardial effusion. [**Month/Year (2) **] [**6-11**] (EF>55%) suggestive of
pericardial constriction, although unchanged in size since prior
admission.
.
Pt. presented to ED with above complaints, and also found to be
tachycardic to 130s. Patient has h/o resting tachycardia
115-120. Electrocardiogram in the ED showed sinus tachycardia
unchanged from prior. In the ED, patient was seen by cardiology
given history of pericardial effusions and bedsided
echocardiogram was performed, and showed moderate effusion but
did not reveal any RV diastolic collapse or significant AV
respirophasic variation to suggest tamponade physiology. Chest
x-ray demonstrated re-accumulated large right-sided pleural
effusion and moderate left-sided effusion. Patient was admitted
due to tachypnea, tachycardia, and difficult course with
previous thoracentesis, which was complicated by post-procedure
pulmonary oedema requiring diuresis.
.
She has is s/p b/l thoracentesis and is now being considered for
pleurx catheter placement on Monday.
.
Currently, she is with mild SOB, pain controlled, no other
complaints

Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary
with malignant pleural effusions and constrictive pericardial
effusions s/p thoracocentesis with reaccumulation of effusions,
admitted for pleurx catheter placement
.
1. Respiratory distress - Secondary to R-sided malignant
effusion. s/p therapeutic thoracentesis [**8-1**].  SOB was only
transiently relieved by thoracentesis. Pleurx catheter was felt
to be a better plan than pleurodesis as SIRS reaction could
complicate pleurodesis.  Pt received her pelurx catheter
placement on [**8-6**] without complications.  Pt tolerated the
procedure well and with symptomatic improvement of her dyspnea.

.
2. Constrictive pericardial effusions: [**Month/Year (2) **] [**7-31**] showed chronic
effusion but without tamponade physiology.  Pt was seen by
cardiology with recommendations for potential procedure in the
future, but no immediate intervention was thought to be
warranted.  Pt was hemodynamically stable throughout admission.
.
3. Mucinous adenocarcinoma of unknown primary: The patient began
chemotherapy on [**2181-6-15**] with Gemzar and CPT-11 for metastatic
disease of unknown primary.  Pt was discharged with follow up
appointment with her primary oncologist for resumption of
chemotherapy.
.
4. UTI: Pt was found to have a UTI on admission.  She was
discharged with a 10 day course of ciprofloxacin.
