Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5167**]
Chief Complaint:
called to evaluate for altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation, now extubated

History of Present Illness:
77 year-old woman with PMH of L internal carotid aneurysm,
complex partial seizures, currently weaning off dilantin who
presented with disorientation, not following commands or
recognizing people and wandering around; now s/p intubation.

Family reports that pt has a hx of seizures for about 15 years,
on dilantin. She has never had GTC seizures. Her seizures are
characterized by confusion, not following commands. Because she
has been seizure-free for the last 7 years she was started on a
dilantin wean recently and family thinks she might not be taking
her meds any more.

Pt was well until around 3:30 am; she was working as a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Hospital3 2558**] when she suddenly became disoriented, wondering
around, would not respond to questions or recognize her
colleagues. There is no hx of weakness. Family reports that her
seizures in the past have had similar presentations.

She was brought to ED where she was moving all extremities
symmetrically with eyes open, not following commands. As she was
too agitated for brain imaging, she was intubated and started on
propofol. Family thinks it was about an hour between initiation
of symptoms and intubation. She received zosyn and vancomycin. A
head CT showed previous aneurysm but no acute process. Family
denies any recent illness.



ROS:
Family denies that pt had visual difficulty, hearing changes,
difficulty speaking, language problems, memory difficulty,
difficulty swallowing, vertigo, unsteady gait, paresthesias,
sensory loss,weakness, or falls.

The patient denied fever, wt loss, appetite changes, cp,
palpitations, DOE, sob, cough, wheeze, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, abd pain, fecal incont, dysuria,
nocturia, urinary incontinence, muscle or joint pain, hot/cold
intolerance, polyuria, polydipsia, easy bruising, depression,
anxiety, stress, or psychotic sx.

EEG [**2168-7-10**]
IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no
pushbutton
activations. No electrographic seizures or interictal
epileptiform
discharges were seen. The background was slow and disorganized
throughout the recording, suggestive of a moderate
encephalopathy, and
some superimposed leftsided slowing suggested subcortical
dysfunction in
that region.

EEG [**2168-7-11**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal non-continuous extended routine
EEG due
to slowing and disorganization of the background with brief
bursts of
generalized slowing suggestive of a mild to moderate
encephalopathy.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infections are
common
causes. No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures
were seen
in this study. This study captured no pushbutton activations.

Wrist (left) x-ray [**2168-7-11**]
There is abnormal widening of the scapholunate interval
measuring 7 mm
consistent with SL ligament rupture. There are also degenerative
changes
involving the radioscaphoid joint and of the first CMC joint.
There is mild generalized demineralization. No acute fractures
or dislocations are seen. There is mild swelling about the soft
tissues of the wrist.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to neurology ICU for evaluation and
management of seizures. She was closely monitered and underwent
frequent neuro checks.

Hospital Course;

Neuro
