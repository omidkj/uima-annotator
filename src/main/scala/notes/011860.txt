Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
jaw pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**7-15**]


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ PMH of AS, AF p/w inferior MI from OSH for cath. Pt.
awoke at 0500 on friday and walked to the bathroom. She walked
back to bed and then began noticing jaw pain and mild heartburn.
She took some xantac which did not relieve the pain and then
decided to call 911, but was unable [**1-15**] inability to see the
buttons on the phone. She called 611 and 411 and then decided to
call a friend who called EMS. EMS arrived and intial EKG showed
1mm STE's in II, III, aVF and STD's in aVL. She was taken to
[**Hospital3 4107**] where ekg showed resolution of STE's, her chest
pain continued and she was treated with nitro. Her chest pain
resolved around 1200. She was admitted to the ICU for pulmonary
edema and successfully diuresed. She initially refused cath, but
then her niece was talked her into having the procedure. She
remained pain free until 0200 on [**7-14**] when she again had jaw pain
and shortness of breath. She was treated with nitro and lasix
and her pain improved after about 1 hour. Her CK peaked at 860
w/ Trop of 16 on [**7-13**], BNP was 278. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac catheterization.

She states that over the past several months she has had
progressive DOE, stating that she has had to stop on her way to
the trash room. She has also noticed a general sense of fatigue
and daytime somnolence over the past month.
.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Cardiac cath [**7-15**]:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD had heavy
calcifications with
80% stenoses between two aneurysmal segments in the mid-vessel.
The LCX
was occluded in the distal vessel.  The LPL branches filled
faintly by
left-to-left collaterals.  The RCA had a distal 90% stenosis
prior to
the bifurcation of the PDA.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with a RVEDP of 25 mmHg and a LVEDP of 28 mmHg.  There
was
severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of
61/31 mmHg.
There was moderate systemic arterial hypertension with a central
aortic
pressure of 163/79 mmHg.  The cardiac index was normal at 2.7
L/min/m2.
The mean gradient across the aortic valve was 16 mmHg.  The
calculated
[**Location (un) 109**] was 1.1 cm2.
3. Successful PTCA and placement of overlapping
(proximal-to-distal)
3.0x23mm Vision, 3.0x18mm Driver, and 2.5x12mm Micro Driver
bare-metal
stents were performed in the mid-distal RCA.  Final angiography
showed
normal flow, resolution of the dissection, and no residual
stenosis.
(See PTCA comments.)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Moderate systemic arterial hypertension.
5. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
6. Placement of bare-metal stents in the mid-distal RCA.

ECHO [**7-16**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with PMH of moderate AS and atrial
fibrillation p/w inferior STEMI from OSH, had cardiac
catheterization [**7-15**] with 3 bare metal stents placed in the mid
RCA.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient initially with STEs on ekg by EMS, but
they resolved upon arrival.  She only had one episode of jaw
pain the morning of transfer prior to her catheterization.
Catheterization on [**7-15**] revealed three vessel coronary artery
disease, moderate aortic stenosis, severe pulmonary arterial
hypertension, moderate systemic arterial hypertension, and
biventricular diastolic dysfunction.  Three bare metal stents
were placed in the mid-distal RCA. She tolerated the procedure
well.  The patient is likely not a candidate for CABG given her
age.  She will continue her home ASA and was started on Plavix
and Lipitor.  She did not have any more jaw pain at rest or with
