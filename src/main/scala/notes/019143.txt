CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nonhealing ischemic right heel ulceration.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88-year-old gentleman
with known peripheral vascular disease who underwent a right
fem to AK [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass graft with PTFE for claudication in
[**2113-2-18**]. The patient's graft thrombosed and he
underwent thrombectomy with graft revision, femoral to AT
bypass, in [**2113-12-21**]. Follow-up duplex after this surgery
showed distal graft stenosis. The patient underwent AVD jump
graft from the fem AT graft to the distal AT with nonreversed
greater saphenous vein in [**2114-12-22**]. The patient returns
now for a diagnostic arteriogram secondary to right foot rest
pain and chronic nonhealing ulcers on the right heel. The
patient is admitted postarteriogram for vascular monitoring,
hydration, and elective bypass surgery. The arteriogram
demonstrated right renal artery was single. The left renal
artery was a duplicate with stenosis of the superior artery.
The left iliac common was stenosed 50 percent. The right and
left external/internal iliacs were patent. The right common
femoral was occluded but reconstructed by the right internal
iliac artery by collaterals. The femoral and popliteal
arteries were occluded with collateralization of the anterior
tibial by the anterior tibial. The tibial peroneal trunk was
diseased. The posterior tibial peritoneal were occluded. The
anterior tibial perfused the dorsalis pedis which was patent.
The peroneal fills distally by collaterals. The plantars were
diseased.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for stroke, shortness of breath,
dyspnea on exertion, PND, peptic ulcer disease, bowel
changes, gallbladder or liver disease, back pain, renal
stones. He does have a history of arrhythmia as he is status
post pacemaker/AICD for type 2 AV block/Wenckebach. Also
history of angina described as chest pressure, last episode
was 2 months ago relieved with a singular nitroglycerin.
Frequency is infrequent. The patient is also hard of hearing,
left greater than right.

ALLERGIES:  Contrast causes hives.

1.  Folic acid 1 mg a day.
2.  Mirtazapine 15 mg [**12-23**] tablet at bedtime.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with a daughter. [**Name (NI) **] denies
tobacco or alcohol use.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction,
    remote, with an EF of 20 percent.
2.  History of hypertension.
3.  History of secondary AV block with Wenckebach phenomena,
    status post AIC pacemaker.
4.  History of hyperlipidemia.
5.  History of bilateral renal artery stenosis by
    arteriogram.
6.  History of depression.
7.  History of chronic anemia.
8.  History of congestive heart failure compensated.
9.  Questionable history of CVA as recorded in the previous
    hospital documents, the patient denies or recalls having
    a CVA.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were stable. He is
generally oriented x 3, extremely hard of hearing. HEENT:
Bilateral carotid bruits. No JVD. No thyromegaly. Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Irregular rhythm
with extra beats. There was no murmur, gallop, or rubs.
Abdomen: Unremarkable. Without bruits or masses. Peripheral
vascular exam: Right foot rubrous toes x 5. The right heel is
a small pinpoint area of dry gangrenous changes. Office exam
shows palpable radials bilaterally. Femoral on the right is
Dopplerable signal only. On the left is palpable 2 plus. The
right popliteal is absent. The left popliteal is 1 plus
palpable. The DP and PT are monophasic on the right. The
graft is monophasic on the right. The DP and PT on the left
are biphasic Dopplerable signals. Left groin is clean, dry,
and intact without hematoma. Neurological exam shows oriented
x 3 with a mild left foot drop.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted post angio to the
vascular service and was prepared for surgery. He had a
carotid ultrasound done which showed right internal carotid
had 40-59 percent stenosis. The left less than 40 percent
stenosis with patent vein studies. The left greater saphenous
was patent as well as the left basilic and cephalic vein. The
patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed an ejection
fraction of 40 percent with mild level ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricle showed hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size was borderline and dilated. The
overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed with an EF of 25 percent. The resting regional wall
abnormalities include an inferior, inferolateral akinesis
with hypokinesis and akinesis elsewhere. There was no LV
thrombus, right-sided [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] were normal. The aortic root
was mildly dilated. The ascending aorta was mildly dilated.
Aortic valves were trileaflet with mild thickening. There was
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurg. Mitral valve leaflets
were mildly thickened with mild mitral regurg of [**12-23**] plus.
The tricuspid valves were mildly thickened with moderate
tricuspid regurg. There was mild pulmonary systolic
hypertension.

The patient proceeded to surgery on [**2116-3-24**] and
underwent a right femoral artery endarterectomy and a right
fem to AT bypass graft with PTFE. He tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition
where he developed decreased urinary output and the right
groin dressing was saturated. The patient's heart rate was
68, blood pressure 155/70. PA pressures were 35/20, CVP 6.
The 02 sat was 100 percent on 3 liters. The patient was given
a liter bolus with improvement in his urinary output. He
returns to surgery for evacuation of a groin hematoma with
ligation of a vein branch bleeder. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was returned to the PACU in stable
condition. He remained hemodynamically stable. His dressings
remained dry and intact and he had a Dopplerable palpable DP.
His hematocrit was 39.1. The patient continued to do well
from a hemodynamic standpoint with borderline urinary output
and he was transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring
and care. IV heparinization was started at 500 units per
hour.

Postoperative day number 1 was marked with overnight
confusion requiring a sitter for the patient. IV fluids were
Hep-locked. He was maintained on a heparin drip.
Anticoagulation with Coumadin 5 mg was instituted. His diet
was advanced as tolerated. His fluids were Hep-locked. He
remained in the VICU.

On postoperative day #2 there were no overnight events. He
was afebrile. Ambulation was begun. Physical therapy was
requested to see the patient and assist with discharge
planning. The patient will be discharged to home versus rehab
pending on physical therapy's assessment and when he is
medically stable.
