Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2117-9-23**]: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 88 year old male with multiple medical problems
including CAD s/p CABG in [**2099**], prostate cancer s/p xrt and HLD
presenting to the ED with abdominal pain. Patient has been in
the
ED for greater than 12 hours when our service was consulted. Per
preexisting reports by emergency department patient presented
with epigastric pain versus chest pain and was ruled out for an
MI. He continued to have back pain as well as epigastric pain
thus the CTA of the torso was obtained to rule out aortic
dissection. Patient underwent a non-contrast CT scan prior to
the
CTA. He continued to have some abdominal pain versus discomfort
and received a total of morphine IV 15 mg by the time ACS
surgery
was called to examine the patient.

At the time of our exam patient was very sleepy and minimally
engaged. He was difficult to arouse. He was able to answer
questions appropriately, but was unable to recall some history
information.

patient examined in the ED, very drowsy and difficult to wake
up,
keeps falling asleep during the interview and exam, has been
receiving morphine IV for multiple hours
RRR
CTA b/l
abdomen is soft, thin, minimally distended, tender in the RLQ
and
RUQ, minimal tympany, no rebound tenderness, no guarding


Pertinent Results:
[**2117-9-22**] CTA torso - No pulmonary embolism, acute aortic
process, or ischemic colitis. Distended gallbladder with small
pericholecystic fluid and cholelithiasis. This appearance may be
related to a third-spacing state, but given the suggestion of
hyperemia in the gallbladder fossa and a possible cystic duct
stone, symptoms should be correlated clinically. If indicated,
HIDA scan may be obtained for further evaluation. US may assess
for a possible cystic duct stone.
Large fecal load.  Increased displacement of left inferior and
superior pubic ramus fractures without significant interval bony
callus formation. Moderate-sized hiatal hernia


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13099**] is an 88M who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED complaining of
lower abdominal pain.  He was worked up for MI in the ED and
eventually underwent a CTA of his torso which demonstrated
possible cholecystitis.  He became increasingly tachycardic and
hypotensive during his ED course and was started on levophed
prior to admission to the MICU.  A right IJ was placed in the
ED.

After further evaluation, Mr. [**Known lastname 13099**] was taken to the OR for
laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which he tolerated without
difficulty.  He was admitted to the TSICU postoperatively for
hemodynamic monitoring given his initial decompensation in the
ED.

On [**9-23**], Mr. [**Known lastname 13099**] was noted to be increasingly hypercarbic and
had a significant respiratory acidosis, and was intubated.  He
required levophed with propofol, both of which were weaned off.
His ventillator support was weaned.

On [**9-24**] He was transferred to the floor and advanced to a
regular diet. On [**9-25**] his foley was discontinued and he voided.
His platelets were shown to be trending down at a nadir of 49 so
a HIT panel was sent, heparin was stopped and fondaparinux was
restarted. His antibiotics were also changed to po augmentin.
His Blood cultures grew back pansenstive Ecoli so we continued
him on that regimen. He was also shown to be fluid overloaded,
without respiratory compromise so we gave him 10 Iv lasix, which
he responded well. His home meds were also restarted. On [**9-26**] he
was dischrged home on PO augmentin.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with acute cholecystitis. You
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and
are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the
following instructions. During your stay, you received lasix for
fluid overload, as you had edema in your extremities and groin.
Please f/u with your PCP for further diuretic management.
Your platelets were trending down so we got a HIT panel which is
still pending. Your blood cultures grew Ecoli at admission so we
started you on Unasyn while you were here. You are being
discharged on Augmentin for 7days.
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic. You need to
call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11173**]
