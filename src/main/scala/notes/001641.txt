Radiology:
CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  There are no comparisons.  The cardiac
contour appears
enlarged.  There are low lung volumes.  No definite pulmonary
vascular
congestion, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  On the lateral
view, there
appears to be an opacity posteriorly, most likely in the left
lower lobe.

IMPRESSION:  Findings likely represent a left lower lobe
pneumonia

INDICATION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia, hypoxic, tachypneic,
tachycardic.
Please evaluate pulmonary embolus.

COMPARISONS:  None.

MDCT acquired axial images of the chest were acquired with and
without IV
contrast.  CT PE protocol.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no
evidence of
pulmonary embolism.  Evaluation beyond second order vessels is
limited by
atelectasis.  Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, with
associated
atelectasis/consolidation, worse on the left.

No pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
identified.  There
is evidence of atherosclerotic disease with calcification seen
within the
aorta as well as coronary vessels.

BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are
identified.
Degenerative changes, including loose body, seen in the right
shoulder.

Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the axial findings.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation with effusions,
worse on the left
side.  Findings consistent with pneumonia.
3.  Atherosclerotic disease with marked calcifications seen
within the aorta
and coronary vessels.

.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2148-3-22**]:  per report by radiology, bilateral renal
cysts; no evidence of renal abscess on CT scan.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for hypotension, hypoxia, and fevers.
He was initialyl admitted to the floor but was then shortly
transferred to the ICU for sepsis. He was found to have
urosepsis with pseudomonoas and was treated with Zosyn. He was
then transferred back to the floor and was gently diuresed.
.
#  Hypoxia: The patient was initially admitted with mild hypoxia
which quickly worsened with from fluid boluses for his
hypotension resulting in pulmonary edema. He was also thought to
have an pneumonia, though this was later thought to be
atlectasis. There was concern given his recent surgery and
hypoxia that he could have a PE, therefore a CT angio was
preformed which showed no evidence of PE. His flu DFA negative,
Legionella neg. ABG showed worsening respiratory alakalosis. At
his worst, he required 10 L NC to maintain his O2 Sats. He was
gently diuresed and on discharge, was no longer hypoxic. He may
need an echo as an outpaitent to evaluate for cardiomyopathy.

# Sepsis: The patient had pseuodomonal urosepsis likely related
to his recent prostate insturmentation. He was fluid recucxiteec
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and responded well to antibiotics. He will continue
a course of Zosyn for a total of 14 days ending on [**3-29**].

# Continued fevers: The patient continued to have low grade
temps after DC from the ICU. A fever workup ensued. He had
diarrhea which was cdiff neg x2 witn the 3rd pending, though he
was started on flagyl for emperic treatment. Ultrasound of his
kidneys showed a cyst vs. abscess, therefore a CTU wa
