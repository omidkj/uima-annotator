CXR: The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable, accounting
for
technique. No focal consolidation is detected within the lungs.
There is
little if any pulmonary edema. There is a small right pleural
effusion.
Diffuse osteopenia.
.
CT head:  No acute intracranial pathology including no
hemorrhage.

.
CXR [**1-26**]: Compared with [**2116-1-24**], there are slightly improved
inspiratory volumes.
Otherwise, no significant change is detected. Again seen is
linear but
somewhat patchy density at left base, with possible minimal
increased density
at the right base. No new infiltrates are identified. There is
minimal
blunting of the left costophrenic angle posteriorly. No gross
effusion. No
CHF. Background COPD again noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable.
Probable diffuse osteopenia. Small focus of pleural thickening
along the
right lower chest wall is again noted.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities, unchanged compared with [**2116-1-24**].

.
[**1-29**]: CT chest: FINDINGS: Several small, less than or equal to 5
mm diameter lung nodules are
without change from the prior examination, including a 5-mm
right lower lobe
nodule (151, 4) and several smaller nodules located in the right
middle lobe
(151, 4), lingula (153, 4), right middle lobe (41, 3) and left
lower lobe (34,
3). Apparent partial fat attenuation in the periphery of the
left lower lobe
(156, 4) is likely unchanged but is difficult to directly
compare due to a new
area of adjacent consolidation within the left lower lobe.
Streaky
peribronchovascular opacities are again demonstrated within the
posterior
segments of both lower lobes, and there are also new linear
opacities within
the right middle lobe and lingula. Previously reported
bronchiolitis pattern
in right lower lobe has resolved. Areas of bronchial wall
thickening persist
in the posterior segments of both lower lobes and are now
associated with
areas of peribronchiolar consolidation within the left lower
lobe. Upper
lobe-predominant emphysema, moderate in severity, is again
demonstrated.

No enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified.
Heart size is
normal. Small amount of pericardial fluid is slightly changed in
distribution
but unchanged in amount since the prior CT. A small hiatal
hernia is again
demonstrated. New trace left pleural effusion has developed.

Exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region,
but adrenal
glands are well visualized and normal in appearance. Remaining
imaged upper
abdomen is remarkable for previous cholecystectomy.

Skeletal structures are remarkable for healed right rib
fractures.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small noncalcified pulmonary nodules are unchanged.
Considering the
presence of emphysema, consider another followup CT scan in
approximately 12
months to confirm further stability.

2. New focal area of consolidation and atelectasis in left lower
lobe, which
may be related to the patient's recent reported COPD flare.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan
61F h/o COPD and CO2 retention, schizoaffective disorder
presents with hypercarbic resp failure. Improved with bipap,
steroids, abx, nebs.
.
# SOB: Likely COPD flare brought on by a URI. Originally
admitted to the ICU for Bipap because of hypercarbic respiratory
failure. In the ICU, treated with vanco, ceftazidime, and
azithromycin as well as IV MethylPREDNISolone.  Upon transfer to
the floor continud nebs, a slow prednisone taper, and a 5 day
course of Azithromycin. On transfer to the floor she was  stable
on 1 to 3L oxygen without SOB at rest. Given her  longstanding
COPD and h/o MS alteration with non-rebreather we aimed for goal
SaO2 between 88-92% with titration of oxygen. However, Ms.
[**Known lastname **] continued to desat to the low 80s with minimal
excertion, including up to the restroom. Upon discharge she will
continue a Prednisone taper (started at 60mg daily decreasing by
10mg eve
