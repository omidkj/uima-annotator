HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year-old
gentleman with recent revision of ventriculoperitoneal shunt
for development of chronic subdural hematoma.  The patient
was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2183-1-15**] on a heparin
drip and Coumadin for his St. Jude's valve.  The patient was
doing well at rehabilitation until the evening of [**2183-1-18**]
when he was noted to be decreased mental status and
lethargic.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation.

[**Hospital1 **] pressure was 193/62, heart rate 58, saturations 97
percents.  His eyes were closed and did not open to stimuli.
Responded to grimacing with limited verbal output.
Withdrawal of all extremities to pain, right greater than
left. Following commands in the right upper extremity,
squeezing, withdrawing bilateral lower extremities.  The
pupils 3 to 2 mm and reactive.  Face was symmetric.  The
incision was clean, dry and intact.

A CT showed a large right interparenchymal hemorrhage with
clot casting the right lateral third ventricle and extending
into the left lateral ventricle with acute hemorrhage in the
chronic subdural hematoma which was larger than when he was
discharged.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit and a vent drain placed at the bedside.  The
patient was monitored with q1 hour neural checks.  He was
opening his eyes to void, oriented to name, [**Month (only) 1096**] and
[**2178**].  The patient had a left facial droop.  Grips were full
bilaterally and his IPA's were full.

The patient was seen by cardiology in regards to his St. Jude
valve and anticoagulation.  The patient was taken off
anticoagulation and cardiology recommended restarting it as
soon as possible when safe from a neurologic standpoint.  The
patient was restarted on Coumadin on [**2183-2-3**].

On [**2183-1-22**] the patient was awake, alert and extraocular
motions were full.  The patient continued to have a left
facial droop.  Grasps were full bilaterally.  His IP's were
antigravity.  The patient had some difficulty following
commands.  The patient remained neurological stable and his
drain was increased to 15 cm above the tragus.  The patient
was transfused with two units of packed cells for a
hematocrit of 25.3.  His mental status deteriorated with a
drain at 15 cm above.  The drain was put back down to 10 cm
above the tragus.

The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2183-1-22**] that showed
dilated left atrium and an ejection fraction of less than 20
percent.  CT on [**2183-1-22**] showed decrease in the amount of
hemorrhage in the ventricles.  The size of the ventricles was
decreased.  On [**2183-1-25**] a vent drain was titrated to keep the
drain output 10 to 15 cc an hour.  The patient's mental
status improved.

A head CT on [**2183-1-23**] showed no interval change.  On [**2183-1-28**]
the patient was awake and conversing and squeezing on the
right, withdrawing his lower extremities bilaterally.  Chest
x-ray on [**2183-1-28**] showed left lower lobe pleural effusion.
On [**2183-1-31**] the vent drain was clamped.  The patient
continued to require q1 hour neural checks.  The patient
tolerated having the vent drain clamped and it was
discontinued on [**2183-2-1**].  The patient was neurological
stable and was awake, alert and oriented times two.  The
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  The patient continued to have left facial
droop and left drift.  His strength on the right side was
[**6-10**].

The patient was followed by physical therapy and occupational
therapy and found to require acute rehabilitation prior to
discharge to home.  His vital signs were stable.  The patient
was neurologically awake, alert and oriented times two with
continued right sided weakness with the left side moving
spontaneously and strongly.  Vent drain stitch will be
removed in five days on [**2183-2-9**].  The patient was tolerating a
diabetic soft diet with thickened liquids.  The patient's
condition was stable at the time of discharge.  The patient
will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in two weeks for a repeat head CT.
Should continue on Coumadin 10 mg p.o. day to keep his INR
2.5 to 3.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 150 mg p.o. t.i.d., hold
for systolic [**First Name (STitle) **] pressure less than 110, heart rate less
than 60.  Captopril 75 mg p.o. t.i.d, hold for systolic [**First Name (STitle) **]
pressure of less than 110.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q day, Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4 hours
p.r.n., Famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d., Insulin sliding scale
both fixed and sliding scale. Fixed is NPH 18 units in the
morning and 14 units at bedtime covered by sliding scale.
Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q day.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. q
day.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q12 hours.

CONDITION:  The patient's condition is stable.


FOLLOW UP:  The patient tolerated the procedure well is to
follow up  with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in two weeks with repeat head CT.
