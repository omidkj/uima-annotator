Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
Direct Admit from Hepatology Outpatient Office: Hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 44 yo F with PMH significant for alcoholic
cirrhosis who was at Dr.[**Name (NI) 948**] office today for routine
evaluation and was noted to have BP ~80s/40s.

Per the patient's husband, she was in her usual state of health
until approximately 2 years ago when she attempted to stop
drinking for a family function. Within a few days of stopping
drinking (previously she drank [**11-21**] pints gin/vodka / day) she
had a seizure and was brought to the hospital. It was during
that time, that she was told she had liver disease from alcohol.
She tried to stop drinking but was unable to secondary to
increased life stressors. She started and stopped drinking [**1-21**]
times and each time she stopped she had a seizure. Her liver
disease was well compensated until [**Month (only) 205**]-[**2100-6-20**] when she
noted increased ankle swelling and increased abdominal girth and
jaundice. At that time an EGD was done which was notable for
large, portal gastropathy, nonbleeding varices. She was started
on atenolol, lasix and spironolactone. She stopped drinking
after that hospitalization. Per her husband, she has remained
weak, confused, and only intermittently lucent over the past few
months. Her atenolol was changed to nadolol ~1 month ago for
unclear reasons per her husband. [**Name (NI) **] notes that she has been
"yellow" for more than a month. They report a >10 pound weight
loss in the last few months despite the patient attempting to
eat (she drinks boost tid). They deny fevers, chills, night
sweats.  They deny pruritis. She reports easy bruising/bleeding.
She had a fall secondary to instability in [**Month (only) 404**] during which
she hurt her back and continues to take tramadol. They deny
LOC/head trauma during the fall. The patient was seen at the
liver clinic last month and her bp was 85/60.

In the ED, the patient was given 3 Liters of IV NS.

osteoporosis at the Hip
3. Compression Fracture-[**2100-11-25**]
4. Chronic Alcoholism - no period of abstinence


Social History:
The patient lives with her husband. She does not have children.
She denies tobacco/IV drug use. She drank [**11-21**] pints vodka/gin
per day >15 years. She has not drank alcohol since [**6-23**]. She
used marijuana 3 years ago.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 5433**] was admitted with known cirrhosis, thought secondary
to chronic alcohol use, with hypotension and mild confusion. She
had a long complicated course, which included hypotension,
new-onset severe CHF (of unclear etiology) and worsening liver
failure. Given her poor prognosis and responses to therapy, the
goals of care were changed to comfort; the patient died
comfortably with her husband at her bedside. An autopsy was
requested by the family.

Again, Mrs. [**Known lastname 5433**] had a known history of cirrhosis/ESLD,
esophageal varices S/P hHemorrhage and banding ([**5-/2100**]), hepatic
encelphalopathy, active alcholism, idiopathic tachycardia who
was admitted with confusion and was found to be hypotensive,
tachycardic, and hyponatremic. She was admitted to the MICU.
Hemoptysis then ensued in her early course and an EGD and
intubation were pursued. She under went variceal banding with
success in regards to hemostasis. Her HCT nadired in the high
'teens' but responded to her banding procedure, along with PRBC
and IVF volume resucitation.

She then (late [**Month (only) 958**]) developed oliguria in conjunction with
increasing tachycardia and SVT/AF episodes. Over the proceeding
days, her UOP improved, but the tachycardia along with new AF
persisted. An extensive search for infection was not fruitful
(including HIV, blood, urine, peritoneal fluid and chest imaging
evaluation). A TTE showed marked lowering of the LVEF (from
>55%% to 25%). The etiology was unclear, but deemed to be either
tachycardia-induced, viral, or ischemic; as evaluated by the EP
Cards and CHF services. CEs and TSH were normal. She was started
on low-dose BB (Nadolol) and ACEi. She was eventually extubated.
She was called out to the floor but soon became hypotensive
(SBPs 70s-80s) with concominant redevelopment of oliguria. She
was transferred to the CCU ([**2101-2-27**]). Her BB and ACEi were
stopped and she was given pressor support. Cardiac
catheterization, biopsy or EP evaluations were not purused
during her course.

Given her dismal prognosis and poor responses to therapies,
goals of care were changed to comfort alone - after many family
discussions. She was given Morphine for respiratory comfort and
seemed peaceful and comfortable thereafter. Her husband remained
at her bedside and Mrs. [**Known lastname 5433**] passed away.
