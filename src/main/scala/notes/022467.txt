Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5167**]
Chief Complaint:
headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 yo R-handed woman with CAD, GERD,
sinusitis, emphesema who presented with HA to the ED on [**8-9**] and
was admitted to Medicine service [**8-9**] for sinusitis.

[**6-19**], the patient presented to the ED  with a severe headache.
At that time, a CT head was normal and the patient refused an
LP.
At follow up she did "complain of stuffy nose and pain behind
her
right eye like an ice pick. She states that she also has a
pressure in her sinuses bilaterally." At that point (early [**Month (only) **])
she was given a 10 day course of Augmentin, and her symptoms
improved somewhat. They did never completely resolve. She did
have photo- and phonophobia at that time, no muscle aches. She
had some neckpain (does not remember the details).

She returned to the ED [**8-9**] as her headache had been getting
worse over about 2 weeks. She said the onset was sudden, though
that may not fit with the story that her headache never really
went away. The headache became progressively worse. She was
evaluated in the ED and a CT head was normal except for
sinusitis
involving the sphenoid sinus (maxillary sinuses not in view).
She
was started on CTX and Unasyn. The patient refused an LP in the
ED. Neurology was not consulted and she was admitted to
Medicine.
The Medicine attending persuaded her to undergo an LP, which had
increased WBC (Lymphocytic predominant). She was emperically
started on vanco, ampicillin, CTX and acyclovir.

She has been having night sweats, and a chronic cough. No
weightloss. No rash or itching. No insect bites. No jaw
claudication, but does remember scalp tenderness upon touch. No
transient visual loss. This morning she noted some neckpain at
the right. She also noted that she would say the wrong words
occasionally and that she had difficulties thinking smoothly
(this morning). Also some nausea this morning.

About 10 years ago, she had similar headaches, fever and was
diagnosed with sinusitis. Followed by ENT, but last time she was
seen was 2.5 years ago.

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING

The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  Kappa, Lambda
and CD antigens 5, 19, 45.



RESULTS:



Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.

Majority of the cells are in the cell debris/lysed cell area.



A limited panel is performed to determine B cell clonality.
In the viable lymphoid gate, CD19 positive B-cells are extremely
scant (less than 1% of lymphoid gated events ) and clonality
cannot be reliably assessed.



CD5 positive T cells comprise 82% of lymphoid gate.



INTERPRETATION



Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile.

B-cell clonality could not be reliably assessed due to scant
numbers.

Correlation with clinical findings and morphology is
recommended. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may no
