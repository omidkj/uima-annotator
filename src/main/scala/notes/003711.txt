Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Vancomycin / Shellfish Derived

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
Non-productive cough, lethargy and 13 point drop in Hct, CXR
from PCP showed no acute process.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2186-12-14**] Endovascular repair of aortic psuedoaneurysm and
placement R renal stent for aortic graft leak.

[**2186-12-16**] Oral exploration and extraction of infected foreign body
and teeth #s 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.


History of Present Illness:
70 y-o gentleman presents as transfer from [**Hospital1 6687**] for
low HCT. The patient initially presented to his PCP today with [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
new non-productive cough and lethargy.  The PCP obtained [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CXR
that showed no acute process. During the patient's workup, the
patient's HCT was found to be 18.1. His baseline is low 30's,
and
the most recent documented HCT before today was 31 in 5/[**2186**].
Even though the patient had no complaints of abdominal pain or
vomiting, an NGT was placed in the patient in [**Hospital1 6687**] - lavage
was guaiac negative. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further eval, given his history of recent surgery at this
hospital.  On arrival the patient reports no chest pain or
abdominal pain. He has no leg pain and he says he walks around
with a cane without any cramps in his legs.  He occasionally
feels pain in his left foot when in bed at nighttime. He denies
any recent fevers or chills. His last BM was yesterday, and the
patient states there was no blood in his stool.  Of note, the
patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2186-2-10**] for melanotic stools -
UGI and colonoscopy obtained at the time were normal.  [**Year (4 digits) **]
surgery was consulted for potential aorto-enteric fistula in
this
patient, given his history of aorta repair and his seemingly
sudden drop in HCT. Of note, the patient received 2 units of
pRBCs prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

Cardiology:

ECG Study Date of [**2186-12-13**]  5:31:56 PM

Sinus bradycardia. Poor R wave progression. Lateral ST-T wave
changes
suggest myocardial ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2186-3-9**]
the lateral T wave inversions are new.

RADIOLOGY:

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-12-13**] 8:57
PM
Final Report: Comparison is made with a prior study from
[**2186-3-10**].

IMPRESSION:

Adequate position of right IJ and NG tubes.
Mild congestion with increased retrocardiac density which may
reflect
atelectasis or pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion.

CTA PELVIS W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2186-12-14**] 12:00 AM

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval development of a large amount of intraperitoneal
fluid measuring 10 Hounsfield units. Althouhg this could be
related to cirrhotic liver, differential diagnostic
consideration includes blood tracking into the peirtoneum from
the presumed retroperitoneal fluid (?blood) collection. The low
attenuation of the peritoneal fluid low may be due to patient's
anemia.
2. Low-density fluid collection along the left psoas muscle is
highly
suspicious for a retroperitoneal bleeding.
3. Abdomanial aortic thrombus at the superior aspect of the
graft.
The findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31549**] at the time of
interpretation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-12-14**] 8:24 PM

The patient was intubated in the meantime interval with the ET
tube tip being 6.5 cm above the carina. The right internal
jugular line tip is in distal SVC. The NG tube tip is in the
stomach. There is interval worsening of aeration of the left
lower lung and bilateral increase in pleural effusion. There is
no significant change in perihilar interstitial opacities most
likely representing pulmonary edema since they have been absent
on the study from [**2185-5-31**], and demonstrates fluctuating on
several subsequent radiographs including [**2186-3-10**]. the
appearance on [**2186-12-13**] study suggests acute origin of
the findings rather than chronic interstitial changes.
The aortic graft is noted in the abdomen.
