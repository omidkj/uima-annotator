History of Present Illness:
65 yo man with CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, metastatic poorly

CXR:
Multifocal bilateral parenchymal opacities are similar in
appearance to
previous studies, although there is slightly increased opacity
seen at the
left base. Most likely, these represent the patient's known
bilateral
metastatic disease, though it is difficult to exclude an
underlying pneumonia at the left base. There is no significant
pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Left basilar
atelectasis is slightly improved.

CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism. No aortic dissection.
2. Unchanged appearance of innumerable bilateral spiculated
pulmonary
nodules, most consistent with metastatic disease.
3. Unchanged appearance of low-attenuation foci within the
liver, which may
represent metastatic disease.
4. Unchanged appearance of multiple osseous metastatic lesions.

CT Head:
IMPRESSION: No enhancing mass lesions. Stable head CT
examination relative
to [**2198-1-21**] with no acute intracranial process.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 65 yo M with metastatic poorly differentiated CA which
likely NSLCA,
CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, recent cauda equina syndrome treated with
xrt and dexamethasone discharged [**4-5**] returned [**4-6**] with
hypotension, mental status change. No specific etiology was
identified for his deterioration, which was likely
multifactorial due to his widely metastatic cancer and multiple
medical co-morbitities. The patient, in his more lucid moments,
was clear that he did not want to return to rehab and would
prefer to go home with hospice care; however, owing to a complex
social situation at home and his family's different opinions of
whether they would be able to keep him comfortable at home, this
was not considered feasible.

While ongoing discussions with his partner, his two sons, and
various members of his extended family about possible
disposition plans that would allow him to leave the hospital
without returning to an extended care facility were underway,
the patient continued to worsen in terms of mental status and
respiratory status. His multifactorial hypotension precluded
intermittent HD, so this was discontinued. His respitory status
particularly worsened, with several likely aspiration events and
additionally several episodic oxygen desaturations unrelated to
obvious aspiration.

Since he had indicated his wish for hospice care, and the
palliative care team was following, he was not intubated for
this respiratory distress. His family was called and advised to
come to his bedside. He expired on [**2198-4-13**].
