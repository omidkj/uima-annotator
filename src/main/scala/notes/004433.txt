Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Palpitations and lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
59 year old female with sarcoidosis, LBBB (known for at least 3
years) presents with lightheadedness and palpitations that
lasted for 2 hours on day of admission. She went to OSH where
she was found to be in wide complex tachycardia. She was given
ASA 325 x 1. Apparently, she has been told she has a bundle
[**Last Name (un) **] block in the past, and it was felt she may be in SVT with
aberrancy. They gave her adenosine which broke her out of SVT
and back into sinus rhythm with left bundle, HR 80. She denies
any chest pain with this episode. She denies any fevers, chills.

.
She states very rarely, if she is startled awake from sleep, she
will experience palpitations that may last 10-15 minutes, but
this has only happened once in the past year.
.
She was evaluated by a cardiologist 3 years ago when she had
epigastric discomfort, later thought [**1-18**] to GERD.  She had a
normal exercise stress test.  Echocardiogram performed at OSH in
[**2127**] revealed EF of 40-45%.
.
She reports that she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis
approximately [**2123**] at which time she was found to have
hilar/mediastinal LAD.  It is not clear whether she has known
pulmonary involvment beyond this, but has been seen by
pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at [**Hospital1 **].
.
Following conversion of her tachyarrhythmia, she was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation by electrophysiology.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
97.8F HR 90 BP 128/79 RR 18 96%RA
Gen: awake, alert, pleasant, sitting up in bed, NAD
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, MMM
Neck: supple, no JVD
CV: Distant HS, normal S1, S2 without mrg, RRR
Pulm: CTAB, no w/r/r
Abd: Normoactive BS, soft, ND/NT
Ext: WWP, no edema


Pertinent Results:
[**12-3**] CXR: Symmetric interlobular septal thickening in bilateral
lower lobes. This can be due to chronic congestive heart
failure, however, there is no acute evidence of pulmonary edema
or acute failure. The possibility of underlying interstitial
lung disease cannot be totally excluded. Please correlate
clinically, especially with PFT.
.
[**12-5**] Cardiac MRI:
1. Severely dilated left ventricular cavity size with severe
global hypokinesis and focal inferior akinesis and mid-basal
septal akinesis/dyskinesis. The LVEF was severely depressed at
28%. The effective forward LVEF was severely depressed at 22%.
No MR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The RVEF
was normal at 59%. No MR evidence of right ventricular fatty
infiltration/dysplasia.
3. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild tricuspid
regurgitation.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was mildly increased.
5. There was a 1 cm lymph node in the supracarinal region.
Findings indicate an LV cardiomyopathy. (However, cannot exclude
ischemic etiology; coronary arteries were not assessed). The
findings were not suggestive of cardiac sarcoid, although this
diagnosis cannot be definitely excluded.
.
[**12-6**] Cardiac catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed no evidence of coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD,
LCX, and RCA had no flow-limting lesions. The LAD had a distal
myocardial brige.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed a normal PCPW of 8mmHg. Cardiac
index
was normal at 2.6l/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with a
calculated
ejection fraction of 23%.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old female with sarcoidosis and history of LBBB who
presented with palpitations, lightheadedness and wide complex
tachycardia.
.
# Arrhythmia:  Rhythm from OSH was reviewed by EP and appeared
most likely ventricular tachycardia as opposed to SVT with
aberrancy given a change in axis. She had one episode on the
floor at [**Hospital1 18**], associated with lightheadedness, self limited,
which also appeared consistent with VT.  Given her history of
sarcoidosis and LBBB, there was certainly concern for
infiltrative granulomatous cardiac disease.  A cardiac MRI was
obtained to further evaluate for evidence of cardiac sarcoid,
which revealed severe LV hypokinesis (EF 28%); however, was not
consistent with cardiac sarcoid.  Cardiac catheterization was
done which did not reveal evidence of coronary artery disease.
She had an electrophysiology study at which time she went into
complete heart block and she was transferred to the CCU with a
temp wire for further monitoring prior to device placement.  On
[**2131-12-7**], she had a permanent pacemaker and ICD placed.  She
tolerated the procedure well.  At the time of discharge, she was
[**Date Range 1988**] follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **] clinic, as well as
with the device clinic.
.
# Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction:  An echocardiogram was
obtained to evaluate her known LBBB which revealed global
hypokinesis with ejection fraction of [**9-30**]%.  She has never had
symptoms of heart failure, but was started on beta blocker and
ACEI for LV systolic dysfunction.  Cardiomyopathy workup
revealed normal thyroid function tests, normal iron studies, and
SPEP/UPEP.  As above, she underwent cardiac MRI to further
evaluate the possibility of cardiac sarcoid, which was not
consistent with this diagnosis.  She also underwent cardiac
catheterization which revealed normal coronary arteries.
.
# Sarcoidosis:  She was originally diagnosed in approximately
[**2123**] when she was found to have hilar/mediastinal LAD on
imaging.  She was on prednisone and methotrexate for years for
ocular involvement, having just discontinued both recently
within the last several months.
