Oxygen desaturation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 35227**] is a 77 year old female with a history of left
pontine stroke with residual right sided weakness and recent
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2109-5-8**] to [**2109-5-10**] who presents from
rehab with fever to 101 and desaturation to 89% on 2.5L NC at
rehab. She had a left lower lobe opacity on her CXR in our ED
and was started on hospital acquired pneumonia coverage,
receiving cefepime/levofloxacin in the ED and vancomycin when
she came up to the floor.
.
Her admission from 6/20/4/12 to [**2109-5-10**] was for hypoxemia. She
was treated empirically for heart failure with iv diuresis. She
was also treated for community acquired pneumonia at that time
and was discharged on levofloxacin, which she was to take
through [**2109-5-15**] at rehab. She was getting levofoxacin daily per
the NH records.
.
She has not had shaking chills or subjective fevers. She has a
stable productive cough that has persisted since her prior
admission.
.
In the ED 97.3 109 94/52 100% 15L Non-Rebreather. Above abx
given. Vitals on transfer: t 97, p98, 95/39 94% 6L NC.
Currently, she has no acute complaints.

Past Medical History:
- CVAs in [**2098**], with residual R-hand and arm weakness for 1 year
afterwards
- Left-sided progressive weakness
- Meningioma
- Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Currently at [**Hospital3 **] s/p stroke. Previously, lives
alone, independent in all iADLs and ADLs. Drank "beer from
morning to night" for 45 years, currently denies; Smoked 2-3ppd
x40-50 years, quit 10 years ago; denies illicits.

Family History:
daughter had NHL, now in remission x9yrs,  mother died
from breast ca, father from [**Name2 (NI) 499**] ca

IMAGING:
[**2109-5-13**] CXR: Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates
ill-defined opacity in the lateral right lung base, slightly
more conspicuous since [**2109-5-10**]. Similar opacities seen in the
left lung base, has progressed since prior. Prominence of
interstitial markings persists. Hilar and mediastinal
silhouettes are unremarkable. The descending aorta is mildly
tortuous. Heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
Healing remote left-sided rib fracture is noted.
IMPRESSION: Ill-defined opacities in bilateral lung bases, more
conspicuous since [**2109-5-10**] exam, could be atypical infection.
.
[**2109-5-13**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%) with normal regional
left ventricular wall motion. The estimated cardiac index is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is a very
small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function.
.
[**2109-5-13**] CT Chest w/o con:
1. Moderately severe emphysema with an inflammatory interstitial
component.
2. Scattered areas of alveolar opacification, have not worsened
since recent conventional radiographs, could have been due to
aspiration or no longer active infection.  Alternatively, if the
patient continues to smoke, the findings could be due to
desquamative interstitial pneumonia or drug reaction.
3. Widespread atherosclerosis, including large plaques in head
and neck vessels, left main coronary artery and branches, and
minimally aneurysmal upper abdominal aorta.
4. Diffuse esophageal wall thickening could be due to reflux or
other causes of esophagitis

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old female with a history of left pontine stroke with
residual right sided weakness and recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**2109-5-8**] to [**2109-5-10**] for ?CHF and pneumonia, who presents from
rehab with fever and hypoxia.
.
# Fever/Hypoxia: Patient had no fevers documented during this
admission. Her initial CXR showed diffuse interstitial
abnormalities bilaterally and a questionable right base opacity
suggesting pneumonia. We continued the levofloxacin which she
had been taking and added vancomycin/cefepime for possible HCAP.
A CT chest showed moderately severe emphysema with an
inflammatory interstitial component, also scattered areas of
alveolar opacification which could be due to desquamative
interstitial pneumonia or drug reaction. Given this, and her
lack of fevers/leukocytosis, and lack of improvement on the
levofloxacin, this was felt unlikely to be a bacterial pneumonia
so the antibiotics were stopped on [**5-14**]. A respiratory viral
swab was ordered and a bronch was done with BAL, which did not
grow any organisms and revealed pale airways suggesting an
interstitial process. The cell differential on the bronchoscopy
indicated a possible inflammatory process such as AIP. She was
started on methylprednisolone 1000mg daily for 3 days (day one
recieved in the MICU on [**5-17**]) and will require a slow taper over
the period of a month if her shortness of breath is improving.
.
# H/o left pontine stroke: Patient has residual right upper and
lower extremity weakness which remained stable with no new focal
findings on neuro exam. We continued aspirin 325mg and
atorvastatin 80mg.
.
# Right frontotemporal mass: Likely meningioma. Stable neuro
exam. Continued keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin.
.
# Restless Leg Syndrome: Continued carbidopa-levodopa.

# Goals of care: Ms. [**Known lastname 35227**] and her family are currently
leaning towards comfort focused care going further. They were
amenable to PICC placement for IV steroids in case this will
improve Ms. [**Known lastname 111944**] respiratory symptoms, but overall are
interested in measures to make Ms. [**Known lastname 35227**] more comfortable.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] from palliative care worked with the patient and her
family while she was here, and will email the palliative care
department at her skilled nursing facility to update them as to
her progress. It may prudent to transition to comfort measures
only in the coming days depending on her response to steroids.

Transitional Issues:
- Ms. [**Known lastname 35227**] was started on IV methylprednisolone 1gm x 3
days(day 1 [**5-17**]), and she will start prednisone 60mg daily on
[**2109-5-19**]. She will likely need a long (1 month) taper to be
predicated by her respiratory response to the steroids.
- Goals of care will need to be re-addressed pending the
response to the steroids. The family is currently amenable to
com
