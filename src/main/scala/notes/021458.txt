Pertinent Results:
[**2114-2-19**] Echo: PRE-CPB: Poor image quality. The left atrium is
markedly dilated. In limited views of LAA, there is no apparent
thrombus is seen. A patent foramen ovale is present with left to
right shunt. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15-20 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened with focal calcifications. There is no AS. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: The LV remains mildly hypertrophied and moderately
dilated with severely depressed EF, estimated at 15-20%. The
interatrial septum is hypermobile, but no shunt is seen at rest.
There is no dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1391**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up prior to admission. On [**2-18**] he was taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.

Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one,
beta-blockade, diuretics and aspirin were started and he was
gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. [**Last Name (un) **] followed
patient post-op regarding diabetes and insulin pump management.
On post-op day two he chest tubes were removed and he was
transferred to the stepdown unit for further care. Epicardial
pacing wires were removed on post-op day three.

He continued to make good progress while working with physical
therapy for strength and mobility during his post-op course. He
had an acute flare of gout for which the rheumatology service
was consulted. His uric acid level was noted to be 11.
Colchicine was started with some improvement of his symptoms
along with a single dose of intravenous Solumedrol.
Arthocentesis of his right wrist was performed by the orthopedic
service however no fluid was obtained. Maintenance colchicine
was recommended after resolution of his acute flare.

On post-op day eight he was discharged to home with VNA services
and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
