CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2125-3-18**] 11:12 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman with s/p maze
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
EXAMINATION: PA and lateral chest.

INDICATION: Status post maze.

PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained on [**2125-3-18**] at
11:16 hours and compared with the prior radiograph performed
[**2125-3-15**] at 21:01 hours. The lung volumes have improved since the
prior examination. Bibasilar atelectasis, however, persists.
There is mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle on both
the AP and lateral views, consistent with small left pleural
effusion. Right-sided IJ line is unchanged with its tip
projected over the proximal SVC. Mild pulmonary vascular
congestion is unchanged.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No LA mass/thrombus (best
excluded by TEE).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending
aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality (no apical or subcostal windows), a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Transmitral Doppler could not be
assess due to absence of apical windows, but there appears to be
atrial mechanical function on M-mode of the mitral leaflets.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Trace aortic regurgitation.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2123**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to cardiac surgery in preparation for surgery.
She was seen by neurology and underwent MRA brain. Chest CT was
done to evaluated her coronaries. She was started on IV heparin
as she stopped her coumadin preoperatively. She was taken to the
operating room on [**2125-3-14**] where she underwent a bilateral
thoracoscopic MAZE and LAA resection. She was transferred to the
ICU in stable condition. She had bilateral subcutaneous pain
pumps. She was extubated in the OR but was reintubated for
agitation. She was again extubated on POD #1. Her pain pumps and
chest tubes were dc'd. She had intermittent rapid atrial
fibrillation and was restarted on amiodarone and coumadin. She
was seen by electrophysiology for difficult rate control. She
was transferred to the floor on POD #3. She was followed closely
by electrophysiology and her medications were adjusted. Echo on
[**3-19**] showed no pericardial effusion and she was ready for
discharge home.
