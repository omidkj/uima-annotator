Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3419**] is a 47 y/o woman with a hx of colitis and SVTs who was
admitted for septic meningitis on [**2127-7-24**]. She developed a
gradually worsening cough and dyspnea, with CXRs showing
worsening diffuse alveolar opaceification, as well as persistant
fevers. She was bronched on [**8-3**], after which the pt developed
tachypnea to the 40s with dropping O2 sats despite increasing O2
requirements. She was transferred to the MICU for respiratory
distress and was started on cefepime, flagyl, and doxycycline.
In the MICU, her problems were as follows:
.
# Respiratory Distress:  Pt was febrile, tachypnic, leukemic,
and hypoxemic when transferred to the MICU. She was shown to
have pleural effusions. Her antibiotic regiment was broadened to
include vanc and meropenem. She became increasingly
hemodynamically unstable and her WBCs increased, and her CXR
showed expanding diffuse opacities. Fungal coverage was
initiated due to the patient's lack of improvement on other
antibiotics.  On the morning of [**8-5**], the pt was intubated for
respiratory distress. Her pressures decreased to MAPs in the
50s, which led to the initiating of pressors. CXR showed
progressive upper [**Last Name (un) 8490**] predominant disease. An A-line was
placed. Ms. [**Known lastname 3419**] has a repeat bronch on [**8-5**] and many labs were
sent. Her CT showed moltifocal PNA vs vasculitis & ARDS. That
night, pt had 3 runs of SVT, as evidenced by ECGs. She was
converted with B-blockers and stabilized on amiodarone.
Solumedrol was initiated for wheezing, possible vasculitis. This
was switched to methylprednosone. On [**8-7**], pt was still febrile,
intubated, with episodes of hypotension, but off pressers. She
was started on acyclovir.

Pt is in ARDS suspecte
