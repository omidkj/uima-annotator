Wounds in tact (anterior approach performed by vascular and
posterior approach performed by spine). wbc elevated to 24.6
(10.1 on [**9-4**]). Cr elevated to 2.1 (1.1 prior to d/c [**9-4**] and 1.5
[**9-16**]). Lactate 2.3. Given 4-5 liters IVFs which iimproved his
blood pressure back to his baseline in the 110s. He remained
