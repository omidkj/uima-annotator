History of Present Illness:
84 yr old pleasantly demented female with h/o DM, HTN, ?CHF who
presents to the ED with increased lethargy.  Per the pt's
daughters, pt was noted to be dizzy one week prior to admission.
 A CXR was done which showed a PNA and she was started on
levaquin (day 1 = [**12-9**]).  One day prior to admission, she was
noted to be more lethargic and she was sent to the ER at the
family's urging the next day.  No report of fevers or chills at
NH.  On arrival to the ER, she was 85/40 with a HR of 79.  She
also spiked a temp to 101.  Her abx were broadened to
CTX/azithro and vancomycin.  A gas showed: 7.35/60/100 on 100%
NRB.  Given her lethargy and tenuous resp status, she was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in hemodynamically stable condition,
without chest pain.  She did not ongoing "heaviness" with her
breathing, but was breathing comfortably on 2L NC.
.
.
# fever: etiology of pt's fever was initially felt [**3-4**]
pneumonia, however retrocardiac density on CXR was not very
impressive, particularly given lack of wbc and lack of findings
on CXR.  UA was negative, pt denies diarrhea or abdominal pain.
Pt s/p 5 days of levaquin, febrile on presentation, afebrile
since then.  pt was complaining of sinus congestions, thus
treated for both pneumonia and sinusitis with ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, but d/c'd abx on [**12-15**] after 6d course as feel
pt's symptoms are more likely related to CHF.  Urine legionella,
sputum, blood, and urine cultures were obtained which were
unremarkable.  Pt was also treated with afrin nasal spray x 3d.
.
.
# lethargy:  pt demented at baseline.  her acute increase in
lethargy was felt most likely [**3-4**] infection versus CHF, although
hypercarbia was possible (though beleive pt was not far off of
baseline CO2 which is likely 53-55 based on previous serum HCO3
levels).  Mental status was much improved on presentation to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**], however [**12-14**] AM pt was quite sleepy, arousable to sternal
rub, but only breifly conversive.  [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, she slept very little
overnight, which could be contributing.  An ABG was obtained
which showed pCO2 60s.  Serum B12, folate, TSH were obtained on
admission which were unremarkable.  Pt received treatment for
underlying infection, diuresis for CHF (-2.2L removed [**12-14**]) and
antipsychotic medications were held.
.
A second trial of full face cpap was attempted overnight [**12-14**],
but pt became apneic (presumably because CO2 was removed
reducing her respiratory drive).  Her lethargy subsequently
resolved, and she was occasionally sleepy, but arousable.  Pt
was felt to be having periodic respirations, which could in the
future benefit from increased dead space in the CPAP circuit,
however given that pt is resistant to CPAP and that she is not
currently lethargic, plan was to recommend outpatient sleep
clinic evaluation to opti
