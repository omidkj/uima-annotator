Intracranial Hemorrhage

Endotracheal Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year-old right-handed man with a past
medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
polycystic kidney disease and alcohol abuse who was initially
evaluated at [**Hospital3 **] after he was found unresponsive by his
some at his home on [**6-16**] and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and care when imaging revealed a right
temporal hemorrhage. He was initially intubated for airway
protection and admitted to the Neuro ICU. Head CT on [**2129-6-19**] was
stable. Hospital course was c/b T1 fracture, hepatic mass,
aspiration PNA rx with Vanc/Zosyn and re-intubation due to
hypercapneic respiratory failure. Patient was also treated for
EtOH withdrawal. He was seen by cardiology for + troponins,
tachycardia, and depressed (EF 35%) which were thought to be due
to his time unresponsive, alcohol, and dehydration/infection. He
was not started on anticoagulation given his head bleed. He was
re-extubated on [**2129-6-20**] and called out to the medicine service
the evening of [**2129-6-21**]. CTA on [**2129-6-21**] showed small subsegmental
PEs and GGO c/w multilobar pna and pleural effusions.
.
The evening of [**2129-6-21**] the pateint was noted to be hypoxic to the
80s on room air. He was placed on nasal canula which improved
his sats to the mid 80s and then placed on NRB with imporvement
to the 90s. He appeared comfortable on the nonrebreather and ABG
showed 7.49/37/183/29. He was then placed on shovel mask and
maintained sats in the 90s. However, he was tachypneic to the
30s and noted that he was "tired." MICU was called to evaluate
the pt for possible intubation due to respiratory failure.
.
The patient appeared calm with sats in the high 90s on shovel
mask. However, he was exhibiting paridoxical abdominal breathing
and use of accessory muscles. He was tachycardic to the 150s and
hypertensive to the 150s. Given his known underlying lobar PNA
and PEs he was transferred to the ICU for possible intubation.
.
In the ICU the pt was placed back on non-rebreather and looked
more comfortable. The decision was made to monitor his
respiratory status and hold off on intubation. He was noted to
have a sluggish and dilated right pupil and was sent for STAT
head CT. Otherwise exam was notable for mild scattered wheezes.

[**2129-6-17**] CT Abdomen
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially fatty liver with numerous hypodense hepatic
lesions. Though
some of these may be cysts, others show evidence of delayed
enhancement and overall these lesions are not well
characterized. These findings as well as the dilated biliary
ducts would be best assessed via MR [**First Name (Titles) 10139**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10015**] appropriate.

2. Scattered poorly marginated pulmonary nodular opacities.
While these may represent areas of aspiration or inflammation,
underlying neoplastic
nodularity is not excluded. We would recommend a repeat
dedicated CT of the chest after appropriate treatment and when
[**Last Name (Titles) 10015**] stable in order to document resolution or stability
of these findings.
3. Innumerable bilateral renal cysts, possibly PCKD.
4. Atherosclerotic disease.
5. Sigmoid diverticulosis.
6. Multiple chronic rib fractures.

[**2129-6-17**] CT Head
IMPRESSION:
Intracerebral hematoma in the right temporal and occipital lobes
with
extension into the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle as
seen on the
recent CT head of [**2129-6-16**] 20:57 hours. Bilateral
low-density
extra-axial collections in keeping with CSF hygroma unchanged.
No new
hemorrhage. No evidence of AV malformation on the CTA study.
.
.
[**2129-6-17**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]
IMPRESSION:
Right temporal hematoma with intraventricular extension. There
is suggestion of associated enhancement which may be seen in the
setting of a subacute hematoma or a metastatic lesion. Recommend
followup study after resolution of acute blood products.
Chronic subdural hygromas bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course - patient was admitted after being found down at home
for an unknown period of time. According to his brother he had
recently been in 3 automobile accidents involving head trauma.
His son had been unable to reach him at home for 2 days and when
landlord opened apartment they found him on the ground with a
bookcase collapsed near him, and an empty bottle of Captain
[**Doctor Last Name **]. In the ICU he was noted to have ecchymosis around his
left eye and some dried blood near his nose. While intubated he
was able to follow commands and had intact cranial nerves as
well as sensation in all 4 extremities. CT revealed a large
temporal hemorrhage on the right side. He was extubated and
there were no obvious neurologic deficits on exam. Troponins had
been elevated in-house, and he peaked at 0.42. A TTE was
performed which showed hypokineses. He started to withdraw from
EtOH and was having elevated systolics in the 160s, agitation
and delerium. He required large IV doses of Ativan and was then
reintubated for concern of airway protection. The patient was
then re-extubated without issues and started on antibiotics for
concern of pneumonia. He was sent to the stroke team for
continued care.

MICU [**Location (un) **] Course:  The patient presented to MICU after
respiratory distress/increasing O2 requirement and possible
impending respiratory failure.  He was placed on non-rebreather
mask and stabilized.  He was on Zosyn and vancomycin was dc'd
based on speciation of moraxella from sputum.  He was gently
