Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 598**]
Chief Complaint:
PE, head bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2174-2-20**]
IVC filter placement
[**2174-2-21**]
Catheter directed embolectomy of right and left pulmonary
arteries


History of Present Illness:
This is a 45yo male admitted to the trauma service after falling
down 10 stairs and fracturing his neck, in the setting of heavy
alcohol consumption.

He was initially taken to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital and was found to have
a SAH and type 3 dens fracture on CT. He was transported to
[**Hospital1 18**] via helicopter for  eurosurgical evaluation.  Upon arrival
in the ER at [**Hospital1 18**] he was awake and alert x 3, with a GCS of 15
per the ER staff.  CT of the body was obtained which revealed a
saddle embolus of unkown chronicity. He complained of headache
and left ear pain as well as neck pain.  He denied nausea,
vomiting, blurry or double vision.

He was initially placed on a heparin gtt but this was stopped
when his 2nd head CT showed progression of the SAH and also
intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the left cerebellar hemisphere.
An IVC filter was placed due to the finding of fresh left
popliteal thrombus.  Thrombectomy of the saddle embolus was
attempted today via IR and was partially successful.  He was
intubated for airway protection.

[**2174-3-1**] CT head: stable.
[**2174-2-27**] CT head:  Expected interval evolution of
intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and intraventricular hemorrhage.
No significant change in lateral and third ventricles compared
to [**2174-2-24**].
[**2174-2-24**] CT head: Minimally increased size of lateral ventricles
and third ventricle, most compatible with mild degree of
hydrocephalus, slightly increased since prior exam. Grossly
stable subdural, subarachnoid, intraparenchymal and
intraventricular
hemorrhage as described above. Grossly stable appearance of the
partially imaged paranasal sinuses. Stable appearance of the
left frontal extra-axial space, which is slightly prominent, may
represent an early subdural hygroma or otherwise may be due to
positioning. Attention on followup imaging is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 45 year old male s/p [**2174**]0 stairs in the setting of
significant EtOH intake, transfered from OSH where imaging
showed SAH & IVH; found to have massive saddle PE & L popliteal
DVT. Although initially started on heparin GTT for PE, this was
stopped in the setting of worsening head bleed. He underwent IVC
filter on [**2-21**] and catheter PE thrombectomy [**2-21**]. He was
initially intubated due to concern for loss of airway protection
[**2-8**] head bleed and hypoxia [**2-8**] PE, but was successfully
extubated on [**2174-2-23**].
.
EVENTS:
[**2-21**] on heparin for saddle PE
[**2-21**]: IVF Filter placed
[**2-21**]: Repeat HD CT: worsening bleed, heparin stopped
[**2-21**]: IR for embolectomy, ? chronic PE, could not be removed
[**2-21**]: Spine recs: hard collar x 8 weeks. Neurosurgery recs: no
anticoagulation, repeat HD CT in am of [**2-22**].
[**2-22**]: Repeat CT head slightly worse, NS aware. Loaded with
dilantin. Unable to extubate given problems with secretions and
low [**Name (NI) 85993**] on minimal settings.
[**2-23**]: extubated successfully.
.
Neuro: After intial worsening of ICH, it was seen to be stable
on subsequent CT scans, albeit with mild hydrocepholas. The
patient received 7 days of dilantin as seizure prophylaxis. In
regards to his Dens fracture, ortho spine recommended MiamiJ
collar x8wks as well as follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks w/
repeat head CT. Although initially on IV pain medications, he
was transitioned to PO percocet with good effect.
.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. His echo showed normal LV
function, severe RV dilation w/ mild global free wall
hypokinesis in the setting of the saddle PE.
.
Pulm: The patient was initiated on Coumadin prior to discharge
as treatment for his PE and DVT. Head CT was stable at that
time.  He was on room air without hypoxia at discharge.
.
GI: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. The patient's diet was advanced to
regular, which he tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel
regimen to encourage bowel movement.
.
Renal: The patient's urine output was adequate with stable renal
function during this hospitalization.
.
Heme: As noted above, the patient was started on Coumadin as
treatment of his PE and L popliteal DVT. Hematology was
consulted and said that no hypercoaguable work-up was indicated
during this hospitalization as it would not alter management.
The patient will need to be anti-coagulated for life, given the
recurrence of DVT/PE as well as the severity of his PE. He will
need to follow up with a hematologist as an out-patient for
additional evaluation.
.
ID: For his left ear laceration, the patient was treated
prophylactically with levofloxacin. He also had sulfamylon +
xeroform dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] per plastics. He will follow-up in
plastics clinic after discharge.
