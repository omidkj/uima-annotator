52 yo male with h/o poorly controlled hypertension and tobacco
abuse presented to his PCP's office today with chest pain, seen
in [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for STEMI.

Patient reports he felt like he had an "attack" on Sunday (5
days PTA) while taking a shower, felt like his "whole lungs"
hurt. Also had diaphoresis and dizziness at the time. Since then
had been feeling short of breath and having chest pain.  Finally
presented to his PCP's office today for a medication refill and
mentioned his pain. Pain at that time [**1-29**], ECG reportedly
concerning for MI.  He presented by car then to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
(refused ambulance), where troponin I was 5.72  and EKG showed
1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in inferior limb leads with reciprocal
changes in lateral chest leads.  Started on heparin gtt, loaded
with 600mg [**Street Address(2) 4532**], given metoprolol and aspirin 325mg and
transferred urgently to the cath.

In the cath lab, he was found to have subtotal occlusion of RCA,
50-60% lesion in mid/prox LAD and 40-50% in LCx.  RCA was a
small [**Last Name (LF) 12425**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] lesion was POBA'd with good flow. He was
started on integrillin with plan to continue this for 18 hours
in the CCU.

On arrival to the CCU, patient is chest pain free and
comfortable.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo M with history of poorly controlled hypertension and
tobacco abuse who presented with chest pain, found to have
STEMI, now s/p POBA of RCA.

ACUTE ISSUES:

# STEMI: s/p balloon angioplasty to the RCA.  Troponin I 5.72 at
OSH, however MB here is 5 (no MB at OSH).  Event likely occurred
5 days prior to admission when he had severe pain, and he
arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] chest pain free. Echo showed likely
preserved EF at >50% with no obvious wall motion abnormalities
(however poor windows).  He was started on [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **],
atorvastatin, ACE-i. Beta blocker was also started at lower dose
due to episodes of bradycardia (see below). We also encouraged
smoking cessation and dietary changes

# Bradycardia: Patient had several episodes of bradycardia with
pauses lasting at longest 6.5 seconds. This was mainly at night
and was asymptomatic.  Episodes possibly a complication of his
inferior MI with resultant ischemia to conduction system,
however more likely they are vagal in nature.  Beta blocker dose
was decreased and he had no further episodes on telemetry.

# Acute diastolic congestive heart failure: LVEDP elevated at 26
in the cath lab, volume overloaded on exam. EF found to be
preserved at >50%, likely had diastolic dysfunction in setting
of acute MI.  Volume status mproved with IV lasix diuresis.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#  COPD: albuterol PRN

#  Tobacco abuse:  He was given nicotine 21mcg patch We
encouraged smoking cessation

# Possible hemochromatosis: report h/o therapeutic phlebotomy.
Hct and ferritin elevated, however no sign of cardiac
involvement.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Bradycardia: will follow up with cardiologist, will continue
low dose metoprolol

#STEMI: Will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2118-7-21**].
Discharged on metoprolol, lisinopril, aspirin, [**Date Range 4532**], and
atorvastatin.

#Hemochromatosis: follow up with heme/onc
