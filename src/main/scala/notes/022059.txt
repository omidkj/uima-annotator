IMAGING:
-[**2136-7-1**] CXR:
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**2136-6-30**].
There is unchanged cardiomegaly.  There is improvement of the
airspace
opacities in the right perihilar region and the left
retrocardiac area.  There is persistent prominence of pulmonary
interstitial markings consistent with pulmonary edema.  This is
slightly improved.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room for scheduled right
hemicolectomy for colon mass. She tolerated this procedure well
and was taken to the PACU initially in good condition; for full
details please see the dictated operative note.

On POD#1 she became hypoxic to the 70's on room air, and was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring of her respiratory
status. O2 sats improved with NRB and hypoxia was thought likely
[**3-8**] atelectasis, fluid overload, and possibility of brewing
infection. Pt was given IV lasix, encouraged to use the
incentive spirometer, and was maintained on aggressive pain
control to prevent splinting. She was started on
vancomycin/cefepime to treat for HCAP given low grade temp to
100.2 upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], increasing leukocytosis, as well
as retrocardiac opacity seen on CXR. Additionally, she was given
2 units of pRBC for HCT 22 on [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] day 2 along with another dose
of lasix. Her oxygen saturations improved with deep breathing
and adequate pain control was helping with this. She was stable
and transferred to the surgical floor on 5/28am.

Her floor course was very straight forward and she improved
daily. She was stable on 3L NC by the time she was transferred
out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]; over the next day this was weaned off to room
air. She ambulated with assistance from nursing and physical
therapy and increased her activity level daily. Once she had
flatus she was advanced to a regular diet, which she tolerated
with no difficulties. She had multiple BM's prior to discharge.
She was continued on vanc/cefepime for HCAP throughout her stay,
and will go to rehab on an additional 5 days of PO levaquin.
This has been addressed with her PCP as well who has approved of
the antibiotic plan.

At time of discharge she is improving steadily. She is
ambulating with some assistance, tolerating a regular diet, and
pain is well controlled on oral medications. She is discharged
to rehab on POD 5 and will follow up in clinic in [**2-6**] weeks.
