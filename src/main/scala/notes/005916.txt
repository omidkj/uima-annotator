History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94057**] is a 78 year old woman with history of diabetes,
diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation s/p PPM placement, and
hypertension who presents to the ED today for altered mental
status. She was noted by her caregiver to be increasingly
lethargic over the last day (not seen over the weekend). She
reports feeling tired and weak. Per her caregiver, she has had
waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental alertness, mumbling, confusion, weakness,
and difficulty walking. She denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, cough, dyspnea, shortness of breath, chest pain,
urinary symptoms, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. She has noted
that her blood sugars have been more difficult to control
recently, with sugars in the 400's. She reports normal PO intake
and normal urine output.
.
She presented to clinic with FS 310, afebrile, with pulse 70.
She was sent to the ED for further workup. In the ED, her vital
signs were 97.7F, HR 73, BP 138/73, 92%RA which improved to 97%
on 2L. 2 peripheral IV's were placed. Blood cultures were drawn,
CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process, and she was given 1
liter of normal saline with 40mEq of KCl. She was found to have
a finger stick of 449 with anion gap of 16. She was admitted to
the MICU for DKA and altered mental status.
.
On arrival to the floor, stat blood gas demonstrated:
7.51/49/84/40. Her anion gap on repeat labs was 10. She was
restarted on her home insulin doses, given one liter of IVF over
several hours, and monitored. Diuretics were held.

SHOULDER [**12-23**] VIEWS NON TRAUMA
.
Reason: Please evaluate r-shoulder for pathology, interval
change.
.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with diastolic HF, DM, HTN, c/o shoulder pain
with abduction. History of shoulder mass on [**2128**] imaging.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate r-shoulder for pathology, interval change.
RIGHT SHOULDER, THREE VIEWS, [**2131-11-6**]
.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Shoulder pain with abduction, history of
shoulder mass in [**2128**].
COMPARISON STUDY: [**2129-5-20**].
FINDINGS:
Since the prior study, there is marked interval narrowing of the
acromiohumeral distance and the humerus is high riding and now
articulates with the acromion, consistent with chronic rotator
cuff tear. There are marked degenerative changes at the
glenohumeral joint and the acromioclavicular joint. There are
large osteophytes arising from the femoral head. There are also
marked degenerative changes at the acromioclavicular joint.
IMPRESSION:
1. Chronic rotator cuff tear.
2. Degenerative changes at the acromioclavicular joint and
glenohumeral joint.

Reason: assess for interval change or development of new infarct

.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with dCHF, PAF, DM, p/w DKA and now with
persistant AMS and leukocytosis despite negative w/u thus far
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for interval change or development of new infarct
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
.
INDICATION: CHF, PAF, DM, presenting with DKA and now with
persistent altered mental status and leukocytosis, despite
negative workup. Query interval change or development of new
infarct.
.
COMPARISON: [**2131-11-1**].
.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain. No contrast was administered.
.
FINDINGS: The study is degraded by motion. No evidence of
hemorrhage or infarction. Ventricles are stable in size and
configuration. There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Again seen is left scleral band. The left lens has been
surgically removed. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
appear clear.
.
IMPRESSION: No impression of infarction, hemorrhage, mass
effect, or infection.
