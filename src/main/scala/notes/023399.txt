History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19075**] is a 67-year-old gravida 0 woman with a past medical
history significant for diabetes, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and morbid obesity, who noted
postmenopausal bleeding.  An ultrasound was performed on the
[**2179-7-6**], and this revealed, in a fairly limited study, a
large complex right adnexal cystic mass, ovarian in origin.  The
endometrium was not clearly visualized; however, the uterus
measured 12.3 x 10.6 x 8.3 cm and multiple fibroids were noted.
The kidneys were unremarkable and there was a small amount of
free fluid noted within the posterior cul-de-sac.  A followup CT
scan of the abdomen and pelvis was then performed on [**2179-7-8**],
and this revealed once again the solid cystic and right adnexal
mass measuring 15 x 12 x 8 cm.  There was no significant free
fluid or irregularities suggestive of ascites.  The CA-125 level
was elevated at 395 and a CEA level of 44.3 was noted.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 19075**] in the past week has been hospitalized for pulmonary
embolism.  She developed a blood clot in her leg and was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation.  A CTA of the chest
revealed ascites with bilateral pulmonary emboli.  A IVC filter
was placed.  She has been started on low-molecular-weight
heparin.

Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As mentioned, the patient suffers from
diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and recently was
diagnosed with a DVT and pulmonary embolism.
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had her left ovary removed through a
vertical midline incision in [**2160**].  She believes it was for
benign disease.
.
OB/GYN HISTORY:  Her last menstrual cycle "years and years ago."

She denies any history of pelvic infections or abnormal Pap
smears.  Her last Pap smear was obtained in 10/[**2177**].


Social History:
She denies tobacco, drug, or alcohol use.  She is retired.  She
worked for an astronomy magazine called [**Hospital Ward Name **] & Telescope, and she
worked there for years and years.


Family History:
She reports her father had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer at the age of 59.


Physical Exam:
GENERAL:  She appears her stated age, in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oral mucosa without evidence
of thrush or mucositis.  Eyes, sclerae are anicteric.
NECK:  Supple, no masses, no thyromegaly identified.
LYMPHATICS:  Lymph node survey, negative cervical,
supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy.
CHEST:  Lungs clear bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  I appreciate no murmurs.
BACK:  No spinal or CVA tenderness.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, obese, nontender, nondistended.  A large
vertical midline incision is noted.  I am unable to palpate any
mass or irregularity.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
PELVIC:  Normal external genitalia.  The inner labia minora is
normal.  Urethral meatus is normal.  There is no bleeding
identified on speculum exam, the cervix is normal in appearance.
 Bimanual exam is dominated by a pelvic mass that extends over
to the right side.  It is nonmobile.
RECTAL:  Reveals good sphincter tone without mass or lesion.
