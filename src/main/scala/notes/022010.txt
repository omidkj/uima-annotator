[**2150-12-3**] Chest CTA scan: No pulmonary embolus. Bilateral patchy
areas of ground-glass opacity throughout both lungs with a
smooth intralobular septal thickening and small bilateral

failure. More dense appearing areas of consolidation are present
in both lower lobes.

abnormality. No cholelithiasis. Small bilateral effusions. Heavy

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiology service. Shortly
after admission, she was started on intravenous Nitro and
Integrilin for recurrent angina. She also required a fair amount
of anxiolytics. The following day, she underwent cardiac
catheterization. Left ventriculography was not performed.
Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system. The left
anterior descending was totally occluded after the first
diagonal, the first diagonal had a 90% ostial stenosis, the
circumflex had a proximal 50% lesion, OM2 had a 90% stenosis,
and the RCA had a 60% lesion. Based on the above results,
cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation was
performed. Given her thrombocytosis on admission, the hematology
service was consulted. Her thrombocytosis was most likely a
reactive thrombocytosis from recent infection, which did not
place her at an elevated risk or developing thrombosis or
bleeding. Essential thrombocytosis was less likely. She was also
noted to have a mildly macrocytic anemia. There was no
contraindication to proceed with surgery. She was also noted to
have elevated prothrombin time and alk phos. Vitamin K was given
and abdominal ultrasound was obtained which showed no liver mass
or biliary abnormalities, or cholelithiasis. Cardiac
echocardiogram revealed no aortic regurgitation and only mild
mitral regurgitation. There was severe regional LV systolic
dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease/myocardial
infarction. Her LVEF was estimated at 25-30%. She otherwise
remained pain free on intravenous therapy and was eventually
cleared for surgery. By that time her platelet count improved
from 988K to 811K.

On [**12-8**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed redo sternotomy, and four
vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. Please see operative
note for surgical details. Following the operation, she was
brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours,
she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. She gradually weaned from pressor support and was
intermittently transfused with PRBC and intravenous fluids to
maintain adequate hemodynamics. Amiodarone was initiated for
episodes of atrial fibrillation. She remained mostly in a normal
sinus rhythm. Last episode of atrial fibrillation was on
postoperative day postoperative day three. She was pan cultured
for a leukocytosis, white count peaking just above 30K. All
cultures remained negative and white count slowly improved
through out the remainder of her hospital stay. After several
days of diuresis along with titrating medical therapy, she
gradually started to show clinical improvements. On
postoperative day seven, she transferred to the step-down floor
for further care and recovery. Given history of
anxiety/depression and continued requirement for anxiolytics,
the psychiatry service was consulted adn recommended
continuation of her current regimen. By post-operative day nine,
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was ready for discharge in stable condition to home.
