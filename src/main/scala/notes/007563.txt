History of Present Illness:
80 year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 3
cycles of R-CHOP presented to the ED with fever. She was
recently admitted on [**11-4**] with dehydration and diarrhea. She
was noted to have febrile neutropenia and was treated with abx
as well as GCSF. She was discharged home with levaquin and
completed this on [**11-12**]. On [**11-18**] pt received cycle 3 of R-CHOP
and GCSF. She now returns with fever at home to 101.6. Denies
any neck stiffness, headache, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea or dysuria. She does have a cough with some clear
sputum, but no worse than usual. No rash was noted by her. In [**Name (NI) **]
pt's temp was 100.1, bp stable. Physical exam revealed no clear
source of infection or bleeding source. Labs revealed nl chem7,
nl wcc, low hct of 20. Ua was negative. CXR was negative for
acute pathology and prior diagnosed lingular pneumonia has now
resolved. She was cultured and given a dose of Cefepime and
Vancomycin. She's admitted for transfusion and further
observation for possible infection. On arrival to the floor pt
complains of some shortness of breath and wheeze which resolved
with a nebulizer.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2101-11-30**]
1. Moderate-to-severe emphysema, with superimposed smooth septal
thickening and vague ground- glass opacities particularly in the
upper lobes. This is most consistent with hydrostatic edema, but
could also be seen in entities such as infection (viral, PCP),
hemorrhage, or hypersensitivity reaction. 2. Partially
obstructing lesion in the left lower lobe bronchus is concerning
for neoplasm, either endobronchial lymphoma or another neoplasm
such as carcinoid. Bronchoscopy is recommended. 3. Extensive
secretions noted within the trachea and right main bronchus. 4.
Stable to slightly decreased multiple bilateral pulmonary
nodules. 5. Nonaggressive chondroid appearing lesion in the
right proximal humerus. 6. Incompletely evaluated soft tissue
mass in the upper abdomen, similar in appearance to the recent
PET/CT study.
.
ECHO [**2101-12-1**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
CTA [**2101-12-8**]: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Stable
interstitial abnormality superimposed on centrilobular
emphysema. 3. Stable multiple pulmonary nodules. 4. Multifocal
air trapping.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo female with high grade lymphoma s/p day 11 after R-CHOP
cycle 3 with fever at home as well as anemia noted on lab
results.
.
#. Respiratory Distress: Patient was treated for COPD
exacerbation on IV steroids and NEBS. Completed course of
Levofloxacin for possible CAP. CT scan demonstrated ground glass
opacities and LLL nodule. Underwent bronchscopy [**12-2**], showing
highly vascular LLL endobronchial lesion and thick secretions.
BAL negative for pcp. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] [**12-6**]
for rigid bronch by IP to investigate the LLL lesion (concern
was primary lung cancer vs. lymphoma). Endobronchial lesion was
resected with cauterization, but not completely removed. Pt
sustained R-pneumothorax from barotrauma, prompting R-pigtail
catheter and increased O2 requirement to [**Month/Year (2) 597**] in PACU. She was
consequently transferred to MICU for monitoring. On later review
by radiology, it didn't look like she had a pneumothorax. On
[**12-8**], she again required [**Name (NI) 597**] - unclear cause (?mucus plugging);
chest CT was negative for PE but demonstrated worsening ground
glass. Patient underwent repeat bronchoscopy for PCP (negative).
LLL lesion biopsy was confirmed as a carcinoid tumour by
pathology. Thoracic surgery evaluated her and felt she is not a
candidate for surgery.
.
#. Fever: Patient with documented fever in ER. Patient was
afebrile throughout course of admission. Was treated with
Levofloxacin course for possible CAP. Otherwise no known source
of infection. PCP was ruled out with BAL X 2. Patient discharged
on Bactrim for pcp [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
#. Anemia: Resolved with transfusions in the ER. Likely [**2-26**]
chemotherapy.
.
#. Lymphoma: s/p r-chop cycle 3. Patient to follow up with
primary oncologist regarding treatment.
.
# COPD: Patient was treated for COPD exacerbation on IV steroids
and NEBS. Patient discharged on prednisone taper. By discharge
patient was stable on home O2 requirement of 2 liters oxygen.
