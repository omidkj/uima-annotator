Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Slumping over and aphasia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is a 75 year-old right-handed with a PMH of HTN and
asthma who was transferred from [**Hospital 1121**] hospital after being
treated with tPA for a possible stroke. This history is compiled
from his wife as well as transfer records.

Mr. [**Known lastname 69906**] was in his USOH today when at 1pm he abruptly
stopped talking and then slumped over in his chair. His wife was
initially concerned that he might be choking and therefore tried
the Heimlich maneuver on without success. She then called EMS.
Per report, he was found to be globally aphasic and with a R
sided facial droop and weakness.

He was taken to [**Hospital 1121**] hospital and a code stroke was
called. He was evaluated around 2pm his vitals per the flow
sheet
showed BP ranging from 130-170's. A CT and CTA were done but no
report is available, however it appears that there is an
occlusion of the L ICA and MCA per my read of the disc.
Screening
labs showed Glucose 116, INR 1.1, Plt 151, and a Cr 1.4.

Given his persistent aphasia and R sided weakness of both arm
and
leg, he was treated with tPA. The initial infusion was started
at
1518 and the bolus dose was reported to be 8.4mg, after which he
was given a total of 75.3mg infused over an hour. The infusion
was completed at 16:18. In the records there is a flow sheet
which described him as having some verbal output although
details
are not provided. Shortly thereafter he was noted to have
shaking
of the R arm and leg without LOC which spread to shaking of arms
and legs. There was no LOC, incontinence or tongue biting. He
was
given 1gm of keppra and the shaking had stopped prior to this
infusion. He was then med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

EKG - Sinus tachycardia with PVCs with borderline 1st degree A-V
block
Nonspecific inferolateral T wave flattening

Head CT and Head CTA results - NONCONTRAST: No hemorrhage, shift
or hydrocephalus. The grey white matter differentiation remains
intact. Note is made of unusal hyppattenuation of the right
pons, which is of uncertain etiology.
CTA: Extensive atherosclertotic plaque in the left bulb and near
occlusion of the proximal left ICA. The left mid ICA is narrowed
but remains patent until the petrous segment at which there is
occlusion proximally and minimal contrast opacification distally
through the remainder of the petrous/cavernous carotid and into
the M1 segment, where it recanulizes after the trifurcation.
The right MCA, bilateral ACA, bilateral vetebral arteries,
basilar and
bilateral PCA are patent. Incidental note is made of multiple
enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 12 mm in the
right paratracheal station, which may be reative.
CTP images show decreased blood flow, increased mean transit
time, and
relatively [**Name2 (NI) 69907**] blood volume in the left MCA territory
suggesting that the area of concern is ischemic/at risk.

CXR - NEG

ECHO - WNL
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

MRA HEAD - Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
Acute, scattered infarcts involving portions of the left middle
cerebral
artery distribution. Nonvisualized left petrous, cavernous and
supraclinoid
carotid, which are better visualized on CTA from [**2122-7-14**].

Head CTA - No acute hemorrhage. Left MCA infarction, better
evaluated on MRI of [**2122-7-15**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for language arrest and left hemiparesis. Pt
obtained HCT, MRI/A Head and Neck and Echo. MRI brain showed
multiple infarcts in the L MCA territory. MRA brain showed
extensive clot which causes near occlusion of the distal left
ICA and which extends into the M1 portion of the left MCA. The
most likely etiology of his strokes was embolism from the left
ICA or M1. Heparin was started. He was then transitioned to
coumadin and bridged with Lovenox. Lovenox teaching completed
for wife and sons. Spoke with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 131**] regarding hospital
course and updates. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 131**] will follow INR to ensure a
therapeutic coumadin level. Pt instructed to complete a CTA Head
and Neck in 3months. Outpatient appointment made and
prescription written for pt. PT/OT/ST rendered while in the
hospital. Outpatient Speech Therapy arranged and Speech Therapy
prescription written to allow for outpatient speech therapy if
there is a delay in the prearranged speech therapy.
