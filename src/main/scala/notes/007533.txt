Brief Hospital Course:
[**2164-7-2**] Underwent Re-do superficial femoral artery to anterior
tibial artery bypass graft with nonreversed right basilic vein
for right bypass graft thrombosis resulting in ischemia and rest
pain. No complications. Extubated and transfered to PACU then
[**Wardname **]. VSS. Pulses intact. On Hepain gtt. During OR procedure-
discovered a large amount of thrombus within the superficial
femoral artery intraoperatively. Decided to return to the endo
[****] for diagnostic angiogram.
[**2164-7-3**] Overnight, no events. Underwent AngioJet thrombectomy of
the right superficial femoral artery with embolic protection.
Stenting of the right superficial femoral artery. Perclose
closure of left common femoral arteriotomy. Procedure without
complication and he was transfered to the floor in stable
condition. However, almost immediately upon arrival to floor-the
patient abruptly became agitated at 1pm, trying to remove his
foley, his A-line, and his central line.  He refused to lie flat
and sat up in his bed, threatening to leave AMA.  Due
to a concern for his graft and groin, a number of nurses and
physicians were called to the patient's room to restrain him. He
received 2mg of ativan but became even more agitated, and a code
purple was called.  He was then put in 4 point leather
restraints due to a concern for harm to himself.  He was
ultimately given
3mg of ativan and 7.5mg of haldol with good effect.  At that
time, the restraints were switched to soft cuffs.  The patient's
vital signs remained stable over this time with the exception of
some tachycardia.  The graft and his DP pulse remained palpable,
though the calf became edematous.  His foot
was warm.  There was no groin hematoma.  His arm dressing showed
some strike-though, but the wound was intact when the dressing
was taken down.  His foley had been mildly bloody prior to this
episode, and he continued to have hematura.  The foley was kept
in place. Post operative Assessment:  47M POD0 s/p proximal
right SFA angioplasty and stent with acute agitation, likely the
result of EtOH withdrawal,
otherwise stable. CIWA scale was substantially increased to
cover withdrawal symptoms per psych nurses. Transfered to CVICU
for monitoring.
[**2164-7-4**]. Remained in CVICU overnight under heavy sedation for
DT/ETOH withdrawl. Hematoma larger, underwent Evacuation of
right lower extremity hematoma, Right upper extremity cephalic
vein harvest, Exploration of right lower extremity vein graft
with vein patch angioplasty. Remained intubated/sedated for ETOH
withdrawl. Transfused. SBP maintained 100-140.
[**2164-7-5**] Overnight, in CVICU. Intubated. Clonidine patch, Valium
started. Febrile to 102.6- pan cultured, Vanco and Cefepime
started.
[**Date range (1) 50819**] Extubated. Continue withdrawl/CIWA and dilaudid for
pain. Remained to CVICU for close montioring, withdrawl. Pulses
stable.
[**Date range (1) 50820**] VSS. No events. Transfered to VICU/[**Wardname **] for continued
care. Working with PT. Psychiatry consulted, following. On
Heparing gtt.  Coumadin restarted. Sputum + for MSSA, HFlu.
STarted Nafacillin.
[**7-11**]-VSS. No events. PT cleared pt for home with home PT and
rolling walker. Will discharge on Dicloxacillin, Lovenox and
Coumadin. Lovenox teaching performed, pt able to administer.
Resume anticoagulation management by PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] up office visit
