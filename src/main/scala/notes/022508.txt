Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**]
Chief Complaint:
Called out from MICU after normal workup for pseudoseizure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization, no intervention required.


History of Present Illness:
   48 y/o m with h/o chronic CP with multiple prior cardiac
caths (last [**1-22**] here showing just 50% RCA) and thrombolysis for
ST elev in V1 V2 (thought to be Brugada pattern EKG) was ruled
out for MI at OSH, has been having CP for 5 days without any
bump in CE, was transferred here for cath for persistent CP. CP
usually not responsive to SLNTG, only morphine. Some concern for
drug seeking/malingering behavior per psych consult from OSH.
Also c/o L sided weakness for 2 days. MRI/A neg at OSH, neuro
consulted, psych consulted and concern fdor malingering. Also
has episode of unresponsiveness while in MRI scanner at OSH. Has
had prior negative EEGs, neuro concerned for pseudoseizures. On
arrival here CP was felt to be unlikely cardiac as negative
enzymes and no new EKG changes. Plan for MIBI on Monday.

CXR: Compared with a portable AP chest of two days ago, as well
as portable chest from [**2135-7-19**], no consolidating pulmonary
infiltrates or definite acute process seen.

EKG: Sinus rhythm, rate 85. Poor R wave progression. ST segment
elevation in leads VI-V3 with associated T wave inversion.
Consider anteroseptal injury current. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2139-12-23**] ST segments are less elevated in lead V2 and
are newly elevated in lead V3. T waves are inverted in leads VI
and V3. This may represent lead placement but is also consistent
with evolution of an anteroseptal injury process

Cardiac cath:
 COMMENTS:
 1.  Hemodynamic evaluation revealed a normal central aortic
pressure of
118/69 mmHg and a normal LVEDP of 12 mmHg.  There was no
gradient across
the aortic valve on pullback of the angled pigtail cathter from
the left
ventricle to the ascending aorta.
 2.  Left ventriculography revealed a borderline normal ejection
fraction
of 51%.  There were no wall motion abnormalities.  There was no
mitral
regurgitation.
 3.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant
system
revealed no significant disease.  The LMCA, LAD, and LCX as well
as
their branches were free of flow-limiting stenoses.  The RCA had
a mid
30% stenosis.
 4.  Successful angioseal of the right femoral arteriotomy site.


 FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
 1. Coronary arteries without significant disease.
 2. Borderline ventricular function.
 3. Successful angioseal.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Chest pain:

48yo man with history of chronic chest pain and Brugada type [**Hospital **]
transferred from outside hospital with chest pain.  He ruled out

for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.  He underwent a
p-MIBI
stress test, which was significant for a moderate reversible
perfusion
defect in the inferior wall with no wall motion abnormalities.
He subsequently
underwent cardiac catheterization, which was only significant
for a 30% RCA lesion.
This was without complication.  He was maintained on his ASA and
amlodipine,
and the amlodipine was changed to low dose atenolol before
discharge.
He was given NTG prn for pain.  Otherwise, his lipids were
significant for
LDL at 76.  His triglycerides were elevated at 251; this will
need to
addressed as an outpatient.

2.  Pseudoseizures:

Has history of pseudoseizures with previous negative EEG
studies.  He was evaluated by Neurology, who felt that this was
pseudoseizure. Psychiatry concurred with this diagnosis.
Additionally, he had a 24hour EEG, which captured only a
pseudoseizure and no evidence of epileptiform activity.

3. Fever:

Hospital course significant for intermittent fevers with no
localizing
source, and no abnormalities on UA or chest xray.  He was
systemically well
and afebrile upon discharge.

4.  HTN:

This was well controlled on amlodipine during his hospital
course; it
was changed to low dose atenolol before discharge.  He will f/u
with
Cardiology for further management.

5.  L sided weakness: poor effort on exam but intact strength
bilat, concern for malingering, MRI/A negative at OSH, psych
consulted for malingering.

6. stuttering/slurred speech: not c/w any neuro lesion as
alternates stuttering and slurred speech with intermittent
resolution of both, no defect of word finding or repitition or
comprehension, pt R handed

7.  Dispo:

Patient will be discharged to home, no services required.
He was to be seen by PT for gait/steadiness, as he had
complained
of some lightheadedness with ambulating.  He was observed by his
nurse
[**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 17981**] before discharge, and he had no symptoms of
lightheadedness
or gait instability.

He will f/u with his PCP as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology
for further care.
