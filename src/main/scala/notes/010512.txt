Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2142-4-5**] where
she underwent revascularization(LIMA-LAD, AVG-RCA, SBG-Ramus,
SVG-Om2).  She weaned from bypass on Vasopressin,
NeoSynephrine,Propofol and Insulin infusions. Please see
operative note for further details. Post-op TEE revealed
improved EF of 50% from 40% and she was noted to have
bradycardia with a HR in the 40's (JR v's CHB). She was seen by
EP and started on dopamine (preoperative rhythm Wenchebach 2:1
50's). Her heart rate improved and she returned to her pre-op
rhythm.

 She was extubted on POD#1 and weaned successfully from pressors
and inotropes. She was initially confused and narcotics were
minimized. She tranferred to the floor on POD #3. Beta blockers
were held due to rhythm concerns and diuretic therapy was
started. By the time of discharge she was below her preoperative
weight. She had a slight bump in her creatinine but this was
trending back to baseline.

Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility and it was
decided that because of her continued needs she would need rehab
services.

The patient is a known diabetic and her blood sugars were
elevated in the post-operative period. Her Lantus and Novolog
sliding scales were increased and she was well controlled. Her
blood sugars will need to be monitored while at rehab with goal
blood sugars of <150.

 She did received blood post-operatively, her hematocrit remains
low but stable at 25. On POD # 5 she was deemed safe to be
discharged to [**Location (un) 25112**] at [**Doctor Last Name **] Ponds in [**Location (un) 5087**].
The patient refused to go and stayed one more night. On POD #6
she was agreeable to go to rehab and discharged in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
