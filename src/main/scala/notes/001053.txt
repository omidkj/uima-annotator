Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute type A dissection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2118-5-16**]- sternal debridement,
[**2118-5-2**] - Flexible bronchoscopy with aspiration, open
tracheostomy tube with 8-0 Portex tracheostomy and 20-French PEG
tube placement.
[**2118-4-25**] - Repair of acute type A aortic dissection with 30mm
Dacron interposition tube graft from the sinotubular junction to
the hemiarch using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with
aortic valve resuspension.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1391**] is a 60 year old man who was admitted on [**2118-4-25**]
with a Type A aortic dissection. He had been at work earlier in
the day, and reportedly acutely complained of chest pain and
clutched his chest ~ 12:30 pm while
doing physical labor. He was brought to an outside hospital
where he was initially conversant, but then became less
responsive and unstable. A CT scan revealed a dissection from
the aortic root to the bifurcation, and occlusion of the R
carotid artery. His intubation was reportedly traumatic, with a
fair amount of bleeding. Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] he was sedated
and had an unclear
neurological status. Neuro consult was obtained and he was taken
emergently to the operating room for repair.

Past Medical History:
None known.


Social History:
Works on a farm in Msssachusetts doing manual labor. Smokes
1/2-1 ppd of tobacco. Drinks alcohol- up to 4 drinks per day.


Family History:
Grandchild and daughter in law with pneumonia a few weeks ago


Physical Exam:
[**2118-4-25**] -
Gen- critically ill, intubated and recently sedated.

MS- no response to noxious stimuli
CN- pupils 4mm and unreactive to light, absent oculocephalic
response, absent corneal reflex, face appears symmetric.

Motor- no movement, no withdrawal to noxious
Reflexes- trace 1+ reflexes on the left [**Hospital1 **], brachiorad, patella.
I am unable to elicite reflexes on the right side.
Toes are mute bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
[**2118-4-26**] Carotid Ultrasound
1. 80-99% stenosis in the right internal carotid artery.
2. 60-69% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery.

[**2118-4-28**] Brain MRI
IMPRESSION:
Multiple foci of acute ischemia, as detailed above.

Cortical signal abnormality in the occipital lobe/right frontal
lobe may be related to hypoxia.

Moderate right and mild left carotid narrowing in the neck. This
appears to be discordant with the ultrasound report. Recommend
correlation with a CTA for further evaluation.

Right A1 stenosis, otherwise unremarkable MRA of the brain.

[**2118-4-25**] ECHO
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The ascending aorta is markedly dilated A mobile density is seen
in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. The dissection is seen as far down as the probe
passes in the descending aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen, owing to the dissection flap prolapsing
through the aortic valve. The aortic root is dilated, but not
completely effaced. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass: The aortic valve has be resuspended and has mild
aortic insufficiency. There is a tube graft in the ascending
aorta with laminar flow. Biventricular fuction is preserved.
Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.

[**2118-5-2**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

OBJECT: S/P AORTIC DISSECTION NOW UNRESPONSIVE, EVALUATE FOR
SEIZURE.


REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]


FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: The background rhythm was slow a poorly
modulated
reaching a 6 Hz maximum in the most awake state.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as the patient was
unresponsive and could not cooperate.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: No normal waking morphologies were seen. The patient did
appear
to briefly enter stage II sleep towards the end of the tracing.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the slow and
disorganized background indicative of a mild encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infections are among
the most
common causes. Anoxia is another possibility. There were no
areas of
focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal
findings.
There were no epileptiform features noted.
