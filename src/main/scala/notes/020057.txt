Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Righ Internal Jugular Central Venous Line

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 4640**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of advanced
multi-infarct dementia, severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL who
presents from his nursing home with hypotension, hypoxia (90% on
2L), and altered mental status. Patient began to feel somewhat
unwell 4 days ago. He had increasing episodes of sundowning and
a fall after trying to enter another patient's bathroom. He also
had difficulty recognizing his grandaughter. Per nursing home
records and son's report, patient was having hallucinations
after lunch today and appeared short of breath. He underwent CXR
which was negative for volume overload, effusion, or
consolidation. UA was negative for infection. Due to persistent
shortness of breath, moderate oxygen desaturations, tachycardia
to 140 and eventual hypotension he was brought to the Emergency
Department.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.8 HR 100 BP 80/49 RR 16 97%
4L. Patient developed increased heart rates to 130 sinus
tachycardia coinciding with increased temperatures to 100.8 F.
Patient's hypotension was initially responsive to IV fluids and
he was given a total of 3150 cc NS. However, in response to IV
fluids his oxygen saturations fell to the low 80s and patient
became more somnolent. CPAP was initiated and patient's mental
status had mild improvement in alertness. Initial CXR on
presentation showed diffuse interstitial opacities concerning
for flash pulmonary edema. Intravenous fluids were then held,
central venous line was placed and levophed was started to
maintain MAPs > 60. CVP was measured at 7-8. Repeat CXR was more
concerning for possible aspiration or infection. Patient was
started on vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage. Labs were
notable for WBC 11.8, troponin of 2.54, CK MB 21, cr 1.3,
lactate 5.4, UA negative for evidence of infection. EKG showed
sinus tachycadia with new significant ST depressions in V4-6. He
was given aspirin 300 PR and started on heparin IV out of
concern for ACS. Patient received acetaminophen 650 mg, and
zofran 4 mg IV for symptomatic relief. Given concern that
patient's hypotension may be related to poor cardiac function
and recent ischemic event he was admitted to the CCU service.
.
Review of symptoms were unable to be obtained to patient's
mental status. When asked, patient denied chest pain, abdominal
pain, shortness of breath (though obviously tachypneic)

Radiology:
PCXR ([**2110-4-13**]):
IMPRESSION: Extensive interstitial opacities typically more
characteristic of volume overload and interstitial edema. Given
the presence of a normal-sized heart, alternate etiologies other
than cardiogenic are suspected such as renal failure, flash
edema from myocardial infarction, drug reaction, or other
atypical presentation. Correlate clinically.

Cardiac ECHO - TTE ([**2110-4-14**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the inferolateral wall and mild hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Critical aortic valve
stenosis. Mild regional and global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-4-15**], the severity of aortic
stenosis has progressed, left ventricular systolic function is
now depressed, and the severity of pulmonary artery hypertension
has advanced.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has severe aortic stenosis. Based on [**2105**] ACC/AHA
Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is symptomatic
(angina, syncope, CHF) and a surgical candidate, surgical
intervention has been shown to improve survival.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 4640**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of advanced
dementia, severe AS, HTN, HL who presents from his nursing home
with hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status
.
# Sepsis vs Cardiogenic shock:  Patient's persistent
hypotension, fever, elevated WBC count, and relatively low CVP
in the setting of aortic stenosis were suggestive of sepsis.
Patient's CXR is concerning for aspiration pneumonia which was
consistent with patient's clinical picture and explain the
patient's source of infection.  Patient'
