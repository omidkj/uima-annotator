of 10 with associated shortness of breath, but no nausea,
vomiting or diaphoresis.  Her husband called emergency
medical services.

grandmother died at 62 of heart disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, occasional alcohol.  Lives in
[**Location 745**] with husband.  She worked as a former bookkeeper and
secretary.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Patient in mild respiratory
distress, pursed lip breathing, using accessory muscles.
Vital signs, 95.6, 105, 88/56.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light,
oropharynx clear.  Neck, jugulovenous pressure approximately
9 cm, no thyromegaly.  Cardiovascular, tachycardiac, regular
rhythm, S1 and S2, positive S3.  Pulmonary, decreased
breathsounds with bibasilar rales, diffuse wheezes.  Abdomen,
positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  2+ pedal pulses
bilaterally.  Neurological, alert and oriented times three
moving all extremities, symmetric deep tendon reflexes.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.5/40.8/274.  Potassium 4.9,
BUN 17, creatinine 0.7, creatinine kinase 125, troponin less
than 0.01.  Electrocardiogram, sinus tachycardia, 128
beats/minute, 3 to [**Street Address(2) 5366**] elevations in V1 through V6, [**Street Address(2) 28585**] elevation in AVL.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Coronary artery disease.  Upon arrival
the patient was taken immediately to the Catheterization
Laboratory for anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction.
The catheterization revealed - 1.  One vessel coronary artery
disease with a 95% left anterior descending thrombotic lesion
involving the first major diagonal intervened upon with a
hepacoat stent.  Also found was a 60% distal right coronary
artery lesion that was not intervened upon.  2.  Increased
right-sided and left-sided pressures, with RAV of 19, RV
51/21, PCWP 35.  3.  The procedure was complicated by a
profound hypotensive episode, requiring Dopamine and
intra-aortic balloon pump.  After the procedure the patient
was transferred to the CCU.  The patient did well in the CCU.
A cardiac regimen of beta blocker and ACE was titrated and
intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued without incident.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the floor.  While
on the floor, the patient experienced a hypotensive episode
with systolic pressures in the 70s and responded to fluid
bolus.  Etiology was felt to be secondary to medications.  At
the time of discharge, the patient's antihypertensive regimen
consisted of Captopril 6.25 b.i.d. and Coreg 12.5 b.i.d.,
attempts at higher doses of Captopril were limited by her
blood pressure.  At the time of discharge, systolic pressures
ranged 90 to 110 and heartrate was 90 to 100, the patient
remained chest pain free throughout her stay.

2.  Congestive heart failure - Post procedure, the patient
had an echocardiogram which revealed - A.  Ejection fraction
of 25 to 30% with apical akinesis and severe hypokinesis of
the anterior septum and anterior wall.  She had normal right
ventricular function.  B.  Moderate to severe (3+) tricuspid
regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation.  Moderate pulmonary
hypertension was also noted.  After her catheterization the
patient was continued on heparin and was eventually started
on Coumadin for prophylaxis of left ventricular thrombus.
The patient was maintained on prn diuretics with stable
respiratory status and oxygen saturations until the day prior
to admission where she experienced worsening shortness of
breath felt to be secondary to pulmonary edema.  Therefore
the patient was initiated on a standing dose of Lasix prior
to discharge.

3.  Rhythm - The patient experienced transient episode of
atrial fibrillation during stay with no further recurrence.
She was in normal sinus rhythm at the time of discharge.

4.  Gastrointestinal - After hypotensive episode on the
floor, the patient experienced the onset of abdominal pain
and small amount of lower gastrointestinal bleeding.  Her
abdominal pain persisted and a gastrointestinal consult was
obtained secondary to concerns for ischemic colitis.
Gastrointestinal consult agreed with concern for an ischemic
event and recommended computerized tomography scan of the
abdomen.  Computerized axial tomography scan revealed a
thickened wall of the descending limb of the colon consistent
with colonic ischemic but did not reveal any pneumatosis or
free air.  General Surgery was consulted and recommended
observation of hemodynamics, intravenous fluids, and triple
antibiotics.  The patient's antihypertensives were
discontinued at this time.  She was started on Ampicillin,
Levofloxacin and Flagyl and was transferred back to the CCU
for closer monitoring.  Heparin and Coumadin were also
discontinued at this time secondary to the lower
gastrointestinal bleeding.  The patient's clinical status
rapidly improved with resolution of her abdominal pain.  She
remained abdominal pain-free throughout the rest of the stay.
At the time of discharge she was tolerating a p.o. diet, was
guaiac negative, and had her antihypertensive regimen
reinstituted without further onset of abdominal pain.

5.  Pulmonary - The patient maintained stable oxygen
saturations throughout her stay.  She experienced some
episodes of shortness of breath which were responsive to her
metered dose inhalers and nebulizers.  Additionally she
experienced an episode of shortness of breath as previously
described and this was felt to be secondary to pulmonary
edema which responded to intravenous Lasix.

6.  Renal - The patient's creatinine remained stable
throughout the stay with baseline of 0.5 to 0.6 at the time
of discharge.

7.  The patient was found to have a left adnexa cystic lesion
on computerized tomography scan done when evaluated for
ischemic colitis.  Radiology recommended this be followed up
with a pelvic ultrasound.  Ultrasound was not done at the
time of discharge, and it is recommended follow up as an
outpatient.  A Physical therapy consult was obtained who felt
the patient had decreased mobility, endurance and balance,
and therefore recommended acute rehabilitation.  The patient
was screened and subsequently discontinued to [**Hospital1 **] for
cardiac rehabilitation.

CODE STATUS:  The patient is full code.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient discharged in stable
condition without supplemental oxygen requirement.  The
patient was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation Facility.

PCI of left anterior descending.
