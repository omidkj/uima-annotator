None

History of Present Illness:
60 yo M with PMHx HIV on HAART, HCV cirrhosis, CAD s/p cath
without intervention, inclusion body myositis with baseline
weakness and diaphragmatic paralysis recently hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] to Ortho service for hip fracture s/p ORIF (D/Cd [**2168-1-22**])
rehabing at [**Hospital3 **] who presented to ED with chief
complaint of epigastric/RUQ abdominal pain and dyspnea. Patient
reports breathing is at his baseline though Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
[**Hospital1 **] sent patient to ED for evaluation considering PNA vs
PE. The patient reports he had developed an O2 requirement which
had been tapered since his hospitalization, he has been on RA
for last 4 days.  He denies fevers, chills. He denies chest
pain, DOE, orthopnea, PND, [**Location (un) **]. He only endorses dyspnea, which
he feels is baseline. He feels "congested" and he says that it
is in his "upper lobes", causing cough, productive but also
chronic and unchanged. He has never smoked, he does have asthma
and uses symbicort and combivent. He reports that he has been
compliant with his medication.

Patient notes that he developed RUQ pain evening prior to
admission for which he received morphine, he has a history of
cholelithiasis and gallbladder polyps.  He has been seen by
surgery for this at [**Hospital1 18**], but, thus far, have held off on
surgery.
.
In the ED, initial vitals: 97 90 125/87 20 95% and RN noted
patient to have speech slurring, attributed to morphine he
received at [**Hospital1 **] for gallbladder pain (he reports using
this monthly). The patient was alert, oriented x3, appropriate,
with slurred speech but CN II-XII intact, finger-nose and
cerebellar function in tact, tongue fasciculations noted and
patient with 2/5 proximal muscle weakness LE bilaterally and [**3-10**]
weakness in UE bilaterally. CTA negative for PE but did show b/l
upper lobe opacities consistent with an early PNA vs.
aspiration. RUQ US with dilated CBD but without cholelithiasis
or cholecystitis. Patient does note that he developed RUQ pain
last evening for which he received morphine, he has a history of
cholelithiasis and gallbladder polyps.
.
In the ER, patient received Albuterol and Atrovent nebs as well
as Lasix 40mg IV and potassium PO repletion. Vitals prior to
transfer 98.8 ax 115 130/86 28 90%4L. Prior to transfer to the
floor, desated to 87% on 6L. On CTA ?new PNA vs aspiration.
Prior to transfer was initially 94% facemask but then his
respiratory status improved and he was able to be weaned to
2LNC.
.
On arrival to MICU initial VS were: 99.2, 104, 126/82, 29, 96%on
2LNC, currently he says that he feels pretty well, only has pain
in his hip with repositioning.  In the MICU, was started on
Vanc/Meropenem for aspiration/hcap pneumonia.  Also, normally on
prednisone 15mg, but now on prednisone 60mg qd (day [**1-8**]) stress
dose. Of note, pt  with diaphramatic paralysis. Lots of coughing
when eating.
.
Currently, pt does not feel sob, no chest pain.  No abdominal
pain at rest.  States he has difficulty swallowing and coughs.

Imaging
.
CTA Chest [**2168-2-5**] No PE or acute aortic syndrome. Scattered
opacities in the upper lobes, new from prior, likely early
pneumonia or aspiration. No evidence of pancreatitis.
.
RUQ US [**2168-2-5**]: Limited exam due to poor acoustic penetration.
Dilated CBD better seen on concurrent CT. No son[**Name (NI) 493**]
evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
.
CXR [**2168-2-5**]: Stable band-like opacity in the left lower lung is
most compatible with chronic atelectasis. Limited study without
definite signs for acute interval changes.
.
MRCP [**2168-2-6**]:
1. Left lobe intrahepatic biliary dilatation has progressed with
obstruction at site of known hepatic tumor mass. Left
intraheptic duct measures 10mm in diameter.
2. Stable gall bladder dilatation.
3. Filling defect in lower CBD consistent with a stone (5:36)
4. CBD is normal in caliber however with no right ductal
dilatation
5. 7mm cystic lesion in pancreatic tail.
6. No peripancreatic fluid.
.
ERCP [**2168-2-7**]:
-Mild dilation of the main bile duct was noted. Multiple
irregular filling defects noted at the main bile duct and left
main duct. Otherwise, normal intrahepatic ducts.
-A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
-Large amount of blood clots, tumor.nec
