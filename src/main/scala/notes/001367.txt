Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for worsening hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 49yoM with advanced anorectal carcinoma s/p
anterior pelvic resection and colostomy, XRT and chemo with a
recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for metastatic mets to the spine
([**8-7**]) who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2156-9-2**] with 3 days of
nausea, vomiting and increasing shortness of breath and dry
cough. On initial evaluation at [**Location (un) 620**], O2 sats were found to
be 88% on RA. Admission CXR revealed what was thought to
represent b/l pneumonia so he was started on levofloxacin. WBC
was elevated to 17K with 93% neutrophils at that time. A CT
chest performed on [**9-3**] showed diffuse b/l reticularity, b/l
lower lobe dense consolidation vs. atelectasis and b/l
effusions.
.
Over the course of his [**Location (un) 620**] stay, O2 requirement increased
daily from 2L->3L-->5L and then last evening he was placed on
NRB. He received 10mg IV lasix last evening without improvement
in respiratory status. Additionally, he was tranferred to the
ICU and was placed on Bipap overnight with some decrease in WOB.
CTA chest was ordered at [**Location (un) 620**] today to r/o PE, but pt. was
unable to tolerate laying flat, less because of worsened
dyspnea, more as a result of severe back pain [**3-5**] to his bony
mets. Given suspiscion for PE, he was started empirically on
heparin gtt prior to transfer.
.
Most recent ABG prior to transfer while on NRB was 7.48/29/57.
.
ROS: + fatigue, + anorexia, no fevers and chills. He does
endorse dry mouth. No chest pain. He has been having some lower
extremity edema (L>R) without orthopnea or PND. He does say he
has been having shortness of breath over the past few days with
cough, but not prior to this. Nausea and vomiting has improved,
but not taking good PO given need for NRB/bipap. No current
lower back pain.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
# Anal/Rectal cancer, metastatic to spine T12,L1,L3,L4 and
paraspinal retroperitoneal mass around L2, mets to lungs, liver

# Rectal fissure
# Hearing impaired, wears hearing aids
.
ONC HX: Diagnosed in [**3-8**] by rectal mass resection and biopsy
demonstrating anal adenocarcinoma, he received chemoradiation
with mitomycin and 5-FU up until [**Month (only) 958**] of this [**2154**], and had an
anterior pelvic resection and pathology revealed a T3, N0
adenocarcinoma. He then received adjuvant 5-FU and leucovorin,
which was completed on [**2154-9-30**]. In he noticed some new
lumps above his left clavicle. He had a x-ray of the clavicle
done which was unremarkable. biopsy of a left cervical node that
was consistent with his anal
adenocarcinoma, and he was then treated with FOLFOX and Avastin
winter [**2155-8-2**]. Patient tolerated these treatments reasonably
well, but did experience prolonged myelosuppresion (low plts)
and due to adequate response, the treatment was stopped. Last
dose in [**3-17**], cycle initiated [**2156-3-3**].


Social History:
Married, lives in [**Location 620**] with wife, no children, works as
Physicist, cat at home. No tobacco, social ETOH.


Family History:
Mother deceased [**7-8**], stroke and pancreatic ca

Physical Exam:
PE: T 98.9 HR 128 BP 100/65 RR 30-38 O2 sat 91-96% NRB
HEENT: PERRL, dry MM
Neck: Large left sided supraclavicular LN, neck supple
CV: Sinus tachy, no mrg apprec.
Resp: Decreased BS bibasilar, crackles mid lateral lung field
(unable to sit pt. fully forward [**3-5**])
Abd: Ostomy bag with liquid brown output
Ext: Nonpitting edema LLE, no palpable cord nor calf pain, RLE
w/o edema, 2+ DP/PT pulses b/l
Neuro: CN 2-12, strength, sensation grossly intact


Pertinent Results:
[**2156-9-2**] CXR at OSH: New bibasilar patchy opacities, most likely
representing an underlying pneumonia.
.
[**2156-9-3**] CT chest from OSH: Interval increase in pulmonary
metastases
and hepatic metastases. Development of hilar and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. Interval development of bilateral pleural
effusions,
underlying atelectasis or consolidation. Interval increase in
periaortic lymphadenopathy. Development of large left
supraclavicular lymph node.
.
EKG: Sinus tachy to rate of 135, nml axis, no significant ST/T
wave changes.
.
[**2156-9-11**] bilateral LE Doppler US:  neg for DVT
.
[**2156-9-16**] LUE Doppler US: neg. for DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 49yoM with h/o of metastatic anorectal ca to
spine, liver, lungs presents with worsening hypoxia in the
setting of nonproductive cough. He was found to have probable
lymphangitic spread of metastatic disease and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for close respiratory monitoring and possible
chemotherapy. Hospital course by problem is as follows:
.
# Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory distress: In review of [**9-3**]
chest CT, reticular pattern appears c/w lymphangitic spread of
his disease and was likely the major precipitant in the
decompensation of his respiratory status. Had been on face mask,
but clinical evidence of increasing resp distress
persisted(increased work of breathing, increased O2 requirement,
tachycardia), and the patient was intubated on [**9-14**] for
worsening respiratory distress and hypercarbia.
Broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with zosyn, vancomycin, and
azithromycin was initiated on admission for a question of PNA on
admission CXR with leukocytosis and left shift.
.
# Fever: The patient spiked temperatures to 101s-102s during
hospital course. There was no clear source of fevers. Infectious
etiology was a possibility (e.g. VAP), but it was difficult to
assess for new infiltrate on CXR and the patient was on
broad-spectrum antibiotics (zosyn, vancomycin, and azithromycin)
for the duration of admission. All cultures were negative to
date. DVT/PE was considered with LUE swelling on exam; however
Doppler US was negative for DVT. Etiolgy may be related to fever
of malignancy.
.
# Sinus tachycardia: The patient demonstrated sinus tachycardia
for the duration of admission. Etiology was most likely
physiologic (tachypnea, fever, profound hypoxemia) with stable
hemodynamics. There was lack of response to IVF boluses, making
hypovolemia less likely. This was monitored closely for concern
for development of tachyarrythmia.
.
# Metastatic anorectal ca: Last chemo in 2/[**2156**]. With known
metastatic disease to bone, liver, lungs (worsening liver mets
on [**9-3**] CT as well as hilar/mediastinal LNs). XRT in [**Month (only) 205**]
performed for back pain [**3-5**] to his bony mets (low
thoracic-lumbar spine). His cancer has previously been very
chemosensitive, but since last treatment, appears to have rapid
progression of disease given imaging as outlined above. The
patient completed cycle of 5FU and G-CSF, which was tolerated
well without significant side effects; however, there was little
effect on metastatic disease during chemotherapy. During
hospital course the patient developed a leukocytosis, most
likely due to G-CSF treatment. Towards the end of his hospital
course he developed a pancytopenia, likely related to the
progression of his disease.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient is chronically thrombocytopenic
w/ platelet count 65K-154K in review of OMR labs, with evidence
of declining platelets during admission. Heparin was held
briefly for the question of HIT, but was restarted after HIT Ab
panel was negative. Most likely etiology is either progression
of metastatic disease versus 5FU treatment.
.
# ?DVT/PE: On admission the patient was started on a therapeutic
heparin drip for concern of PE given hypercoagulable state,
tachycardia, and tachypnea. He was unable to tolerate CTA per
back pain from spinal metastases. Heparin drip was discontinued
on [**2156-9-11**] after LE doppler US were negative for DVT.
.
# FEN:  The patient had evidence of hypernatremia that responded
well to free wat
