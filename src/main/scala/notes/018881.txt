Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a hx of DM who presents
from [**Hospital3 3583**] with a STEMI. She reports awaking at 6am
with 9/10 chest pain across her chest, radiating to the left arm
and jaw. She went to work today and left at 2pm due to the pain.
She presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] at 4pm and ECG showed ST
elevations and q waves in V1-V3. She was given aspirin,
metoprolol, plavix 600mg x1, heparin gtt, nitro gtt, integrilin
gtt. She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab where cardiac
cath showed acute thrombus of the proximal LAD. This was treated
with thrombectomy and BMS x 1. She was revascularized at 6:30am.

.
On arrival to the floor, she rates the pain as [**12-27**]. She denies
shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting. She states that she did
have some pain yesterday associated with vomiting but this
resolved on its own after about an hour. She has never had this
kind of pain before.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization [**2180-12-7**]: 1. Selective coronary
angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated one
vessel disease. The LMCA had no angigoraphically apparent
disease. The LAD had a total occlusion in the proximal portion
of the vessel after the D1 which had a very hig take off point.
The LAD was filled with thrombus up to the first septal branch.
The Cx had no angiographically apparent disease. The RCA had no
angigraphically apparent disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided

Echocardiogram [**2180-12-8**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to
extensive apical akinesis/dyskinesis, anteroseptal akinesis, and
anterior and inferior free wall hypokinesis. A left ventricular
apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical
free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CXR [**2180-12-8**]: Normal lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly without
obvious
overhydration. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.
Minimal Kerley B
lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely to reflect
interstitial fluid
overload. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Normal
appearance of the mediastinum and the hilar structures.

ABD US
IMPRESSION:
1. No biliary abnormalities. CBD measures 4 mm.
1. 2.7-cm right hepatic lesion, likely hemangioma.
2. Gallbladder sludge without acute cholecystitis.
3. Right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who
presents with chest pain and STEMI c/b post-STEMI pericarditis.
She presented 2-3 days after onset of MI, received a BMS and had
a course complicated by pericarditis and LV akinesis. She had
very poorly controlled DM and was kept for insulin teaching and
coumadin bridging.

BY PROBLEM

A. STEMI s/p BMS to LAD complicated by:
    Systolic Heart Failure (EF 25%)
    Pericarditis
    LV Akinesis
    Sinus Tachycardia
          An LAD thrombus was removed and BMS placed. likely [**12-20**]
days after the onset of her MI. ECHO shows extensive HK, AK in
anteroseptal, inferior and apex. EF 20%. She was in sinus
tachycardia as a result of the infarction. Patient had
persistent chest pain relieved best with nsaids x 1 and
colchicine thereafter, she also had diffuse STE indicating
pericarditis. This pericarditis later caused a true fever
(negative cultures, cxr). Ms. [**Known lastname **] eventually did well without
cochicine. She was discharged on ASA, Plavix, Simvastatin 80mg,
Lisinopril and Toprol. She was discharged on coumadin with INR
checks for LV akinesis. She was discharged on low dose
furosemide for fluid maintenance. She was given extensive CHF
and DM teaching via portugese interpreter.

B. Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2. Poorly Controlled with
complications

     Her HgA1c was 11.2. She had vision difficulties and
difficult to control blood sugars. Started on insulin and
received intensive teaching. [**Last Name (un) **] consult followed. She was
discharged on a regimen of 70/30 [**Hospital1 **]  crafted by [**Last Name (un) **]

C. Elevated LFT??????s:

     Ms. [**Known lastname **] had elevated AST/ALT on admission. As these fell,
her alk phos rose. Her bilirubin was consistently normal. A RUQ
ultrasound nl. All other w/u negative (hepatitis serologies,
AMA, [**Doctor First Name **]). The main posibilties are two. She either had a drug
reaction that led to a mixed insult with hepatocellular injury
up front and biliary injury thereafter or she was transiently
hypotensive causing hepatocellular injury vis-a-vis low hepatic
arterial pressure which would explain the predominant elevation
of alkaline phosphatase (biliary injury). All levels resolved by
discharge.

TO BE FOLLOWED
1) INR on coumadin
2) Glucose control on insulin
