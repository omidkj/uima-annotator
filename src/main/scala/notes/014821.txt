History of Present Illness:
63M with CAD s/p CABG ([**2123**]), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
20%), s/p BiV/ICD, DM2, HTN, OSA, recently started on coumadin
for L apical thrombus during recent hospitalization at [**Location (un) 620**]
([**Date range (1) 23494**]/09), sent in from vascular clinic to ED with increased
SOB, N/V, and fatigue, dry cough x 2 days. Had dyspnea overnight
more than baseline orthopnea ([**3-5**] pillows at home). Wife notes
likely dietary indiscretion 2 days prior.
.
Patient had recent admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] [**Date range (1) 23494**]/09 for
fatigue, body aches, and dyspnea. Found to have worsening EF by
ECHO, and apical thrombus for which he was started on coumadin.
Discharged on increased dose of [**Date range (1) **] and 5 day course of
levofloxacin for empiric tx of bronchitis/PNA.
.
Today in [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T99.8, HR91, BP174/113,
RR30s, O2 sat 88% -> mid 90s on NRB. Diaphoretic, found to be in
respiratory distress, worried about persistent tachypnea ->
intubated with etomidate/succ/midazolam. Denied chest pain at
this time. CXR consistent with fluid overload. ECG showed V
pacing, unchanged from prior. Given rectal ASA, SL nitro,
started on nitro gtt. Bedside ECHO showed mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with marked ventricular dilation and severe global
hypokinesis. Mild to moderate MR, mild pulm HTN. No obvious LV
clot but cannot be excluded. 1st set enzymes negative, BNP 1095.
Cards consult called, plan for admit to CCU for likely
decompensated heart failure. Planned for [**Hospital1 **], but not given
due to low BP. Foley placed, 100cc urine output on own. Vitals
on transfer were HR60, 97/53, RR20, O2 100%, vent settings CMV,
TV 500, FiO2 80, PEEP 5.
.
On arrival to CCU, patient sedated, but able to respond to
questions appropriately, denied chest pain. Able to recognize
family.
.
Full ROS unable to be obtained as patient intubated with
sedation but denies any chest pain, hemoptysis, changes in bowel
movements. Had 1 day of cough without sputum.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
TTE ([**2127-5-20**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). The left ventricular
apex is heavily trabeculated, and a left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The study is inadequate to
exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric jet
of mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with marked
ventricular dilation and severe global hypokinesis. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2127-5-6**], a left ventricular apical thrombus is
not definitively seen. A supravalvular aortic membrane is not
clearly identified.

EKG ([**2127-5-20**]):  Sinus rhythm with ventricular demand pacing.
Pacemaker rhythm - no further analysis. Since previous tracing
of [**2126-9-20**], the heart rate has increased.

CXR 1V ([**2127-5-20**]):   In comparison with study of [**10-27**], there is
huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette consistent with
cardiomyopathy. However, there has been substantial increase
engorgement of pulmonary vascularity consistent with the
clinical impression of superimposed congestive failure.
Pacemaker device remains in place.

CXR 1V ([**2127-5-21**]):  Significant interval improvement in pulmonary
edema has been demonstrated which is almost completely resolved.
Left retrocardiac opacities are most likely due to atelectasis
rather than residual pulmonary edema. Cardiomegaly is severe and
unchanged. The position of the biventricular pacemaker leads is
unchanged. There is small most likely bilateral pleural
effusion, decreased since the prior study.

TTE ([**2127-5-22**]):  There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No apical thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year-old male with coronary artery disease, dilated
cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) status-post BiV/ICD, diabetes mellitus
type II, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, recently started
on coumadin for left apical thrombus admitted with respiratory
distress secondary to decompensated heart failure. Hospital
course was as follows.

1. Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated in emergency
department for tachypnea, hypoxia. Decompensated heart failure
was most likely underlying etiology given exam consistent with
fluid overload, fluid congestion on chest radiograph, elevated
BNP, and recent history of dietary noncompliance. Patient was
diuresed and extubated within hours of admission to CCU.

2. Decompensated systolic heart failure:  Patient with known
hypertensive cardiomyopathy followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in heart
failure service. s/p BiV/ICD interrogated in [**3-10**] with no
problems. EF 15-20% from recent ECHO in [**Location (un) 62
