Hypothermia, bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous line [**11-15**]

History of Present Illness:
88 yo female with hx of Multiple Sclerosis, DM p/w hypoglycemia,
hypothermia from nursing home.  Per NH worker, patient had low
HR to 40-50 (baseline that am had been 70s) and reported that
she was feeling off-balance.  Per EMS had FS 30 and given 1M
glucagon.  Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 79210**] had a  recent UTI w/ ATBx at [**Location (un) 745**]
[**Hospital 3678**] Hospital for 7 days.  Her baseline mental status is
oriented x 3 with reported fluid conversation about current
political climate.

Patient had 2 admissions in the past 3 weeks for AMS.  One week
after [**Holiday 1451**] she developed AMS and was taken to [**Hospital 732**]
Hospital.  They thought she had a UTI but her culture was
negative.  She had a temperature during that admission of 92.0.
She returned to the [**Hospital3 5277**] and one week later was
admitted to [**Location **] Wellesly with AMS and hypothermia.  She was
altered for 3 days and had 2 CTs and an MRI which were
inconclusive.  She returned to the institution where on date of
arrival she began having AMS again.  Per NH worker, patient's MS
had retunred to baseline.
.
Upon presentation to the ED, vitals were: T 97.1, HR 55, BP
130/60, RR 18, O2Sat 96% RA. In the ED was noted to have
somnolence, though would respond appropriately to questions when
awakened.  Was given 1L fluid bolus and then started on D51/2NS
@ 100 mL/hr due to hypoglycemia. Blood cultures were drawn and a
U/A with urine culture was sent in addition to stool cultures
including clostridium dificile. A CXR showed CHF, and b/l L>R
pleural effusions but no consolidation.  Patient was empirically
given Vancomycin and Zosyn. Prior to presentation to the floor,
vitals were: T 33.7 rectally, HR irregular 40s-50s, BP 101/35,
RR 13, O2Sat 99% 2L NC.  Patient was given another 1L NS bolus
enroute.
.
ROS was unattainable due to patient's altered mental status.

CT Chest/abdomen/pelvis [**2122-11-16**]:
1. Right ureteral and bladder wall thickening with right-sided
hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The differential includes
ureteritis,
malakoplakia/leukoplakia, urothelial neoplasm. Direct
visualization when
possible is warranted.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
3. Cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 88-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis with recent
admissions for altered mental status and recent urinary
infections, who presents with bradycardia and hypothermia.

#. Septic shock: She was admitted with hypothermia and
hypotension that was thought to be due to overwhelming sepsis
from UTI; however, cultures never yielded an organism.  The most
likely source was felt to be the urinary tract, especially given
her recent admissions for UTIs.  An infectious work-up including
cultures and CXR were done and the patient was started on
Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro at admission which was changed to
Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro on [**11-15**]. Her PICC line discontinued on
[**11-14**], and Ms. [**Known lastname 79211**] tested negative for C. diff.  She
required pressor support through [**11-17**].  Her central venous
pressures were initially low.  She responded well to IVF, though
with increased pulmonary edema on x-ray; however, they were
continued due to improved clinical picture and stable O2 sats.

Over the [**Holiday **] holiday, patient took a turn for the worse;
she became less responsive, and temperatures ranged as low as
90.5.  She also refused BairHugger or more blankets stating she
"needed air."  Most likely representative of overwhelming septic
infection.  After long discussions with the family, it was felt
that maximal medical care was not improving patient's
condition/situation, and focus was changed toward optimizing
patient comfort.  Family was onboard with all medical decisions
and seemed very satisfied with care.  On [**11-21**], patient was made
"CMO" and antibiotics were withdrawn.  Patient passed peacefully
overnight on [**11-22**].

#. Pyelonephritis: The most likely source of her infection was
felt to be the urinary source.  A CT torso was performed, which
showed bilateral pleural effusions, and right hydroureter and
hydronephrosis.  Urology was consulted, and felt that the
hydroureter could be a source of infection, but could be treated
conservatively with antibiotics as long as the patient remained
stable.

#. Dyspnea:  Patient had a subjective sense of dyspnea during
admission but maintained a normal blood gas on nasal canula.  It
was felt to be due to anxiety, delirium, and exacerbated by
BairHugger.  Patient was treated symptomatically with morphine
and ativan.

#. Hypothyroidism: Continued on home levothyroxine dose as FT4
WNL.
#. Multiple sclerosis:  During hospital course, baclofen was
started (home medication) for MS.
#. HTN: Home antihyptertensives were held in the setting of
hypotension and shock.
#. PPX:  Continued DVT ppx with Lovenox 40 daily
