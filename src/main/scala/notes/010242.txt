Pertinent Results:
PRE-BYPASS: The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Severe pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is V paced and on infusions of
epinephrine and phenylephrine. Biventricular function is
preserved. The aortic valve has been replaced with a
bioprosthesis. There is no AR. The peak gradient through the
valve is approximately 14 mmHg. The aorta is intact. The
pulmonary artery catheter is in good position in the proximal
right PA. The previous valvular abnormalities and the remainder
of the examination is otherwise unchanged.
