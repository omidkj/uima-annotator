History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with PMH of cirrhosis of unclear etiology, SBP
in [**4-28**] on levofloxacin prophylaxis, gastropathy and esophageal
varices, initially admitted to MICU on [**2175-2-10**] for altered
mental status and lethargy.
.
On the morning of admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to be
confused and barely arousable with only yes/no answers. EMS was
called and he was transferred to an OSH. He vomited once upon
transfer and again at OSH, both of which were reportedly
negative for blood/coffee grounds. His wife reports that he had
no F/C, HA, abd pain, URI symptoms, cough, HA, BRBPR, melena and
was at his recent baseline health with + fatigue. At OSH he was
uncooperative and disoriented. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given that
is where his hepatologist is.
.
In the MICU, NGT was placed and lactulose administered for
presumed hepatic encephalopathy. Diagnostic paracentesis was
negative for SBP. Blood cultures grew [**1-25**] coagulase negative
staphylococcus and he was started on vancomycin on [**2175-2-11**]. Has
was also started on ceftriaxone initially for concern of UTI,
then pneumonia, which was changed to zosyn on [**2-12**] due to
concern of worsening respiratory status on ceftriaxone. Also
found to have ARF on admission which resolved to baseline but
has since been mildly increasing over the last two days.
Receiving albumin 50 g IV 1-2 times daily. Other MICU issues
have included hypercalcemia (tx fluids and lasix) and
hypernatremia.

Past Medical History:
1. Cirrhosis. NASH vs autoimmune vs alcohol related per biopsy
at outside hospital. He also has heterozygote related to
hemachromatosis
gene mutation. His biopsy results demonstrate hemosiderin
deposits.
2. History of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in [**2174-4-21**].
3. History of GI bleed in [**2174-7-22**] secondary to portal
gastropathy as well as esophageal varices.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 68 year old male with PMH of cryptogenic cirrhosis,
portal gastropathy, who was initially admitted to the MICU for
management of altered mental status most likely  from hepatic
encephalopathy whose course has been complicated by developing
pneumonia, bacteremia and acute on chronic renal failure.
.
# Hepatic Encephalopathy: His symptoms improved with
administration of lactulose and rifaximin. He did not have
evidence of SBP on diagnostic paracentesis. Possible that
infection from pneumonia and bacteremia may have also
contributed to his mental status change. With continued
rifaximin, lactuolse and antibiotics for infection
hisencephalopathy resolved.
.
# Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus Bacteremia: He was started
on Vancomycin on [**2175-2-11**].  Serial blood cultures remained
negative and he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
PICC line placed and patient discharged home on remaining 5 of
14 day course.
.
# Pneumonia: Chest xray on [**2-10**] showed left lower lobe opacity.
Patient initially started on ceftriaxone which was switched to
zosyn and then to levaquin. Patient completed a total of a 7 day
course of medications. Respiratory status remained stable and
patient was breathing comfortably at rest and with ambulation on
room air at time of discharge.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal failure: On admission creatinine was
2.5 up from a baseline of around 1.4-1.7. Cr initially improved
to baseline and then began trending up. Patient was treated with
albumin [**Hospital1 **] and then daily which did not improve renal function
so he was started on a course of midodrine and octreotide for
suspected hepatorenal syndrome. After 3 days of
midodrine/octroetide Cr improved to around 1. Midodrine and
octreotide were stopped. He was restarted on a low dose of
diuretics (furosemide 20 and spironolactone 50 daily), and his
creatinine rose to baseline levels 1.5-1.6. We decided to stop
the fursoemide; however, he will continue to take spironolactone
at a reduced dose of 50 mg daily. He will have labs checked
three days following discharge and again three days after that.
.
# Cryptogennic Cirrhosis: He was admitted with encephalopathy
and may have also developed HRS as described above. Nadolol was
held while he was on midodrine and octreotide but restarted
after these medications were stopped. Patient was also restarted
on a SBP prophylactic dose of levaquin. Patient is currently
awaiting liver [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Anemia: Patient's hematocrit 20 on admission felt to be
secondary to slow blood loss from known portal gastropathy.
Patient was transfused a total of 3 units of packed red blood
cells during this admission and hematocrit remains stable.
.
# Hypercalcemia: Patient was noted to have elevated calcium on
admission with normal PTH. Calcium has since normalized. A PTHrP
is still pending at time of discharge.
.
# Interstitial Pulmonary Fibrosis: Stable during this admission.
Patient is followed by pulmonology as an outpatient.
.
Patient was a FULL code during this admission.
