Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Superficial femoral artery stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Catheterization for stenting of right superficial femoral artery

History of Present Illness:
83 y/o diabetic with PVD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, s/p
arthrectomy of right popliteal and stent x 2 of RSFA on the day
of admission.  Post procedure course on day of admission was
complicated by unresponisve episode several hours after lower
extremity cath on the floor and respiratory failure requiring
intubation and transfer to the CCU after being found
unresponsive several hours s/p lower extremity cath.
.
Patient initially had arthrectomy of RSFA and right popliteal on
[**6-9**] and was then referred for peripheral catheterization due to
abnormal ABIs on [**10-10**]. Recent ABI was 0.58 on the right and
showed diffuse disease throughout the right lower extremity
including 75% pRSFA, 50% popliteal, and anterior tibial 75%
stenosis. Pt. has a non-healing ulcer of right heel. She has
been taking Vicodin for pain management.
.
On the day of admission, patient underwent an uncomplicated
arthrectomy of right popliteal and stent x2 of RSFA. Several
hours after procedure, she was found unresponsive, hypertensive
with SBPs to 170s, tachycardic to 130s, and pulse ox of 76% on
NRB. Patient was subsequently intubated and then taken to stat
head CT which did not demonstrate any acute findings of bleed.
She received lasix 80mg IV x 1, morphine 2mg IV x 1 for question
of CHF. Stat CXR demonstrated increased apical interstitial
markings and right greater than left pleural effusions,
consistent either with aspiration pneumonia or increased apical
interstitial edema in the setting of lying supine.
.
She remained intubated for 2 days in the ICU and tolerated
extubation well without complication.  Imaging of her brain was
obtained which did not reveal acute stroke.  Additionally, she
was hypotensive upon transfer to the CCU with mildly decreased
SVR and mildly increased CO most c/w distributive shock.
Although she was afebrile and without elevated WBC count, given
the above picture, she was started on vancomycin and zosyn.
Urine and sputum cultures revealed no growth.  Blood cultures
reveal NGTD.

Pertinent Results:
[**2157-11-14**] Cardiac cath:
1. Severe R SFA stenosis and a severe focal right popliteal
artery
stenosis.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the R SFA.
3. Successful atherectomy of the right popliteal artery.
.
[**2157-11-15**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
regional/global biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
Heel x-ray:
1) Focal osteopenia and slight ill definition of the posterior
calcaneus deep to the ulcer.  The differential diagnosis
includes prior debridement vs. osteomyelitis.
2) 1 cm lucent focus along dorsum of talus, not fully evaluated
here -- this is non-aggressive in appearance and most likely
represents an erosion, cyst, or enchondroma.
.
CT head:
1.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  Evidence of prior infarct in the right frontal lobe, and
possible chronic small vessel ischemia in the left frontal lobe.
 Also no evidence of acute infarction is seen, please note that
diffusion-weighted MRI is highly more sensitive for acute or
supra-acute infarction.
3.  Possible aneurysm at the right carotid siphon.
.
MRI/MRA brain:
1.  No evidence of acute infarction.
2.  Right frontal encephalomalacia, consistent with chronic
infarction. According to the patient's online medical record,
these findings correspond with a known cerebrovascular accident
in [**2154**].
3.  Bilateral chronic small vessel infarction, with a single
tiny, chronic hemorrhagic residuum in the left centrum
semiovale.
4.  Stable appearance of the major tributaries of the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**], again revealing a hypoplastic left posterior
communicating artery and A1 segment of the left anterior
cerebral artery.
.
MRI Foot: 1.  Large soft tissue ulcer over the posterolateral
heel with adjacent marrow changes amd cortex loss in the
calcaneus concerning for osteomyelitis. 2.  Nonspecific
subchondral signal changes surrounding the tarsometatarsal and
talonavicular joints likely reflect degenerative/early
neuropathic changes.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 y/o diabetic woman with PVD s/p arthrectomy of right
popliteal and stent x 2 of RSFA admitted to the CCU on [**2157-11-14**]
after being found unresponsive without clear etiology.
.
# Respiratory Failure:  On the day of admission, shortly after
her right SFA procedure, she was found unresponsive and
desaturated on a nonrebreather.  She was intubated for airway
protection and transferred to the ICU.  She was extubated 2 days
later on [**2157-11-16**] without complication.  The cause of her
initial episode of unresponsiveness is not entirely clear, but
she was without respiratory compromise since her original
episode.
.
# Mental Status Change:  As above, etiology for patient's acute
mental status change in which she was found unresponsive in not
entirely clear. Differential diagnosis includes TIA
(particularly given patient's prior stroke in right frontal
lobe) or seizure although she has no prior history and an EEG
performed was negative.  Head CT and brain MRI were negative for
acute stroke.  She has mild dementia at baseline and was back to
her baseline mental status at the time of discharge.
.
#  Right foot ulcer: Patient was admitted with stable right foot
ulcer with concern for possible osteomyelitis.  ESR was 56-->70,
CRP 86.4-->61.9.  Vascular surgery saw the patient.  Initially,
chemical debridement was initiated with Accuyzyme.  An MRI of
the foot was performed to evaluate for osteomyelitis and
revealed changes potentially consistent with osteomyelitis.  She
was taken to the OR for debridement by podiatry.  No
osteomyelitis was found in the OR.  The patient was switched
from IV Vanc/Zosyn to PO Augmentin for 14 days and she will f/u
with podiatry in 1 week and continue Vac dressing with changes
every 4 days.  Final cultures and pathology reports are pending
at the time of discharge and should be followed up by the
patient's primary care doctor.
.
#  Peripheral Vascular Disease:  The patient is s/p LE
angiography and peripheral stent placement (RSFA).  Lower
extremity noninvasive
