Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stents x2 to left
circumflex artery


History of Present Illness:
76 y/o F with PMH of CAD s/p CABG in [**2146**], redo in [**2173**]
((LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA 'y' graft to OM 'Y' graft to PDA), CKD with
baseline Cr of 2.6 transferred to CCU in setting of ACS s/p DES
x2 to native LCx.

Patient had sudden onset typical angina ([**8-31**] chest discomfort,
dyspnea, weakness) at 11am while taking out her trash. She
initially presented to OSH where EKG uninterpretable in setting
of v-paced rhythm. 1st set of enzymes were negative, but second
set revealed troponin 0.2 (increased from 0.06), MB 18, and CK
179; pro BNP 1573.  Patient started on heparin gtt, given ASA
325mg (plavix deferred as on chronic therapy). Pain was treated
with morphine - reportedly made her feel worse- and nitro gtt.
At time of transfer, patient complained of persistant chest
discomfort, rated [**1-1**].

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient complained of persistent
discomfort despite high nitro gtt causing SBP in 80-90s.  She
was taken semi-emergently to the cath lab and reloaded with
plavix.  Angiography revealed thrombus in prox Cx which was
treated with prox and mid DES.  Both grafts to cx were occluded;
the LIMA and SVG to RCA remained patent.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for [**2-24**] pillow orthopnea.
She denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
# CARDIOLOGY

[**2-19**] Cardiac Catheterization
.................

[**2178-2-20**] TTE
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %)
secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior,
posterior, and lateral walls, and of the apex. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is not well
seen. The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to prior study of [**2174-2-28**], left ventricular
ejection fraction and mitral regurgitation now much worse.

# RADIOLOGY

[**2-20**] ULTRASOUND OF RIGHT FEMORAL CATH SITE
IMPRESSION: Small collateral coming off the right common femoral
artery, but no evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm. No
evidence of hematoma.

[**2-21**] CXR (PA/Lat)
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly improved interstitial edema. 2. Small bilateral
pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity which may
represent atelectasis, although consolidation cannot be
excluded.

[**2-23**]
ECHO
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mild aneurysm/akinesis of the basal inferior
septum, inferior, and inferolateral walls, and hypokinesis of
the more distal inferior , distal lateral, and apical segments.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The aortic
valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-2-20**],
there has been interim improvement in systolic function of the
distal 2/3rds of the inferior/inferolateral wall and global
LVEF.

((LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA 'y' graft to OM 'Y' graft to PDA), CKD with
baseline Cr of 2.6 transferred to CCU in setting of ACS/MI s/p
DES x2 to native LCx.

# STEMI/CAD: Patient presented with ACS/STEMI with elevated
cardiac enzymes and an uninterpretable EKG. Cardiac
catheterization revealed a 95% occlusion proximally in the LCx
with filling defect/thrombus; the patient received [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.
CK-MB peaked at 15.8.  She has been chest pain free since cath.
Post-cath, she was noted to have a femoral bruit, however there
was no evidence of aneursym on right groin ultrasound. Patient
received aspirin 325mg, Plav
