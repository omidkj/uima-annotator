RLE ischemia

History of Present Illness:
This was a 71-year-old male who had recently
been diagnosed with left lower extremity DVT and he was also
found to have right foot ischemia and was taken for angiogram
for angioplasty and stenting of a very long segment
throughout his right leg. The patient was discharged home but
developed a cool foot and was re-admitted for heparinization.
The patient had a duplex showing his posterior tibial artery
was open and therefore the decision was made to take the
patient for bypass.

pain, cold sensation. Patient s/p Stent RT EIA,
Angioplasty/stent SFA,[**Doctor Last Name **],PT on [**2135-6-21**]. IVF/mucomyst started
for possible angio in am. Started on Heparin gtt.
[**Date range (2) 30992**]: VSS, no events. Pain controlled with oxycodone.
Heparin gtt adjusted per ptt. RT PT/DP pulses absent. Angio
cancelled. Will obtain NIAS, duplex and plan for surgery.
[**6-27**]: RLE Duplex showing patent iliac, CFA, proximal SFA,
occluded distal SFA, [**Doctor Last Name **] and PT. NIAS: Poor/flat waveforms RT
metatarsal, RT iliac, B/L SFA and Tibial Dz. RT DP/PT pulses
absent.
[**6-28**] Duplex: The right posterior tibial artery appears to be
occluded at the mid calf level. Just beyond this however, it
regains patency but as expected, shows extremely low flows with
monophasic waveforms. This can be visualized to the level of the
ankle.
[**6-29**]: Preop for [**2135-6-30**]. Transfused 1uPRBCs for HCT 24 (post HCT
29.6).

saphenous vein graft. Extubated and transferred to PACU. Pain
controlled with Dilaudid PCA. Post K- 6.0. Treated with
insulin/D50. ECG WNL. Transferred to VICU.
