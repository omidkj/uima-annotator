CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1511**] is a 58-year-old woman
with a 5-day history of chest pain and dyspnea on exertion,
progressively worsening.

She went to see her primary care physician who heard [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**3-25**]
murmur.  She had a low-grade fever at this time, and an
echocardiogram performed at [**Hospital3 15174**]
revealed severe mitral regurgitation, inferior hypokinesis,
and no vegetation.

She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.  Left main
coronary artery revealed a 40%, left anterior descending
artery with minor irregularities, left circumflex was
diminutive.  The right coronary artery was a large dominant
vessel with diffuse irregularities.  The middle right
coronary artery was 95% stenosed.   A stent was placed, and
post stent examination revealed 0% stenosis.

Ms. [**Known lastname 1511**] was placed on aspirin, Plavix, and Integrilin for
eight hours, nitroglycerin, and started on an ACE inhibitor.
Ms. [**Known lastname 19161**] subsequent hospital course was remarkable for
fever and an elevated white blood cell count.  Sputum
cultures grew out Escherichia coli which were sensitive to
Levaquin and ceftazidime.  Ms. [**Known lastname 1511**] was double-covered with
both Levaquin and ceftazidime for this pneumonia.  Ms. [**Known lastname 1511**]
continued to be followed, but her condition was not improving
following stent revascularization.  Therefore, she was
subsequently evaluated for surgical intervention.

for coronary artery bypass graft times two and mitral valve
replacement.  The coronary artery bypass graft grafts
included left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery and saphenous vein graft to right coronary
artery.  The mitral valve was replaced with a #25 CarboMedics
mechanical valve.  The operation was performed without
complications, and Ms. [**Known lastname 1511**] was subsequently transferred to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

She was weaned off drips and extubated.  She was
hemodynamically stabilized and transfused packed red blood
cells due to a decreased hematocrit.

On postoperative day two, Ms. [**Known lastname 1511**] was transferred to the
floor. Coumadin therapy was started, and Plavix was
