Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8104**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental status change

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
46yo gentleman with history of Crohn's on prednisone, type 2 DM
on insulin, depression with h/o suicidal gestures, and CAD s/p
DES to LAD who presented with altered mental status.

Over the last two days, he has been markedly thirsty, and has
started drinking large amounts of milk or chocolate milk.  He is
not sure if he took his dose of lantus the night before
admission and admits to skipping sugar checks during the day.
+Polyuria.  +Cough productive of yellow sputum x 1 week.
+Nausea but no vomiting.  He has been having 2 BMs per day,
which is much better than is normal for his Crohn's.

He walked a block to CVS in order to buy cigarettes and fill his
prescriptions.  He was walking over to smoke his cigarette when
he noticed he was feeling unsteady.  He leaned against a tree
and then slumped down to the ground.  A bystander came to his
aid and EMS was called.

In the ED, initial VS were 100.2 (Tmax 102.2)   174/100   140
18   96%.  He denied CP or SOB.  He was profusely diaphoretic.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal but he had increased muscle tone.
He was empirically treated with stress dose hydrocortisone and
valium.  Somewhat later, he became increasingly somnolent.  He
received narcan, and just as the team was about to intubate him,
he sat up on the table and was entirely awake.  He had a VBG,
which was 7.33/49/60 with a lactate of 4.7.  EKG did not show
acute ischemia, and intervals were normal.  Head CT was negative
and CXR showed what was thought to be LLL pneumonia, so he was
given vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Just prior to transfer to
the ICU, he was given 10 units of IV insulin for BS 373.  He
received 2.5 L IVF in ED.

Upon arrival to the ICU, he wanted to have a bowel movement and
he asked immediately for some water to drink.  He specifically
denied taking any extra or new medications.  He states his mood
has been good lately and that he is not suicidal: "I would not
walk in front of a bus, but if a bus came and hit me, that would
be okay."

CXR [**11-9**]:
Heterogeneous left lung base opacity concerning for pneumonia.
Right lung base atelectasis. Follow up radiographs after
treatment is
recommended to document resolution of this finding.

CT Head without contrast [**11-9**]: FINDINGS: There is no
intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline
structures, or evidence of major vascular territorial infarcts.
Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The basilar
cisterns are symmetric. There is no fracture. Paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are well- aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Altered Mental Status:  DDx at admission hyperosmolar
hyperglycemic state (though not hyperosmolar at admission), drug
overdose (TCA level high at admission), suicide attempt, sepsis,
serotonin syndrome, or seizure.  Patient's home medications of
Prednisone and metoprolol could also contribute.  Most likely
developed pneumonia, which caused hyperglycemia.  He then
developed marked dehydration, which led to his presentation.
Pt. had a recent w/u for questionable seizure at OSH.  Patient
was given 3L NS in the ICU.  Sedating medications (fentanyl,
temazepam, tizanidine) were held.  Treatment was started for CAP
with levofloxacin (day 1 = [**11-9**]) for planned 5 day course.  He
was treated with tamiflu X 2 days until Influenza swab was
negative. Urine legionella antigen was negative, as was a NCHCT.
His respiratory status and mental status remained stable during
this admission and he was discharged home.

# Hyperglycemia and Type 2 DM: Patient was put on a sliding
scale with home glargine (decreased dose 12/9 am as patient not
taking good PO).  Serum electrolytes in the ICU were checked and
repleted twice daily. He continued to have difficult to control
blood surgars during this hospitalization. Insulin was
increased. Morning blood glucose was in the 100s, but by noon
glucose was often as high as 400, but with no gap. Patient was
seen by nurses exhibiting nonadherence to recommended diet,
often with overconsumption of diabetic products.

# Suspected Community Acquired PNA:   Started on levofloxacin x
5 days (day 1 = [**11-9**]).

# Acute Respiratory Acidosis: Likely due to hypoventilation in
setting of altered mental status.  Anion gap at admission 14
with a lactate of 4.7, suggesting he may have had a concurrent
anion gap acidosis, howeve
