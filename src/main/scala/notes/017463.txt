Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy with attempted balloon dilatation of Nissen
fundoplication / gastroesophageal junction.


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 450**] [**Known lastname **] is a 41 yo woman with a history of DM type 2,
HTN, HL, stroke, OSA, spinal stenosis, arthritis, asthma, and
GERD here with left sided chest pain radiating to her left arm.
The patient was in her USOH until 3 months prior to this
admission when she noted intermittent palpitations and chest
discomfort. The patient was not concerned about this chest
discomfort until about 2 weeks prior to this admission when she
noticed increasing left sided chest pain accompanied by
worsening dyspnea and wheezing causing her to decrease her
mobility, which is low at baseline. 2 days prior to admission,
the patient noted worsening of the left sided chest pain growing
from [**4-5**] to [**9-5**] pain, continued radiation down the left arm,
and associated diaphoresis and decrease in her peak flow from
350 at baseline to 170s even after using albuterol nebulizers.
Of note, patient typically uses 3 albuterol nebulizers as need
for wheezing over the course of the day. Over the past 2 days,
she required up to 4 nebulizers in one morning and noticed
minimal improvement of her symptoms. The patient's chest pain
was constant and distinct from the symptoms of reflux associated
with GERD. Of note, the patient has been hospitalized in the
past for this type of chest pain.
.
The patient was brought by EMS to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. En route she
received NTG, aspirin with only minimal improvement of chest
pain. In the ED she was afebrile, but tachycardic to 100s. She
received IV fluids, morphine for pain control with good effect.
She also received IV dilaudid and had an allergic reaction which
was treated with benadryl with good effect. She was admitted to
the medicine floor for further workup
.
On ROS, patient denied headache, changes in vision, fever,
chills, night sweats, abdominal pain, changes in her chronic
back pain or changes in her neuropathy, left sided weakness.

IMAGING
.
[**2150-8-2**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with bibasilar
atelectasis, but no superimposed acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality.
.
[**2150-8-3**] LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: IMPRESSION: No
evidence of DVT of bilateral lower extremities.
.
[**2150-8-4**] VENTILATION PERFUSION SCAN: IMPRESSION: Limited study
with normal perfusion and ventilation. No evidence of PE.
.
[**2150-8-5**] BARIUM SWALLOW:IMPRESSIONS: 1. Limited exam, but no
gross abnormalities of the esophagus or proximal stomach. 2.
Intact gastric fundoplication, with moderately delayed passage
of barium through the distal esophagus intothe stomach. 3. No
gastric emptying seen during 10-minute exam.
.
[**2150-8-8**]: FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH TO EVALUATE FOR
Fever after esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. The lung volumes remain low, with no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax as well as with no focal
consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Mild volume overload cannot
be excluded.
