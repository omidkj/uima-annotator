History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F presenting from home c/ h/o COPD p/w increased WOB
for 1 week. No chest pain, no fevers but did have nonproductive
cough. At baseline she is not on home oxygen during the day but
does use it sometimes at night. Pt reported that over the last
week she's had worsening SOB which has required her to sleep in
the chair. She reports taking her lasix and other meds but notes
that although she was using her inhalers more than usual b/c of
her SOB, she wasn't having much improvement. Pt's daughter noted
that pt recently celebrated her 91st birthday and received many
flowers, concerned these may have exacerbated breathing. Pt
denies abdominal pain, no chest pain or palpitations, no
headaches, no fevers, but pt acknowledges episode of increased
urination (no burning) which is unusual for her as well as
hoarseness (but no sore throat).

In the ED, initial VS: 98.2 80 158/49 34 94% RA. Pt had diffuse
wheezes on exam and chronic LE edema. Labs significant for urine
with 30 protein, few bacteria, no WBC, neg nitrite. Lactate 2.3.
BNP 3038. WNC 16.1 with N85, no bands; unclear what the timing
of steriods is to WBC rise. Creatinine 1.2 (baseline 1-1.3 as of
late).

CXR showed enlarged pulmonary vascular congestion, b/l small
chronic efffusions. EKG: Sinus, RBBB with LAFB, similar to
prior. She was given Albuterol neb, Ipraptropium,
Methylprednisoline 125mcg and Furosemide 20mg IV Lasix and put
out 100 cc. She was started on bipap; off X 15mins and still
breathing RR 28-30 but did not desat with sats 96% on 4L. BP and
HR unchanged. 2 PIVs.

On the floor, VS T:98 BP: 145/56 P:85 R:17 O2: 96% 3L NC. Pt
appeared comfortable but at times breathless when talking for
long stretches. Had expiratory wheezes on exam, chronic LE edema
per pt not significantly changed.

Review of systems:

urination. Hands chronically weak, sometimes numbness which has

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2139-5-26**] 10:09 AM
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Mild central vascular engorgement
is noted.
There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Mediastinal and
hilar
contours are within normal limits and unchanged from prior. Mild
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Hyperexpansion
and flattening of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with known
history of COPD.

IMPRESSION:
1. New mild central pulmonary vascular congestion
2. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
3. Hyperexpansion consistent with COPD, stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
SHORTNESS OF BREATH, HYPOXIA: likely contribution from both COPD
flare and volume overload related to diastolic CHF.  She was
treated for COPD with acute exacerbation with a prednisone
taper.  In addition she was treated with azithromycin and
nebulizers inpt.  She was given 80mg IV lasix initially then
transitioned to her home diuretics and sent home with a low salt
diet and instructions to weigh herself daily and call her PCP
should she gain > 3 pounds.

HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: Given HR in the low 50s some of the time
while inpt her atenolol was reduced to 25mg po daily.

HYPERCALCEMIA:  PTH very elevated, likely hyperparathyroidism
from a hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland.  Despite CKD her phos
is normal so this is unlikely secondary hyperparathyroidism.
The patient understands this diagnosis and will need to see
endocrinology for further investigation and management.

PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE: PPI continued.
