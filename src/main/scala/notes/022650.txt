History of Present Illness:
71M with coronary artery disease s/p CABG, CHF, CKD (baseline Cr
[**3-30**]), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM2 on insulin, complains of
worsening dyspnea in the past few days.

Pt was recently admitted on [**2191-10-27**] for CHF exacerbation, and
[**Date range (1) 17344**] for NSTEMI and possible pneumonia. He was treated with
levofloxacin at home. After discharge, pt was ambulating in the
house, and will become dyspneic on exertion. Over the weekend,
he became increasingly dyspneic and lightheaded. He also has an
intermittent achy flank / RLQ pain, which has been attributed to
muscle spasm for which he takes hydromorphine. Pt otherwise
denies fever, chill, cough, chest pain, N/V/D. There is no
recent sickness or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] was noted to have slightly
increased appetite compared to the last a couple of weeks, and
probably decreased urine output despite lasix use over the
weekend. His edema in legs has been stable.
.
Pt went to the clinic today, and was instructed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 106365**] to go to the ED if his symptoms worsens, which was
the case.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt's BPs 90s/50s, trigger to 80s after morphine
dosing. BP resolved after 1L fluid. His lab showed WBC 31,
stable Hct, potassium of 5.8, worsening Cr to 5.9, Troponin of
1.01 and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 106366**]. Chest X-ray showed worsening right side
opaciy, concerning for mass vs effusion. CT head showed no
evidence of hemorrhage.
Bedside ultrasound showed no pericardial effusion. He was given
aspirin, started on heparin given the concern for NSTEMI. He
aslo received zosyn, levaquin, and vanco.
.
On arrival to the MICU, Pt's VS are T: 95.6 BP: 106/61 P: 60 R:
18 O2: 100% on 2L nc. There was no pulsus on the exam.

Lower extremity US: No lower extremity DVT with subcutaneous
edema in the calves.

ECHO [**11-7**]: IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of
endocarditis. Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. If clinically indicated,
a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular
vegetations. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2190-11-15**], the findings are similar.

CT Head W/O contrast:
Final Report:
INDICATION: 71-year-old male with non-STEMI and lung mass
concerning for
malignancy. Question intracranial hemorrhage prior to heparin
therapy.

COMPARISON: [**2188-6-16**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous non-contrast axial images were acquired
through the
brain, with multiplanar reformations.

FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
edema, or shift of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. Ventricles and sulci are
prominent, consistent with age-related involution. There is no
major vascular territorial infarct. Suprasellar and basilar
cisterns are patent.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. There
are vascular calcifications in the cavernous carotid and
vertebral arteries. Globes and soft tissues are unremarkable.
Incidental note is made of leftward deviation of the nasal
septum.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Chest X-ray [**11-8**]:
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The
heart is of top normal size with a stable cardiomediastinal
silhouette. Pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged with mild
bilateral pulmonary edema with associated right pleural
effusion. Known pleural and pulmonary nodules are better
evaluated on CT. No pneumothorax. Atrial biventricular AICD
pacer leads follow their expected course. Sternotomy wires are
aligned.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged pulmonary vascular congestion with
pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion.

#Pleural Fluid: Negative for malignant cells

#CT-guided Pleural Biopsy:  Peliminary Report:  Positive for
malignancy

Brief Hospital Course:
