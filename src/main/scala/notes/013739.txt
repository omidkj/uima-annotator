CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Portable upright chest radiograph shows interim removal of the
patient's endotracheal tube compared to yesterday's exam.
Right-sided Cordis introducer with coaxial catheter is in
unchanged position. Minimal streaky density is seen in the left
retrocardiac region, and less so at the right lung base with an
appearance more suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis than
pneumonia, however, if symptoms continue, repeat PA and lateral
views may be revealing. Cardiac size and mediastinal contours
are stable. Callus at healed rib fractures bilaterally is again
noted. Calcification is seen in the arch of the aorta with
calcified plaque at both carotid arteries and both subclavian
and axillary arteries as well.

CONCLUSION:
1. Maintained inspiratory volumes status post extubation.
Minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the bases without evidence
of pneumonia. If symptoms continue, PA and lateral views may be
helpful.
2. Atherosclerosis.

This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a
speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these
guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you
otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any
questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.

ACTIVITY:

There are no specific restrictions on activity. You should be as
active as is comfortable. Some fatigue is expected for the first
several weeks. Leg swelling is typical following this type of
surgery and can be controlled by elevating your leg above the
level of your heart when you are not walking.

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).

New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.

Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.

Exercise:

Limit strenuous activity for 4 weeks.

No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 7 days.

BATHING/SHOWERING:

You shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A clear
dressing may cover your leg incision and this should be left in
place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time and wash
your incision(s) gently with soap and water. Dissolving sutures,
which do not have to be removed, were probably used.

If you have staples these will be removed on your follow-up
appointment.

WOUND CARE:

Sutures / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are
not, an appointment will be made for you to return for
removal.).

When the sutures / staples are removed the doctor may or may not
place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.
These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on.
If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off
with warm water and soap in the shower.

Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for
two weeks after surgery.

MEDICATIONS:

Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the
medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a
new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every
