HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
female with an extensive history of coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2130**]. [**Doctor First Name 4796**] to
left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal one, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal two,
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
Multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.  Status post
NST EMI on [**8-30**], requiring CCU admission after stents to
obtuse marginal two, LMCA, left circumflex and rescue jailed
left anterior descending.  Hospital course was complicated by
gallstone pancreatitis, status post recent admission on [**11-9**]
for recurrent substernal chest pain. Repeat catheterization
on [**11-9**] revealed saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
stent; relook catheterization on [**2133-11-12**] with no
intervention.

She presented today to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with
substernal chest pain. Reports feeling in her usual state of
health after discharge from [**Hospital1 188**] on [**11-13**].  Also, history of chest tightening,
intermittent throughout the day, occurring at rest.  This
a.m., she was lying in bed at around 7:30 a.m. when she had
the onset of eight out of ten chest pain, substernal anginal
equivalent while at rest.  She took sublingual nitroglycerin
which decreased pain to four to five out of ten and then
changed to jaw pain.  Jaw pain resolved after 5 to 10
minutes.  This recurred at 11 a.m., again with mild decrease
in pain with subinguinal nitroglycerin times two.  She was
not admitted with any nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,
shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, weakness or
syncope.  When pain recurred, she called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her
cardiologist, who advised her to come to the Emergency
Department.  She went to [**Hospital3 417**] via EMS.  She
received aspirin 325 mg en route.

On arrival to [**Hospital3 417**], she had a heart rate of 58;
blood pressure of 92/47. There, she became chest pain free
after sublingual nitroglycerin, Morphine sulfate 2 mg, 50 cc
bolus and started nitroglycerin drip.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for emergent cardiac
catheterization.  Of note, electrocardiogram at [**Hospital3 418**] with primary AV block; one to two mm ST elevations
inferiorly with no change from [**2133-9-6**] electrocardiogram.
Borderline AV block noted on electrocardiograms from [**11-9**] to
[**11-13**], all three admissions.  Of note, the patient was also
restarted on Atenolol during the last admission.

The patient went for cardiac catheterization.  Hemodynamics
of cardiac output were 4.88; cardiac index of 2.49; pulmonary
capillary wedge 22; right atrial pressure of 20; aortic
pressure of 80 over 31.  Pulmonary artery 46 over 22.  Mean
of 31. Right ventricle 46/12; end diastolic of 22.

Angiography showed right dominant system with stent; left
LMCA normal; Left anterior descending with 70% ostial
stenosis; mid occluded; known to fill via patent left
internal mammary artery.  Left circumflex without instant
narrowing; normal except for occluded grafted obtuse
marginal, unchanged.  Right coronary artery:  Known occluded.
Distal vessel fills via saphenous vein graft.  Unchanged
severe distal disease.  Saphenous vein graft to RPDA normal;
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending not
injected; known normal [**11-14**].  Saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal one normal.  Minimal instant disease.  Severe
disease in obtuse marginal, distal to graft.

In light of the patient's decreased pressure and elevated
right heart pressures with preserved cardiac output,
cardiology was concerned for sepsis. The patient was
transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit with PA catheter
in place for monitoring. She was started on Levaquin with in
catheterization laboratory to increase blood pressure.  On
arrival, the patient denies fevers, myalgia, chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations, history of cough, sputum
or hemoptysis.  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, but
several formed bowel movements times four on [**2133-11-18**]. No
sick contacts, no headaches, no visual changes, no neck
stiffness. No dysuria. Increased frequency.  No abdominal
pain or tenderness.  No skin rashes or lesions.  Positive
chills yesterday.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.) Coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2130**]; with saphenous
vein graft to obtuse marginal one; saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal two; saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery; left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending.  Status post myocardial infarction in
[**8-30**].  NSTMI.  Status post multiple pulmonary cardiac
interventions.  [**6-29**] stent to saphenous vein graft and left
circumflex; [**10-29**] left circumflex LMCA; [**1-30**] percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex.
Status post repeat catheterization on [**11-9**] with saphenous
vein graft to obtuse marginal stent.  Status post relocation
of catheterization on [**11-12**] with no interventions.  Stents in
LM; obtuse marginal two patent.  Left anterior descending
with proximal 60% stenosis and totally occluded.  Left
circumflex was widely patent.  Totally occluded obtuse
marginal one.  Right coronary artery totally occluded.
