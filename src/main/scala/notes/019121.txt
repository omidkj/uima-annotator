HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old
male who at 12:30 a.m. on [**2165-6-21**] presented with the worse
headache of his life at an outside hospital.  He complained
of positive nausea, vomiting, and was diaphoretic, and felt cool
and clammy. The patient was awake, alert and oriented times three
at presentation.  He became obtunded and apneic episode at that
point.  He was sedated and intubated at 2:17 a.m. on arrival.
The patient's CT showed a large intracranial hemorrhage
around the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] going both posteriorly and
anteriorly.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**].

1. Protonix.
2. Coreg.
3. Lipitor.
4. Zestril.
5. Aspirin.
6. Lisinopril.
7. Prilosec.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease.

Myocardial infarction.

Hypertension.

He has an automatic internal defibrillator in place.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Positive for a coronary artery bypass
graft and pacemaker placement.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Pulse of
60.  Blood pressure 133/94.  Respirations 20.  100 percent.
He is intubated.  The patient is heavily sedated and
intubated upon arrival.  No response to painful stimulating.
He had a positive gag, positive corneal and negative
Babinski. He flexed arms to pain bilaterally and localized
pain to his lower extremities.  He had increased tone in his
lower extremities and decreased tone in his arms.  CT showed
blood from a bibasilar hemorrhage, blood in the basilar
cistern, lateral ventricles, posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] with third and fourth ventricle dilation.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count was 10.8,
hematocrit 39.6, platelets 151, INR 1.2, PT 13.6, PTT 21.2,
sodium was 138, 3.9, 108 for his chloride, sugar was 167.  CK
was 207, CKMB was 5, troponin was less then .001, amylase was
75.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Neurosurgery Service under Dr.[**Name (NI) 9224**] service.  Blood pressure
was to be kept at less then 130.  He was started on Dilantin 100
mg q 8 and head of bed was kept greater then 30 degrees.
Neuro checks were done q one hour and placed on strict I and
O.  A CTA was performed, which showed a vertebral artery
aneurysm.  On [**2165-6-21**] at 11:30 in the morning Mr. [**Known lastname 93727**] went
to the neuro interventional angio suite where he underwent a
cerebral angiogram.  He was found to have wide neck aneurysm
of a heavily calcified left intracranial vertebral artery
proximal to the vertebral basilar junction.  He found that there
was no right vertebral flow and his bilaterally ICAs did not have
an aneurysm.  He is brought back to the Intensive Care Unit.
His blood pressures kept less then 130 and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**]
discussed possible coiling options with the [**Known lastname 93727**] family at
that time.  Postoperatively after his diagnostic angio Mr.
[**Known lastname 93727**] was found not to open his eyes to sternal rub or
following commands.  His pupils were 4 mm, sluggish,
reactive.  He had a positive corneal and gag reflex.  No
blink to visual threat.  He had increased tone in his lower
extremities.  He localized to pain in all four extremities
moving his legs spontaneously.  At 8:30 p.m. on [**6-21**] he was
brought back to the interventional neuro angio suite where he
had a stent deployment times two and coil-through-
stent embolization of his left vertebral artery aneurysm.  Before
the procedure he had a ventriculostomy drain placed without any
complications. Postoperatively, his blood pressure is kept in the
less then 120 range.  His drain is open at 15.  He is started on
Plavix 75 mg q day and aspirin 325 mg po q day.  On [**2165-6-22**] his
intracranial pressures were ranging from 9 to 11.  He had
been sedated at that point.  His pupils were bilateral at 2
with a conjugate gaze, moving spontaneously on the right,
following commands in his upper and his lower extremities.
He continued to receive intravenous Dilantin.  His Dilantin
was 8.3 that day.  His drain was kept at 15 cm.

Later in the day on [**6-22**] he had his AICD interrogated and it
was found to be functioning normally.  It is a single lead
ICD.  After his coiling procedure Mr. [**Known lastname 93727**] was placed on
heparin.  On [**6-23**] Mr. [**Known lastname 93727**] was weaned from the ventilator
and extubated.  He tolerated his extubation without
difficulty.  CAT scan on [**6-23**] showed a large amount of
subarachnoid hemorrhage within the basilar cistern and third
and fourth ventricles as well as the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**].  It
appeared stable from previous  CAT scans.  There was a small
amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the sulci
bilaterally. The ventricular size appeared decreased compared
with previous studies.  Also on [**6-24**] Mr. [**Known lastname 93727**] had periods of
congestive heart failure.  Chest x-ray showed failure.  He
was given Lasix and pan cultured and did better post
receiving Lasix.  He was started on tube feeds.  He continued
to have Nipride to keep his blood pressure in the below 130
range and he continued to receive heparin at 700 units an
hour.  At this point he had no positive cultures.  On [**6-25**]
Mr. [**Known lastname 93728**] eyes would open spontaneously to stimulation.  He
showed his thumbs bilaterally, wiggled his toes bilaterally.
He was receiving Lasix prn.  He received Dilantin to have his
Dilantin level greater then 10. He continued to have a drain
in at 15 mm.  Cerebral spinal fluid showed no microorganisms.
He had been ruled out for an myocardial infarction.  On [**6-25**]
his heparin drip was stopped and his femoral sheath was
discontinued per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**].  Cardiology also saw Mr. [**Known lastname 93727**]
for his continuing problems with congestive heart failure and
they felt that he was volume overloaded and they agreed to
keep his volume status balanced and to aim for negative fluid
balance.  The patient had an echocardiogram and it showed his
ejection fraction was 30 percent.  At this point his cardiac
medications included Coreg, Lipitor, Lisinopril, Nimodipine,
Lopressor, Hydralazine, Lisinopril and Carvedilol.  He was on
a Nipride drip.  During the evening of [**6-25**] Mr. [**Known lastname 93727**]
became more tachypneic and was reintubated at that time.  His
failure was unable to be controlled with Lasix and his CO2
was becoming very low and he ended up being reintubated
without any problems.  A head CT on [**2165-6-26**] showed stable
appearance of his brain since his previous study.  His
examination on [**6-26**] his left pupil was 2.5 to 2.  His right
pupil was the same.  His ICTs were 8 to 11. He was wiggling
his toes, would stick out his tongue, grasps were 4 to 6.
His sodium was up from 145 to 148, which was felt to be due
to his strict fluid balance.  His cultures from [**6-25**] showed a
sputum with gram positive cocci in pairs.  The only
antibiotics he had been on at that point were Kefzol for his
drain prophylaxis.

On [**6-27**] Mr. [**Known lastname 93727**] went back to the diagnostic angio suite and
had a diagnostic cerebral angiogram, which showed no evidence
of aneurysm, that his stent was patent and his coils were
intact.  On [**6-27**] Levaquin was started due to continued fevers
that Mr. [**Known lastname 93727**] has had since [**6-25**]. On [**6-27**] he was started and
Levaquin due to gram positive cocci in his sputum.  On [**6-28**]
his blood cultures showed 1 out of 2 gram positive cocci.  He
continued to have a fever without definitive cause.  He had
bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds, which were negative.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral small effusion.  His antibiotics
were changed from Kefzol to Vancomycin to cover positive
blood culture that he had.  His Dilantin was changed to
Depakote also trying to see if the source of the fever could
be from Dilantin. He was started on Depakote 750 mg t.i.d.
