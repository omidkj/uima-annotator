Chief Complaint:
somnolence and hypoxemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 46325**] is a 52 year old man with a history of COPD not on
O2, HCV s/p OLT [**2158**], HIV (last CD4 482 [**2164-8-7**]), who presents
from OSH with RLL infiltrate after waking up this morning
somnolent and short of breath. He was recently on a motorcycle
trip to [**State 81361**] and returned home on the evening of [**9-12**].
He reported only occasional shortness of breath during his trip
while he was at high elevation. Otherwise, he felt well. His
wife notes that he had some night sweats overnight, but he had
no other complaints. When he awoke on the morning of [**9-13**], he
felt very weak and unsteady. He had trouble making it from the
bedroom to the bathroom because felt he was moving very slowly
and was weak. He soiled himself, returned to the bed, and called
his wife. [**Name (NI) **] has no recollection of today's events until he
arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

According to his wife, he called her and was only able to say
"Help, help," before running out of breath. She found him taking
rapid shallow breaths and he appeared to be working to breathe.
He was taken to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital, where he was found to have an
O2 sat in the 70s. Labs were notable for a WBC of 11.2 and a K
of 6.5. A CXR showed a RLL infiltrate. He was placed on BiPAP
and given cefepime and solumedrol 125mg. He was given calcium,
insulin, and glucose for his hyperkalemia and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, initial VS were:  88 122/66 98%/biPAP
A CXR confirmed the RLL infiltrate. He was given duonebs,
azithromycin, and solumedrol 125mg. He was weaned to nasal
canula at 3L, and had an O2 sat of 93.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 98.7  65  150/84  16
83%/5L. His oxygen was uptitrated to 7L and his saturation
increased to 93%.

[**9-13**] CXR
FINDINGS:

The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and
hilar contours are
unremarkable.  There are low lung volumes.  New consolidative
opacity in the
right lung base is concerning for pneumonia.  There additionally
is a small
pleural effusion which is new.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
engorged.  No
pneumothorax is identified.  The left lung is grossly clear.  No
acute osseous
abnormalities are present.

IMPRESSION:

Findings concerning for right basilar pneumonia with small
pleural effusion.
Follow up radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure
resolution of
this finding.

[**9-14**] CXR
Large right pleural effusion is unchanged allowing the
difference in
positioning of the patient.  There is increasing right middle
lobe and right
lower lobe atelectasis.  Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is
obscured by the
pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.  There is no pneumothorax.
Left lower lobe
atelectasis has increased.

IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion associated with adjacent
opacities; these
opacities could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.  There is
worsening of the
loss of volume in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe.

[**9-16**] CXR
Atelectasis of the left base is again noted, slightly worse than
on the prior
chest x-ray.  A right pleural effusion is present and
atelectasis and/or
pneumonia in the right lower lobe may be present.  There has
been little
significant change in this region since the prior chest x-ray.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE

CAP: Patient had RLL infiltrate consistent with PNA. Sputum
cultures were sent, which were unrevealing. Hence, antibiotic
regimen was chosen as vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin (x5
days). Azithromycin course was completed. Vancomycin was stopped
on hospital day 3 given low suspicion for needing drug resistant
coverage he was transitioned to ceftriaxone and completed his
course during hospitalization. He was seen by ID at the request
of the transplant service.

COPD: started on methylpred, which was then transitioned to
prednisone. The patient improved with nebs and steroids was
weaned off of supplimental O2, with sats ~90-93%.

# Hyperkalemia: Likely related to acute on chronic renal failure
with hypovolemia component. In addition, was thought to
complicated by cyclosporine, where hyperkalemia is a known
complication.  Patient was treated with calcium/insulin/glucose
at OSH and was improving.  But, patient with high potassium even
after several liters of diuresis, raising potential that
cyclosporine was contributing.  Hepatology/nephrology was
consulted. His cyclosporin levels were at goal and his
hyperkalemia resolved without further intervention.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Thought to be due to
hypovolemia in setting of infection. Patient improved
substantially after fluid resuscitation.

# Acidemia: Pt has respiratory acidosis likely from chronic CO2
retention related to COPD and a concomitant non-gap metabolic
acidosis from acute on chronic renal failure. Patient was
trialed in night-time BiPap, which resulted in hypoxia. He would
benefit from an outpatient sleep study when back to baseline
respiratory status.
