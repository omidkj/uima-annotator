Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with Drug eluting stent placed in the
proximal Left anterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
63 y/oF with PMH of HTN, type 2 DM p/w chest discomfort that
started yesterday. Complained of acute onset sharp chest
discomfort, rated [**5-15**] which resolved with rest, and was
accompanied by severe dyspnea. No associated nausea/ vomiting or
diaphoresis. Did have an assoicated dry cough, felt faint, and
had some palpitations with the pain. Dyspnea persisted
throughout the night, preventing the patient from sleeping. As
symptoms persisted, patient called EMS. She has never had these
sx before or any prior heart issues. Denies edema.
.
EKG performed by EMS showed STE in V1-V4 and avR, and STD in
V5-V6, I, avL leads and qwave in III, and avF upon arrival in
the ED, code STEMI was activated. Initial VS: 94 146/80 16 and
96% on NRB. Received ASA 325, plavix 600mg and heparin gtt.
Chest pain resolved with SLN x 2 and initiation of nitro gtt.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary congestion.
Repeat EKG showed persistent EKG changes. Bedside echocardiogram
performed by cards and ED attending showed possible septal wall
hypokinesis. Initial labs remarkable for trop of 0.63 and
lactate of 3.3. Pt was given 500mg IVF bolus. Levaquin 750mg IV
was also given.
.
In the cath lab pt was found to have 90% LAD at S1 and had a DES
placed. Lcx was a small vessel with diffuse mod disease. RCA
proximally occluded with LAD collaterals. Pt had continued
hypoxia during the procedure requiring a NRB and was given lasix
80mg IV. EDP was elevated. No right heart cath was done.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, joint pains, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. No HA, vision changes,
or rashes.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, prior orthopnea to yesterday, ankle edema, or
syncope.

Imaging:
Echocardiogram [**2139-2-13**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and
akinesis of the basal inferior wall (most c/w prior
RCA-territory infarct) and edematous/akinetic anterior wall,
septum and apex (c/w recent LAD-territory infarct). The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Left pleural
effusion.
.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2139-2-13**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrates two vessel coronary artery disease. The LAD
contained a 90% lesion at the first septal. The circumflex
artery contained diffuse moderate disease that was not flow
limiting. The right coronary artery was chronically occluded
proximally and supplied by collaterals from the left anterior
descending.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrate systemic
normotension and marked elevation of the LVEDP to 33mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. NSTEMI due to ulcerated plaque of the proximal LAD.
.
PCXR ([**2139-2-13**]): REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Shortness of breath.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study
obtained the same day earlier.

The study demonstrates gradual progression of pulmonary edema
currently being moderate to severe. The edema is also
accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions, at least moderate in
size. There is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 89932**] is a 63 year-old woman with diabetes who presented
with chest pain and EKG changes consistent with ACS/NSTEMI.
.
# CORONARIES: She had ACS/NSTEMI changes on EKG and found to
have 90% LAD obstruction now for which she received PCI with
DES. She was also found to have moderate diffuse LCx disease and
proximally occluded RCA with LAD collaterals. She remained CP
free post procedure and remained hypodynamically stable
throughout her admission. She was started on aspirin, Plavix,
atorvastatin and metoprolol. She was continued on her home dose
of lisinopril.
.
# PUMP: Following her percutaneous intervention, she was found
to be in acute heart failure with evidence of CHF on CXR and
with an elevated LVEDP subsequently becoming acutely hypoxic
requring a NRB. Her BNP was 7604. Her EF was 30%. It was
believed that this was likely this is secondary to acute MI. She
was diuresed in the CCU with IV lasix and her breathing improved
significantly although she received extra dose of lasix on PM of
[**2-13**] due to sudden worsening of CHF symptoms. She quickly
improved with IV lasix and was stablized within 30min and did
well the next day. She was subsequently transfered to the
general medicine floor and maintained on a stable dose of lasix
and was also started on spironolactone. She was also started on
warfarin for LV akinesis and lwo EF to prevent clot formation.
Although she was did not have therapeutic INR at time of
discharge it should rise over the coming days and the risk of
ventricular clot is not high enough in this setting to demand
enoxaparin bridging at home. She should have a repeat echo in 6
weeks to evaluate for improvement of hypokinesis and ejection
fraction.
.
# RHYTHM: She remained in sinus rhythm throughout her
hospitalization
.
# DMII: Her glucose control remained stable on humalog sliding
scale with FSBG in the low 100s.
.
# HTN: Her blood pressure remained stable and she was continued
on her home dose of lisinopril and was started on metoprolol in
place of amlodipine
