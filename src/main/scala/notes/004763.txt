History of Present Illness:
64-year-old male with PMHx of CAD s/p DES to prox LAD in [**1-23**] &
[**7-23**], HTN, HLD & paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p PVI [**3-22**] who
presents with acute CHF exacerbation secondary to excessive
fluid resuscitation during PVI today. Patient received 3.3L of
fluid during procedure and urine output was only 300ml. He
received lasix IV 40mg x 2 with minimal effect. Given patient's
borderline hypotension, he was transferred to the CCU for
diuresis and close monitoring.

Patient complains of worsening DOE & orthopnea (two pillows at
baseline; now sleeping basically upright) over the past 2 days
prior to admission. Of note, he reports that he was instructed
to stop taking his metolazone 2-3 weeks ago for poor renal
function, but continued taking furosemide 80mg [**Hospital1 **]. Denies any
recent dietary indiscretion and states that he has been
compliant with his medications.
.
On review of systems,
(+): Per HPI, intermittent lightheadedness, completed a course
of antibiotics for pneumonia about 3 weeks prior to admission

(-): He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.
.
In the PACU, initial VS were BP 96/59, HR 72, 93% on shovel
mask. Patient was still mildly sedated, but able to carry on a
conversation

Imaging:
ECHO [**2134-3-24**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20 %) with relative preservation of the basal
inferolateral wall. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Moderate
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

CHEST XRAY PA/L
[**2134-3-27**]
Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged since [**2134-3-27**]. There is no
evidence of pleural effusion. Bilateral apical pleural
thickening is mild.


Brief Hospital Course:
64-year-old male with PMHx of CAD s/p DES to prox LAD in [**1-23**] &
[**7-23**], HTN, HLD & paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p PVI [**3-22**] who
presents with acute CHF exacerbation secondary to excessive
fluid resuscitation and ineffective diuresis during PVI today.
.
# PUMP/Acute decompensated CHF: LVEF decreased significantly
from 55-60% ([**October 2133**]) to 29% ([**January 2134**]). No evidence of ischemia on
EKG and patient denies any chest pain. Worsening of LV function
likely secondary to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in the
context of persistent atrial fibrillation. Current CHF
exacerbation most likely triggered by fluid overload from IVF
during pulmonary vein isolation in the context of already
worsening CHF since prior to admission (after stopping
metolazone for 2 weeks). Last CHF exacerbation was [**1-29**]. Patient
denies any dietary indiscretion or medication non-compliance. He
was diuresed with furosemide gtt and metolazone which was
eventually switched to PO torsemide. His creatinine continued to
trend down in this setting.  He was discharged on 40 mg
torsemide daily.
.
# CORONARIES/CAD: Patient has had [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to proximal LAD, in
[**January 2128**] and [**July 2128**]. He denies any recent chest pain or ACS. No
changes on EKG suggestive of ischemia. Continue aspirin 81mg,
simvastatin 20mg. Started on spironolactone. His metoprolol was
res
