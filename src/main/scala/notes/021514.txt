Service:  [**Hospital1 **] MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 83-year-old female, with
multiple medical problems including diabetes, hypertension,
heart failure, COPD, and a history of CVAs, who has been
experiencing dysphagia over the past year.  She presented to
[**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital initially, after she began choking on
a dinner of Chinese food.  A day prior, she had had
hematemesis, as well as some chest pain.  She was seen for an
initial evaluation at [**Location (un) **] where she was taken to the
endoscopy suite.  An EGD revealed a 10 cm esophageal [**Location (un) 1994**]
with bleeding consistent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1994**], and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation for concerns of
esophageal perforation.

On arrival, a gastrografin bowel study was obtained that was
negative for perforation.  Chest x-ray was negative, as well.
The the gastroenterology service was consulted.  Her initial
management was supportive with blood transfusions, and
empiric antibiotics.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction
via serial enzymes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  An elderly female presenting with acute
esophageal mucosal [**Last Name (LF) 1994**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] variant, explaining
her presenting bleeding.  Likely, she has other esophageal
pathology such as peptic strictures from longstanding
gastroesophageal reflux disease.  In her initial course, she
was treated supportively with blood transfusion to keep the
hematocrit greater than 30%, given her underlying coronary
artery disease.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction via
serial enzymes.  She was treated with empiric antibiotics
including ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Following
blood product support, she remained hemodynamically stable
without further evidence of bleed.

Given her hemodynamic stability, the consultation with the
gastroenterology service, a repeat EGD was felt not to be of
utility on this admission, due to the inability to dilate in
the setting of this [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1994**].  Rather, a diagnostic
EGD after four to six weeks of esophageal rest, with proton
pump inhibitor prophylaxis, will allow for better
visualization, and perhaps tissue diagnosis.  While this is
likely a stricture, other processes cannot be ruled out, such
as masses or carcinoma.

Her hospital course was also notable for two days of
delirium.  This was in the setting of ativan.  Her mental
status cleared with discontinuation of the benzodiazepine.
She had no further issues in this regard subsequently.

With respect to her hypertension, her antihypertensives were
reinitiated upon achievement of hemodynamic stability.  Her
blood pressure was well-controlled subsequently.

With respect to her diabetes, she is on a reduced dose of
insulin, as her PO tolerance steadily increases.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1994**].  2)
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  3) Diabetes mellitus, type
2.  4) Coronary artery disease.  5) Congestive heart failure.
6) Hypertension.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  1) The patient will be discharged to
extended care facility.  2) Her diet should consist of soft
consistency foods/diabetic foods for the next 6 weeks.  3)
She needs to be kept on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], for
example Protonix 40 mg po bid.  4) Her hematocrit should be
monitored on a qod basis to insure hemodynamic stability.  5)
Her fingersticks should be monitored qid.  6) The patient is
currently on 10 U of NPH in the am and 15 U of NPH in the pm.
As her PO tolerance increases, can titrate up to a home dose
of Insulin:  25 U NPH, 5 U regular in am; 35 U NPH, 5 U
regular in pm.  7) Refrain from giving patient nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatories or COXII inhibitors.  Also, hold Plavix
and aspirin for now.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27082**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 29810**] who is the patient's primary care
physician and cardiologist.  The patient will need a repeat
EGD in 6 weeks.  She may follow-up at [**Hospital1 18**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**]
[**Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Given the fact that she lives
quite a distance from [**Hospital1 18**], she can follow-up this EGD
closer to home if she prefers.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Hemodynamically stable.  Tolerating
soft foods without dysphagia.  Alert and oriented x 3.
