Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transferred with ETT and L IJ CVL ([**3-27**]).
Bronchosopy ([**3-27**]) with BAL.
Esophageal balloon study ([**3-29**]).
Terminal extubation ([**3-31**]).

History of Present Illness:
22 yo woman with history of Rubinstein Taybi disease (with
associated kyphoscoliosis, small lung volumes and chronic right
lung compression, obesity, mental retardation, and short
stature) who presents from OSH with CC of respiratory distress.
History was obtained from her mother.

Pt was reportedly in her USOH until morning of transfer, when
she developed acute onset shortness of breath. Per her mother
she was being treated with prolonged prednisone taper after URI
approx one month ago. She received about one week of antibiotics
(cipro + cephalosporin) and was treated with prolonged
prednisone taper, down to 5 mg on the day prior to admission.
She was in her USOH until this morning, when she became acutely
hypoxic to 50s. Her mother thumped on her chest a few times
after which she coughed up a large mucus plug. However, she
continued to have increasing oxygen requirements which prompted
her mother to bring her to [**Name (NI) 1562**] Hospital ED.

At OSH ED, she was noted to have initial BP 146/93, HR 118, RR
32, with sats 88-91% on NRB 15L. EKG showed sinus tachycardia
with RAD and RBBB. Cardiac enzymes were negative. White count
was noted to be 24K. CXR showed complete white-out both lung
fields although this was difficult to interpret in the setting
of severe kyphoscoliosis. Patient was intubated for hypoxemic
respiratory failure. Left IJ placed. She underwent bronchoscopy
that showed moderate thick yellowish mucus plug in the RLL with
clot. There were no visible neoplasms. Patient was given
Rocephin, vancomycin, and azithromycin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further care.

At time of transfer patient was hypoxic to 60s on 100% FiO2. HR
was 130s and regular with stable blood pressure. ABGs were
consistent with respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia. Patient
underwent bronchoscopy that showed scant secretions, most
prominent in the left lingula. Secretions were suctioned and
washed without incident. BAL was then performed after which
there was frank bleeding, after which small amount of iced
saline was applied with resulting cessation of bleeding. After
the bronch her vent settings were adjusted to pressure control,
30/15, FiO2 100% and RR 28 with resulting increase in O2 sat to
90%.

**Of note pt is on chronic oxygen therapy at home with CPAP at
night. Per report she uses 2-4L oxygen by NC to maintain sats in
the low 90s. She is ambulatory at baseline.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: unable to attain.


Past Medical History:
#Rubinstein Taybe disease, complicated by mental retardation,
short stature, severe kyphoscoliosis, restrictive and
obstructive lung physiology
#tachycardia thought to be related to underlying lung disease

Social History:
patient lives with mother and father on [**Hospital3 **]. Per report she
is ambulatory at baseline and attends school. Of note, pt with
multiple sick contacts recently (including visiting nurses and
multiple family members).


Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
BP 96/59, HR 118, sat 91%, RR 28
Ventilation: pressure control 30/15, FiO2 100%, RR 28
General: intubated and sedated
HEENT: small indurated, raised eythematous lesion on left jaw
(per mother this lesion is not new)
Neck: supple
Heart: RRR, normal s1/s2, tachycardic
Lungs: coarse breath sounds bilaterally
Abdomen: obese, soft, non-tender
Extremities: warm, well-perfused, non-edematous

Studies/Images:

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**3-28**]):
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Dilated right ventricle
with evidence of right ventricular pressure and volume over
load. If clinically indicated, a cardiac MR ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5098**]) is
recommended to further assess biventricular structure and
function.

Lower extremity doppler ultrasound ([**3-27**]):
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT. Limited study
due to
patient's body habitus.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and hemoptysis.
Differential includes infectious etiologies (viral, bacterial,
fungal), autoimmune/inflammatory disorders (Goodpasture's,
Wegeners)- resulting in ARDS or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. INR
slightly elevated at 1.2 with platelets of 134 (no baseline
available). Patient with no h/o exposure to antiplatelet agents
or anticoagulants. She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL fluid was
sent for microbial analysis. She was treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloacin, cefepime) for pneumonia,
given her tenuous status. She was also started on high dose
steroids because she had just completed a prolonged steroid
taper and there was concern of airway inflammation/obstructive
lung disease. In addition, because she was so difficult to
oxygenate, she underwent esophageal balloon study to help assess
and adjust her ventilator settings. With increasing the PEEP and
driving pressure, her oxygenation improved significantly and we
were able to wean down on the FiO2. Clinically, she appeared
stable to slightly improved, though still ventilated with high
peak expiratory and inspiratory pressures. Due to her recurrent
admissions, high liklihood of prolonged ventilator-dependence,
and overall poor prognosis, her family decided (over the course
of several days) to withdraw care. She was extubated on [**3-31**]
and passed away shortly thereafter

# Tachycardia. Patient has chronic tachycardia which is felt to
be related to chronic hypoxemia from underlying lung disease.
Other considerations include intravascular volume depletion,
anemia from blood loss, and pulmonary embolism. Her hct dropped
slightly from 37 at admission to 33, although after discussion
with her family it seemed this was consistent with her baseline.
She underwent lower extremity doppler that showed no evidence of
DVT. She also underwent transthoracic echocardiogram that showed
right ventricular dilation and mild pulmonary hypertension,
although both were unchanged from a study one year prior (making
acute PE less likely). When her oxygenation improved (see
above), the tachycardia likewise improved. Thus the tachycardia
was likely a compensatory response to the hypoxemia.

# Leukocytosis. We suspect this is
