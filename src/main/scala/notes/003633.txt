Colonoscopy:
Ulcer in the cecum at the site of previous polypectomy - three
endosocpic clips were applied for hemostasis. Blood in the whole
colon


Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo M who presents with BRBPR after colonoscopy with
polypectomy.

GI Bleed / Acute blood loss anemia.
He was initially admitted to the MICU. He was transfused four
units of pRBCs with stabilization of his hematocrit.  GI was
consulted and performed colonoscopy on admission to the ICU; a
large ulcer was found at site of polypectomy with bright red
blood throughout the colon; the ulcer was clipped and hemostasis
was attained.
He had a fever and leukocytosis and this was likely in the
setting of stress but he was placed on emipiric antibiotics x 48
hours to cover GI organisms (amp, cipro, flagyl). These were
quickly peeled off as he defervesed. He was transferred to the
general medical [**Hospital1 **] on hospital day 3 where he remained stable
and his leukocytosis resolved.

HTN, benign: His lisinopril was resumed prior to discharge.

Asthma, without exacerbation: His advair was continued.

Mental Status:Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted because you were bleeding from your rectum.
You had another colonoscopy and you had an ulcer where the polyp
was removed. This was clipped by the endoscopist. You required
blood transfusion due to the bleeding (4 units of red cells);
following the transfusion your counts remained stable.

Do not take any advil, aleve, aspirin or other NSAIDs for 72
hours. You may take Tylenol if needed.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up with your PCP this week.  You need to have repeat
blood work at this visit.

Due to the large size of the polyp, you should have a repeat
colonoscopy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 6 months to make sure that there
is no residual polyp at the site where this large polyp was
removed.  Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2306**] to schedule your repeat
colonoscopy with anesthesia.
