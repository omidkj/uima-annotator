CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ct removal

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old man with MVP/MR s/p MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
ct removal
PORTABLE CHEST, DATED [**2164-2-5**]

COMPARISON: [**2-3**].

INDICATION: Chest tube removal.

The patient is status post mitral valve replacement. There has
been interval removal of various lines and tubes including a
left-sided chest tube, with no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac
and mediastinal contours are stable. There is persistent
increased opacity in left retrocardiac region as well as a left
pleural effusion. There is an apparently new right pleural
effusion, partially layering on this semi-upright study.

PROCEDURE DATE: [**2164-1-4**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
CAD, AI, MR, TR
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with patent stents in
LAD and
LCX
2. Moderate-Severe MR
3. Moderate AI
4. Elevation of left sided filling pressures
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this co dominant
patient revealed patent stents. The LMCA had a 20% origin
occlusion.
The LAD and LCX had patent stents and provided left to right
collaterals. The RCA was a small vessel and was occluded after
mid
segment.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevation of left sided filling
pressures with PCWP and LVEDP of 25-28mmHG. There were [**Doctor Last Name **] v
waves
on the wedge tracing to 45mmHG consistent with severe MR. There
was
moderate pulmonary hypertension with mean PA pressure of 38mmHG.
Cardiac output was not formally calculated but mean PA sat was
66%
3. LV gram revealed global hypokinesis with EF 25-30% and 3plus
MR.
4. Aortogram revealed 2plus AI

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Mildly depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function
likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic function.


AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: No AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate/severe MVP. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR. Severe PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Thickened pulmonic valve
leaflets. Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include thinned and akinetic
inferior segments and hypokinetic inferolateral segments. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 83WM was admitted on [**2164-2-3**] and underwent MVR with #29
Perimount Thermafix pericardial valve.  He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition on Milrinone, Epinephrine, and Neo.  The cross clamp
time was 39 minutes and total bypass time was 57 minutes.  His
drips were weaned overnight and he was extubated on POD#1.  He
was transferred to the floor on POD#2 and continued to pro
