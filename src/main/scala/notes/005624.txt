Brief Hospital Course:
admitted on [**8-25**] after stopping coumadin on [**8-20**]. Had cath done
in preparation for Redo [**Month/Year (2) 1291**] which was performed when INR
normalized with heparin coverage. On [**8-28**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed
redosternotomy with aortic valve repair. Transferred to CSRU in
stable condition on a propofol drip.extubated later that day. on
POD #1, pacing wires were DCed after EP service reprogrammed DD
rate to 70. Cts were also removed. He was alert and oriented
with 2+ periph. edema, AV paced, and transferred to the floor.
Diuresis was begun on POD #2 and coumadin restarted later that
evening. Beta blockade started with metoprolol. Started working
with PT to increase his activity level. He did extremely well
and did a level 5 on POD #2. He continued to be monitored for a
therapeutic rise in INR for coumadin dosing. ON POD #3, it
remained at 1.1 and heparin drip was started on [**9-1**]. EP
