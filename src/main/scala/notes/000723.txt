Chief Complaint:
unresponsive episodes

None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 76yo W with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, squamous cell carcinoma (s/p
radiation and chemotherapy), chronic trach/[**First Name3 (LF) 282**] dependent who
developed acute unresponsiveness on [**2166-9-21**]. She was
recently discharged from the [**Last Name (un) 1724**] ICU approximately one week or
so ago where she was hospitalized for pneumonia/pneumonitis.
During this hospitalization, she was trach'd/[**Last Name (un) 282**]'d and
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for vent weaning. The
patient happened to be seen at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] on the afternoon of
[**2166-9-21**] by the on call neurologist. These are his first
impressions:

"This morning in rehab she had been fine, alert and
communicating with her husband through lip [**Location (un) 1131**] and writing.
Suddenly at 11:45 a.m. her head slumped to one side and eyes
rolled upward. She arrived in the emergency room at 12:06.  On
arrival, she was unresponsive.  A stroke burst page was
activated.  Noncontrast head CT was negative.  CT angiogram was
negative.  Because of multiple risks (recent tracheostomy, chest
tube and [**Location (un) 282**] placement, INR 3 yesterday, and NIH stroke score of
greater than 25), she was not felt to be a tPA candidate.  I
examined her immediately after the head CT, prior to MRI.  At
that time, she had no response to voice or sternal rub.  There
was no withdrawal of the limbs to nailbed pressure, although if
a limb was raised passively, she could hold it in place.  There
was no clear asymmetry of strength.  There was no meningismus.
The right pupil was 7 mm, left 5 mm, both sluggishly reactive.
Corneal reflexes were present bilaterally.  Oculocephalic
responses were absent, although there were occasional
spontaneous eye movements to both the right and left. There were
some weak blinking movements of the eyelids, but no other
spontaneous motor activity.  The exam raised a concern for
nonconvulsive seizure.  She was given lorazepam 1 mg IV prior to
the MRI.  MRI of the brain showed no acute infarction or other
obvious structural lesion.  On arrival in the emergency room,
again she was given another milligram of lorazepam IV and I
recommended a loading dose of IV phenytoin."

Following her load of phenytoin, the patient did not receive her
complete 1gm dose of IV phenytoin because after the first 500mg,
she became hypotensive to the 70/43. Dilantin was stopped. This
also occurred in the setting of having received ativan as noted
above. She was aggressively fluid resuscitated and transferred
to the intensive care unit. At that time, the neurologist once
again had the pleasure of examining the patient. These were his
impressions at the time:

"When I reexamined her at 2:15 p.m., she could open eyes
spontaneously and look to voice.  She followed a few simple
commands including closing the mouth,  opening the eyes and
sticking out the tongue.  She made weak attempts to grip with
both the right and left hands.  She appropriately shook her head
no when asked if her name was [**Doctor First Name **] but weakly nodded to [**Known firstname **].
 She could bend her knees to command.  Pupils were 6 mm on the
right, 5 mm on the left, each constricting by 1 mm with light.
Eye movements were full.  Corneal reflexes were symmetric.  More
detailed sensory testing was not possible.  There was no clear
facial weakness.  The tongue was midline.  Strength appeared
symmetric without clear weakness.  Reflexes were 2+ and
symmetric in the biceps,
brachioradialis and patellar tendons, 1+ at the Achilles
tendons.  Plantar stimulation produced withdrawal bilaterally.
Sensory exam was limited in the limbs, although she appeared to
feel nailbed pressure in all 4 limbs."

Later that day, [**Known firstname **] became more alert, in the setting of
initiating dilantin TID dosing. Overnight, she did well. This
morning, the patient was noted to be more drowsy and
unresponsive. The precise story is unclear. The patient's family
today report that she was more "anxious" but that in fact she
did become more "unresponsive". She also did complain of some
chest/stomach discomfort that was initially thought to be
cardiac in nature. She received some nitroglycerin which dropped
her blood pressures, and ultimately required more fluid boluses.
Her EKG and cardiac enzymes were normal. Later, they thought
that perhaps it might have been related to problems with [**Name2 (NI) 282**]
tube feeds. Her [**Name2 (NI) 282**] feeds were stopped and she received a CT
scan of her abdomen/pelvis which only showed evidence of
pancreatic ductal dilatation without free fluid or
intraperitoneal air. Her "responsiveness" also subsequently
improved throughout the course of this day. Since this OSH was
not able to check an EEG, she was ultimately transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for EEG monitoring and further work up for possible NCSE.

Review of Systems: As mentioned above in the HPI. The patient's
family reports that she has had some tremors in the past week
which they recognize as possibly related to seizures (?). These
were mainly of her lower extremities. Otherwise, they deny any
fevers, dysuria, pain complaints, difficulties with diplopia,
dizziness.


Past Medical History:
1.  Squamous cell lung carcinoma diagnosed in [**Month (only) 116**].  Status post
chemotherapy and radiation, reportedly completed in [**Month (only) 205**]. Course
complicated by radiation pneumonitis which has required multiple
steroid tapers.
2.  COPD, on home oxygen for 2 years.
3.  Atrial fibrillation, on anticoagulation with Coumadin. Also
on amiodarone/diltiazem for rate control
4.  Recent pneumonia and pneumothorax, with a most recent
admission to [**Hospital3 **] from [**8-30**] to [**9-12**].
During that admission, she had placement of a chest tube,
tracheostomy on [**9-9**] and [**Month (only) 282**] tube placement [**9-10**].
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Anemia of chronic disease.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Herpes zoster, reportedly involving the right eye and face
early this year.


Social History:
Strong family support system, married. Never smoker, non
alcoholic


Family History:
Positive for "grand mal" seizures in her grandson
