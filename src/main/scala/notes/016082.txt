upper endoscopy x2


History of Present Illness:
68 M with history of GI bleeds, Barrett's esophagus, ?Dieulafoy
lesion, HTN, HL, sCHF (EF 35%), DMII, CKD (baseline 2.0), AV
block [**2-16**] Lyme disease, presents with nausea, vomiting,
hematemesis, and dark brown stools.  He had a recent admission
for dyspnea during which he was found to have UGIB, had EGD
performed three times on the last admission, showed Barrett's
esophagus and was concerning for possible Dieulafoy lesion, had
2 endoclips placed.  Was discharged last admission with a
hematocrit that was stable at 29-30.
.
The morning of presentation to ED, he experienced nausea and
vomiting at 2 AM.  Noted that there was coffee grounds in his
vomit and that his stools were dark brown in color.  Has been
having diarrhea since this morning as well.  He became concerned
that he may have another GI bleed and so came in to be further
evaluated.  Denies recent ASA or NSAID use.  Complains of some
dyspnea on exertion, but notes that this is unchanged from his
baseline.  Feeling slightly dizzy today.

In the ED inital vitals were, 97.1 81 118/69 18 100% RA.  He was
found to have dark brown guaiac positive stool.  NG lavage was
positive, unable to be cleared even after 500 cc of lavage.  He
received 1 L of NS and 1 unit of pRBC.  Ondansetron and
metoclopramide were given for management of nausea.  Patient
bolused pantoprazole 80 mg IV x1 and started on drip at 8 mg/hr.
 GI evaluated patient while in the ED, is planning on performing
EGD today.  Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient's last set of
vitals were: 117/49, 73, 18, high 90s RA
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient reports feeling well.  Not
currently nauseous, understands that he needs another EGD today.

IMAGING:
EGD [**2124-12-28**]:
Esophagus:  A salmon colored mucosa distributed in a tongue
pattern, suggestive of Barrett's Esophagus was found.
Stomach: Clotted blood was seen in the stomach body and fundus.
The snare was used to break up and push down parts of the clot.
There was a large clot in the patient's stomach. Using the
snare, attempt was made to break it up and move it down, however
dispite this and extensive washing, there was remaining clot
obscuring complete visualization. There was no red blood or
active bleeding, nor was there a visible vessel or culprit
lesion in the portion of the stomach that was seen. There was no
oozing or stigmata of recent bleeding at the site of prior
clips.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
    Impression: Blood in the stomach body and fundus (foreign
body removal)
There was a large clot in the patient's stomach. Using the
snare, attempt was made to break it up and move it down, however
despite this and extensive washing, there was remaining clot
obscuring complete visualization. There was no red blood or
active bleeding, nor was there a visible vessel or culprit
lesion in the portion of the stomach that was seen. There was no
oozing or stigmata of recent bleeding at the site of prior
clips.
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
EGD [**2124-12-29**]:
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Site of prior clips was without stigmata of recent
bleeding. A red spot was seen adjascent to the site of prior
clips, which had the appearance of a possible vessel tip. There
was no active bleeding from this site.  4 1 cc.Epinephrine
1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were applied for hemostasis with success. A
gold probe was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa was noted in the duodenal bulb
compatible with duodenitis.
Impression: Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with
duodenitis
A red spot in the stomach (injection, thermal therapy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
This is a 68 M with history of GI bleeds, Barrett's esophagus,
?Dieulafoy lesion who presented with gastrointestinal bleed. He
had two upper endoscopies which demonstrated a red spot, treated
with thermal therapy and injected.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
#. Gastrointestinal bleed - Patient presented with coffee ground
emesis and dark stools with recent history of bleeding Dieulafoy
lesion which was clipped.  Suspicion was high for an upper GI
source given report of coffee grounds in vomit, positive NG
lavage, past EGD findings, and high BUN/creatinine ratio.  Upper
endoscopy was performed in the MICU which initially showed
coffee grounds a large clot but no evidence of active bleed. A
repeat endoscopy in HD 2 demonstrated erythema in the duodenal
bulb compatible with duodenitis. A red spot was visualized which
was injected and given thermal therapy. The EGD was otherwise
normal to the third part of duodenum.  He was continued on a PPI
drip for 72 hours. He was given erythromycin to help with GI
motility in passing clot.  He was transferred to the general
medical floor on HD 3. His hematocrit was stable with no
hemodynamic compromise. He was discharged on HD 4.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
#. HTN: Home antihypertensives were initially held in setting of
GI bleed but were resumed once his hematocrit stabilized.
.
#. chronic systolic CHF: Ejection fraction of 35% demonstrated
on TTE from [**2124-12-8**].  He appeared euvolemic on admission. His
beta blocker, ACEi, and diuretics were initially held in setting
of GI bleed but resumed prior to discharge.
.
#. Type 2 DM: Patient's diabetes is complicated by neuropathy
and diabetic nephropathy. He was continued on home Lantus and
Humalog sliding scale.
.
#. HL: He was continued on atorvastatin.
.
#. chronic kidney disease: Creatinine remained at baseline 2.0
during admission.
.
#. AV block: Thought to be secondary to Lyme disease.  He
completed a course of ceftriaxone on [**2124-1
