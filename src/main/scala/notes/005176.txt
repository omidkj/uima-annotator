Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from surgical ICU for cavitary pneumonia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
G-tube placement
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69575**] is a 66 year old man with a history of oxygen and
steroid dependent COPD, HTN, type II diabetes,

Pt has had multiple admissions for COPD exacerbations, most
recently presenting to an OSH mid-[**2185-6-18**] for this.  He was
found to have bilateral upper lobe infiltrates and
lymphadenopathy on a chest CT.  Sputum grew out Pseudomonas and
he was treated with cefepime and a steroid taper. A PICC was
placed and he was discharged home on to complete his treatment
regimen.  On [**2185-8-14**] he re-presented to [**Hospital1 1562**] with 3 days
of DOE, fevers, and sweats, with a cough productive of brown
sputum.  He quickly developed further respiratory distress and
required ICU transfer and intubation.  Bronchoscopy performed
[**8-15**] demonstrated food particles in his RUL.  BAL was negative
for AFB, culture grew out pseudomonas and another GNR.  PPD was
negative.  Pt received vancomycin and ticaracillin/clavulanate
x2 doses.

Past Medical History:
Type II Diabetes
O2-dependent COPD
H/O pancreatic pseudocyst
s/p CCY
Psoriasis
Alcohol abuse


Social History:
Pt was born in [**State 531**] City.  He lives alone, independent of
his ADLs at baseline.  He stopped smoking recently, but
continues to drink alcohol.  He has three grown children, per
OSH records he has been estranged from them.  His son [**Name (NI) **] ([**Name2 (NI) 1105**])
called in and reported he is HCP but also has health problems

Further labs,see below.
.
EKG: NSR with PAC. No ST/T changes.
.
CXR: ET tube is in good position.  NG tube projects beyond the
projection of the film.  There are bilateral upper lobe
consolidations with probable cavitation in the left upper lobe.
Lower lung fields are clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
pneumothorax.
.
OSH Chest CT [**2185-8-14**]: b/l infiltrates, large cavities in upper
lobes (increased in size compared to prev. studies).

.
[**8-17**] CXR: Bilateral upper lobe consolidation, likely infectious
etiology. Tuberculosis also remains in the differential.
Findings communicated with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69577**].
.
[**2185-8-19**]: Allowing for difference in technique, bilateral apical
opacities and upper lobe cavitation appear unchanged. No new
consolidations are evident. The heart size is normal. No
pulmonary vascular congestion or right pleural effusion. The
left lateral costophrenic sulci has been excluded. The ET tube
terminates 5.3 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses below
the diaphragm, however, the tip has been excluded. No
pneumothorax is evident.
.
[**2185-8-20**] CXR: The tip of the left IJ line lies in the midline
within the left innominate vein. The position of the other lines
and tubes is unchanged. No other alteration is seen. No
pneumothorax is present.
.
[**2185-8-21**] CXR: The right subclavian line has been withdrawn and now
lies in the mid SVC. The left IJ line has been removed. No
pneumothorax is seen. No other changes are noted.
.
[**2185-8-23**]: CXR: Biapical cavitary consolidation, slightly improved
compared to prior radiograph from [**2185-8-21**].
.
[**2185-8-24**] AXR: Tip of NG tube overlies duodenal bulb. Distribution
of bowel gas is unremarkable with gas present throughout the
colon and in the rectum and no free intraperitoneal gas. No soft
tissue masses or radiopaque calculi. IMPRESSION: No diagnostic
abnormality.
.
[**2185-8-25**] CXR: Biapical cavitary lesions are essentially unchanged,
however worsening right lower lobe consolidation.
.
[**2185-8-26**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Rightward axis - is nonspecific
and may be within normal limits. No previous tracing available
for comparison.
.
[**2185-8-27**] CXR: Interval increase in bilateral upper lobe opacities
as well as in the right lower lungs. Findings likely represent
worsening of infection.
.
[**2185-8-28**] CXR: The endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. Again
seen are bilateral right greater than left cavitary upper lobe
lesions. There is also hazy increased opacity in the right lower
lobe that could represent focal infiltrate in that region.
Overall, the appearance is similar to that seen on the film from
the prior day.
.
[**2185-8-29**] CXR: Mild increase in left upper lobe opacity. Otherwise
no significant interval change.
.
[**2185-8-29**] Echo: Preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

.
[**2185-8-30**] CXR: Large areas of cavitary destruction or pneumatocele
formation in the right upper lung, which have progressed since
[**8-17**] are now marginated by increasingly-severe
consolidation in the right upper lobe extending to the minor
fissure and worsening pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
Cavitary consolidation in the left upper lobe now contains more
fluid. Heart is normal size. Small right pleural effusion has
increased. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube
passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Right jugular line
ends in the SVC. Heart is normal size and midline.
.
ECG [**2185-8-30**]: Sinus tachycardia and frequent atrial ectopy. Low
precordial lead voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2185-8-26**] frequent atrial ectopy has appeared. Otherwise, no
diagnostic interim change.
.
CXR [**2185-9-1**]: AP single view is obtained with patient in upright
sitting position. Comparison is made with the next previous
similar study obtained three hours earlier during the same date.
In the interval, a NG Dobhoff tube has been placed, seen to
reach the antrum of the stomach. Otherwise, chest findings are
unchanged and no pneumothorax has developed.
.
CXR [**2185-9-2**]: Relatively stable radiograph with large right upper
lobe cavitary lesion persisting and subtle improved aeration of
surrounding consolidation. No air-fluid level evident on this
exam.
.
CT Head [**2185-9-3**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Please note
that MRI is more sensitive for detection of acute stroke.
.
CXR [**2185-9-5**]: Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position.
Right subclavian catheter has been removed, and a left PICC line
has been placed, terminating in the lower superiors vena cava.
Feeding tube continues to terminate below the diaphragm.
Multifocal areas of consolidation in the right lung as well as
in the left upper lobe show slight interval improvement,
particularly in the right mid and lower lung regions. Underlying
cystic spaces are present in both upper lobes and may be due to
pre-existing bullous emphysema, although a component of cavitary
p
