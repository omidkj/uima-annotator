Admission Date:  [**2116-11-25**]     Discharge Date:

Date of Birth:   [**2055-3-17**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU/SICU
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
61 year old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old
maintained on three liters nasal cannula at home, presenting
to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with crescendo
dyspnea.  She apparently had seven days of worsening
shortness of breath.

On Saturday, [**2116-11-21**], the patient's primary care
physician started her on levofloxacin for a chronic
admission, she reports that she could not walk across the
room.

On presentation to the Emergency Room, the patient's oxygen
saturation was 86% on three liters nasal cannula.  With
nebulizers, oxygen saturation dropped to 70 and the patient
was ultimately placed on a nonrebreather and continuous
nebulizers.  She also received intravenous levofloxacin and
Solu-Medrol.  Arterial blood gases at that point, after
starting the nonrebreather, were 7.33, 81 and 115.

The patient had never been intubated before.  Her last
hospitalization was earlier this year with a similar flare
but not as severe, no fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or
chills.  Ultimately, the patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for observation because of questionable
respiratory status and also because of continuous nebulizers.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  2.  Hypertension.  3.  Status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Maxzide 75/50, Prevacid 30 mg
p.o.q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.d., Cardizem 120 mg p.o.q.d.,
Trental 1,200 mg p.o.q.d., Xanax 0.25 mg p.o.q.d., Flonase,
Atrovent, Ventolin and Fosamax.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, codeine and shellfish.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**State **], in [**Hospital1 1559**].  She quit tobacco seven days
prior to presentation.  Her family lives in [**Location 86**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on
presentation, the patient had a temperature of 99.3, heart
rate 110, blood pressure 203/110, respiratory rate 40 and
oxygen saturation 90% on 100% nonrebreather.  General:
Significant respiratory distress and shortness of breath.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements
intact, dry mucous membranes.  Neck:  No jugular venous
distention, no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Decreased breath
sounds throughout, no wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Sinus
tachycardia, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
No edema, clubbing present.  Neurologic examination:  Cranial
nerves II through XII intact, [**3-28**] motor strength, gait not
observed at time of admission.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 13.8,
hematocrit 42.1, platelet count 313,000, INR 1, prothrombin
time 12, partial thromboplastin time 25.2, sodium 133,
potassium 4, chloride 85, bicarbonate 35, BUN 10, creatinine
0.4, glucose 125, CK 54, calcium 10.2, phosphorous 4.6 and
magnesium 1.7.  Arterial blood gases:  7.33, 81, 159 on 100%
nonrebreather.  Chest x-ray:  Clear, hyperinflated lungs, no
effusions or pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was ultimately admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit.  She was on continuous nebulizers
initially and continued on her steroids and antibiotics.  Her
chest x-ray was without a clear infiltrate.  She continued to
be hypertensive.

Ultimately, because the patient began to retain more carbon
dioxide, with a pCO2 of 100, pH of 7.21 and pO2 241, and
because of worsening dyspnea, the patient was actually
intubated on [**2116-11-25**].  On [**2116-11-26**], the
patient was felt to be improving from a respiratory
perspective on her levofloxacin.  She was switched over to
pressor support.

The patient managed to wean down off pressor support rapidly.
The decision was made to extubate the patient after she was
on 5 and 5 for an extended period of time.  The patient was
extubated on [**2116-11-26**] and, for one and one-half hours,
was able to breathe free but, after that, had to be
reintubated.  After getting sedation, she became hypotensive.
A right internal jugular line was placed.

The hypotension was likely due to sedation, so the patient
was started on transiently on Dopamine, which made her
tachycardiac, and then switched over to Levophed.
Ultimately, the pressor was discontinued overnight after some
fluid boluses.

The patient continued to be intubated, with differing levels
of anxiety, making her breathing more difficult.  She slowly
crept up in terms of her pressure support and it became
obvious that the patient would not tolerate extubation.

Ultimately, on [**2116-12-1**], the patient had a
tracheostomy placed, which she tolerated well, and was
initially screened by several rehabilitation facilities for
discharge for weaning.

PROBLEM LIST:
1.  Pulmonary/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare:
Steroids are currently at Prednisone 30 mg.  At the time of
dictation, [**2116-12-1**], she is on day one of her 30 mg of
Prednisone.  We will decrease by 10 mg every three days.  The
patient's baseline steroid level at home, reportedly by her
daughter, is 5 mg.  She is steroid dependent, which is an
issue that was not brought up on her admission.   Antibiotics
are to continue until [**2116-12-2**], for a total of seven
days.  There was no clear infiltrate and her sputum has
negative to date.  She should continue her Combivent and her
theophylline.  A level has not been checked of the
theophylline and should be done at the time of discharge.

2.  Cardiovascular/hypertension:  The patient is on
hydrochlorothiazide and diltiazem, now with good blood
pressure control.  Would consider an ACE inhibitor if ongoing
issues of hypertension.

3.  Sedation:  The patient is currently managed on Haldol and
Ativan.  Ativan works better for the patient as a PRN than
Haldol.  Would continue basal levels of both and PRN.

4.  Prophylaxis:  The patient is on subcutaneous heparin and
on tube feeds.  The plan is to place a Dobbhoff under
fluoroscopy prior to discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Heparin 5,000 units b.i.d.
Combivent six puffs q.4h.
Diltiazem 60 mg q.i.d.
ProMod with fiber goal of 45 cc.
Lactulose 30 cc q.8h.
Reglan 10 mg i.v.t.i.d.
Haldol 1 mg t.i.d.
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg q.d.
Prednisone 30 mg q.d. for a goal of weaning patient back to
her baseline level of 5 mg within two weeks.
Theophylline 50 mg q.6h.
Ativan 1 mg t.i.d.
PRN Tylenol, Combivent, Haldol, Ativan, Hurricane and Ocean
Spray; Haldol dose is 1 to 2 mg i.v.q.2-4h., Ativan is 0.5 to
1 mg q.2-4h.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.

OTHER DIAGNOSES:
Status post tracheostomy.

ADDENDUM:  The patient had an echocardiogram that was not
significant for any decreased left ventricular ejection
fraction or other reasons for congestive heart failure; for
the most part, normal.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable on ventilator.
