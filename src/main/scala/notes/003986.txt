Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
 63 YO F with Parkinson's and dementia (recent baseline oriented
times 1) p/w hypotension, hypoxia and AMS from her NH.
Conflicting reports about what happened at NH per the ED but as
per EMT notes the patient became pale and diaphoretic then
unresponsive with episodes of apnea. Her VS when EMTs arrived
where 97.1 90/40 98 14 and 88% on RA. She was placed on a NRB
with sat of 91%. She remained intermittently responsive with
moaning.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, VS were: 95 102/62 14 95% on unclear
amount of oxygen. Paitent was triggered with a BP of 90. Per
report her SBP did decrease to the 80s but was responsive to
fluids. A bedside u/s showed dilated RV with strain. She was
started on a heparin gtt due to c/f PE. Prior to heparin gtt,
rectal exam revealed brown guiac positive stool. Given
hypotension and recent surgery the ED was also concerned for
sepsis so the patient was given cefepime, vanc and levoflox. A
foley was placed with cloudy urine and u/a had >50 WBCs. Blood
and urine cultures were drawn. Exam was also notable for
purulent drainage and staples from his surgery on [**5-19**] so [**Month/Day (4) **]
spine was called. Per report, the ED was unable to express any
pus but did obtain a CT neck with contrast which did not show a
fluid collection.
.
Given c/f PE and unclear series of events, a CTA along with CT
A/P with contrast were completed and was notable for extensive
bilateral pulmonary emboli spanning from the distal main pulm
art to the distal segmental and subsegmental arteries along with
a LLL wedge-shaped lesion c/w an infarct.


Past Medical History:
Parkinson's for 15 years. Dementia worse for the last 1 year.
Obesity. No history of CVA, cancer, MI or other chronic
illnesses. Usually blood pressure is low. She has a history of
multiple falls.

sometimes dependent on cane also. She is a retired school
teacher. No smoking, alcohol or drugs.

Pertinent Results:
LOWER EXTREMITY U/S:
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation of
the
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal
veins was
performed. There is extensive occlusive thrombus in the left
superficial
femoral vein extending to the popliteal vein. Right-sided veins
are patent
with normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation. Calf veins
were not
visualized due to patient's body habitus.
IMPRESSION: DVT throughout the entire left superficial femoral
vein extending through the popliteal vein.
.
CT CHEST:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are extensive bilateral
pulmonary emboli extending from the bilateral distal main
pulmonary arteries into the lobar, segmental and subsegmental
branches. There is an area of hypoenhancing wedge-shaped opacity
at the left lung base which is most consistent with pulmonary
infarct. Small amount of atelectasis is also noted at the left
lung base.

There is mild bowing of the interventricular septum, concerning
for right
heart strain. The main pulmonary artery is also mildly enlarged.
There is
also a trace pericardial effusion.

There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. The
airways are patent.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Please note that there is
significant
artifact from the patient's overlying arms limiting evaluation.
The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and
intra-abdominal loops of bowel are within normal limits.
Multiple tiny hypodensities are noted in the kidneys
bilaterally, too small to characterize. A small cyst is noted
within the interpolar region of the left kidney.

Gallbladder is distended but otherwise normal in appearance.
There is no
retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No free air or
free fluid is present.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a large amount of
stool within
the rectum. A Foley catheter is noted within a decompressed
bladder. Small
amount of air within the bladder is likely due to recent
instrumentation.
There is no free fluid. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is
present.

BONE WINDOWS: No concerning osseous lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, spanning from the
distal main
pulmonary arteries into the lobar, segmental and subsegmental
branches. Area of pulmonary infarct in the left lower lobe.
Mildly enlarged main pulmonary artery suggests component of
pulmonary hypertension. In addition, bowing of the
interventricular septum raises concern for right heart strain.
Recommend echocardiogram for further evaluation of cardiac
function.
2. No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.
3. Subcutaneous air noted in the right arm, incompletely
assessed.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 YO F with Parkinson's and progressive dementia s/p recent
hospitalization for fall with 2 c-spine operations now
presenting with altered mental status, hypoxia and hypotension
found to have submassive pulmonary emboli on imaging.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: She was found to have extensive bilateral
pulmonary emboli on chest CT with evidence of right heart strain
and slightly elevated troponin. She was started on a heparin
drip for systemic anticoagulation. She remained hemodynamically
stable in the ICU and was transferred to the floor. On [**6-8**], pt
was started on Warfarin, and her INR was trended.
.
# LLE DVT: LENI's done on [**2135-6-7**] demonstrated DVT throughout
the entire left superficial femoral vein extending through the
popliteal vein. There was concern that due to her high clot
burden in her lungs, pt would not tolerate another PE. Heme/onc
was consulted. Through review of the literature it appeared that
IVC filters had their greatest benefit in the first few days of
DVT (up to 12 days). However, given concern that there would be
difficulty in retrieving the filter, we opted to first repeat
LENI's to assess for clot progression since it was found on
[**2135-6-6**]. It showed extension into the femoral artery, and the
study was unable to visualize extension into the pelvis. Given
concern for clot progression, and IVC filter was placed on
[**2135-6-10**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] indicated the filter
could be retrieved in approx 4 weeks time. Please call to
schedule an appointment for this by calling Dr.[**Name (NI) 8664**]

# Altered mental status: On the morning of [**2135-6-10**], pt was found
to be unresponsive even to sternal rub around 0800. She had been
seen earlier that morning around 0630 and had been sleeping, but
awakened to voice and was trying to speak. Pt found to have O2
sats 96% on RA; an ABG was done which showed mild respiratory
alkolosis but PO2 was normal. Pt had stat head CT without which
showed no acute intracranial abnormality. Neuro was consulted,
who suggested that some of her mental status changes could be
attributed to her severe [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body dementia. However, seizure
was also on the DDx.  An EEG was ordered, but t
