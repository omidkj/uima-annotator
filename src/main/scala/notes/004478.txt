seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with focal
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG, CHF, DM, PVD who initially
presented with NSTEMI complicated by respiratory distress.

1) CAD:  Pt with known CAD and is s/p CABG ([**2120**]) and cath
([**2132**]) showing 2VD and PTCA of SVG->RCA.  On admission was c/o
CP and SOB; ECG was unremarkable but had positive cardiac
enzymes.  Heparin, Integrilin and Nitro IV infusions started as
well as continued Pt on ASA, BB, ACEi and statin.  Pt to floor
with expectation of possible catherization in AM.  Catherization
later that day significant for hemodynamics of CVP 5, PAP 43/15,
PCWP 11 and CO 4.69/CI 2.59.  It showed right dominant system
with 30% LMCA, Diag 60%, LCx TO with collaterals, RCA TO with
collaterals, SVG->OM TO, SVG->RCA patent with jump to PDA
patent.  The thinking being that the culprit lesion was probably
an occlusion of a small PDA, not a good PCI target thus no
intervention was taken.  Vent-gram at the time showed preserved
LV function (40%) when compared to [**2131**].  Cath course was
without complication.  Pt was maintained on medical regimen as
outlined above.  Nitro gtt was slowly tapered off with
up-titrating of ACEi for good BP control and no return of chest
pain.  CE's peaked during that first day and quickly trended
down.  Pt never complained of CP for remaining of hospital stay.
 Pt to be discharged on a home regimen of ASA, BB, Statin, ACEi
as detailed below.  Pt to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.

2) Pump:  At cath LV function preserved with LVEF 40%.  HD were
significant for normal right sided and mildly elevated left
sided filling pressures with mild pulmonary hypertension.  CXR
at admission with some suggestion of CHF.  On admission was in
mild respiratory distress requiring oxygen by face mask.  Pt
received several doses of Lasix with good diuresis  but minimal
improvement in respiratory status..  On the floor, Pt with
respiratory failure (described below).  Given clinical picture
and history CHF was suspected etiology.  Pt not improved with
diuresis and eventually required intubation.  Pt was a confusing
picture since on exam Pt appeared volume overloaded and in CHF
given rales and CXR, however intra cath PCWP of only 11.  There
was some question as to nitro's effect on depressing the wedge
pressure.  Given as fore-mentioned HDs, aggressive diuresis not
warranted, however Pt
