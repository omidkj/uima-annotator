Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
"can't catch my breath after walking 20 feet or even button my
pants!"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis x2


History of Present Illness:
77yo M w/ COPD with interstitial lung disease, pulm HTN, severe
cor pulmonale, and chronic renal disease who p/w worsening SOB,
increasing abdominal girth, and 20 lb wt gain for 2 weeks.

Pt reports feeling exhausted and "terrible." He is becoming
short of breath after walking ~20-25 feet from the bathroom to
the living room, having stop and catch his breath, which is
unusual for him.  At the same time, he was noted to have
increasing weight--a gain of 20 lbs over 2 wks (198 -> 218 lbs).
 Accordingly, he then developed "belly pain" and began having
trouble buttoning his pants over his growing abd.
Because of these increasing symptoms, he was brought to the ED
for further evaluation.

Of note, the pt has had a precipitous decline in his functional
status since [**10-26**] primarily due to symptoms of end-stage cor
pulmonale from his severe pulm disease.  In [**11-26**], pt developed
similar symptoms of SOB, abd distension, and wt gain and was
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for a total of 12 days.

Pt otherwise denies fever/chills, chest pain, palpitations,
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, headache/dizziness, or incontinence.

Echocardiography [**2110-5-27**] at 2:01:13 PM
The right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. Normal left ventricular systolic function. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is no
mass/thrombus in the right ventricle. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid
valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis
with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. Severe pulmonary hypertension. No
evidence of intracardiac shunt.

SINGLE AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There is a right
lower lobe opacity in comparison with multiple prior studies,
likely represents epicardial fat exaggerated by lordotic
technique and patient rotation. With the exception of this,
there are no focal consolidations. There is no pulmonary edema.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is
enlarged, stable. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Study Date of [**2110-5-22**] 9:00 AM
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver echotexture is
normal. There is
no focal liver lesion or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The main
portal vein is patent with the appropriate direction of flow,
though flow is noted to be pulsatile. The heparic veins are also
dilated.

The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones. The common
duct is not dilated, measuring 2 mm. The pancreas is not
visualized. The spleen is normal in size, measuring 8.5 cm. A
moderate to large amount of ascites is seen in all quadrants.

IMPRESSION: Probable passive hepatic congestion related to
right-sided heart failure, particularly in light of relatively
pulsatile blood flow in the portal vein. Normal liver
echotexture and spleen size. Large amount of
ascites.
