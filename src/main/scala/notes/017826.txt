History of Present Illness:
59 year old male with ESRD on HD, dilated
cardiomyopathy, DM, HTN, ETOH abuse presents with respiratory
distress. Per the family, this evening he began to have
nausea/vomtiing, diaphoresis, chest discomfort and shortness of
breath. The shortness of breath/Chest pain came on relatively
suddenly; the family subsequently called EMS. On arrival EMS
noted him to be in respiratory distress,SBP 190s and
diaphoretic. The notes show that the monitior showed ?
elevations; SPO2 52% and put on NRB and then he became
bradycardic, PEA arrested; ventilated him and he regained
pulses, pulses regained en route to hospital. He was taken to
[**Hospital3 **], IO line placed en route. He was intubated on
arrival, found to have K of 8.1, received Ca
Gluconate/D50/insulin/sodium bicarbonate, 100mg IV lasix, and
started on nitro gtt for hypertension (SBP 200s). ABG was
7.04/64/118/17. He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Upon arrival his vitals were 95.6 HR 80 BP 163/92 RR 21. An EKG
showed widening QRS (118) with peaked T waves. He was given
additional calcium gluconate 2mg,1 amp sodium bicarbonate, D50,
10U regular insulin, kayexlate 30g. He was continued on nitro
gtt for BP control in ED briefly for hypertension. CXR was done
which showed ET tube in the correct position as well as
pulmonary edema. His WBC was elevated at 30, blood cultures were
sent and Vancomycin/Zosyn were given. Renal was called for
urgent HD.
.
On arrival, pt sedated and intubated, unable to obtain further
history.

CHEST X-RAY: ([**2169-12-26**] 12:22 AM)
FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube is seen with tip positioned 4.4
cm above the level of the carina and a nasogastric tube is seen
with sideport and tip coursing below the diaphragm. Severe
bilateral air space consolidation has a generally symmetric
perihilar distribution, with interstitial abnormality,
consisting of thick septal lines and possible micronodulation,
at its periphery. There is no mediastinal venous engorgement,
cardiomegaly, or pleural effusion. The descending pulmonary
arteries are normal caliber; but the margins of the upper poles
of both hila are obscured by adjacent abnormal lung and could
[**Hospital1 **] adenopathy, particularly the left.
IMPRESSION: Although severe pulmonary consolidation and
interstitial
abnormality should be treated as largely or at least partially,
edema, the
absence of other features of heart failure, and the presence of
micronodularity, and possible hilar adenopathy, raise multiple
other
possiblities, including extensive malignancy, pneumonia and
pulmonary
hemorrhage. Repeat radiographs should be obtained after
treatment for
presumptive edema, and, if abnormalities persist, CT scanning
would be more definitive then.
.
ECHO [**2169-12-28**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
MRI head [**12-29**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct, mass effect, or
hydrocephalus
identified.
.
[**1-1**] CXR:
Indwelling devices remain in standard position, and
cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Lungs are
clear except
for minimal patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac area, likely
atelectasis.
.
[**1-6**] ECG:
Sinus bradycardia. Left axis deviation. Left bundle-branch
block. Poor R wave
progression in the anterior precordial leads likely normal
variant. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2170-1-5**] the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN
presented to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have
hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema,
successfully weaned overnight however with persistant agitation
and hypertension

#Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated once extubated and off
of sedation, he was requiring large amounts of haldol; and in
order to better evaluate his mental status with imaging he was
reintubated and sedated. Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at
home per day.  Unclear if agitation due to withdrawal from
opiates given strong ETOH/? Drug abuse history.  Other ddx may
include stroke vs viral encephalopathy. Patients family
interviewed again, have not found any evidence of other
substance use. Other Ddx considerations include embolic
phenomena from atrial fibrillation of unknown duration,
encephalitis (viral), withdrawal, etc. A CT head was negative. A
Lumbar Puncture was alsonegative.  MRI done also without
evidence of anoxic brain injury or other acute pathology.
Psychiatry was consulted; sedation was changed from propofol to
Precedex. He was initially treated with Haldol for agitation
been changed to zyprexa after QT was prolonged to 500.
Acyclovir was given empirically pending HSV PCR. Patient
extubated on [**1-1**] with significant improvement in mental status
however with persitently high requirement; psychiatry was
consulted. He was changed to zyprexa for agitation and this
improved over the course of his stay. On the floor, held all
mood-altering agents and saw patient's agitation resolve. Likely
[**12-26**] anoxia s/p PEA arrest, plus medication-induced (multiple
high-dose antipsychotics and sedative given in ICU) plus ICU
delirium; needed time for meds to clear and mental status to
clear. Resolved. Disorientation improved.
.
#Respiratory Distress-Initially most likely due to volume
overload and pulmonary edema in setting of malignant
hypertension and missing HD session. Now intubated for airway
protection and agitation. Vent settings at minimum. He was
treated for pneumonia with positive sputum cultures with
Vanc/zosyn. On the floor, improved respiratory status.

# ESRD/Hyperkalemia ?????? Resolved now. On presentation Presumed [**12-26**]
to patient missing HD session over the weekend. His EKG was
consistent with hyperkalemia; widened QRS and peak
