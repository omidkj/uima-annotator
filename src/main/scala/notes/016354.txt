HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year-old
female referred for an outpatient cardiac catheterization
after a positive stress test and anginal symptoms.  The
patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia
arrhythmias and angina for the past ten years.  She is status
post a non Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2171**].  She
presented to an outside hospital with complaints of
palpitations and chest pain.  She was found to be in rapid
atrial fibrillation and also had a run of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.  She also has a history of chest pain
with exertion for the last ten years, which is typically
relieved with nitroglycerin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation, cataract, brain
aneurysm question type, peripheral vascular disease, peptic
ulcer disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
Raynaud's disease, angina times ten years, non Q wave
myocardial infarction in [**2171**], hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, 40 pack year history of smoking.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Aortobifemoral bypass in [**2159**], right
lower extremity vascular surgery question type [**2174**], cataract
surgery, laminectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Pulmocort two puffs b.i.d., Combivent two puffs
q 4 hours, Nexium 20 mg q day, Lopressor 75 mg q.a.m., 50 mg
q.p.m.  Verapamil 180 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg q.d., Univasc
7.5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d., Meprobamate 400 mg t.i.d.,
sublingual nitroglycerin prn.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and had a
catheterization performed on [**2178-1-15**] with LMCA
heavily calcified, 70% proximal, 80% distal stenosis, left
anterior descending coronary artery 90% stenosis, left
circumflex 90% stenosis with obtuse marginal one and obtuse
marginal two 70% stenosis, right coronary artery calcified,
osteal 95% stenosis, ejection fraction was 55%.  See the
catheterization report for complete results.  The patient was
brought to the Operating Room on [**2178-1-18**] where she
had a coronary artery bypass graft times three with a left
internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and
posterior descending coronary artery.  The pericardium was
left open, atrial and ventricular wires were placed along
with mediastinal and left pleural tubes.  The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on neo-synephrine and
propofol drips.  The patient was extubated on postoperative
day one.

Later in the evening on postoperative day one the patient had
a ten second episode of asystole for which she was V paced
and recovered properly.  Electrophysiology Service saw the
patient on postoperative day two and decided to conduct
electrophysiologic studies.  On postoperative day two due to
minimal output the chest tubes were removed and a post pull
chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax and no effusions.  The
patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
three in stable condition.  By postoperative day four the
patient was studied by the Electrophysiology Service.  It was
decided at that time to start Amiodarone.  On postoperative
day five the patient had a 23 beat run of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia of which the EP Service was aware.
Her dose of Amiodarone was changed by that service.  The
patient had no more cardiac arrhythmias following that
episode.  The patient was screened by rehabilitation
facilities on postoperative six and began ambulating and
tolerating a regular diet.  On [**1-27**] the patient was in
stable condition and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts device was placed.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d., Lasix 20 mg
q.d. times seven days, potassium chloride 20 mg q.d. times
seven days, Plavix 75 mg q.d., Meprobamate 400 mg t.i.d.,
Protonix 40 mg q day, Captopril 25 mg t.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg
q.d., Amiodarone 400 mg q.d. times one month and 200 mg q.d.,
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d. times two days for a urinary
tract infection, Nexium 20 mg q.d., Pulmocort four puffs
b.i.d., Combivent two puffs q 4 hours, Colace 100 mg b.i.d.,
Percocet one to two tab q 6 hours prn.

chloride 89, bicarbonate 31, BUN 13, creatinine .4, glucose
117.

facility and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four weeks,
primary care physician and cardiologist in three weeks and
