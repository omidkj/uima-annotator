shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arteriovenous fistula placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 y/o female with poorly controlled HTN, h/o frequent
admssions for hypertensive urgency/emergency (negative w/u for
secondary causes), ESRD on HD, presented with dyspnea and was
found to have elevated blood pressure 200s/130s. She reports
compliance with medications, but she is not able to clearly
state names and dosages. She also complained of L chest pain,
frontal HA, pain under the anterior ribs bilaterally, and N/V,
all of which have now resolved. She denies visual changes,
weakness, slurred speech, dysarthria, confusion, or hematuria.
.
In ED, she was treated with 5 gm IV lopressor x 2, labetolol 20
mg IV, labetolol 40 mg IV x2, then Hydralazine 10 mg IV,
Hydralazine 20 mg IV x1, with improvement in BP. She recieved 80
mg IV lasix with mild response in urine output. She was then
transferred to the MICU for further care.
.
In the MICU, her blood pressure has now been well controlled on
her home PO medications, with the exception that her labetalol
was changed to metoprolol. She had hemodialysis yesterday and
again today (usual days T/Th/Sat). She also ruled out for MI.
She is currently asymptomatic and feels back at her baseline.
.
ROS negative.

galactorrhea. Pituitary MRI was negative. Resolved with
adjustment of risperidone dose.

rheumatologic disease, stroke, or sudden cardiac death.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 45 year old woman with poorly
controlled hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis
who presented with shortness of breath found to be in
hypertensive urgency.
.
1. Hypertensive Urgency: There was no evidence of end organ
damage (no neurologic deficits and ruled out for MI).  Her blood
pressure was initially controlled with iv medications.  The
likely trigger to this hypertensive episode was irregular
medication adherence.  Her prior evaluation for causes of
secondary hypertension did not reveal evidence consistent with
either endocrine or renovascular causes.  During her [**2143-1-30**]
evaluation she had an isolated aldosterone level of 37, however,
3 days later the an aldosterone and renin levels were measured
(7 and 9.2, respectively) and were not consistent with a primary
hyperaldosterone state.  Prior imaging of her adrenals by MRI
revealed normal size and signal to the glands.  Repeat
aldosterone and renin levels were drawn to confirm the prior
findings.  These labs were pending at time of discharge.  Her
blood pressure was ultimately stabilized on combination of
minoxidil and lisinopril with volume control by ultra-filtration
at hemodialysis.
.
2. Shortness of Breath: The presenting shortness of breath was
likely due to flash pulm edema in the setting of uncontrolled
hypertension. As above, she ruled out for MI.  Her breathing
improved with continued hemodialysis.
.
3. End-stage renal disease:  The patient has been dialysis
dependent secondary to her end-stage renal disease on a T/Th/Sat
schedule.  She had been scheduled to undergo an AV fistula
placementUsual schedule T/Th/Sat. Says has not missed HD
appointments. Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] of Nephrology and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 816**] of transplant.  She underwent an AV fistula placement in
the left arm without complications. Please the operative report
from  [**2143-10-4**] for details.  She continued on phosphate binders
while in the hospital.
.
4. Anemia: Multifactorial - ACD and contribution from renal
disease. Baseline HCT 23-30. No signs of active bleeding. Stable
hct. She received IV iron at HD. Erythopoetin adiministration
will be per nephrology team.
.
5. Low Serum Bicarbonate with AG of 18: This was thoughtly ikely
due to renal failure/uremia. The lab value improved with
dialysis.
.
6. Elevated CK, Trop: The patient presented with hypertensive
urgency and had a small elevation in her troponins and CK
consistent with demand ischemia in setting of hypertension and
pulmonary edema. An EKG revealed no acute ischemic changes.
.
7. Schizophrenia: Reports that she is followed at [**Hospital **]
Hospital, where she is treated with risperdone 25mg IM
injections every two weeks.  There was no evidence of acute
psychosis during this admission.  The patient will follow-up
with  her regular providers as previously scheduled.
.
8.) PPX: PPI, SC heparin
.
9.) Code: Full.
.
10.) Dispo: the patient was discharged in good condition with
stable vital signs to follow-up with 3x/week dialysis sessions.
