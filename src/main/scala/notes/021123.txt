History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with a history of Type 2 DM, atrial
fibrillations, hypertension and congestive heart failure who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life with a chief
complaint of dyspnea.  Per report, patient reports feeling
unwell x 2 weeks. She has been treated with lasix over the past
few days for hypoxia and a left pleural effusion. Today, O2 sats
in the 80s on 4L NC. Noted by CXR in ED to have a left pleural
effusion. Pt was admitted to MICU for CPAP. Did not tolerate
mask well and was switch to non-rebreather mask. with diuresis
on Lasix, her resp status improved.  Thoracentesis was deferred
in the MICU because she was supratherapeutic on coumadin with

ECHO ([**2131-4-19**]): Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. A small secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is present.
3.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity
size. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with
relative
sparing of the inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal
hypokinesis of the  apical free wall of the right ventricle.
Right ventricular systolic function  appears mildly depressed.
5. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
6. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-17**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
9.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
.
CXR [**2131-4-18**]:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL: There are no previous films
available for comparison. Bilateral pleural effusions are
present. The effusion on the left is large. Underlying
infiltrates in both lower lobes cannot therefore be excluded. No
evidence of failure is seen.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, large on the left side,
cause undermined.
.
.
[**2131-4-21**] CXR PA/Lat: Comparison to the prior chest x-ray of
[**2131-4-20**] shows considerable improvement in the vascular
engorgement. There is a moderate sized left effusion and a small
effusion at the right base. Heart size is difficult to evaluate
due to the overlying effusion.

IMPRESSION: Improving appearance of the chest since [**2131-4-20**]
with a moderate left and small right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with history of CHF, DM2, afib on coumadin who
presents from Nursing Home with progressive hypoxia and pleural
effusions.

1. Pulm: Hypoxia likely [**1-17**] to pleural effusions. Etiology of
effusions most likely CHF. Other possibilities include pneumonia
and malignancy, although pneumonia was unlikely given no white
counts and afebrile.  Given her INR of 5.5, thoracentesis
deferred until coagulopathy corrected.  Thoracentesis performed
on [**2131-4-23**] after coumadin reversed.  Fluid sent for cytology,
culture and cell count which are all pending.  CXR improved post
procedure with no pneumothorax.

2. Coagulopathy: Patient on coumadin for afib and history fo
clot, now supratherapeutic at 5.5. In the MICU, she was given
Vitamin K sc 10 mg with good effect.  Heparin gtt was
administered until her thoracentesis.  Her heparin was briefly
started on [**4-23**] in the afternoon and was discontinued at 4pm.
The patient should start lovenox 50mg q12 at 6pm until her INR
is within the therapeutic range of [**1-18**].  Warfarin 10mg x1 dose
was given [**4-23**] prior to discharge.

3. DM2: We continued NPH and RISS with qid fingersticks

4. Cardiac:
a. ischemia: No known CAD.  The patient was not on aspirin,
statin or betablocker.  Toprol was started and her calcium
channel blocker was discontinued.

b. pump: History of failure and found to have an elevated
proBNP>5000. It was unclear what tipped the patient over. She
was monitored on strict I&O's, daily weights (ranged 111-112
after diuresis), IV lasix PRN. Echo showed EF of 20%.
metoprolol was started and titrated up, her discharge dose will
be toprol 50mg qd with hold parameters.

c. rhythm: the patient history of atrial fibrillation and was
supratherapeutic on coumadin.  She was monitored on tele and
remained predominantly in atrial fibrillation.

5. Renal: her creatinine bumped from 1.2-1.5 to 1.6.  This is
likely due to a prerenal state due to low CO and diuresis.
Lasix was held on [**4-22**]-9.

6. FEN: cardiac diet with 1.5L fluid restriction.

7. PPx: PPI, supratherapuetic INR, bowel regimen, pneumoboots

8. CODE: DNR/DNI Per documentation and discussion with
healthcare proxy
