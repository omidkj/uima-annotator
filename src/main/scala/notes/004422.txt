History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo man with DM2, CKD (baseline most recently
~2.0), HTN, BPH, depression and a recent admission (discharged
[**5-26**]) for volume overload who was found at home today by his son
unresponsive.
.
EMS could not measure his FSBS because it was critically high.
In the ED, his initial VSs were 101.6, 231/74, 74, 20, 97% on
RA. Initial finger stick was 667 here, serum blood sugarwas 636.
Pt received 4 x 10 units of insulin IV (not started on drip) and
4L NS. In addition, he received vancomycin, levofloxacin and
metronidazole for his fever after cultures were drawn.
.
The pt was not able to give any additional history.
.
The pt's son, who spoke to the pt on the day prior to
presentation, reported that he had no complaints one day PTA. He
did not c/o chest pain, shortness of breath, pain with
urination, nausea, vomiitng, cough, sputum production or
headache. The pt's son did report that the pt has been sloppy
with his insulin compliance of late due to the recent loss of
the pt's wife.

Brief Hospital Course:
#HONK/DM2:  No known precipitant, although according to pt's
son, he likely has not been compliant with his insulin regimen
lately. There were no obvious infectious etiologies in spite of
his fever in the ED. His U/A was clean, his CXR and lung exam
were essentially normal. He had not been c/o headache, and he
had no WBC count. An LP done over 12hrs after abx started showed
a white count of 98, mostly PMNs, without any organism on gram
stain or culture.  There was no evidence of an acute coronary
syndrome either by history or on EKG.  The patient was
aggressively volume repleted, treated with insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] protocol, and rapidly stabilized his blood sugars.  Once
on the floor, the Pt. tolerated full diabetic diet, FSG
initially ranging from 196-238, but improving to 72-189 once his
home regimen of insulin (25am/10pm) was restarted. Plan on
continuing home regimen with close outpatient f/u.
.
## Fever: White count not elevated, no infiltrate on CXR, U/A
clean. As above, LP somewhat questionable considering earlier
dose of Abx.  Pt. was started on  meningitis dosing of
vancomycin, ceftriaxone and acyclovir for a 10 day course, which
will be completed on [**6-13**]. On the floor the pt. was afebrile, no
leukocytosis,  no growth on cultures, clean chest film and clean
U/A. Also, the pt. was without any symptoms.  A PICC line was
placed for further Abx therapy and good glycemic control was
continued.  Consider dosing his Vanc by level, giving 1g for
trough less than 15.  As before, course will be complete on
[**6-13**].
.
##Delirium: Likely related to HHNS and perhaps fever. Head CT
within normal limits. No evidence of other ingestions on tox
screens or history per son.  Once on the floor the patient was
AAOx1-2, and at baseline, according to discussion with son and
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved versus admission.  We continued to re-orient
as needed, and assist with feedings/ambulation as needed.
.
## HTN: Pt hypertensive to 220s/70s in the ED. Did not received
any antihypertensives. First, he was started with IV labetalol
with goal SBP in the 160s and chased with PO labetalol once NGT
was in place.  On the floor, as his renal function improved we
restarted first his ACEI and then his [**Last Name (un) **].
.
## CKD: Cr 2.0 at last discharge, baseline per records from
1.6-2.0, raised to 2.4 on this admission but now back to 1.6.
At discharge he appears hydrated on exam.  His I/Os were
near-neutral without his home dos aging of diuretics.  He may
need to restart some dose of these diuretics in the near future.
.
##CHF:  Pt. with stable weight near 235lbs.  PLan to continue
daily weights, and restart diuretics when needed for fluid
retention.  His home regimen was Metolazone 5 mg qam, 30 minutes
prior to furosemdie 80mg (daily).  Perhaps one could first
restart his lasix and then add the metolazone if needed.
.
## Elevated troponin: Likely secondary to CKD and ARF. No EKG
changes suggestive of ischemia. Pt has no documented hx of CAD,
but given DM2, likely has underlying co
