CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post right coronary artery stent
secondary to myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year-old
male intubated and sedated upon arrival.  History was taken
from medical records only.  The patient without history of
coronary artery disease presented to outside hospital with
complaints of chest pain.  The patient noted that he felt
lightheaded and called EMS to be transported to outside
hospital.  Initial laboratories there showed a troponin I of
less then 0.04.  Electrocardiogram with bradycardia, left
axis deviation and ST elevations in 2, 3 and AVF, V3-V5 and
ST depressions in AVL, V2, V1 also with a right bundle branch
block.  He was given aspirin, morphine and fluids in the
field and then the Emergency Department gave him atropine,
started a Dopamine and heparin drip.  At that point he went
into a wide complex tachycardia, which was read as V
fibrillation and was shocked with 200 jewels with conversion
to junctional rhythm of 100 beats per minute and the patient
at that point was hemodynamically stable.  The patient was
given a half a dose of Retavase for lytic therapy and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation and catheterization.

The patient was intubated prior to arrival to [**Hospital1 346**].  In the [**Hospital1 190**] the patient was sinus tachy, normal axis,
normal intervals, 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevation in inferior leads
and anterior leads.  He was taken to the catheterization
laboratory.  Catheterization wet read showed a three vessel
disease with left anterior descending coronary artery totally
occluded, left circumflex was 40% lesion and right coronary
artery with a 95% mid vessel lesion thought to be the culprit
lesion.  He had an angiojet and his right coronary artery was
stented at that point at which point he was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit for further observation and
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No past medical history was recorded.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  The only medication was recorded was Benadryl
prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Recorded as two packs per day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with myocardial infarction and mother
with myocardial infarction and brother with myocardial
infarction at the age of 59.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs upon arrival to the
Emergency Department, pulse of 71 and blood pressure of
106/palp and afebrile.  Generally he was a frail appearing
male intubated and sedated. HEENT pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  No lymphadenopathy.
No JVD.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs,
rubs or gallops appreciated.  Pulmonary was not examined.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 139, potassium 3.6,
chloride 105, bicarb 27, BUN 10, creatinine 1.1, glucose 108,
white blood cell 9.2, hematocrit 42.8, platelet 440, MCV 101.
INR .91 and PTT of 28.2.  The troponin I of less then 0.04.
Chest x-ray showed EP tube in right main, opacity in
retrocardiac, possible atelectasis versus pneumonia and on
arrival his electrocardiogram was pending.  His
catheterization showed an RA of 23/24/22, RV of 33/23, PA
33/22, wedge of 22/24, [**3-24**], LV of 90/22, SVR 1082 and PVR of
25.  His EF was 39% with hypokinetic anterolateral apical and
inferior walls.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was status post stent mid right
coronary artery.  For his coronary artery disease three
vessel disease.  He was continued on aspirin and Plavix and
did well.  His beta blockers were initially held secondary to
bradycardia and negative inotropic effects.  At that point
later on he was switched over two days later to beta
blockers. On discharge date his beta blockers were switched
over from Metoprolol 75 b.i.d. to Toprol XL 150 q.d.  His
lipids were checked and liver function tests were checked.
He had an elevated AST, slightly elevated ALT at which point
Lipitor was not started, but the day of discharge Lipitor was
started given that his AST rise was most likely secondary to
his myocardial infarction insult.  He may need future
percutaneous intervention on left anterior descending
coronary artery and D1.  His CKs were followed post
intervention and the goal was to keep the CVP around 18 to
20.  He did well after transfer to the Emergency Department
and was extubated the next day and weaned off of his O2 and
transferred to the floor.

For his pump status he was later on started on Captopril and
on the day of discharge his Captopril t.i.d. was switched to
Lisinopril q.d. for after load reduction.

Rhythm, his electrolytes were checked regularly.  The goal
was to keep his K over 4 and his magnesium over 2.  Initially
he was continued on the Lidocaine drip until the morning
after admission to the Coronary Care Unit at which point he
was discontinued off the Lidocaine.  He had an atropine at
bedside for possible bradycardia and secondary hypotension
secondary to bradycardia, which was not used and his beta
blockers as we noted earlier was held on the first day and
later on started as he tolerated it.  The day after admission
he was started on Levaquin for presumed right lower lobe
consolidation secondary to community acquired pneumonia.  The
patient did well and has been afebrile and white blood cell
count decreasing daily since transfer to the floor.  For him
to continue a ten day course of Levaquin.  He is now on day
three of ten and will continue the next seven days when
discharged to home or to rehab.

Gastrointestinal, no issues.  Tolerating his medications and
his diet well.

The patient was sent to rehab center for further evaluation
and further treatment.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
Inferior myocardial infarction status post right coronary
artery stent.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with his
primary care physician and also with cardiologist in the next
week or two for post discharge care.  Call for an
appointment.

MAJOR SURGICAL INVASIVE PROCEDURES DONE:  Status post right
coronary artery stent and catheterization.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg po q..d
3.  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q.d. for the next seven days, that
will be a ten day regimen.
4.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
5.  Thiamine 100 mg po q.d.
6.  Folic acid 1 mg po q.d.
