Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory compromise with hypoxia and hypercarbia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
46 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, OSA, COPD,
chronic trach, who was hospitalized in [**2134-4-3**] with VAP
(cultures + for acinetobacter and pseudomonas), who presents
with fever, hypoxia and multifocal pneumonia on CXR. He
initially traveled to [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2134-6-24**] with oxygen saturations
between 78-82% and somnolence. He was started on ceftazidime,
vancomycin, flagyl and levofloxacin. A femoral line was placed,
cultures drawn, and his trach was changed from a 6.0 Shily w/o
cuff to a 6.0 portex cuff trach.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-6-24**] with a temp of 101.3, HR
110, and BP 157/83. An ABG showed pH7.24 pCO2 81 pO2 76 on 100%
trach collar. He was then ventilated on PS 10/5. Repeat ABG was
pH 7.24 pCO2 79 pO2 88.
In the MICU, [**2-6**] blood cultures were positive for GPC, with
sputum and urine cultures still pending.  Wide spectrum
antibiotics were chnaged to ampicillin, although it remains
uncertain if the bacteria are, in fact, ampicillin sensitive,
despite clinical improvement.  Source remains uncertain.  He has
continued to tolerate the trach mask with high saturations on
venous blood gas.  He remains on 50% csm with saturations to the
high 90's and a respiratory rate in the teens.  Suction for the
trach has remained q3-4hrs.  Transferred to floor on [**6-27**].

neuropathy): Cr has been as low as 1 in the past few months,
however widely fluctuant when hospitalized 1-2.5.

[**2134-6-28**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. No vegetation seen (cannot exclude).


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 46 yo M with h/o morbid obesity, OSA, COPD,
chronic trach, recent hospitalization in [**4-/2134**] with VAP with
cultures + for acinetobacter and pseudomonas who presented to
[**Location (un) 620**] on [**6-24**] with O2 sats of 78-82% and somnolence. He was
given ceftazidime, vancomycin, flagyl and levofloxacin. Cultures
were drawn. His trach was changed from a 6.0 Shily w/o cuff to a
6.0 portex cuff trach. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was
febrile to 101 and his ABG was notable for pH 7.24 pCO2 81 pO2
76 on 100% trach collar. He was then ventilated on PS 10/5.
Repeat ABG was pH 7.24 pCO2 79 pO2 88. He was started on
vanco/gent. While in the MICU, his respiratory status improved
and his blood cultures were notable for [**2-6**] Enterococcus so his
abx were changed to ampicillin and he defervesced (he will need
to complete a 14 day course of amp - to be completed on [**2134-7-9**]).
He was transferred to the floor on [**6-27**]. He did well until pm of
[**6-29**] when he became tachypneic. The tachypnea improved with
suctioning. On [**6-30**], he again became tachypneic to RR 40s and O2
sats decreased to 79% on 40% trach mask.  Respiratory therapy
got little mucus return with suctioning so they bagged him with
improvement in O2 sats to 99%. He was changed to 100% trach mask
with O2 sats 97-99% but continued tachpnea in 30s so he was
transferred to the ICU team for PS o/n.  The patient was
supported on pressure support ventilation and his setting were
weaned down.  He did well with a trach mask on [**2134-7-2**].  His
blood pressure continued to be elevated.  He was restarted on
his home labetalol and clonidine.  He was started on captopril
which was titrated up during the course of admission.  If his BP
remains elevated at rehab, his clonidine dose can be increased.

Regarding the patients chronic back pain, he was given PO
dilaudid PRN which was sufficient for pain control.  Increasing
his pain medication should be avoided.

The patient was hypoglycemic at times during his MICU course.
His home insulin regimen was Insulin Glargine 50 units [**Hospital1 **] and
Humalog SS.  His glargine was cut in half to 25 units [**Hospital1 **].  If
his sugars are elevated while at rehab, his lantus can be
increased back to his home regimen.
