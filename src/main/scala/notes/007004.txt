Admission Date: [**2179-4-1**]        Discharge Date: [**2179-4-5**]


Service:  CCU


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 86-year-old female
with a history of CABG and CABG re-do in [**2166**].  Initial CABG
in [**2156**] was RCA bypass, SVG to PDA aneurectomy; SVG to PDA,
SVG to OM2.  The patient's history is also significant for
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, EF 15 percent, and was admitted
with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain.
The patient was recently admitted from [**2179-3-22**] to [**2179-3-23**]
and ruled out for myocardial infarction.  She had
biventricular pacer placed on [**2178-9-24**].  It is a [**Company 1543**]
InSync type III.  On admission the patient had atrial
fibrillation, as well as old left bundle-branch block.  The
patient was found to be in rapid ventricular response at 150 to
170 beats per minute. EP was called to evaluate the patient.  The
patient had an increased shortness of breath and secondary to
respiratory distress was intubated.  Her systolic blood
pressure at that time was 120, diastolic 70.  Pacemaker
interrogation by EP demonstrated atrial fibrillation and the
patient was admitted to the CCU.

ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT'S ALLERGIES ARE QUESTION PROCAINAMIDE
AND QUESTION BACTRIM.

1. Coumadin, dose unknown.
2. Aspirin 81 mg once a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone, no tobacco, no current ETOH
use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's data on admission:  EKG,
atrial fibrillation with left bundle-branch block at 150.
Echocardiogram on [**2178-7-17**], left atrial enlargement, left
ventricular dilation; LV EF of 15 percent; TR gradient 43; 3
plus MR, 1 plus TR.  Cardiac catheterization on [**2167-8-5**]
LJA/RJA, LV EF 32 percent; pRCA 100 percent, origin PDA 90
percent, SVG to DRCA okay, LMCA 20 percent, PLCx 80 percent.
Chest x-ray consistent with CHF.  First troponin 0.01, sodium
is 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 20,
creatinine 0.8, glucose is 216, white count 23.9, hematocrit
45.6, platelet count 418, INR 2.7.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature on admission
was 98.9 degrees, heart rate 95, respiratory rate 12, blood
pressure 140/85.  Generally, the patient is intubated and in
no distress.  HEENT is normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRL.
Oropharynx again intubated.  Neck is supple.  JVD is elevated
to 12 cm.  Respiratory rate, coarse breath sounds at the
bases bilaterally, as well as decreased breath sounds
bilaterally.  Heart is irregular, no murmurs.  Abdomen is
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities are free of any
clubbing or cyanosis;  there is 2 plus pitting edema and a
right internal jugular line is placed.  No hematoma, no
pulsatile masses, or bruits.  The femoral pulses are 2 plus;
no bruits or pallor auscultated; 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulses
are palpated.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  Respiratory distress, which is
felt likely secondary to CHF.  The patient was maintained on
her intubated state for approximately 24 hours.  She was
maintained on aggressive diuresis with goal negative 1 to 2
liters a day and was subsequently extubated without difficulty.

CHF:  Felt due to AF with rapid ventricular response and lose of
ventricular resynchronization due to LBBB conducction in AF.
There was also a question of pneumonia versus atypical infection.
Given that repeat chest x-ray had
question of left upper lobe infiltrate in the setting of an
increased white count.  The patient was aggressively
diuresed, initially was maintained on nitroglycerin, which
was weaned off.  She was maintained on Lasix with good effect
and was continued on her outpatient Digoxin.  The patient had
good diuretic effect.

Cardiac arrhythmia:  The patient is with atrial fibrillation
with RVR.  The patient was initially rate controlled with
beta blocker and amiodarone was subsequently added with good
effect.

ID:  Question of left upper lobe infiltrate with the setting
of increased white count.  The patient was maintained on
levofloxacin for a total of 7 days.

Code:  The patient is a full code.

Atrial fibrillation:  The patient also underwent TEE
cardioversion and subsequently was maintained on amiodarone.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged on [**2179-4-5**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg one by mouth q.d.
2. Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.

   after done with the 28 days of amiodarone 200 mg 3 times a
   day.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Ischemic congestive heart failure with an EF of 15
   percent.
2. Atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion.
3. Status post coronary artery bypass graft with re-do.
4. Coronary artery disease.


DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient was discharged to home with VNA
for management of congestive heart failure.
