Chief Complaint:
syncope, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
EGD

History of Present Illness:
Patient was admitted today to [**Hospital1 1516**] and being transferred to CCU.
Please refer to [**Hospital1 1516**] note for further detail.

In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo male with CAD s/p MI and CABG in
[**2162**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1-OM2, occluded SVG - PDA), s/p two cypher
stents to SVG-OM1-OM2 graft in [**2175**], HTN and HLD. He was
transferred from OSH  after a syncope at 3 am this morning. EKG
in ED showed evidence of a recent IMI (new Q waves with residual
ST elevations).
.
Per [**Hospital1 1516**] admission note, urgent cath showed occlusion of the
jump segment of his SVG-OM1 graft, which was stented
successfully with 2 drug-eluting stents. However, the OM1 was
jailed and could only be rescued to TIMI 2 flow.
.
On the floor today, he had one episode of chest pain in the
afternoon which resolved with sublingual nitro after which he
had SBP 70s; this resolved. He had no recurring chest pain
during the day. This evening at 9PM, he tried to get out of bed
to use commode. Eyes rolled back into head, became unresponsive,
SBP 70s with no change in rate. Was placed in Trendelenberg, was
given IVF, woke up on his own.
.
Upon interview by resident, patient was awake, oriented,
comfortable, angry about lab draws and denied any chest pain
during episode. Tele was not caught at time of episode because
he was getting up to use the bathroom.
.
Patient was fatigued and did not want to share history on
admission to CCU. He did deny chest pain. Per admission note, he
complains of chronic fatigue but found that 1-2 weeks ago he
started to have shortness of breath to the degree that he was
only able to walk a few steps. Of note, the patient paused
aspirin and plavix three weeks ago for 12 days for his laser BPH
surgery.

LABS/STUDIES
EKG ([**2180-11-21**]): Heart Rate: 59, Inferior Q waves with 1/2 MM STE
II,III, repeat EKG with hypotension shows STE in < 1mm II, and
II

Pertinent Results:
[**11-21**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated three
vessel disease. The LMCA, LAD, and LCx were known to be occluded
and
were not evaluated. The RCA was a small, non-dominant vessel
with
diffuse disease.
2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated that the
SVG-OM1-OM2 was
occluded at the segment from OM1-OM2. The SVG-PDA was not
accessed as it
was known to be occluded. The LIMA-LAD was not engaged.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood
pressure with SBP 105mmHg and DBP 52mmHg.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the jump segment of
SVG-OM1-OM2 with
two overlapping 3.0x28mm Promus drug eluting stents.
5. Successful rescue of jailed OM1 with PTCA alone restoring
TIMI 2
flow.
6. Successful closure of right femoral arteriotomy with 6F
angioseal.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Occluded OM1-OM2 jump graft.
3. Successful PCI of SVG-OM1-OM2 with DES x2 overlapping.
4. Successful rescue of jailed OM1 with PTCA alone restoring
TIMI2 flow.
5. Successful RFA angioseal.

[**11-23**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely
depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to
akinesis/dyskinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. There are
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2180-4-12**], the left ventricular
ejection fraction is further reduced.

EGD [**11-24**]
Impression: Small hiatal hernia
Irrregular z-line noted and patchy areas of erythema consistent
with esophagitis was noted at GE junction. A single tongue of
salmon colored mucosa was noted at the GE junction suggesting
possible Barrett's esophagus.
Erythema in the antrum compatible with antral gastritis
4 mm ulcer in the pre-pyloric region
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Recommend continuing protonix at 40 mg PO bid.
Patient will need outpatient GI follow up for testing for
H.pylori by H.pylori breath test and treat if necessary.
Will need repeat endoscopy after 2 months to ensure ulcer
healing.

DISCHARGE LABS:


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo male with CAD (s/p CABG x4 [**2162**], s/p two
cypher stents to SVG-OM1-OM2 in [**2175**]), HTN and HLD who was
transferred from OSH after an episode of syncope and chest pain
whose cath showed occlusion of the jump segment of his SVG-OM1
graft which was subsequently dilated.
.
# SYNCOPE: Managed empirically on stress dose steroids in the
setting of a known history of panhypopituitarism until the
patient's Hct dropped to 24.5 from 32 at baseline and was found
to have melena. At that time he was transfused 2 units of pRBCs
and started on an IV PPI; GI was subsequently consulted. The
patient's Hct responded appropriately to the transfusion, he was
transfused a further 1 unit of pRBCs and transitioned to PO
Protonix, and stress dose steroids were stopped; He had EGD with
GI here which showed ulcer in the pre-pylorus with non-active
bleeding. His Famotidine was stopped and Protonix started on
discharge.
.
# Inferior STEMI: Patient underwent a Cath for ST elevations
suggestive of an inferior MI.  Please see cath report for full
details.  In brief, Patient was noted to have three vessel
coronary disease, occluded OM1-OM2 jump graft, successful PCI of
SVG-OM1-OM2 with DES x2 overlapping, and successful resc
