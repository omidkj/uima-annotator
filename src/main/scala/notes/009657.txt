Admission Date:  [**2186-11-21**]       Discharge Date: [**2186-11-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2123-6-23**]       Sex:  M


CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Painless jaundice.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 63 year old man with
a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery
obstructive sleep apnea, sent to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital with one day
of painless jaundice on [**2186-11-17**].  The patient also
had noted one month of pruritus at that time without any
fever, chills, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis or abdominal pain.

At the [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] he had a total bilirubin of 12.0, direct of
ultrasound revealed two lesions in the liver, each 2
centimeters, consistent with metastases.  An endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography was attempted but was
unsuccessful secondary to infiltration/edematous folds over
the ampulla.  The patient cannot have his duct cannulated,
and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation.

At the [**Hospital1 69**], the patient had
no endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and
underwent sphincterotomy, however, the duct still cannot be
cannulated and the plan was made for a repeat endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography at another time.  He was
then transferred to the Medical Floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2 for 20 years, insulin dependent
15 years with mild retinopathy.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2181**] for three vessel disease.
3.  [**Last Name (un) **]-vesicular fistula.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease status post right
aortofemoral bypass.
5.  Nephrotic syndrome, unknown etiology, diagnosed in
[**10/2186**] with 3.6 grams of protein q. 24 hours, positive
P-ANCA and positive [**Doctor First Name **] per outside hospital.
6.  Anemia of unclear etiology.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AS AN OUTPATIENT:
1.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Pravachol 40 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Toprol XL 100 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Glucophage 500 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  NPH 50 units q. a.m. and 20 units q. h.s.; Regular 10
units q. a.m.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives alone with a dog.  He
drinks alcohol on occasion.  He smokes occasionally after
meals.  He denies any drug use.  His sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 46850**] is
his only family member.  [**Name (NI) **] phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 46851**],
work at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 46852**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Blood pressure 100/palpable; heart
rate 53, 14 and 97% on room air.  170 pounds.  In general, he
is lethargic and jaundiced in no acute distress.  Cor:
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs
clear to auscultation bilaterally with poor effort.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities with trace edema bilaterally; no dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was admitted for further
evaluation of his painless jaundice.  The patient was
lethargic and mildly hypotensive on arrival on the floor from
ERCP Suite.  The patient responded with intravenous fluids in
time.  The patient's course was complicated by acute renal
failure which will be discussed, however, repeat Endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography under general anesthesia
which had been planned for the next day was unable to be
performed.  The patient could not have an abdominal CT scan
with contrast secondary to a rise in creatinine.

He was evaluated for MRCP however, he could not undergo this
procedure secondary to his excessive movement and agitation.
The patient's transaminases remained slightly elevated.  ALT
was 69, now 251, AST 48 and now 267.  LDH has remained
normal.  Alkaline phosphatase was 86 and now increased to
1211, amylase started at 39 and increased to 109.  Total
bilirubin started at 0.4, which was probably a false [**Location (un) 1131**]
and now elevated at 6.6 with direct of 4.5, indirect 2.1.

The patient will have a repeat endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography on admission whenever he is
medically stable enough to undergo this further evaluation.
Also of note, the patient had a highly elevated CA19-9 up to
27,834 at the outside hospital, concerning for malignancy.
Other possibilities include other biliary disease.

2.  Acute renal failure:  The patient had underlying renal
disease of nephrotic syndrome of unclear etiology.  The
patient's urine output dropped to oliguric level on hospital
days one and two.  BUN increased from 50 up to 65 and
creatinine rose from 2.5 to 5.0.  Potassium also increased to
hyperkalemic levels.  Bicarbonate initially was 12 which
increased to 15 with bicarbonate therapy.  He remained with
hypodynamic acidosis.  Due to the patient's underlying renal
disease and new acute renal failure, Renal was consulted.
Work-up of this likely acute glomerular nephritis or
post-Streptococcal glomerular nephritis was pending at this
time with antibodies.

He also underwent a renal ultrasound which was essentially
negative with no signs of hydronephrosis.

3.  Anemia:  The patient has a ferritin of 10 with TIBC of
312 near his admission time.  He was already on iron
replacement and continued on this.  He did have occasional
guaiac positive stools and it is unclear the reason for this.


4.  Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was admitted on insulin
as well as oral hypoglycemics.  Oral medications were
initially held.  The patient's insulin was cut in half while
he was n.p.o..  The patient's glucose continued to drop and
he became hypoglycemic into the 60s for his renal failure.
Due to longer instance of insulin renal failure, the patient
was taken off his insulin and placed on a Regular insulin
sliding scale.

5.  Neurological:  Per report the patient was alert and
oriented prior to the endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography. Following the procedure, he became
agitated and confused.  It was unclear initially if this was
due to the medication effect or his underlying medical
issues.  The patient required p.r.n. Haldol for sedation as
well as a one-to-one sitter which he still requires.  His
attention has waxed and waned consistent with delirium from a
toxic metabolic encephalopathy.

6.  Swallowing;  The patient has been noted by Nursing to
have difficulty swallowing where he chokes and turns" purple.
His sister noted some difficulty eating at home but not to
this extent.  It is unclear if this is due to his confusion
or if he has underlying mechanical problem.  This will need
to be explored by Speech and Swallow.





The rest of this dictation will be completed at a later
point.
