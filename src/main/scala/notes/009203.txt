Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis in setting of
radiation treatment.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80-year-old man with a history of DM II, HTN, AS
(valve area 1.1), medium-[**First Name3 (LF) 12425**] vasculitis and seronegative
arthritis (on prednisone and hydroxy-chloroquine),
3-[**First Name3 (LF) 12425**]-disease (LM 70%, Mid LAD 60%, Ramus mild disease, OM1
100%, Distal RCA 100%.) awaiting CABG, and atypical
fibroxanthoma of the nose requiring radiation who presents to ED
with chest pain, shortness of breath, and vomiting during
radiation treatment.  Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] was subsequently transferred
to the MICU with low BP, melena, Hct drop, ST depressions in
V3-V6, and elevated troponin.  In ED, CXR showed new mild
pulmonary edema, moderate right pleural effusion, mild
cardiomegaly, L>R bibasilar atelectasis.
.
Cardiology consult in the ICU concluded that elevated troponins
were likely reflective of demand ischemia/NSTEMI rather than
plaque rupture.  Cardiac symptoms occurred in setting of
pulmonary edema and anemia, putting added strain on an already
diseased heart.  Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] could not be started on a heparin
drip due to nasal bleeding and melena.
.
Patient was transfused 3 units of blood in the ICU and responded
appropriately (went from 23.9-->29).  It was thought that anemia
was most likely the result of a slow nasal bleed rather than an
acute GI bleed.  Although held initially in light of bleed and
low BP, patient was eventually continued on ASA, statin, plavix,
BB, and [**Last Name (un) **].
.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient was in good spirits.  His
cardiac enzymes were trending down and EKG changes were
resolving.  Vitals on transfer were: T: 98.7, HR: 64, BP:
126/55, 94% on RA.
.
ROS:  Patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, headache,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills or any other
concerning symptom.

[**2163-4-1**]:
Interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
effusions.  The study and the report were reviewed by the staff
radiologist.

CTA:
1. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta,
iliac
vessels, and throughout both lower extremities, as outlined
above.
2. No vascular wall thickening or perivascular edema to suggest
vasculitis.  No central arterial thrombi.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Note is made of non-specific focal loss of the normal
fasciculation of the left sciatic nerve in the distal thigh.
Correlation with symptoms is
suggested.
.
CAROTID ULTRASOUND [**4-12**]:
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA no stenosis.
.
ECHO [**4-13**]:
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems
including 3-[**Name2 (NI) 12425**] CAD awaiting CABG, bleeding nasal tumor, and
DM II who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for demand ischemia vs. NSTEMI
in the setting of low hematocrit and hypotension.
.
#CAD:  Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] has severe 3-[**Known lastname 12425**] disease and is awaiting
CABG (and AVR) however, surgery has been delayed in light of
bleeding nasal tumor.  Patient will need to be on high doses of
heparin during bypass, thus it is imperative to wait until tumor
has shrunk and is less likely to bleed.  Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] was
admitted to the hospital after complaining of chest pain, SOB,
and diaphoresis during a radiation treatment.  He was found to
have ST depressions in V3-V6, elevated troponins, drop in hct,
and low BP.  It was felt that this was demand ischemia in
context of anemia (slowly bleeding nasal tumor).  He was
admitted to the MICU and transfused 3 units of blood (hct bumped
appropriately).  After transfer to the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] was
continued on ASA 325mg, high dose statin, and valsartan.  His
metoprolol was switched to carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] for better blood
pressure control.  Plavix was stopped in light of bleeding and
in preparation for CABG.  Patient remained chest pain free
throughout duration of admission.  He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-28**] for CABG evaluation and will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] for
outpatient cardiology management.
