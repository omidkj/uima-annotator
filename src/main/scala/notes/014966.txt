Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 37 year old man without significant past medical
history who presents with fever, hypotension, right lower lobe
pneumonia on chest x-ray, now called out of ICU to regular
medical floor.
Patient initially presented with worsening URI symptoms,
fatigue, malaise, cough, fevers/chills, orthostasis, pleuritic
chest pain.  In ED, was febrile, borderline tachycardic, low
blood pressures (SBP low 90's from baseline of low 100's),
lactate 2.6, WBC 25.9.  Chest x-ray demonstrated RLL pneumonia.
Patient was administered 4 liters of NS and admitted to the
intensive care unit.
In the intensive care unit, patient was continued on IV fluid
repletion with resolution of his elevated lactate and
hypotension to baseline BPs.  He was initially started on
Vancomycin, CTX, levofloxacin and transitioned to Vanc, CTX,
azithromycin.  His oxygenation has remained stable in the high
90's on 3L NC.  His WBC has come down to 18.6.  Urine legionella
was sent and is negative.  Blood cultures are no growth to date,
sputum culture contaminated, respiratory viral screen (including
influenza) is preliminarily negative, MRSA screen pending.  LFTs
(including LDH) are within normal limits.
Of note, patient is also noted to have new anemia with Hct 30 ->
26 on admission, decreased from last level of 40 1 year ago (per
discussion wit PCP), with MCV of 70.  Iron studies demonstrate
iron deficiency anemia.  Patient has been started on iron
supplements.  When questioned about this, patient denies any
melena, BRBPR.  Does state that in [**Month (only) 404**] underwent surgery for
deviated septum, and after this surgery had "horrible" bloody
noses for 1 week, with a lot of associated blood loss.
Also of note, patient is noted to have elevated INR of 2.1.
Liver enzymes WNL, DIC labs pending.
Currently pt states he feels better than on admission, but
remains slightly achy, getting a fever again currently,
continued cough which is spastic.  Pleuritic chest pain
improved.

Hazy airspace consolidation in lower right lung, without
obscuration of right hemidiaphragm or right heart border, more
conspicuous than 7 hours prior, likely due to interval
hydration, and again consistent with posterior RLL pneumonia. No
other newly apparent consolidation.

There is mild cardiomegaly. There is new mild pulmonary edema.
Known right lower lobe pneumonia is obscured by the new
pulmonary abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
37 year old man without significant past medical history who
presents with fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated lactate
and right lower lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray, consistent with
sepsis.
.
# Pneumonia/sepsis:  Patient presented with fever, hypoxia,
leukocytosis, elevated lactate, evidence of right lower lobe
pneumonia on chest x-ray.
Was initially admitted to the intensive care unit where he
underwent aggressive volume hydration, was placed on vancomycin,
ceftriaxone and azithromycine.  Urine legionella was negative,
Influenza screen was negative, sputum culture was attempted but
was cancelled as was contaminated with oropharyngeal flora.  The
patient had no HIV risk factors and LDH was normal, making PCP
pneumonia less likely.
With above measures, patient stabilized with resolution of his
hypotension and elevated lactate, WBC trended down, oxygenation
improved and he was transferred to the regular medical floor.
After transfer, the patient was transitioned from vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, azithromycin to levofloxacin.  He was weaned off of
oxygen completely, but remained with dyspnea on exertion and an
ambulatory O2 saturdation was in the high 80's.  His exam and
chest x-ray were consistent with continued right lower lobe
pneumonia as well as small amount of volume overload, felt to be
due to his aggressive IV fluid hydration on presentation.  We
therefore administerd 1 dose of lasix to assist with diuresis.
With above measures, patient improved and was discharged home to
complete a 14 day course of antibiotics, with outpatient follow
up with his primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] note, patient was still having fevers at time of discharge,
but remainder of clinical indicators were improved (including
oxygenation, blood pressure, heart rate, decreased WBC), so felt
he was safe for discharge with close follow up with his primary
care physician.
.
# Leukocytosis:  Presumably due to presenting pneumonia as
above.  Trending down on discharge.
.
# Iron deficiency anemia:  Last Hct = 40 in [**5-2**], on
presentation Hct was 30, low MCV of 68-70, iron studies were
consistent with iron deficiency anemia.  Hemolysis labs were
negative, B12 and folate were normal.  Guiac negative on exam.
In discussion with patient regarding this new anemia, he
described 1 week of p
