CXR:
There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with
associated compression atelectasis of the right middle lobe.
Cardiomegaly is unchanged. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion
is seen. There is mild vascular fullness, but no definite
evidence of CHF. Midline sternotomy wires and staples indicate
prior CABG. A new left-sided IJ catheter is in place, without
pneumothorax. Right-sided AICD remains in place.
.
Head CT:
This examination is slightly limited by patient motion. There is
no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles and sulci
are mildly prominent, consistent with mild atrophy. The
differentiation of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter is preserved. There
is no evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Bone windows show clear paranasal sinuses with no evidence of
fracture. No significant soft tissue swelling is seen.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe regional systolic dysfunction.
The inferolateral wall and inferior walls are akinetic. The
distal half of the lateral and anterior walls are hypokinetic.
The basal half of the septum contracts best. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with prominent free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.  EJECTION FRACTION: 20%


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58 M with long cardiac hx here w/ ms changes, hypercarbia
and increased VT

1. MS changes: Given pt's waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, a
head CT was done and ruled out bleed and urine and blood tox
labs were sent and all returned negative.  TSH, B12 and Folate
were also all within normal limits.  Differential diagnosis also
included infection, though there was no clear source,
hypercarbia and overmedication with percocet.  Etiology was
likely hypercarbia and by hospital day #[**1-4**], his mental status
had improved.  On day of discharge, pt was back to his baseline.

.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt was initially admitted to
the ICU for BiPAP to lower pCO2 and he was transferred to the
floor after his mental status improved.  Respiratory failure was
likely multifactorial, due to combination of COPD with recent
URI, overuse of narcotics and not using CPAP while at home.  He
was initally given IV solumedrol for his COPD exacerbation and
then transitioned to po steroids. His bronchitis was trated with
a 5-day course of azithromycin.  Pt with chronic respiratory
acidosis with baseline pCO2 likely in the 60s-70s.  Once
transferred out of the ICU, pt remained stable on home dose of
oxygen, 3-4L.  Serial ABGs showed a persistently high pCO2 in
the 70s while the pt remained asx.  He was continued on CPAP at
night for his OSA.
.
3. VT s/p AICD placement: Pt had frequent episodes of NSVT and
longer runs requiring ATP.  He was seen by EP and started on an
amiodarone drip given concerns regarding frequency of episodes.
After marked decrease in NSVT, he was returned to his outpt
amiodarone dose of 200mg qd.  Patient may need VT ablation as an
outpatient given the fact that he is young and should not be on
amiodarone for long term management.
.
4. CHF: On admission, pt appeared dry and his lasxi and ACE-I
were held.  An echocardiogram during admission showed severely
depressed systolic function with an EF of 20%.  His medications
were restarted later during his hospital stay when he became
euvolemic and he was continued on Lasix (decreased from his
regular home dose), ACE-I and toprol.  His zaroxylyn was held
due to his hypovolemic status on admission.
.
5. CAD: Given his NSVT, cardiac enzymes were checked to rule out
coronary causes.  These were negative.  He was continued on asa,
statin, BB, plavix.
.
6. ARF: On admission, creatinine elevated to 1.9 likely
secondary to hypovolemia.  A FeUrea was consistent with a
pre-renal picture so pt was given gentle IVF.  As his volume
status improved, his creatinine returned to his baseline of 1
