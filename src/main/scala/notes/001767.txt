Brief Hospital Course:
 50M with h/o OSA, COPD and chronic pain on narcotics, who was
admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

#. AMS: Patient presented with increased lethargy for week. He
was oriented on arrival to the MICU but was falling asleep
intermittently during the interview. Patient had been taking
seroquel 600 mg po qHS and xanax 4 mg po BID, oxycontin SR 100
mg po TID, oxycodone IR 10 mg po q3-4h which are likely
contributing to his AMS. He has not been taking risperdal.  Held
all pysch meds while lethargic discontinued seroquel. Decreased
xanax dose and continue lower dose seroquel once more awake.
Treated medical comorbities as below.  His AMS improved and he
was transferred to the floor.  His AMS was thought to be
multifactorial.  His BiPAP settings were adjusted, psych was
consulted and adjusted his medications to seroquel 300mg PO
daily, risperidone 3mg Daily and diazepam 1mg PO QID.  Pain was
also consulted and we were able to lower his pain regiment to
oxycontin 40mg PO Q8H and oxycodone 10mg PO Q6H:PRN and Topomax
25mg PO Daily.  We discussed with the patient and his mother the
fine balance needed between symptom control and maintaining his
normal mental state and respiratory integrity.  He will follow
up with psych in the outpatient setting for eventual weaning off
of the seroquel and diazepam.
.
#Shortness of breath:  likely multifactorial - obesity
hypoventilation, pulmonary HTN from OSA, COPD exacerbation, in
the setting of taking multiple sedating medications. Patient was
originally admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring
BiPAP in the ED. On arrival to the MICU, he was on 2 L NC and
while minimal shortness of breath and wheezing. He also also
evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR but no sign of pna.Continued
prednisone 60 mg po daily and azithromycin 250 mg po daily . He
was intubated for brief period of time and successfully
extubated. Continued home BIPAP at night and albuterol and
ipratroprium nebs. Home BiPAP settings are Nasal CPAP with PSV,
inspiratory pressure 18cm/H20, expiratory pressure 10 cm/H20,
supplemental oxygen 2-6 L/min to maintain SpO2 to >92%. He was
diuresed 6.4L and was satting well at his goal O2 of 88-92% on
RA at the time of transfer to the floor.  He remained stable on
the floor.
.
# Chronic pain: He has severe, debilitating chronic pain [**12-20**]
bilateral hip avascular necrosis. His home narcotics and benzos
were tapered and he was transferred to the floor with CIWA
protocol.  Psychiatry consulted and recommended continuation of
xanax during taper period with ativan for CIWA.  Pain service
was also consulted and recommended new regimen of standing
oxycontin 40mg PO Q8H with oxycodone 10mg Q6H:PRN as well as
Topomax 25mg Daily.  On this new regiment, we were able to
achieve his baseline pain of [**2-26**].  He was discharged on this
new regiment.
.
# schizophrenia: pt denied AH/VH. psych was consulted and
recommended starting risperidal alongside seroquel and slowly
tapering seroquel, because of its sedative effects.  He will
also continue diazepam 1mg QID for now with plan to taper off of
benzodiazepines in the future.
.
# Diabetes: Patient was continued on home insulin 70/30 [**Hospital1 **]
regiment with a sliding scale that was higher than normal
because he was on steroids during his stay for possible COPD
exacerbation.  His sugars were high while on the steroids, but
manageable with his ISS.  His metformin and glyburide were
restarted at the time of
