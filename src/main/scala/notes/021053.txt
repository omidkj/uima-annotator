Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Trach dislodgement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Replacement of trach

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58941**] is a 77 year-old male status post tracheostomy
[**2-/2112**] and PEG tube placement in [**8-/2112**], who presents from his
NH after dislodging his trach. Per EMS records, he was
saturating well on 100% NRB. A 3.5 cm ETT was positioned in
stoma prior to transfer.

In ED ([**8-1**]), T 96.7, HR 103, BP 111/69, RR 24, Sat 99% on NRB.
Tm 100.4 in ED. His tracheostomy (#6.0 Portex) was replaced with
fiberoptic bronchoscope (following stoma dilation). A CXR was
suspicious for a RLL pneumonia. While in the ED, he required
frequent toileting. For this reason, he was admitted to the ICU
for further care.


Past Medical History:
1. History of botulism toxin poisoning in [**2-/2112**]
2. Anoxic brain injury in setting of trach plugging
3. Status post tracheostomy 01/[**2112**]. Multiple ED visits for
trach replacement ([**2113-6-15**], [**2113-6-17**]).
4. Status post PEG tube placement [**8-/2112**]
5. Hypertension
6. Hypercholesterolemia, not on medication
7. BPH
8. Depression
9. History of MRSA in sputum (? at NH)

Radiology:

Chest AP [**2113-8-1**]-
The previously demonstrated tracheostomy has been dislodged in
the meantime interval. The upper trachea is slightly distorted
and tortuous. There is no overt pneumomediastinum.
The heart size is normal. Mediastinum has normal contours, width
and position. The right lower lobe consolidation is new. The
left lung is clear. The pleural surfaces are smooth with no
pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION:
1) Slightly irregular upper trachea after tracheostomy
dislodgement.
2) New right lower lobe consolidations represent pneumonia or
aspiration.
CT chest without contrast [**2113-8-2**]-
A tracheostomy was inserted in the interval, with a 2-2.5 cm
intratracheal length. The trachea and the right main and right
lower lobe bronchus contain a large volume of secretions with
subsequent partial atelectasis of right lower lobe. Lower lobe
bronchiectasis is greater on the right in an area of
consolidation that is likely due to atelectasis, but pneumonia
cannot be excluded. Recurrent aspiration is likely given diffuse
distension of the esophagus with air and fluid.

Multiple centrilobular nodules in the upper lobes are bilateral,
more on the right, representing bronchiolitis, could be due to
aspiration or [**Doctor First Name **] infection.

Pleural effusions demonstrated on the neck CT from [**2112-3-8**]
have resolved. Diffuse calcification of the left apical pleura
most probably represents previous granulomatous infection.

Several mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, most diffusely
calcified, up to 1 cm in subcarinal region, 2A:56.
Atherosclerotic calcification involves all major coronary
arteries. The heart size is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion. Pleural effusions demonstrated on the neck CT from
[**2112-3-8**] has been resolved.

Images of upper abdomen demonstrate percutaneous gastrostomy and
additional drainage for unknown purpose. The liver, the spleen,
the kidneys, the adrenals, and the pancreas are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Tracheostomy tube shorter than usually seen. No
complications.
2. Central airways secretions probably responsibe for right
lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Mild bibasilar bronchiectasis and upper lobe bronchiolitis
most probably due to recurrent aspiration, [**Doctor First Name **] infection cannot
be excluded.
4. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, partially calcified, and
calcified pleural plaque with bilateral apical scarring could
represent previous granulomatous exposure.
5. Full length esophageal dilatation, suggest distal obstruction
or dysfunction.
Chest AP [**2113-8-4**]-CHEST: AP portable upright view. The
tracheostomy tube appears small, given the caliber of the
trachea. Previously noted opacities in the right upper, left
upper, and right lower lobes are slightly improved. There is no
pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. Heart and mediastinum
appear normal.

IMPRESSION: Partial improvement in multifocal consolidations.
Chest AP [**2113-8-10**]. Improving right lower lobe and right upper lobe
consolidation. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
normal.

IMPRESSION: Improving right upper lobe and right lower lobe
consolidation. Tracheostomy in good position.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year-old male with tracheostomy and prior MRSA in sputum,
status post tracheostomy change in ED following accidental
removal, with increased secretions/low-grade fever and
bronchiectasis on repeat CT.

1. Respiratory decompensation/hypoxemia
Pt was admitted and had copious thick secretions. CT scan showed
evidence of bibasilar bronchiectasis and upper lobe
bronchiolitis most probably due to recurrent aspiration. He was
treated with an empiric nine day course of vancomycin and
levaquin though CXR looked wholely good.  He also had moderate
improvement in secretions with atrovent PO (not through trach)
but a return of variable secretions (often thick) in upper and
lower airways since then. We continued pulmonary toilet, and
supplemental O2 via trach mask as needed. The possibility of
decannulation was entertained but in reviewing records from both
[**Hospital **] rehabilitation and in speaking with son, it was deemed
that it was not plausible; this had been attempted in the past
though was unsuccessful secondary to copious amounts of
secretions.

We also considered placing a cuffed trach in this pt to help
prevent aspiration of secretions. However, pt would have to go
to OR as stoma is small and this was decided against. Sputum
recultured from [**2113-8-6**] is growing GNR, unspeciated at this
point. On [**2113-8-10**] pt was started on cefepime, which he will
continue for a 10 d
