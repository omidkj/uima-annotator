Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

History of Present Illness:
71 year old female, chronically trach'ed and vented, h/o
multiple hospitalizations since [**4-10**], h/o multiple psedomonal
PNAs, ARDS, COPD, chronic hypercarbia, presented to the ED after
being discharged from the ICU to rehab 2 days ago.
.
The patient has had extensive recent hospitalizations. Last hosp
was for 1 month from [**Month (only) **] to mid [**Month (only) **]. During the most recent
admission, she was tx'd for hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory
failure, recurrent multi-drug resistant pseudomonal pneumonia,
(for which she completed a 21 day course of meropenem, altered
mental status and rapid atrial fibrillation. When the patient
was discharged, she was stable on PSV 10/5 FIO2 0.4, pulling
normal tidal volumes. Although a chronic CO2 retained, pt left
the hospital in no respiratory distress.
.
Reportedly, last night, while on SIMV mode, the patient was
anxious, agitated, awake the whole night and was medicated with
ativan total of 1.5mg, and then fell asleep. Per rehab notes, at
7am, the patient was not arousable, and ABG done, pCO2 92 (80s
baseline) with O2 sats in the high 80s. Pt was switched back to
AC, given 80 IV lasix w/o improvement, pCO2 on re-check was 132.
Pt was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt's abg was 7.34/90/112. Her UA
was also + and Ucx was sent. The patient was admitted to the
MICU for lethargy, hypercarbic resp failure.


Past Medical History:
1. Influenza A in [**4-10**] complicated by ARDS eventually leading to
intubation, ventilatory support, and tracheostomy.

CXR: : Comparison is made to previous study from [**2130-9-29**].

The tracheostomy tube and left-sided central venous catheter are
unchanged in position and appropriately sited. There is
cardiomegaly, unchanged. There are again seen diffuse airspace
opacities throughout both lungs, which have worsened and have
more confluent opacification within the left mid-to-lower lung
field. There is a prominent retrocardiac opacity. There is also
increased density seen in the lung apices. This may represent
loculated fluid. The patient has severe scoliosis. These diffuse
airspace opacities are nonspecific and could be due to a
combination of extensive pulmonary edema versus
infectious/inflammatory process. Alveolar hemorrhage would also
have a similar appearance.

.
CT abd / pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. No evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
3. Continued pulmonary consolidations consistent with pneumonia.
4. Cholelithiasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
71F with chronic respiratory failure secondary to
influenza/ARDS, reccurent pseudomonal pneumonias, afib,
bronchiectasis admitted with changes in mental status and
hypercarbic respirator failure.

She placed back on AC ventilation, and was treated with steroids
and inhalers.  Her respiratory status was continuing to decline,
and she also developed acute renal failure (oliguric), as well
as thrombocytopenia and coagulaopathy.  Her BP was trending
downward, and she was requiring medications to maintain MAP of
55.  It was unclear the etiology of her thrombocytopenia, and
there was concoern for HIT or DIC.  There were multiple family
meetings with the MICU team, including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The decision
was made to make her comfort measures only, which was amenable
to the entire family.  She expired in the presence of her
family, peacefully, and in no apparent distress.  THe family
declined an autopsy.
