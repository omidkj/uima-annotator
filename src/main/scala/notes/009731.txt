Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70884**] is a 57 yo male with h/o MS who presented to OSH
today with respiratory distress. Per friend and notes patient
was fine last night. Today he was coughing for several hours and
at ~ 5 pm he was found vomiting, coughing and aspirating emesis.
He was SOB, RR was 36-40 and O2 sat was 84 % on RA.  He was
suctioned and treated with O2.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where HR was 160, BP 140/90,RR
36 and O2 sat was 84% on RA. He was given metronidazole,
levofloxacin and ativan. He was paralyzed (etomidate 20 mg IV,
succinyl choline 125 mg IV) and intubated. He was given fentanyl
50 IV x2. OG tube was placed and brownish material came back.
Peripheral neosynephrine was started after a failed line attempt
for systolics in the 80s. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further w/u.
.
In the ER here temp was 102, HR 150s (?afib), BP was in the 80s
systolic. Lactate was 7.4, WBC 1.3 with 58% bands. A central
line was placed and patient was started on levophed. His abdomen
appeared distended so abd/pelvis CT was done.  It showed
evidence of bowel obstruction.  Surgery was consulted and did
not see a need for surgical intervention.  Additionally CXR was
done and showed a multifocal pneumonia. CT c-spine did not show
an acute fracture.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: appears to be sinus tachycardia vs. aflutter at a rate of
153
ST, q waves in 2, 3
<[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V2-v3
.
CT head [**1-14**]:  No acute intracranial pathology including no
evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Mild-to-moderate amount of
chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic changes with mild
prominence of the ventricles and sulci.  Paranasal sinuses show
a minimal amount of mucosal thickening in the medial left
maxillary sinus and ethmoid air cells.
.
CXR [**1-14**]:  Bilateral asymmetric opacities representing either
multifocal pneumonia vs asymmetric pulmonary edema with
infection more likely given lack of widening of the vascular
pedicle.
.
Abd/pelvis CT [**1-14**]:
Bilateral parenchymal consolidations in both lower lobes
posteriorly, and there are multiple nodular densities in the
right middle lobe.
The abdomen contains multiple dilated small bowel loops with
air-fluid levels and a transition point in the right lower
quadrant, consistent with small bowel obstruction.  The colon is
relatively decompressed, containing residual air at several
locations.  There is no ascites or free intra-abdominal air.
.
C-spine film (prelim): Limited exam due to patient motion.  No
obvious fractures or malalignment.
.
RUQ U/S [**2130-1-20**]: No evidence for gallstones.  No son[**Name (NI) 493**]
signs of acute cholecystitis. Sludge within gallbladder.
.
.
speech and swallow evaluation [**2131-1-29**]:
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Advance diet to ground solids & thin liquids by single
    cup sip only, NO STRAWS!! No Mixed consistencies like
    cold cereal w/milk or chicken soup w/liquid and solids
    together.

2.  Medications crushed in puree

3.  Strict Aspiration Precautions:
    A.  PT MUST BE FED BY STAFF!
    B.  Remind him to eat & drink SLOWLY and
    C.  No Talking w/food/liquid in his mouth
    D.  Single cup sips of thin liquid, NO STRAWS
    E.  Hold liquid in mouth & keep head level
        (don't look up or throw head back when drinking)
    F.  Alternate between bites and sips

4.  If he coughs while drinking, downgrade his diet to Nectar-
    Thick liquids.  If he has any signs of coughing or choking
    on ground solids, downgrade to Pureed foods.  If he
    does well w/ground solids, consider upgrading to soft
    solids while carefully alternating between bites and sips

5.  Repeat the videoswallow if his mental status or medical
    status worsens to be sure this diet is still safe

PROGNOSIS:
Prognosis for safe swallowing without aspiration is good if he
is
supervised to take single sips of liquid and alternate between
bites and sips.  However, if he drinks from a straw or feeds
himself, he tends to "gulp & shovel" liquid/food into his mouth,
placing him at significant risk to aspirate.  Also, his level of
alertness/attention vary throughout the day.  Please don't feed
him when he is not alert, attentive and appropirately following
commands.

[**2131-1-29**]: TTE with bubble study:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen  ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good  leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 yo male with h/o MS who presents with hypoxia,
hypotension, neutropenia, fevers, ileus with likely PNA and UTI,
intubated for respiratory failure & sepsis.
.
# pulmonary: On arrival to the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 70884**] was hypoxic,
hypotensive, neutropenic, febrile and was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure.  Source of his respiratory failure was
likely aspiration in the setting of sepsis.  He was initially
treated with treated with meropenem x 7 days given concern for
aspiration pneumonia in this man who is chronic resident of an
extended care facility.  A BAL was performed which showed 1+ gm
pos cocci in pairs and negative cultures.  On [**1-19**], a SBT was
performed and patient was successfully extubated.  Following
extubation, he continued to have copious secretions with
diminished gag, requiring vigorous chest PT.  On [**1-23**], CXR
appeared markedly worsened consolidation representing
aspiration.  Patient has weak gag and is not completely clearing
copious secretions.  Due to leukocytosis, ? consolidation, pt
was started on Zosyn as empiric therapy for hospital acquired vs
recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
.
Pt was called out to medical floor on [**2131-1-28**].  A CTA was
obtained [**2-9**] persistent tachycardia and oxygen requirement
(2-3L), which revealed bilateral PE.  Pt was started on heparin,
then transitioned to lovenox and coumadin.  He was weaned off of
oxygen, and breathing comfortably on RA on [**1-29**].  Pt discharged
on [**1-31**] with instructions to continue coumadin, and lovenox
injections twice daily, and to have daily INRs checked and faxed
to his PCP ([**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) **], fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 70885**]) with
goal INR [**2-10**].  He may discontinue his lovenox injections once
his INR is therapeutic (INR [**2-10**]) or as instructed by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] his pneumonia, pt will complete a 14 day course of
zosyn and vancomycin (via PICC) for hospital acquired pneumonia
(day 1 [**2131-1-23**], last day [**2131-2-5**]).  Pt may benefit from ongoing
chest PT to help mobilize his secretions.
