Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
57yo M w/ PMH of poorly controlled DM type II, cirrhosis, HCV,
HTN, and a h/o TB who presents with hypoxic respiratory failure
requiring intubation in the ER. He presented to the ER on [**9-26**]
with SOB x 1 week that became progressively worse, culminating
in CP on deep inspiration. VS on arrival were T 99.2, HR 82, BP
145/60 and sats of 60% on RA -> 90% on NRB. Per the ED records,
a CXR was obtained and revealed white out of his R lung. ABG was
significant for 7.5/29/48/23. Findings were discussed with the
patient who agreed with intubation. He was intubated w/o event,
using succinylcholine and etomidate. A prpofol gtt was started
for sedation, but the patient also required 9mg of versed for
adequate sedation and 50mcg fentanyl for pain. BP was then noted
to dip to 78, likely due to propofol bolus. He was given an IVF
bolus w/ improvement in his SBP to 106. He required an
additional 10mg versed and 100mcg fentanyl for sedation/pain. A
central line was placed for access and labs were sent off. His
BP remained in the range of 89-142/42-71, with HR in the range
of 82-91. Once he was hemodynamically stable, he was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.

.
[**10-12**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Agitated saline
contrast study suggests the presence of an intracardiac shunt
(probably stretched patent foramen ovale or atrial septal
defect). Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**10-13**] Sputum gram stain: yeast ([**Female First Name (un) **]), mold
[**10-16**] CT:
1. Interval worsening of airspace consolidation and mild ground
glass changes with prominent consolidation at the bases
bilaterally. The differential includes ARDS and multifocal
pneumonia.
2. Development of mediastinal air most likely secondary to
barotrauma related to ventilation.
3. Shaggy irregular wall thickening of descending and sigmoid
colon. The appearance seems to suggest a possible underlying C.
diff colitis, however, in the presence of ascites this may be
related to a low-protein state.
4. Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.
.
[**10-17**] CXR: Widespread pulmonary consolidation predominantly
bibasilar has worsened appreciably between [**10-13**] and
[**10-16**]. Worsening opacification since [**10-16**]
probably represents an overlay of mild pulmonary edema. There
may be small bilateral pleural effusion as well. Heart size is
top normal. ET tube in standard placement. Tip of the right
jugular line projects over the SVC. Nasogastric tube passes into
the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Goals of Care: Initially Full code, but as disease progressed
family made patient CMO.
.
2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE/ARDS: Patient presented with fluminant
bilateral patchy pneumonia and intubated in the ED. It
progressed to ARDS. It was complicated by a GNR VAP.  He later
developed fungemia.  His respiratory status continued to decline
and it became impossible to oxygenate him on maximal therapy.
.
3) PNEUMONIA: Initially thought of as CAP/hospital acquired/asp
and treated with azithro/ceftaz/vanco/flagyl changed to
zosyn/flagyl/vanco. Then grew GNR in sputum and thought to have
VAP and started on meropenum. Pt now growing yeast in blood
cultures, may also be the cause of his pneumonia. Caspofungin
was started [**10-11**] and changed to fluconazole on [**10-12**].
.
4) HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Had two discrete episodes of hypotension
in conjunction with episodes of sepsis.
.
5) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Patient had 2 episodes of ARF that both
resolved in setting of underperfusion and sepsis.
.
6) ANEMIA: Has a chronic anemia, but baseline is usually low to
mid 30's.  He was transfused as necessary.
.
7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Likely due to splenic
sequestration/splenomegaly from his cirrhosis. Also a chronic
problem, with baseline plts in the 80-100 range. They were
monitored and he never required transfusion.
.
8) COAGULOPATHY: Pt has poor synthetic liver function and he was
given FFP for procedures.
.
9) DM TYPE II: He was treated with Insulin drip, NPH and RISS as
needed throughout hospitalization.
.
10) HEP C/CIRRHOSIS: Had h/o hep C genotype Ib, but not on
treatment. Was on liver transplant list at one point. LFT's were
mildly elevated.  At times was on propranolol for esophageal
varices. Pantoprazole given for esophageal varices.  Lactulose
for bowel regimen
.
11) elevated pancreatic enzymes: occured late during
hospitalization.  No pain associated.
.
12) HTN: Had history of htn at home occasionally required
hydralazine.
.
13) FEN: He received tube feeds while intubated.
