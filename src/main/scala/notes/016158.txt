History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 98099**] is a 72 y/o female limited stage SCLC, s/p four
cycles of cisplatin and etoposide with concomitant external beam
radiation who presented to [**Hospital **] hospital with 3-4 day h/o
cough and congestion. Chest xray showed "white out" and she was
intubated for respiratory distress with
etomidate/succinylcholine. She received vancomycin, zosyn, and
solumedrol. R-IJ placed at OSH. Her normal care is at [**Last Name (un) 4068**].
She has completed therapy over three and a half years ago and
has had no evidence of disease recurrence. She continues to see
pulmonary regarding her reactive airway disease and eosinophilic
pneumonia. Other chronic physical complaints include intention
tremor with her right hand, and proximal muscle weakness
impeding body position changes. Was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] in
[**6-/2159**] and treated for CAP.
.
In the ED admission vitals: 92 99/69 18 97% on ventilator. She
arrived intubated on a fentanyl and midazolam gtt. She received
300cc in the ED and 1L at the OSH. Most Recent Vitals: 90,
88/49, 16, 96% on vent settings: 400, 16, 5 PEEP, 50% fiO2.
.
On the floor, patient was intubated and accopmpanied by her
husband and daughter.

Past Medical History:
IPMT (intraductal papillary mucinous tumor)
chronic eosinophilic pneumonia:no prior pulm notes in our
system; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
Pulmonary HTN
gastritis
depression
herpes zoster
s/p appy
s/p cholecystectomy
.
Past Oncologic History per oncology notes: SCLC- routine MRCP
performed in follow up of her IPMT on [**2155-3-19**], which
showed a possible right posterior rib lesion. She had a chest CT
performed on
[**2155-4-23**], which showed a 2.7 x 1.7 cm soft tissue density that

extended to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. This

corresponded to the abnormality seen on the MRCP. In addition,
there were lymph nodes noted in the prevascular, peritracheal,
subcarinal, and mediastinal stationed in the right hilum.
FDG/PET
imaging showed intensely FDG avid dominant right lung nodule and

intensely FDG avid right hilar, right peritracheal, and
precarinal lymph nodes. She underwent mediastinoscopy and lymph

node biopsy showed small cell lung cancer. She was staged as
limited stage and has since completed four cycles of cisplatin
and etoposide with concomitant XRT in addition to prophylactic
cranial irradiation (PCI), completing on [**2155-10-10**].


Social History:
Lives with husband. Formerly employed in formulating specs for
valve company. Quit smoking 45 years ago. Smoked 2ppd x 10
years. Denies IVDU. Has children who are healthy.


Family History:
3 brothers with CAD s/p stents palced in 60s-70s. Father died in
his 90s of "old age". has one brother with DM. Mother died of
heart problems in her 60s. No FH lung disease or other
malignancy.

Pertinent Results:
Radiology
.
EKG [**9-26**]
Ectopic atrial rhythm is new as compared with previous tracing
of [**2158-7-7**].
Prior inferior myocardial infarction. Low precordial lead
voltage. There is continued slight ST segment elevation in leads
II, III and aVF and resolution of the previously recorded ST
segment elevation in leads I and aVL. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
.
CXR [**9-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Lines and tubes as described above.
2. Diffuse airspace opacities, likely reflecting components of
pneumonia and pulmonary edema
.
BAL brushings-
DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial lavage:
ATYPICAL. Atypical single cells and dark groups of crushed
material,
  cannot further characterize
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2159-9-30**] 11:52 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Right upper lobe radiation fibrosis with worsening adjacent
consolidation as well as increased left lung consolidation,
worrisome for superimposed infection. Thickened septal lines and
ground-glass opacity, particularly in the left lung, could
indicate additional pulmonary edema. Trace bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. 16-mm left thyroid nodule is unchanged since [**2158**] and can be
further
evaluated with ultrasound if not previously performed.
.
CXR [**10-7**]-IMPRESSION: Increasing density over left lower lobe
suggesting worsening pneumonia.
.
[**10-8**] head CT-IMPRESSION:
1. Parenchymal atrophy and sequela of small vessel microvascular
infarction with no acute intracranial findings.
2. Fluid within the left mastoid tip.
.
[**10-8**] CT chest-IMPRESSION: No relevant change in extent and
severity of the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal changes,
including the relative extensive right upper lobe opacity and
bilateral basal, right more than left, fibrosis. Near complete
resolution of a pre-existing small right pleural effusion. No
changes in the mediastinum.
.
ECHO [**10-9**]-The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary artery hypertension. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-7-6**],
the findings are similar.
.
MRI [**10-11**]-Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
1. No evidence of acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage or
space-occupying lesion.
2. Unchanged periventricular T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in
bilateral
cerebral hemispheres and pons, which likely represent
treatment-related
changes after prior whole brain radiation.
