Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization and stent placement
Temporary pacing wire placed immediately after catheterization,
removed within 24 hours.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 yo man with CAD s/p 3V CABG in [**2-27**], PVD, ESRD on
HD, DM who presented for left sided chest pain, [**6-5**], sharp in
nature without radiation, associated w/SOB and N/Vomiting x 1,
+visual changes "blurry" started at 10PM last night, waking him
from sleep and was ongoing. He reported this as different from
his typical anginal pain in that it was very sharp and localized
as opposed to diffuse pressure. He took nitroglycerin x 2 w/o
relief. He noted that he had been chest pain free since his
recent hospital discharge [**2129-9-2**] and noted that he has been
otherwise well. Of note, during that hospitalization he was
found to have patent stents and had a LM/LCx cypher stent
placed. Pt reports vigilantly taking all of his post discharge
medications, including his ASA and plavix. His usual angina he
describes as a "squeeze" brought on by exertion, and he
experiences angina walking up hills and 1 flight of stairs.
.
In the ED, the patient had EKG w/ST changes in V1 and V2 stable
on serial EKGs, Cardiology was consulted and recommended
starting heparin IV. Pt was started on Nitroglycerin gtt and
received Morphine Sulfate 4mg as well as ASA. Pt's pain
decreased to [**2-5**] after morphine.
.
He denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He also denied recent fevers, chills or rigors. He did
report exertional calf pain. All of the other review of systems
were negative.
Cardiac review of systems [**Last Name (un) **] notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. He did report chest pain with exertion as above.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:
[**2129-9-25**] (admission ECG): "Sinus rhythm. Diffuse non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the prior tracing there is no
significant change."
.
[**2129-9-26**] (on transfer to CCU post-catheterization): EKG
demonstrated sinus bradycardia with PR prolongation, occasional
dropped beats and intermittent pacing. long QT interval,
inverted T-waves in leads I, aVL, V5-V6, and peaked T-waves in
the precordial leads V1, V2. Incomplete right bundle branch
block.
.
TTE ([**2129-9-26**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**9-2**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed
three-vessel disease:
--The LMCA had a distal taper with 60% stenosis and modest
calcification.
--The LAD had proximal calcification with competitive flow
distally.
--The LCx was a non-dominant vessel with a proximal 80% stenosis
and
modest calcification.
--The RCA was a dominant vessel that was occluded proximally.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA to be widely
patent.
The SVG-OM1 and SVG-RPDA grafts were widely patent.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left-sided filling
pressures
with LVEDP of 12 mmHg. Systemic arterial systolic and [**Month/Year (2) 7216**]
pressures were normal. Upon pullback of the angled pigtail
catheter
from left ventricle to aorta, no gradient was observed across
the aortic
valve.
4. Successful stenting of the protected LM/LCx lesion with a
2.5x13
mm cypher stent which was postdilated to 2.75mm. Final
angiography
revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection
and TIMI 3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Summary:Successful stenting of the LM/LCx lesion.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**9-26**], with LAD stenting and D1 POBA. No
right heart catheterization.
.
CT scan [**9-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and other
abdominal vessels.
3. Aortobi-iliac stent graft.
4. Cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 7203**] is a 59 yo man with CAD s/p 3V CABG in [**2-27**], PVD,
ESRD on HD, DM who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for chest pain and EKG
changes.
.
#) CAD with unstable angina: EKG showed findings potentially
consistent with inferior wall ischemia. His first set of
troponins was slightly elevated from baseline. His chest pain
improved incompletely on nitroglycerin drip. Given the EKG
changes and persistent CP, heparin drip was started. His
nitroglycerin drip was stopped for hemodialysis. His isosorbide
mononitrate was increased to 120 mg daily with blood pressure
paramaters. We continued atorvastatin, labetalol and full dose
aspirin. We added norvasc. He was taken to the cath lab on [**9-26**],
where he had a LAD stent and D1 rescue as noted above, but after
which he had bradycardia and hypotension, unresponsive to
atropine. He had temporary pacing wires placed and was placed on
dopamine and transferred to the CCU. He soon stabilized there,
and was transferred back to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service the next day
