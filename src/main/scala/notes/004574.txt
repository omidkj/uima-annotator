Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Seventy-eight-year-old male with
COPD, PVD, coronary artery disease, AS, who was admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**10-1**] through [**10-2**] with chest tightness.  The cath
showed 60% mid LAD, 60% D1, and severe aortic stenosis.  He
had a CABG [**10-5**] with LIMA to LAD and reversed saphenous vein
graft to diagonal and AVR with porcine valve.  Discharged
[**10-12**] to rehab.  Presented to outside hospital on [**10-16**] in
AFib with RVR and was converted to normal sinus rhythm with
diltiazem.

Echo done at that time revealed EF 70%, no wall motion
abnormalities, small pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Questionable nonspecific EKG changes.  Had dobutamine stress
echo which showed mild inferior ischemia.  Patient was
asymptomatic and decision was made to continue his medical
treatment.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2195-10-22**] for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Steroid dependent COPD.
2.  PVD with claudication.
3.  CAD status post CABG and AVR.
4.  Anemia.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Lasix 20 [**Hospital1 **].
2.  Colace.
3.  Aspirin 325.
4.  Combivent.
5.  Paxil 20 q. day.
6.  Advair.
7.  Percocet.
8.  Captopril 6.25 t.i.d.
9.  Prednisone 20 b.i.d.
10. Digoxin 0.125 q. day.
11. Plavix.
12. Cardizem CD 240 mg q. day.
13. Coumadin 5 mg q. day.
14. Feosol 300 b.i.d.
15. Zithromax 250 q. day.
16. MDI Singulair.
17. Heparin drip.
18. Diltiazem drip 6 mg per hour.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, reaction unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with wife.  Greater than 80 pack
years, quit 15 years ago.  Occasional alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.7 F; BP 100/48; heart
rate 72; respiratory rate 20; sating 94% on two liters.
General:  He was comfortable, in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Anicteric, clear OP.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, 2-3/6 systolic
murmur heard throughout the precordium, loudest at the apex,
sternotomy scar healing well.  Abdomen:  Benign.
Extremities:  No edema, incision in left lower extremity
healing well.  Neuro:  Alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII intact.

LABORATORY:  CBC 11.3/30.0/427.  BUN and creatinine 37 and
0.8.  INR of 1.2.  Cardiac enzymes negative.

Chest x-ray no edema, decreased left pleural effusion, stable
right effusion, question right atelectasis versus infiltrate.

EKG normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, LVH, T wave inversion
in I, aVL, V4-V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  AFib.  The patient remained in sinus rhythm with good
rate control throughout his stay.  He was weaned off the
diltiazem drip without incident and converted to stable
outpatient regimen, which included metoprolol for rate
control.

2.  Coronary artery disease.  The patient remained chest pain
free throughout admission.  There was a question, report of
inferior ischemia by dobutamine echo at outside hospital.
However, given negative cardiac enzymes, lack of RCA disease
on recent cath, it was felt that there was no sufficient
reason to suspect ischemic etiology for causing patient's
AFib.

3.  COPD.  Patient's prednisone was tapered back to his home
regimen of 5 mg q. day and he was continued on his home MDIs.
His albuterol was changed to p.r.n. to avoid beta agonists in
the face of his AFib.

4.  Patient was discharged home in stable condition.  INR at
time of discharge was 2.0.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft and aortic valve replacement.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Paxil 20 mg q. day.
2.  Singulair 10 mg q. day.
3.  Iron 150 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Advair two puffs b.i.d.
5.  Atrovent two puffs q.i.d.
6.  Prednisone 5 mg q. day.
7.  Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.
8.  Lipitor 10 mg q. h.s.
9.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
10. Albuterol two puffs q. four hours prn.
11. Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q. day.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient was instructed to call his PCP for
close follow up of his PT INR after discharge.  Patient also
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1270**] in two weeks.  Patient was
also discharged home with VNA for INR checks, medication
teaching and post CABG wound and wound care, as well as home
PT and outpatient cardiac rehab.
