History of Present Illness:
Briefly, 59 year old female with CAD s/p PCI stent x 2 in [**2149**]
and diastolic CHF, mechanical valve replacement and paroxysmal
atrial tachycardia admitted on [**2156-5-16**] for EP ablation. She was
admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service for heparin bridge and coumadin
held in anticipation of procedure. She got the EP procedure
today and her atrial tachycardia was ablated. After the
procedure, she developed junctional bradycardia to the 50's. She
was reportedly given atropine without effect. She maintained her
BP's in the 80's to 90's. Then her bradycardia evolved to a
accelerated junctional escape to 80's. The cardiology fellow on
call did a bedside echo that did not show tamponade. She is
transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.
.
Currently, she feels tired but does not have any specific
complaints. +LH, denies CP, SOB, palpiations.

Echo [**5-18**]:
The right atrium is dilated. The left ventricle is not well
seen. Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be
reliably assessed. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. A mitral valve prosthesis is
present. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to poor echo windows and focused
views. There is no pericardial effusion. The right atrium
appears dilated. The right ventricle may also be dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is not well
visualized but is probably normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-4-21**],
the limited findings on the current study appear similar.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-5-18**] 10:49 PM
ADDENDUM:
Partially imaged sclerotic focus in proximal left humerus is
noted with apparent chondroid matrix. In the absence of
localized symptoms, this is most likely an enchondroma and less
likely a bone infarct. However, if there are symptoms in this
region, dedicated humeral radiographs would be recommended for
initial further assessment as communicated by phone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
by phone on [**2156-5-19**].
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, and lungs and pleural
surfaces remain clear.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-5-19**] 7:22 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-20**] and [**2156-5-18**]:
The lungs are clear. Patient has had median sternotomy. Heart is
overall top normal in size but both atria and possibly the right
ventricle are markedly dilated though unchanged since at least

.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-5-22**] 7:52 AM
CHEST: A dual-chamber pacemaker is present with leads in
satisfactory position. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
The lung fields are clear. The cardiac size is within normal
limits. Previous CABG noted.
IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax, pacemaker lines in good position.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN [**2156-5-23**]:
Patient is a 59 year old female with CAD s/p stenting x2, and
mechanical mitral valve replacement [**2-28**] rheumatic fever and
known paroxysmal atrial flutter admitted for elective atrial
tachycardia ablation complicated by post-procedural junctional
bradycardia and hypotension, s/p pacer placement.

# Rhythm: The patient was admitted s/p atrial tachycardia
ablation. Post-procedure, she had bradycardia and hypotension.
She had a junctional rhythm in the 40's. Initially, she received
no ionotropes and was monitored on telemetry. The following day,
her sinus node had not yet recovered; she remained bradycardiac
and hypotensive and she was then started on dopamine. Beta
blockers, lasix, spironolactone and losartan were held. The
dopamine was weaned as her blood
