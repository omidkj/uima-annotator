Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Dynamic
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Increased IVC
diameter (>2.1cm) with <35% decrease during respiration
(estimated RA pressure (10-20mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic
function. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No
MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CT head [**2137-4-29**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Right proximal clavicular fracture.
2. Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine. Please
note that
MRI is more sensitive in the detection of cord abnormalities.
3. Punctate hyperdense focus in the left temporal lobe which may
represent
hemmorhage or calcification.

CTA Chest [**2137-5-1**]

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in hemoperitoneum, centered in the right
paracolic
gutter, without evidence of active extravasation at the time of
the CT scan.

2. Multiple bilateral rib fractures, transverse processes
fractures, pelvic and sacral fractures, right clavicle fracture
and comminuted right humeral head fractures as described above.

3. Interval increase in presacral hematoma without definite
evidence of
active extravasation at the time of the scan.

4. Right adrenal gland hematoma.

5. Antral gastric wall thickening less pronounced on the current
study.

6. No evidence of pneumothorax. Increasing right greater than
left simple
pleural effusions with resultant atelectasis.

7. Noncalcified pulmonary nodules, followup chest CT to document
resolution or stability remains recommended in [**7-19**] months as
suggested before.


Chest PA/lat 3/
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-30**] through 28:

Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left,
stable since
[**5-3**]. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
unchanged.
Pulmonary vasculature is engorged but there is no good evidence
of edema.
Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax.









Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery,
Orthopedics, Plastics and Cardiology were all consulted. She was
taken to the Trauma ICU once initial trauma resuscitation was
performed. She was noted with dropping hematocrits and required
several PRBC transfusions; the initial concern was that there
may be a retroperitoneal bleed given right adrenal gland
hematoma with small amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage noted
on CT imaging. Her hematocrit during the remainder of her
hopsital course have ranged between 29-32 with 32 most recent on
[**2137-5-6**].

Neurosurgery consulted for a questionable subarachnoid
hemorrhage; it was instead noted to be a hyperdensity in left
temporal region and no neurosurgical intervention was warranted.


Orthopedics was consulted for her multiple orthopedic injuries;
these were managed non operatively. She was made non weight
bearing for her right clavicle fracture and weight bearing as
tolerated for her pelvic fractures.

Plastics was consulted for her acute right long trigger finger;
no operative intervention was warranted at the time. She will
