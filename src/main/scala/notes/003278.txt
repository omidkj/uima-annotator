Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Nsaids

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6994**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Triple lumen placed on [**2175-1-31**].
-Intubation.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 82 year old female with ESRD on hemodialysis MWF,
mild dementia, hypertension, CAD statsu post CABG in [**2162**], who
presented with two days of confusion and mental status changes
at her nursing home. [**Name (NI) **] son reports that he saw her [**2-4**]
days prior to admission and she was her usual
self--conversational, alert, oriented, and with mild memory
difficulties. [**Name (NI) **] son went to see her on the morning of
[**1-30**] and noted that she was writhing, lying in the fetal
position and noticed shallow breathing. He could not elicit more
detailed complaints out of her as she was not verbal on the day
of admission.
.
Per the nursing home reports, she was hypoxic to the 70s on the
morning of admission. It increased to the 90s% on 2-4L NC.
Vomited x1 on morning of admission. Emesis was nonbilious and
nonbloody. She was incontinent of stool x4, when she is
typically continent. Last hemodialysis was on Friday (is on MWF
schedule). Has had increasing confusion over the last few days.

.
In the ED, she was febrile to 101.4 and was cultured. She was
hypertensive to 160s-190s systolic. CXR demonstrated fluid
overload, with a question of pneumonia. A blood gas revealed an
ABG 7.46/27/183. Initial lactate was 2.6. She was placed on
BiPAP and as she could not be weaned from BiPAP, was admitted to
MICU. She initially received one gram of vanco, 1g of ceftaz,
80mg of gentamicin. He received one dose of ASA 600mg PR.
.
In the MICU, patient was getting dialyzed and was found to be
more unresponsive, cyanotic, not at all moaning or responding to
sternal rub. She was intubated for airway protection,
tachypneic, appeared moribund. L subclavian triple lumen placed,
as well. HD was discontinued and 1L NS was run in through the HD
catheter wide open. At that point, patient appeared somewhat
more responsive.

Past Medical History:
-ESRD on HD (m/w/f)
-Status post right hip repair in [**2174-8-2**] which has prompted
prolonged nursing home stay
-Hypertension
-CABG x3 in [**2172**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] (found to have 3VD on cath)
-Arthritis
-Neuropathy
-Laparscopic cholecystectomy in summer [**2174**]
-Left temporal CVA [**11-7**]
-Pneumothorax after line placement in [**2174-12-2**] status post
chest tube
-Herpes zoster right t3/t4 in [**2174-11-2**]

Social History:
Widowed, resides at [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital1 **] NH, four children, no
tobacco, no ETOH. Generally pleasant but tends to isolate. Her
four children visit her but she does not speak with them very
often.


Family History:
Mother had coronary artery disease.

Pertinent Results:
Images:
AV fistulogram ([**2175-2-8**]):  Left AV fistulogram demonstrates good
flow in the anterior side of the fistula to the cephalic vein.
Also there is patent subclavian, and SVC veins.
.
EKG ([**2175-1-30**]): 97bpm, NSR, LAFB, TWI in V2 (old)
.
Chest Xray Portable ([**2175-2-3**]):  Perhaps slight improvement in
pulmonary edema.  Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis or
consolidation.
.
Chest xray ([**2175-2-2**]):  Left subclavian vein catheter tip is in
the lower SVC.  Right subclavian catheter tip is in the right
atrium.  Left lower lobe collapse is persistent.  Small right
pleural effusion is stable.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.
There is no pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
.
CXR ([**2175-1-30**]):  1.  Pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural
effusions, new since the [**2174-12-15**] plain radiograph. 2.
Confluent opacity in the right mid-lung zone and base likely
represents alveolar edema, though pneumonic consolidation is a
consideration. 3.  No supine evidence of pneumothorax.
.
Cardiac ([**2175-1-31**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to apical
anteroseptal/anterior hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen.
.
Abdominal U/S ([**2175-1-31**]):  1.  Unremarkable liver and no biliary
dilatation. 2.  Status post cholecystectomy. 3.  Bilateral
pleural effusions, loculated on the right. 4.  Atrophic kidneys.

.
TTE ([**2174-11-25**]): [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated, RV mildly dilated, EF 60-70%,
1+ MR, mild pulmonary HTN.
.
Micro:
Blood ([**1-30**]):  Staph aureus coag +.
.
Endotracheal ([**2-1**]):  Yeast.  Staph aureus coag +.
.
Stool ([**1-31**], [**2-2**]):  C. dificile negative.
