Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
70 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x2, atrial fibrillation (on coumadin
at presentation) presented to an OSH (> 2 weeks ago) with 3 days
of fever, hemoptysis, cough, chills, and dyspnea. CT revealed
diffuse airspace disease, predominant in the R and lower lobes.
His initial labs were WBC 6.6, HCT 38, Plt 199, Cr 0.6, TBili
2.7, DBili 0.7, AST 19, ALT 33. He was then treated empirically
for CAP with ceftriaxone/azithromycin but had continuing
hemoptysis, dyspnea, and developed [**First Name3 (LF) 5283**] abdominal pain. Patient
was noted to have dropping HCT despite transfusion and worsening
respiratory distress. He was then transferred to the ICU,
intubated and given with additional pRBC and FFP. His TBili
increased to 4.3 with a Direct Bili of 1.8 and ALT increased to
32 and AST to 63. Patient had a [**First Name3 (LF) 5283**] ultrasound and CT that were
remarkable only for layering gallbladder sludge vs. small
stones. GI consult suggested [**Doctor Last Name 9376**] disease. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.
At the time of admission to the MICU ([**2187-8-12**]): Tmax= 102, Hct
25, INR 1.3, TBili 4.5, AST of 58, LDH 366, Lipase 92, Alb 3.0,
Na 130. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed and demonstrated
frank blood in all airways without any endobronchial lesions.
Due to his multilobe involvement and diffuse bleeding and high
temperature of 102 he was then placed on triple Abx for presumed
necrotizing pneumonia: Vancomycin, Azithromycin, and ZOSYN. He
was intubated for about  1 week because of hypoxemia and ARDS.
Because of the bleeding both coumadin (which he normally takes
for his A-fib) and aspirin were held. During [**8-12**] and [**8-13**], he
was given a total of 6 u pRBC, which raised the HCT to 33 (an
inappropriate increase suggesting possible hemolysis). Patient
was found to be p-ANCA +. This then suggested either microscopic
polyangiitis (MPA) or Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**] syndrome. The findings that
make Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**] less likely are the absence of asthma and no
eosinophilia. Consistent with MPA are the findings of hemoptysis
and hematuria (with wich the patient presented). Even though the
p-ANCA is nearly 70% specific for MPA, a biopsy could be used
for a more definite diagnosis (specifically necrotizing
inflammation of arterioles, capillaries, and venules w/o
granulomas or eosin).  Accordingly, Rheumatology was consulted
and suggested likely MPA, with the rec of starting high dose IV
steroids and Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. Patient's pulmonary
function improved and he was successfully extubated on [**8-20**].
However, his elevated TBili kept increasing, following a bimodal
pattern:
([**8-14**]): TBili 16
([**8-18**]): TBili 7.2
([**8-22**]): TBili 23
([**8-25**]): TBili 10
with a IndirectBilli in the range of [**1-23**]. Concurrently his LFT's
started increasing considerably:
([**8-19**]): ALT 60,  AST 69,  LDH 657,  AlkPhos 93
([**8-22**]): ALT 168, AST 147, LDH 1103, AlkPhos 164
([**8-25**]): ALT 267, AST 100, LDH 608,  AlkPhos 160, Amylase 123.
Due to increasing LFTs Hepatology was consulted, and suggested
that the pattern of lab abnormalities combined with the
patient's clinical picture point to a drug reaction. Based on
lab/imaging studies there is no evidence for viral or alcoholic
hepatitis and history and imaging are not consistent with NASH.
Although many medications can cause cholestatic jaundice, they
suspect a reaction to Zosyn. Expected to resolve with stopping
the offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] however MRCP performed on [**8-24**] showed no
evidence of intrahepatic biliary disease. A [**8-13**] [**Name (NI) 5283**] sono showed
gallbladder sludge and [**Doctor Last Name 5691**], no biliary ductal dilatation and
trace perihepatic free fluid. Furthermore, the increased LDH and
TBilli, as well as low haptoglobin (<20) was suggestive of a
delayed hemolytic anemia in the setting of multiple blood
transfusion. After examining the transfused blood it was
determined that 5 u pRBCs that were transfused were JK positive
and the patients blood was JK antibody positive, suggestive of a
transfusion reaction that would increase the IndirectBilli.
Concomitantly, the presumed liver toxicity induced by zosyn and
resulting intrahepatic cholestatis could potentially explain the
increase in DirectBilli.
On the morning of [**8-22**] the patient had a tonic-clonic seizure.
While on the bed pan talking to the nurse, he suddenly gave out
a yelp, his body became tense, head and eye movement turned to
the right, followed by jerking of his right arm for about 1
minute. The nurse administered 2mg Ativan IV and there was a
gradual resolution of movement, followed by about 15 min of
confusion. There was no apparent bowel incontinence or tongue
biting. The patient doesn't remember the seizure and returned to
his basline mental status (AOx3). Neurology was then consulted,
differential included new stroke due to vasculitis vs.
cardioembolic (off coumadin) Another possiblity was
re-expression of a prior stroke due to toxic metabolic
infectious abnormalities. The seizure unlikely to be related to
the hyperbilirubinemia. An head MRI was done on [**8-22**] showing no
acute infarcts, minimal amount of chronic microangiopathic
changes, and a normal MRA of the head.
