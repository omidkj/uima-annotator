Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 64F with sarcoidosis, h/o left lower lobe wedge
resection for pulmonary nodules, and tracheobronchomalacia who
was recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 40041**]) for removal of Y stent and
debridement of granulation tissue in the L mainstem bronchus who
now presents with increased shortness of breath--could not walk
to bathroom without severe dyspnea--went to OSH, found to be in
rapid afib; started dilt gtt at OSH, and transferred here, where
she was in sinus rhythm on dilt gtt. However, still dyspneic.

In the ED, still on dilt gtt. CTA looks like collapse of LLL (no
PE); IP aware, and plan bronch tomorrow (NPO p MN, coags
buffed). 85, 102/65, 25, 93-6% 3L.

ROS: Had been constipated during recent hospital stay, then had
large BM at home. The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight
change, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia,
chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Laboratories:
OSH labs this morning notable for TnI 0.04, BNP 17, CBC and
lytes similar to ED labs here.

ECG: Sinus rhythm at 91 bpm, nml axis, incomplete RBBB, ant T
waves are flat, similar to [**2169-11-26**].

Imaging:
CXR: There is atelectasis at the left lung base. There is stable
cardiomegaly. The right lung is clear.
CONCLUSION: Minimal stable atelectasis in the left lower lobe
with no acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA Chest [**2169-11-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Worsening left basilar collapse, presumably secondary to
collapse of the left mainstem bronchus, likely due to the
patient's known diagnosis of
tracheobronchomalacia. Extrinsic compression is less likely,
though there is some increased soft tissue surrounding the area
of the collapsed left mainstem bronchus, and scattered
borderline mediastinal lymph nodes as previously described.

TTE [**2169-12-1**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
64yoF with tracheobronchomalacia, recently admitted for removal
of Y stent in the L mainstem, now with LLL collapse, likely from
mucus plugging, pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for new onset afib
requiring a Diltiazem drip.
.
# Dyspnea/LLL collapse: [**11-30**] bronchoscopy revealed
reaccumulation of granulation tissue and mucous which appeared
purulent. BAL could not be sent due to limited size of her
airways. She was started on Vanc/Cefepime day 1=[**12-1**], 7 day
course complete on [**2169-12-7**] for healthcare associated pneumonia.
PICC line was placed [**2169-12-1**]. Pt was continued on [**Month/Day/Year **]
suppressants, supplemental oxygen as needed, and nebulizer
treatments. Sats remained stable throughout this hospitalization
on 2-3L oxygen via nasal cannula.
.
# afib: Pt has had new afib observed over a few days prior to
her unit admission, with poor rate control on arrival from OSH.
Pt was initially transferred from the ED to the ICU on a
diltizaem however several hours into admission was able to be
weaned to PO Diltiazem and Metorpolol. Given her CHADS2 score of
1, pt was not started on anticoagulation. Noted to be in sinus
rhythm on day of transfer so no DCCV was initiated. A TSH was
checked for the a. fib work up and was 0.081 with a free T4 of
1.9. She had no further episodes of atrila fibrillation HD [**12-19**].
TTE on [**2169-12-1**] revealed mildly dilated left atrium. LVEF 70%.

# HTN: on micardis 40/12.5 at home, as well as lasix and toprol
XL 25mg daily. Her Toprol was continued at her home dose, but
her outpatient micardis was held. She was started on diltiazem
30mg QID for control of her atrial fibrillation as well as
control of her blood pressure. Her blood pressure was stable on
this regimen.

# asthma: Pt was continued on montelukast, advair 250-50 [**Hospital1 **]
.
# allergic rhinitis: Pt was continued on fluticasone nasal,
zyrtec
.
# sarcoidosis, h/o serositis: not active. Continued prednisone
taper and bactrim for PJP prophylaxis.
.
# chronic pain: continued cyclobenzaprine, oxycodone
.
# OSA: continued home CPAP of 12 cm H20

In the out patient: Diltiazem can be changed to long acting
formulation, or alternatively, discontinued, and her BBloker
dose can be increased to 50
