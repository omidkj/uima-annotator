Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86946**] is a 45 year old gentleman with stage 4 tracheal SCC
s/p cisplatin/etoposide, docetaxel, XRT, tracheal stenting x2,
cryotherapy via debulking found to have a TE fistula now
admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.  Over the course
of today, the patient developed increasing shortness of breath
at rest, worsening chronic cough productive of green/yellowish
sputum, increasing fatigue, and a subjective fever with a
recorded temperature of 99.9 oral.  In addition, his son notes
that he was increasingly confused today. He was then brought to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.  Of note, the patient most
recently underwent rigid bronchoscopy on [**3-24**] with tumor
debulking via cryotherapy.  He had previously had tracheal
stents placed in [**11-18**] and [**12-19**], and was found to have a TE
fistula in [**3-21**] on barium swallow.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, inital VS 100.3 119 103/61 20 95%RA.
He had a CXR that demonstrated possible left base consolidation.
He received vancomycin and 1L IVF, and a CT Trachea per IP. He
was then admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably. He and his family
state that his breathing is significantly improved compared to
earlier today. He denies any CP, palpitations, abd pain, n/v/d,
LE swelling, HA, orthopnea, or PND.

Timeline
--[**8-/2131**] presented with hoarseness to ENT. Fiberoptic
nasopharyngolaryngoscopy demonstrating a right true vocal cord
paralysis; subsequent CT scan of neck/chest revealed a large
paratracheal mass.
-- [**2131-9-24**] underwent rigid bronchoscopy with tumor excision and
endobronchial biopsy; pathology revealed poorly-differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma.
-- He was briefly lost to follow up.
-- [**2131-11-21**] PET scan showed irregular right posterior tracheal
mass with extension into the tracheal lumen.
-- [**2131-11-28**] Flexible bronchoscopy on showed ~5 cm lesion of
proximal trachea occluding 50-60% of lumen.
-- [**2131-11-29**] rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and 20x40
metallic Ultraflex covered stent placement. EUS [**2131-11-28**]
suggested tumor invasion of the esophagus with enlargement of 3
paraesophageal lymph nodes.
-- [**2131-12-4**] admitted to ICU from clinic for urgent RT for
progressive dyspnea and urgent flexible bronchoscopy which
revealed extrinsic compression of the stent to 50% diameter and
tumor spread down the distal trachea.
-- [**2131-12-6**] began RT for planned 5400cGy
-- [**2131-12-7**] C1D1 Cisplatin/Etoposide similar to SWOG regimen for
IIIA/B NSCLC
-- [**2131-12-11**] percutaneous gastrostomy placed
-- [**2131-12-18**] admitted with fever to 103 after 1750cGy, on
Vanc/Cef/Mica.
-- [**2131-12-21**] repeat bronch with deployment of metallic Ultraflex
covered stent [**41**] x 40mm within the existing stent. This achieved
90% patency of the stent. It was noted then that there was 3 cm
of distal tumor spread towards the carina from the preexisting
stent.  Tumor growth was noted proximal and distal to the stent.
-- [**2131-12-24**] completed 2600 of planned 5400cGy
-- [**2131-12-25**] Chest CT: with unchanged tracheal findings and
interval resolution of some GGO in the lung.
-- [**2131-12-28**] Docetaxel 75mg/m2, progression after Cis-Etop
-- [**2132-1-14**] Completed 5400cGy RT to upper airway
-- [**2132-1-30**] repeat bronch with patent stent and no endobronchial
lesions.
-- [**2132-3-3**] CT neck with interval decrease in size of the
posterior tracheoesophageal groove mass compared to prior.  Some
soft tissue along the luminal aspect of the stent.
-- [**2132-3-24**] Bronch with distal tumor growth, biopsy confimred
recurrent poorly differentiated carcinoma. Cryotherapy tumor
debulking.

REPORTS:

CXR [**2132-4-27**]:
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained.
Tracheal stent is again seen, unchanged in position. There are
low lung
volumes. There has been apparent interval increase in bilateral
ground-glass
opacities. Infectious process cannot be excluded. Patchy left
base
retrocardiac opacity is seen which may be due to atelectasis,
although
infection and/or aspiration is not excluded. There is slight
blunting of the
left costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying
atelectasis or small
consolidation, small trace effusion cannot be excluded. No
evidence of
pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
stable. A
gastric tube is again noted.

CT Trachea [**2132-4-27**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval enlargement of a tracheal mass with extensive
extratracheal
extension posteriorly and [**Last Name (un) **] near total occlusion of the
tracheal lumen below
the lower margin of the metallic stent.
2. New right laryngocele.
3. Enlargement of prevascular, precarinal, right hilar and
subcarinal lymph
nodes since [**2132-3-3**].
4. Bilateral lower lobe and right upper lobe pneumonia and
bronchiolitis,
likely due to aspiration.
5. Presence of gas within the retrotracheal mass at the upper
margin of the
stent raises the possibility of localized perforation, a
potential stent
complication. Differential diagnosis includes necrosis/secondary
infection of
the retrotracheal mass and iatrogenic (if recent biopsy).



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86946**] is a 45 year old gentleman with stage 4 tracheal SCC
s/p cisplatin/etoposide, docetaxel, XRT, tracheal stent x2,
cryotherapy debulking found to have a TE fistula now admitted to
the MICU for respiratory distress.

1. Goals of care: Extensive family meeting involving the
patient, family, hospice, palliative care. Given the patient's
terminal illness, decision was made for the patient to be
comfort care only, DNR/DNI with no escalation of care.

2. Comfort care: Patient had a PICC line placed prior to
discharge for administration of a morphine PCA. Other comfort
medications provided at the time of discharg
