Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:
Patient transfered from floor to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**8-1**] secondary to
decreased O2 sat despite NRB mask.  A CT scan was done on [**8-1**]
which showed bilateral pneumonia left > right.  Patient also had
serial CXRs which showed minimally improving left lower lobe
PNA.  Patient refused HIV testing but a CD4 count that was drawn
came back as 60.  Patient was continued on treatment for
hospital acquired PNA with vancomycin, azithromycin, and
ceftriaxone which was later switched to just azithro and
caftriaxone for CAP.  Since patient had low CD4 count was
started on treatment for PCP PNA with prednisone and bactrim (21
day treatment).  Induced sputum was done which confirmed PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] also with thrush so started on nystatin.  During [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
stay he had a run of [**Last Name (LF) 6059**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] cardiology consulted.  A TTE was
ordered to rule out seeding of heart valve; there were no masses
or vegetations seen.  He did not have another episode of [**First Name3 (LF) 6059**].
He also had a complaint of headache "the worst headache he has
ever had" so LP and CT head were done which both came back
negative.  Patient continued to remain stable and slowly improve
in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] so was transferred to floor on NRB mask on [**8-5**]

On Floor
1) PNA - Continued Bactrim 400mg IV q8 (eventually switched to
PO Bactrim DS 2tabs q8) and prednisone.  Prednisone was tapered

remaining 11 days.  Patient for first few days on floor remained
on NRB mask but slowly improved and gradually tansitioned to
nasal cannula with weaning of oxygen as tolerated.  Patient
remianed afebrile on floor and WBC remained within normal
limits.  He will be discharge with another 8 days of Bactrim and
prednisone to complete 21 day courses, along with home oxygen
for ambulation.

2) Oral Thrush - Continued nystatin swish and swallow, gradually
improved while on floor.

3) Low back pain - Patient complaining of low back pain while on
floor.  Initially treated with IV morphine, ibuprofen and
oxycodone, then transitioned to flexerol and ibuprofen with
oxycodone for breakthrough.  Patient never had any symptoms of
weakness or numbness in his lower extremeties.  No gait
