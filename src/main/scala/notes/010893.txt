Flexible bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
78 M with complicated past medical history presented from
[**Hospital3 105**] for rigid bronchoscopy and possible tracheal
stenting. Patient spirometry consistent with COPD and asthma. In

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully
excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). TVI E/e' >15, suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg.
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. No AS.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild (1+) MR. Prolonged (>250ms)
transmitral
E-wave decel time. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal image quality
- poor apical
views.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Tissue
velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased
left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is
not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired
relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2161-9-25**] 8:08 AM

PORTABLE ABDOMEN

Reason: nausea / vomiting r/o obstruction

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old man with resp failure s/p aspiration
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
nausea / vomiting r/o obstruction
INDICATION: 78-year-old man with respiratory failure status post
aspiration. Nausea and vomiting. Rule out obstruction.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: A single supine portable radiograph of the abdomen
and pelvis was obtained. A paucity of bowel gas is identified
with no obviously dilated bowel identified. Stool is identified
within the colon. G tube is identified and appears unremarkable.
No obvious evidence of free intraperitoneal air, however, full
evaluation for free air is limited by supine technique.

Evaluation of osseous structures reveals an ill-defined bony
formation ab
