Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred to the medical service for shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none (tracheostomy removed)

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with multiple medical problems
who presents from the SICU for shortness of breath. Patient was
in her usual state of health until she developed gallstone
pancreatitis. She was sent to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] where an ERCP was performed.
The course was complicated by tracheostomy, percutaneous
gastrostomy, and percut cholecystectomy tube. She was treated
with a course of imipenem for her pancreatitis. She had a
positive abd tap with VRE that was treated with linezolid (d/c'd
[**4-19**]) and flagyl until [**2161-4-21**].
During this hospitalization she was found to have ischemia and
atrial arrythmias. She had EKG changes and increased troponin.
Next she was found to have UTI with klebsiella and tracheal
aspirate with MRSA. She became septic with probably urosepsis
and was taken to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] icu. She was treated with vanc, zosyn, and
flagyl. Bile cultures were positive for VRE on [**2161-4-28**]. She
improved markedly and was sent back to [**Hospital1 **].
She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-23**] with concern of cellulitis and
foot ischemia. She was on the vascular service for possible
surgical intervention for her foot. She was transferred to the
SICU when her O2 sat dropped to 70-80s on the floor. She was
aggressively diuresed and has improved.
Currently she has no complaints. She says her breathing is much
better and that she would like to eat. She denies

urine cx from [**5-27**] with foley growing garnerella

cxray with pleural effusions

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P [**Age over 90 **] year old female with multiple medical problems, h/o gall
stone pancreatitis, VRE in bile, MRSA in trach asperate, and
klebsiella uti, presenting originally for vascular evaluation of
necrotic toes, subsequently transfered to medicine with
shortness of breath.
.
1) necrotic toes: patient does not have pain. Source may be
embolic from afib. She does have a hx of stroke. Patient does
not want any intervention at this time and she states that she
makes her medical decision, [**Name (NI) 653**] son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 47781**],
no angio done to date
.
2) shortness of breath- several potential etiologies, most
likely etiology is chf-elevated jvp, uncomfortable when lying
flat. Patient improved with aggressive diuresis
-blt pleural effusions seen on chest xray
-echo with restrictive filling pattern, could be restrictive
cardiomyopathy
-cont 100 IV lasix once a day for a few more days.  Patient at
the end of hospitalization was close to euvolemic so lasix
should be d/c'd as soon as patient looks clinically euvolemic
.
3) CV:
Atrial arrythmias- at outside hosipital, she was treated with IV
esmolol or IV dilt for tachyarrhytmias, hesistant to use long
acting beta blocker or CCB as patient has intermittent
junctional rhyhtm. Consider pacemaker, when the patient does
develop a junctional rhytym, she has a fall in bp which is
consistent with DD and loss of atrial kick
-admission EKG shows evidence of AV dissociation
- h/o of afib - unclear why not on coumadin. Will hold off for
now, since patient is treated with ASA
- we held digoxin during this hospitalization as this can be
associated with AV disassiocation, and supratherapeutic digoxin
level, if patient goes back into rapid atrial fibrillation
restart of digoxin or start of betablocker therapy should be
considered
- echo with restrictive pattern with low normal ef (50 - 55 %)

- started on aspirin,
-captopril 37.5 TID , should continue to titrate up as needed
- cardiac enzymes trending down with no chest pain or ekg
changes
.
4) ID: leukocytosis- decreasing over this hospitalization
although all cultures negative. Stress reaction necrotic leg is
most likely
-d/c'd levo and d/c linezolid as [**11-13**] day treatment completed
-chest xray with b/l pleural eff
-there was no indication for abdominal tap during this
hospitilization
-she was found to have garnerella from urine cx but was thought
to be related to colonization with foley since patient did not
have any symptoms
.
5) GI: Biliary drain is draining well; we think she was
adequately treated for recent VRE in bile
-increased amylase and lipase were likely due to her old
pancreatitis, not likely clinically relevant;
-would recheck amylase/lipase in a few days to make sure that
the enzymes are not trending upwards- lipase was ~200 at d/c
with no clincial sequelae of pancreatitis
.
6) FEN: contraction alk with rep. compensation
**needs speech and swallow consult**, npo for now
continue tube feeds for now,
.
7) Gout: patient has hx of gout, elevated uric acid, was treated
with colchicine.  Patient got better over the next two days.
Colchicine should be d/c'd when the patient's left second finger
is no longer painful and a allopurinol should be considered.
.
8) small lesions on tips of 2 fingers- no pain, seems chronic,
please contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 47782**] of vascular surgery for follow up
within 3-4 weeks
.
9) PPX: continue heparin SQ TID while inactive, protonix, bowel
regimen
.
10) code: full, have [**Last Name (STitle) 653**] son for a full discussion
