Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 72502**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F/ w/ h/o GERD, venous insufficiency,
HTN, DM and recurrent UTIs who presents from [**Hospital1 1501**] with 2 days of
weakness and lethargy. Patient was also noted to have
bradycardia to upper 40-50s, and there was concern for pacemaker
dysfunction. Of note, the pt had a recent admission from [**2122-3-15**]
to [**2122-3-18**] for fever and AMS and was treated for a UTI.
.
At patient's [**Hospital1 1501**], noted to have R sided crackles, 88% RA,
baseline 93% or greater, pulse- 48-50. The NP had thought pt had
lower limit of pacer of 60 (leading her to question if the pacer
was fuctioning poorly) but pt has had pulses in 50s consistently
in past here. concerned about pacemaker function. Last
telephonic interrogation was reportedly normal on [**2122-3-25**]. NP
also confirmed pt's son and HCP wanted the pt full code
.
In our ED, the pt was oriented x2, pleasant but poor historian.
RA sat 88%. EKG was paced and c/w prior EKGs also paced at 50s.
The pt had a CXR with pleural effusions. CT abdomen was
performed for abd tenderness which showed ?appendicitis. Surgery
was consulted in the ED and thought the pt's suprapubic
tenderness was c/w UTI. Pt also had a pericardial effusion on CT
abd and cards was called but was not impressed. TTE [**4-11**] showed
small pericardial effusion. She was given levofloxacin given
inability to rule out pneumonia hidden by pleural effusions. Pt
was also noted to have a UTI. In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have
poor UOP from foley while getting 75 D5NS/hr. The pt's HCP was
not contact[**Name (NI) **] while the pt was in the [**Name (NI) **]. On transfer from the
ED, vitals were: T 98.1 P 50 paced BP 129/52 R 17 O2 sat 98% on
2l NC. 2 peripheral IVs were placed in the ED.
.
In the ICU, patient was monitored overnight. Patient was very
stable, remained bradycardic, recent interogation of pacer
showed it was working normally. Patient's abx was changed to
ceftriaxone based on prior sensitivities, urine sensitivities
pending. Patient's course was uneventful and was called out to
the floor.

IMAGING:
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2122-4-11**] 2:32 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of appendicitis.
2. Small pericardial effusion with enhancing pericardium
suggesting a
potential serosanguineous/exudative nature of the effusion.
Clinical
correlation is recommended.
3. Bilateral renal cysts.

CT CHEST [**2122-4-13**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. No pulmonary masses.
Bilateral
pleural and pericardial effusion. Extensive coronary and aortic
calcifications. Partly calcified thyroid nodules. Bilateral
renal cysts.

TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate
estimated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of
hemodynamic compromise.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Small circumferential
pericardial effusion. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with
preserved global biventricular systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
# UTI:  Pt grew 10-100,000 ecoli from urine and had suprapubic
pain. She was treated c 7d course of ceftriaxone.  Blood
cultures from [**4-10**] were negative. Pt was started on suppressive
abx with bactrim ss daily as her family feels that her frequent
UTIs are interfering with her happiness. BLOOD CULTURES FROM
[**4-13**] WERE PENDING AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE, BUT NO GROWTH TO
DATE.
.
# pleural effusions/O2 req: Felt to be most likely [**12-30**] CHF,
though diastolic dysfunction is relatively mild. Pt could have
PE which can cause pleural effusions, however, that seems less
likely in setting of therapeutic INR. Pt did have chest CT to
r/o which large tumor or pneumonia, which was negative for both.
Thoracentesis was discussed with family and the risks and
benefits shared with them. Both family ([**Doctor First Name **]) and MDs agreed
that risks outweighed the benefits in this elderly lady in whom
the most likely dx remains CHF. Pt was diuresed with lasix and
4doses of acetazolamide and was breathing comfortable on room
air on
