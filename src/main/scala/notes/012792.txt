[**2102-6-5**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated two vessel CAD. The LMCA was heavily calcified with
a
distal 50% stenosis. The LAD is heavily calcified with diffuse
disease
up to 70% in the mid and proximal vessel. The LCX was moderately

calcified with proximal tapering through two retroflexed turns
to an
eccetric tubular 70% stenosis. The very high OM1 demonstrated
ostial 80%
ISR of the old stent. The OM2 was a modest vessel with proximal
70%
disease. The RCA was small and non-dominant.
2. Left ventriculography was defered due to high filling
pressures and
renal insufficiency.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided
filling
pressures with LVEDP=20 mmHg.

[**2102-6-9**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse or flail segments. Mitral annulus in endosystole is
34mm. There is a central regurgitant jet across the mitral valve
with blunting of pulmonary venous inflow and a vena contract of
5-6mm c/w. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2102-6-5**] via
transfer from the [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 18**] for a cardiac catheterization
and further management of his chest pain. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel disease and
plavix was given and heparin was started. Given the severity of
his disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted and Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. He
was noted to be anemic and was transfused with packed-red blood
cells. Dental clearance was obtained by contacting his dentist
prior to his operative date. On [**2102-6-9**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to two vessels as well as a mitral valve repair
using a 27mm duran ancore band. He tolerated the procedure well
and for further details, please refer to operative note.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. By postoperative day one, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was awake, neurologically intact and extubated. His
drains were removed per protocol. He was slowly weaned from
pressors. He was transfused for postoperative anemia. On
postoperative day three, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the
cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. He had some atrial
fibrillation/flutter which was treated successfully with an
increase in his beta blockade. Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed a mild
postoperative renal failure with his creatinine elevating to 2.3
however stabilized with less aggressive diuresis. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
on POD # 6.
