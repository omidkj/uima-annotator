Radiology:

CT spine - avulsion fracture of Rt C2-C3 facet joint w/ loose
body in joint.  Fracture of anterior aspect of C2 w/ body of C2
displaced posteriorly ~ 4.5 mm.  Non-displaced R posterior C4
fracture.  C7 spinous fracture involving posterior ring of C7 w/
small intracanal loose body.  Non displaced T4 vertebral
fracture.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to ICU where close neurochecks were performed.
The patient was placed on spinal and alcohol withdrawl
precautions.  No other injuries were noted.  On his first
hospital day he was noted to have slight weakness of his right
arm and clonus in his right lower leg.  An MRI was ordered to
rule out spinal cord injury.  Mr [**Known lastname **] needed to be intubated
prior to the MRI.  The MRI showed: Fracture at C2 level without
marrow edema but given the prevertebral soft tissue changes,
this may represent an acute fracture.  Increased signal within
the spinal cord at C2 and C3 level has an unusual appearance of
post-traumatic contusion. This could represent focal cord
infarct or a preexisting lesion. Moderate-to-severe spinal
stenosis at C5-6 which appears to be secondary to disc
osteophyte complex with indentation on the spinal cord and
increased signal within the spinal cord indicative of cord
edema/myelomalacia.  Fractures of the spinous process of C6 and
C7 with extensive soft tissue edema extending from this region
superiorly. Fracture of T5 vertebral body without significant
retropulsion. Abnormal increased signal within the ligamentum
flavum at this level with slight buckling indicative of
ligamentous injury. No evidence of intraspinal hematoma. Subtle
increased signal within the spinal cord at T5 level suggestive
of cord edema/contusion.

The patient was extubated on [**6-15**], he was found to have [**4-10**]
strenght in right upper extremitie.  He was treated with alcohol
withdrawl prophylaxis such as Folate, thiamine and B12.  He was
transferred to the floor on [**6-16**] and fitted with a TLSO brace.

On [**6-19**] he underwent a posterior C2-3 fusion under general
anesthesia.  He tolerated this procedure well and was
transferred to PACU and then floor.

On [**6-20**] the patient had increasing urinary frequency and
required a straight cath x 1. Overnight his UOP was normal. He
has a post-void residual of 22cc on the morning of [**6-21**] and has
no other urinary symptoms. Activity and diet were advanced.
Incision was clean and dry. PT and OT evaluated pt and
recommended discharge to rehab facility.
