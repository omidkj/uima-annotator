MICRO:
[**2174-10-9**]- blood culture x 2 - NGTD
[**10-9**] - Urine culture x 2 - NGTD

Relevant Imaging:
EKG. Sius tachycardia at 131 bpm. Normal PR interval, Normal qrs
interval, normal qtc. Normal Axis. no LVH. TWI in R, L, V1. ST
depressions in V4. unchanged from prior EKG dated [**2174-7-28**].

CXR ([**2174-10-9**]): Early left lower lobe bronchopneumonia.

CXR ([**2174-10-14**]): Interstitial infiltrative abnormality, most
pronounced in the lower lungs accompanied by probable small
right pleural effusion has worsened since [**10-11**], probably
pulmonary edema. Heart size top normal. No pneumothorax.

CXR ([**2174-10-16**]): Persistent bilateral interstitial pulmonary
infiltrates
consistent with edema. Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus
likely
representing a small effusion. No definite change.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2174-10-17**]):
1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent bibasilar
opacities,
which could be related to pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.

2. Diffuse smooth septal thickening with ground glass opacity
mostly in upper lobes, suggestive of pulmonary edema, which
could be due to volume
overload, CHF, or non-cardiogenic, drug-induced edema. In an
appropriate
clinical setting, cocaine- induced hemorrhage could also be
possible.
3. Mild centrilobular emphysema.
4. Top normal mediastinal lymph nodes could be reactive or
edematous.
5. Anemia.
6. Severe fatty liver. Atrophic partly calcified pancreas is
probably due to chronic pancreatitis.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2174-10-17**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 62 yo female with history of polysubstance
abuse, DM2, admitted with hypoglycemia and NSTEMI in the setting
of cocaine abuse.

1) Respiratory Distress: The patient was in mild respiratory
distress upon arrival to the emergency room on [**2174-10-9**].  At
that time, CXR showed a new left lower lobe opacity that was
consistent with early bronchopneumonia.  In light of this
respiratory distress, CXR finding, and fever of unknown source
the patient was started on empiric antibiotics for community
acquired pneumonia.  Upon transfer to the MICU, the patient
developed increased respiratory distress requiring oxygen
supplementation.  This was felt to be a result of aggressive IV
fluid resuscitation in the ED.  CXR at that time showed
resolution of the LLL opacity and some increased interstitial
markings felt to be pulmonary edema.  The patient was diuresed
on lasix as needed and responded appropriately with resolution
of her respiratory distress.  Her oxygen requirement decreased
from NRB to 2L NC.  After transfer to the hospital floor, the
patient was weaned to RA with good O2 saturation.  However, on
[**10-14**], the patient was found to again have an O2 requirement of
4L NC at baseline and 5L NC when the patient was ambulating.
She was febrile and complained of having a dry cough.
Differential at this time included pulmonary edema, pneumonia,
or pulmonary complications in the context of her chronic cocaine
abuse.  CXR showed a new RLL opacity c/w pneumonia and pulmonary
edema.  At this time, the patient was started on
ceftriaxone/azithromycin for treatment of community acquired
pneumonia.  Her coverage was broadened to Vancomycin, Zosyn, and
Azithromycin since she continued to spike temperature. The
pulmonary service was consulted at this time. Per their
recommendations, a CT Chest was performed to better evaluate her
pulmonary status.  CT scan demonstrated bilateral pleural
effusions which was consistent with pulmonary edema and some
haziness in the RLL suggestive of a pneumonia. These findings
were felt not be related to her chronic cocaine abuse. She was
agressively diuresed with IV lasic and her respiratory distress
improved. Her antibiotic regimen was changed to Levaquin x 5
days and her fever eventually defervesced. She was discharged on
a low dose of PO Lasix. The patient will also need a follow-up
CAT scan in approximately 6-8 weeks.
