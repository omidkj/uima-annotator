Admission Date: [**2143-10-28**]           Discharge Date:[**2143-12-3**]



Service:  GREEN GENERAL SURGERY

ADDENDUM:  The patient remained an inpatient as on [**2143-11-18**] he had been complaining of a moderate amount of
abdominal pain with some nausea and vomiting.  A KUB was
performed on [**2143-11-19**] revealing persistently
distended bowel loops that was consistent with a prolonged
postoperative ileus versus an evolving partial small bowel
obstruction.  He remained afebrile during this time and his
pain did improve.  At this time, the team decided to make him
n.p.o. on IV fluids to maintain fluid hydration and a
Nutrition consult was made in order for TPN recommendations.
He was started on a day number two starter bag for TPN.

Additionally, a C. difficile specimen was sent since the
patient had also had several episodes of loose stool and this
came back negative.

On [**2143-11-20**], hospital day number 15, the patient's
abdominal distention had improved mildly but he did persist
with multiple episodes of loose stools.  TPN was continued
for nutrition supplementation.

On hospital day number 16 through 19, the patient was
continued on TPN and he was restarted on a p.o. trial on
[**2143-11-21**] which he tolerated without any nausea or
vomiting, but continued to take only small amounts of p.o.
intake.  Repeat C. difficile specimen was again negative and
the patient remained afebrile with normal laboratory values.
The patient's p.o. intake remained around 500 cc per day
despite active encouragement by the nursing and medical
staff.

A Nutrition consult came by on hospital day number 19 and
after discussion with the Surgical staff as well as the
attending, there was discussion whether or not the patient
may benefit from PEG tube placement to maintain enteral
feedings.  This was brought up with the family which included
the patient's wife as well as the patient himself and they
adamantly refused any future attempts for feeding tube
placement, deciding to continue to encourage the patient
eating by mouth.

Marinol was started with small improvement of the patient's
occasional nausea, the patient was continued on Protonix 40
mg IV b.i.d. for his severe reflux disease.

On hospital day number 20, [**2143-11-25**], a repeat KUB was
performed revealing persistently distended bowel loops that
appeared slightly increased from the previous KUB on [**2143-11-19**].  However, there was evidence of gas and fecal
residue in the colon, making a diagnosis consistent with a
prolonged ileus.

On [**2143-11-26**], a nutrition consult determined that the
patient's p.o. estimated intake was 24% of caloric needs and
a small bowel follow through was done at this time revealing
a mild to moderate dilatation of the small bowel, again
likely consistent with an ileus, frank gastroesophageal
reflux disease as well as presbyesophagus and lastly a small
to moderate sized hiatal hernia.

The patient was preopped for PEG tube placement as an effort
to increase his nutritional needs.  However, after a repeat
discussion with the patient and his wife, they decided that
they did not want to undergo PEG tube placement or NG tube
placement for enteral nutrition.

On hospital day number 23, a GI consult was obtained for
assistance with persistently poor p.o. intake and they
recommended considering a trial of tube feeding via a NG tube
and that a PEG tube was appropriate if the family was
willing.  Tube feeds were not attempted via NG tube after the
family resisted measures for alternative enteral feeding.
The patient was continued on his regular diet which was then
changed to a pureed diet and he was supplemented with Boost
and actively encouraged by the nursing staff to take his p.o.
intake.

Meanwhile, the patient continued to do well in all other
respects, ambulating well with no pain.  The patient was
prepared for discharge on hospital day number 27, [**2143-12-2**], and had shown over the past day that he had been
doing well with his p.o. intake, had been able to take all of
his p.o. medications.  There was no evidence of any nausea or
vomiting and he was having his daily bowel movements.

Discharge planning was made through case management with a
rehabilitation facility to continue the patient's prolonged
postoperative care.
