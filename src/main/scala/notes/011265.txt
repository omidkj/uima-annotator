[**2143-10-23**] ECG: nml sinus rhythm at 80, LAD, Q in V2, RSR' in V1,
V2, V3, inverted T waves in III, aVF, v1

[**2143-10-23**] CXR:
"PA & LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart is mildly enlarged
with a left
ventricular configuration. The aorta is mildly unfolded and
calcified.
Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. A retrocardiac
patchy opacity
present is present, which may represent atelectasis or an early
pneumonia.
Remaining lung fields are otherwise clear. No effusions are
demonstrated.
Scarring is seen within the right apex of the lung. Soft tissues
are
unremarkable. Degenerative changes are noted within the thoracic
spine.

IMPRESSION:

1. Mild cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart
failure.
2. Patchy opacity within the retrocardiac region of left lower
lobe, which may
represent atelectasis. An early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be
excluded. "

[**2143-10-23**] Cardiac catheterization:
"INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
elevated cardiac biomarkers, aortic stenosis
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Critical aortic stenosis.
2. Low normal right sided and left sided filling pressures.
3. Severe single vessel coronary artery disease.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed
severe
one vessel coronary artery disease. The left main coronary
artery
revealed no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.
The LAD
demonstrated a diffuse 70% stenosis in the proximal vessel with
an area
of hazy flow beyond the stenosis. The LCX revealed no
angiographically
significant flow limiting stenoses. The RCA was a non dominant
vessel
with mild disease diffusely.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed low normal right sided filling
pressures (mean RA pressure was 4 mm Hg and RVEDP was 8 mm Hg).
Pulmonary artery pressures were normal (PA pressure was 26/10 mm
Hg).
Left sided filling pressures were low normal (mean PCW pressure
was 7 mm
Hg and LVEDP was 12 mm Hg). The cardiac index was normal (at 2.6
L/min/m2). There was a significant gradient across the aortic
valve upon
withdrawal of the catheter from the left ventricle to the
ascending
aorta.
3. The peak-to-peak gradient across the aortic valve was 70 mm
Hg with
a mean gradient of 51 mm Hg and a calculated valve area of 0.54
cm2"


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 87 yo male with 1v CAD (70% diffuse proximal lesion of LAD)
and critical AS (valve area 0.54) who presents with SOB to OSH
in setting of ? infection.
.
1.  CAD/AS: The patient is s/p cardiac catheterization where he
was found to have 1v CAD and critical AS.  The cardiothoracic
surgery team was consulted for a possible AVR and CABG.  The
patient received pre-op workup including CXR, UA and carotid US.
 While awaiting CABG, the patient was medically managed with
metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], 6.25mg captopril TID, ASA 325mg once
daily and statin.
.
2.  Infection:  The pt was afebrile with a low WBC count of 4.4.
 However due to the presence of a chronic cough (as per pt-dry
without sputum) and questionable CXR (consistent with
atelectasis although an early pneumonia can not be ruled out),
the pt was closely monitored for other signs of infection.  The
blood cultures from [**Hospital1 **] have been negative for >48 hours.
.
3.  GERD:  The patient was treated with pepcid without any
complications.
.
4.  Asthma:  The patien was given his outpatient regimen of
Albuterol MDI without complications.
.
5.  Prophylaxis:  Due to the body habitus of the pt, he was
given Heparin sub Q TID for DVT prophylaxis, and colace and
senna for bowel regimen
.
6.  Dispo: Please refer to the addendum from cardiothoracic
surgery for the remainder of the hospital course.
