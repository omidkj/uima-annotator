Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Urinary retention


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Foley catheter placement with continuous bladder irrigation

History of Present Illness:
89 y/o w/ chronic systolic CHF (EF 35%, s/p 4v CABG in [**2132**]),
DM2 with neuropathy, h/o stroke s/p L ICA stenting, CKD,
peripheral and carotid artery disease, and BPH, presents from
rehab for inability to void.

He was recently discharged from an admission to the CCU for an
acute on chronic CHF exacerbation thought to be due to dietary
incompliance and underdosing of his home diuretic.  He was
aggressively diuresed, metoprolol was increased, and he was
continued on his home doses of ramipril and digoxin.  During the
admission, Foley placement was traumatic and resulted in
persistent hematuria.  The Foley was removed, but hematuria
continued prompting replacement of Foley with bladder
irrigation.  His terazosin was discontinued and tamsulosin and
finasteride were started. He was discharged with the Foley to
rehab.  Two days ago, the Foley was removed, but he failed the
voiding trial.  The catheter was replaced, but was not draining,
thought to be due to presence of blood clots and thus the
catheter was removed.  He presented to the ED today with a
markedly distended bladder with inability to void.

Initial ED vitals were: 98.0 62 100/50 20 98%.  A 3 way Foley
was placed by the ED team with poor urine output.  Urology was
then consulted who placed a larger bore catheter and irrigated
approximately 1L of clotted blood and achieved improved urine
output.  He was placed on continuous bladder irrigation.  Labs
were notable for HCT 23 (baseline high 20's to 30's), acute
renal failure (Cr 2.1 baseline Cr 1.5-1.8), hyperkalemia (K 6.5)
with a newly widened QRS on ECG.  He was given 10 units of
insulin, 1 amp of D50, and 30gm of kayexalate with repeat ECG
showing narrow QRS.  Most recent set of vitals: afebrile 80
112/68 100% RA.

On arrival to the MICU, he reported feeling much better.  His
abdominal distention is improved.  Feels thirsty.  Feels tired
and slightly lightheaded after receiving morphine in the ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
URINARY RETENTION/BLADDER STONES/HEMATURIA: Likely secondary to
heavy clotting in the setting of multiple traumatic catheter
placements and BPH. Urology placed a 3-way foley catheter with
irrigation of approximately 1L of clots. He was placed on
continuous bladder irrigation and continued on tamsulosin and
finasteride. Unfortunately, after catheter removal he was still
retaining urine, so it was replaced pending outpatient urology
follow-up. Clopidogrel was stopped on [**2150-11-12**] due to persistent
hematuria; aspirin was continued.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Obstructive, resolved
HYPERKALEMIA: Related to ARF, resolved.
ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA: Secondary to hematuria, treated with 3
units of PRBC
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Stable, asprin continued, plavix held
due to bleeding
ISCHEMIC CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Stable
HISTORY OF EMBOLIC CVA S/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3098**] STENT: Stable
DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE II: treated with insulin until renal
failure resolved.
