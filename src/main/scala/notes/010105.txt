Allergies:
Penicillins / Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with severe CAD s/p CABG with severe 3VD
non-intervenable, PPM, DM2, HTN, HLD, dCHF LVEF 55%, presents
with intermittent left sided chest pain and SOB. He has angina
at baseline but per his son, his chest pain became more frequent
over the past two weeks, now occuring twice daily. At midnight
the night of admission he developed persistent pressure like
chest pain. He took nitro x2 with relief of pain, but rapid
recurrence of pain within minutes. Denied arm, back or jaw pain.
He received 325mg aspirin by EMS.
His 3VD has been evaluated on several occasions. He has chronic
stable angina that is not amenable to percutaneous or surgical
coronary intervention due to the diffuse nature of disease.
In the ED, initial VS were: 96.6 120 157/94 24 100% 12L NRB. ECG
showed Vpaced/tach @ 125, LAD w/negative sgarbossa's criteria.
Labs notable for trop 0.06, Cr 2.3 (baseline 1.6), HCO3 21, WBC
11.2, HCT 29.5, Plt 117, INR 1.2. CXR showed cardiomegaly, new
pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion. Received
morphine 5mg x2, nitro SL. Pain recurred thus prompting
initiation of a nitroglycerin drip. Vitals prior to transfer HR:
125, RR: 22, BP: 140/83, Rhythm: Paced Rhythm, O2Sat: 98,
O2Flow: 3l NC.

Pt brought to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service and while there had trop and CKMB
34 rising and was subsequently brought to the cath lab for
immediate intervention.

ECG	Study Date of [**2137-7-27**]  2:53:48 PM

Probable atrio-ventricular sequential pacing with low amplitude
atrial pacingartifacts. Compared to the previous tracing of the
same date the rate is significantly slower and now appears to be
atrial paced rather than likely sinus. Morphology of the paced
QRS complexes is unchanged, with appropriate secondary
repolarization abnormalities.

CXR (AP) [**2137-7-27**]
FINDINGS:
Left-sided pacemaker ends in the right atrium and right
ventricles.  Moderatecardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, new
compared to [**2137-6-12**].   There is a small left pleural
effusion.
_____________________________________________________

PRE-CATH ECHO [**7-27**]
IMPRESSION: (EF 30-35%) Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild right ventricular
systolic dysfunction. At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-3-20**],
more extensive regional dysfunction is present with extensive
hypokinesis of the distal third of the ventricle and
anterolateral wall. The severity of mitral regurgitation has
increased.

Cardiac Cath [**2137-7-27**]
1.Three vessel coronary artery disease
2.Occlusion of the SVG-OM
3.Occlusion of the SVG to the Acute Marginal
4.Patent stents in the SVG to the diagonal-LAD with progressive
of disease in the native LAD
5.Successful bare metal stent to the native LAD at the
anastomotic site

_____________________________________________________
Post Cath Echo [**2137-7-28**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is
mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary
to dyskinesis of the basal segment of the inferior and posterior
wal
