Service:  [**Company 191**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
male who presented to the Emergency Department with bright
red blood per rectum.  He has a history of arteriovenous
malformation, and colonic adenoma, as well as iron deficiency
anemia.  He reports developing bloody diarrhea on [**2137-3-27**], at which time he presented to the Emergency Department.
He stated he had one episode of watery diarrhea but denies
hematemesis or coffee-grounds emesis.  He also denied
abdominal pain, fever, chills, or back pain.

infection type symptoms and presumed bronchitis.  The patient
also reportedly has a sick contact who was treated for bloody
diarrhea and presumed to have Salmonella.

On presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient had
a blood pressure in the 90s to 80s systolic.  The patient was
responsive to fluids.  His stool was noted to be bright red
with clots.  Nasogastric lavage was negative.  The patient
was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for hypovolemic
shock.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs on
admission revealed a temperature of 96.8, heart rate of 88,
blood pressure of 112/56, respiratory rate of 20, satting
100% on room air.  The patient is pleasant, awake, alert and
oriented times three, in no acute distress.  Pupils were
notable for cataracts.  There was no jugular venous
distention.  No lymphadenopathy.  The oropharynx was clear,
and mucous membranes were moist.  Heart had a regular rate
and rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Chest revealed inspiratory
and expiratory wheezes bilaterally.  No rales.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Bowel sounds were
present.  Extremities had no edema, cool, 1+ distal pulses
bilaterally.  Neurologic examination was grossly nonfocal
with mild right lower extremity weakness and normal cranial
nerve examination.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION: Laboratories on
admission revealed a white blood cell count of 22.6,
hematocrit of 22.4, platelets of 325.  Differential of
85 neutrophils, 1 band, 4 eosinophils.  INR of 1.4.  Sodium
of 132, potassium of 4.8, chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 15,
blood urea nitrogen of 59, creatinine of 2.9, blood sugar
of 192.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm
at 86 with no ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for fluid resuscitation and close
monitoring secondary to lower gastrointestinal bleed.  It was
felt that the bleed was likely secondary to infectious
colitis, possibly provoking another source of bleed.  His
stool was sent for fecal cultures on [**3-28**], with the main
concern being Salmonella given a sick contact.  The patient
was empirically treated with ciprofloxacin to cover
Salmonella and Flagyl to cover Clostridium difficile given
his recent course of azithromycin for bronchitis.

The patient underwent tagged red blood cell scan on [**2137-3-29**], which revealed a right colonic source of bleeding.  A
follow-up angiography was negative for bleeding.

Over the next several days the patient required 12 units of
packed red blood cells transfusion to support hematocrit.  A
Surgical consultation was obtained on [**3-30**], but no
intervention was planned given the fact that angiography was
negative.  The patient underwent an abdominal CT on [**3-30**]
which revealed no free air, no perforation, scattered
diverticula, but no evidence of diverticulitis.

After a stable hematocrit in the middle 30s for 24 hours, the
patient was transferred to the floor on [**3-31**].  Once
admitted to the floor, the patient received a GoLYTELY bowel
preparation for colonoscopy to look for a source of bleeding.

A colonoscopy was attempted on [**4-1**], but the preparation
was inadequate.  The patient's hematocrit remained stable,
and stool was guaiac-negative by that point.

On the evening of [**4-1**], the patient had a maroon bowel
movement followed by bright red blood per rectum, and he was
transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit.

A repeat tagged red blood cell scan showed bleeding source in
the stomach, but a follow-up nasogastric tube was negative,
leading the team to believe that the tagged scan was a false
positive.  The Interventional Radiology as well as Surgical
teams were called to evaluate the patient but neither wanted
to intervene.  The patient's hematocrit remained relatively
stable in the low 30s with a blood transfusion of 1 unit.

On [**4-3**], the patient underwent a colonoscopy after a
repeat bowel preparation.  Colonoscopy revealed a diverticula
in the transverse colon with fresh clot.  Aggressive washing
did not remove the clot, and the area was not intervened on
further.  Neither the Surgical team or the Interventional
Radiology felt that intervention was needed.

On [**4-4**], the patient was again called out to the floor.
His hematocrit was monitored for an additional 24 hours.  It
remained stable, and the patient had no further
guaiac-positive stools.

The patient was discharged on [**4-5**]; but, of note, after
his discharge stool cultures from the [**4-1**] were positive
for giardiasis.  The patient was called at home and started
on Flagyl to treat Giardia.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused a total of 13
units of packed red blood cells during this hospitalization.
After initial transfusion of 12 units, he developed a
DIC-type picture and required 2 units of fresh frozen plasma
and 1 unit of platelets with resolution of coagulopathy.

3.  RHEUMATOLOGY:  Of note, on [**4-3**] the patient developed
a hot, swollen, and painful left knee.  The knee was tapped
and was positive for gout crystals.  Due to contraindication
to oral steroids given his recent significant
gastrointestinal bleed, on [**Month (only) 547**] the knee joint was injected
with corticosteroids resulting in resolution of symptoms.

4.  PULMONARY:  The patient has a history of asthma as well
as an ill-defined lung nodule.  A CT scan done on admission
was concerning for some interstitial lung disease concerning
for bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia.  The
patient's respiratory status was stable throughout this
hospitalization and further workup was deferred to the
outpatient setting.

5.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of
hypertension, but when admitted was in hypovolemic shock.
After fluid resuscitation and stabilization, his blood
pressure was systolic in the 190s/70s.  His Norvasc was
restarted without much result and was changed to
Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d. with good affect.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As noted above, the patient was
initially empirically treated for approximately four days
with ciprofloxacin
