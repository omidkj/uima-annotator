Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
chronic shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2196-3-10**] Atrial septal defect closure with bovine
pericardial patch via right thoracotomy.


History of Present Illness:
57 year old gentleman with a significant past medical history
which includes cornary artery disease status post bypass
surgery,
diabetes, obesity, peripheral vascular disease, atrial
arrythmias
and pacemaker insitu who has a secundum atrial septal defect. He
has noted significant shortness of breath and wheezing which
seems to have gotten worse over the past several months. He was
seen by an allergist who who feels he has signficant seasonal
allergies which are likely contributing to his symptoms.
Although
his shortness of breath is likely multifactorial, there has been
some speculation that the ASD could be contributing to it. His
PA
pressures are in the 50's, were they were 5 years ago and his
QP:QS shunt has remained fairly low at 1.3 5 years ago and now
around 2.0 (using only IVC sats). He was evaluated at [**Hospital1 2025**] for
catheter based repair however did not have an adequate shelf for
a device closure. He presents now for surgical consultation
regarding whether repair of his ASD will significantly help his
dyspnea. He has been hospitalized twice with PNA this year as
well as heart failure with severe dyspnea.

Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE [**2196-3-10**]
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The right atrium is dilated. A left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. A large secundum
atrial septal defect (1.5 cm) is present. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild apical and
distal anterior hypokinesis . Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricle is
dilated and displays normal free wall contractility. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 914**] were notified in person of the results in
the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS After first separation from bypass, two significant
jets of residual left to right flow at the edges of the patch
placed to close the ASD were seen. Patient was returned to full
bypass. After final separation. there is overall normal
biventricular systolic function though focal abnormalities of
the left ventricle as noted in the pre-bypass study persist. A
patch is seen in the interatrial septum. There is a very small
jet (pin-hole sized) of left to right interatrial flow at one
edge of the patch. The tricuspid regurgitation appears somewhat
improved - now mild to moderate. The rest of valvular function
is essentially unchanged from the pre-bypass study. The thoracic
aorta is intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2196-3-10**] where
the patient underwent ASD repair via right thoracotomy with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].   Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight. Preoperative  medications were resumed.
 The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes were discontinued without complication.
Coumadin was resumed for history of atrial fibrillation. EP
interrogated the patient's PPM. He was started on Colchicine and
Indomethacin for 1 month for pericarditis prophylaxis per
request of cardiologist. The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
services in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
