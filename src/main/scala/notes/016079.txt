Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH after PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
73 y/o F w/COPD/asthma, OSA s/p multiple trachs with revision,
diastolic dysfxn, recent pseudomonal pna/sepsis on [**11-14**], who
was in her USOH at her [**Hospital3 **] facility until 2 pm on
[**5-1**] when she was attempting to suction herself and dislodge a
mucus plug.  She was unsuccessful and then called EMS via her
lifeline.  Unclear response time but between 4-20 minutes.  EMS
found her in PEA arrest, cyanotic, and began CPR and gave
atropine and epi.  They were able to dislodge her obstructed
airway and ventilate her trach.

At [**Hospital3 **], she was admitted to the MICU.  She was
hypotensive, and her neuro status was significant for responding
to noxious stimuli but otherwise not following commands.  Her
labs showed a WBC of 19, INR 5.3.  She required pressors
(dopamine) and her neuro exam deteriorated to where she did not
respond to anything, was decerebrate posturing, and had some
seizure activity.  She was loaded with dilantin.  Head CT did
not show a new bleed.  EEG showed anoxic brain injury.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] at this point.

Past Medical History:
1. CHF (R sided diastolic failure).  Last echo [**9-13**] showed
dilated LA, mild LVH, dilated RV with depressed RV fxn, [**12-13**]+MR,
2+TR, small pericardial effusion.  EF 50-55%
2. asthma
3. COPD FEV1 35%, FVC 38%, ratio 91%
4. OSA (on home BIPAP)
5. HTN
6. Afib
7. remote h/o colon ca at age 29, with partial colectomy
8. s/p trach placement [**2161-6-23**] by CT [**Doctor First Name **], followed by
interventional pulmonary here

EEG:
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background rhythm
remained
very slow and of extremely low voltage.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were frequent generalized low voltage
spikes or
sharp waves. These were very brief and did not disturb the
background
substantially. There were no repetitive discharges.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm
suggestive of
atrial fibrillation.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the near
absence of
background of cortical origin. This suggests a widespread and
extremely
severe encephalopathy. There were frequent to very brief sharp
discharges indicating some hyperexcitability, but there were no
repetitive discharges or prolonged discharges to suggest ongoing

seizures.

CXR: FINDINGS: A right central venous catheter is seen with the
tip in the distal SVC. A tracheostomy tube is seen with the tip
approximately 7 cm above the carina. An NG tube is seen
positioned within the stomach. There is a left retrocardiac
opacity with associated pleural effusion. The pulmonary
vasculature is unchanged. Soft tissue and osseous structures are
stable in appearance.

IMPRESSION: Left retrocardiac opacity, which may represent
consolidation, less likely atelectasis. Associated left small
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the medical ICU.  It was felt that
her arrest was related to hypoxia from a mucus plug.  She was
given antibiotics for pneumonia, and she had been febrile and
having large amts of green sputum.  She was also treated for a
COPD flare.  Neurology was consulted to assess her prognosis
after this arrest and felt that she had a very poor prognosis
based on lack of improvement approximately 72 hours after her
event.  She became hypotensive requiring levophed, felt to be
due to sepsis as she had gram positive cocci growing from her
blood.  Her dilantin was discontinued per neurology
recommendations.  She then developed myoclonic jerking and was
reloaded with dilantin.  EEG demonstrated severe encephalopathy.
 At this point a family meeting was held and it was decided to
make her comfort measures only.  She died on [**2162-5-8**] at 9:21 pm
with her family by her side.
