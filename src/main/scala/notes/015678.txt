History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with h/o colon adenoca, s/p open
sigmoidectomy for colonic adenoca [**2149-6-12**], COPD, DM, EtOH
cirrhosis, who is admitted with hypotension and malaise.

Patient was hospitalized [**Date range (1) 62159**], course complicated by VAP
and afib with RVR, and discharged to rehab. He was seen in
colorectal clinic on [**6-26**], where he had his remaining staples
removed and packing replaced. He came to the ED today
complaining of [**2-28**] days of fatigue and found it difficult to get
out of bed this morning. The patient has had intermittent red
blood in his stools since his surgery. Stooling is not
associated with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or
constipation. He is having [**1-27**] bowel movements per day. He
denies abdominal pain or drainage from his incision. He has no
erythema, or dehiscence of his abdominal incision. Does have
some shortness of breath with exertion and a chronic cough
productive of scant yellow sputum. No fever, chest pain,
lightheadedness, palpitations.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.8 65 93/60 20 95% 2LNC. Exam with
rales, pitting edema, serosanguinous drainage from the incision,
and guaiac positive brown stool. Labs notable for HCT 26.3, down
from 34.5 yesterday, but was stable at 28 post-op last week. CXR
with RLL compressive atelectasis with associated pleural
effusion. The patient was given 750cc IVF, nebs, and
Azithromycin. Surgery was consulted in the ED, but did not think
there was an acute surgical issue and recommended admission to
medicine.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 98.6 70 103/56 17 96%2LNC.

STUDIES
Chest Xray [**2149-6-27**]
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate
hyperexpanded
lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms bilaterally.  There
is right
basilar atelectasis, and a small right pleural effusion.  There
is gaseous
colonic distention.  There is osteopenia, and exaggerated
thoracic kyphosis.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
mediastinal contours are normal.

IMPRESSION:  Emphysema. Right basilar atelectasis with a small
right pleural effusion.
.
CTA [**2149-6-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Acute pulmonary emboli to the right upper and lower lobes.
2.  Right greater than left moderate and small pleural
effusions.  Right
greater than left atelectasis.
.
Abdomen x ray [**6-28**]:
Distended colon.  If further delineation is desired, this would
best be performed by CT.
.
Chest xray post PICC [**2149-6-29**]:
There is a new left PICC line with tip in the low SVC.  This was

discussed with IV nurse, [**Doctor First Name **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26665**] on [**6-29**] at 2:20
by telephone.

The right hemidiaphragm is obscured by combination of
effusion/volume
loss/infiltrate.  This has increased compared to the prior exam.
 The left
lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.

[**2149-7-2**] Sigmoidoscopy
Along the anastomosis site, near one of the staples, a
superficial ucler approximately 2 cm without stigmata of
bleeding. Clotted blood was noted in the area. The blood was
washed off and the underlying mucosa appeared normal. More
proximal to this ulcer was formed stool. No other pathology was
noted. Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to surgical anastomosis

[**2149-7-3**] KUB:
IMPRESSION:  Extensive amount of free air.

[**2149-7-3**] CT Abd:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Large amount of debris anterior to the anastomotic site with
contrast as well as possibly separated suture material.  No
apparent bowel wall can be noted through this section,and he
consistent with anastomotic rupture.
Massive amount of free air is apparent.
2.  Hypoenhancing areas within the liver, most likely hepatic
cyst terogeneous perfusion, but correlation with prior imaging
is recommended and if not stable, follow up MRI or CT should be
performed when condition improves.  Nodular and cirrhotic liver.

3.  Moderate amount of ascites.
4.  Edema and wall thickening in the right colon suggestive of
congestive
hepatic colopathy.
5.  Splenic vein and IMV thrombosis extending into the portal
venous
confluence.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for admission
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with h/o colon adenoca, s/p open
sigmoidectomy for colonic adenoca [**2149-6-12**], COPD, DM, EtOH
cirrhosis, who is admitted to the ICU with hypotension, malaise
and failure to thrive.

#. Hypotension: Patient with slightly lower BP than baseline,
which is likely [**2-27**] to acute blood loss given the ongoing blood
in the stool and lower HCT despite diuresis at the rehab. He is
cirrhotic with low platelets, so could have ongoing oozing from
the recent surgery. Patient did not have signs or symptoms
consistent with infection. He was transfused 1 unit PRBCs with
appropriate increase in his HCT to 33. Hct subsequently remained
stable throughout his ICU course. His home diruertics and
nadolol were held throughout ICU course.  At time of callout
from ICU, he was maintaining blood pressures in 90s-100s
systolic.

#. Hyponatremia: The patient was noted to have a sodium of 129
on admission.  This was felt to be reflective of hypovolemic
hyponatremia
