CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-5-7**] 8:57 PM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-7**], 6:57 p.m.:

There has been no increase in left pleural effusion but
consolidation in the left mid and lower lung has increased
substantially, an unusual pattern for first reexpansion
pulmonary edema suggesting instead pulmonary hemorrhage. There
is no pneumothorax. Right lung is clear and heart size is
normal. Minimally displaced fracture of the left seventh rib is
unchanged and may be a second fracture, of the left tenth rib
laterally, chronicity indeterminate.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2174-5-10**] 10:36 AM
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2174-5-9**]:

Previously severe left lung consolidation has improved. A
smaller volume of consolidation remains in the right apex and
perihilar right mid lung. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
probably unchanged over the past several days. Heart size is
normal. There is no pneumothorax.




Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. She underwent chest xray
which revealed no increase in left pleural effusion but
consolidation in the left mid and lower lung which had increased
substantially since last chest radiograph in early [**Month (only) 116**] but no
pneumothorax. She was transferred to the ICU where she was
monitored closely; she was placed on supplemental oxygen. Serial
chest xrays were followed. Interventional Pulmonology was
consulted for Thoracentesis; 2.5 liters was drained from the
left chest. A bronchoscopy was done 2 days later which revealed
patent airways with minimal to no secretions. She was started on
Levaquin for presumed pneumonia.

She is being discharged to home with skilled nursing from
visiting nurses. She will follow up in Surgery clinic in 1 week;
an xray will be [**Month (only) 1988**] prior to this appointment.
