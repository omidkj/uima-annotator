Service:  C-MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old woman with
coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction
times two, with a distant percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral
vascular disease, congestive heart failure with a normal
ejection fraction, history of ovarian cancer, admitted to
C-Medicine [**2178-5-8**], with chest pain for several hours and an
electrocardiogram with diffuse ST elevations and
echocardiogram with mild effusion consistent with
pericarditis.

On [**2178-5-9**], the patient became bradycardic, heart rate 40 to
50 with a decrease in mental status, systolic blood pressure
80s.  The patient was transferred to the CCU.  In the CCU,
Dopamine and Atropine were given and with the Dopamine, the
blood pressure increased to 100 to 110 over 80, no change in
heart rate.  Swan Ganz done at that time revealed right
atrial pressure 15, right ventricle 37/15, pulmonary artery
42/17, pulmonary capillary wedge 22, cardiac output 4.7, SVR
681.

Of note, the patient was found to have white blood cell [**10-30**]
with 91% polys, temperature maximum 100.2.  Chest x-ray with
a question of left lower lobe infiltrate.  She was started on
intravenous Levofloxacin for question of pneumonia.

With relative equalization of right ventricular pulmonary
artery pressures, she was sent to the catheterization
laboratory to rule out tamponade versus ischemia.  Her
coronaries were without significant disease.  Right atrial
pressure was 18, right ventricle 57/14, pulmonary artery
51/14, PCW 25, cardiac output 4.0, cardiac index 2.1.  An
echocardiogram was done which showed a small effusion, no
right atrial, right ventricular collapse.

CT surgery was consulted and they took her to the operating
room for pericardial window with 150 ccs of turbid fluid
removed.  After the procedure, her heart rate went to the
60s, blood pressure 110/40 and without Dopamine.  Mediastinal
drain was placed with small output of about 20 ccs of bloody
fluid.  Of note, on [**2178-5-10**], two units of packed red blood
cells were given for low hematocrit at 27.0 which bumped to
32.0.

9.  Hip fracture on the right.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  She has some prior
history of smoking, no history of alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was sitting comfortably, denied chest pain, complained of
some incisional pain at the mediastinal drain site.
Temperature currently is 98.2, heart rate 64, blood pressure
118/60, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 96% in room
air.  The patient is blind, resting comfortably in no acute
distress.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Respiratory - lungs clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  The abdomen revealed positive bowel
sounds, subxiphoid drain, dressing clean, dry and intact.
Extremities - trace lower extremity edema in the right leg.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.4, hematocrit
27.2, platelets 291,000.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.1, chloride
109, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 46, creatinine 1.2,
glucose 83.  Calcium 9.1, phosphate 3.7, magnesium 2.2.  ALT
117, AST 131.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  During the course of the patient's
hospitalization, heart rate and blood pressure were
controlled by taking her off most of her medications and we
tried to elucidate the etiology of her pericarditis,
investigated for infectious versus rheumatologic versus
neoplastic.

From the pericardial effusion, cultures were sent which were
negative for fungal, bacterial and otherwise gram stain was
negative.  PPD was placed which was negative.

Rheumatologic - [**Doctor First Name **] was done which was negative.  Rheumatoid
factor was negative.  ESR was done which came back at 131
which was consistent with ESR done two years ago which was
140.

Her neoplastic workup considering her history of ovarian
cancer and she had some complaint of chronic abdominal pain,
we had a CT of the abdomen which was negative.  Also, CT of
the chest was negative.

Endocrine workup for the pericarditis, TSH was not elevated
so hypothyroid cause of pericarditis was excluded.

Throughout her hospital course, she also had an issue of
anemia.  In the CCU, her hematocrit was down to 23.0 to 24.0.
They transfused her two units of packed red blood cells and
it went up to 33.0 to 34.0.  After one day, her hematocrit
drifted back down to 27.0.  Another two units of packed red
blood cells were given and it went up to 40.0.  Hematology
was consulted and it was their opinion that the anemia was
most likely a picture of chronic hypoproliferative anemia
with some component of low iron. It was their feeling that
this might likely be due to autoimmune disease.

With stabilization of blood pressure and heart rate and no
proven cause of etiology of pericarditis, the patient is
discharged in stable condition to home with VNA and her
husband.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Constrictive pericarditis versus
restrictive cardiomyopathy with pericardial effusion
requiring a pericardial window.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Insulin U-500 sliding scale as per the patient's
schedule.
