History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo man with history of Parkinson's and COPD is directly
transferred this evening to the SICU at [**Hospital1 18**] from the [**Location 41410**] for further evaluation and management of a
reported large left-sided subdural hematoma with 8 mm midline
shift.  He has had numerous falls over the past year including 3
falls in the week preceding the admission to [**Hospital1 59561**] on [**2160-1-25**].
The patient reportedly has had bilateral lower extremity
weakness
and low back pain limiting ability to walk over past 10 days.
Prior to presentation at [**Location 1268**], he was reportedly
evaluated for falls in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 392**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and had a "negative" head
CT, but with chronic small vessel disease.  Today, right upper
extremity jerking and expressive aphasia were noted by
housestaff, and CT showed the above results.  Neurology consult
there advised giving 1 g fosphenytoin and urgent transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical consult.  Also received 50 g mannitol x
1
there, as recommended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**], [**Hospital1 18**] Neurosurgery
attending.

General: NAD, elderly gentleman
HEENT: sclerae anicteric, somewhat dry MM, no exudates seen in
oropharynx
Neck: reasonably supple, no nuchal rigidity, no bruits
Lungs: decreased breath sounds bilaterally
CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG
Abdomen:  binder in place, soft, obese, non-tender, well healed
midline scar, bowel sounds present
Ext: warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated
Skin: periorbital plaques, possibly psoriatic in nature

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status:
Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, mildly inattentive,
though some component of hearing loss
Oriented to: person, place ("[**Location (un) 86**]"), tunable to understand
response to time
Language: initially fluent, non-dysarthric speech with each
sentence that becomes slowed, slurred and a bit frustrated

Cranial Nerves:
Blinks to threat bilaterally. Pupils: left irregular 4 and
unreactive, right 3 mm and minimally reactive.  Extraocular
movements intact, no nystagmus.  No gaze deviation.  Facial
movement normal and symmetric.  Extensive hearing loss, must
speak at high volume for conversation.  Palate elevates midline.

Tongue protrudes midline, no fasciculations.  Trapezii full
strength bilaterally.

Motor:
Periodic myoclonic jerking of RUE and right foot (5th digit
notable).  Antigravity strength in upper extremities, barely
anti-gravity in lower extremities (just able to pick heels off
bed).  Further testing limited by cooperation.

Sensation: Withdraws appropriately to noxious in all 4
extremities.


Reflexes: B T Br Pa Pl
Right     1 0 0  0  0
Left      1 0 0  0  0
Right toe upgoing, left toe downgoing.

Coordination: Can touch finger to finger in LUE slowly and with
some tremor.  Unable to do so in RUE due to myoclonic jerking.
Can touch toes to examiner's fingers on limited examination of
coordination of lower extremities.

Gait:  Deferred

Pertinent Results:
Data:
Labs, imaging (NCHCT, CXR) here pending
AT [**Hospital1 59561**]:
[**1-25**] Notable WBC 17.2 (69.8 Neuts, 12.6 monos, 4 bands), H/H
14.6/43.3, plt 174, Chem unremarkable except Ca 8.4, AP 130,
vitamin B12 208
[**1-27**] WBC 9.1, H/H 12.4/35.8, K 3.4, albumin 2.9, PTT 29.2, PT
13.6, INR 1.1
CT head at ~530 pm [**1-27**]: shows ~1.4 cm left-sided SDH extending
from frontal lobe to parieto-occipital area, and high along the
convexity; associated with approximately 5.7 mm shift of septum
pellucidum.  There appears to be a mix of acute and more chronic
blood, though resolution is somewhat limited
? lumbar compression fracture at OSH per documents
CXR w/new left sided pleural effusion, no infiltrate, distended
stomach with fluid
EKG NSR with RBBB (old- seen in EKG from [**2150**]), LAD

NCHCT [**1-27**] at 1048 pm:  There is a large left subdural hematoma
extending through the frontal, temporal and parietal regions
with largest width of 12 mm at the level of the thalami.  There
is mild subfalcine herniation with shift of the midline
rightward 5 mm.  There is no evidence of subarachnoid or
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  There is moderate compression of
the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].  There is no hydrocephalus.

There is no evidence of recent infarction. There is a lacunar
infarction in the genu of the left internal capsule.

The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.  There is partial
opacification of the right mastoid air cells.  The left mastoid
air cells are clear.  Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT [**1-28**]:  13-mm left convexity subdural
hematoma is again
identified, not significantly changed from prior exam.  2-mm
rightward shift
of the normally midline structure and associated mass effect
onto the
subjacent sulci and left lateral ventricle is unchanged.  No new
focus of
hemorrhage is identified.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation
is preserved.
No recent infarction is apparent.  Old lacunar infarct is again
identified
within the head of the left caudate.  Visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid
air cells remain normally aerated.

IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of left convexity subdural
hematoma.  No new
hemorrhage is identified.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Large left subdural hematoma surrounding entire hemisphere
with moderate rightward shift of the midline and subfalcine
herniation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service for close
monitoring.  He remained stable. He received dilantin for
seizure control. He had repeat CT that showed stable appearance
of left convexity subdural hematoma, but no new hemorrhage was
identified.  The patient remained under observation and was
clinically stable over the following days.  Seizure activity
stopped and the patient seemed to gain strength in the lower
extremities.  A repeat CT of the head on [**1-30**] appeared stable.

Neurologically, pt with deteriorating mental status and at best
was waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]. Pt became nonverbal, developed Right UE
flaccidity, no eye tracking. Pt began choking on food. Speech
and swallow evaluation indicated pt aspirating on food. Medical
consult  required work up for ?increasing SDH,  d/c'd sedating
meds due to
?delirium, r/o CDiff for diarrhea/leukocytosis, r/o UTI. All
workup was negative.

Extensive family discussion related to pt's diagnosis and
prognosis resulted in redirecting patient's care to comfort
measures only. Family decided against aggressive treatment.

All medications except Tylenol and Morphine bolus' were
discontinued. IV fluid was discontinued. Patient continued to be
offered food with no participation from patient.

Patient transferred to [**Hospital 24356**] [**Hospital **] hospital under hospice care
with family agreement.
