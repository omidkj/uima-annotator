Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2190-6-8**] for symptoms
concerning to C. Difficile colitis megacolon.  A KUB showed
massively dilated colon measuring up to 11 cm which given the
history of C. difficile colitis is concerning for toxic
megacolon.  A CT scan showed diffuse wall thickening seen
throughout the colon consistent with pancolitis, consistent with
patient's known history of C. diff colitis. There is no evidence
of pneumatosis, air in any mesenteric veins, portal venous air,
or free air in the abdomen to suggest ischemic bowel.  Her WBC
was 26 but she was afevrile.  She was admitted to the ICU and
surgery was consulted.  She recieved aggressive fluid
resuscitation, IV Flagyl, and PO/PR Vancomycin.  A CVL was
placed to aid with ICU care.  She was deemed unsafe for an
operation at this point.  She recieved serial abdominal
examinations.  On HD 3, TPN was started.  Her recal tube was
discontinued and she was transferred to the floor.  She was on
maintenance IV fluids.  Her WBC was 19.  Physical therapy saw
her and [**Hospital 22374**] rehab.  On HD 6 she was started on sips.  On
HD 7 she tolerated clears.  On HD 9 she was started on
cholestyramine for diarrhea.  She was started on Linezolid for a
VRE UTI.  On HD 13 she tolerated a regular diet.  On HD 14 her
WBC was 11.  Her TPN was stopped.  On HD 15 she was discharged
to rehab.  By the advice of the ID servce, she was off of all
antibiotics except PO Vancomycin, which she is to take for 7
days.  Flagyl and Linezolid were stopped.  A urine culture from
[**6-19**] grew out Pseudomonas, but a UA from [**6-21**] was negative so ID
did not recommend any treatment.
