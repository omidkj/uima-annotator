CT Torso ([**11-24**]):
1. Grade 3 liver laceration involving the posterior aspect of
the right lobe measuring 6.5 x 3.9 cm in greatest dimension,
with trace perihepatic fluid. No definite evidence of active
extravasation.

2. Right ninth and possibly eleventh rib fractures.

3. Ground-glass nodules in the right lower lobe in a
peribronchial distribution are likely related to
microaspiration, though early bronchopneumonia could have this
appearance. Followup imaging should be obtained if clinically
warranted.

4. More solid-appearing nodules at the right lung base measuring
5 mm and in the right upper lobe measuring 4 mm, of uncertain
etiology. Recommend follow- up Chest CT in [**7-12**] months to ensure
stability.

CT Head ([**11-24**]):
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or skull fracture.

CT C-spine ([**11-24**]):
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
