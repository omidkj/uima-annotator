ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  The patient is an 80
year-old female who presented initially for surgical
evaluation after having a workup for postprandial abdominal
pain, which found a gastric mass on gastrointestinal series.
CT subsequently revealed a large gastric mass with increased
soft tissue density within the transverse colon.  The patient
subsequently had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed
a submucosal infiltrative circumferential mass of malignant
appearance in the antrum and stomach body pathology of which
showed an adenocarcinoma of the signet ring cell type with
chronic inactive gastritis.  The patient therefore was
evaluated for a subtotal versus total gastrectomy.  On
initial presentation her weight was 116 pounds.  She was
otherwise afebrile.  HEENT was unremarkable.  The neck was
supple without mass, nodules or thyromegaly.  The chest was
clear to auscultation and percussion.  The heart sounds were
regular, but there was notably a grade 2 to 3 systolic
ejection murmur heard best at the left sternal border that
radiates up into the carotids with minor radiation to the
axilla.  The abdomen was soft with an upper abdominal mass,
which was consistent with the distal stomach, which felt
firm.  There is a well healed lower midline scar.  There were
no other masses.  There was no ascites and the extremities
showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  There was mild to
moderate tremor noted to be present.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Her preoperative hematocrit was
36.2.  Preoperative platelet count was 466.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2139-12-15**] and on that same day underwent a total gastrectomy with
placement of a feeding jejunostomy without note of
intraoperative complications.  Intraoperatively it was noted
that there was a large tumor of the stomach, which was of
lienitis plastica type, which involved mostly the distal
stomach, but notably the lesser curvature of the stomach was
also involved without lymphatic - type invasion, which made a
subtotal gastrectomy impossible.  The celiac access was noted
to be quite firm, but there were no obvious liver mets.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the
Operating Room and taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in
stable condition.  Notably the patient is a Jehovah's
witness. She refused any sort of transfusion of blood
products, therefore there was a concern of any sort of
bleeding that the patient might encounter.  Postoperatively
her hematocrit was 29, which the patient was tolerating well
with satisfactory O2 saturation and no other evidence of
tachycardia or hypoxia.  In the initial postoperative phase
she was mildly volume depleted for which she was hydrated
resulting in good urine output.  Blood draws were minimized
in the postoperative period in order to avoid over
phlebotomizing the patient.

1.  Neurologically:  Her pain was initially controlled with
an epidural, which was subsequently discontinued and she was
switched over to intravenous pain medications followed by po
pain medications without any sort of difficulty.  She did
notably experience some mental status changes, which seemed
to resolve after treatment for urinary tract infection she
had postoperatively and also reduction in the patient's
narcotics.

2.  Respiratory:  The patient had persistent O2 requirement
several days after surgery.  The chest x-ray revealed
bilateral pleural effusions, but it was deemed that
thoracentesis would not be indicated in her case.  Therefore
she was diuresed somewhat with the subsequent improvement in
her respiratory function.  At the time of discharge she did
have moderate bilateral pleural effusions, but was satting in
the mid 90% on room air.

3.  Cardiac:  The patient did develop some postoperative
atrial fibrillation with rates as high in the 150s.  She was
ruled for myocardial infarction with the serial cardiac
enzymes.  Her postoperative atrial fibrillation initially did
not respond to intravenous Lopressor and did require Cardizem
drips for which the patient was placed in the Intensive Care
Unit.  These episodes had resolved two to three days prior to
discharge at which time the patient remained in sinus rhythm
and was placed on po Cardizem and Amiodarone.  She did also
require Amiodarone in the Intensive Care Unit.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient actually did well.  Her
upper gastrointestinal study on postoperative day six
evidenced no leak or stricture.

5.  Nutrition:  The patient was on her goal tube feeds of
ProMod 3/4 strength at 80 an hour during the last several
days prior to discharge.  In addition to this she was being
given post gastrectomy diet, which she was tolerating without
any nausea or vomiting.  She had received a vitamin B-12 shot
and was receiving supplemental iron.

6.  Renal function:  Her BUN and creatinine were fairly
stable and were 35 and 1.0.  At the time of the patient's
discharge she was making good urine.  She was diuresed as
needed with Lasix secondary to volume shifts from the
postoperative fluid that she had received in order to avoid
any sort of volume overload.

7.  Hematology:  In order to stimulate the patient's
erythropoietin she was started on Epogen 40,000 units three
times per week.  This was discontinued prior to discharge.

8.  Infectious disease:  The patient's only postoperative
complication was a urinary tract infection, which was treated
with Levofloxacin and discontinuation of the Foley.

By postoperative day nine the patient had been afebrile and
had remained in sinus rhythm for several days and otherwise
with good blood pressures and had been making excellent urine
and tolerating a post gastrectomy diet without difficulty.
Therefore it was determined that she would be appropriate for
discharge to rehabilitation facility.  Physical therapy had
seen the patient and cleared her for this.  When the patient
was discharged she was to continue her tube feeds of Promote
with fiber at 3/4 strength at 80 cc an hour to meet her
caloric needs and this would be in addition to the post
gastrectomy diet, which she could take.  Otherwise the
patient will need q monthly vitamin B-12 shots and also
supplementation of iron.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Iron sulfate liquid.
2.  Sinemet 25/100 take one tab po t.i.d.
3.  _______________ 5 mg take one tablet po b.i.d.
4.  Lescol 40 mg po q.d.
5.  Avandamet 4/500 one tablet po q.d.
6.  Amiodarone 400 mg po b.i.d.
7.  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.
8.  Diltiazem 30 mg po q.i.d.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to rehab in
good condition.
