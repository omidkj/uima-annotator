HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male with
known peripheral vascular disease and diabetes type 2 along
with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with
an ejection fraction of 30% that presented on [**2191-1-5**], for chronic ischemic changes in his right leg with a
right foot ulcer. He had been having this for some time and
had increase in difficulty in walking and was only able to
ambulate short distances due to pain, especially worse in his
right leg and his calf. He had also had this ulcer for
several months now that was nonhealing in nature.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was with
stable vital signs in no apparent distress. He had no neck
bruits. He was in regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops. His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. His abdomen was obese and he was nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds, was soft and nontender
throughout. His right foot was noted to be cool with a right
heel ulcer that appeared slightly necrotic in nature. It did
not have any gross pus or significant erythema around it but
it had been nonhealing for some time. His signals were
faintly dopplerable in the right foot, but he did have good
femoral pulses at this time in the bilateral groins.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2191-1-5**], the patient was
brought to the operating room on the day of admission and
underwent the right iliofemoral endarterectomy with Dacron
patch, right common iliac artery stent graft, right external
iliac artery stent graft and a right SFA angioplasty x2. The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be
extubated after the procedure, however, he did require
emergent hemodialysis afterwards and was transferred to the
surgical intensive care unit. The dialysis was done here
because he needed a high level of monitoring during this with
a history of congestive heart failure. He remained in the
intensive care unit until postoperative day 2 when he was
able to receive a floor bed. There, he progressed well and
had another round of hemodialysis and was noted to be fit for
discharge on [**2191-1-9**], postoperative day #4. He is
stable at this time with plans to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and to call to schedule an appointment. He was followed
closely by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] of nephrology who plans to maintain
him on his Monday, Wednesday, Friday dialysis schedule.
