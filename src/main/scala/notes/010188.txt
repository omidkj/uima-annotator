Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of stage
IV COPD on 4L home O2, history of paradoxical embolic stroke,
factor V Leiden heterozygosity and PFO, diastolic CHF, and
dyslipidemia, who presents with hypoxia. Patient states that
over the past few weeks, he has had hypoxia to the 70's on 4LNC,
though he was asymptomatic at this time. This AM, VNA noted him
to be 68% on 4L NC with ambulation, and at this time patient
notes that he was quite short of breath. He denied any
dizziness/lightheadedness at this time. Denied any chest pain or
palpitations.
.
Patient denies any fevers or cough, and denies wheezing. He
states that he does not have significant baseline cough. He
denies sick contacts or recent viral infections. He was was
hospitalized in [**2113-11-7**], when he was intubated for a short
period of time. He was discharged on [**2113-11-17**] and completed a
prednisone taper on [**2113-11-29**]. He has not required steroids since
that time. He can walk across the room when granted enough time
to stop and catch his breath (documented that in [**11-15**] could
walk about 300ft before these symptoms). He uses as cane at
baseline, but a wheelchair when he leaves the house to get to
doctor's appointments.
.
In [**11-15**] he was noted to have a baseline weight of 184 pounds.
He is now 198 pounds and feels that it is "all fluid." He has
had progressive swelling in his legs, for which he was
uptitrated on his lasix dose from 40mg daily to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. The
swelling in his legs has recently improved on this regimen. He
takes his medications without fail. He does not adhere to PO
fluid restriction, but does attempt to maintain a low salt diet
as much as possible. Denies orthopnea or PND. States he could
lie flat without worsening of his SOB. His sleep is interrupted
only by nocturia, which he states is [**1-9**] taking lasix before
going to sleep. He is unaware of apneic episodes he may
experience at night. He notes fatigue and drinks a great deal of
coffee.
.
Patient has had extensive workup by pulmonary (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**]
and is currently undergoing a workup by the Sleep specialists.
As per most recent note, it was unclear of the accuracy of pulse
ox readings and patient noted to have oxygen sats of 85% 4
liters ([**Last Name (un) 69130**] finger probe) vs 89%4 liters oxygen (ear probe),
consistent with ABG drawn simultaneously on 4 liters on [**2114-2-15**].
[**2113-11-20**] overnight oximetry demonstrated average oxygen sats of
93-96% on 50% venti face mask, and 2 minutes 50 seconds with
SpO2<89%. He is undergoing evaluation for the utility of
nocturnal noninvasive ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory
failure secondary to COPD and ?component of OSA.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.9, 103, 131/76, 16, 97% on 4L
NC. CXR was done and showed no edema or infiltrate. He received
30 mg IV solumedrol, combivent, azithromycin x1, and magnesium.
His vitals upon transfer to the floor were HR 101, BP 108/58, RR
18, O2 sat 97% on 4L NC.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI, also positive for nocturia, snoring at night (but
no witnessed apnea)
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied new cough. Denied
chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias.


Past Medical History:
1. COPD, largely emphysema, FEV1 17%, status post right upper

6. Hyperlipidemia.
7. Inguinal hernia.

10. Eczema.
11. Colonic polyps.
12. Dyslipidemia


Social History:
Worked as a security guard (vs computer scientist) at [**University/College **]
library, now no longer working. Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 3307**] and

occasionally uses cane at home). Has two grown children,

CXR [**2114-2-21**]:
The lungs are hyperexpanded with biapical lucencies
and bibasilar fibrosis, consistent with COPD. The hila are again
prominent, consistent with known adenopathy. There is no focal
consolidation or edema.  There are no pleural effusions or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: COPD, no acute changes.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT [**2114-2-21**]:
No left lower extremity DVT
.
TTE [**2114-2-23**]:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse.
No color-low Doppler evidence of significant right-to-left
shunting at atrial level.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2113-8-3**], no definite change seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of
stage IV COPD on 4L home O2, history of paradoxical embolic
stroke, factor V Leiden heterozygosity and PFO, diastolic CHF,
and dyslipidemia, who presented with chronic hypercarbic
respiratory failure.

#  Chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypoxia [**1-9**] COPD
Flare: Patient initially recieved IV solumedrol which was
switched to oral prednisone 60 mg daily on Day 2.  However given
lack of improvement, his steriods was switched to IV solumedrol
80 mg IV q8h on HOD# 5.  He continued to get standing nebs q3h.
He also recieved azithromycin for 5 days.  He was also written
for xopenex prn.  We appreciated Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 575**] and pulmonary team
recommendations.  Repeat TTE with bubble study did not show any
significant shunt ([**1-9**] PFO) physiology con
