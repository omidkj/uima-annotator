Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Sulfamethoxazole

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for concern of CVA, mental status changes


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
89yoF with PMH HTN, afib, HL, CAD s/p CABG who presents from
[**Hospital 8125**] Hospital with reported transient R arm weakness and
inability to speak at 2:30pm.  Per her daughter she was standing
next to her eating when all of a sudden she jerked out her left
arm and stiffened her shoulders.  Her daughter sat her on a
chair and tried to get her to spit out the food but she
continued to chew and swallowed her food.  Her daughter felt
that she was able to understand her but was having trouble
speaking.  At that point her daughter called 911 and she was
taken to [**Hospital3 **].  At [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital, she was lethargic
and there was concern for CVA (per her daughter was awake and
moving all extremities prior to anti-emetics), also in the
setting of HTN to systolic BP's 230-260's and N/V. She did
receive labetalol and 1" nitropaste, reglan/zofran at the OSH
before she arrived at the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
.
On presentation to our ER, VS 98.0 78 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 88914**]% 4L NC. She
was noted to be somnolent, but following commands with no
lateralizing symptoms. She had severe N/V. CT head showed no
ICH. EKG was sinus rhythm w/ RBBB with no signs of ischemia;
there was RBBB (unchanged from prior). CXR showed Moderate pulm
congestion with bibasilar opacities and edema; Trace b/l
effusions difficult to exclude. Cardiac silhouette normal.
Initially she was not given any medications as the thought was
that she was having an ischemic stroke and that she needed to
autoregulate her BP. Troponin was noted to be elevated at 0.17
(which was elevated from troponin <0.01). She had leukocytosis
to 14.8. She was given heparin and started on nitro gtt, as well
as ASA. She got 1L NS. On transfer to the ICU, VS 98, 77,
166/64, 20, 96RA.
.
On the floor, initial VS were: 78, 183/66, 17 and 94% on RA.
She is able to open her eyes and follow commands, denies any
current complaints.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2166-5-5**] CT Head:
FINDINGS: No evidence of acute hemorrhage, mass effect, midline
shift, or
acute large vascular territorial infarct is seen. Please note
the patient's head is rotated in the gantry. Prominence of the
sulci and ventricles is consistent with global atrophy.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are
most consistent with sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic
change. Tiny left basal ganglia lacunes are noted. There are
vascular calcifications along the cavernous portions of the
carotid arteries and of the vertebral arteries. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are clear. No acute
fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Chest X-Ray:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar opacities, raising concern for infection and/or
aspiration
depending on the clinical situation with possible component of
edema.
Pulmonary vascular congestion.

ECHO:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF 70%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is
a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral
stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a high right
atrial pressure.]



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 88915**] is an 89 year-old female with PMH of HTN, afib,
HL, CAD s/p CABG who presents from OSH with possible transient R
arm weakness, somnolence, hypertensive emergency with pulmonary
edema and elevated troponin.
.
.
# Altered mental status / CVA: Unclear etiology of AMS, possibly
[**1-22**] antiemetics (zofran/reglan she received at OSH for N/V).
Initial concern was for CVA, but CT on admission showed no
evidence of infarct. [**Month (only) 116**] also be related to her hypertensive
emergency, as improvement with BP control is also reassuring.
Patient's mental status improved during MICU stay. A repeat head
CT was obtained which did show expanding infarcts in the
distribution of the PCA and superior cerebellar artery. Heparin
drip was not started because patient did not wish to be on
longterm anticoagulation. She was transferred to the neurology
serivce for further management.
Discussion was held with the patient regarding anticoagulation.
She has refused coumadin and aspirin in the past and continued
to refuse.  We are trying the patient on dibigatran.  Aspirin
was used during her hospital course and was stopped at
discharge.
.
# Hypertensive emergency: Unclear precipitant of severe
hypertension. Patient with pulmonary edema on CXR, troponin leak
(though no EKG changes, it is difficult to determine since she
is paced).  Volume overload is likely due to flash pulmonary
edema in the setting of hypertension.  Her mental status changes
could also be due to extreme hypertension, as this has also
improved with improvement in her blood pressure.  Patient was
started on nitro gtt to SBP in the 160's, which is where her
blood pressure has been as an outpatient. She was transitioned
to PO regimen with metoprolol, labetolol, and valsartan and BP
was well controlled <160/90.  Valsartan was in
