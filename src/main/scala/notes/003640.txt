CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year-old
female with no past medical history who presented for an
initial visit with outpatient oncologist on [**2148-11-27**].  Her
pertinent oncologic history began eight months ago when she
noticed a lump in her right breast.  She did not seek medical
attention until [**Month (only) 1096**] due to desire to spare her family
pain of dealing with cancer.  The patient's family recently
lost a son to [**Name (NI) **] sarcoma six years ago.  The patient
finally sought medical attention when her back pain became
too severe to ignore.  The patient's back pain had begun in
[**Month (only) 216**] and waxed and waned over the fall.  The patient saw
her primary care nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3639**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7749**] at the
[**Hospital 14840**] Health Center and was referred to a surgeon.  The
patient underwent excisional breast biopsy on [**2148-11-18**]
revealing an infiltrating carcinoma grade 3 out of 3 with a
lobular component, ER positive, HER-2/neu negative.  Bone
scan done one week ago shows uptake in multiple ribs and
vertebral bodies as well as lighter areas of uptake in the
right femur and right hip.  Formal report of this study is
not available.  The patient's family reports that her pain
control had been very inadequate and they had been up with
her q one hour giving her breakthrough liquid Oxycodone in
addition to a Fentanyl patch, which has been up from 25 to 75
over the last two weeks.  They also report that her breathing
has become labored and she has not eaten anything and taking
only liquids for two weeks as well.  The patient has had
sweats, but no fevers, headache, no bowel movements for one
week.  The patient has been essentially bedridden since last
Thursday.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Benign breast biopsy twenty years ago.

MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl patch 75 micrograms, Oxycodone for
breakthrough pain, Zantac liquid b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married with three living children.  Son
died six years ago from [**Doctor First Name **] sarcoma.  The patient has a 100
pack year history of tobacco.  Previously drank three to four
beers per day, but none since [**2148-11-2**].  The patient
worked as a teacher and then stayed home with the kids.
Recently was working as a retail store manager.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.2.  Pulse 100.  Blood

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 8.4, hematocrit 39.3,
platelets 328, PT 13.9, INR 1.3, PTT 27.7, sodium 126,
potassium 4.4, chloride 83, bicarb 32, BUN 13, creatinine
0.3, ALT 15, AST 31, LDH 479, alkaline phosphatase 132,
total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 2.9, calcium 9.3, CEA 24,
CA27-29 pending.

IMAGING:  Head CT from [**2148-11-29**] showed no intracranial
metastases with possible cystic lung lesions.  Chest CT from
[**2148-11-29**] showed bolus emphysema, small bilateral pleural
effusions.  No metastasis.  Spinal MR from [**2148-12-1**] showed
multiple areas of metastatic disease in the cervical,
thoracic and lumbar spine.  No evidence of cord compression.
Mild pathologic compression fracture of T3 and T6, bilateral
small pleural effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was in moderate
respiratory distress on arrival with an O2 sat of 80% on room
air that increased to 94% on 4 liters.  The patient was also
given significant amount of narcotics as well as
benzodiazepines for pain and anxiety.  The patient became
more lethargic and arterial blood gases showed hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  The patient was intubated on the floor
and taken to the _________ Intensive Care Unit.  The patient
initially got a single dose of Azithromycin in the Intensive
Care Unit and remained on the ventilator until she self
extubated on [**2148-12-1**].  The patient did well with multiple
Atrovent and Albuterol nebulizers.  Flovent was added to her
pulmonary regimen.  The patient remained extubated and did
well and was transferred to the floor.  Pulmonary function
tests will be obtained on [**2148-12-5**] to assess her emphysema.
A chest CT showed large bolus emphysema.  The patient has a
long significant history of smoking.  Will schedule Ms. [**Known lastname **]
with outpatient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] in the Pulmonary
Department.  Tolerated O2 sat at 92% given patient's tendency
to retain CO2.  Also need to avoid increasing her narcotics
or giving her any benzodiazepines given her propensity to
retain CO2.

2.  Oncologic:  The patient has significant skeletal
metastases of her breast cancer.  The patient was started on
Arimidex and given pamidronate in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient will continue on Rumidex for hormonal treatment
of her breast cancer and will receive monthly doses of
pamidronate.  The patient will follow up with her Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26065**]
her oncologist in one month for dose of Pamidronate and to
assess the effectiveness of the Arimidex.

3.  Pain:  The patient's pain was better controlled after her
Intensive Care Unit stay when her Fentanyl patch was
increased to 100.  She was on low dose NSIR for breakthrough.
In addition, will add NSAIDS for breakthrough pain Ibuprofen
600 mg t.i.d.  Any changes in her narcotics should be
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26065**] her primary oncologist.  Should
avoid increasing her narcotics due to her demonstrated
ability to retain CO2 and develop hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  If the patient's pain again becomes difficult to
manage will consider palliative radiation therapy, but at
this time there is no acute indication for radiation therapy
given no evidence of sinal cord compression.
