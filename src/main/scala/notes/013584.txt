Service:

The anticipated date of discharge is [**2128-9-30**].  This
dictation will cover the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course on the
Medicine Wards following her Medical Intensive Care Unit
stay.  The patient was transferred on [**9-19**], following
a Medical Intensive Care Unit course for hypotension,
urosepsis, acute renal failure and myocardial infarction.

The patient is a 59 year old female with a complex medical
history, namely, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
paraplegia secondary to epidural abscess, vertebral
osteomyelitis in early [**2127**], associated with a Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis,
history of Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcers, recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**8-28**], on Vancomycin, Bactrim and Ciprofloxacin.
Cultures from sacrum grew out Proteus, E. coli and
Acinetobacter.  She was readmitted on [**9-12**] with
fevers, decreased mental status, decreased urine output and
p.o. intake, and generalized failure to thrive.

She was found to be hypotensive in the Emergency Room with
blood pressures in the low 70s, acute renal failure thought
secondary to prerenal picture and Vancomycin toxicity, and
was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for presumed
sepsis; the patient was on pressors in the Intensive Care
Unit.

From a cardiovascular standpoint in the Intensive Care Unit,
the patient was started on Levophed, aggressive intravenous
fluids, several packed units of red blood cells, and was
treated empirically with Zosyn for presumed urosepsis and
sacral decubitus ulcer sepsis.  The patient showed
improvement but on [**9-14**], had episodes of
hypotension and hypoxia with right facial twitching and at
this point had ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a
subsequent echocardiogram showing global anterior septal
akinesis status hypokinesis and found on EKG to have an
anterior septal myocardial infarction with positive troponin
and CPKs.

The patient was medically managed with aspirin and was not
given heparin since she had a questionable history of heparin
induced thrombocytopenia antibody and also a history of
cerebral aneurysms and unable to medically manage with beta
blockers since history of severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and low blood pressures.

The patient was subsequently weaned off Levophed but was
thought to have been in congestive heart failure and was
diuresed several liters of fluid.

Meanwhile from a pulmonary standpoint, the patient had a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and then had
the episode of hypoxia and subsequently was intubated on the
23rd, extubated on the 26th and was able to be saturating on
nasal cannula by time of discharge to the floor.  It was an
unclear etiology of her hypoxia.  Congestive heart failure on
her chest x-ray and CT scan with granular densities in the
right upper lobe and left upper lobe.

From a neurological standpoint, the patient had a history of
a cerebellar cerebrovascular accident with aneurysm and had
episodes of facial twitching with her decreased blood
pressures and hypoxia on the 23rd.  She had been evaluated by
Neurology and had a negative head CT scan, but was restarted
on Dilantin for her history of seizure disorder.  The patient
has had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit which had improved by the time of her
transfer to the floor.

In addition, the patient had been followed by Infectious
Disease for urosepsis but ended up growing out a Klebsiella
pneumoniae, ESBL, also funguria and had been treated with
Meropenem and Fluconazole.  The patient's acute renal failure
was thought, as mentioned above, secondary to prerenal versus
Vancomycin toxicity and had resolved by time of her discharge
onto the floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2,
presumed to be two liters.
2.  Presumed coronary artery disease status post anterior
septal myocardial infarction in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.

artery and right middle carotid artery.
5.  History of hypernatremia.

T9 region, status post laminectomy in this region.

11. Questionable history of congestive heart failure with 30%
on the [**9-16**] in the setting of recent myocardial
infarction.

ALLERGIES:   Baclofen, and as mentioned above, heparin
induced thrombocytopenia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the floor, she was
afebrile at 96.5 F., temperature; blood pressure 94/53; pulse
110, respiratory rate of 20; saturation of 98% on two liters.
The patient's examination was significant for a tachycardia
with a regular rate and rhythm, and decreased breath sounds
bilaterally with bilateral crackles, right greater than left.
Her belly was nondistended, nontender, but had active bowel
sounds.  She had no edema in her lower extremities.  She has
a Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer with some evidence of
fibrinous exudate at the superior aspects of her wound, but
no evidence of frank pus.

LABORATORY:  Her laboratory work on transfer was white blood
cell count of 9.4, hematocrit 33.1, platelets of 445.  She
had a sodium count of 145, potassium 4.0, chloride of 108,
bicarbonate of 32, BUN of 7, creatinine of 0.4, glucose of
104.  Her calcium was 7.0, magnesium was 1.0, phosphorus 1.5,
albumin was 2.5.

She had an echocardiogram from the 25th which showed an
ejection fraction of 30%, change from 60% in [**2128-7-23**],
which demonstrated anterior septal hypokinesis and akinesis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  NEUROLOGY:  As mentioned in the HPI, the patient while in
the Medical Intensive Care Unit had this episode of right
facial twitching.  She had a history of cerebral aneurysms
and a questionable history of seizure disorder.  She had been
followed by the Neurology Team and had been loaded on
Dilantin while in the Intensive Care Unit.  She was continued
on this Dilantin and will continue on Dilantin after
discharge.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A) While in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient had ruled in for a myocardial infarction based upon
EKG changes which was thought to be an anterior septal
myocardial infarction with positive CK and troponin.  The
patient had been medically managed in the Intensive Care Unit
secondary to question of heparin antibody and low blood
pressures.  Her echocardiogram following myocardial
infarction had shown an ejection fraction of 30%.

On the floor, the patient was continued to be medically
managed with an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker as her blood
pressures tolerated.  She was continued on aspirin.  She had
a follow-up echocardiogram that showed complete resolution of
these changes.  Her ejection fraction was increased from 30%
to 60% with known wall motion abnormalities as had been seen
on previous echocardiogram.  At this point, it was thought
that the primary changes from the myocardial infarction that
she suffered in the Medical Intensive Care Unit which is
probably secondary to some type of supply ischemia.  She may
have been possibly suffering from a stunned myocardium.

For the remainder of her hospital course, she was continued
on aspirin and a low dose ACE inhibitor.  Discussions will be
held with the primary attending to determine whether the
patient will need to be continued on this as an outpatient.

B) Congestive heart failure:  As mentioned above, the patient
was thought to be in mild heart fa
