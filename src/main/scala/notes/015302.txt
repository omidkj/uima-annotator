History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 55087**] is a 84F with PMH of CAD, hypertension, dCHF, asthma
on prednisone who was noted to be hypotensive with sbp80s in
cardiologist's office.  Patient endorsed mild fatigue and
baseline exertional dyspnea, but was otherwise asymptomatic. She
uses her asthma medications on these days and feels better. She
otherwise denies chest pain, orthopnea, PND, leg edema,
lightheadedness, syncope and palpitations.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 96.7 64 110/79 16 100%. EKG was
unchanged from prior. Labs were significant for creatinine 1.5
(baseline 0.6), HCT 33 (baseline 30). UA was unremarkable. Blood
cultures and urine cultures were sent. Troponin was <0.01. On
CXR, there was concern for possible pna and she was started on
cefepime and azithromycin. while in the ED, her systolic BP
dropped to 62/34. She was given 4 L NS.  VS on transfer to the
MICU were T 97.4, P: 63, BP: 91/42, RR: 16, O2Sat: 100, RA.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
Ms. [**Known lastname 55087**] is a 84F with PMH of CAD, hypertension, dCHF, asthma
on chronic prednisone, who was found to be hypotensive to 62/34
in the ED.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
#Hypotension: Patient presented to her cardiologist for routine
follow-up and was found to have systolic BP in the 80s.  She
felt mildly fatigued and had baseline dyspnea on exertion.  She
denied chest pain, dizziness, confusion.  Also denied cough,
fever, chills, dysuria, diarrhea, or other signs of infection.
CXR was clear and UA only had 2 WBCs. Differential for
hypotension included cardiogenic, septic, hypovolemic or
distributive from adrenal insufficiency (patient on chronic
steroids for asthma).  She did not appear to be in heart
failure, thus leading to low suspicion of cardiogenic process.
EKG was unchanged and cardiac enzymes in ICU were trended and
remained negative. Patient also had no infectious symptoms to
suggest sepsis.  An AM cortisol was checked and returned
appropriately low at 4.4 (her adrenals have been suppressed by
exogenous steroids).  Acute kidney injury and mild
hemoconcentration suggests hypovolemia to be the etiology of her
hypotension, possibly in the setting of BP meds persisting
secondary to renal failure, and aggressive diuresis. After
receiving 3L NS in the ED, she became normotensive and remained
normotensive in the ICU.  She received no more fluids while in
the ICU and metoprolol, enalapril, and lasix were held.  She was
monitored on telemetry with no events.  Endocrine consult does
not believe adrenal insufficiency led to hypotension.  Per PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was kept on prednisone 10mg daily because had asthma
attack when was tapered to 7.5mg. PT  cleared patient to go home
with home PT (patient initially desatted to 87% on RA while
walking, but sounded wheezy and O2 sat came up quickly after
resting, but on repeat the next day, patient did not desat while
walking and maintained 97% on RA).  After discussion with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **], patient will be put back on lasix 20mg daily and
enalapril 5mg daily.  She should monitor her bp at home and will
f/u with him as outpatient.

#Acute kidney injury: On admission, creatinine was elevated to
1.5 from baseline 1.1, likely secondary to volume depletion from
diuretics. UA was negative for UTI. She received 3L NS in the ED
and repeat Cr in the morning was back to baseline 1.1.
Diuretics and ACEi were held in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].  Creatinine
was trended with daily improvement.  Lasix was restarted prior
to discharge, and patient was notified to restart enalapril at a
lower 5mg dose 5 days after discharge.

#Adrenal Insufficiency.  This is secondary to chronic prednisone
therapy and AM cortisol is appropriately low.  Patient was
informed she should have a medical alert bracelet notifying
people she has adrenal insufficiency from prednisone use (should
she ever become very ill, she may need extra prednisone).  She
should get outpatient bone mineral density test, and should
change calcium carbonate to calcium citrate since she is also on
PPI and absorption may not be as good for carbonate in the
setting of low acidity.

#Asthma: Patient has had multiple asthma exacerbations and is
now on long-term oral prednisone 10 mg po daily. When she was
tapered to 7.5mg, she had an exacerbation requiring
hospitalization.  She was continued on home prednisone as well
as ipratroprium and albuterol inhalers.  No wheezing was noted
during hospitalization, and no sign of asthma exacerbation
during this hospitalizaiton.

#Diastolic CHF: Patient appeared euvolemic on exam after fluid
resuscitation in ED, and had no pulmonary crackles and normal
CXR on admission. Per outpatient cardiologist, prior to
discharge, she was restarted on lasix 20mg, enalapril at a lower
dose of 5mg.  Metoprolol and spironolactone were discontinued.

# Constipation: Patient is chronically constipated and usually
has a bowel movement q3-5 days.
