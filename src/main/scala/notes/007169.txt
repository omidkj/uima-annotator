Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 31014**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left heart catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3321**] is a 67 year-old female with a significant
history for COPD, HTN, as well as recent abnormal stress on
[**2138-12-25**] who presented in severe respiratory distress, on BiPAP
by EMS to [**Location (un) 620**] ED. BiPAP was continued in the emergency
department. Patient was given Solu-Medrol, nebs, magnesium.
Chest x-ray obtained immediately and was initially concerning
for pneumonia therefore patient was started on Levaquin and
vancomycin. However, after comaprison with previous CXR, opacity
was thought most likely [**1-8**] CHF. Therefore she was started on a
nitro drip. EKG showed sinus tach normal axis QTC 510, no STEMI.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after patient improved and came
off BiPAP. This AM she underwent cardiac cath where she was
found to have 70-80% occlusion LCx at OM bifurcation, and
proximal 30-40% LCx lesion, with no other significant stenoses.
DES was placed to LCx. On cath she was also found to have
elevated left-sided pressures (LVEDP 30), therefore will require
diuresis. However as she received 150cc IV contrast during cath,
she is now receiving 500mL NS @50cc/hr as well as Lasix 20mg IV.

.
The patient describes intermittent dyspnea on exertion, i.e.
climbing up and down the stairs or when feeling anxious. She
recalls one isolated episode of chest discomfort that occurred
at rest several weeks ago, described as a burning substernally,
lasting several minutes before resolving spontaneously. Uses
mutiple pillows at baseline.
.
Recently in the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**], the patient was
hospitalized for flash pulmonary edema at BIDN. At that time,
she was ruled out for ACS and was provided with lasix and bipap,
which greatly helped her symptoms. At that time, BP's were noted
to be in the 160-220 range. BNP was 5314. As part of her
evaluation she underwent an echo which revealed normal LV
function. Stress testing was completed where she was only able
to exercise 2.5 minutes, stopping due to dyspnea and wheezing.
Imaging revealed possible anterior ischemia. She went home on
her usual atenolol dose of 150 mg qd and with the addition of
lisinopril 10 mg qd. In retrospect, she denies having had any
exertional chest pain and dyspnea in recent months. However,
during an admission to BIDHN in [**2138-10-7**] for a pneumonia,
she reports having a similar, but less intense episode of acute
dyspnea.
.
Her risk factors for CAD include hypertension, current cigarette

smoking (50+ pack-years total), and a family history of CAD
(maternal uncle with MI in his 60's). Her LDL on [**2138-12-15**] was 62.
Her other history is notable for COPD, a pulmonary nodule,
anxiety/depression, and EtOH excess.
.
On admission to the ED, HR was 86, BP 105/81, RR 20, 97% 2 L,
temp 99. Pt did not report and CP or SOB. Trop was 0.04 and BNP
was 4501. She had an unremarkable Chem 7 and CBC. Lactate was
elevated at 4.9. Given question of RLL infiltrate, respiratory
distress, and elevated lactate, she was transferred to the MICU
for question of pneumosepsis. In the MICU, patient remained
stable. She c/o dyspnea but was not hypoxic. Nitro gtt was
started. After cath this AM, she was transferred to the CCU for
monitoring.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2138-12-30**] - Normal LV function. Aortic
sclerosis, mild concentric LVH, LA enlargement
.
ETT: [**2138-12-25**] - 2.5 minutes [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, 61% max PHR, stopping
due
to shortness of breath and wheezing. Nonspecific EKG changes
noted. Imaging: LVEF 78% with normal wall motion. Possible focal

mid anterior ischemia noted at low level exercise. Evidence of
increased LV filling pressure noted during exercise.
.
CARDIAC CATH ([**2139-1-7**]): 70-80% LCx occlusion at OM bifurcation.
30-40% proximal LCx occlusion. No other significant stenoses.
DES placed to LCx. Elevated left-sided pressures (LVEDP 30).
.
ECHO ([**2139-1-8**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Patient has h/o angina, HTN, and
smoking. On admission she had no EKG changes or significantly
elevated cardiac enzymes. She is now s/p cardiac cath which
showed 70-80% LCx occlusion at OM bifurcation, and 30-40%
proximal LCx occlusion. DES was placed to LCx. Patient also
found to have elevated left-sided pressures (LV
