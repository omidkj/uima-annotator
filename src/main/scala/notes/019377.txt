Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
palpitations


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 56F with a hx of pulmonary HTN, OSA, obesity
hypoventilation sydrome on BIPAP and home O2 who presents with a
transient episode of palpitations this afternoon.  The patient
reports that she had been in her USOH.  She was watching
television for 2 hours when she stood up and started
experiencing palpitations and shortness of breath.  Her family
called EMS.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient's vitals were as follows T 98.8,
BP 120/70, HR 80, R 24, O2 sat 90% RA.  The patient received
combivent nebs, prednisone 40mg, levaquin 500mg IV and lasix
80IV (750cc output).  A CXR was done which showed cardiomegaly
and pulmonary HTN w/o pulmonary vascular congestion or
consolidation.  The patient reports that since being here she
has not had recurrence of the palpitations.  Her breathing feels
fine.

.
CXR [**2122-1-19**]: Cardiomegaly and pulmonary arterial hypertension
without
pulmonary vascular congestion or focal consolidation.
.
CTA CHEST 1/22/7:
1.  Evaluation for pulmonary embolism severely limited due to
patient motion. No evidence of saddle embolus or first-order
branch PEs.
2.  Cardiomegaly.
3.  Mosaic-like ground-glass opacities which could be indicative
of reactive airway disease.
.
TTE [**2122-1-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Due to suboptimal image quality,
right ventricular function cannot be reliably assessed. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2119-11-28**], minimal aortic stenosis is now
present. Estimated pulmonary artery  systolic pressures are
similar. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 56F with MMP including hypoventilation syndrome,
OSA and pulmonary HTN who presents with an episode of
palpitations and found to be in decompensated heart failure.
.
1. Palpitations/ ?presyncope: Etiology of palpitations seems
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports that she has been maintaining adequate
PO intake, thus no reason to suspect that she was
intravascularly depleted. Patient's body habitus does not
support hyperthyroidism.  ECHO shows worsened TR but otherwise
little change from prior TTE on [**11-1**].  Heart function is
hyperdynamic with EF 60-65% on this admission, but does not
explain her presenting complaint of palpitations. No clear
etiology for palpitations. Patient without any events on
telemetry throughout hospital stay and without recurrence of
palpitations. Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient scheduled.

.
2. Pulm HTN: Continue patient on Viagra and BiPAP. New settings
recommended by Sleep service were made to patient's home machine
and she tolerated using it well in the hospital. Patient was
seen by the Pulonary service who recommend that she continue on
lasix for aggressive diuresis. Do not feel that she would
tolerate addition of other medications well and that much of her
difficulties are related to fluid overload. Pulmonary
recommended diuresing 1-2 liters of fluid off per day and
closely following her weights. While an inpatient, she received
80 mg PO Lasix [**Hospital1 **] with vigorous response. Her electrolytes were
closely monitored in the setting of aggressive diuresis but did
not require repletion. She was discharged to home on 80mg lasix
qd for continued diuresis (see CHF below). Discharged with home
O2 (3L resting, 4L with ambulation). Pulmonary followup.
.
3. Asthma/ COPD: Patient's bicarb reflects chronic hypercarbia.
Steroids were discontinued in the MICU secondary to low
suspicion of flare and minimal wheezes on initial exam. Her home
nebs were continued as needed and the patients respiratory
status remained stable. She did not require antiobiotics or oral
steroids during her stay.
.
4. r/o PE: D-dimer was 700, CTA showed no saddle embolus or PE
in the large vessels. Pulmonary embolism successfully ruled out.
.
5. CHF: Preserved EF, likely diastolic dysfunction. BNP elevated
on admission. Patient presents with bilateral LE edema which has
been worsening over past few weeks and reported 20+ pound weight
gain (reports dry weight 163). Long h/o med non-compliance.
Repeat TTE unchanged from prior. Dietary teaching for low sodium
diet. Diuresed per above. Will need continued diuresis as
outpatient and cardiology followup.
.
6. HTN: Well-controlled. Continued home BB, ACEi.
.
7. Ischemia: No active issues. No known CAD but multiple risk
factors. Cont ASA, BB, ACEi. Consider starting statin as
outpatient.
.
8. Hematuria: Mild, likely irritation from foley. U/A not
suspicious for UTI and culture negative. Foley removed and
hematuria resolved.
