CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old woman with
a past medical history of back pain with pain medication
addictions, who presented from an assisted-living facility
with shortness of breath.  Patient was in her usual state of
health until approximately three days prior to admission,
when she noted onset productive of green sputum.  She denied
any fever or chills.  This persisted over the next three days
and was eventually accompanied by shortness of breath.

Over the last 12 hours prior to the presentation at [**Hospital1 1444**], she became progressively
more shortness of breath, requiring an Emergency Room visit.
In the Emergency Room, she was noted to be hypoxic and
tachycardic, with initial room air sats in the high 70's.
Initial arterial blood gas on 8 liters nonrebreather was
7.42/34/48.  This improved to 7.39/42/372 with BiPAP.  Chest
x-ray showed diffuse pulmonary edema/ARDS.

Cardiology was consulted, and a bedside echocardiogram was
performed, and it was reportedly normal.  When the patient
remained persistently hypoxic and had increasing work of
breathing, she was intubated.  She was also pancultured, and
given doses of levofloxacin and erythromycin.  Patient was
admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.

8. History of overdoses on medications.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1. Prempro.

tobacco times last 20 years.  No known history of IV drug
use, cocaine use.  History of overdoses to Tylenol, Benadryl,
Xanax in the past.  Of note, the day prior to admission was
the 18th anniversary of the patient's daughter's death.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals:  Temperature 98.3, pulse 96,
blood pressure 121/83, 98% on FIO2 100%.  General appearance:
Patient was intubated, sedated.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive, and accommodated to light.  Sclerae are
anicteric.  Extraocular eye movements intact.  Mucous
membranes moist.  No oral lesions noted.  Neck:  Supple.
Positive jugular venous distention.  No bruits.  No
lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Crackles at both lung fields.
Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2 auscultated, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
clubbing or cyanosis, trace pretibial edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES, X-RAYS, ELECTROCARDIOGRAM, AND OTHER
TESTS:  Laboratory data on admission showed a white blood
cell count of 14.3 with 88.8% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes,
hemoglobin 10.7 with MCV of 97, hematocrit 31.4, platelets
254.  Serum electrolytes on admission were a sodium of 134,
potassium of 4.1, chloride 97, bicarb 20, BUN 21, creatinine
0.9, glucose 159. Coagulation profile showed a PT of 12.4,
PTT 25.3, INR 1.0.  Urinalysis showed [**1-16**] red blood cells,
[**1-16**] white blood cells, moderate bacteria, no yeast, [**4-23**]
epithelial cells.

Initial arterial blood gas:  7.4/34/48.  This improved to
7.39/42/372 on 100% nonrebreather.

Chest x-ray upon admission showed bilateral air space
opacities affecting the mid and lower lung zones.

CT scan of the chest ([**2109-5-6**]):  Demonstrated diffuse
alveolar process with ground-glass opacification and
scattered areas of more confluent opacification, as well as
thickened septal lines, particularly in the right lower lobe.
Differential diagnosis for this appearance is broad and
included pulmonary edema, infection, and pulmonary
hemorrhage.  Given the normal size of the heart, causes of
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be considered,
emphysema.

Electrocardiogram ([**2109-5-6**]):  Sinus tachycardia, rate 117.
Otherwise, normal tracing with no acute ST-T changes.

Chest x-ray ([**2109-5-7**]):  Interval decrease in the extent of
diffuse opacities over lung fields suggestive of improved
pulmonary edema.  There are no pulmonary effusions.  Soft
tissue osseous structures unremarkable.  Lines and tubes in
appropriate position.

Sputum culture:  Rare OP flora.  Sputum Gram stain:
Gram-negative rods.  Blood cultures:  Negative x2.  Urine
culture:  Negative with no growth.  Urine Legionella antigen
negative.

Serum toxicology screen:  Positive for acetaminophen.  Urine
toxicology screen:  Positive opiates, status post intubation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure, diffuse pulmonary edema:
Patient presented with an ARDS-like picture.  Etiology
included infectious versus toxic ingestion related.  She was
started on the ARDS-NET ventilation strategy.  Permissive
hypercapnia was allowed for.  FIO2 was weaned as tolerated.

In light of the concerns for an infectious etiology, she was
started on Levaquin and azithromycin.  After results of her
sputum culture returned showing gram-negative rods, she was
switched to Levaquin and gentamicin.

By [**2109-5-7**], the patient was awake and moving.  Her FIO2 and
PEEP were weaned down throughout the course of the day, she
tolerated this well.

By [**2109-5-8**], the patient was in clinically improved via
stable oxygenation status and improving chest x-ray.  On the
morning of [**2109-5-8**], she was extubated without incident.
After extubation, the patient was transferred to General
Medicine Floor.  Initially, she was started on O2 via nasal
cannula.  Her O2 was weaned down as tolerated by her
saturation levels.  At the time of discharge, she was stable
on room air.

Additionally, she was continued on Levaquin for the course of
her stay in order to cover for an infectious etiology for her
diffuse pulmonary edema, although her cultures returned
negative.

2. Hypotension:  On [**2109-5-6**], the patient had an episode of
hypotension to blood pressure of 70/40.  A right radial
arterial line and left subclavian central line were placed in
the MICU.  The patient required dopamine for this episode of
decreased blood pressure.  Initially she was started on
hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h.  Her blood pressure stabilized,
and [**2109-5-7**] dopamine was weaned.

3. Psychiatric:  A possible etiology of the patient's diffuse
pulmonary edema included toxic ingestions.  As patient had
history of overdoses, serum urine and toxicology screens were
sent with results as above.  She was started on Ativan and
Fentanyl to cover for benzodiazepine or narcotic withdrawal.
Initially her outpatient psychiatric medications were held
with the exception of her fluoxetine.

A psychiatric consultation was obtained.  Impression was that
the patient likely had impaired judgement and poor impulse
control.  She may well have taken excess medications without
suicidal intent.

Recommendations from Psychiatry included continuation of
standing Klonopin doses ordered, and monitoring for possible
alcohol withdrawal with treatment of benzodiazepines per CIWA
protocol if clear symptoms of withdrawal.

The patient initially expressed interest in discharge to a
HRI Mental Health Program.  She was screened by Social Work
and a psychiatric nurse case manager.  However, ultimately,
patient decided that she would like to be discharged to home
with additional mental health nursing services.
