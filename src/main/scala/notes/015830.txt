Reports:
[**2163-1-26**]- head CT:
FINDINGS: No edema, masses, mass effect, hemorrhage or major
vascular
territorial infarction is noted. Dystrophic calcification of the
basal ganglia is visualized. The patient shows severe
calcification of both vertebral arteries and the cavernous
portion of both carotid arteries. The patient shows signs of
hyperostosis frontalis. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are clear.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology including no
intracranial
hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  52 y.o. F with lupus s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2151**]
on   immunosuppressive therapy, C4 tetraplegia, CAD, CHF, PVD,
HCV, recently here for prolonged hospitalization [**Date range (1) 101813**]/07
for multiple medical problems, now returns with complaint of
anemia and fatigue, worsening x 1 day.  She was transferred to
the ICU for fever and hypotension concerning for possibility of
sepsis.  Her course was unremarkable with stable blood pressure
and respiratory status.  She did have persistent oliguric renal
failure throughout her ICU stay unresponsive to IVF.
.
# Goals of care: Though her multiple medical problems are
described below, in many ways the primary issue during much of
her ICU stay was that of goals of care. She seemed hesitant to
undergo more invasive interventions (e.g., central lines, NG
tubes, and other means of giving nutritional support) but was
initially also reluctant to embrace the idea of a comfort-care
plan. Her husband also was torn about how aggressively to pursue
attempts at prolonging life vs increasing comfort. Two family
discussions in the MICU moved the patient's code status from
full code (on arrival) to DNR and probably DNI (but with a
request to contact husband in the event of the possibility of
intubation, which was not a sustainable code status); and to
DNR/DNI with the caveat that the patient and husband would be
willing to reverse this code status for procedures. Palliative
care service was consulted and followed.
.
# Fever, hypotension: Concerning for possibility of sepsis [**2-19**]
bacteremia from recent debridement of sacral decubitus ulcers.
Pneumonia also considered although no evidence of infiltrate on
CXR.  She was treated with vancomycin and
piperacillin-tazobactam for broad coverage.  Given oliguric
renal failure vancomycin was dosed based on daily trough levels.
 She was bolused initially to maintain SBP >60 and then remained
stable hemodynamically for the remainder of her ICU stay.
.
# Oliguric renal failure s/p renal transplant: likely from
intravascular volume depletion given fever, hypotension,
possible sepsis. She continues with oliguria despite IVF boluses
and MAP > 60.  She was followed by renal throughout her ICU
stay; a 24 hour urine collection suggested that she has profound
renal failure, masked by standard chem 7 because her creatinine
production is so low because of low muscle mass. She was
continued on her transplant medications including MMF,
prednisone and cyclosporine, though as she was less able to take
PO medications, this was being reconsidered as she was
transferred back from the ICU. Her furosemide and ACE inhibitor
were held given oliguria.  Bactrim DS for PCP prophylaxis was
continued.
.
# Sacral decubitus and ischial ulcers - She has stage III/IV
ulcers, twice debrided by plastics. Based on their second
debridement they do think that osteomyelitis is a strong
possibility and she will therefore need 4-6 weeks of antibiotics
for suppression of presumed osteo.  She was continued on vanc
and zosyn. Her extremely poor nutritional status would have to
be corrected for these to even begin to heal (plastics
recommended albumin at least >3.0); and given her immobility and
the fact that these ulcers are located at each pressure point of
any supine position, how she might heal even under better
circumstances is not clear.
.
# Hyponatremia: Her sodium was often near her recent baseline
around 126-128. On last admission this had gone down to 116.
This was likely secondary to heart failure and poor perfusion,
leading to ADH response to defend volume. We attempted to give
normal saline to the extent tolerated to try to increase her
sodium, with slight success.
.
# Acute on chronic anemia: Her hematocrit was 23 as she came in,
baseline 28-29. We transfused several times during the
admission. She was guiaic negative suggesting against GI blood
loss. She does receive epoeitin as an outpatient and her anemia
is most likely secondary to her kidney failure.
