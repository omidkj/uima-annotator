History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 25-year-old incarcerated gentleman who was beaten
in a prison fight 4 days prior to presentation in the emergency
room. He complained of diffuse pain but then this worsened to
odynophagia and finally developed neck swelling and crepitus. On
his preoperative studies, a chest CT noted the
presence of pneumomediastinum and air around the cervical
esophagus. There was pleural fluid which looked more complex
than a simple effusion in both pleural spaces. A Gastrograffin
swallow confirmed the location of the tear to be in the cervical
esophagus. There did not appear to be any other esophageal
pathology.

INDICATION: 25-year-old man with ruptured esophagus.

COMMENTS: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest are reviewed,
and compared with previous study of [**2101-10-2**].

The left chest tube remains in place. There is continued small
left pleural effusion with atelectasis in the left lung base.
Minimal patchy atelectasis is seen at the right lung base. The
lungs are clear otherwise. The heart and mediastinum are within
normal limits.

The tip of the right-sided PICC line is identified in the distal
portion of the right subclavian vein. No pneumothorax is noted.

BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM

INDICATION: 25-year-old man with esophageal rupture and repair.

BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM: Orally administered Optiray contrast was
observed under fluoroscopic guidance passing freely into the
stomach with no evidence for extra luminal extravasation. Thin
barium was then orally administered for better resolution of the
esophagus. There is no aspiration into the airway and no
significant retention in the vallecular or piriformis sinuses.
No structural abnormalities are detected in the region of the
pharynx, cervical esophagus, or mid and distal esophagus. Normal
primary peristaltic contractions. There is no evidence for extra
luminal extravasation of contrast.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for extraluminal extravasation.

ESOPHAGEAL STUDY

INDICATION FOR STUDY: Evaluate for esophageal leak following
trauma to neck.

A scout film of the upper thorax and neck reveals free air
within the mediastinum. Thereafter, a water-soluble esophageal
study was performed which demonstrates a leak in the upper
esophagus on the right side at the level of the manubrium. Free
extravasation of air and contrast is noted to the right side of
the esophagus at this level with passage of leaked contents both
superiorly and inferiorly tracking along the right side of the
esophagus. The remaining mid and distal esophagus is entirely
normal with no leakage present or mucosal irregularities.

IMPRESSION: Rupture of esophagus on right side at level of
manubrium with leaked contents traveling both superiorly and
inferiorly along the right side of the esophagus. These findings
were communicated immediately to the ordering surgeon Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 2347**] service at [**Hospital1 18**] via
the ED on [**2101-9-8**].  On that day, he underwent a repair of his
cervical esophageal perforation with wide drainage of the neck,
right thoracotomy, exploration and wide drainage of the
mediastinum, placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube, placement of left chest tube, esophagogastroduodenoscopy
and flexible bronchoscopy.  For details of the procedure, see
operative dictation.  He was taken to the SICU post-operatively
intubated and sedated.  He was placed on Vancomycin, Zosyn and
Fluconazole as prophylaxis.

Upon presentation, his diagnosis was made via an esophagram
which showed his esophageal rupture was at the level of
manubrium with leaked contents traveling both superiorly and
inferiorly along the right side of the esophagus.  A follow-up
esophagram was done on POD 9 but showed a continued leak.  He
was therefore kept NPO.  This exam was then repeated on POD 20
with resolution of the leak.  He was transitioned to sips of
clears on that day and then slowly advanced thereafter; all of
which was well tolerated and without issue.  Lastly, he had been
on tube feeds throughout his hospital course and which were
begun on POD 4.  He was then cycled starting on POD 23.  These
were discontinued on POD 25 given his very good PO intake.

From an infectious disease standpoint, a sputum culture on [**9-11**]
returned positive for Klebsiella and he was additionally placed
on Unasyn.  Furthermore, a JP fluid culture from [**9-22**] was also
positive for Klebsiella and he was then switched from Unasyn to
Levofloxacin on [**2101-9-24**] for more narrowed, specific antibiotic
coverage.  He, however, continued to spike intermittent fevers
during his initial hospital course despite broad and specific
spectrum antibiotic coverage.  He was then taken back to the OR
on [**2101-9-26**] for a Left VATS after two large loculated pleural
effusions were noted on imaging.  For details of the procedure,
see operative dictation.  His vancomycin was sto
