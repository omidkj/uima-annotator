thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The balloon pump tip is seen
about 6 cm below the left subclavian take off.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a small pericardial effusion.
7. There is a moderate left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 2427**] was admitted emergently on [**2152-2-6**] for a cardiac
catheterization. This revealed a subtotal occlusion of her left
main coronary artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed as
she was hypotensive in cardiogenic shock. She was taken
emergently to the operating room where she underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see operative
note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative
day one, her intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and removed
without complication. As a sputum culture from the outside
hospital returned positive for Haemophilus influenza,
levofloxacin was started. She remained intubated due to acidosis
and volume overload. She underwent a bronchoscopy for clearance
of her left lower lobe secretions. Sputum cultures were again
sent.  The patient was extubated but required re-intubation.
She did have a left pleural effusion and was diuresed
aggressively on a lasix drip.  Steroids were started.
Respiratory status improved and she was subsequently extubated.
The patient did complain of a hoarse voice and was seen by ENT.
She was found to have temporary right vocal cord paralysis and
the recommendation was to observe and follow up with ENT as an
outpatient.
The patient was started on diamox for contraction alkalosis.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  She was transferred to the floor on POD 8.  The
patient continued to make progress with physical therapy and was
discharged to rehab in good condition on POD 12.
