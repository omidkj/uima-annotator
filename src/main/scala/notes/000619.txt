Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
58 year old white male with CHF.

Cardiac catheterization [**2123-2-22**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year-old male with known 3-vessel CAD, severe
systolic dysfunction with EF 18% on ventriculogram in [**1-/2123**],
DM type 2, and [**Hospital 15134**] transferred from [**Hospital 4068**] hospital for
management of fever, CHF and NSTEMI. He was recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2123-1-28**] after a 3-week admission for pulmonary
edema, and pneumonia. During that admission, a cardiac
catheterization revealed diffuse 3-vessel CAD with 60% LMCA
disease, serial LAD lesions as well as diffuse disease of LCx
and TO of RCA with collaterals. He had a BiV pacer placed during
that admission (for polymorphic VT). Per report, medical
management of his CAD was advised.

He had been managing well as home for 3 weeks, with ongoing
treatment of a sacral decubitus ulcer. Over the past 2 days, he
developed anorexia, fatigue and "cold symptoms". He denies C/P.
He subsequently developed a low-grade fever and progressive
shortness of breath, with dry heaves during the night prior to
admission. He was taken to [**Hospital 4068**] hospital, where he was found
to have a temperature of 101, leukocytosis (WBC 13), positive
cardiac enzymes (CK 492/MB 26), EKG A-sensed, BiV paced. He was
started on NTG drip, and given Levaquin/Zosyn and Lasix 40. CXR
was consistent with CHF. At the outside hospital, he developed
worsening respiratory distress, ABG 7.18/84/89 and he was
intubated. En route to [**Hospital1 18**], he became hypotensive with SBP in
70s, and was started on a Dopamine drip.

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on Heparin and Integrillin
IV. He had a 20-beat run, then a 2-minute run of WCT at 120-130
while on Dopa, BP approximately 100. Lidocaine was started at 2
mg/min for presumed VT, Dopa changed to Levophed. Zosyn and
Vancomycin given in the ED.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

or pacing wire
is seen in the RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely dilated LV
cavity. Severely
depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

size. RV function
depressed.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Normal
mitral valve
supporting structures. Mild (1+) MR. Normal LV inflow pattern
for age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures. Borderline PA systolic
hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal image quality
- poor apical
views.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection
fraction 20-30
percent). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2123-2-22**], the left ventricular ejection fraction, while still
significantly
impaired, is increased, and the end-diastolic dimension has
decreased.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year-old male with diffuse 3-vessel CAD with 60% LMCA disease
on last cath in [**2123-1-2**], also with DM and HTN, admitted
with fever, hypotension, CHF, and NSTEMI.
In the ED, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on Heparin IV, and
Integrillin. Decision was made to perform LHC and RHC to
reevaluate the LMCA lesion and assess intracardiac pressures. He
was taken to the cath lab on [**2123-2-22**], where coronary
angiography revealed critical 70% LMCA, proximal and mid 80% LAD
lesions, moderate
