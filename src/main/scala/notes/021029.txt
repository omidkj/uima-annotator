when he was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after treatment for pneumonia,
he has felt more weak. He is now nearly unable to stand on his

troponin at 'baseline' of 0.05. CXR was negative for acute
process. EKG showed Afib with LAD, TWI in lateral leads and 1-mm
ST depressions in V4 to V6, also with 2mm isolated STE in V2.
Patient was administered aspirin 325 mg, ceftriaxone 1g,
kayexelate, azithromycin 500 mg, Vancomycin 1g for presumed
pneumonia and hyperkalemia. He was also seen in the ED by
transplant surgery for a thrombus in his new RUE AVG -
transplant surgery plans to perform thrombectomy on [**2122-6-9**].

appears well. He denies CP, SOB, productive cough, abdominal

but thinks stools are more frequent than normal. Did have a dark
bm this morning. His wife [**Name (NI) **] is very involved in his care.
They state his graft was working [**Name (NI) **], wed, thurs of last week
but could not be accessed and had no thrill on friday.
.
Of note, the patient was recently hospitalized twice. First on
the transplant surgery service after his RUE AVG from [**5-6**] to
[**5-10**] for proctitis - C.diff + during that admission (PO flagyl
and vancomycin have been continued since [**5-6**] - due to finish on
[**6-9**]). He was again hospitalized from [**5-19**] to [**5-21**] on the medicine

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old man with h/o ESRD on home HD, recent hospitalization
for MRSA pneumonia ([**2122-5-15**]), recent C.diff infection ([**Month (only) 958**]
[**2122**]), Afib on coumadin, HTN, Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
25-30%), shortgut syndrome, who presented with persistent cough
and weakness.  His respiratory status declined throughout this
admission, prompting frequent hemodialysis and ultrafiltration
to improve pulmonary edema in addition to a 10 day course of
antibiotics for hospital acquired pneumonia.  Despite this, his
respiratory failure worsened and he continued to require 4L of
oxygen.  Pulmonary edema worsened and required nearly daily
hemodialysis or ultrafiltration.  The decision was made with the
patient and his family to transition to home hospice.  He passed
away with his wife at the bedside on [**2122-7-2**] at 12:00PM.
