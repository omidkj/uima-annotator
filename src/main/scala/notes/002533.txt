[**2115-11-12**] Echo: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild to moderate central ([**1-4**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen, worse at pressures of 140's systolic.
Vena contracta for mitral jet ranged from 0.2-0.4 cm. There is
mild partial anterior prolapse and borderline annular dilation
of the mitral valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2115-11-17**] CXR: There again is noted bilateral areas of
consolidation throughout both lung fields, which are stable.
Findings are worse within the lung bases. Cardiac silhouette is
upper limits of normal, but stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit for coronary bypass grafting. He
had previously  undergone pre-operative work-up and cardiac
catheterization on [**11-1**] which revealed severe left main
coronary artery disease. On [**11-12**] he was brought to the
Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft x
4. Please see operative report for surgical details. In summary
he had: Coronary artery bypass grafting x4;
with left internal mammary artery grafted to the left anterior
descending, reverse saphenous vein graft to the first marginal
branch, ramus intermedius and first diagonal branch. His bypass
time was 89 minutes with a crossclamp of 70 minutes. He
tolerated the surgery well.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. He was hemodynamically stable in
the immediate post operative period and later that day he weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. On
POD1 he was transfered to the floor for further recovery. Beta
blockers were resumed and diuresis was initiated with a goal of
matching his pre operative weight. All tubes lines and drains
were removed according to cardiac surgery protocol. On POD3 he
was noted to be febrile. A white blood cell couont was checked
and found to be elevated, a chest Xray at that time revealed
bilateral opacities, sputum cultures were sent. The eventually
grew GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S) and he was begun on appropriate
antibiotics. His fever and elevated White Count resolved.
Physical Therapy worked with him for strengthening and
mobilization.
His antidepressents and anxiolytics were resumed
post-operatively. The remainder of his post operative course was
uneventful and he was discharged home with visiting nurses on
post-operative day six. All medications, restrictions and follow
up care was discussed with him prior to going home.
