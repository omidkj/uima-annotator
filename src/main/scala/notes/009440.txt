Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is [**Age over 90 **] yo f with HTN, DM II, OA, and h/o Klebsiella UTI
(multi-drug resistant), who reportedly had episode of
hematemesis this AM.  Pt lives at [**Hospital1 **], and vomited 80cc of
bright red blood this AM, and was also found to be tachycardic
and diaphoretic.  She had SOB and abdominal pain as well. Per
pt's son, she was "sharp as a tack" 2 days ago for a birthday
party (her birthday is today), and now has worsened mental
status.  No hx of diarrhea, hematochezia, hematuria, or dysuria.
 Per pt's son, pt may have had course of [**Name (NI) **] for UTI several
months ago.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt had Temp 101.6, BP 200/108, HR in the 140's, was
diaphoretic, and c/o abdominal pain.  NG lavage was attempted x
2, but was unsuccessful due to pt's inability to cooperate.  The
pt also refused central line placement. Pt was found to have a
dirty UA, and a CT abd showed pan-colitis.  She was given 2L NS,
Levoflox 500mg IV, Vanc 1g IV, Morphine 2mg x 2, Protonix 40mg
IV, Metoprolol 5mg IV x 1, Anzemet 12.5mg x 1, and Tylenol 650mg
PR.

Pertinent Results:
CT abd:  Pancolitis.  The appearance is nonspecific and could be
secondary to infection, an inflammatory process, or ischemia.

appear patent.  Gallbladder fundal adenomyosis.  Low attenuation
splenic foci, which are incompletely characterized on this exam.

.
CXR: Cardiomegaly with a tortuous aorta is again seen and
unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is unremarkable.  No
infiltrate or consolidation is identified within the lung. No
pleural effusion is seen.  No intraperitoneal free air is
identified. Gas-distended fundus of the stomach is noted.
.
EKG: sinus tach @ 126, LAD, nl intervals, <1mm STD in V5-V6

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  [**Age over 90 **] yo f with HTN, DM II, OA, h/o UTI's, who now presents
with hematemesis, UTI, and pan-colitis.
.
#) Hematemesis: Upon admission, the patient was reported to have
approximately 50cc of hematemsis.  She was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in
hemodynamically stable condition.  Her Hct upon admission was
50.0, thought to represent hemoconcentration [**2-6**] severe
dehydration in the setting of pan-colitis.  This returned to her
baseline around 28-30 after IVF hydration and then remained
stable.  GI was made aware of pt, however plan for EGD was
deferred as pt/family wish to avoid aggressive invasive
measures.  The patient had no further episodes of hematemesis
and her Hct remained stable. ASA, NSAIDS were avoided and she
was put on Protonix.
.
#) Pan-colitis:  An abdominal CT scan with contrast upon
admission showed a pan-colitis.  The differential included
infectious (? C dif), inflammatory, or ischemic causes.  An
infectious etiology was thought to be most likely given fever,
elevated WBC count, and was guaiac negative.  Ischemia was
thought to be less likely given pan colitis distribution.  Stool
cultures were sent and were negative (C dif x 3 was negative as
well as Campylobacter, O&P and stool culture.  She was treated
with flagyl, and meropenem for 6 days.  Pain control acheived
with fentanyl patch + prn morphine.  After three negative C difs
and clinical improvement in her abdominal exam, her antibiotics
were discontinued.
.
#) Respiratory distress/Hypoxia: While in the ICU, the patient
was noted to have one episode of mild respiratory distress with
pulmonary edema after getting IVF hydration.  She was
approximately +7 Liters at the time after aggressive IVF
hydration for pan-colitis.  Her respiratory distress was [**2-6**]
volume overload and mild CHF from diastolic dysfunction.  She
was gently diuresed with excellent response to Lasix 10mg IV and
got daily Lasix.  She will be discharged on daily PO Lasix which
will need to be titrated based on daily weights, monitoring Cr
and UOP (this was discussed with patient's PCP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 622**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
before discharge).
.
#) Acute Renal Failure: Upon admission, the patient's Cr was 1.0
(near her baseline 0.9-1.3).  Her Cr climbed to as high as 1.4
after gentle diuresis for volume overload with Lasix.  Her
creatinine trended down and was 1.2 upon discharge.  Her volume
status and creatinine will need to be monitored as an outpatient
as she will be going home on daily Lasix 10mg daily (this may
need to be titrated, possibly qday or QOD).
.
#) UTI: The patient has a long history of multiple Klebsiella
UTIs that are multi-drug resistant (ESBL, extended spectrum
beta-lactamase producing).  Her urine culture upon admission
showed Klebsiella (again ESBL but sensitive to Meropenem, pt
cannot take cephaloporins or PCN, Klebsiella was resistant to
Cipro, Bactrim, Nitrofurantoin and Levofloxacin).  She completed
a 6 day course of Meropenem.
.
#) Tachycardia: The patient was admitted with tachycardia to the
120s thought to be [**2-6**] intravascular volume
depletion/dehydration as well as from diffuse abdominal pain.
After volume resuscitation upon admission and resolution of
pain, the patient's HR improved.  She appears to run between
90s-105 at baseline.
.
#) Hypertension: Pt has a h/o of HTN, which was treated with
metoprolol and initially with prn hydral and nitropaste.  Her
blood pressure improved during her hospital stay and she
required only Metoprolol to control her BP during the remainder
of her hospital stay.
.
#) Fever: Thought to be secondary to UTI and colitis.  She
completed 6 days of Meropenem for resistent Klebsiella UTI and
Flagyl for colitis of unclear etiology (C dif x 3 negative).
Her fevers trended down during this admission and she was
afebrile before discharge.
.
#) Mental status change: Thought to be likely secondary to
infection and hypovolemia superimposed on mild dementia.  On HD
#2, her MS improved significantly after IVFs.  She was restarted
on Remeron and Neurontin after her mental status returned to
baseline.
.
#) Arthritis: Stable.  She was continued on her outpatient
low-dose prednisone, and fentanyl patch.
.
#) DM II: Her diabetes was reportedly diet controlled (thought
possibly to be [**2-6**] steroids).  Finger sticks were elevated on
admission likely due to infection.  She was maintained on an
insulin sliding scale and required minimal coverage.
.
#) FEN:  Patient was maintained on a regular diet with thickened
liquids.
