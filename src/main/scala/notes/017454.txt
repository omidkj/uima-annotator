Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Anemia and upper GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD [**2148-7-4**]. Result: Stricture with nodular, ulcerated and very
friable overlying mucosa - differential diagnosis includes
changes following recent upper endoscopy, post-radiation or
recurrence of esophageal cancer. Clotted blood was seen in the
cardia and part of the fundus The cardia mucosa was edematous
and friable.  Multiple bands that were disclodged from the
mucosa were noted
No lesions amenable to endoscopic treatment were noted.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69 year old male with a history of COPD (FEV1
of 1.9 requiring 3L NC at home), pulmonary hypertention, CAD/CHF
(unknown EF), Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma,
signet ring cell type, diagnosed in Feruary [**2146**] who presents
from [**Hospital6 19155**] with a chronic upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  He was treated with chemotherapy
(FLOFOX) and radiation completed in [**2147-5-15**].  In [**Month (only) 205**] of
[**2146**], he was noted to be anemic and required monthly blood
transfusions.  In addition, he was started on iron infusions in
[**2147-9-14**].  In [**2147-12-15**], he had an EGD that showed
some "irritation in the stomach" but no direct source of
bleeding.  In [**2148-5-14**], a colonoscopy revealed extensive
diverticulosis and he had three polypectomies that were positive
for signet ring carcinoma identical to his esophageal
adenocarcinoma.  This failed to resolve his anemia and an
elective EGD done today [**2148-7-3**] showed a large clot in the
proximal stomach with ongoing oozing from the gastric cardia
contained within a small hiatal hernia.  This area was
cauterized and several attempts were made to band this.  The
patient was given two units of blood while at the outside
hospital.  His Hct went from 21.5 to 25.6.  The patient
continued to have a low level of chronic oozing and was admitted
to [**Location (un) **] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher management
and argon plasma coagulation.

For 3-4 weeks, the patient has felt weak.  He is lightheaded
when he stands. He has not fallen. He denies nausea, vomitting,
fevers, chills, and changes in weight. He denies changes in
vision. He denies BRBPR and says that his stools are "dark
chocolate". He has some numbness and tingling in his lower
extremities that has been chronic due to diabetic nephropathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 69 year old male with a history of COPD (FEV1
of 1.9 requiring 3L NC at home), pulmonary hypertention,
Barrett's esophagus, CAD/CHF (EF unknown) and esophageal
adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell type, diagnosed in Feruary [**2146**]
who presents from [**Hospital6 19155**] with a chronic upper
gastrointestinal bleed.

#Upper GI Bleed: Patient has a history of metastatic esophageal
adenocarcinoma s/p chemo-radiation with radiation gastritis and
oozing from a clot in the gastric cardia. Hematocrit was found
to be 21 at the outside hospital, he was given 4 units of packed
red blood cells at that time, and his Hct was 30.3 upon arrival
to [**Hospital1 18**]. A gastroenterology consult was obtained.  The patient
was kept NPO and was started on pantoprazole 40mg iv q12hrs. An
EGD was performed on [**2148-7-4**], which showed a stricture at the
gastroesophageal junction which was attributed to either
post-radiation changes, a recurrence of his esophageal
adenocarcinoma or changes related to a recent endoscopy. A clot
was seen in the gastric cardia.  There was no active bleeding.
No biopsies were taking due to the high risk for bleeding.  The
patient's Hct was 24.1 on [**2148-7-6**] and he was transfused one unit
of packed red cells before discharge from the hospital with
close followup.
