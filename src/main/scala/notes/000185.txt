ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with the
past medical history of dementia, urinary tract infection,

patient was deemed euvolemic.  The patient was stopped Lasix.

The patient was also started on Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously
b.i.d. for left DVT, diagnosed on a previous admission.  This
was likely the source of her PE.

was checked on [**2179-11-2**] and the hematocrit was found to be
27.3.  The patient was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells before discharge to [**Location (un) 2716**] Point.
