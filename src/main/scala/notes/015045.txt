Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, chills, RUQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP [**10-3**]

History of Present Illness:
82M with PMH of dementia, DM2, CRI (baseline Cr 1.6), cCHF and
episode of cholangitis in [**2101-3-8**] requiring ERCP with
spincterotomy and stent placement, presented to OSH with chills
and weakness, found to be hypotensive.  In [**Month (only) **], patient
presented to OSH with sharp RUQ pain, fever, found to have
cholecystitis secondary to choledocholithiasis.  An ERCP was
performed, but not all the stones could be removed, so a stent
was placed to facilitate continued drainage and a sphincterotomy
was performed.  During the same hospitalization, he also had a
CCY.  Patient was instructed to f/u for stent removal in 1
month, but was lost to f/u.  Since then, patient has had off/on
fevers over last few months, and in [**Month (only) 205**], was admitted for FUO,
thought to be due to cellulitis because they could not find
another source (but now, in retrospect, thought to be biliary).
On the day prior to transfer, patient presented to OSH with
intermittent fever, chills, weakness and RUQ pain.  He had AMS
(although he has baseline dementia, so unclear how different MS
was from baseline), T101, WBC 30, elevated Tbili 1.7.  CT abd
showed "stent in good place."  He was found to be hypotensive to
sbp 80s, but was responsive to fluids (was given 1L NS bolus and
then 2L NS at maintenance rate), was able to maintain SBP>100.
Patient never required pressors.  Due to his septic picture, he
was started empirically on Linezolid/Zosyn. Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] in case he crashes overnight and needs
emergent ERCP in the ICU, which couldn't be done in [**Location (un) **].
Of note, patient has baseline dementia and confusion, but is not
agitated, and is oriented x self, place.
.
On transfer, his labs showed: WBC 31.8 (24% bands), hct 40.5,
plt 126.
He has been afebrile.  Na 137, K3.5, Cl 101, Hco3 21, BUN 29, Cr
1.9 (baseline 1.6).  Latest ABG: 7.37/39/65, satting 95%(2L).
Blood cx from [**10-1**] are pending, UA negative, CXR clear.  Abd CT
with perinephric stranding (old), biliary stent in place (same
stent as placed in [**Month (only) **]) - concering for stent blocked.  TB
3.0 now, ALKP 200, ALT 94. Prior to transfer, [**10-2**] blood culture
returned positive for aerobic GNR in varying sizes, GPC in
chains and pairs.  An anaerobic bottle grew GNR, GPR, and rare
GPC in pairs.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient's vitals were:  T99.5 HR83
BP102/49 RR26 O2sat 99(3L).  Patient is comfortable, complains
of thirst, fatigue, and headache.  Very somnolent, but
conversant and responds appropriately to questions, although
does not provide many details.  Denies abdominal pain,
nausea/vomiting, fevers, chills.

.
ERCP [**10-3**]:
Two 10 mm irregular stones that were causing partial obstruction
were seen at the distal common bile duct. The CBD measured 11
mm. 2 stones and multiple stone fragments were extracted
successfully using a balloon. Final cholangiogram revealed no
filling defects.  As the bile duct was cleared completely, the
decision was made not to place an additional stent.
.
CXR [**10-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
Both lung volumes are very low. There is no conclusive evidence
to suggest
pneumonic consolidation. Apprearance of minimal vascular
congestion may be
exaggerated by very low lung volumes. No pneumothorax or pleural
effusion.
Grossly, the mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours appear
within a normal
limit.
.
CXR [**10-3**] respiratory distress:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Exceedingly small lung volumes. The presence of mild
pulmonary edemacannot be excluded. In the ventilated parts of
the lung parenchyma, there isno evidence of pneumonia. Bilateral
areas of basal atelectasis.
.
[**10-4**] ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters are
most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
82M with prior episode of cholangitis in [**2101-3-8**] requiring
ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement, presented to OSH
with sepsis thought to be secondary to unremoved biliary stent.
Now s/p ERCP, stent/stone removal. Was initially bacteremic with
E. coli/Enterococcus at OSH.
.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] initially and was septic - he met
SIRS criteria (RR>20 and WBC>12 with >10% bands) with a positive
blood culture and a likely source of infection.  At OSH (prior
to transfer),
