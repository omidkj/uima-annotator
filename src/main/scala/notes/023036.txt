Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amlodipine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
COPD exacerbation/Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
arterial line placement
PICC line placement
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, and lethargy. This morning patient developed
an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient
tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be
tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER.
.
According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms
consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was
without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND,
dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a
physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning.
.
In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal
any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory
evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2.
Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1,
aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg
IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient
became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but
became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was
removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2
hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and
tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation
ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to
fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of
NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x
18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2.
.
In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable.

Review of sytems:
limited due to patient sedation

CXR ([**2124-7-21**]) - IMPRESSION: Hiatal hernia, otherwise
unremarkable. Limited exam.

Echo ([**2124-7-24**]) - There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR ([**2124-8-5**]) - Kyphotic positioning. Compared with one day
earlier and allowing for technical differences, the right-sided
effusion may be slightly larger. Otherwise, no significant
change is detected. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity
consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
and a small left effusion. As noted, a right effusion is again
seen, possibly slightly larger on the current examination, with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt CHF.
Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, no s/p intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Presents with dyspnea, but no
clear cough or fevers. Per report, patient felt like this with
prior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible
pneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with
this. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram
stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew
parainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on
solumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no
evidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics
were stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were
continued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with
normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy
revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had
difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become
interimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the
50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but
required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening
secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of
note, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in
sputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely
represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the
patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped
after 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's
family and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative
care service, the patient's family ultimately
