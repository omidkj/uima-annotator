Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**]
Chief Complaint:
super obesity (BMI=66)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**7-7**]: Open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
[**7-16**]: Exploratory laparotomy, Cholecystectomy (open),
Debridement of fascial wound


History of Present Illness:
53 year-old man with a history of obesity, BMI of 66. He was
initially evaluated for gastric restrictive surgery through the
[**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 33018**] clinic on [**10-7**] and [**2132-11-10**] with
follow-up visits in the Weight Winners Program on 7 visits from
[**11-27**] to [**2133-2-6**]. His initial presentation weight
was 495.9 lbs on [**2132-10-7**], height of 73.75 inches and BMI of
64.2. [**Known firstname 62002**] was evaluated in the surgical clinic on [**2133-2-18**] at
weight of 476.4 lbs and BMI of 61.7. He was approved for the
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure and scheduled for surgery,
however during Pre-op Admission Testing he was noted to be in
new-onset atrial fibrillation with hypertension. Surgery was
cancelled and he was followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73**] of
Cardiology for management of his blood pressure and evaluation
of atrial fibrillation, for which he was placed on Coumadin. He
returned to PAT on [**2133-8-11**] with surgery date set for [**2133-8-18**]. At
this time it was noted that he had developed a left lower
extremity cellulitis
with a history of recurrent cellulitis, which had been treated
with IV antibiotics daily at [**Hospital3 2358**]. Surgery was again
postponed until the cellulitis resolved. Prior to scheduled
surgery, [**Known firstname 62002**] was followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 62003**] and
dietitian [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1356**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], RD for dietary counseling and initiation
of Xenical prior to surgery. He was admitted on [**2134-7-5**] to
undergo open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

exudates
Neck: Trachea midline. Neck supple with no adenopathy

auscultation bilaterally.

murmurs/rubs/gallops
Abd: Soft, non-tender, obese, with normal bowel sounds. Open
areas of abdominal wound on superior and inferior aspects, with
wound VAC in place.

[**7-6**] CXR: The lung volumes are significantly decreased with the
bibasilar
linear opacitiessis.  The bilateral perihilar vessel crowdness
most likely related to poor inspiration effort but underlying
pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.
[**7-7**] CXR: Question early developing opacity in the lingular
segment
[**7-8**] CXR: Worsening left lower lobe/lingular consolidation
suggesting developing infection, pulmonary engorgement
[**7-9**] CXR: Left lower lobe opacities have improved consistent
with improving atelectasis
[**7-9**] US-guided PICC placement: Uncomplicated ultrasound-guided
single lumen PICC line placement via the right cephalic venous
approach.  Final internal length is 47 cm, with the tip
positioned in the SVC
[**7-11**] Pathology (gallbladder): Chronic cholecystitis, Hyperplasia
of cholecystic duct lymph node, No calculi in this specimen
[**7-11**] CXR: Low lung volumes, left basilar opacity noted on the
prior examination has resolved in the interim.  The lungs are
grossly clear.  There is some perihilar fullness of the
pulmonary bronchovasculature.
[**7-11**] Ultrasound of gallbladder: No evidence of gallstone or
pericholecystic fluid or edema identified in the visualized
portion of the gallbladder. Fatty liver.
[**7-11**] Doppler U/S of LE: Normal flow, compressibility, and
augmentations are seen in both common femoral, superficial
femoral, and popliteal veins.  No evidence of DVT.
[**7-11**] CXR: Cardiac size is slightly increased accompanied by
increasing vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness, likely
due to worsening edema from volume overload. Small bilateral
pleural effusions.
[**7-11**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation. Possible prior anterior
myocardial infarction based on Q waves in leads V1-V3. Compared
to prior tracing of [**2134-6-21**] ventricular response rate has
increased.
[**7-12**] CXR: No obvious infiltrate or failure, possible small areas
of left
lower lobe atelectasis not excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**2134-7-5**] and underwent open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
He tolerated the procedure well with no complications. While in
the PACU the patient went into rapid AFib, became hypertensive
(200/100) with heartrate in the 100s. He was subsequently placed
on nitro gtt and lopressor gtt, SBP titrated to 150 systolic.
Vital signs were otherwise stable. He denied chest pain and
shortness of breath. He was placed on dilaudid PCA for pain
management, in addition to thoracic epidural which was placed by
anesthesia in the OR. On POD2, NG tube removed, and patient
started on Stage I bariatric diet following negative Methylene
blue test. Around mid-day on POD2, patient began tachycardic (HR
140s) with O2 sats 87% on room air and was transferred to SICU
for hemodynamic monitoring, heartrate control, and respiratory
monitoring. He received Lopressor 10mg IV with stabilization of
blood pressure and rate control (HR 110s in AFib). He was placed
on 4L oxygen via nasal cannula with improvement in oxygen
saturation to 95%. CXR revealed linear atelectasis in the right
perihilar and left retrocardiac regions, with increased opacity
in the lingular segment, suspicious for developing infiltrate.
No effusion or pneumothorax, although mild tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. He was placed NPO with IVF at 100cc/hr.
Overnight, heartrate was maintained 99-135 in AFib with
labetolol and lopressor IV. Blood pressure stabilized in
120-150s systolic. On POD3, the patient developed a low grade
temperature, for which blood and urine cultures were sent, and
prophylactic vancomycin and cefepime were started for suspected
pneumonia. He was placed on Stage I diet and coumadin was
re-started for prophylactic AFib management. On POD4, he was
transitioned to Stage II diet, which he tolerated well. On POD5,
he was transferred from the SICU to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9. AFib was stabilized
with heartrate in the 70s-90s on po diltiazem and lopressor. He
was tolerating Stage II diet, with maintainence fluids at
100cc/hr. On POD6, patient developed right sided abdominal pain,
temperature to 101.4, rigors, shortness of breath, and
tachycardia (AFib) to 120-130s. He was immediately transferred
to the SICU. At this time, he was also noted to hav
