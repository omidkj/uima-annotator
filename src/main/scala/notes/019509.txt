Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
Rectal cancer admittted for elective laproscopic sigmoid
colostomy.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Laproscopic sigmoid colostomy


History of Present Illness:
61 yo M with h/o CMML, nephrotic syndrome, penile squamous cell
in situ, presents for semi-elective diverting loop iliostomy for
newly diagnosed, partially obstructing rectal squamous cell
carcinoma.
.
Pt was recently hospitalized for hypoxia and rectal pain. He was
diagnosed with RSV pneumonia and rectal mass was biopsied
confirming a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of
the anus. He also developed and was treated for C difficile
colitis. Pt was discharged home, with follow up with radiation
oncology, heme onc and surgery. He returned today for diverting
loop ileostomy.
.
Surgery was technically successful with minimal amount of blood
loss. Due to worsening acidosis, pt was not extubated and was
thus transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for furthur monitoring.
.
Unable to obtain further ROS as pt intubated and sedated.


Past Medical History:
1) poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma of the anus, unable
to obtain anal PAP
2) Chronic metamyelocitic leukemia - Diagnosed in [**2178**] and
managed conservatively managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**]. Possibly
secondary to cyclophosphamide exposure in treatement of
Nephrotic syndrome.
3) Nephrotic Syndrome with membranous nephropathy, bx proven per

report.  Baseline creatinine 2.8.  He was treated with Cytoxan
and prednisone for approximatelyfive years, but has had no
treatment for the past four to five years.
4) Hypertension
5) Diverticulosis
6) Colonic polypectomy
7) Status post right inguinal hernia
8) Vasectomy
9) Penile implant for erectile dysfunction
10) RSV pneumonia
11) C difficile colitis
12) Squamous cell carcinoma in situ on the skin of the penis
completely excised on [**2176-5-15**], by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**];
squamous
cell carcinoma with focal superficial invasion of the skin of
the
penis completely excised on [**2180-9-22**], by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Social History:
He lives with his wife and quit smoking twelve years ago but has
a 2 to 3 pack-per-day history x 35 years.  He drinks [**12-22**] glasses
of wine nightly.  Regarding employment, he works as an insurance
broker.  All four of his children live nearby.


Family History:
Father had lung cancer.  No family history of hematological
malignancies.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 61 yo M with h/o CMML, nephrotic syndrome, penile
squamous cell in situ, who presented for semi-elective diverting
loop ileostomy for newly diagnosed, partially obstructing rectal
squamous cell carcinoma whom required persistent intubation for
acidosis.
.
#. Acidosis: Pt had acidosis post op. He was initially
transferred to the MICU for close monitoring.  ABGs with pH
nadir at 7.12 in setting of rising CO2. Such drop is more than
to be expected due to simply chronic renal disease and acute
respiratory acidosis due to vent settings.  Cause was likely
multifactorial: 1) Renal insufficiency with baseline bicarb
18-20, non anion gap acidosis; 2) Bowel prep likely decreased
bicarb to 15; 3) Increased dead space due to pulmonary disease
(DLVA elevated, expired CO2 during surgery showed Dead/V 40%)
causes "usual" settings to cause CO2 retaining. No acute changes
in expired CO2 thus do not expect operative PE as etiology of
increased dead space; 4) Perioperative lactic acid elevation
also contributed with tiny anion gap elevation. Monitored q4h
ABGs to ensure improvement back to pt's baseline (~7.35/35/18).
Once pt ventilated on his own pt's acid-base status fixed on his
own. The patient was transferred to the medicine floor and his
respiratory status remained stable.  He was discharged off of
oxygen with his oxygen saturations at their baseline.
.
#. Rectal Cancer The patient had a laparoscopic sigmoid
colostomy.  A port was placed by surgery on [**2181-3-8**] so that for
future chemotherapy as an outpatient.  The patient will follow
up with his primary oncologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**] in [**Location (un) **]
for radiation and chemotherapy.  The patient's pain was minimal
during his hospitalization.  He was given a prescription for
oral Dilaudid at discharge.  He was instructed not to drive when
taking these medications.  Patient was instructed on ostomy care
in the hospital.  He will have VNA services at home.  Patient
was instructed to follow up with his surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80876**] in [**1-23**]
weeks.
.
#. C. diff colitis:  The patient recently completed a course of
Flagyl.  He did not have any evidence of high frequency ostomy
output and did not have any fevers.
.
#. CMML:  The patient's hydroxyurea was held as it is know to
have an effect on post op healing and infection risk.  This
medication is used to control the patient's WBC count and off
the medication it rose to 25.  The surgical team talked to the
pt's oncologist and he felt it was okay to hold hydroxyurea
until Monday [**3-12**].  The patient will have his CBC checked on
Monday with the results sent to his oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**].
Further treatment will be determined by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**]
.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's' Cr remained at
baseline (~3) due to membranous nephropathy.
