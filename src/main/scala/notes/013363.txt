Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
   84yo F with PMH significant for HTN, Hypercholesterolemia,
and recent stress was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for chest pain.  On
the day prior to admission, the patient's husband developed
chest pain and was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] where he was found to have
bilateral pulmonary emboli.  The following night, the patient
developed acute onset chest pain which she described as a
"heaviness".  The pain has been constant since 9PM on the night
prior to admission and is associated with nausea.  She denies
any SOB, diaphoresis.  The chest pain is worse with lying down.
She was subsequently BIBA to [**Hospital3 3583**].
.
  On evalaution in the ED at [**Hospital3 3583**], she was afebrile,
but tachycardic to 120s, SBP of 90s which increased to 100s
after 2L NS IVF.  At the time, her ECG was significant for sinus
tachycardia in the 130s, nml axis, nml intervals, down sloping
TWI in lateral precordial leads.  Her CEs were significant for a
Troponin of 1.1 (nml between 0 to 0.04), CK of 109 (nml between
21-157).  The pt was given ASA, Plavix, BB, Morphine and became
chest pain free.  However at 14:00, the pt developed severe
recurrent chest pain.  Given the recurrent chest pain, low BP
and positive troponin, the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
urgent cardiac catheterization.
.
   At [**Hospital1 18**], the pt was taken urgently to cath.  She was found
to be hypotensive with SBP in the 80s at which point she was
given 500cc of NS.  Cardiac catheterization revealed clean
coronaries, but a ballooned and hypokinetic apex, with reduced
EF of 25% with 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] LVEDP of 35.  No obvious
outflow tract obstruction was noted on left heart cath.
.
   In the CCU, the pt arrived without chest pain but did report
some degree of shortness of breath when talking for long periods
of time.  She denied any change in energy level or body weight.
She does report a decrease in appetite over the events of the
last couple of days.  She denies any tremors, neck pain, change
in neck size, change in voice, or hoarseness.  She also denies
any fevers, chills, rigors, abd pain, n/v/d.  She normally has
one BM/day, however due to [**Month (only) **]. appetite and PO intake, she has
not had a BM for two days. She is highly active at baseline and
reports participating in aerobics classes only a few days prior
to admission.

CXR at OSH [**2128-5-12**]:
"Hyperinflation of the lungs, flattening of the diaphragmatic
leaflets, increased in retrosternal airspace, prominent
interstitial marking present at both lung bases, no evidence of
PNA.  Heart is slightly enlarged.  Pulmonary vascularity is
within normal limits.  Clear costophrenic angles."
.
ECG [**2128-5-12**] at OSH: ST at 137, nml axis, nml intervals, TWI in
V4-V6, low voltages.
.
ECG [**2128-5-12**] at [**Hospital1 18**]: NSR at 90, nml axis, nml intervals, ST
depressionsin V4-V6 and TWI in V4-V6, low voltage in limb leads.
.
Left Heart Catheterization [**2128-5-12**]:
Aortic Pressure: 99/66
LV: 101/16
LV EDP: 35
LV gram: 2+ MR, EF 25%
Coronaries: Right dominant system, no CAD.
.
TTE [**2128-5-14**]:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Tissue velocity imaging
demonstrates an e' of <0.08m/s c/w an [**Month/Day/Year **] left ventricular
filling pressure (>12mmHg). Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include akinesis of the lower half to [**12-26**]'s of the
LV.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle. The
RV function is moderate to severely depressed.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2128-5-14**]:
Single portable chest radiograph again demonstrates bilateral
pleural
effusions.  Increased vascular markings represent mild pulmonary
congestion.  Small amount of fluid is seen in the right minor
fissure.  No pneumothorax.  When compared to [**2128-5-14**], the
degree of bilateral pleural effusion remains similar in
appearance.
IMPRESSION: Mild CHF, unchanged.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 84yo F with HTN, Hypercholesterolemia and recent emotional
duress is transferred from OSH with chest pain and hypotension.
.
1.  CV:
A.  PUMP: Given reduced EF of 25%, and finding of non-occluded
coronaries, Ms. [**Known lastname 67736**] was treated for a cardiomyopathy and heart
failure, which we feel optimistically will be transient.  LV
gram demonstrated diffuse CM with apical hypokinesis and
ballooning which is consistent with this a diagnosis of
Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy, particulary in the setting of her
recent emotional duress surrounding her husband's critical
illness.  However, a viral etiology of her cardiomyopathy cannot
be entirely excluded.  Ms. [**Known lastname 67736**] remained hemodyanically stable
throughout the hospital course and did not require inotropic
support. Her urine output and mental status were within normal
limits throughout the hospital course.  Once her blood pressure
was able to tolerate the addition of medications, she was
started on an AceI to prevent myocyte remodeling, which was up
titrated as tolerated by her blood pressure.  She was also
started on warfarin therapy in the setting of hypokinesis and
advised to continue for a minimum of three months and until
instructed to discontinue it by a cardiologist.
.
B.  CORONARIES: Ms. [**Known lastname 67736**] had clean coronaries on cardiac
catheterization which obviates the need for antiplatelet
therapty.  ASA, Plavix, Integrillin were initiated but later
discontinued.  In the setting of upward trending LFT's and an
LDL<100 her statin therapy was also discontinued.
.
C.  RHYTHM: Pt is in NSR by ECG at time of discharge.  She did
have episodic, asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia later in her hospital course which responded to
beta-blockade therapy.
.
D.  Valves: Although the pt has a history of MVP,
