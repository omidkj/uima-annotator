History of Present Illness:
70 yo woman with hypertension, presents as a transfer from OSH,
intubated, s/p first seizure in the setting of elevated BPs.
*
History is per daughter/son/husband.
*
The patient is a 70 y.o. female with h/o htn, PVD s/p L common
carotid to subclavian bypass, MCA aneurysm - declined
intervention in past, who presents s/p first seizure. She was in
her usual state of health (fairly active at baseline,
independent of ADLs, drove to attended her grand daughter's
gymnastics event day PTP) until 3 weeks prior to admission when
she began experiencing new onset headaches which she described
as bilateral pressure behind the eyes. She also experienced
malaise and generalized weakness. Denied visual changes or
nausea.  Despite her family's urging she refused to seek medical
attention at that time.  One week after the onset of her HA's
she went to her PCP who thought that she had sinusitis and thus
prescribed an abx and a decongestant.  She self d/c'ed the abx
soon after since it was ineffective but has been taking the
decongestant per daughter.  11 days ago, she went to the beauty
parlor and after standing up her legs "buckled."  She felt light
headed and dizzy and her legs collapsed. Someone caught her as
she fell so that her head did not hit the ground.  Was not
incontinent of bowel or bladder. She did not allow an ambulance
to be called.  Since then she has c/o progressive
weakness/malaise such that she spent a great deal time in bed
with a cold compress on her head in dark room.  She saw her PCP
4 days ago where her BP was low and thus he thought that her
weakness was [**2-13**] hypotension and thus d/c'ed nifedipine. Since
then her HA's have worsened such that she is unable to sleep.
She also c/o eye burning. When her daughter saw her yesterday
she appeared pale, weak with red puffy eyes. Today her headache
was "unbearable" so family took her to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital. There,
her BP was 240/110. She was given labetolol 20mg at 7:40am, and
then at 7:53am she had a "grand mal seizure" lasting 3 minutes.
There were no dips in her BP or HR just before the seizure. (BP
remained elevated in the 200's, HR 88-104). Prior to seizure she
was given SLNT 0.4 mg , 1 inch nitro paste, labetalol 20 mg IV x
T, tylenol, zofran 4 mg IV. Just prior to the seizure she
complained of bilateral vision loss. She was given 2mg IV
ativan, and intubated with succ, lido, etom, propofol and vec at
8am. She was loaded with dilantin 1gram, and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for neurosurgical eval (has a known aneurysm).
In ED given 90 meq K, ceftriaxone 2 gm, acyclovir 700 mg IV,
vancomycin 1 gm IV, ampicillin 2 gm IV x T.
*
Other interesting history is that plavix was discontinued 2
months ago after her HCT dropped and she was found to be occult
blood positive at an OSH.  There she was transfused, no source
of bleeding to explain the drop could be found - EGD showed mild
gastritis, c'scope did not reveal a source.  No capsule
endoscopy was performed. She has no h/o stroke, seizure.
*
On review of systems, the pt's daughter, husband and son deny
recent fever or chills. No night sweats.  Her daughter reports a
five pound wt loss along with a dry cough of unclear duration.
Denies rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No
recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.  No focal weakness, facial asymmetry,
slurred speech.

Past Medical History:
PMH:
- Admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] in [**Month (only) **] with GI bleeding for which
her plavix was stopped. Source of GI bleeding is unclear.
- [**2118**] developed severe claudication in her left upper extremity
with loss of pulses in her left upper extremity. An arteriogram
was performed which showed a long occlusion of the left
subclavian artery starting at the aortic arch with heavy
circumferential calcification making it inappropriate for
stenting. s/p left common carotid to subclavian bypass.
- right mca aneurysm incidentally found during the above workup,
has not bleed or given her any problems in the past
- HTN - labile and difficult to control
- PVD s/p stent right leg
- COPD, smoker
- diverticulitis?
- + "arrhythmia" per family, details not known- per records, h/o
atrial fibrillation but no other documentation re coumadin etc.
PMD states that there is no known history of AF and no history
of coumadin
- no h/o kidney problems per family
- no known history of COPD per PMD and family
