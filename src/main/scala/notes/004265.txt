Admission Date:  [**2169-1-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-1-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2095-1-16**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

This is a patient who was initially transfered from [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital for elective AICD who en route developed respiratory
distress and was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] MICU status post intubation.  He was
then transferred from the MICU to the CCU after AICD and
catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male with
a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction
of 20%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, NSVT, atrial
fibrillation who is status post a V fib arrest at [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital and transferred here for AICD placement.

The patient had a syncopal episode on [**2169-1-8**] and
was found to be in V tach by EMS, but stable.  He developed
increased shortness of breath upon arrival to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital and was found to have wide complex tachycardia at
195 beats per minute at that time.  He was cardioverted and
went into V fib arrest and was defibrillated.  He was
intubated at this time for airway protection, loaded with
Amiodarone.  Status post his defibrillation, he also spiked a
fever to 101.5 F and was started on antibiotics for a
question of aspiration pneumonia which were later
discontinued when he failed to spike again and failed to have
an increased white blood cell count.  He is transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for an AICD placement at
this time.

On the ambulance ride over to [**Hospital1 188**], the patient had increasing shortness of breath, chest
tightness and respiratory distress.  His pulse went from 78
to 140.  In the emergency room at [**Hospital1 190**], he was found to be in atrial fibrillation
with wide complex with his history of old left bundle branch
block.  He was thought to be in congestive heart failure and
given Lasix.  He continued to develop increasing respiratory
distress and was intubated once again.  He was placed on AC
ventilation 12 / 700 / 5 / 100% fio2 and was noted to have
poor air movement on auscultation and an ABG of 7.31 / 53 /
370.  At this time, he was thought to have a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and was given
Solu-Medrol.  A chest x-ray done during this period of
respiratory distress showed a right patchy opacity and the
patient was thought to have a question of infection and was
also started on Levaquin.

During the intubation, the patient had a decreased blood
pressure to 60 systolic after being started on Propofol.  He
was initially admitted to the MICU Team.  The patient had a
cardiac catheterization and AICD placement and then was
transferred to the CCU Team.

on Amiodarone which was discontinued recently for a question
of pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
who is transferred from an outside hospital after syncope and
V fib arrest.  The patient is also status post intubation
upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] for
question of congestive heart failure / chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation and respiratory distress.

1.  CARDIAC:  A. PUMP:  Patient has nonischemic
cardiomyopathy as his cardiac catheterization did not show
significant coronary artery disease.  For his cardiomyopathy,
he was started on Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. which was
later changed to Lisinopril 2.5 q.d. and this can be
increased as his blood pressure tolerates.  He will also be
continued on Toprol XL 25 q.d.  Mr. [**Known lastname 24397**] will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Heart Failure Clinic.

B.  EP:  Patient has a history of nonsustained V tach and
recent V tach and V fib arrest now status post AICD
placement.  He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and
continued in well rate controlled atrial fibrillation during
this admission.  He was continued on a beta blocker.  His
Amiodarone was discontinued for his history of question of
pulmonary fibrosis.  He was restarted on Coumadin for his
history of atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy.  His
Coumadin level will be followed by his primary care doctor
and the visiting nurses will draw his INR level.  He will
follow up with the Device Clinic in seven days.

C.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient had no evidence of
flow limiting lesions on his cardiac catheterization.  He
will cont
