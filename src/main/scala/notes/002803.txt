Dyspnea/Shortness of breath

s/p intubation and extubation on [**2117-8-22**]

History of Present Illness:
61 year old lady with h/o CAD s/p MI in [**2103**] (cath in [**2113**] with
2 vessel disease, prox RCA occlusion, 40% focal LCx), CHF with
EF 35% inferior akinesis and lateral and inferoseptal
hypokinesis, dyslipidemia, h/o NSVT s/p ICD, PVD, recently
discharged on [**8-20**] after bilat BSO for adnexal cyst on [**8-19**] who
presents with acute SOB and dyspnea.  Of note, the patient was
given 1.3 L of LR in the OR, and afterwards had an episode of
hypotension (80s/50s) requiring additional fluids.  Per report,
patient presented to the ED with complaint of gradual onset of
SOB and increased anxiety over the last 24hrs.  She also
complained of CP, non-pleuritic, but could not describe further.
 She denied any abdominal pain.

In the ED, VS T 97.7, HR 135, BP 99/77, RR 18, 99% RA which
progressed to 95% on BiPAP over the course of 1 hour.  She had
increasing respiratory distress and was unable to lie flat.  The
patient was intubated and became hypotensive to 59 sys requiring
levophed drip.  Pt was also given ASA, combivent, Vanco/Ceftaz,
and started on a heparin gtt.  CT head/CTA chest was performed
which

On arrival to the floor, the patient is intubated and sedated
and unable to obtain current review of systems.

Stress: exercised for 10 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol and stopped
due to fatigue. Good functional capacity for her age;
asymptomatic. There were no significant ST segment changes
during exercise or in recovery.

[**2117-8-21**] - CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:  T
No mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline
structures, minor or major vascular territorial infarct.  Bone
and soft tissue unremarkable. No acute intracranial pathology,
including no sign of
intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2117-8-21**] - Portable Chest X-ray: Bilateral pleural effusions. No
evidence of pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is engorged
with bibasilar diffuse opacities consistent with CHF. Left-sided
pacemaker/ICD is seen and unchanged.
.
[**2117-8-21**] - CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Pt intubated. No evidence
of pulmonary embolism. No evidence of pneumothorax.  Bilateral
small pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.  Heart is
mildly enlarged.  Asymmetric diffuse ground-glass opacities with

thickening of the interlobular septum consistent with CHF. Upper
abdomen ascites.
.
EKG ([**2117-8-21**]) demonstrated sinus tachycardia with inferior Q
waves, no other specific ST-T waves changes.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2117-8-21**] demonstrated: LV wall
thicknesses and cavity size - normal. Severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20 %). RV mildly dilated w/
severe global free wall hypokinesis. No AR. Moderate MR.
[**Name14 (STitle) 37707**]. TR. No pericardial effusion.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2117-8-24**]): LV wall thicknesses and cavity size
- normal. Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20
%). Doppler imaging suggests an increased LV filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). No VSD. RV syst/ fxn borderline normal with focal
hypokinesis of apical free wall. 2+ MR. Mod. pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Similar findings to study [**8-21**].
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis w/ contrast ([**2117-8-21**]):  No abcess or bleed.
Mod - large amount of ascites - new since the previous exam with
periportal edema. Large amount of free fluid is seen within the
pelvis.  No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  Soft tissue
stranding within the subcutaneous tissues indicates an element
of anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with 2 vessel CAD s/p MI in
[**2103**], CHF with EF 35 -->20%, s/p ICD for NSVT ('[**13**]), s/p
pneumonectomy ([**3-17**]) and recent bilateral SBO ([**8-19**]) presents
with acute dyspnea and hypotension requring intubation and
pressors.
.
.
Shock/Hypotension: On the day of admission, the patient was
hypotensive requiring pressors. Given CAD history and TTE
showing worsened EF, there was a high concern for cardiogenic
shock. However, given recent surgery (b/l BSO [**8-19**])and
leukocytosis sepsis could not be ruled out. There was no
evidence to suggest hypovolemia or acute blood loss. A Swan-Ganz
catheter was placed on admission ([**8-21**]) and inital pressures
were as follows: CVP 9, RV 26/17, PAP 30/26, PCWP 21, which were
felt to be more consistent with sepsis then cardiogenic shock,
in the setting of a recent surgery.  The patient was initially
supported with levophed and vasopressin as well as fluid boluses
to maintain MAPs > 65. Empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn were started
as well as short course of Gentamicin for treatment of presumed
sepsis. Lactate level decreased from 5.4 on admission to 1.7 the
following day. Of note, the patient was afebrile throughout
admission. CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed ascites and free
fluid in the pelvis, but no abscess or other site of infection
was identified. She improved significantly on IV antibiotics,
pressors were discontinued, and Swan-Ganz was removed on [**8-23**].
On [**8-24**] the patient was converted to po levofloxacin and flagyl
and transferred to the floor. Her blood pressure remained normal
with SBPs > 100 throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.
Blood and urine cultures were followed from admission and all
were negat
