REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for infiltrates
PORTABLE CHEST ON [**2160-3-9**] AT 13:25

INDICATION: Sepsis, PICC line removal.

COMPARISON: [**2160-3-8**]

FINDINGS:

The tip of the ETT remains high 8 cm above the carina. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 31839**] was informed of this finding at 7:55 p.m. on [**2160-3-9**].

The right CVL remains in place and there is no PTX. No new
consolidations are seen and there is continued blunting at the
right CP angle.

IMPRESSION:

Stable appearance versus prior with ETT tip still high, as
discussed above.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please place percutaneous nephrostomy tube per urology. Do not
crush or manipulate kidney stone, perc neph only for
decompression.
HISTORY: 76-year-old man with urosepsis and obstructive left
ureteral stone presents for nephrostomy tube placement in the
left kidney. Prior CT scan had shown an exophytic ring lesion at
the mid third of the left kidney, suspected to possibly
represent a cystic/necrotic renal cell carcinoma.

RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 379**] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 380**], and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name **]. Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
[**Name5 (PTitle) **], the attending radiologists, were present and supervised
the entire procedure.

FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained before the
procedure. The intubated patient was placed prone on the
angiographic table. 1% lidocaine was administered for local
anesthesia over the left flank. Ultrasound imaging of the left
kidney was performed which demonstrated moderately distended
renal pelvis and calyces, several cysts, and a cystic exophytic
lesion suggestive of a renal cell carcinoma previously
demonstrated by the CT scan.

Using ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge Chiba needle was advanced
towards the collecting system of the left kidney. This
collecting system was difficult to visualize by ultrasound at
the level of the lower pole of the kidney. Attempts to opacify
the collecting system through the Chiba needle were
unsuccessful.

Fluoroscopy and ultrasonography showed that the window available
for percutaneous access was relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15015**], between the spine
medially, aerated bowel laterally, ribs cranially and the left
iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] caudally. In addition, the cystic exophytic lesion
mentioned above was adjacent to the only posterior calyx of the
mid third of the kidney. Lastly, the lower pole calyces were not
visible by ultrasound. Therefore, it was decided to access the
posterolateral calyx of the mid third of the kidney. This was
done successfully without much difficulty, again using the Chiba
needle and real-time ultrasound guidance. Cloudy urine obtained
on aspiration was sent for culture. A percutaneous antegrade
nephrostogram was performed. It demonstrated moderately dilated
collecting system of the left kidney with no passage of contrast
into the mid ureter.

An 0.018 nitinol wire was advanced and the needle was exchanged
for an Accustick system which was positioned in the left renal
pelvis. The inner dilators and the wire were removed, and a
0.035 guidewire was coiled within the left renal pelvis. The
sheath was exchanged for an 8-French nephrostomy with the
pigtail formed within the left renal pelvis. The catheter was
connected to the bag drainage. It was secured to the skin with
StatLock and 0 silk stitch. Sterile dressing was applied and the
patient was transported to the ICU in good condition. Ultrasound
images were obtained before and after obtaining the percutaneous
nephrostomy access.

COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Percutaneous nephrostogram demonstrated moderate
hydronephrosis on the left with ureteral obstruction in the mid
ureter. An 8 French left nephrostomy tube was placed
percutaneously under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidence and
connected to external bag drainage.
