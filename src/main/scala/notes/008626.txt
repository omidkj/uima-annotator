Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Xanax

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stents to the left
anterior descending coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 y/o M with h/o polio and Celiac disease who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pressure that began around 3PM on
day of admission. Patient states that he was in his USOH until
this afternoon when he used his snowblower. Developed SSCP,
rating it [**5-8**]. Associated with SOB, diaphoresis and some
nausea. He does acknowledge a recent prior episode that lasted a
whole day, but he did not seek medical attention for it.  He has
been stressed in [**2139-3-31**], which did not show any
abnormalities. Patient came to ED when pain did not subside this
time.
.
In ED, EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V4, c/w STEMI of LAD
territory. Code STEMI was called, patient given ASA, plavix,
heparin gtt, and integrillin, and taken emergently to cath lab
where a proximal LAD lesion was seen. BMS was placed. Right
heart cath at same time also showed slight step-up of pressures
from SVC to RA, which will need further eval by echo.
.
In the ICU, patient is comfortable in bed, without chest pain,
and conversant.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
.
Cardiac cath ([**2141-12-25**]):
  1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease. The short LMCA
had moderate focal calcification with distal tapering to 25%.
The LAD had
moderate calcification with a proximal hazy eccentric 70%
stenosis at a small S1 and small high D1 extending distally past
a bifurcating D2 to a
large S2. There was a 20% stenosis in the mid-LAD and the distal
LAD wrapped around the apex. There was TIMI2 flow in the LAD.
  The LCX had mild calcification with an ostial 35% stenosis and
a proximal 25% stenosis. The LCx gave rise to a modest OM1, a
long modest OM2, and a larger OM3 that extended to the
posterolateral wall and had a
proximal 30% stenosis. There was also a larger OM4/LPL1,
OM5/LPL2, modest LPL3, and twin L-PDAs. There was TIMI 2 flow in
the AV groove CX consistent with microvascular dysfunction.
  The RCA was non-dominant with a 50% stenosis in the
mid-vessel. There was an 80% origin stenosis of the proximal
AM1. There was TIMI2 flow in the RCA consistent with
microvascular dysfunction.
  2. Successful PTCA and stenting of proximal LAD were performed
with 2.25x22 mm Integrity bare metal stent postdilated using a
2.75 mm NC balloon, with a 10% residual stenosis, plaque shift
into the jailed bifurcating D2 with preserved flow, no apparent
dissection, and normal flow in the LAD (see PTCA Comments).
  3. Post-PCI hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and
left heart filling pressures (RVEDP=14mmHg and LVEDP=22mmHg).
There was mild pulmonary artery hypertension (PASP=36mmHg).
  4. Initial oxygen saturation measurements demonstarted a
step-up from the SVC to the PA. A full saturation run suggested
a small left to right
shunt at the atrial level. Pulmonary blood flow was 3.9 L/min
and systemic 3.8 L/min (Qp/Qs=1.02). These indicated a mildly
depressed
systemic flow at 2.3 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen
consumption).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease in a left dominant system
with
moderate CAD in the non-dominant RCA.
2. Anterior STEMI
3. Angiographic evidence of diffuse microvascular dysfunction.
4. Mild mild and moderate left ventricular diastolic heart
failure
(assessed post-angiography and post-PCI).
5. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
6. Oxymetric evidence of a small left-to-right shunt at the
atrial level
consistent with an ASD.
7. Successful primary PCI of LAD with a bare metal stent.
.
TTE ([**2141-12-26**]):
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

There was borderline early passage of agitated saline contrast
into the left heart with Valsalva release which is consistent
with intracardiac shunt suggestive of a probable patent foramen
ovale (versus pulmonary arteriovenous communication).

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2136-4-11**], estimated pulmonary artery syst
