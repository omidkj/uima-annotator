Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was brought to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2149-5-21**].  She had been
in an MVC when she was driving away from [**Hospital6 2561**] -
she had been there for suspicion of a Left wrist fracture, which
was found to not be fractured.  Upon arrival in the ED, her GCS
was 15.  Injuries upon examination included a left open ankle
fracture, right tibial plateau fracture, shattered right
patella, and right open wrist fracture.  Head CT, C-spine CT,
and Torso CT showed no other injuries.  The only other finding
on the CT torso was an infrarenal AAA measuring 3.8 cm x 3.4 cm.


The patient was taken to the OR the same night of admission.
The orthopedics team repaired her left ankle fracture, placed an
external fixation device on her right leg, and repaired her
right wrist fracture.  When the patient returned to the T-SICU,
she became hypotensive and tachypneic.  ABGs revealed her pO2s
in the 40s.  Given her recent trauma and orthopedic injuries,
suspicion was raised that the patient had a pulmonary embolus.
A bedside ECHO was performed, which showed Right atrium
diliation.  Patient was intubated and sent down for a CT scan of
her chest - CT showed no PE.  Patient was brought back to the
ICU and was kept intubated.  A right popliteal artery duplex was
also obtained for the right tibial posterior dislocation - the
duplex was negative for any injury of her her right leg
arteries.  Because the chest CT revealed no PE, it was thought
that the patient's desaturation episode was secondary to fat
embolism.

During the patient's period on the vent, she developed a
respiratory alkalosis.  However, whe was extubated on [**2149-5-24**] and
remained off the vent until she tired out and was reintubated on
[**2149-5-26**].  The patient's reintubation was also due to blood and
sputum cultures that were obtained on the [**2149-5-25**], and were now
growing pseudomonas - thus the patient had developed a
pneumonia.  Because the patient had failed extubation, and
because of her poor underlying pulmonary function, the patient
underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 79622**], [**First Name3 (LF) 282**], and IVC filter placement on
[**2149-5-27**].  She received double coverage antibiotics for the
pseudomonas, consisting of a regimen of Zosyn and tobramycin.

The patient progressed on tube feeds from [**2149-5-28**] through
[**2149-6-2**].  On [**6-2**], the patient was taken back to the OR with
orthopedics for conversion of her right leg external fixation to
an ORIF.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, however her
HCT level fell to 18 on the morning of [**2149-6-3**]. She was
transfused 2 units of pRBCs.  At this point in her
hospitalization, her vent settings were weanted to CPAP with
PEEP 5 and PS5.  However, patient could not tolerate being on
trach mask for extended periods.

Of note patient's albulmin level was 1.7, and her pre-albumin
level is pending at the time of discharge.
