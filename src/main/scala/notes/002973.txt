Brief Hospital Course:
60 y/o male with complicated post liver transplant surgery
course. Since last year  his course has been complicated by
recurrent hernias requiring debridements and
infection with Mycobacterium abscesses. (MYCOBACTERIUM
ABSCESSUS/MASSILIENSE/BOLLETII GROUP)
He was taken to the OR with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] for
Extensive debridement of complicated wound, including multiple
abscesses, Component separation of the anterior abdominal wall
with fascial dissection and reconstruction, Repair of large
incisional hernia with mesh, Lysis of adhesions times 1 hour and
Repair of wound more than 30 cm. This was an ext4ensive surgery,
which the patient tolerated well.
Due to past hsitory of narcotic tolerance, the patient was
initially managed on a ketamine drip in addition to dilaudid and
his baseline methadone. Over the course of the hospitalization
the regimen now includes Home Oxycontin and methadone,
breakthrough oxycodone and IV Morphine for breakthrough also.
The initial dressing was taken down at 5 days per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 15283**]
instructions, and the incision has remianed intact, with no
erythema or drainage noted. The small wound from the previous
attempt at debridement has been intact as well.
Per ID recommendations, who were following prior to this
surgery, initial antibiotics were amikacin, tigecycline and
vancomycin. After further consideration, the Vanco was stopped
and azithromycin was added. ID continued to follow during this
admission, and when the creatinine was noted to be increasing,
the amikacin was stopped and Linezolid was added.
The patient received 4 days of lasix in an attempt to diurese.
He remains about 5 Liters above his admission weight, no further
lasix has been attempted, creatinine has leveled at 1.4
(baseline around 1)
On POD 8 he had a large amount of ascitic appearing fluid drain
