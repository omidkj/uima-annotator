Gen: Sedated, intubated, nonresponsive.
HEENT: Pupils: Right 6mm fixed/nonreactive, Left 3mm minimally
reactive.
Bilateral orbital/periorbital swelling (pt's eyes effectively
swollen shut). Bright red blood actively collecting in the R
external ear canal.
Neck: Supple.

Babinski equivocal

Exam on discharge:
Pt opens left eye only to voice and or noxious.  She
occasionally makes eye contact and looks to the TV when it is
on.  Her right pupil is fixed and non reactive.  Her left pupil
is 6mm-4mm and sluggish.  She at times has had a dwonward gaze
and this seems to correlate with shunt pressure settings.  She
occasionally purses her lips and then it is evident that she has
a right facial.  She does not follow commands.  She attempts to
localize with LUE>RUE.  She has triple flexion in the lower
extremities.
Her incisions are well healed and her right cranial defect is
sunken.

HER CURRENT VALVE SETTING ON HER SHUNT IS 0.5


Pertinent Results:
[**12-29**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive intracranial hemorrhage including right frontal and
temporal
lobe intraparenchymal contusions, right hemispheric acute
subdural hematoma , diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal
cisterns and the right cerebral hemisphere as well as
intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. Mild-to-moderate right cerebral edema with shift of normally
midline
structures to the left by about 6 mm.
3. Depressed right frontotemporoparietal calvarial fracture,
right and
equivocal left temporal bone fractures, complex right greater
sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] and anterior clinoid process fracture as well as
right bilateral zygomatic bone, orbital wall, maxillary sinus
wall, pterygoid process fractures, and bilateral occipital
condyle fractures.

[**12-29**] C-spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for acute cervical spine fracture or
malalignment.
2. Right occipital and temporal bone fractures and right facial
fractures.


[**12-29**] CTA Head/Neck:
No dissection.

[**12-29**] CT Torso:
Bilateral lung contusions. No other acute injuries noted.

[**12-29**] Head CT:
Interval post-op changes. Decreased midline shift. Interval
increase of R frontal IPH.  Increased edema with some herniation
of brain tissue through the craniectomy site. Stable SDH/IVH.

[**2144-12-29**] Facial CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral Le Fort fracture(1,2 and 3 on the right, 1 on the
left) with
involvement of the superior, medial and lateral orbital walls
and the orbital surfaces of the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] and zygomatic bones
bilaterally.
2. Inferior orbital wall; posterior, medial and anterior
maxillary sinus wall fractures as well as right zygomatic arch,
complex right greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] and anterior clinoid process as well
as temporal bone fracture on the right.
3. Bilateral occipital condyle fractures.
4. Hemorrhage in the right maxillary sinus, the nasal cavity,
sphenoid sinus, frontal sinus and nasal cavity.
5. Left posterior maxillary sinus wall fracture (series 2, image
51).
6. Right mandibular fossa and squamous portion of the right
temporal bone
fractures.There is a right mandible body fracture.

[**2144-12-30**] Head CT:
1. Slighltly increased intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the
right frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.
2. Unchanged edema with swelling of brain tissue through the
craniectomy
site. Continued decrease in shift of midline structures.
3. Interval decrease in effacement of the suprasellar cistern.
4. Unchanged right subdural hematoma, intraventricular and
subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

[**2144-12-30**] MRI Total Spine
1. Small amount of fluid layering in the dependent distal thecal
sac,
compatible with subarachnoid blood extending from extensive
intracranial
hemorrhage.
2. No abnormalities of the spinal cord or vertebral bodies. No
hematoma,
fracture, or malalignment.

[**2144-12-30**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] and MR Orbit without contrast
1. Large hemorrhagic contusions in the right frontal, parietal,
and temporal lobes as previously, decompressed via large right
craniectomy, but persistent mass effect on the right midbrain.
2. Large hematoma in the right parietotemporal lobe with
layering contents. Blood extends into the intraventricular
space.
3. Extensive white matter changes in the corpus callosum, dorsal
midbrain and cerebral peduncles indicating diffuse axonal
injury.
4. Right optic nerve grossly normal, but motion limits
evaluation for edema. Orbital apex demonstrates some crowding,
although is decompressed by fracture. Intraconal hemorrhage
remains, but does not appear to predominate at the orbital apex.


[**2145-1-2**] CT Head noncontrast
1. Interval increase in herniation through the right craniectomy
site,
resulting in infarction of the herniated edges, and 4mm
rightward shift of
midline structures.
2. Multiple intraparenchymal hematomas are similar in appearance
to the prior study.
3. Interval decrease in effacement of the lateral ventricles.
There remains a small intraventricular blood component in the
right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].

EEG [**2145-1-3**]:
slowing compatible with a diffuse encephalopathy, no seizure
activity.

EEG [**2145-1-4**]:
slowing compatible with a diffuse encephalopathy, no seizure
activity.

EEG [**2145-1-5**]:
Late in the recording, epileptiform activity in the right
central region was identified in an unsustained fashion;
however,
technical problems started at 21:00 hours where it appears that
the
connector must have become dislodged. Prior to that, activity
over the
left was also abnormal but less so and, over the course of the
record,
appeared to gradually improve with better activity centrally and
some
faster frequency activity noted posteriorly.

EEG [**2145-1-6**]:
This is an abnormal extended routine EEG due to focal
epileptiform discharges in the right frontal region without
clear
evolution suggestive of cortical irritability in this region.
However,
there was no evidence of electrographic seizures during this
recording
period. Additionally, there is attenuation and polymorphic delta

slowing in the right hemisphere suggestive of subcortical
dysfunction as
well as underlying structural lesions such as a subdural
hematoma. The
background throughout the recording was slow and disorganized;
however,
at times, showed some reactivity to external stimuli. Slowing of
the
background is likely secondary to a moderate to severe
encephalopathy.

CT Sinus [**2145-1-9**]:
There is increasing opacification of the sphenoid sinus, but
with lesser
opacification of the ethmoid sinuses, particularly on the left
side. There is mild mucosal thickening in the right frontal
sinus air cell. There is
moderately prominent mucosal thickening in the right maxillary
sinus, although the likely post-traumatic hemorrhagic elements
seen on the prior study have resolved. The left maxillary sinus
appears to be normally pneumatized. There is continued
opacification of the right mastoid sinus com
