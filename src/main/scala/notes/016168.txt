Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2105-2-18**] Coronary bypass grafting x4: The left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery; and reverse saphenous
vein graft to the posterior descending artery, and the 2
branches of the 1st obtuse marginal artery

History of Present Illness:
62 year old male was seen in clinic on [**2104-9-19**], at which
time he was complaining of progressive worsening of chest
tightness with exertion. He noted symptoms typically with
walking up hills as well as stairs or during periods of stress
that he would develop chest pressure which became severe enough
to cause him to stop. This always resolved within a few seconds
of stopping activity. During a stress echocardiogram on [**2104-12-9**]
he was found to have 1-1.[**Street Address(2) 17608**] depressions in
inferolateral leads. He had a concomitant echocardiogram which
showed an EF of 40-45% with 1-2+ eccentric mitral regurgitation
and anterior basal and apical hypokinesis with no evidence of
any wall motion abnormalities with exercise in the setting of
what was determined to be a suboptimal study. He was referred
for coronary angiography. He was found to have three vessel
disease and is being referred to cardiac surgery for
revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-2-18**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with moderate hypokinesis of the mid septum and
anterior wall, and severe hypokinesis of the apex, distal
septum, and distal anterior walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The
remaining left ventricular segments contract normally. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen
originating between the non- and left coronary cusps. There is
some mild calcification of the edge of the noncoronary cusp. The
aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. Trivial to mild mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results at time of surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient is on a
phenylephrine infusion. Biventricular function is unchanged.
Mitral regurgitation is unchanged. Tricuspid regurgitation is
unchanged. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.

PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, [**2105-2-22**] AT 11:28

CLINICAL INDICATION: 62-year-old, postop day 4 status post CABG,
evaluate for
effusion.

Comparison to [**2105-2-20**] at 15:29.

PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted dated [**2105-2-22**]
at 11:28.

IMPRESSION:

Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative
appearance to the
cardiac and mediastinal contours given patient rotation on the
current
examination. There are persistent streaky linear opacities at
the left base
with likely associated small pleural effusion. Interval
resolution of the
pulmonary edema. Probable tiny but stable left apical
pneumothorax. Right
lung is grossly clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and on [**2-18**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 4. Please see operative note for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Later this day he was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he
was started on beta-blockers and diuretics and gently diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. Later this day he was transferred to
the step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. He continued to make
good progress and worked with physical therapy for strength and
mobility. On post-op day four he was discharged home with VNA
services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.  Of note he
was not resumed on lisinopril as betablockers had been titrated
and blood pressure was not sufficient, will need to evaluate on
the outpatient setting.
