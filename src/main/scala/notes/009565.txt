Admission Date:  [**2111-9-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-10-2**]


Service:  CCU MEDICINE

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:   Chest pain.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
82-year-old female with a past medical history of
hypertension, ex-tobacco use, family history of MI, who
presented to an outside hospital at 3:00 a.m. where the
patient noted the acute onset of [**10-2**] substernal chest pain
radiating to her throat associated with nausea, vomiting, and
diaphoresis.  The patient at that time took Vicodin without
relief and called EMS, at which aspirin and nitroglycerin
were given.  The patient's chest pain turned to [**8-2**] and the
patient was admitted to [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] ED where an EKG
showed EKG ST elevations in I, aVL, ST depressions in V1
through V3, II, III, and aVF.  The patient was given aspirin,
IV Lopressor, IV nitroglycerin, IV heparin and Integrelin and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization at 8:00 a.m.  The
patient was chest pain-free on arrival to our Catheterization
Laboratory.

At catheterization, the patient was found to have a 95% OM1
lesion, and a 2.5 by 13. mm stent was placed and the patient
was also found to have LVEDP around 12.  Post
catheterization, the patient remained chest pain free but had
a 40 beat run of monomorphic VT without any symptoms.  The
patient was, therefore, transferred to the CCU for close
monitoring.

The patient quit seven years ago.  The patient socially
drinks alcohol.  She is able to ambulate on her own.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Brother and sisters with MI less than age
60-years-old.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
was afebrile, blood pressure 157/77, heart rate 67,
respiratory rate 14, saturating 100% on 3 liters nasal
cannula.  General: The patient was a well appearing female in
no apparent distress.  HEENT:  PERRL.  OP clear.  MMM.  Neck:
JVP 6 cm at 45 degrees.  No lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Clear
to auscultation anteriorly.  CV:  Regular rate.  Normal S1,
S2, no murmurs appreciated.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Equal dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Right groin site was clean, dry, and intact.
No hematoma.  No bruits appreciated.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, the patient's CK
was 1,193.  CBC was unremarkable.  Chem-7 was only notable
for a K of 3.3.

EKG post intervention showed no Q waves and diffuse T wave
flattening.

Catheterization showed LVEDP around 12, OM1 with a 95%
lesion, status post 2.25 by 13 mm stent placement, RCA with
99% proximal 70% midlesion.

Tele had a 40 beat run of monomorphic VT.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was again
found to have a 99% OM1 lesion, status post OM1 stent
placement on [**2111-9-27**].  Peak CKs for this MI were 1,678.
Additionally, the patient had a proximal RCA 99% lesion, mid
RCA 70% lesion, which were not intervened on admission.
Additionally, the patient had distal aortic disease with 60%
of her bifurcation, [**Doctor Last Name **] with an 80% lesion after the
bifurcation. The patient was initially treated with aspirin,
Plavix, Lipitor, Integrelin, beta blockers, and ACE
inhibitors.  However, on hospital day number two, the patient
had two episodes of ischemic changes on EKG in her anterior
leads with nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis.

On [**2111-9-29**], the patient was taken back to the
Catheterization Laboratory where two RCA stents were placed.
Her peak CKs at that time were 806.  However, in between
these two stent placements, the patient had an episode of
coffee ground emesis and melena.  Please [**Last Name 788**] problem number
two for further discussion.

The patient was not given Integrelin after her RCA stent
placements in light of her recent upper GI bleed.  The
patient was also noted to have thrombocytopenia in light of
Integrelin and, therefore, it has been added that the patient
has an allergic reaction to Integrelin.  Again, the patient
was continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.  Her beta
blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated throughout the
hospitalization to 150 b.i.d. of metoprolol and 40 b.i.d. of
lisinopril.

An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2111-10-1**] in which her
ejection fraction was 45%.  Her left atrium was mildly
dilated.  She had regional resting wall motion abnormalities
in her inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis with 1-2+ MR.
Finally, the patient's EKGs post stent placement revealed a
few episodes of three to five beats of nonsustained VT.
However, these episodes resolved 48 hours after her second
stent placement.

EP was consulted and recommended no EP intervention at this
time and just to continue to titrate her beta blocker dose.
The patient is to have outpatient follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] in one to three months.  The patient's blood
pressures were again 130/80s, heart rates in the 60s to 70s.

2.  UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient had an episode
of coffee ground emesis and melena on [**2111-9-28**].  However, the
patient's hematocrit dropped 24 hours after her episode of
coffee ground emesis and melena.  The patient was started on
IV Protonix b.i.d. and hematocrits were followed b.i.d. until
her hematocrits remained stable for 24 hours.  The patient
was then changed to p.o. Protonix 40 q.d.  The patient was
given 2 units of packed red blood cells throughout this
hospitalization.  The patient has outpatient GI follow-up
scheduled.  Please see follow-up plans for details.  The
patient was continued on aspirin and Plavix in light of
recent stent placement.

3.  HEME:  The patient had an episode of thrombocytopenia
which was resolving on discharge.  This was most likely due
to Integrelin.  The patient's heparin and all heparin flushes
were held at the same time.  The patient was, therefore,
noted to have an allergic reaction to Integrelin, namely
thrombocytopenia.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Two days before discharge, the
patient's U/A revealed a UTI.  The patient was started on
ciprofloxacin.  The patient will be discharged with a seven
day course of ciprofloxacin.

5.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  The patient
remained stable throughout hospitalization and was continued
on Flovent and Salmeterol.

6.  DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE:  The patient, as an
outpatient, takes Vicodin p.r.n. for her pain.  The patient
was continued on this regimen with no flares of her DJD.

The patient remained full code throughout this
hospitalization.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Acute myocardial infarction.
