Allergies:
Nitroglycerin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**]
Chief Complaint:
admitted from [**Hospital 191**] clinic w/ 5 days worsening SOB, DOE


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 63M w/ h/o metastatic carcinoid tumor, HTN,
hyperlipidemia who reports increasing SOB and DOE starting about
a month ago but worsening significantly within the last 5 days.
It has recently gotten so bad he can barely get up out of a
chair without getting short of breath. He reports orthopnea but
no PND. In clinic today, he was using accessory muscles of
respiration and was mildly diaphoretic, and his O2 sat on room
air was 97%, dropping to 94% with ambulation. He reports no
fever or chills, no URI symptoms, no recent travel, no changes
in his medications.
Pt also reports ~5 episodes of chest pain in the last few weeks
which he describes as pressure on his mid-sternum and usually
occurs during exertion. There is no associated nausea or
vomiting. He says he takes a [**12-29**] tablet of Xanax when he gets
this pain sometimes which seems to help. He cannot take
nitroglycerin because of his Viagra.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. SOB: likely from CHF
The patient was initially diuresed for mild pulmonary edema: he
received 20 IV Lasix on night of admission and 40mg [**8-2**], with
good UOP. On [**8-2**], pt was reporting improvement of symptoms and
able to walk around his room with 4L O2 NC. The following day he
reported feeling worse, with increasing SOB, and was found to
now be in oliguric renal failure. CXR [**8-3**] 8am showed showed
atelectasis with possible superimposed pneumonia. Emergent TTE
showed decreased EF (30%), anteroapical infarct with
moderate-to-severe overall left ventricular contractile
dysfunction; bicusapid aortic valve with at least mild aortic
stenosis. He was sent to the MICU [**8-3**] to [**8-10**] (see below for
course).
.
On transfer back from the MICU, SOB was much improved, and he
was on 2L NC intermittently for comfort. After his ARF resolved,
he was cathed [**8-15**], showing persisting right heart failure [**1-29**]
tricuspid regurg. He was monitored in the CCU post-cath and
diuresed 1.3L until transfer back to the floor on [**8-17**]. There,
diuresis was continued with stable Cr, and the pt was weaned off
O2, able to maintain O2 saturation throughout PT exercise and
reporting much improvement from initial symptoms.
.
2. chest pain
-MI (no ischemic changes on EKG) vs. GERD vs. anxiety vs. PE
(CTA negative)
Cardiac enzymes were negative. Viagra was discontinued while
in-house so nitrates could be used if necessary. He was
monitored on tele, with no abnormalities. Xanax was continued
0.25mg prn.
.
3. HTN/hyperlipidemia/CAD
Norvasc and Lipitor were continued initially, but the
anti-hypertensive regimen was changed in MICU (see below), and
lipitor was stopped due to transaminitis. He had clean
coronaries on cath [**8-15**]. A repeat TTE on [**8-18**] showed no change
from [**8-3**]. On [**8-19**], given restoration of renal and hepatic
function, he was restarted on lipitor, and hydralazine and
nitrate were replaced with toprol XL 25qd per cardiology recs.
He may benefit from lisinopril in the future. Aspirin was
continued throughout his hospital course.
.
4. diabetes/pre-diabetic state
-diabetic diet, RISS
.
5. depression/anxiety
-continued Paxil, Xanax
.
6. PPx: subq heparin, H2B/PPI
.
7. PT: pt was started on physical therapy during his hospital
stay. By the time of discharge, he was tolerating [**12-29**] physical
therapy sessions a day and maintaining O2 sats in high 90s. PT
felt he would be able to tolerate a total of [**2-28**] hours of PT per
day spread across multiple sessions in an acute rehab setting.

MICU Course

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  On hospital day 3, the patient
began to have desaturations requiring 100% NRB to maintain
oxygen saturation.  His hypoxia was attributed to a right lower
lobe pneumonia and congestive heart failure given his new wall
motion abnormality with an EF of 35-40%.  He completed a 7-day
course of Levofloxacin and Vancomycin for empiric treatment of
hospital acquired pneumonia.  He was also given lasix for
diuresis given his positive fluid status.  Several times during
his ICU stay, he desaturated to the low 70% for brief episodes.
Some of these episodes were attributed to anxiety since his
saturations improved with ativan.  However, anxiety alone could
not explain his persistent oxygen requirement.  A chest CT was
performed to look for parenchymal disease that was not evident
on plain films.  The CT showed bilateral pleural effusions with
the right greated than the left.  The effusions were attributed
to CHF.  He was started on hydralazine and insosorbide
mononitrate for afterload reduction.  Given his persistent
oxygen requirement a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis
was performed to rule out a malignant or infected effusion.
Approximately 1 litre of clear yellow fluid that was consistent
with a transudate was removed from the right.  Pleural cultures
showed no growth at the time of transfer from the ICU.  His
oxygenation improved post-thoracentesis and he was able to
tolerate being on room air.

2. Hypotension:  His hypotension was concerning for SIRS/early
sepsis given his intial concurrent leukocytosis and elevated
lactate.  His pressure stabilized after fluid boluses during his
first 24 hours in the ICU.  After resolution of the hypotension,
his blood pressure was elevated and he required metoprolol to
maintain adequate blood pressure control.
.
3.  Metabolic acidosis:  His initial metabolic acidosis was
likely due to lactic acidosis secondary to hypoperfusion.  He
received bicarbonate infusion with correction of the acidosis
during the first 24 hours of his ICU stay.
.
4.  ARF:  The acute renal failure was likely secondary to
contrast nephropathy and overdiuresis with lasix given his
intial presentation with CHF.   His FeUrea was consistent with
pre-renal.  Renal felt that he had a resolving ATN in the
setting of hypotension and recommended repleting half his urine
output with 1/2NS for a resolving ATN.  He initially appeared to
be volume overloaded on exam and aggressive diuresis was
attempted once his creatinie returned to [**Location 213**].  However,
