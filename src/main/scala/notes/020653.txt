claudication. At that time he was started on Pletal, however he
did not see any benefit in the relief of his symptoms and he
subsequently self discontinued it.  He presented this past
[**Month (only) 216**] with complaints mostly relating to some right buttock
discomfort that he describes as a "stabbing sensation" that
occurs with ambulation and resolves with rest.  He states the
symptoms can occur at as little as 200 feet.  He also notes some
numbness in his right leg that he describes as though his "leg
has fallen asleep". This occurs independently of the right
buttock pain. He also states he experiences a cramping and
tightness in his calves with ambulation. He is very active in
caring for his 3 grandchildren and this has become very
limiting.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 84624**] is a 73yo male admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2106-12-16**],
for bilateral lower extremity ischemia with disabling
claudication.  He was taken to the operating room for an
aortobifemoral bypass with a 16 x 8 Dacron graft and a left
common femoral to above-knee popliteal artery bypass with 8-mm
polytetrafluoroethylene.  He tolerated the procedure and
anesthesia well. Patient was fluid rescuscitated, transfused w/
three units of PRBCs intra-op and postoperatively.  Patient was
unable to extubate on the day of surgery, vital signs were
labile therefore patient was transferred to the CVICU.  On POD1:
Patient remained in the CVICU w/ Swan Ganz and intubated.
Patient was extubated later then eventually transferred down to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 VICU. Post-operatively, he developed worsening renal
function, low urine output requiring fluid boluses. Patient had
problems with pain and pain service was consulted with a
recommendation of a dilaudid PCA. Remained on pressors for BP
control. Patient started becoming agitated and required
sedation. Renal service consulted for worsening renal status.
On POD2-3: He continued to have poor urine output with renal
function not imrpoving, renal service following, escalating
doses of lasix was given with no major diuresis response, given
other diuretics, that also did not result in increased urine
output as well.  POD4: Continued to be in ATN, renal service
continued to follow, ultimately recommended for hemodialysis.
Swan [**Doctor Last Name **] was discontinued, Cordis was changed over to a
hemodialysis line for this purpose. Additionally, a PICC line
was placed for intravenous access and TPN.  The The patient
continued to be intermittently confused, self-removed the PICC
line that night.  POD5: A new PICC was replaced, nutrition
consulted and TPN started. Patient received hemodialysis
treatment. Physical therapy was consulted, patient taken out of
bed w/ assistance- very deconditioned, physical therapy will
follow.  POD6: Patient continued to sundown and get more
delirious at night, pulled PICC line out again, required mitts
and side rails up for restraints. Ileus resolved, moved bowels
and tolerating PO's. Majority of medications switched to PO and
had another round of hemodialysis.  POD7: Hemodialysis deferred
per renal. No repeat attempt for PICC placement.  POD8-13:
Patient was placed on M/W/F hemodialysis schedule and cleared by
renal for discharge with hemodialysis. Previously noted
sundowning improved.  Patient reported intermittent diarrhea, C.
diff negative, noted to have previous history of diarrhea
requiring lomotil.  On POD12, a tunneled hemodialysis catheter
was placed and abdominal and left lower extremity staples
removed with steristrips placed.  Patient was discharged to
rehabilitation facility presently requiring M/W/F hemodialysis
in stable condition.
