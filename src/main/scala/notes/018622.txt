CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Confusion and hypoxia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old,
African-American male with a history of mild mental
retardation, depression, psychosis, asthma, and restrictive
lung disease on a home oxygen requirement of three liters.
He presented from home after feeling confused this morning.
At baseline, Mr. [**Known lastname **]' pulmonary disease leaves him with a
chronic, nonproductive cough and limits him from walking any
length of time or climbing stairs.  He was in his usual state
of health until the morning of admission when he awoke and
felt confused and lethargic.  He was unable to eat his
breakfast which he states demonstrates a major deviation from
baseline.  According to his mentor, he has had episodes of
confusion where he is unable to recall the day of the week.
This has been happening intermittently over the course of the
week prior to admission.

Upon arrival to the Emergency Department, his oxygen
saturation was 97 percent on three liters oxygen.  At the
time of this interview, he denied worsening shortness of
breath, and in fact, says that this is a good day for his
breathing.  He also denies increase in the severity of his
cough from baseline, chest pain, pleuritic chest pain,
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, bright red
blood per rectum, abdominal pain, dysuria, fever, chills,
night sweats or unexplained loss of weight.

The patient has had a medication change in the past couple of
weeks.  His outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23168**],
discontinued his Paxil and risperidone and started him on
Zyprexa 15 mg q.6:00 p.m. instead.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a known
mixed restrictive obstructive lung disease of unknown
etiology and is followed by the pulmonary team at [**Hospital1 346**], in particular by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4648**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.

His baseline chest x-ray shows an interstitial pattern with a
patchy infiltrate on the left lower lobe.  He has a history
of multiple presentations to this hospital with symptoms of
shortness of breath, confusion, and chest x-rays that show an
interstitial pattern.  He has been treated empirically
multiple times for pneumonia and asthma flares.  He was
intubated once in [**2101**] at which time he had a pneumonia with
empyema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is
significant for restrictive lung disease with his last
pulmonary function test on [**2106-2-5**] with an FEV1 of 0.92
liters, 36 percent of predicted and an FVC of 1.5 liters
which is 36 percent of predicted.  His TLC is 40 percent of
predicted, and DLCO 15 percent of predicted as reported on
[**2105-10-21**].  His oxygen saturations tend to run approximately
91 percent in room air.  It decreases to 86 percent in room
air with exercise.  He is followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
the Pulmonary Service.   It is unclear of the exact nature of
his disease.  It may be a complicated picture including an
interstitial lung process of unknown etiology as well as
obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, and possibly a neuromuscular
disorder as well.

The patient has a history of Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus and pneumonia.  He had a last empyema
which required thoracotomy and decortication in 02/[**2101**].  He
was intubated and required hospitalization in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit at that time.

He also has a history of hypertension.  The patient had an
electrocardiogram in [**1-/2106**] which showed a right ventricular
dilation.  He has a history of depression with psychosis.
The patient is noted to have a self-inflicted abdominal wound
where he stabbed himself in the stomach in [**2100**].  It was
apparently after his father had passed away.  He was admitted
for psychiatric hospitalization in [**2102**] with auditory
hallucinations and again in [**5-/2105**] with a hypomanic episode.
He has a history of mild mental retardation, history of
gastrointestinal bleed from internal hemorrhoids, total left
hip replacement status post septic arthritis of that hip,
hernia repair, cervical stenosis of C3-4 with bilateral hand
weakness.

He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea which was
confirmed by a sleep study prior to admission.  He has a
history of corneal ulcer status post right corneal
transplant.  He has stasis dermatitis on bilateral lower
extremities followed by Dermatology with negative
.................... in the past.

MEDICATIONS:  His medications on admission included albuterol
two puffs q.i.d., Flovent two puffs b.i.d., Singular ten
puffs p.o. q.h.s., Serevent two puffs t.i.d., [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Cardura 2 mg p.o. q.h.s., Monopril 10 mg p.o.
q.day, Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day, Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.a.m.,
600 mg p.o. q.h.s., Zyprexa 15 mg p.o. q.6:00 p.m., Tylenol
100 mg p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n., Detrol 2 mg p.o. q.day,
prednisolone acetate eye drops one drop to both eyes t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic diltiazem and lactose.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His father died of a myocardial infarction
at age 87.  Mother died of cancer.  The patient also reports
asthma in his sister.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has attended special needs
classes through the ninth grade and worked in hospitals as a
housekeeper.  He is currently in a mentor program and lives
with a family and attends the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13089**] Center five days
per week.  He has a caseworker whose name is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4427**].  He
states he has a number of friends at the senior center
program and denies drug and alcohol use now and in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature on admission was 99.3,
blood pressure 104/77, pulse 104, respiratory rate 18, oxygen
saturation 97 percent on three liters oxygen nasal cannula.
Generally, he was awake and alert, breathing comfortably,
pleasant, oriented to place and cooperative with exam.  HEENT
exam revealed pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light,
extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, moist mucous
membranes.  His neck had no jugular venous distention and was
supple with full range of motion.

His lungs revealed some inspiratory crackles, left greater
than right and decreased lung sounds at the right base.
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm,
slightly tachycardiac, normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or
gallops appreciated.  His abdomen had a large midline scar,
positive bowel sounds, soft and obese, nontender and
nondistended.  His extremities had evidence of chronic stasis
dermatitis, no edema or cyanosis, and his neurological exam
was nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, his white count was 6.4,
hematocrit 34.9, platelets 240.  Sodium 144, potassium 5.4,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 33, BUN 38, creatinine 1.4, glucose
91, CK 242, MB 7, troponin of less than 0.3, ALT 102, AST 53,
alkaline phosphatase 376, total bilirubin 0.3, theophylline
4.6.  His urinalysis was unremarkable.  Chest x-ray shows
slight left ventricular enlargement, right pleural effusion,
and a lower lobe infiltrate possibly consistent with
consolidation.

His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 109 beats
per minute with a normal axis and some new T wave inversions
changed from prior electrocardiogram in leads V2-V4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Briefly, this is a 52-year-old male with
severe asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, restrictive lung
disease, and a psychiatric history with a recent psychiatric
medication change who presented with episodes of confusion,
lethargy, and hypercarbia.

PROBLEM #1:  Pulmonary: The patient was admitted with
confusion and elevated bicarbonate.  His pulmonary picture
was likely multifactorial.  He has a history of obstructive
sleep apnea confirmed by a sleep study as well as both severe
restrictive lung disease of unknown etiology and asthma.  The
patient also has a history of multiple elevated CK enzymes in
the past thought to be from a muscle source as well as a
markedly abnormal EMG which r
