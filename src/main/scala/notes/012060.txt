Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
ASA desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization ([**2131-12-24**])
Intubation ([**2131-12-25**])


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 73-yo man w/ severe COPD and recently-diagnosed
cardiomyopathy with EF 30% who presented to OSH on [**2131-12-21**]
with complaints of increasing SOB, DOE, orthopnea, PND, chest
tightness, and wheezing. He denied any chest pain, palpitations,
lightheadedness, syncope, lower extremity edema, fevers, chills,
cough, or sputum production. He was treated as an acute on
chronic CHF exacerbation with diuresis as well as a COPD
exacerbation with steroids and nebulizers. He was seen by
Cardiology and Pulmonology consults, and repeat TTE showed an
LVEF of 20-25% with global LV hypokinesis and chamber
dilatation, and the possibility of an apical thrombus could not
be ruled out. He was started on weight-based heparin gtt and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiac Cath Lab for catheterization.
Catheterization here showed diffuse 20-30% stenosis with
mid-vessel 80% stenosis of the LAD and mild luminal
irregularities with mid-vessel 60% eccentric stenosis of the
LCx. Given his ASA allergy, he is admitted to the CCU for ASA
desensitization and investigation of viability of the
anteroapical wall in anticipation of probable PCI of the LAD
lesion.
.
On arrival to the CCU: VS - Temp 97.6F, BP 125/93, HR 94, R 22,
SaO2 97% 2L NC. He complains of mild left groin pain at the
catheterization site.
.
ROS: He acknowledges a prior history of TIA but denies any
history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding
at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.

Past Medical History:
- severe COPD / bronchial asthma
- cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30-35%, cause unknown
- suspected TIA
- h/o recent pneumonia
- LBBB on ECG
- nephrolithiasis
- s/p cataract surgery
- s/p hernia repair


Social History:
Lives with his wife, fairly independent until symptomatic w/
SOB.
-Tobacco history: x15-20years, Quit smoking: [**2104**]

ECG ([**2131-12-24**]): Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats and
possible first beat being a ventricular premature beat. Left
bundle-branch block. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
CARDIAC CATH ([**2131-12-24**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
one vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout
with a
mid vessel 80% stenosis. The Lcx had mild luminal irregularities
with a
mid vessel 60% eccentric stenosis. The RCA was small and
nondominant
without any angiographically apparent stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling
pressures
with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary
hypertension with
a pulmonary artery pressure of 47/21 mmHg. There were moderately

elevated left sided filling pressures with a PCWP mean of 24
mmHg. There
was normal central aortic pressures of 126/77 mmHg. The cardiac
index
was normal at 2.9 L/min/m2.
3. Left vetriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. Moderate diastolic dysfunction.
4. Elevated RVEDP
.
CXR ([**2131-12-24**]):
1. Hazy opacity in the lingula and left lower lobe, concerning
for early pneumonia versus asymmetric edema.
2. Cardiomegaly. Mild vascular congestion with interstitial
edema.
3. Right retrocardiac density, atelectasis versus pneumonia. PA
and lateral views are recommended for better assessment of this
area.
.
TTE ([**2131-12-25**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**10-9**] %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricular cavity with severe global
hypokinesis. Preserved right ventricular cavity size and
systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2131-12-26**]):
1. There is no evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Marked asymmetric enlargement of the proximal right thigh
musculature, consistent with the patient's history of a known
hematoma.
3. Small left greater than right pleural effusions with
associated compressive atelectasis of the posterior lung bases.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. Extensive colonic diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis.
.
Femoral Vascular U/S ([**2131-12-26**]):
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or A-V fistula,
as questioned. There is a large right groin/thigh hematoma as
seen on CT, measuring at least 13.0 cm in greatest dimension.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm of AVF. Large right
groin/thigh hematoma.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with severe COPD and
recently-diagnosed cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, who presented to
an OSH on [**2131-12-21**] with symptoms of acute on chronic systolic
heart failure, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization
to assess for ischemic cardiomyopathy, which showed LAD disease.
He was admitted to the CCU for aspirin desensitization with plan
for repeat cardiac catheterization and PCI.
.
#. Aspirin desensitization - The patient was admitted to the CCU
overnight for aspirin desensitization. He completed the protocol
overnight, but approximately 1 hour after completion he suffered
from acute-onset of severe respiratory distress with chest
tightness and wheezing, consistent with anaphylaxis. He was
treated with steroids, H1- and H2-blockers, as well as
treatments directed at his COPD, CHF, and anxiety, with no
improvement, so he was intubated for respiratory failure. He was
extubated later that day with significant improvement. He was
seen by the Allergy
