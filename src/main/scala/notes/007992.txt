   RADIOLOGY

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2156-4-7**] 10:22 PM

INDICATION: 47-year-old man with known pericarditis, 14 days
post-op from open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Eval nausea and
vomiting.
SUPINE AND ERECT RADIOGRAPHS OF THE ABDOMEN: There is normal
abdominal bowel gas pattern. No definite evidence for bowel
dilatation is seen. There are no air-fluid levels. The osseous
structures appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2156-4-7**] 10:22 PM

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

SMALL BOWEL ONLY (BARIUM)  [**2156-4-9**] 4:43 PM

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pt too large for fluro swallow study but needs swallow with
serial abd x-rays to eval for UGI obstruction.
HISTORY: 47-year-old man with known pericardidis 14 days postop
from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, now with nausea.

Seven abdominal radiographs including AP, lateral and oblique
projections were obtained.

The initial radiographs were taken after the administration of
oral gastrografin and demonstrate free passage of contrast
through the esophagus and into the gastric remnant without
evidence of anastomotic leak. Subsequent images were obtained
after the administration of thin barium showing normal caliber
small and large bowel with rapid transit of barium through to
the descending colon in approximately 20 minutes. There is no
evidence of obstruction. Surgical clips are noted over the right
upper quadrant. Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of anastomotic leak or obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the MIS surgical service where he was
conservatively managed with IV hydration, stage II diet, prn
anzemet and compazine.  His levo was changed to IV, and he ws
observed.  On the night of HD1 he had one episode of dryheaves,
but his frequency of vomitting (with the antiemetic regimen) was
noted to be dramatically less than the 12 times in one day that
he noted on admission.  None the less we made him NPO in an
attempt to avoid all nausea/wreching on staple lines.  A UGI was
performed which showed no mechanical abnormality to explain his
recurrent nausea.  Pt was slowly advanced to a stage III diet
(which he was able to tolerate) and was discharged home on HD4.
