Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right femoral venous catheter insertion [**2134-5-8**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F hx dCHF, recurrent UTI, afib on coumadin presents from
home with visiting nurse (with whom she lives) with AMS. Per
report through interpreter, the patient is currently oriented
x2, but was unable to provide much of a history. Her VNA nurse
called an ambulance when she was found listless in bed. She
arrived to the ED alone.
.
Vital signs in the ED:  103.8  165  151/127  16  95 on 4L
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt's BP dropped to 80s/60s.  Her UA was noted to be
consistent with UTI.  Pt has a history of UTIs in the past, all
sensitive organisms (Klebsiella, citrobacter, E. Coli).
.
A CVL (R-IJ) was attempted but the pt was uncooperative.  She
was given 1.5 L bolus without improvement in her BP.  She was
started empirically on vancomycin & zosyn.  She was given 1000
mg IV acetaminophin.  She was given 5 mg IV metoprolol for rapid
atrial fibrillation
.
Pertinent labs in the ED included lactate 7.6, creatinine 1.7,
troponin 0.06, INR 6.1. Blood cultures were sent from the ED.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2134-5-8**]
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are again low and absence of lateral
limits
assessment. Bilateral upper lung opacities are seen and more
pronounced than on the previous examination. On the prior study,
they were suggested to be pleural-based based on their
appearance on the lateral, although this assessment is not
possible today. Given that opacities have increased over time
suspicion is high for possible malignancy. Additionally, subtle
infectious process would be difficult to exclude in these areas.
Calcified
granuloma in the right lower lung is again demonstrated. The
heart size
remains top normal with calcified aortic knob. Degenerative
changes are noted at the right AC and glenohumeral joints.
IMPRESSION: Increase in size of left greater than right upper
lung, possibly pleural-based based on the prior examination,
opacities for which further evaluation by CT is recommended.
Malignancy is of concern.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F w dCHF, recurrent UTIs presents with septic shock,
suspected urinary origin.

CC: sepsis
HPI: she denies chest pain or shortness of breath.  she is OK
with going to rehab and she does not recall going there before.
she recognizes how weak she is and how she needs 24h care and
that she will benefit from rehab.  I spoke with Mark (grand-son)
and that our recommendation is that she goes to rehab and that
as she recovers then he can plan on bringing her home with more
services, especially as he can not visit her till next friday.
ROS: afebrile, no chest pain
PMH: CHF

discharge exam EXAM:97.2 119/72 HR 74 18 96 RA
lung sounds clear without crackles or wheezes
irregular s1 and s2
soft, non-distended/non-tender abdomen
trace peripheral edema

DATA
INR 4.1, Creat 0.8
I personally reviewed her chest CT with radiology demonstrating
bilateral chest masses

Medical Decision Making:

#SEPTIC SHOCK: Pt presented with SBP in 90s which was
unresponsive to fluids (but only received 1.5L) and lactate of
7.6. Pt was initially started on levophed which was discontinued
prior to ICU admission. Urinalysis showed evidence of UTI. Pt
was started on vanc/zosyn for presumed urinary source. Shy was
transferred out of the ICU to the medical floor on [**5-9**].  Blood
cultures and urine cultures both grew pan-sensitive E.Coli.
Repeat blood culture is negative.  She was transitioned from
Zosyn to Ciprofloxacin on [**5-11**] and will complete a 10d course to
end on [**5-19**].

# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Creatinine 1.7 on admission from apparent
baseline of 0.9-1.0 (last [**2134-4-28**]).  This is most likely
prerenal in etiology given hypotension on admission and FeUrea
of 29%. Pt maintained normal urine output. Home lasix was held
initially.  As of [**5-12**], her creatinine improved to 0.8.

# Supratherapeutic INR: INR on admission 6.1.  Pt was unaware of
her coumadin dose but stated she does take it at [**Last Name (un) **]. She has a
VNA nurse administering her medications.  Poor nutritional
status and sepsis may have contributed to supratherapeutic INR.
Warfarin was held. Pt was given Vitamin K on admission due to
elevated INR and antibiotics administration. INR trended down
and is 2.3 as of [**5-10**], so coumadin was resumed at 2.5mg (home
dose), but INR was 4.1 after 2 doses, so coumadin will be held
until INR trends back down.  *Please note that cipro dosing is
likely to cause elevated levels.

# ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES: Troponin elevated to 0.06 on
admission.  Unfortunately, there was no documented EKG at that
time.  Given that her HR was 165 on admission, it was felt
likely that her elevated troponin is due to rate-related demand
ischemia or acute renal failure. Troponin trended down after
admission.

# Atrial Fibrillation:  Was in rapid afib in the ED which
resolveed after 5 mg IV metoprolol. Pt has a history of atrial
fibrillation. Metoprolol was held in setting of hypotension.
Last TSH was normal (3.1) on [**2134-4-28**]. Her CHADS2 score is 5
(age, CHF, DM2, prior CVA); she is on coumadin as an outpatient.
Coumadin was held see supratherapeutic INR above.  Pt was
monitored on telemetry in the ICU. HR ranged between 90-1teens.
Coumadin was resumed on [**5-11**], but held on discharge for INR > 4.0
 Metoprolol was resumed in TID dosing on [**5-11**].

#Lung mass: Pt previously noted on CXR [**3-21**] to have bilateral
pleural opacifications in the upper lung fields. On admission
these appeared slightly increased from prior.  As far as our
records indicate, she has not had these opacifications
evaluated.  A chest CT documented large bilateral pulmonary
masses with an appearance concerning for malignancy though given
the rapid change in appearance on CXR radiology also felt a
fungal infection could also be on the differential.  I spoke
with the patient and her daughter regarding this fidnings on [**5-11**]
and also updated her PCP via the phone.  I spoke with patient
with translator and she does not want this mass to be biopsied.
The family is in agreement with this and all questions were
answered, though I r
