History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year old male with ESRD, on dialysis for the last
18 months. In [**2187-8-20**], he was admitted with CHF and found to
have severe three vessel coronary disease. ECHO at that time
showed severely depressed LV function with an EF 20-25% and only
1+MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was concomitantly treated with antibiotics for a
pneumonia. He was not an ideal surgical candidate at that time
and was eventually discharged on medical therapy.

On day prior to admission, he presented to OSH in pulmonary
edema. He ruled in for an acute MI with elevated troponins. He
was treated with Nitro and Lasix with improvement in symptoms.
He was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and treatment. On admission, his shortness of breath
improved. He denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting, orthopnea, PND
and palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, cardiac enzymes remained flat. Cardiac surgery was
consulted for surgical revascularization as multivessel PCI was
not an option. Antiplatelet therapy was therefore discontinued
and Warfarin was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP. He was
subsequently started on IV Heparin. Once his prothrombin time
improved, it was decided to proceed with surgical
revascularization. He otherwise remained pain free on medical
therapy and continued on his routine dialysis schedule.

On [**2187-9-21**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting. Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU
for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He
initially required inotropes for blood pressure support. By POD
#2, he weaned from intravenous therapy. He maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on POD #3. He
experienced bouts of paroxsymal atrial fibrillation. Warfarin
therapy was eventually resumed
