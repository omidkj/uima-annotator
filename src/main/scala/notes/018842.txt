Metatstatic osteogenic sarcoma; SVC syndrome

History of Present Illness:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY. T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma over
20
years ago, treated and cured with radiation and chemotherapy.
Radiation included mediastinum and chest.

Diagnosed with primary MFH (malignant fibrous histocytoma) of
the
bone (left tibia) in [**2193-6-24**]. Received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy with cisplatin/adriamycin (AP), and had definitive
resection in [**2193-11-24**]. Operative specimen showed
suboptimal necrosis (only 5% necrosis) and her postoperative
chemotherapy was switched to AP alternating with IE
(ifosfamide/etoposide). Finished chemotherapy in [**2194-2-22**].
She was treated by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 18**]. Her chemotherapy
course was complicated by profound myelosuppression and
mucositis/esophagitis.

HPI. Presents with worsening dyspnea (particularly on exertion),
fatigue, and upper body/facial edema over the last several days.
The patient was followed in Buffalo, NY, since she finished
chemotherapy.  She apparently was noted to have small lung
nodule
or nodules in early [**2194**] by imaging. This was followed by
observation and in [**2195-5-24**] one of the nodules became very
large
(over 10 cm) and began to cause symptoms. She had a telephone
discussion with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and she decided to pursue
options including possible surgery in Buffalo [**Location (un) 63519**]
Institute. However, the symptoms got quickly worse, and one of
the lesions, apparently mediastinal in location, began to cause
SVC type symptoms.

She was treated with palliative XRT to the mediastinal mass to
18
[**Doctor Last Name **], finished on or around [**8-3**].  She was also started
on gemcitabine/docetaxel as 3rd line sarcoma therapy. Due to
extensive prior chemotherapy for her hematologic malignancy and
osteosarcoma and previous serious myelosuppression with AP and
IE, she was started on a 50% dose of gemcitabine and did NOT
receive docetaxel for her 1st cycle.  She receive day 1 of her
2nd cycle last Saturday ([**8-15**]) and was scheduled to
receive day 8 (gemcitabine and docetaxel) next Saturday in
Buffalo. She has received neulasta even with gemcitabine out of
fear for myelosuppression.

She decided to transfer her care back to [**Hospital1 18**]. She feels that
her shortness of breath, particularly when she tries to ambulate
is worse, and that her face and left arm have begun to swell up
over the last 2 days.  She is reasonably comfortable at rest,
but uses oxygen 6-8 hours every day for the last few days.

Seen in clinic today and was admitted to the hospital for
aggressive palliative treatment of her progressive symptoms.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient states that she also has
some increased chest pain in the midsternal area over the past 2
days. Not pleuritic in nature.  Does not describe any acute
worsening of her respiratory status, though is tachypneic at
rest.  She additionally describes worsening fatigue, with more
difficulty with movement.

Past Medical History:
--T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma 20 years ago treated with chemo
and mediastinal irradiation
--Osteosarcoma of the proximal left tibia s/p 2 cycles of
Adriamycin and Cisplatin in [**9-28**] and [**10-28**], complicated by
febrile neutropenia, espophagitis, s/p radical resection on
[**2193-12-23**]
--Cecal volvulus s/p right partial colectomy
--Thyroidectomy [**12-26**] thyroid nodules ([**12-26**] mediastinal radiation)
--ARF, pre-renal, resolved
--UE DVT [**12-26**] PICC

Social History:
Works as rad tech. Now not working. Lives in [**Hospital1 **] with a
friend. [**Name (NI) **] tobacco, alcohol or drugs. Married, but her husband
is living in [**Name (NI) 531**] (her state of residence.) Mother is local,
and very involved in her care.


Family History:
Significant for HTN. No coagulopathy. Hx of cancer in two
maternal aunts of unknown type. No sarcomas.

Physical Exam:
Vitals BP107/68  Pulse 124  Temp afebrile RR 23 O2 no pulsus
sats 99% on 2L.
Facial edema. No jaundice, no skin rash. Tongue coated with some
green/whie exudate. No lymphadenopathy.
Lungs, clear,with reduced breath sounds on right
Heart regular, but tachycardic. no m/r/g
Abdomen, soft non tender.
Extremeties: Left upper: edema from the elbow down. No leg
edema,
well healed surgical scar in left tibia.

STUDIES:
CT CHEST with CONTRAST IMPRESSION [**8-20**]:
1) 16 x 15 x 10cm, new prevascular mediastinal mass occluding a
long segment of the superior vena cava, severely compromising
the right bronchial tree and right lung pulmonary circulation
invading the pericardium, accompanied by new and/or enlarging
right lung nodules and bilateral pleural effusions.
2) Well-developed collateral venous circulation reflecting
superior vena cava syndrome.
3) Segmental pulmonary embolus, left lower lobe.
.

ECHO [**8-20**]:The left and right atria appear compressed by an
extrinsic mass. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. Mitral
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2193-12-20**], the atria now appear compressed by an
extrinsic mass.
.
INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY VISUALIZATION OF VEINS IMPRESSION [**8-21**]:

1) Recent thrombosis of the left and right subclavian and
brachiocephalic veins, due to severe encasement of the SVC.
2)A 12 mm x 8 cm stent was placed in the SVC and extended with a
10 mm x 6 cm stent into the left brachiocephalic vein with good
angiographic results.
.
[**8-20**] Bilateral LENIs: negative
.
CXR [**8-23**]:
Markedly increased bilateral basal consolidations are seen
accompanied by bilateral increase in pleural effusion. This
consolidations might be either due to bibasilar atelectasis or
massive aspiration. Mild pulmonary edema is seen.
There is no change in the position of the right central venous
line.
Unchanged position of the central venous stent.
