History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 yo M with PMH of CAD/CABG, DM, CRI, AAA/TAA
repair, multiple CVA, seizure d/o who presented to the ED w/
respiratory distress. Son reports 4 days of lethargy, decreased
POs, 'not walking at all,' and wet, non-productive cough. He
also reports subjective fever the morning of admission. His son
states that his father did not complain of any chest pain,
abdominal pain or dysuria. He has had normal bowel movements. He
lives at home with wife and was seen there today by NP who
referred him to the ED. He denied abdominal
pain/nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/CP/SOB.

On arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt was tachypneic w/ RR 35, BP 198/122, T 101.2
rectally, sats 70s on RA, 85 on NRB, RLL crackles and rhonchi.
He had a CXR that showed multilobar pneumonia. He was intubated
for respiratory distress with VBG showing 7.28/50/56. Other
significant labs were; BNP 2458, Trop 0.06, Lactate 3.4. His
blood pressure had been in the high 100's systolic and dropped
initially to 90's then to 54/33 after receiving propofol. He
then received 6L NS and peripheral dopa was started. A RIJ
placed and started on central levophed and dopamine per sepsis
protocol (on low dose for both (124/70). He received Levaquin
750mg IV and Ceftriaxone 1gm and was consented for sepsis
research study.

On arrival to floor, ABG was 7.32/45/327 on AC @100% w/ PEEP 10
and FiO2 was decreased to 60. He was started on fentanyl/versed
gtt for sedation, and dopa and levo for BP support.

REPORTS AND STUDIES

ECHO [**3-21**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is
normal (LVEF 60-70%); however, the basal segments of the
inferior septum, inferior free wall, and posterior wall are
hypokinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is moderately dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2119-5-6**], the mitral regurgitation appears reduced;
however, this suboptimal study may have underestimated the
mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2121-4-1**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-31**], there is little overall
change. Tubes remain in place in this patient with median
sternotomy and pacemaker leads. Hazy opacification of the lower
half of the right hemithorax is again seen, consistent with
pleural fluid. Some asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the
right, is suggested.

CXR [**2121-4-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
single lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic venous
approach. Final internal length is 43 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 yo M with PMH of CAD/CABG, DM, CRI, AAA/TAA repair,
multiple CVA who presented initially with RLL pneumonia,
admitted to the MICU intubated [**3-1**] to respiratory distress and
hypotension, extubated briefly, then reintubated secondary to
increased secretions.
.
#) Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Upon initial presentation, the
patient had had 4 days of lethargy, and increased cough with
inability to clear sputum.  The patient was intubated initially
and started on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.  Flagyl was
additionally added; The patient's vent was titrated according to
ABGs.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued  on [**3-25**].  The patient was
extubated on [**3-26**], but required reintubation the subsequent day
for respiratory distress, presumed secondary to thick
secretions.  A pneumonia was seen on CXR, and the patient was
started on zosyn and vancomycin.  The patient had a trach, PEG
and central line placed on [**2-/2042**].  Pressure support was weaned as
tolerated, but he may require more ventilator support for
transport.  Zosyn and vancomycin are to be continued for an 8
day course for PNA. Zosyn and vanc are to be given via PICC for
1 more days for 8 days total.  PICC lines was placed on [**2118-4-2**]
and is ok for use.  Last day of vancomycin and zosyn will be
[**2121-4-4**].
.
#) Hypotension/Sepsis:  On initial presentation, pt was
hypertensive to 200s/100s, but BP began to drop after
intubation.  IV dopamine and fluids were started, BP increased.
The patient was pan-cultured.  The patient's pressors were
weaned and fluid boluses were given as necessary. Resolved.
.
#) Hypernatremia: Initial sodium was 160.  The patient did not
appear volume-overloaded on arrival to the medical floor despite
receiving 6 L NS.  Most likely cause was thought to be
dehydration from not drinking water.  The free water deficit was
calculated and the patient was given free water to bring his
sodium down.  His electrolytes were closely monitored.  He can
continue to get free water with his tube feeds as needed.
.
#) A-fib/A-flutter: pt has a history of this, controlled on
sotolol and metoprolol. During admission, he went into a-fib
with rvr and a-flutter but this wsa controlled with uptitration
of medications including calcium channel blocker & beta blocker.

- Continue lopressor and diltiazam for control (can titrate up
if needed)
.
#) Renal Failure: Cr 1.8 on admission, elevated BUN/Cr ratio
suggests at least partial pre-renal etiology although pt has
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline Cr of 1.6. Currently,
creatinine stable and at baseline, creatinine 1.3 at discharge.

.
#) Mental Status - Pt still remains largely unarousable despite
being off of sedating medications. Per discussion with family,
his baseline is poor to start.
