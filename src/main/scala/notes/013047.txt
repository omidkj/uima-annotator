Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Pancreatitis, Choledocolithiasis, Probable Cholangitis,
Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) with stent
and sphincterotomy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old gentleman normally cared for at the
West Have [**Hospital1 65180**], who is transferred from [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital for
concern of acute cholangitis, pancreatitis, probable
cholecystitis.

The patient began having pain in his abdomen while he was
driving his car on the day prior to admission. He denies similar
pain in the past. He reports yellow, non-bloody emesis but is
unable to provide further details. He denies fevers, chills,
chest pain, difficulty breathing, bloody, or black stools. He
had a brown bowel movement on the morning his symptoms began. He
was evaluated at [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital where a CT of his abdomen raised
concern for biliary obstruction. He was therefore transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for possible ERCP.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vital signs were: Tm 99.4 79 199/76 18 95%.
On exam, he was tender in his right upper quandrant but he did
not have [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign. He underwent RUQ ultrasound, which
revealed a dilated common bile duct at 1.4cm with mild
intrahepatic ductal dilation. No definite CBD stone was seen,
but there was sludge in the gall bladder. A CT abdomen was
concerning for acute cholecystitis. The patient was seen by both
surgery and ERCP, and the decision was made to pursue ERCP and
reassess the patient after ERCP to determine whether he would
need cholecystectomy. He was given 3L of IV fluids and started
on unasyn before being admitted to the ICU for further care.

Upon arrival in the ICU, he was sleepy and somewhat disoriented.
He initially denied any abdominal pain, then pointed to his
epigastric area saying it had been hurting all day and continued
to hurt. He then denied pain again. His greatest concern was
that he was very thirsty. He denied back pain or headache.
