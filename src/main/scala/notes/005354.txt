Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old
male with past medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia,
who presented to an outside hospital complaining of a four
day history of shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
During those four days the patient noticed that he had
increasing cough and a significant increase in dyspnea on
exertion where his exercise tolerance decreased from a 15 to
30 minutes walk to five minutes before becoming very short of
breath.  The patient denied having "chest pain," described
having radiating pain from "stomach" up to the right jaw.
The patient admits to orthopnea, but denies paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  At the
outside hospital the patient was noted to have EKG changes
with ST elevations in leads V1 to V4.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
urgent therapy.  In the emergency department the patient
received Lopressor, nitroglycerin drip and heparin drip and
was urgently transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
dyslipidemia, chronic left lower extremity edema more than
two years ago.

ALLERGIES:  The patient denies having any known drug
allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Medications at home include hydrochlorothiazide
25 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q.d., atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a smoking history of one
pack per week for over 30 years.  Denies alcohol abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for heart disease in great-
grandparents.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission afebrile at 98.1, heart
rate 85, blood pressure 156/82, 96 percent on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  Alert and oriented times three, Cantonese speaking,
not in apparent distress.  HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic.
Supple neck.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  No jugular
venous distention, no carotid bruits noted.  Chest exam
occasional expiratory wheezes, rales in lateral lung fields
bilaterally.  Cardiac regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no
murmurs were appreciated.  Abdomen soft, nondistended,
nontender, no rebound, no guarding.  Extremities 1+ lower
extremity edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG on admission sinus tachycardia at 107,
normal axis, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V1 and V2, [**Street Address(2) 2051**]
elevation in V2 to V4, Q wave in V1 and poor R wave
progression.  Compared with the last known EKG in [**2156-3-18**],
ST segment elevation in V2 and V3 as well as Q wave in V1 are
new.  On admission white count 9.7, hematocrit 42.8,
platelets 245.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.3, chloride 103, CO2
20, BUN 15, creatinine 0.9, glucose 181.  [**Name (NI) 2591**] PT 14.2, PTT
30.0, INR 1.3.  Cardiac enzymes CK 204, MB 7, troponin less
than 0.01.  Chest x-ray on admission showed early upper zone
insufficiency, left more than right, small left sided pleural
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was originally taken to the
cardiac catheterization lab whereupon the patient was found
to have severe coronary artery disease with left main,
diffuse, 50 to 60 percent stenosis and diffuse proximal
disease of the LAD and total occlusion at mid-LAD, total
occlusion at the origin of the LCX with collateral filling of
the OM1, proximal total occlusion of the RCA with right to
left and left to right collaterals.  Given the severe three
vessel disease and left main disease, the patient was placed
on an intra-aortic balloon pump prophylactically.  In
addition, given the right dominant coronary anatomy, the RCA
was dilated serially in the mid and proximal segments with
the restoration of TIMI-3 flow.  Three Hepaco stents were
placed with documentation of 70 percent PDA lesion appearing
to be stable and adequate outflow at the PL branches.  Left
ventricular ejection fraction was calculated at 15 percent at
the time of catheterization.

Given the severe disease with total occlusion of three
cardiac vessels as well as left main disease, cardiac surgery
was consulted.  Post procedure the patient was supported with
nitro drip and Integrilin drip and supported with aspirin and
heparin.  There was a concern, given the severe extent of the
disease as well as the ejection fraction of 15 percent,
whether there were viable cardiac muscle cells to be rescued
by coronary artery bypass graft.  Viability of the anterior
wall was documented by thallium reperfusion study which
showed viable cells at the distal anterior wall.  After the
patient was medically stabilized, the patient was taken to
the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2161-5-6**] whereupon the
patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft times four
with LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to PDA, saphenous vein
graft to PLV, saphenous vein graft to OM.  Total time on
cardiopulmonary bypass was 87 minutes, cross clamp time was
73 minutes.  Please see the operative report for further
details.

In the immediate post-op period the patient did well and did
not have immediate complications.  The patient was weaned off
pressors without difficulty and was extubated without
problems.  However, during the course of postoperative day
one the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation which was
treated with amiodarone.  The patient converted to sinus
rhythm and was transferred out to the floor on postoperative
day three.  The patient did well otherwise.  His Lopressor
dose was slowly increased to 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., given the
low ejection fraction.  The patient had mildly elevated
finger stick values despite being four days out from surgery
and was evaluated by [**Last Name (un) **] physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] the patient's
new onset of diabetes, it was determined that the patient
should be seen in the clinic for dietary and nutritional
education before starting on any oral hypoglycemics or
insulin.

The patient remained stable and is discharged on
postoperative day five, alert and oriented times three, not
in apparent distress.  Cardiac exam regular S1, S2, in sinus
rhythm.  Lungs were clear to auscultation.  Sternum was
clean, dry and intact and stable without discharge.  There
was no lower extremity edema.  Laboratory studies on
discharge included white count 9.8, hematocrit 30.5,
platelets 227.  Chemistries sodium 135, potassium 3.8,
chloride 103, CO2 24, BUN 13, creatinine 0.8, glucose 131.
Pre-op total cholesterol was 163, LDL 112, HDL 31,
triglycerides 102.
