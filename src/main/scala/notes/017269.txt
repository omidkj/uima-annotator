.
CXR: The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
Compared to the prior study, there are new multifocal
consolidative opacities involving the left lower and the entire
right lung, consistent with multifocal pneumonia. No sizable
effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal consolidative process, most consistent
with multifocal pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
This is a 61 yo w/h/o DM1, s/p cadaveric kidney
transplant([**2175**]), h/o CVA and chronic aspiration with recent
admission for multifocal pneumonia who presented to the ED with
a recurrence of multifocal PNA and later was admitted to the
MICU with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring ET intubation
and mechanical ventilation that was later replaced with a
tracheostomy. He also developed lower extremity tremors
attributed to his prior CVAs and acute mental status
deterioration likely due to progression of his previous CV
infarcts and his hypoxic respiratory failure.

# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: the patient most likely had an
aspiration event resulting in an aspiration/multifocal PNA. This
is considered a recurrence in this patient since he had a recent
discharge for the same problem. Also, pt w/known h/o chronic
aspiration, will cover for anaerobes. He also may have had some
volume overload leading to pulmonary edema.
All 4 blood cx's from admission on [**7-30**] were negative. He had a
sputum cx/BAL x2 which was significant only for + HSV-1 cx/IF.
It also showed no bacterial/fungal/mycobacterial growth or
influenza positivity. His urine legionella was also negative. He
was also given albuterol/ipratropium nebs. He was covered w/
Zosyn/Vancomycin/Ciprofloxacin for presumed HAP when the lobar
collapse was noted on CXR on [**8-6**]. His CXRs afterwards remained
clear, and his antibiotics were stopped when his sputum cx's had
been negative for 72 hours. He also showed some evidence of
pulmonary edema on CXR, which was initially treated w/ Lasix.
After the development of an erythematous rash on his chest and
upper extremities, he was started on ethycrinic acid with good
diuretic effect, w/ goal Is = Os. He reached this goal and the
diuresis was discontinued. He was weaned off sedation, and then
a tracheostomy and PEG were placed. His oxygen saturations
remained at 98-100% on trach mask with FiO2 of 40%. He was
continued on bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], given his immunosuppression
for the renal transplant.

# Sepsis [**3-11**] Line Infection: Pt began experiencing fevers, an
elevated leucocytosis, and episodes of hypotension. Broad
spectrum abx (Vancy/Zosyn/Cipro) were started, and pt was
pan-cultured. A blood cx from [**8-13**] drawn from a PICC line placed
[**8-1**] came back positive for coagulase negative staph. His PICC
line was removed. His fevers, WBC, and hypotension resolved w/
removal of the line and abx treatment. Zosyn and Cipro were
d/c-ed He will be continued on a 2 week course of Vancomycin
which was started on [**2180-8-13**] and will end on [**2180-8-27**]. His
metoprolol was held, and then re-started at a lower dose (50
[**Hospital1 **]) when his BPs resolved. The beta blocker can be titrated up
to his original dose of 100 [**Hospital1 **] as tolerated.

# CKD s/p cadaveric renal transplant: A renal transplant consult
was obtained, Per their recommendations, he was continued on his
Tacrolimus with levels checked q3 days - weekly, prednisone 5
mg/day, and his CellCept was held. His Cre  elevated to 1.4
after his episodes of hypotension, and were attributed to
secondary ATN. His
# Hypertension: Initially meds were held [**3-11**] low BPs. This
resolved w/ fluid boluses, and he was re-started on Metoprolol.
BPs were stable throughout hospital course.

# DM1: Patient was treated with Lantus 20 QHS and humalog
insulin sliding scale. Prior to discharge, pt was found to be
hypoglycemic (23) after receiving half dose of Lantus while
being NPO. Pt was given [**Location (un) 2452**] juice via PEG tube but started
having tonic clonic movements. He received 2 amps of D50 and 6mg
Ativan before seizure activity ended. Blood glucose came up to
mid 200s. Tube feeds were restarted slowly.

# CAD s/p CABG:  The patient has extensive cardiac disease, as
he is s/p NSTEMI and V-fib arrest in [**2169**] and CABG [**2170**]. No
evidence of ischemia on EKG. His trops/CKs came back negative,
and he was ruled out for MI.

# Mental status- MRI shows progression of multiple old infarcts.
Pt's MS [**First Name (Titles) 21299**] [**Last Name (Titles) 21300**] during ICU admission, and he began
to respond to vocal commands, communicate minimally with his
family, and track to voice. He was weaned off to Ativan. On
[**8-17**], he exhibited Cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name **] respirations, and was more
somnolent than usual. All VS were stable, and his saturations
stayed in the high 90%s. FS was 190, EKG was unchanged from
prior, and patient was not hypercarbic on ABG. Ativan and Reglan
were d/c-ed, and the patient gradually awakened over the course
of the day.

# Rash- Patient developed erythrematous, petechial, blanching in
nature on the chest and the upper extremities, most likely [**3-11**]
drugs (cephtriaxone and lasix are likely). Platelets, coags
stable. Rash is stable once his Lasix swithced to ethacrynic
acid for diuresis and allergy was recorded.

# Hypernatremia. Had Nas to high 140s during stay, likely
associated w/ insensible water losses and inability to PO while
being intubated. Continued free water boluses (200-300 ccs q4H
through OG tube and [**Hospital1 **] lyte checkes. ) Eventually resolved to
an sodium of 142 and remained stable during remainder of course.

# LE tremors- Neuro consult was o
