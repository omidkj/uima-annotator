Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2185-2-9**]:  Traction pin placement
[**2185-2-11**]:    ORIF Left distal femur fracture with removal of
traction pin.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a hx of asthma, paroxysmal AF who
is being transferred from the T-SICU/orthopedics to the medicine
floor s/p a mechanical fall with L femur fracture and aspiration
pneumonitis. Pt experienced a mechanical fall on [**2-9**] and broke
her left femur. Pt went to OR on [**2185-2-11**] and is currently 7 days
s/p L distal femoral ORIF. She had a pre-operative CXR on [**2-9**]
which showed a large midline hernia with stomach and transverse
colon within it, which appeared to have not been followed up.
She reportedly did well intially post-operatively on the
surgical floor, although was noted to have an increased oxygen
requirement to 3 L 2 days post-operatively and was noted to be
having difficulty tolerating POs post-operatively. Pt was being
followed by speech and swallow who stated on [**2185-2-14**] that the
patient had "atypical symptoms of aspiration" and recommended a
video swallow, which demonstrated UES dysfunction. Further GI
work-up was recommended, and GI was consulted on [**2185-2-15**], who
recommended a CT chest/abdomen and barium swallow. On [**2184-2-16**],
patient triggered for respiratory distress on floor and was
hypoxic to 53%, and transferred back to the ICU. This occurred
while she was being fed, but there were no witnessed aspiration
events. She had a CTA which was negative for PE, but confirmed
the presence of transverse colon herniating into the thorax.
During her MICU course, her O2 sats have been normal on oxygen.
She has a known hematoma in her L thigh.hematoma on left thigh
which [**Date Range **] is following. Overnight while in the ICU, she had a
slight decrease in hct overnight and was hypotensive in setting
of sleeping (low 80s). BPs improved with 500 ccs NS. Patient is
currently DNR/DNI with no escalation of care.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **]F h/o HTN, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dementia and
asthma presented fall and L femoral fracture s/p open reduction
internal fixation, complicated by acute hypoxic respiratory
distress and aspiration due to hiatal hernia, herniated
transverse colon into the thoracic cavity, and upper esophageal
sphincter stricture.

Brief Hospital Course by problem:

# L femur fracture:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2185-2-9**] via transfer from
[**Hospital 81684**] Hospital.  She was evaluated by the orthopaedic
service and found to have a left distal femur fracture.  A
traction pin was placed in the emergency department and she was
admitted, consented, and prepped for surgery.  The medical
service was consulted for help with preoperative clearance and
medical management.  She was taken to the operating room on
[**2185-2-11**].  She underwent an ORIF of his left distal femur
fracture with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 101**] plate.  She tolerated the procedure well,
was extubated,transferred to the recovery room, and then to the
floor.

# Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration pneumonitis as a result of
hiatal hernia and transverse colon in thorax. Patient was noted
to have difficulty tolerating POs 2 days after surgery with an
increased oxygen requirement. She triggered for hypoxia down to
the 50s requiring ICU re-admission, and recovered her
saturations with nasal oxygen. She was ruled out for an MI and
had a CTA showing no evidence of PE. No antibiotics were
administered given that her event was likely a chemical
pneumonitis from gastric reflux (no fevers or leukocytosis). She
was transferred back to the floor, kept on nasal canula oxygen,
standing albuterol nebulizers every 6 hours, and followed by
Speech and Swallow and GI while in house. She was initially kept
NPO after these aspiration events, but as her care became
focused on comfort, her diet was changed to dysphagia with mouth
care, swabs, ice, and comfort tastes.

# Dysphagia/Herniated bowel: Patient has a history of chronic
dysphagia w/ a history of achalasia and botox injections. She
has two contributing abnormalities: a  tight upper esophogeal
sphincter seen on video swallow (with associated stranding and
thickening on CT), and hiatal hernia/bowel into the thorax
through a diaphragmatic hernia noted on CXR and CT. GI and S&S
followed patient in house. UES dilation and EGD were offered to
patient and family to further work-up dysphagia. However,
patient and family declined procedure and focused on comfort
care only. She was continued on a PPI, bowel regimen, and
reglan/zofran as needed for nausea.

# HTN: Re-started beta-blocker with good hypertensive control.
D/c-ed hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril.

# PAF: Rate controlled on amiodarone and beta-blocker.  CHADS2
score = 1 (for age), so anticoagulation not required

# Femur fracture:  Pain control with IV dilaudid Q2H:PRN, which
was switched to oxycodone liquid and morphine liquid on
discharge.
.
# Dementia: frequent reorientation and minimize lines.
.
# Asthma: continued albuterol nebs

#Code: DNR/DNI (confirmed with HCP)
.
#Disposition: [**Hospital 1739**] hospice
