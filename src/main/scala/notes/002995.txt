HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 10269**] is a 79-year-old
woman who had intermittent claudication of both legs for many
years.  The claudication has continued to worsen to the point
where she has rest pain in her right foot.

Over the several weeks prior to surgery, she had a small
ulcer and developed a right fifth toe and heel ulcer of that
foot.  Her pain is worse at night, and she was referred to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for possible surgical intervention.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Her past medical history is
significant for)
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post angioplasty in [**2166**].
2.  She had a carotid endarterectomy in [**2164**].
3.  She had a left lower extremity bypass with a prosthetic
graft; she thinks a femoral to anterior tibial graft in [**2170**].
4.  She also had a thyroidectomy.
5.  Hysterectomy.
6.  Open reduction/internal fixation of a lift hip fracture.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Inderal, Cardizem, Capoten,
Coumadin, nitroglycerin patch, Beconase, [**Doctor First Name **], and Nexium.

ALLERGIES:  Allergy to PROCARDIA, PERCODAN, and KEFLEX.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not smoke currently.  The
patient is married and lives with her husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed a well-appearing elderly woman.  Heart rate was 54,
blood pressure was 130/72, respiratory rate was 14.  There
was a loud right cervical bruit.  The chest was clear.  The
heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was soft
and nontender.  No aneurysm or bruit palpated.  Her right
femoral pulse was nonpalpable.  A very faint palpable pulse
in the left groin.  All distal pulses were absent.  There was
a rubor of the right foot with elevational pallor.  There was
a 3-mm shallow ulcer on the plantar surface of the right heel
and an even smaller ulcer in the lateral aspect of her right
fifth toe.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient had an arteriogram done in
[**2179-12-5**] which showed extensive aortoiliac
atherosclerosis with critical stenosis in the right common
iliac and extensive high-grade stenosis throughout both
external iliac arteries.  The common femoral arteries were
somewhat diseased.  Both superficial femoral arteries were
occluded.  There were good-looking profundi bilaterally.
There was also significant stenosis in the origin of both
renal arteries and possibly an superior mesenteric artery
stenosis as well.


HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient had a magnetic resonance
angiography done that showed similar findings as the
angiogram with high-grade left renal artery stenosis,
moderate right renal artery stenosis, moderate-to-severe
proximal superior mesenteric artery stenosis, diffuse
atheromatous plaques in the abdominal aorta, suprarenal,
infrarenal aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta.  On
the right, severe proximal common iliac artery stenosis with
severe distal external iliac artery stenosis on the right.
An occluded superficial femoral artery on the right.  The
profunda femoris artery which supplies collaterals that
reconstitute above the knee, the popliteal artery on the
right.  On the left, there is moderate stenosis of the left
common iliac artery, and an occluded superficial femoral
artery graft.  The profundus femoris artery supplies
collaterals.  It also reconstitutes the popliteal artery on
that side.

The patient received cardiac clearance preoperatively, and
the surgical options were discussed.  It was decided to
perform and aortobifemoral profunda bypass graft.  The
patient agreed and was taken to the operating room on
[**2180-2-11**] with aortobifemoral profundus bypass graft
was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Estimated blood loss was
600 cc.  Urine output during the case was 450 cc.  The
patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and 5.6
liters of crystalloid.  The patient was taken to the
Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition with good
affect.

Postoperatively, the patient had warm extremities, with a
dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse on the right and a
dopplerable posterior tibialis pulse on the left with good
capillary refill.  Her hematocrit was 27.1 and magnesium was
1.2.  The patient was given one unit of blood.

Over the first night postoperatively, the patient had an
increasing volume requirement and an continued increasing
oxygen requirement.  Blood gas in the morning was
7.24/59/169/27 and -3 on 70% oxygen.  The patient also had
increasing complaints of pain overnight.  At that time, the
patient was also on a fenoldopam drip at 0.15 mcg/kg per
minute to 30.  At this time, the patient was on vancomycin
and Flagyl with no source of infection.  The patient was
afebrile at that time.

On the evening on postoperative day two, the patient had
increasing heart rates into the 100s with a narrow complex
tachycardia on electrocardiogram.  At this time, the patient
end-diastolic pressure was around 15, pulmonary artery
pressures in the middle 40s, saturating 98% on 3 liters face
mask.

Cardiology was consulted for the tachycardia.  The diltiazem
drip was continued with rates in the middle 80s.  The
tachycardia likely secondary to congestive heart failure.
With a rising white blood cell count, ischemia needed to be
ruled out, and the General Surgery team was consulted, and a
sigmoidoscopy was performed which just showed diverticulosis
of the sigmoid colon with normal mucosa up to 30 cm with no
evidence of ischemia to this 30-cm point.

On postoperative day four, the patient was continued on the
diltiazem drip and Lasix for diuresis with a total of four
liters out over the past 24 hours.  The patient was also
continued on beta blockade as well as vancomycin.  For pain
control, the epidural catheter was discontinued and a
Dilaudid patient-controlled analgesia was being used with
good affect.

On postoperative day five, the tachycardia had improved, with
pulses in the 80s with a diltiazem drop and Lopressor.

On postoperative day six, the patient's diet was advanced to
clear liquids.  The patient was also on oral diltiazem and
intravenous Lopressor with good rate control in the 70s.  The
patient was also in good pain control with a Dilaudid
patient-controlled analgesia.  The patient continued to have
intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation.  A few of these
episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but returned to
sinus rhythm in a short time with no specific treatment.

The rest of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was fairly
uneventful, but with a white blood cell count currently at
11.  The patient had an ultrasound of the right upper
quadrant which showed an enlarged gallbladder with edema with
a normal common bile duct and the suggestion of a dilated
intrahepatic duct.  The patient did have a [**Doctor Last Name **] sign, and
General Surgery was asked to evaluate the patient for
cholecystitis.

The patient's symptoms actually significantly improved.  Her
abdominal pain completely dissipated.  Her liver function
tests revealed AST was 16, ALT was 24, alkaline phosphatase
was 200, total bilirubin was 0.6, direct bilirubin was 0.5,
amylase was 31, and lipase was 56.

The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13797**].  At that time, no
intervention was deemed necessary considering her remarkable
clinical improvement.  A HIDA scan had been done on the same
day as the ultrasound and was consistent with acute
cholecystitis; however, the patient continued to improve with
antibiotics.  The General Surgery consultation physician (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 13797**] felt conservative management at this time was
appropriate.  No further episodes of abdominal pain.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION/CONDITION:  The patient was in stable
condition and in sinus rhythm.  The incisions were intact.
The incision of the left groin continued to drain some
serous fluid.  There was no erythema, and no evidence of
infection.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: (She was discharged on the
following medications)
 1.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.o.d. and 2.5 mg p.o. q.o.d.
 2.  Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. (for a 10-day course).
 3.  Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. (for a 10-
