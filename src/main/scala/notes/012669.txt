STUDIES:

[**2187-5-4**] CXR:
CHEST, AP UPRIGHT:  Lungs are clear.  Changes of median
sternotomy, with
mediastinal clips and coronary artery bypass grafting.  Heart
size is top
normal.  Aorta is tortuous and calcified.  There are no
significant pleural
effusions, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2187-5-5**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and
infero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2187-5-5**] RENAL U.S.
Right kidney surgically absent. No evidence of left
hydronephrosis.
