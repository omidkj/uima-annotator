Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Bronchoscopy
Rigid bronchoscopy
Bronchial artery embolization

History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 year old female with PMH history significant for TB
treated 20 years prior, bronchiectasis on 2L home oxygen, ASD
s/p surgical repair with resultant atrial fibrillation, history
of subdural hematoma and rectus sheath hematoma secondary to
coumadin and multiple TIAs off of anticoagulation, on dabigatran
for several weeks who presented initially to OSH for hemoptysis
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Per report, patient with several coughing episodes last night
with hemoptysis of several teaspoons of bright red blood.  She
went to bed without incident.  On the day of admission, patient
developed massive amounts of hemoptysis (several cupfulls) at
1PM today, and was taken to an OSH.  There, she was found to be
tachycardic to the 120s and hypoxic to 85% (on unclear amount of
oxygen) with stable hematocrit of 42.7 and an INR of 1.1.  Other
labs notable for wbc of 15.3, dig level of 0.7, trop of 0.01,
CK: 51, sodium 126.  She was intubated for airway protection.
Chest radiograph without acute process.  Thoracic surgery team
performed bronchoscopy who found blood in the RLL; no
intervention was performed.  NG tube was placed and drained
coffee ground material.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were 130/80, 80, 16, 100%.
Repeat hct was 39.5 and INR was 1.3.  NG lavage was clear.
Chest radiograph demonstrated opacities bilaterally concerning
for blood vs. aspiration.  IP was consulted and patient was
taken emergently to OR for rigid bronchoscopy, which
demonstrated large clot in RLL with active oozing around the
clot.  BAL was performed.  Left lung was suctioned of blood.
Double lumen endotracheal tube was placed to protect the left
lung.  Plan was for IR to evaluate patient for bronchial artery
embolization.

Past Medical History:
- atrial fibrillation, previously on coumadin but now on
dabigatran
- history of subdural bleed 3 years ago while on coumadin with
some dysarthria and right sided weakness
- history of multiple TIAs (most recently 2 weeks ago) while off
coumadin (restarted coumadin several years ago) -> stopped
definitively on 10/[**2110**].  Restarted dabigatran several weeks
ago.
- history of large rectus sheath hematoma in [**8-/2111**]
- HTN
- GERD
- history of TB treated 20 years ago
- bronchiectasis with home oxygen of 2L
- ASD s/p surgical repair 10 years prior with development of
atrial fibrillation after procedure
- chronic hyponatremia ? secondary to SIADH

Social History:
Lives with family in [**Location (un) **].  Prior 15 pack year smoking
history.  No alcohol or other illicit drug use.

Imaging:
Chest radiograph ([**2111-12-11**]):
1. ET tube 6 cm above carina.
2. Endogastric tube side port just at the GE junction, would
recommend
advancing approximately 5 more cm to ensure that it is within
the stomach.
3. Patchy opacities throughout the lungs may represent
aspiration or
hemorrhage in this patient with hemoptysis.
4. Prominent right apical opacity may be prominent assymetic
pleural
thickening. Recommend correlation with history of malignancy and
chest CT for further evaluation.
.
Bronch report ([**2111-12-11**]): large clot in RLL, actively oozing
around clot.  Clot was not disturbed.
.
TTE ([**2111-12-12**]):
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Free wall
motion is low normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderaet mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.
.
Rigid bronch report ([**2111-12-12**]):
Once the patient was relaxed, the rigid bronchoscope was
introduced into the oral cavity and followed along the double
lumen endotracheal tube u
