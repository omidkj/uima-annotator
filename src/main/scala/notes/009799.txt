Admission Date:  [**2101-6-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-6-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2024-8-2**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Blue Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male who presented to the emergency room with worsening
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting x 4.

The patient had recently been undergoing an evaluation for
painless jaundice.  In early [**Month (only) 116**] the patient had an abdominal
CT at an outside hospital which demonstrated intrahepatic
ductal dilatation.  On [**2101-6-10**] the patient came to [**Hospital1 1444**] and underwent an ERCP by the
GI team which demonstrated a pancreatic duct stricture, which
was compatible with a mass, a biliary stricture, and a stent
placement in the biliary system.  The patient tolerated this
procedure well and during the admission when told that the
most likely [**Hospital1 **] was cancer, signed out against medical
advice.

At home over the next several days the family reported the
patient developed worsening abdominal pain accompanied with
nausea and vomiting.  When this continued to worsen the
family brought the patient to the emergency room for further
evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Hypertension.  2.
Hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was
tachycardic with a blood pressure of 110/41.  He was alert
but agitated.  The chest was clear.  Heart was regular but
tachycardic.  He had diffuse abdominal tenderness with
guarding and rebound.  The rectal examination was normal and
guaiac negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 13, hematocrit 46, INR 2.1, BUN
80, creatinine 4.9, bicarbonate 11, ALT 84, AST 91, alkaline
phosphatase 545, bilirubin 10.

Chest x-ray demonstrated the possibility of free air
overlying the epigastrium.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the presentation of an acute abdomen
following an ERCP and the possibility of free air the patient
was emergently taken to the operating room where he underwent
an exploratory laparotomy.  A duodenal perforation was
discovered and repaired with oversewing and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] patch.
At that time also a jejunostomy tube was placed.  The biliary
stent was removed and a T tube was placed as well.  A liver
biopsy was taken as well.  The patient remained tenuous
during the perioperative period.  In the operating room he
received two units of packed cells, three units of fresh
frozen plasma, 3,000 of crystalloid.  He did continue to make
urine and was postoperatively taken to the surgical intensive
care unit for close hemodynamic monitoring.

During the early postoperative course the patient's
hemodynamics were maintained with Neo-Synephrine pressor
support.  The patient demonstrated improvement over the
ensuing days and the pressor support was weaned.  The
hematocrit remained stable.  The patient's renal function
improved with a significant drop in the creatinine.  As the
patient improved, the respiratory support was weaned as well
as tolerated.

During this time with the sedation weaned the patient would
follow commands and appeared to be neurologically intact.  By
postoperative day three the patient was extubated.  The
jejunostomy tube feeds were started and advanced to goal.
The patient was maintained on broad-spectrum antibiotics.  On
postoperative day number six the patient was transferred to
the floor.  On the floor the patient had a temperature spike
which prompted a work-up and a CAT scan was performed.  The
patient demonstrated multilocular retroperitoneal fluid
collection.  He underwent a CT-guided drainage and the
cultures demonstrated [**Female First Name (un) 564**] from this collection.  The
patient was started on AmBisome IV.  Infectious disease was
consulted and the patient was maintained on the
broad-spectrum antibiotics as before as well.  The patient
defervesced and a follow-up CAT scan done prior to discharge
demonstrates that the fluid collections have decreased in
size.  The patient will be discharged with drains in place.

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy, has been
ambulating with no assistance and will not require intensive
rehabilitation.

The patient's tube feeds have been cycled at night and the
patient has been allowed to advance to a house diet which he
has tolerated.

The patient prior to discharge underwent a T-tube
cholangiography to examine the placement of the T-tube and
the anatomy of the biliary tree.  This was normal with good
contrast entering the duodenum and the T-tube was capped
prior to discharge, which he has tolerated.  The patient's
family had multiple meetings with his doctors regarding the
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] of presumed cancer.  The patient's family and the
patient understand that without definitive tissue [**Name5 (PTitle) **],
the prognosis is unclear.  The patient also does not want any
further invasive therapy at this time.  The family would
rather have the patient be discharged to home, recover from
his current illness, and reassess the situation at a later
time during a follow-up visit.  Arrangements are being made
for a visiting nurse.

The patient will be discharged home with VNA and cycled tube
feedings at night.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Biliary stricture which is presumably a carcinoma but with
no definitive tissue [**Name5 (PTitle) **].
2. Duodenal perforation and repair.
3. Malnutrition.
4. Abdominal fungal abscess.
5. Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. to be continued for one week
after drains have been removed.
2. Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. to be continued for one week
after drains have been removed.
3. Fluconazole 400 mg p.o. q.d. to be continued until the
drains have been removed.
4. Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q. 6 hours p.r.n.
7. Dilaudid 2 mg p.o. q. 4 hours p.r.n.
8. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. The patient will continue on medications as before.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Wet-to-dry dressing changes to the abdominal wound b.i.d.
2. Drainage catheters #1 and #2 to gravity with daily volume
recording.
3. Tube feedings from 7 PM to 7 AM which would be ProMod with
fiber 70 mL per hour.
4. Two cans of Boost per day.
5. Diet as tolerated.
6. Jejunostomy tube should remain clamped during the day.
7. T-tube should be capped and remain underneath the
dressing.
8. No showers, but sponge baths as tolerated.
9. Activity as tolerated.
10. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as directed.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in
