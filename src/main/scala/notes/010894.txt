Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted from rehabilitation for
hypotension (systolic blood pressure to the 70s) and
decreased urine output.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male who had been hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 190**] from [**10-11**] through [**10-19**] of [**2101**]
after undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was
subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

On [**2101-10-20**], he presented again to the [**Hospital1 346**] after being found to have a systolic
blood pressure in the 70s and no urine output for 17 hours.
A Foley catheter placed at the rehabilitation facility
yielded 100 cc of murky/brown urine.  There may also have
been purulent discharge at the penile meatus at this time.

On presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient was
without subjective complaints.  In the Emergency Department,
he was found to have systolic blood pressure of 85.  He was
given 6 liters of intravenous fluids and transiently started
on dopamine for a systolic blood pressure in the 80.s

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired and had been living
at home with his wife prior to his admission to the hospital
on [**2101-10-11**]; he had been living at [**Hospital3 1761**] for the day prior to admission.  He is a
social drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;
although, he quit smoking 20 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical
examination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,
heart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following
administration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory
was 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There
were normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were
hypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft
pulse, [**Hospital3 17394**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,
and intact.  Please note that the above examination was done
by the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was
initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial
laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell
count of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets
were 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR
was 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,
potassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood
urea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose
was 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and
phosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were
pending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on
admission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out
yeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also
initially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated
stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no
focal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of
the chest compared with a [**2101-10-15**] study.  No
radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or
pneumonia.

His admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,
nonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages
in the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when
compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2101-10-12**].

An initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination
that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No
evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,
incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple
left renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and
partially calcified prostate gland.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to
the Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased
urine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary
to a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were
never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).

While boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the
night of admission, the patient had a sudden
cardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with
epinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion
times four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.

Following these measures, the patient returned to a sinus
rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;
the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to
the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He
subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood
pressure.

An echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a
trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a
hyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided
filling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this
arrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were
elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.

A repeat echocardiogram done on [**2101-10-21**]
demonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction
of 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities
including inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular
akinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and
moderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study
of [**2101-10-20**]; the left ventricular function was
unchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the
right ventricular function appeared worse.

On [**2101-10-21**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone
and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The
following day, he was started on heparin intravenously given
his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this
medication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated
tr
