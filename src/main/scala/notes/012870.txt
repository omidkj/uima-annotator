Service: MED

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory difficulty due to tumor impingment on L main
bronchus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and debridement of tumor impinging on L bronchus.


History of Present Illness:
74yo F with non-small cell Lung CA diagnosed in [**2097**] (stage 3b),
presented for bronchoscopy, photodynamic therapy, and
debridement of L bronchus on [**8-29**] by interventional pulmonary
service. The procedure cleared the LLL & LUL but the lingula
remained obstructed at the end of the procedure.  In the PACU,
the pt became tachpneic with decreased breath sounds on left,
increased airway pressures, peak=32 with plateau=27. CXR
demonstrated complete opacification of the L lung without
midline shift.  She was subsequently bronched in the PACU with
suctioning of a mucous plug from the L bronchus - showed
improvement in pt's breath sounds on L, peak pressure now 24,
CXR with improved ventilation of L lung. She was then
transferred to the MICU for further evaluation and treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)Pulmonary - Oxygen sat's, respiratory rate, and peak pressures
were monitored closely for indication of recurrent obstruction.
Repeat bronch by IP [**9-1**] showed edematous airways.  It was felt
to be difficult to extubate the patient given edematous airways
and aggressive diuresis was begun. On [**9-3**] the RISBI was 73 and
the patient strongly desired the tube out; the patient was
extubated on [**2103-9-3**]. After extubation, she began to experience
respiratory difficulty and required support. She was clear in
her wishes to not be reintubated, and was begun on bipap and
then on cpap overnight. Morphine was administered to ease her
breathing.

2)A-fib/AVR - Coumadin was held until after procedures. IV
heparin was restarted [**9-1**], and coumadin was restarted [**2103-9-3**].

3)DM - The patient was covered with sliding scale insulin. The
plan was to resume OP meds when extubated & taking PO meals. She
did not take PO meals while hospitalized.

4)FEN - The patient was kept NPO. She was offered an NGT to
begin tube feeds, but given her daily reevaluation for
extubation, she preferred not to begin tube feeds. She received
maintainence fluids while not taking PO's.
She was noted to have an increasing anion gap acidosis, perhaps
due to starvation ketosis.

5)Oliguria after second bronch in PACU. Received fluid boluses
but did not respond with increased urine output. On [**9-2**]
oliguria improved, questionably due to position of Foley
catheter. She put out approximately 500cc with each dose of 20
IV lasix.

6)ID - Low grade temp on [**2103-9-3**]. Urine, blood, sputum cultures
still pending but no growth to date at time of discharge.

7)Prophylaxis - Protonix, SQ Heparin, pneumoboots, SS Insulin,
Chlorhexidine.

8)Access - 2 peripheral IV's, Foley catheter.

9)Communication - Husband & daughters

10)Status - DNR/DNI.
