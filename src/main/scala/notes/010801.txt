Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8684**]
Chief Complaint:
right hip pain and erythema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement
Bronchoscopy
Relocation of hip prosthesis with hip washout


History of Present Illness:
78 yo female who was recently admitted on [**3-18**] for Hemi
arthroplasty, right femoral neck fracture and  pen reduction and
internal fixation, greater trochanter. She had sustained a
mechanical fall after a slip on the ice. This resulting in a
right femoral neck fracture and trochanteric fracture, no other
injuries indentified.

Patient represents from rehab where she had low grade
temperatures, noted to have increased erythema, induration, and
drainage from her incision. She was also started on [**3-23**] on
levoquin for a pna and also was switched from Lovenox to
coumadin. Patient presented with incision pain, but denies any
CP, or SOB. Denies any dysuria or change in bowel movements.
Patient was febrile to 101.4.
Pt was brought to medicine floor and with a plan to treat with
vanco/zosyn.  As her Hct had fallen and her INR was at 3.1, FFP
was given to reverse her coagualopapthy.  Pt became tachycardic
to 140's and then hypotense on the floor. The patient was
transferred to the ICU where a central line was placed and
aggressive fluid and PRBC resuscitation occurred.  Pt's code
status was confirmed as DNR/DNI.
An MRI of right leg was done to assess wound and no definite
collection observed.
Pt currently has oozing from site where hematoma was opened on
[**4-4**]. The ortho team is considering I&D today or tomorrow

Pertinent Results:
EKG: tachy 118, lateral EKG changes with T wave inversion in
V5-v6 and ST segment depression in V4

chest x-ray: New left upper lobe atelectasis, which could be due
to mucous plugging,
infection or endobronchial tumor.  Interval resolution of the
left

compared to the prior exam.

RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

MR HIP W/O CONRAST  [**2172-4-5**] 12:42 AM

MR HIP W/O CONRAST

Reason: infection

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with s/p ORIF
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
infection
INDICATION: Hip pain status post open reduction internal
fixation.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar MRI of the hips including T1W and
inversion recovery imaging sequences.

FINDINGS: The right femoral and acetabular prosthesis are
dislocated from the right acetabulum and displaced superiorly.
The patient is also status post left hip replacement with
associated susceptibility artifact. Within the right acetabulum,
there is fluid and possibly a heme-fluid level. There is a
hematoma within the right lateral thigh which measures 15 x 3 x
4 cm. There is a right hamstring avulsion fracture, partially
imaged in this study. There is extensive subcutaneous edema,
with relative sparing of the left buttock. There is edema within
the right adductor muscles. There is also a moderate amount of
ascites within the pelvis.

A 2 cm right renal cyst is partially imaged on this study.

IMPRESSIONS:

1) Dislocation of the right hip prosthesis, with a possible heme
arthrosis and hematoma within the right lateral thigh.

2) Avulsion fracture of the right hamstrings, partially imaged
in this study.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (tape
not available)
of [**2169-6-9**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function
(LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Focal apical
hypokinesis of RV free
wall.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild to
moderate ([**2-2**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate
[[**2-2**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. No
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2164**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations,
the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and
echocardiographic data. Left pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal
with focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary a
