Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 66 year old male with multiple medical problems
including diabetes, COPD on oxygen at baseline, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia who presented to the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes clinic this
afternoon complaining of increased fatigue, shortness of breath
and cough for the past three weeks.  He also has been
experiencing lightheadedness and blurry vision intermittently.
The patient also experienced an episode of hypoglycemia this
morning (finger stick of 25) which he treated with [**Location (un) 2452**] juice
and glucose with rapid resolution.  Given his symptoms this AM
in diabetes clinic, he was advised to present to the ED.
.
He denies chest pain and worsening cough.  He does report
increased shortness of breath but has not needed to increase his
home oxygen use.  He denies fevers, chills.  He has a cough at
baseline which is non-productive and non-purulent and may be
slightly more productive over the past few weeks. He has lost 15
lbs over three months when his lasix dose was increased.  He
denies any recent medication changes, or dietary changes.  He
denies hemoptysis.  He denies any recent periods of immobility,
long distance travel.  No recent sick contacts.
.
In the ED the patient was found to be afebrile, hypoxic with an
O2 sat of 84% on 100% O2, and hypotensive with a BP of 83/60 and
HR 92.  His hypotension resolved with IV fluids.  An EKG was
performed which revealed a right bundle branch block and there
was concern for anterioseptal ST-depression.  Cardiology was
consulted who did not feel that he was experience an acute
coronary event.  He did recieve aspirin 325, and was started on
a heparin and nitroglycerine gtt.  First set of troponins came
back negative.  Initial chem7 revelaed a serum potassium of 6.4
on an non-hemolyzed specimen and he received insulin, sodium
bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, dextrose and kaexylate.

wall motion is  normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3.The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic  function appears depressed. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position  consistent with right
ventricular volume overload.

negative by Fellow and echo technician present.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 66 year old male with multiple medical problems
including diabetes, COPD on oxygen at baseline, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia who presented to the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes clinic
complaining of increased fatigue, shortness of breath and cough
for the past three weeks.  Pt was admitted to the MICU for
management of respiratory distress with hypercarbic hypoxia.
The following issues were addressed during this admission:
.
# Hypoxemia: We originally considered cardiac versus primary
respiratory etiologies for his hypoxia.  There was no evidence
of ischemia per routine cycling of cardiac markers.
Additionally, clinical exam, TTE, and CXR failed to reveal
significant evidence of CHF, and CT-PA was negative for PE.
Physical exam and CXR findings appeared most consistent with an
exacerbation of COPD, possibly compounded by underlying cardiac
disease.  Accordingly, pt began a one week course of
azithromycin, started high dose IV steroids, combivent nebs,
home-dose flovent/advair/spiriva, and was placed on BiPAP for
improved ventilation/oxygenation.  Pt showed rapid improvement
in his respiratory status.  As pt continued to improve, his
steroids were transitioned from IV to po with subsequent taper,
and mask ventilation was transitioned to nasal cannula w/o
issue.  At discharge, pt had returned to his clinical baseline,
with mildly increased O2 requirement vs. baseline (currently
SpO2 >88% on 6 L NC).  Pt was discharged on prednisone taper,
azithromycin, home resp meds, with recommendation for close
PCP/pulmonology f/u.  Pt noted that he understood and agreed
with this plan.
.
# Diabetes: [**Last Name (un) **] continued to follow during admission,
adjusting insulin dosing as needed in the face of inflammation
and steroid use.  Pt will continue to f/u with [**Last Name (un) **] as an
outpatient as he tapers off of the prednisone.
.
# Hypertension: BP was well-controlled on home meds (Toprol XL
50 mg, Norvasc 5 mg, Lisinopril 20 mg); lasix, diovan, and
spironolactone w
