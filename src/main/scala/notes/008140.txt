Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for plasma pharesis evaluation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Knee washout, intubation

History of Present Illness:
62-year-old male with history of multiple myeloma/plasma cell
dyscrasia, type I cryoglobulinemia, chronic renal insufficiency,
congestive heart failure, anemia and COPD presents from OSH with
staphylcoccus aureus bacteremia, acute on chronic renal
insufficiency, lower extremity edema for evaluation of plasma
pharesis.
.
Per OSH records, the patient was in his usual state of health
until recently when he received velcade and ecadron on [**1-30**] and
again on [**2-6**] and was admitted for concern of tumor lysis
syndrome. He improved and was discharged home. However, at home
he continued be be very weak and developed progressive lower
extremity edema. He missed his nephrology appointments although
was able to keep an oncology appointment on [**2-10**]. At that time
he was admitted for bilateral leg edema.
.
On admission, he was afebrile, denied dysuria, polyuria,
shortness of breath, cough, or other symptoms other than chronic
pain and fatigue. His labs were significant for a WBC 17.4, Hct
34.0, Plt 108, BUN 86, Cr 4.24 (was 3.25 five days prior), uric
acid 11.6, LDH 230. Nephrology was consulted and thought that
the patient had bilateral edema from acute on chronic renal
failure, likely secondary to cryoglobulinemia. He was given
lasix and steroids. Over the next two days he had improvement of
BUN to 76, creatinine to 2.33 (eventual nadir 2.17) and
worsening of thrombocytopenia (to 27). He developed
hallucinations and had a head CT that was negative. He developed
a bandemia of 15. He was pan cultured and diagnosed with a
urinary tract infection. CXR without evidence of acute
infection. He was started on levofloxacin. He continue to have
altered mental status and deveoped hypotension to 99/63, fevers
to 101F and rising WBC. Blood cultures revealed 4/4 bottles with
staphylcoccus aureus (sensitivities pending) and he was started
on vancomycin. ID was consulted and recommended IV antibiotics
for 4-6 weeks and a TTE. Levofloxacin was discontinued. He
became progressively altered and was transferred to the ICU for
further evaluation and management.
.
In the ICU, head CT was done and was negative. ABG was
7.57/32.9/89. He was noted to have hypoalbuminemia and relative
hypotension. [**Name2 (NI) **] was started on PPN, albumin and given 1 u pRBC.
The day of transfer labs were WBC 5.4, Hct 22.3, Plt 12, BUN
102, Cr 2.22, albumin 1.3. Vitals at time of transfer were T
97.8, BP 108/59 (per report baseline 140s), HR 110, RR 28, SaO2
92% 4L NC. Per signout, although no mention in notes,
nephrologist states that he need dialysis. The reason for
transfer is for evaluation for plasma pharesis.  He was given
1uPRBCs prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was intermittently responsive to
questions, reports all-over body pain and otherwise difficult to
ascertain as patient not very responsive other than moaning to
movement.  He was intubated essentially on arrival for CXR
showing ARDS and poor O2 saturation on 6L NC and facemask.  30
mins s/p intubation patient then dropped his BP to 50's, was
given IVF bolus, CVL was placed in R femoral artery emergently
and patient was given peripheral dopa, then levophed through the
central line, and 0.1mg of epinephrine.  His BP went up to 70's,
then steadily increased to 160's, and pressors were weaned down.
 His art stick showed acidemia and a lactate that increased from
2.6 to 8.2.
