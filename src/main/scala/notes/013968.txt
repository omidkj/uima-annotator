CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hematemesis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 94633**] is a Russian-speaking
gentleman with a long past medical history including coronary
artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2181**], myocardial infarction in [**2173**], congestive heart failure
with an ejection fraction of 40% and 3+ mitral regurgitation,
status post dual-mode, dual-pacing, dual-sensing pacer
placement for sick sinus syndrome, history of atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic renal
insufficiency (at baseline creatinine between 1.6 and 2.1),
interstitial lung disease, osteoarthritis, and
insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes who presents to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department with
bloody diarrhea and hematemesis.  History is taken from his
wife who is the translator and the Emergency Department
charts.

One day prior to admission the patient had nausea, vomiting,
and bloody diarrhea with bright red blood per rectum and a
large volume of hematemesis times two.  He felt lightheaded
and short of breath when going to the bathroom.  He never had
gastrointestinal bleeding in the past.  The patient denies
chest pain, lower extremity edema, cough, fever, or chills.
He called his primary care physician who advised him to go to
the Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department he had continued epigastric pain
and received nasogastric lavage with 1 liter without
clearing.  He was seen by Gastrointestinal who deferred
endoscopy for an INR of 4.  The patient was given blood
transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K in the
Emergency Department.  He was subsequently assessed by the
Medical Intensive Care Unit team and admitted to the unit.

sitting up 109, blood pressure 109/75, respirations 20,
oxygen saturation 99% on room air.  In general, an elderly

Right sclerae with erythema.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Oropharynx without lesions.  Neck was supple, neck veins
flat.  No lymphadenopathy.  Chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular was regular.  No murmurs, rubs
or gallops appreciated.  Abdomen had normal active bowel
sounds, obese, soft nontender, nondistended, guaiac-positive.
Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White count 12.9,
hematocrit 34.6, platelets 350.  PT 24.1, INR 4, PTT 37.5.
Sodium 139, potassium 5.6, chloride 105, bicarbonate 19,
blood urea nitrogen 45, creatinine 1.7, glucose 352.
Creatine kinase 100, MB 4, troponin of less than 0.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram with sinus rhythm
at 88 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, Q wave in
II, III, and aVF, ST segment depressions in V2 through V5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 94633**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further treatment of his acute bleeding.  He was intubated
for impending esophagogastroduodenoscopy and hemodynamic
instability which included tachycardia and increased blood
pressure.  The patient received 5 units of packed red blood
cells, 5 units of fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K, along
with intravenous fluids.  The patient's INR went from 4
to 1.3.

Subsequently esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which
revealed diffuse nodularity, a clot in the fundus, and some
small polys, and erosions, but there was no active source of
bleeding.  No biopsies were done at that time.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Cardiology was asked to evaluate the
patient, and they recommended short-acting beta blocker to
maintain systolic blood pressure below 200 and heart rate
below the 150s.  The patient was started on an esmolol drip
withe good affect.  However, during the hospitalization, the
patient's cardiac enzymes revealed an elevated troponin which
initially was less than 0.3 and rising to 2.8 on [**2187-12-13**] and decreasing to 0.5 by [**2187-12-20**].  This was
thought to be demand ischemia.  Given the patient's acute
problems, his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended a stress
test as an outpatient at a later date when other issues have
stabilized.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation well
controlled on procainamide and anticoagulation with Coumadin.
Given his acute gastrointestinal bleed Cardiology recommended
discontinuation of Coumadin, and because the patient has been
in sinus rhythm for over seven years it was thought that the
patient can also stop procainamide.  However, the patient
went into atrial fibrillation on [**12-17**] and was quickly
cardioverted chemically with intravenous procainamide.

Because of the patient's chronic renal insufficiency he was
started on maintenance amiodarone.  Initially, the patient
received 400 mg of amiodarone t.i.d. for one week, and
currently is taking 400 mg of amiodarone q.d. for three
months, and thereafter he will take 200 mg p.o. q.d.  The
patient has been in stable normal sinus rhythm since
cardioversion on [**12-18**].

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit with a brisk upper
gastrointestinal bleed and was transfusion, in total, 9 units
of blood and 5 units of fresh frozen plasma.  The patient's
INR was rapidly corrected and endoscopy was emergently done.
It showed no evidence of active bleeding but there was
diffuse and continuous erythema, congestion, nodularity, and
mosaic of the mucosa of the stomach without bleeding
especially at the antrum, stomach body, and pylorus.  There
was blood in the whole stomach and erosions at the antrum.
However, there was no active bleeding noted.  The patient was
started on Protonix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.

Over the course of the hospitalization the patient's
hematocrit remained stable above 30, and his stools became
guaiac-negative toward the end of the hospitalization.
Furthermore, the patient was found to be Helicobacter pylori
positive during this admission, and he was begun on triple
therapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori which
included clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and Prevacid.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was aggressively transfused to
maintain a hematocrit of 30, and over the course of the
hospital developed worsening congestive heart failure which
was treated with Lasix successfully.  He was extubated on
[**12-17**]
