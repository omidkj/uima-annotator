The patient is a 61 year old female who has a significant
history for coronary artery disease.  She had a coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2188-5-20**], which was complicated by
graft failures requiring coronary artery bypass graft.  She
also had repeat catheterization and coronary artery stenting
complicated by ventricular fibrillation.  She had an
automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator placed at that
time.  She had a prolonged Intensive Care Unit stay and had
placement of a tracheostomy and a percutaneous gastrostomy
tube.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Living related renal transplant in
[**2186-2-19**].

Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Prior to this admission, the patient has had several long
hospital courses.  The first was in [**2188-8-20**], and the
second as stated was in [**2188-9-20**], into [**2188-11-20**].
Her hospitalization required ventilatory support and the
patient had been treated for pneumonia.  On her last hospital
stay [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 404**] as stated, the patient
developed acute on chronic renal failure.  She had a
tracheostomy and was slowly weaned for ventilation failure
and was treated for line infections.  The patient was
eventually transferred to rehabilitation for further care.
The patient, however, represented to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2188-12-24**], with complaints of abdominal
pain.

Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2188-5-20**], complicated by thrombosis of her bypass
grafts and ventricular fibrillation . The patient had an
automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator placed.  The
patient had a prolonged ventilatory wean and was tracheostomy
dependent and had a gastrostomy tube placed.  The patient has
a history of type I diabetes mellitus.  The patient developed
acute renal failure, status post her ventricular fibrillation
arrest and has current end stage renal disease and is on
hemodialysis.  The patient had a living related renal
transplant in [**2185**], with graft failure in [**2188-10-20**],
again during the ventricular arrest.

The patient is status post cerebrovascular accident and has a
depressed ejection fraction.

The patient has a history of methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and aseptic
thrombophlebitis.

The patient has a history of chronic colonization of
pseudomonas in her sputum.

The patient has a history of tracheostomy and a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

The patient has a history of being Heparin antibody positive
and a history of zoster.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old
female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery
disease, end stage renal disease, who was recently discharged
on [**2188-11-25**], to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.  She was doing well
until five days prior to admission when she began having left
lower quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain.  She
stated that the pain was constant for five days but slowly
increased.  The patient denied other symptomatology.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was afebrile
with a temperature of 97.0, blood pressure 181/63.  On
physical examination, she was an ill appearing female who was
uncomfortable.  Her neck had trach capped, the site was
clean.  Chest had crackles at the bases.  The abdomen was
soft, but distended.  She was quiet.  She had mild epigastric
tenderness with left lower quadrant tenderness without any
frank rebound or guarding.  There was some purulent discharge
from her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site.  She had
pitting edema in her extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her laboratory examination was significant
for a white blood cell count of 9.4, creatinine of 1.8,
albumin 2.9.  KUB was performed which demonstrated no
obstruction and that she was full of stool.

IMPRESSION:  The initial impression was that this was a 61
year old female with long medical history as stated who had
abdominal pain which was quite concerning.  The plan was to
keep her NPO and continue decompression and obtain an
abdominal CT scan.  The patient was initially seen and
admitted to the medical night float service and they decided
to get a surgical consultation.  Surgical consultation was
obtained.  She again was tender in the left lower quadrant.
She had no guarding and she had no rebound.  She had some
voluntary guarding.  On rectal examination, she had stool in
her vault.  She was guaiac negative.  She was a diabetic
female who remained on high dose steroids.  She was
discharged to rehabilitation on 60 mg of steroids, who
presented with abdominal pain and tenderness on examination.
The patient had nasogastric tube placed.  CAT scan was
obtained.  CAT scan showed free abdominal air.  The patient
was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy.
At this point, it was found that the gastrostomy tube had
eroded through her stomach and was freely floating in her
abdominal cavity.  She had a gastrotomy that was spilling
into her contents.  During the operation the gallbladder was
necrotic and we performed open cholecystectomy, performed a
biopsy of the liver and repaired the stomach where the old
gastrostomy tube site was in place in a two layer closure.
The skin incision over the gastrostomy tube was left open.
The patient remained intubated and was taken to the Intensive
Care Unit for postoperative care.

The patient's postoperative course was a stormy course over
the next two weeks.  The patient developed progressive
multisystem organ failure despite the institution of CVPHD to
manage her dialysis needs as well as her fluid status.  We
rapidly tapered her steroids from 60 down to a lower dose for
immunosuppressive medication.  She developed paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation and she was placed on Amiodarone.  She
developed large pleural effusions which were tapped and she
had a chest tube placed to drain large pleural effusions.
She developed progressive hypotension requiring multiple
pressors and she required progressive and increasing amounts
of ventilatory support including high dose FIO2.  Throughout
her hospital course, we had constant communication with the
family to discuss her care and her plans.  She also developed
recurrent herpes infection which she had previously.
However, despite our maximum care including multiple
pressors, CVPHD, multiple broad spectrum intravenous
antibiotics and despite pulmonary consultations and
infectious disease consultation, the patient did not make any
progress and progressed with multisystem organ dysfunction
and multisystem organ failure despite being on Vancomycin,
Imipenem, Acyclovir, having multiple line tips cultured and
being pancultured.  The patient had a repeat CT scan that did
not demonstrate any focal abdominal collections or any
abscesses.  Despite our maximum care, on [**2189-1-8**], we had
discussion with the family about making the patient DNR.  On
[**2189-1-9**], she was made comfort measures only.  Her pressors
were discontinued and she subsequently expired thirty minutes
later.  Time of death was pronounced at 1559 on [**2189-1-9**].
