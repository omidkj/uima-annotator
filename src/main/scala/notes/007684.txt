Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
Cholangitis, Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with stent placement
Laproscopic Cholecystectomy

History of Present Illness:
83yoF with hyperlipidemia, COPD, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with
concern for cholangitis and shock. Patient states earlier today
she had chills and abdominal pain, and at the urging of her
daughter, went to an OSH [**Name (NI) **]. She notes yesterday she had
nausea/vomiting and loose stools x 5 that were dark.
She went to OSH, where he SBP's were noted to be in the 60's.
Per report, she was started on dopamine peripherally and
received flagyl and cefoxitin. Unknown how much IVF she may have
received there. Per report, she was tachycardic, so a CTA was
done that showed ?PE.

Upon transfer to our ED inital vitals were, T 104 HR 100 BP
74/40 RR 16 Pox 98%. A right IJ was placed and she was started
on levophed. She received 5L IVF and had new oxygen requirement
of 4L NC subsequently. Labs were remarkable for lactate 2.8, WBC
20 with 7% bands, Hco3 18 with anion gap of 14, Na 131, Tbili
5.3, ALT 210, AST 201, AP 115. UA showed 22 WBC, few bacteria,
neg nitrites and leuk. Our radiologists were asked to read the
CTA from OSH and were not convinced of definitive PE;
recommended repeat CTA tomorrow. RUQ ultrasound showed: Dilated
intrahepatic bile ducts and CBD (to 1.3 cm). Moderately
distended GB with small neck stones. Pericholecystic fluid No
ductal stone detected, but limited evaluation of the distal
segment. Early cholecystitis and/or distal obstructive
choledocholithiasis cannot be excluded.

Surgery and ERCP were consulted. Surgery will follow along;
recommend ERCP, then will consider cholecystectomy. ERCP fellow
was contact[**Name (NI) **] by [**Name (NI) 153**] team and asked us to prepare for urgent
bedside ERCP, but had not yet staffed consult with attending.
Vitals on transfer BP 109/47 on levophed, RR 20-28, 100% on 4L
NC. CVP 14-16.

In the ICU, patient complains of SOB, stating it is difficult to
take in a breath. She also notes abdominal pain, and points
mostly to epigastric/RUQ area.

Imaging:

IMPRESSION:
1. Technically limited study as discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] at
11:43 a.m. on
[**2159-9-23**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11623**] over the phone. This study may be
repeated if
clinical confirmation of PE is required.
2. Trace bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.

CXR: [**2159-9-23**]
An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position
approximately 2 cm above the carina, though pointed towards the
right mainstem bronchus on this view.  A right IJ central line
is present, tip over distal SVC.
Question background COPD. There is upper zone redistribution,
but no overt
CHF. There is minimal atelectasis at both lung bases. Slightly
more patchy
opacity at the left lung base is noted, but unchanged compared
with [**2159-9-22**] at 23:30 p.m. Otherwise, no focal opacity is
identified. No effusion

RUQ U/S: [**2159-9-22**]
Moderately distended gallbladder with multiple neck stones, CBD
and intrahepatic bile duct dilation, and focal gallbladder wall
edema.
Obstructive choledocholithasis is a strong consideration.
Cholecystitis is
also possible. Cholangitis cannot be diagnosed with this
technique

ASSISTANTS:  [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Name Initial (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD/[**Name6 (MD) 91517**] [**Name8 (MD) 69814**], MD

OPERATION PERFORMED:  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with
intraoperative cholangiogram.

FINDINGS:  A large gallbladder with multiple gallstones,
moderate adhesions of the omentum to gallbladder, the cystic
ducts were enlarged and short.  Intraoperative cholangiogram
showed no filling defects and no ductal injury.

INDICATION:  The patient is an 83-year-old female who
presented on [**9-23**], with 2 days of epigastric abdominal
pain.  The patient was seen at outside hospital and was found
to have ductal dilatation associated with cholelithiasis.
Her total bilirubin was 6.4 with elevated LFTs.  The patient
was also hypertensive.  Therefore, she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] after getting cefoxitin and Flagyl.  On her level, the
patient was on dopamine drip.  Urgent ERCP was consulted and
the patient was admitted to the medical ICU for diagnosis of
cholangitis.  The patient then underwent the ERCP on [**9-23**], which showed lots of mild pus to it at the sphincter of
Oddi.  There was also a single periampullary diverticulum.
Due to cholangitic picture, stomach traction was not
performed and a stent were placed for drainage.  The patient
recovered from her cholangitis and was transferred to the
floor.  Her bilirubin continued to trend down and today
returned to [**Location 213**] limit of 1.3.  Although the patient is a
high surgical risk due to her history of COPD and multiple
medical morbidity, including history of radiation to the
upper abdomen, we felt that she would benefit form interval
cholecystectomy to prevent future episode of cholangitis.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was transferred from
[**Hospital Ward Name **] to wet campus preop area.  Consent was verified
and the patient was brought to the operating room and placed
on the table in supine position.  General anesthesia was
indu
