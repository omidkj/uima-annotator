History of Present Illness:
79 yo male admitted from OSH with hypotension, respiratory
failure and IMI. Arrived already intubated with IABP in place
for acute MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 74846**] to [**Hospital **] Hosp. on [**9-1**] with angina
and acute MI. Cath there revealed ramus 90%, RCA 95%, 80% PDA,
and 3 bare metal stents were placed in the RCA. Dopamine drip
started for hypotension at that time. Recurrent angina the next
day led to a repeat cath and echo showed severe MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] also was
shocked 4 times for VTach. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with IABP for
further management and surgery.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1112**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.4 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 45% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: *3.6 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aorta - Descending Thoracic: *3.2 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo;
basal
anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex -
hypo; lateral
apex - hypo; apex - hypo; remaining LV segments contract
normally.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Mildly dilated descending
aorta. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Torn
mitral chordae.
Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. The patient
received antibiotic
prophylaxis. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB: The patient is in extremis, with IABP well-positioned,
on high-dose
inotropes, very low cardiac output.

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. The LV
septum, infero-septal and antero-septal walls contract normally.
The anterior,
inferior and lateral walls are hypokinetic. . There is mild
global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Torn mitral
chordae are
present. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Flow is
directed
anteriorly. There appears to be a rupture of the antero-lateral
papillary
muscle. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB: Patient is on epinephrine and milrinone. RV systolic
fxn is
preserved. LV EF = 30-35%. Mild improvement of anterior wall.
There is a
well-seated and functioning mitral valve prosthesis. No leak, no
MR, no AI.
Aorta intact.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o eff, inf

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o eff, inf
CHEST PA LATERAL

HISTORY: Evaluate for effusion or infiltrate.

FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest compared to
prior study [**2112-9-6**]. Post-surgical changes of median sternotomy
are again noted. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has
been removed. Bilateral pleural effusions persist. There is also
bibasilar airspace density, likely atelectasis in the
post-operative setting. There is no pneumothorax. Bony
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated
bibasilar airspace opacity, likely atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**9-3**] and seen by cardiology. Continued on dopamine drip
with IABP in cardiogenic shock and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
urgent surgery after echo showed 4+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]/cabg x3
that evening and transferred to the CVICU in fair condition on
titrated epinephrine, milrinone, and insulin drips.IABP
removed.Extubated on POD #2 and transferred to the floor on POD
#4 to begin increasing his activity level.Chest tubes and pacing
wires removed without incident. He was gently diuresed toward
his preoperative wieght and continued amiodarone for postop
Afib.Continued to make good progress and was cleared for
discharge to home with services on POD #9. Pt. to make all
followup appts. as per discharge instructions.
