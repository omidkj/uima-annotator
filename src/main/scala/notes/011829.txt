Imaging:
DVT [**2186-6-25**]:
No evidence of DVT. Examination of popliteal veins was
suboptimal see comments above.
.
CTA Chest [**6-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary emboli within right lower lobe segmental and
subsegmental arteries.
2. Bibasilar airspace opacities, right greater than left, which
are nonspecific and may represent atelectasis or aspiration.
Developing infarction in the right lower lobe cannot be fully
excluded.
3. Feeding tube with tip positioned in a large axial hiatal
hernia, directed cephalad.
4. Small right pleural effusion.
.
EKG [**6-25**]
Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response. Left
axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block. Probable old
lateral myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2186-6-14**] no significant diagnostic change.
