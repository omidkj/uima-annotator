Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation/extubation, central line placement, arterial line
placement, paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 53 F hx of Hep C, B-thalessemia presents from OSH with
altered mental status, evidence of fall, and hypoxia. Patient is
intubated, sedated, and history is obtained from OSH records.

.

Patient was reportedly brought in to OSH ED after falling and
altered mental status X 2 days, bizarre speech (per husband) and
evidence of fall with bruises. At OSH, c-spine clinically
cleared, head CT neg, and she was found to have 2 rib fractures
as well as very large R infiltrates on CXR. She received
levaquin X 1. Tox screen at OSH revealed high tricyclic level of
670. She was guaiac positive and given 1U PRBCs and transferred
to [**Hospital1 **].

.

In [**Hospital1 **] ED, initial vs were: T104, HR 136, BP 118/67, R 30, 96%
NRB

She was noted to be tachypneic to 40's and saturations in 80's
on NRB, and was intubated for hypoxia and increased work of
breathing. A RIJ was placed. She received Vanc/Zosyn. Propofol
for sedation. BP dropped transiently to 88 on propofol.

.

On the floor, she is intubated and sedated.

[**2-4**] Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**2-11**] RUQ U/S:
 There is mild ascites, with the largest pocket in the left
lower
quadrant, 5.7 cm deep to the skin. This spot was marked for
paracentesis.

Limited views of the liver redemonstrate shrunken nodular
heterogeneous liver,
consistent with known cirrhosis.

IMPRESSION:

1. Mild ascites with the largest pocket in the left lower
quadrant marked for
paracentesis.

2. Findings consistent with known liver cirrhosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures who presented
with severe PNA and ARDS and was terminally extubated on [**2-16**].

# Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever,
bandemia, CXR are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial >
viral. It is unclear if she had any aspiration events. Low
clinical suspicion for PE. Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F
ratio on admission is 87. CXR is asymmetric but still likely had
ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19 (expected 16).  Pt still
requiring vent support and having episodes of hypoxia with
movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
placed [**2-7**] for four days. Culture data of limited value given
that cultures obtained after antibiotics administered. Patient
was on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/Cipro until made [**Last Name (un) 3225**] on [**2-13**]. Patient required
significant respiratory support with PEEP greater than 20 and
FIO2 greater than 50. On [**2-15**], noted resp alkalosis and
decreased RR. Patient [**Name (NI) 3225**] since [**2-13**]. Patient was terminally
extubated on [**2-16**].

# Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive
following intubation and sedation. Given degree of pneumonia,
sepsis if certainly possible. Was requiring levofed for labile
BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
weaned off.  Stable BPs since then. Patient [**Name (NI) 3225**] since [**2-13**].
Patient was terminally extubated on [**2-16**].

# Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly
weaning fentanyl and versed. Patient was methadone to reduce
narcotic requirements. Patient was placed on morphine drip on
[**2-16**] before terminal extubation.

# Rib fractures: Likely contributed to impaired respiratory
mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.

# Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a
lot of psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has
more likely causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental
status will be difficult to follow given current sedation and
paralytics.  Will continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.
 Paracentesis unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced
hyperalgesia. Evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and
ascites on RUQ U/S.  Patient [**Name (NI) 3225**] since [**2-13**].

# Constipation ?????? had BM over weekend with docusate and P
