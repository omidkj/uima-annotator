Admission Date:  [**2150-7-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2150-8-13**]


Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient was admitted to
[**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2150-7-14**] in congestive heart failure and
severe aortic stenosis.  She was treated medically there.
However, a discussion with the patient and her family led
them to the conclusion that she did require valve replacement
surgery and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2150-7-21**] to pursue valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was
significant for hypertension, congestive heart failure,
coronary artery disease, noninsulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, breast cancer status post lumpectomy times three,
psoriasis and glaucoma.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Toprol XL 100 mg p.o. q.d.
Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Isosorbide Sustained Release 30 mg p.o. q.d.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. h.s.
Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d.
Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
Multivitamin p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs on admission
revealed a temperature of 97.3??????F, a pulse of 54, a blood
pressure of 130/70 and an oxygen saturation of 99% on three
liters by nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was a
pleasant, comfortable female in no apparent distress.  On
head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the patient
had a slight droop of her left eyelid noted.  The neck was
unremarkable.

The coronary examination revealed a grade II/VI holosystolic
murmur.  On pulmonary examination, the patient had bibasilar
crackles.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, obese and
nondistended.  The groin was without ecchymosis or bruit.
The extremities had 1+ edema.  There were nonpalpable pulses;
however, there were positive Doppler signals in both of her
feet.  Neurologically, the patient was grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Laboratory values on admission
to the hospital were unremarkable.  BUN on admission was 21
with a creatinine of 1.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory on [**2150-7-21**], where she was found
to have severe aortic stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation,
a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% and three vessel
coronary artery disease.  She had previously refused coronary
artery bypass grafting in [**2149-2-5**].  However, she had
agreed to a consultation at this time.

The patient was seen on [**2150-7-22**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who
felt that the patient was a surgical candidate.  The patient
remained on the medical service until she was taken to the
operating room on [**2150-7-24**], at which time she underwent an
aortic valve replacement and a mitral valve replacement with
tissue valves as well as coronary artery bypass grafting
times one by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  Postoperatively, the patient
was transported from the operating room to the cardiac
surgery recovery unit on propofol, Levophed and milrinone
intravenous drips.

On postoperative day #1, the patient remained intubated, on a
mechanical ventilator.  She was improving hemodynamically.
She was atrioventricularly paced with her temporary
epicardial wires.  She remained on insulin drip as well as
the milrinone intravenous drip.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was placed on a low dose
dopamine drip.  She remained on insulin drip.  She also
remained on mechanical ventilation following an unsuccessful
attempt to wean her from the ventilator.  The patient
remained in the intensive care unit over the next three days,
on mechanical ventilation due to tachypnea and marginal
hypoxia with attempted ventilator weaning.

On [**2150-7-29**], the patient was noted to have significant
pleural effusions by x-ray and a right chest tube was placed.
Approximately 500 cc of serosanguinous fluid were obtained.
The patient was being diuresed.

On postoperative day #6, the patient remained on the
ventilator.  She was weaned and extubated later in the day on
postoperative day #6.  The patient's dopamine was weaned
slowly and was presently at 2 mcg/kg per minute.  The patient
was restless and agitated requiring intravenous Haldol at
times.  Her chest tube was discontinued and the patient
remained hemodynamically stable in the cardiac surgery
recovery unit.

On postoperative day #8, [**2150-8-1**], the patient was on nasal
cannula oxygen with marginal oxygen saturation in the 90% to
93% range.  She had gone into atrial fibrillation with a
stable blood pressure.  She was begun on amiodarone for the
atrial fibrillation and had been maintained on tube feedings
during her intensive care unit stay.

On postoperative day #9, the patient was begun on oral
intake.  She was started on NPH insulin and had been
progressing, although slowly, in a stable fashion.

On postoperative day #10, the patient remained on intravenous
heparin drip to anticoagulate her for her atrial
fibrillation, low dose dopamine drip, amiodarone and
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.    The patient had remained
somewhat agitated and disoriented during this time.

On [**2150-8-4**], postoperative day #11, the patient was noted to
have a drop in her hematocrit over the previous 24 hours.  A
chest x-ray was obtained and it was noted that the patient
had a significant left sided pleural effusion, thought to be
a hemothorax.  A chest tube was placed in the left pleural
space and 1400 cc of dark blood were obtained.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and a subsequent chest x-ray
showed the tube to be in good position with evacuation of the
effusion.

On [**2150-8-5**], the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
The chest tube had remained in place.  Her respiratory status
significantly improved over the next 24 hours with an oxygen
saturation up to 100%.  The patient had been started on
levofloxacin for a question of tracheobronchitis.  She did
not have positive sputum cultures; however, she clinically
improved from a pulmonary standpoint after the levofloxacin
was initiated.  The patient was transferred out of the
intensive care unit to the telemetry floor on postoperative
day #12.

On postoperative day #13, the patient remained in atrial
fibrillation.  Anticoagulation had been previously
discontinued due to the hemothorax.  However, this was being
re-initiated since the patient had remained stable with a
stable hematocrit for the prior few days.  Her oxygen
saturation was stable at 99%.  She was tolerating diuresis
and physical therapy was initiated.

On postoperative day #14, the patient had a prothrombin time
of 14.3 with an INR of 1.4 on her newly resumed Coumadin.  it
was felt that her chest tube should stay in until she was
again therapeutically anticoagulated to be sure that she did
not have any increased bleeding associated with her
anticoagulation.  On [**2150-8-8**], the chest tube was
discontinued when her INR had reached 2.1 and there was no
evidence of bleeding.

In the evening of [**2150-8-9**], the patient had a telemetry strip
with what appeared to be ventricular tachycardia and an
electrophysiology consultation was obtained.  It was their
feeling that this was artifact, as it had not recurred since
that one episode.

On the following day, [**2150-8-10**], it was noted that the patient
had a significant inflammation of the right lower extremity
in the area of the wound, thought to be a cellulitis.  The
patient had already been on levofloxacin for five days and,
at this time, was begun on vancomycin intravenously.  A
culture of that wound was sent and the result of that was
sparse growth of E. coli.  However, since the patient
clinically improved over the next few days on the vancomycin,
it was felt judicious to leave her on the vancomycin despite
not having specific bacteria to be treated with it.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable over the next few
days.  The patient is to continue on her antibiotic course of
levofloxacin for tracheobronchitis as well as vancomycin for
cellulitis of her right lower extremity, which is improving.
She is oxygenating well and remains stable.
