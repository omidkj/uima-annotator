CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Seizure with respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51 year old female
with Down syndrome, dementia, seizure disorder and
paraparesis, and aphasic since cervical cord surgery, who has
been living in a nursing home and attending day care.  At day
care, ten days prior to her transfer to the [**Hospital1 346**], the patient had a witnessed seizure
involving the upper extremities lasting for fifteen minutes.
The patient was shifted to the [**Hospital6 33**] where she
was found to have respiratory distress.  Chest x-ray showed
right infiltrate which was consistent with aspiration.  The
patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit and started on
antiepileptics.  She became toxic at very low doses of
Dilantin and then on Tegretol and was successfully put on
Trileptal.  The dose of Trileptal was titrated up in relation
to the occurrence of myoclonus.

The patient was started on a course of intravenous
Clindamycin and Tequin and supplemental oxygen to maintain
saturation between 96 and 98% and physiotherapy, pulmonary
toilette and inhalers.  Blood cultures were negative and
sputum cultures grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus sensitive to Tequin, Gentamicin, Bactrim, Tetracycline
and Vancomycin.

On [**2147-9-22**], the patient developed mild congestive heart
failure and was diuresed with Lasix 40 mg p.o.  The patient
continued to be lethargic without return to her previous
mental status maintaining inadequate oral intake of pureed
diet and needing supplemental oxygen.

Laboratories showed an increase in TSH and the dose of
Synthroid was increased to 0.15 mg q.d.  The patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Down syndrome.
2.  Dementia likely due to Down syndrome.
3.  Seizure disorder about once monthly seizures which last
only a minute or two but in which her postictal state would
last for about 24 hours.  She was not on any antiseizure
medicines at the time of admission to the [**Hospital6 3426**].
4.  C3-C4 spinal fusion, paraparesis, minimally responsible,
unable to do activities of daily living, status post spinal
cord surgery.
5.  Dysphagia and previous gastrostomy tube, now eating soft
foods with recent swallowing study felt to be encouraging.
6.  Hypothyroidism, recent TSH with increase in the Synthroid
dose.
7.  History of diverticulitis.
8.  Chronic incontinence of urine and stool for which she
wears diapers.
9.  Urinary tract infections are frequent.
10. Chronically loose stools.
11. History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in
sputum.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Sulfa, Erythromycin and Dilantin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Folic Acid 1 mg q.d.
2.  Vitamin C 500 mg q.d.
3.  Zinc 200 mg q.d.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
5.  Beconase one spray each nostril b.i.d.
6.  Ventolin MDI q.i.d.
7.  Synthroid 0.125 mcg q.d.
8.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
9.  Trileptal 150 mg b.i.d.

The patient is nonverbal and the history was obtained from
records and the brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 23306**], who is her health
care proxy, and the rest of the family who are very
supportive.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was alert,
afebrile, vital signs stable, saturation in mid 90s on blow
by mask at 40%.  Skin no rashes.  Mucous membranes are dry.
The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation. Conjunctiva anicteric.  Oropharynx is dry. The
neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Chest - coarse
breath sounds anteriorly.  Cardiovascular - distant, regular
rate and rhythm, no murmur appreciated.  The abdomen is soft,
bowel sounds present.  Extremities - no edema or cyanosis.
Back - small decubitus ulcer.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit
46.4, platelets 343,000.  Prothrombin time 13.2, partial
thromboplastin time 27.7, INR 1.2.  Sodium 142, potassium
4.0, chloride 101, CO2 32, blood urea nitrogen 11, creatinine
0.9, glucose 112.  Albumin 2.9, calcium 8.6, magnesium 2.2,
phosphate 3.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Service and placed on supplemental oxygen and course of
Tequin and Clindamycin was continued.  After admission to the
hospital, the patient underwent a swallow study which showed
that the patient aspirated pureed food and was made NPO.  CAT
scan of the chest was done on [**2147-10-4**], which was negative
for primary embolus and the chest x-ray showed mild chronic
heart failure and the patient was started on Captopril.

Code status was discussed with the brother and the patient's
code status was changed from full code to no shock but
intubation was permitted.  A gastric tube was passed on
[**2147-10-4**], and the patient was started on her
prehospitalization medications.  Enteral feeds were started
on [**2147-10-5**].

The patient was weaned to two liters of oxygen via nasal
prong but had intermittent periods of desaturation with
tachycardia of unknown origin.  The patient continued to
deteriorating and was intubated for respiratory distress on
[**2147-10-6**], and was put on mechanical ventilation, placed
empirically on Vancomycin and Gentamicin while the results of
the culture were awaited.

The patient had an episode of hematuria on [**2147-10-6**].
Genitourinary services were consulted and thought it was
traumatic due to the Foley or due to chronic Foley catheter
placement and did not deem any intervention necessary at this
time.

The patient also had severe yeast infection of the labia and
groin and was treated with antifungal powder, with
suppositories.  The decubitus ulcer on the left lateral
malleolus and sacrum was treated with Duoderm and waffle
boots.  The patient became hypertensive to 180/122 with tonic
seizures.  The seizures resolved with Ativan administration
and the patient's pressure normalized and showed downward
trend and required pressor infusion to maintain adequate
blood pressure.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction.

An electroencephalogram done on [**2147-10-7**], showed evidence of
burst suppression with right hemispheric spikes which were
asymmetric suggestive of encephalopathy due to anoxia,
benzodiazepines, barbiturates or other interictal states but
structural lesions could not be ruled out as the patient
looked more alert but was hemodynamically unstable and would
have been a poor surgical candidate.  Further studies were
not carried out at that time.

The patient remained stable and underwent delayed pressors
over the course of the next few days and initially did not
show much respiratory effort when weaning was attempted.
Over the next few days, the patient was weaned to pressor
support and then extubated on [**2147-10-15**].  The patient was
weaned off the pressors on [**2147-10-12**].  The systolic pressures
tended to drop into the 70s and 80s when the patient was
asleep but there was no evidence of decreased perfusion and
the pressures were returned to the 90s to 100s systolic when
the patient was aroused.

The patient continued to have peak copious secretions which
required frequent suctioning and aggressive pulmonary
toilette.  On [**2147-10-17**], the patient had three small
consecutive seizure episodes witnessed by the neurology team
and hypoxia with decreased saturation over the course of the
day.  There was a suspicion of repeat aspiration and the
patient was reintubated after a discussion with the family.
The patient continued to be intubated and ventilated for the
next week and showed minimal spontaneous effort.

The course of antibiotics, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, was
completed on [**2147-10-20**], and the patient had a percutaneous
endoscopic jejunostomy tube placed on the same day. On
[**2147-10-24**], the patient had increased thick tan colored
secretions, a spike in temperature and an increase in the
white blood cell count.  The patient was pancultured and
stool sent for Clostridium difficile analysis.  The patient
was started empirically on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for wide
spectrum coverage.  The preliminary sputum culture show
