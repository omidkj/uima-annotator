Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Reason for Transfer: CHF/Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right-to-left femoral-to-femoral bypass
with polytetrafluorethylene. (PTFE)


History of Present Illness:
75F y/o with HTN, HLD, s/p endovasculary repaired AAA [**2151-5-20**],
CAD s/p emergent CABGX4 for STEMI [**1-19**], CHF (EF = 20-25%),
readmitted [**2-14**] w/ LLE vasc occlusion, s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**2-18**] now with
worsening SOB, episodic hypotension and worsening L pleural
effusion.

Recently admitted in [**2155-12-28**] for STEMI, went to CABG from cath
lab, required 3 pressors + a balloon pump pre-operatively and
several days post-op. She had a post-operative EF of 20%.
Post-operative course was notable for fluid overload and need
for diureses which was difficult given marginal cardiac output.
Extubated on post-op day 10. Discharged home on [**2-4**]. She was
re-admitted [**Date range (1) 5553**] for progressive SOB since discharge, was
found to have a L pleural effusion, underwent successful
thoracentesis, repeat echo again showed her EF to be 20-25%.

On [**2-13**] presented to OSH, was readmitted [**2-14**] with progressive
dyspnea, N&V, RLQ pain and LLE pain and numbness. [**Last Name (un) **] as found
to have a cold left extremity and loss of distal LLE and was
admitted to vascular surgery.  Prior to surgery, patient
received 3L volume, interspersed with lasix. On [**2156-2-18**], patient
went to OR for R to L fem-fem bypass with PTFE. EF was 15%
intra-op and patient received albumin and fluid. POD1, she had a
thoracentesis that drained -1L cc simple fluid and felt a lot
better.  In subsequent days, however, patient became
progressively more tachypnic, and under the guidance of the IP
team, patient was aggressively diured with progressively higher
doses of IV lasix.  Throughout her entire hospital course
(cardiac surgery team, vasc surgery team), she appears to be
currently net even.

On the morning of transfer, patient was in severe respiratory
distress with RR 30s, desatting, and hypotensive with SBP 70s
(after receiving 20mg IV lasix and carvedilol 3.125), limiting
diuresis.  She has an IJ in place, showing CVP 15-17.  On exam,
she had no LE edema, but does have significant sacral edema.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR [**2156-2-14**]:
1. Increased moderate left pleural effusion with overlying
atelectasis,
underlying consolidation can not be excluded. Possibly small
right pleural
effusion.
2. Right lower lobe atelectasis versus infection. Clinical
correlation is
recommended.

CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC [**2156-2-17**]:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with a large left nonhemorrhagic
pleural
effusion and moderate right pleural effusion.
2. Mild right renal artery stenosis.
3. Subcentimeter hypodensities within the liver and right kidney
which remain
too small to characterize, statistically representing cysts.
4. Replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric
artery.
5. Thrombosis of the left common iliac artery with
reconstitution of the
distal common iliac artery at the bifurcation. slow flow within
the left
extremity vessels. There is two-vessel runoff on the left. The
posterior
tibial artery is not visualized.

PLEURAL FLUID [**2156-2-19**]:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Mesothelial cells, macrophages,
neutrophils and lymphocytes.

CXR [**2156-2-23**]:
Moderate left pleural effusion which reaccumulated following
thoracentesis is Stable since [**2-22**], as are
small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, severe cardiomegaly,
and pulmonary vascular engorgement. Today, there is no finding
of interstitial pulmonary edema. Right jugular line ends
centrally. No pneumothorax.
