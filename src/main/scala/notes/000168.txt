Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. hemodialysis
2. cauterization of bleeding from tooth extraction site


History of Present Illness:
46 yo AA woman with h/o SLE, ESRD on hemodialysis, htn,
hyperlipidemia, and cardiomyopathy, CHF, and recent
immunosuppression
with tacrolimius/cellcept/IVIG in an attempted preparation for
receiving a kidney transplant from her sister presented
initially
on [**8-23**] with atypical chest pain. She had no ischemic EKG
changes, and her initial set of cardiac enzymes was flat. She
also complained
of epigastric/RUQ pain. Finally, she had subacute complaints of
subjective fever and bronchitis symptoms. In the ED, her
vitals were T = 97.5, (T@ dialysis = 99.2), BP = 191/97, HR =
70, RR = 20 and 100% RA.
.
She had severe hyperkalemia to 8.1, and underwent urgent
hemodialysis.
In hemodialysis, she developed significant bleeding from a site
of recent tooth extraction, and then arterial bleeding from her
AV fistula site when the HD line was disconnected. She was
managed with
DDAVP 15mcg IV x i, 10units of cryoprecipitate; additionally,
ENT
stopped the oral bleeding with Ag local tx, and AV fistula
bleeding
stopped after 55min of continuous pressure.  The working
suspicion
is that she was suffering from uremic platelet dysfunction.
.
She was admitted to MICU after she had developed persistent
bleeding from the site of her recent tooth extraction as well
as arterial bleeding from her AV fistula site. The bleeding
from her tooth extraction site stopped after she was seen by ENT
and this was treated with local Ag therapy.  The bleeding from
her AV fistula site stopped after continuous pressure for 55min,

and DDAVP.
.
Overnight, several events took place. First, she remained chest
pain
free, but her troponin trended from 0.06 to 0.26 and then back
down
to 0.06 with the only EKG changes of new TWI in V6 and
borderline
Twave flattening in lead I.  Her CK and MB remained flat
throughout.
Secondly, she was ruled out for AAA and PE by CTangiogram.
Next,
she had a Tmax of 101.6, and repeat blood cultures were drawn.
She additionally underwent CTangiogram of torso: No evidence of
PE; no aortic aneurysm/dissection; no pathologic LAD;
non-specific
thickening of the pylorus. Also, her labs were significant for
the following:
.
- evidence of hemolysis with hapto < 20, elevated LDH
- no evidence of TTP, no schistocytes on peripheral smear,
and no evidence of DIC (nl coags, fibrinogen elevated)
.
- platelets remained stable in 50's range
- DIC Ab returned positive; heme/onc consulted re:
anticoagulation
strategy in setting of recent significant bleeding
.
- transaminitis trending downward
- elevated amylase/lipase - now trending downward.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 46 yo AA woman with h/o SLE, ESRD on hemodialysis, htn,
hyperlipidemia, and cardiomyopathy, CHF, recent immunosuppresion
presented with atypical chest pain, abdominal pain, and
severe hyperkalemia; now stable from MICU after uremic bleeding.
.
1. Chest Pain:

Presentation was atypical for angina, and she ruled out for
acute MI.  Over her MICU course, there was concern for aortic
dissection or other etiology for her chest pain, and she
underwent
a CTangiogram of the torso.  This showed no evidence of any
aortic dissection, aneurysm, or a pulmonary embolism.
Her chest pain resolved.

.

2. Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea:

This was a non-specific abdominal pain.  On
review, it turns out that this is a chronic complaint.
Her abdominal CT did not demonstrate any acute pathology.
She does have chronically elevated amylase/lipase and LFT's
that date back several years. It may be that this is related
to her SLE or potentially autoimmune hepatitis. Her
abdominal pain had resolved by time of discharge. She
will need to f/u with her PCP and nephrologist for further
management.

.

3. Fever:

She defervesced over her hospital course, and
her infec
