Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6029**]
Chief Complaint:
bloody stool and dizziness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69yo M h/o peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal
insufficiency, type II diabetes, recurrent DVT on Coumadin and
diastolic CHF who presented to the ED on [**2160-9-4**] after noting
black tarry stools x 2 days and experiencing an episode of
dizziness in which he fell to the floor in his kitchen. Patient
denies LOC on falling. He did not hit his head, and remembers
event well.
.
On arrival to the ED, VS were T: [**Age over 90 **]F, BP 107/32, HR 58, RR 20,
SaO2 97% RA. Orthostatics were done, demonstrating supine BP
115/80, upright 104/70. Initial labs were significant for hct
16.3 and INR 7.3, with grossly heme+ black stool. He refused NG
lavage. He was given 2U FFP, 10mg Vitamin K SC, 1L NS, and 2U
PRBC. After transfusion, hct had only increased from 16.3 to
17.8. ECG demonstrated NSR at 60bpm, nl axis and intervals, TW
flattening in inferior leads, TWI V6, no ST elevations; no
significant change from prior. CK was 170(6), with troponin of
0.09, which is his baseline in the context of chronic renal
insufficiency. He denied CP or SOB. He denied any new
medications or significant dietary changes, and stated that his
coumadin was last checked 1 week ago. He believes his coumadin
dose may have been increased, but is unsure.
.
In the MICU,  FFP and Vitamin K was given for supertherapeutic
INR. EGD revealed multiple non-bleeding 2-5mm shallow ulcers
likely secondary to NSAID used. There was also a single
non-bleeding red lesion in the the proximal body of stomach with
minor erosions at the GE junction.  During his MICU stay, blood
pressure was controlled with Hydralazine and Captopril. The
patient experienced some pulmonary congestion in the context of
aggressive fluid replacement and was managed with Lasix. As HCT
had stabilized, patient was transferred to the floor ternoon for
further management.

EGD: [**2160-9-5**]: multiple non-bleeding 2-5mm shallow ulcers in 1st
and second portion of duodenum. Single non-bleeding red lesion
in proximal body of stomach, and minor erosions at the GE
junction. The gastric lesion was of unclear significance and
would not bleed upon provocation.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
1.GI Bleeding: Given EGD, bleeding likely due to NSAID-induced
duodenal ulcers or gastritis with ulceration at GE junction in
setting of an INR of 7.3 on [**2160-9-4**]. Warfarin was held; patient
was started on a pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]. HCT was monitored
closely and patient was discharged after it had stabilized for
greater than 48 hrs. He did not have a colonoscopy while
in-patient; he will be having one as an out-patient. This was
discussed with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.	     	
2. History of multiple DVTs: INR 7.3 ([**9-4**])--> 1.2 ([**9-11**]).
Bilateral LENIs on [**2160-9-5**] were negative for DVT.
Anti-coagulation held initially given GI bleeding. Given h/o
multiple DVT's and concern about potential for clot, warfarin
was restarted prior to discharge. At time of discharge INR was
not yet therapeutic. He will have his INR followed by his PCP as
he usually does.
.
3.HTN: Patient had been hypertensive in MICU despite GI bleed.
He was started on captopril for blood pressure control.
Eventually he was transitioned over to lisinopril and
metoprolol. He will continue to have his blood pressure
monitored by daily home care nurse and his PCP; medications will
be further titrated if necessary.
.
4. L lower extremity leg ulcer: No obvious infection.  Evaluated
by podiatry service -daily application of aquacel and dry kerlex
was recommended.  Patient will be seen daily by wound care nurse
following discharge.
