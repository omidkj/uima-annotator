HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old man
with no significant past medical history who presented on the
day of operation for a mitral valve repair.  His presenting
symptoms were shortness of breath approximately six months
ago for which he visited his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**]
found him to have a heart murmur and atrial fibrillation.  He
had been cardioverted and placed on aspirin, atenolol and
Prinivil and then he was referred to his cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5310**], who referred him to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for surgery.  On
presentation, the patient was in good health and felt well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was
significant for an appendectomy in [**2079**], Achilles surgery in
[**2116**], a fractured leg in [**2115**] and atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atenolol 25 mg q.d.
Prinivil 2.5 mg q.d.
Aspirin 325 mg q.d., discontinued one week prior to surgery.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a heart rate of 80 and
a blood pressure of 113/77.  In general, he was a well
appearing, middle aged man.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination, the pupils were equal, round and reactive
to light and accommodation.  The neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention.  The chest
examination was clear to auscultation.  The heart examination
revealed an irregular rhythm with a III/VI murmur heard best
at the apex, radiating to the axilla.  The abdomen was soft.
The extremities had no edema.  Neurologically, the patient
was alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
8,300 with a hematocrit of 32 and a platelet count of
118,000.  Chemistries revealed a sodium of 137, potassium of
4.3, chloride of 104, bicarbonate of 25, BUN of 18,
creatinine of 0.9 and glucose of 108.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION REPORT:
1.  Arteriography demonstrated normal coronary arteries in a
right dominant system.
2.  Hemodynamics demonstrated normal right and left sided
pressures.
3.  Left ventriculography demonstrated normal systolic
function with an ejection fraction of 60%.  There was no
regional wall motion abnormality.  There was severe 4+ mitral
regurgitation.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on the
day of operation for mitral valve repair.  His presenting
symptoms were shortness of breath, which led to a cardiac
catheterization that, in summary, showed normal coronary
arteries, normal ventricular function and 4+ severe mitral
regurgitation.  He received his Operating Room on [**2131-2-6**],
during which he received a mitral valve repair with
neocortical [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex x 4 to antrum leaflet.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit for his postoperative care.  His postoperative care
was excellent and unremarkable.  He was found to be in atrial
fibrillation, as he was prior to the operation.  As before,
the patient continued to refuse Coumadin for anticoagulation
and was therefore allowed to continue on aspirin for his
anticoagulation.  He was also started on amiodarone for a
better rhythm control.

The patient is being discharged in good health and good
condition, feeling well and tolerating a regular diet and
pain medications p.o.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] and
his cardiologist.
