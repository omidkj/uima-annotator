Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Line

History of Present Illness:
83 year old male with history of CAD, CRI, PAF on coumadin, DM
presents from rehab for unresponsiveness with a finger stick in
the 20s discovered at rehab. He was noted to be cold and clammy
and very restless. He was given glucose gel with improvement to
the 150s initially. Also per the NH notes, the patient had a
seizure like episode lasting <1 minute and was persistantly
unresponsive despite giving the glucose. EMS saw him and got FS
100 but unarousable enroute to the ED.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] for Urosepsis; at
which time he was treated with Meropenem and subsequently
Tigecycline with cultures growing MDR Klebsiella sensetive only
to Tigecycline. Renal U/S at the time did not show evidence of
collection and blood cultures remained negative. He was
discharged to rehab [**1-29**] and per the notes, he has not been
eating over the past few days. They were also doing straight
caths for poor UOP (but was getting his flomax)
.
On arrival to the ED vitals were BP 105/50 T96 HR 90 100%RA;
fingerstick 15 on arrival and he was given Dextrose with
improvement to 92 and mental status improved. CT head done
initially neegative. but then BP started to drop around 7:30am
to SBP70s. He was given 4L IVF, Vanc/Zosyn given initially and
CVL placed. Additional history per the wife obtained regarding
recent UTI and thus Tigecycline given. Blood cultures were drawn
and PICC line removed. He started to desat to 93% and make brisk
UOP; so fluids held and patient was started on low dose
Levophed. Finger stick done again and noted to be 40 so D5
started. Patients labs notable for WBC 10.2, Lactate 0.8, INR
3.0, CK 40 Trop 0.03, Cr 2.3. Glucose 17-->repeat 92 but then 42
and started on D5. His mental status improved after the
Dextrose. U/A was grossly positive and given history he was
given 100mg Tigecycline. A CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia,
Blood cultures were sent. CVL was placed and patient received 4L
IVF. Levophed was started for persitant hypotension. PICC line
was removed and sent for culture.
.
Currently patient denies any pain. Denies cough, fevers, chills,
N/V, abdominal discomfort, urinary urgency/frequency.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo male with h/o CAD, PAF, CHF, Renal Cell CA, CRI presents
with unresponsiveness found to be hypoglycemic and have UTI.
.
# Hypotension: On presentation, patient presented with SBP into
70s with a CVL placed and he was given fluids(4L) with modest
improvement and subsequently started on Levophed. The etiology
may have been sepsis vs volume depletion. Patient's blood
pressure quickly stabilized. He was continued on Tigecycline and
weaned off of Levophed within 24 hours of arrival to the ICU.
Aside from the urine culture, the blood and PICC line cultures
showed no growth. Patient was normotensive during the rest of
his hospital stay.

# Urinary Tract Infection
