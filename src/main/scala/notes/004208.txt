NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN.

FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the
normally midline structures or major vascular territorial
infarct. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
Mild periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent
with chronic microvascular ischemia. The overlying soft tissues
and osseous structures are unremarkable. Incidental note is made
of bony nonfusion of the posterior arch of C1. There is
opacification of the left mastoid air cells without osseous
destruction. The visualized nasopharynx appears normal and
symmetric.

IMPRESSION:
1. Opacification of the left mastoid air cells.
2. No hemorrhage or mass effect.

ECHO:
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal  image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical  views. Suboptimal image quality as
the patient was difficult to position.  Suboptimal image quality
- body habitus. Suboptimal image quality -  ventilator.
Conclusions:
The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low  normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of
the inferior and posterior  walls. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is  dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No  aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is no
pericardial effusion.

RENAL Ultrasound:
PORTABLE RENAL ULTRASOUND

INDICATION: 83-year-old woman with acute renal failure. Rule out
obstruction.

FINDINGS: The bedside study is markedly limited by patient's
body habitus and inability to cooperate. Limited views of the
right and left kidneys were obtained. A right kidney measures
8.7 cm, left kidney was not measured. No hydronephrosis is
detected on these limited views. Several simple cysts are noted
bilaterally, measuring up to 2 cm in size.

IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study. No hydronephrosis. Several
simple cysts.

CXR:
CHEST ONE VIEW: Cardiac size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
unchanged. Persistent elevated left hemidiaphragm. Left-sided
pacemaker with intact lead terminating over the right ventricle.
Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions. Persistent
vascular congestion and multifocal airspace opacity
predominantly in the lower lobes. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged radiographic chest; likely
mild CHF and multifocal pneumonia.
