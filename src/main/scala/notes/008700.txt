Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2101-8-8**] Coronary artery bypass graft (left internal mammary
artery > left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft > obtuse
marginal)  Aortic valve replacement (23 mm [**Company **] porcine)


History of Present Illness:
86 year old male with right sided chest pain about 2-3 weeks ago
while working in the yard.  At this time, he attributed the pain
to an upper respiratory infection.  Over the weekend of [**7-30**] he
noticed that when walking uphill he developed substernal chest
pain without radiation after about 50 feet.  With cessation of
exercise, the pain dissipated after 4-5 minutes.  This was
reproducible.  He rested at home with very little physical
activity for 2 days and was free of symptoms until [**8-1**] when he
attempted to be more active.  At this time he spoke with his
physician who instructed him to come to the ED by ambulance.

At [**Hospital **] hospital, he had a normal ECG and cardiac enzymes
were
negative.  An echocardiogram showed moderate aortic stenosis and
normal ventricular function.  Coronary angiography revealed a
90% distal Left main
stenosis and a 70% mid LAD stenosis.  He was transferred for
surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2101-8-5**] ECHO
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 -= 45%), with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic [**Month/Day/Year 5236**].
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
Patient is in SR, on low dose NTG infusion.
There is a prosthetic AVR with residual mean gradient 14 mmHg.
No leak, no AI.
Improved biventricular systolic fxn.
Trace MR.

Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis 40-59%.

[**2101-8-5**] Chest CT
1. Aortic valve calcification.
2. Mild thoracic aortic calcification mostly involving the
distal aortic
arch, as above.
3. Severe coronary artery calcifications.
4. Evidence of prior asbestos exposure, including multiple
calcified pleural plaques. No pleural effusion.
5. Likely history of previous granulomatous exposure, including
a calcified granuloma and a few calcified subcarinal lymph
nodes.
6. Borderline mediastinal adenopathy, as above.
7. Evidence of prior cholecystectomy.
8. Minimal splenic diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] was transferred in from outside hospital and
underwent preoperative workup including a carotid ultrasound and
an echocardiogram.  He was ready for surgery and was taken to
the operating [****] and underwent coronary artery bypass
graft and aortic valve replacement surgery.  See operative
report for further details.  He received vancomycin for
perioperative antibiotics since he was in the hospital
preoperatively.  He was transfered to the intensive care unit
for hemodynamic management.  Within 24 hours he awoke
neurologically [**Month/Year (2) 5235**] and was extubated.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry unit for further recovery.  He did
experience a brief episode (approximately 2 hours) of rate
controlled atrial fibrillation.  Beta blocker was titrated
accordingly and the patient returned to sinus rhythm.  The
physical therapy service was consulted for post-operative
strength and mobility.  Post-operative course was uneventful and
the patient was discharged to rehab on POD 4.
