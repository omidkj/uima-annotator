Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right and left heart catheterization at OSH


History of Present Illness:
62F with DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD (IMI '[**67**]; RCA stent '[**70**]; LCX
stents [**10-20**] @ [**Hospital1 336**], [**4-20**] @ [**Hospital1 18**], and [**7-21**] @ [**Hospital1 1474**] for
instent thrombosis) developed acute chest discomfort which is
predominantly nausea Saturday am, lasted several hours, remitted
for an hour, then recurred and so she presented to the ED at
[**Hospital3 417**] Hosp. Her prior ischemic pains were substernal
chest tightness. EKG there c/w inferior STEMI and she was taken
to the cath lab.
.
From OSH notes, access was difficult [**3-16**] body habitus. Cath
showed normal LMCA, 40% ostial, 60% mid, and 80% distal lesions
in the LAD; Hazy prox lesion in the LCX at the site of prior
stents and 95% stenosis; and a proximally occluded RCA. PTCA to
the LCX required several balloon dilations and after recoil
there was 50-60% residual stenosis. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for consideration of CABG; Reopro gtt started at 1am for planned
duration 12 hours. RFA and RFV sheaths in place at time of
transfer.

use, remote history of cigarette smoking.  H/O ETOH abuse, no
ETOH x 10 years.  H/O cocaine use, none for many years.

Pertinent Results:
EKG:
presentation: SR STE in II, III, aVF with Q waves. STE in V3-V4
as well. STD with biphasic Twaves in I, aVL.
post-cath: No significant change from above.
[**Hospital1 18**] arrival: still with STE & Q in inferior and ant precordial
leads; same STD in high lateral leads.
.
CARDIAC CATH:
report from [**Hospital3 417**] Hosp:
normal LMCA, 40% ostial, 60% mid, and 80% distal lesions in the
LAD; Hazy prox lesion in the LCX at the site of prior stents and
95% stenosis; and a proximally occluded RCA. PTCA to the LCX
required several balloon dilations and after recoil there was
50-60% residual stenosis
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**3-/2097**] (report from OSH): EF 45-50
%, diastolic dysfunciton and moderate concentric LVH.  Moderate
AS with a valve area of 1.2cm and peak gradient 27, mean
gradient 18.

[**2176-10-22**] CXR
Enlarged heart. Prominent hila with pulmonary vascular
congestion. No obvious evidence for consolidation or pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
62F with DM2, extensive prior CAD including multiple instent
thromboses, now presents with ~18 hrs of nausea found to have
inferior wall Q-wave MI
.
# CAD/Ischemia: IMI due to instent thrombosis of LCx stent with
chronically occluded RCA. Attempted PTCA at [**Hospital3 417**] with
sub-optimal angiographic result and no resolution of ST
elevations, so referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval. However,
given Q wave infarction and pt's co-morbid
conditions--uncontrolled DM2, h/o of lung disease requiring
trach in the past, pt. previously denied for CABG and would be
denied on same grounds at this time. Pt. was transferred on
heparin and abciximab, asa, plavix, high dose atorvastatin with
arterial and venous sheaths still in place. Decision was made
not to recath as imaging from [**Hospital3 **] did not show an
intervenable lesion. Pt. had an episode of bleeding from around
her sheaths and so they were pulled and she had an episode of
bleeding from the venous sheath site. Pressure was held for 30
minutes and the bleeding resolved, Hct remained essentially
stable so there was no concern for major bleeding. After leaving
the CCU pt. had multiple episodes of sharp chest pain worse w/
palpation of chest associated with shortness of breath and
anxiety. These episodes were not associated with EKG changes,
her cardiac enzymes continued to trend downward and her symptoms
were resolved with reassurance.

.
# Pump: h/o diastolic CHF with EF 40-45%, echo here showed mild
LV systolic function. Hypokinesis of basal half of inferior and
inferiolateral segment and distal half of septum. EF of 45%. Pt.
did not appear acutely volume overloaded on discharge, she had
chronic appearing edema of her legs which did not change over
the course of her admission. Her furosemide was held because of
concern for hyportension after recieving increased doses of
carvedilol. We uptitrated her carvedilol from 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] at home
to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] on d/c. Her lisinopril was decreased to 20mg daily
because of carvedilol induced hypotension.
.
# Rhythm: SR/ST. Monitored on Telemetry, little ectopy (PVC's).
Pt. had warfarin listed in her admission medications, but her
INR was 1.3 on presentation.
.
# Valves: Murmur suggests AS consistent with prior report of
moderate AS. Will check echo as above.
.
# HTN: Pt. was actually hypotensive through most of this
admission, most likely secondary to her partial right
ventricular infarct.
.
# DM: A1c was 9.1 so poorly controlled. She was maintained on
her home dose of insulin as we did not have time to uptitrate
her basal insulin.
.
# Depression: continued escitalopram
.
# Code: full
.
# Communication: with patient
