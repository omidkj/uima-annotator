Brief Hospital Course:
42M s/p stab wound to epigastrum in the ER was hemodynamically
stable with negative FAST.  Wound explored in trauma bay and
penetration of anterior fascia was noted, therefore patient was
taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy and admitted to
the trauma service.  Small bleeding was noted from a gastric
artery, which was ligated, otherwise no additional injuries were
found.  Please see op note for further details.

Patient was transferred to the floor where on post-op day one
his nasogatric tube was pulled and he was put on a clear diet,
which he tolerated well.  His foley was also pulled, however he
was unable to void and his foley was replaced.  Pain was well
controlled with a dilaudid PCA.

On hosptial day 3, patient was evaluated in the morning and
appeared to be doing well, however later was found with
decreased mental status and a code blue was called.  Patient was
hypotensive to 80s/40s but maintained a pulse and adequate
respirations.  He was given narcan and IV fluid and mental
status improved slightly.  He was transferred to the TSICU in
stable condition.  Central venous access was obtained as well as
peripheral arterial access.  His hematocrit was stable and abd
nontender.  His mental status continued to be clouded and he had
a CT head which was negative.  Eventually, his mental status
improved without specific intervention.  Ultimately, the
etiology of this incident was not determined.

Patient then was stable for transfer to the floor, however
developed an ileus.  Pt was kept NPO and eventually was able to
tolerate a regular diet and had normal bowel movements at the
time of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after getting stabbed in your
belly with a screwdriver.  You had an operation to look for
damage from this injury and were only found to have a small
bleeding vessel that was repaired.

You had an episode where your mental status was decreased and
your blood pressure was low and therefore you were transfered to
the ICU overnight.  You were given some fluids and you improved
without any intervention.  During this time you had a central
venous line and arterial line placed for better monitoring of
your status, which were then removed when you returned to the
floor.

Your abdominal distention slowly resolved and at the time of
discharge you were having normal bowel movements and were able
to eat normally.

Your staples were removed and steristrips were placed over your
wound.  You can leave these in place until your follow-up or
until they fall off on their own.

Your metoprolol was increased to 75mg from 50mg, which you
should take every day.  If you start having dizziness when you
stand or have problems with fainting you should call your
regular doctor to discuss your medications.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in trauma clinic in 2 weeks.  Call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6429**].
