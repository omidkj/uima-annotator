Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2134-5-17**]: PRE-BYPASS: The probe could not be advanced beyond
the mid-esophagus. Even at that level, windows and views were
very limited. Therefore it was not possible to assess
ventricular fxn or the tricuspid valve. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is markedly
dilated The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is mild mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is no
pericardial effusion. POST-BYPASS: Limited views of the
prosthetic mitral valve were seen. From what was visible, the
valve seemed well-seated without perivalvular leak or MR. Could
not assess LV or RV fxn. Aortic valve appeared unchanged. Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 6507**] assisted on exam. We recommended esophagoscopy and
transthoracic echo on this patient.
Echo [**5-24**]: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. 3. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. 4. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
motion of the mitral valve prosthetic leaflets appears normal.
The transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. A small
perivalvular mitral prosthesis leak is seen in the anteromedial
aspect of the valve. 6. There is no pericardial effusion.
UE U/S [**5-26**]:Ultrasound evaluation of the left upper extremity
deep venous system using grayscale, color, pulse wave Doppler
reveals the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary,
brachial, basilic veins to be fully compressible with normal
Doppler waveforms, augmentation, and respiratory variation in
flow. The left cephalic vein is not compressible with
hyperechogenic within the lumen consistent with thrombosis.
CXR [**5-27**]: The right internal jugular catheter was withdrawn in
meantime interval. The pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium
and right ventricle, unchanged. The heart size is markedly
enlarged but stable. There is worsening of the left lower lobe
and right lower lobe atelectasis. Right pleural effusion is
small to moderate. Left pleural effusion cannot be assessed due
to the fact that the left costophrenic angle was not included in
the field of view. There is slight worsening of the perihilar
haziness and upper zone pulmonary vasculature redistribution
suggesting mild pulmonary edema. The distended azygos vein
contributes to the diagnosis suggesting for overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14410**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission he
was brought to the operating room where he underwent Coronary
Artery Bypass Graft x 2, Asc. Aorta Replacement, and Mitral
Valve Replacement. Please see operative report for details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Over the next two days he
remained intubated secondary to hemodynamic instability
requiring multiple Inotropes. on post-op day two he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He
required aggressive pulmonary toilet via multiple inhalers and
diuresis. He was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On
post-op day four he underwent a bronchoscopy for left lung
atelectasis and a mucous plug was removed. Gram stain from
bronchoscopy revealed gram negative rods and antibiotics were
started. On post-op day five he was transfused one unit pRBC.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. Despite aggressive pulmonary toilet, diuresis for CHF
and antibiotics for pneumonia, patient was having worsening
shortness of breath on post-op day six and eventually had
respiratory decompensation that required re-intubation. He was
eventually weaned from sedation on post-op day eight and
extubated without incident. On post-op day nine he underwent an
upper ext. U/S which revealed a thrombosis of the left cephalic
vein. He began ambulating well with PT and on post-op day ten he
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. Over
the next two days there were no further complications. On
post-op day eleven he required a PICC line placement d/t poor
venous access. He continued to work with physical therapy for
strength and mobility. He appeared stable on post-op day twelve,
but still required additional physical therapy. He was therefore
discharged to rehab facility with the appropriate follow-up
appointments and medications.Prior to d/c a UA was sent after
UOP cloudy. Results were negative for UTI.
