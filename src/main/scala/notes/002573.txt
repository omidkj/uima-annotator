EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  84 year old male with
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, HTN, history of angina who
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital complaining on light headedness,
diaphoresis and presyncope and dizziness on the day of
admission. No reports of chest pain.  Had seen his PCP one week
prior for low HR, unknown details. Stopped taking all of his
medications a week ago for a few days because he wasn't feeling
well per his son but then restarted.

At OSH, his EKG showed wide complex tachycardia with right
bundle branch block.  His systolic blood pressures were
hypotensive to systolic blood pressures in the 70's. He was
given approximately 4L of iv fluids.  He was intubated for
unclear reasons although likely airway protection, sedated with
versed drip and started on dopamine.  He was given 10mg iv
vitamin K and aspirin 325mg po x 1.  He was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was continued on versed drip and Cardiology was
consulted.  Electrophysiology looked at patient's EKG:
Irregular, HR 60's-140's, varying between right and left bundle
branch block. At baseline, EKG with right bundle branch block.


On review of symptoms, he was intubated and sedated and unable
to answer questions. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

*** Cardiac review of systems was unable to be obtained
secondary to intubation/sedation.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 74063**] is an 84 year old male with AFib on
coumadin, HTN who presnted to OSH with lightheadedness,
presyncope and tachy-brady episodes.

# Rhythm - On admission, the patient's rhythm was as follows:
tachy-brady, occasional pauses 1.5 sec, underlying right bundle
with intermittent left bundle and bigeminy with runs of VTach.
The patient arrived to the unit intubated and while the patient
was still sedated, a transesophegal echocardiogram was performed
to evaluate for thrombus in the setting of chronic afib and
rhythm abnormalities.  No thrombus was appreciated and the
patient then underwent synchronized cardioversion with 200J in
syn mode.  The patient was converted into normal sinus rhthymn.
However, the patient continued to have runs of ventricular
tachycardia that were mildly symptomatic.  These episodes
responded to a lidocaine drip and a temporary pacing wire was
placed on [**2119-8-18**].  The patient was also loaded with a
beta-blocker in an attempt to control the tachyarrythmia.
However, the patient not only had episodes of ventricular
tachycardia but also had episodes of bradycardia which made the
dosing of the beta blocker difficult.  Electrophysiology testing
was performed on [**2119-8-21**] but revealed a trigger fascicular
ventricular tachycardia which is not amenable to VT ablation.
Therefore, on [**2119-8-22**], a dual device pacemaker was placed with
leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.  It is hoped that
the pacemaker will control the patient's bradycardia so that a
theraputic dose of beta blocker can be given.  On [**2119-8-23**], the
patient's metorolol was titrated up to 37.5mg PO TID.  The
pacemaker was interogated on [**2119-8-23**] and found to be working
properly.  PA and lateral chest films confirmed the pacemaker's
lead placement in the right atrium and right venticle.  The
patient continued on 48 hours of antibiotics due to the
pacemakder placement and will be followed in the device clinic
on [**2119-9-1**] at 10:30am.

# Pump -  On admission, the patient appeared volume overloaded
with bibasilar crackles and bilateral infiltrates and pleural
effusions on chest x-ray.  The patient was diuresed with prn
lasix.  An echocardiogram done on [**2119-8-18**] showed: EF 35% Global
and regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w diffuse process. There
was moderate mitral regurgitation.  The patient was discharged
on standing lasix due to  poor left ventricular systolic
function.

#)CAD-Cardiac enzymes were cycled and an acute coronary process
was ruled out.  The patient does report a past history of chest
pain and the echocardiogram did show regional left ventricular
wall motion abnormalities suggestive of a past infarct.
Therefore, the patient was started on an ACEinhibitor.  The beta
blocker was also continued.  Additionally, it is recommended
that the patient recieve a chemical stress test to evaluate for
CAD as an outpatient.

#)Anticoagulation:  Heparin drip was initially started because
patient received Vitamin K at the OSH.  Additionally, the
coumadin was held due to the temparary pacing wire placement,
electrophysiology study, and pacemaker placement.  The patient
was anticoagulated with a heparin drip, and Coumadin restarted.
On [**2119-8-23**], the patient was on coumadin 5mg PO Dialy with an INR
of 1.4.  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to have the
INR checked.

# HTN - Initially, the patient was hypotensive. The B-blocker
and ACE inhibitor titrated to blood pressure.  It is recommended
that these continue to be titrated up as tolerated as an
outpatient.

# Metabolic Acidosis: On admission, a Gap acidosis was suggested
by labs and ABG.  However, the acidosis resolve
