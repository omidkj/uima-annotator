Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
mild mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2107-8-29**] at
1300 hours.

Post bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving a infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Aorta is intact
post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**8-29**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 (left internal mammary
artery->left anterior descending artery/Saphenous vein grafted
to Obtuse Marginal/Posterior descending artery) with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
Cross clamp time= 47 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=59
minutes. Please see Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for further
details. He was intubated and  sedated when transferred to the
CVICU in critical but stable condition. He awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without difficulty.   Chest tubes and
lines were removed on the first day after surgery and beta
blockade and diuretics were begun.  He continued to progress and
he was transferred to the step down unit for continued care.
Physical therapy consulted and evaluated him for mobility and
strengthening as he progressed. The remainder of his
postoperative course was essentially uneventful. On POD# four he
was cleared for discharge to home. All follow up appointments
were advised.
