PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness (mostly from prior note and OMR,
including sign out from MICU):
Mr. [**Known lastname 4300**] is a 49 year old diabetic with CHF (20-30% in [**2097**])
who presented with SOB on [**2101-3-14**]. SOB was worse over the last 3
days prior to admission, present both at rest and with exertion.
It began subacutely. He sleeps on 2 pillows chronically,
recently has had to sleep more upright. He does endorse PND. He
says he has been taking all of his medications at home, though
he is not sure of all of the names. He does not watch his sodium
intake carefully, but says that his diet hasn't really changed
recently. Denies any CP or palpitations. Pt also notes RLE
erythema with some associated pain over the last several days
prior to admission. He has had a mild productive cough with
green phlegm and rhinitis no fevers/chills/sweats.
.
In the ER, vitals were 97.4 83 157/100 22 93% (?on RA).
Admission labs notable for BNP of 2595. EKG showed RBBB, new
from [**2098**]. CXR poor quality but without clear infiltrate. RLE
lenis were negative for clot. ER did not want to do CTA given
report of shellfish allergy and felt VQ would not be feasible
given habitus. He was given 1g vancomycin for ?RLE cellulitis
and levofloxacin 750mg. Also received carvedilol 12.5mg, lasix
80mg PO, KCL 20meq, nitro SL, and furosemide 40mg IV. ER course
notable for hypertension up to 201/128. Vitals prior to transfer
afebrile 83 177/117 20 92% on 3L


Past Medical History:
* CHF/dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 20-30% on last TTE [**2097-3-30**].
Trivial MR, [**2-5**] TR and moderate pulmonary hypertension
* Type 2 DM,
* Hypercholesterolemia
* Morbid obesity
* Crack abuse
* OSA (new diagnosis)


Social History:
Lives with his mother. Is on disability. Most recent crack use 3
weeks prior. Formerly smoked cigarettes. Drinks 40oz beer
occasionally. Denies any IVDA of any kind. Reports prior
negative HIV test but says he thinks "he's due for another"

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2101-3-23**] WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2101-3-25**]) - from RLE draining
cellulitis
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         This isolate is presumed to be resistant to clindamycin
based on
         the detection of inducible resistance .

IMAGING/STUDIES:
TTE [**2101-3-16**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR for 57cm RUE PICC placement [**2101-3-19**]: There has been interval
placement of a right-sided PICC, which on initial film
demonstrated coiling in the supraclavicular region and
terminated within the mid SVC. Subsequently, this was advanced
with tip at the cavoatrial region, in good position.
There is severely limited inspiration. Cardiopericardial
silhouette is not
well assessed. Focal airspace consolidation is evident. No
evidence of
pneumothorax.
.
Bilateral LE Ultrasound [**2101-3-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of DVT.
2. Prominent inguinal lymph nodes, likely hyperplastic.
.
Inpatient Bedside Sleep study [**2101-3-25**]:
RESPIRATORY EVENTS: ETCO2 measurements varied between 41-47cm
throughout the course of the night while on PAP. NV mask alone
was used and no EERS was added. BIPAP SV Auto pressures of EEP
10
PS min 5 PS max 10 to BIPAP SV Auto EPAP 12 PS min 7 PS max 13
with 4L O2 to 6L O2 was titrated throught the course of the
night. The entire night was spent in the supine position. In
supine NREM BIPAP Auto SV pressures of EPAP 12 PS min 5 PS max
10
with 4L O2 resulted in sats greater than 91% with occasional
flow
limitation and occasional microarousals. In supine REM higher
pressures were clearly needed. In supine REM BIPAP SV auto
pressures of EPAP 12 PS min 7 PS max 13 and 6L O2 resulted in
sats 88% and occasional respiratory events but while in NREM
sats
stayed at 95% or greater. There was no evidence of periodic
breathing with the addition of NV mask.
ASSESSMENT: The patient must avoid supine sleep. BIPAP Auto SV
EPAP 12 PS min 7 PS max of 13 with 6L O2 results in very good
control of SDB in supine NREM and acceptable control in supine
REM. There was no evidence of periodic breathing, albeit with
the
aid of a NV mask, on tonights PSG. Continued efforts must be
made
towards weight loss. A formal outpatient split night study will
be performed to identify optimal settings upon discharge from
the
hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Dyspnea / Hypoxia / CAP - Etiology presumed to be
multifactorial including an acute decompensation of his chronic
heart failure, a possible viral URI, underlying pulmonary HTN in
setting of uncontrolled OSA, as well as compressive atelectasis
secondary to body habitus. CXR on admission was without evidence
of pneumonia; noted to have some hilar fullness in a very
limited study due to body habitus. LENIs negative for DVT, BNP
2595. (no prior). Cardiac enzymes remained negative, however
Repeat ECHO showed persistant EF 25% (unchanged from prior). PE
was also considered b
