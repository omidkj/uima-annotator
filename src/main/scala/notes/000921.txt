Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: pain control, [**First Name3 (LF) **] hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right IJ CVL placement
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
71 y.o. female with left tib/fib fracture recently admitted to
MICU Green for pain control in the setting of hypotension
necessitating Dopamine, later found to have an Enterobacter UTI
treated with Meropenem and subsequently called out to the floor
upon resolution of hypotension who is now being transferred back
for an acute change in mental status.
.
Patient had been doing well after being called out until
yesterday when she triggered for being nonresponsive. Of note,
she had gotten Dilaudid in the AM for pain control and had
undergone regularly scheduled dialysis with no complications. At
the time of the acute change in mental status, a head CT was
performed which was normal. An ABG was also performed -
7.37/53/71 (previous ABGs dating back as far as [**2176**] have shown
normal CO2 values). She became more responsive after the ABG was
performed, interacting appropriately and responding to verbal
stimuli, however her mental status continued to wax and wane and
a MICU evaluation was requested.
.
In the ED, vitals were notable for a RR of 10 during most of the
day, but otherwise vitals were stable. She was awake, alert and
oriented to person and place. She correctly identified the
month, but not the date or year. She was able to follow simple
commands. Asterixis was noted on exam, despite taking Lactulose,
recently increased from 30 mL TID to QID and Rifaximin. Given
underlying acid-base disturbance in the setting of mental status
changes, she was transferred to the ICU for further management.

.
In the MICU, she continued to be hypotensive, CTA negative for
PE, Urine + enterococcus and started on Meropenem. Mental status
improved once agreed to take Lactulose. She also failed her [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stim so was started on steroids. Her BP stabilized and she was
off pressors and back to the floor. BP was stable during second
ICU admission. She did have a hct drop (see below) but heme/onc
felt this was not hemolysis and there was no active bleeding but
hemoccult + stools.
.
Currently, patient reports some leg pain at fracture site but
otherwise feeling well. She denies f/c, no dizzyness, no
dysphagia, no chest pain, no SOB, no cough, no [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain, [**Last Name (un) 103**]
girth slightly increased, no dysuria, no hematuria. She has
loose stool with copper tinge, no melena, no nausea/vomiting.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: sinus brady, rate 50, left anterior fasc block, RBBB
pattern, QTc 535, TW flattening diffusely, no other ST-T
changes. c/w prior.
.
CXR: Stable right pleural effusion and a lower lobe opacity
which may
reflect effusion/atelectasis
.
Pelvis and ankle: no fracture
.
Left Leg: Acute fracture involving the proximal tibia and fibula
metaphysis with approximately 6 mm medial displacement of the
distal fracture fragment
.
RUQ U/S
Note is made that this is a difficult study due to the patient's
body habitus. The liver has a coarse echotexture appearance, but
there are no lesions identified. There is no biliary dilatation
and the common duct measures 0.5 cm. There is a partially
shadowing echogenic structure within the gallbladder, which
appears to be sludge with developing gallstone. There is no
ascites identified. The spleen was not identified on this exam.
.
CXR: There has been removal of right IJ central venous catheter.
A right PICC is seen with its tip terminating in the mid
subclavian vein. There is interval resolution of pulmonary
congestion and improvement in right pleural effusion which is
now small-to-moderate. Right lower lung opacities persist likely
representing atelectasis. Streaky atelectasis persists in the
left mid and lower lung. Otherwise no new pulmonary infiltrates
are identified. The heart size remains enlarged. No pneumothorax
is identified.
