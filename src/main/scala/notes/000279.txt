History of Present Illness:
This 57 year old male wastransferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] after
cardiac catherization revealed double vessel disease. He
initially presented there on [**7-22**] with a nonhealing infection of
a left toe. During his hospitalization he underwent amputation
of the left middle toe on [**2142-7-25**]. He developed two episodes of
new rest chest pain with EKG changes of transient ST elevations
in AVR, V1, V2. Chest pain resolved on its own and enzymes were
negative. These episodes occurred on [**7-22**] and [**7-25**], with no
chest pain in the past 3 days. Cardiac catheterization was
performed on[**7-27**] and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today for
cardiac surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-7-30**] Vein mapping: Patent left greater and short saphenous
vein with diameters amenable for bypass conduit
[**2142-7-30**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40%
stenosis.
[**2142-8-6**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
mitral annular calcification as well as calcification of both
subvalvular apparati. There is non-flow restricting chordal [**Male First Name (un) **]
but no valvular [**Male First Name (un) **]. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. POSTBYPASS: The patient is
A-paced and is on a phenylephrine infusion. Left ventricular
function remains normal. Mild aortic regurgitation persists.
Trivial mitral regurgitation persists. Aortic contours are
normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
He received medical management while undergoing extensive
pre-operative work-up, including lab work, carotid ultrasound,
vein mapping and a vascular surgical consult. On [**7-31**] he was
brought to Operating Room by vascular surgery for serial
arteriogram of the left lower extremity and balloon angioplasty
of the proximal peroneal artery. Please see operative note for
details. Following the case he was transferred back to floor for
further medical care.

On [**8-6**] he was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass graft x 3 was undertaken. Please see
operative report for surgical details. He tolerated the
procedure well and was extubated easily.  The wound vac remained
on the left toe amputation site.  He was begun on beta blockers
and then Cardizem was initiated after Amiodarone failed to
control his atrial fibrillation.  He converted to sinus rhythm
and Coumadin was resumed for the paroxysmal fibrillation and his
peripheral vascular disease.

He was below his properative weight at discharge but there
remained a moderate asmount of right stump edema which precluded
the prosthesis from fitting. A stump shrinker was therfor
utilized.  The toe amputaion site was clean with a wound vac in
place. he will be followed by his vascular surgeon Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]
after discharge.

He was stable and ready for discharge to rehabilitaion on POD 5.
 medicationsd were as listed as was follow up.
