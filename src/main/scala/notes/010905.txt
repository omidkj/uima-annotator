HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2128-11-14**].  On the day of
admission Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] performed a valve sparing aortic
root replacement.  The patient had 199 minutes on bypass, 179
minutes cross clamp time and 10 minutes of circulatory
arrest.  Please see previously dictated operative note for
more details.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged
from the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit.
On leaving the operating room the patient was intubated, was
atrial paced and on a Propofol drip.  Her postoperative
course was complicated by hypertension in the Intensive Care
Unit which required her to be on a variety of vasoactive
drips.  On postoperative day #1 she was on Esmolol, Nitro and
Propofol drip to maintain her blood pressure.  By
postoperative day #2 the patient was weaned off all
vasoactive drips and was extubated and pressure was
controlled with oral cardizem.  She was transferred to the
patient care floor on postoperative day #2.  By postoperative
day #3 her pacing wires and Foley catheter were removed and
she was ambulating at approximately level [**2-7**].  The patient
continued to do well and had a temperature up to 101.2 on
[**11-25**].  Fever was worked up with CBC, urinalysis, blood
cultures, urine cultures and sputum cultures.  Her work-up
did not reveal any source of the fever, neither did a chest
x-ray.  Her fever resolved and she remained afebrile
throughout the duration of the hospital course.  The patient
continued to do well and discharge was delayed until
postoperative day #7 due to the fact that she was to be
discharged home alone.  Her discharge was delayed until she
had support at home.

pressure 112/68, respirations 18, 96% on room air.  General
