History of Present Illness:
80 y.o. woman w/ pmh CAD s/p CABG, DM, presenting from [**Hospital **]
rehab with fever and shortness of breath.  Per the patient's
daughter, and  staff at [**Hospital **] rehab, the patient has had one
week of fevers and altered mental status.  Her altered mental
status coincided with the initiation of baclofen and dilaudid
one week ago.  She only received one dose and this has been
discontinued. Per daughter, the patient was quite somnolent on
the dilaudid and did not return to her normal mental status
until this past wednesday.  On [**3-8**] her oxygen saturation at
[**Hospital **] rehab was 80% on RA, and increased to 90% on 3L.  She was
therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  On presentation to the
emergency room her vitals were 100.8, 101, 163/73, 18, 99% 3L.
EKG showed 1mm ST depressions in V4-V5. BNP was 4995.  CXR
showed multifocal pneumonia.  The patient was started on
azithromycin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. She wa
salso given hydromorphone 1mg IV X1.  While in the ED she became
progressively more tachypneic, with respiratory rate as high as
30, and she was therefore admitted to the ICU.
.
On review of symptoms, the patient reports chronic left
arm/shoulder muscle spasms which also cause headaches. She also
reports orthopnea, which has been worsening over the past two
weeks. She denies PND. She reports diminished appetite.  She
denies abdominal pain, hematochezia or melena, or dysuria. She
reports right hip pain worse with movement.  she is able to
ambulate with a walker.  She denies dysphagia.

RADIOLOGY AND OTHER STUDIES:
=============================
CXR [**2122-3-8**]
CONCLUSION: New diffuse, confluent alveolar opacities throughout
both lungs. The appearances are highly concerning for a
multifocal pneumonia, possibly with superimposed edema

CXR [**2122-3-10**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-8**] and 23.
Involvement of the lower lungs and diffuse infiltrative
abnormality has
progressed, upper lobe involvement remains more severe, some of
the
abnormality is probably edema but whether the initial insult was
asymmetric
edema or pneumonia depended on patient positioning at the time,
as described in the report. Heart size normal. No pneumothorax

CT Chest [**2122-3-12**]:
The study was obtained during the expiratory cycle of
intubation. Within the limitations of this study technique,
airways appear to be patent with no endobronchial obstruction
demonstrated. The lungs are extensively and
diffusely involved by areas of ground-glass opacity with septal
thickening and small foci of consolidation. These findings have
been gradually progressing since [**2122-3-8**] chest
radiograph and mostly new compared to [**2-6**]. The
radiological appearance is consistent with diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage. Differential diagnosis might include pulmonary edema
(given the presence of pleural effusion and known cardiac
history). Infection is less likely given the diffuse character
of the findings and mostly ground-glass rather than
consolidative pattern. The ARDS might be considered in
differential diagnosis, although the presence of pleural
effusions is against that entity.
There are no bone lesions worrisome for malignanc

EKG [**2122-3-8**]: NSR rate 100, normal axis, normal PR, QRS interval,
No LVH, ST depressions in V4-V5 under 1mm, compared to baseline.

CHEST CT [**2122-3-12**]: The lungs are extensively and diffusely
involved by areas of ground-glass opacity with septal thickening
and small foci of consolidation. These findings have been
gradually progressing since [**2122-3-8**] chest radiograph
and mostly new compared to [**2-6**]. The radiological appearance is consistent with diffuse
alveolar hemorrhage. Differential diagnosis might include
pulmonary edema (given the presence of pleural effusion and
known cardiac history). Infection is less likely given the
diffuse character of the findings and mostly ground-glass rather
than consolidative pattern. The ARDS might be considered in
differential diagnosis, although the presence of pleural
effusions is against that entity.

CXR [**2122-3-18**]: There is gradual slow improvement in the widespread
parenchymal consolidations between [**3-13**] and [**2122-3-17**]
with significant relatively [**Name2 (NI) **] and prominent improvement
between [**2122-3-17**] and current chest radiograph which
suggests resolution of underlying pulmonary edema. There are
still present widespread opacities more of interstitial pattern
on the current study. There is no interval increase in pleural
effusion. The NG tube tip is in the stomach.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 y.o. woman presenting with fever, hypoxia, and dyspnea, with
CXR worrisome for multicfocal pneumonia.

#.Hypoxia: On presentation the patient had bilateral infiltrats
on chest radiograph presumed to be consistent with multifocal
pneumonia.  She also had an elevated BNP suggesting some degree
of pulmonary edema.  She was initially started on vancomycin,
pipercillin-tazobactam, and azithromycin for coverage of HAP (as
she came from a [**Hospital1 1501**]).  On the morning of the 24th after
presentation she became acutely more hypoxic and subjectively
dyspneic with worsening of her bilateral infiltrate pattern.
This was interpreted as likely flash pulmonary edema so she was
treated with NTG, furosemide, and rate control with BB with some
improvement though she remained dyspneic. Echo showed diastolic
failure but no significant systolic dysfunction.  She was
diuresed for two liters of volume loss with improvement in her
peripheral edema but when she again became acutely short of
breath that evening repeat CXR showed no interval improvement in
her infiltrates.  She then required intubation on the 25th for
persistent hypoxia and tiring.  She also had a BAL, which
demonstrated diffuse alvelolar hemmorhage.  Multiple auto-immune
labs were sent for concern of an auto-immune or vasculitic
etiology
