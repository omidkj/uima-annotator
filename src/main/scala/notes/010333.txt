78 yo M w hx of CAD, s/p cabg, COPD, AAA s/p repair at [**Hospital1 18**],
reports waking at 3am with BRBPR. He went back to sleep and was
awoken once again with BRBPR. he therefore drove to the OSH ED,

his systolic blood pressures ranged in the mid 80-90s. he had
five episodes of BRBPR in the ED. Patient was given 1 unit of
platelets and 3L of NS. he was sent urgently to IR for
embolization where he continued with 300cc BRBPR en route to IR.

Unfortunately angiography was unable to visualize the [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and
they were therefore unable to visualize any bleeding source. he
was given 2 units of prbcs with decrease in hct from 36 to 30.
He was then given one more unit of prbcs with increase of hct 30
to 37. he was transferred to the MICU with close surgery and GI
follow-up, and initial plan to undergo colonoscopy in the
morning. If this is unsuccessful surgery will consider segmental

MESSENTERIC ([**5-12**]): CTA abd from outside hospital showed extrav
into left colon coming off [**Female First Name (un) 899**] distribution. Our angio done [**5-12**]
showed no filling of [**Female First Name (un) 899**]. SMAgram showed collateral supply to
left colon (arc of Riolan) however no active extravasation.
Attempt made to get into this arc, however it was extremely
tortous and unable to advance catheter.

CXR ([**5-12**]): Some opacification at the base of the left lung could
be due to mild edema, but there is no appreciable pleural
effusion, cardiomegaly or any widening of the upper mediastinum
to suggest vascular engorgement. Moderate hiatus hernia is
present.
