Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleuritic chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63 year old man with recent diagnosis of widely metastatic
undifferentiated adenocarcinoma, likely of the lung, transferred
from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for further workup and to consider possible
initiation of palliative chemo or radiation. Patient presented
to OSH [**9-10**] after worsening substernal chest pain since [**Month (only) 205**]. He
first noted the pain after moving TV's, and he assumed it was
musculoskeletal. The pain was continuous, and exacerbated by
breathing and laying flat, and began radiating along the right
and left thorax. He also developed right shoulder pain and low
back pain during this time. Additionally, he has noted
increasing shortness of breath over the last few months and
developed an occasionally productive cough. He denies recent
fevers or chills and has not noted any weight loss. Denies
headache, changes in vision, or focal numbness or weakness.
Denies pain in hi calves. No nausea or vomiting, although his
appetite has been poor as of late. He denies bowel or bladder
incontinence. Review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.

At OSH, an abnomral CXR led to CTA of the chest which showed
likely malignancy and metastatic disease including extensive
mediasitnal hilar LAD, rt chest wall soft tissue mass with bony
destruction of the adjacent right anteriorr second and third
rib, left posteriror chest wasll soft tissue mass with bony
destruction of the left posterior 8th rib, and mutliple
pathologic rib fractures. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed
multiple metastatic lesions within the liver, right adrenal
gland, left gluteal muscles, right groin, and a pathologic L1
vertebral body fracture with soft tissue impressing upon the
thecal sac. Biopsy of the rib lesion was attempted, but failed
due to patietn's inability to lie flat. Similarly, MRI of the
head could not be obtained due to inability to lie flat. Biopsy
of the gluteal lesion was obtained which preliminary report
showed undifferentiated adenocarcinoma. Of note, patient was
also treated empirically for PNA with levaquin and steroid
taper.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung: The patient was admitted to
the ICU and was evaluated by oncology, radiation oncology and
palliative care.  With his poor performace status and advanced
disease, palliative radiation alone was offered to the patient.
Palliative care made recommendations for pain management with
plan to go home with hospice.  The patient was agreeable to the
plan.  He received one dose of radiation on [**9-20**] and was
discharged home with hospice services.

# Hypoxia: thought [**1-12**] possible pna with underlying copd and
splinting from pain of bony lesions.  He was treated initially
at the osh with steroids and levaquin.  The abx completed on
[**9-18**] and the steroid taper was continued on discharge.  He will
also go home with supplemental O2 and nebulizer treatments.

# Hypercalcemia: Initial Ca was 10.9 on admission.  He was
hydrated and given one dose of pamidronate.  Repeat calcium
level was 9.0.
