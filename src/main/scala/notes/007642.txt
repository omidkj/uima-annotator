Pertinent Results:
[**2145-9-15**] - ECHO
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST Grafting
Biventricular systoliuc function remains normal. The study is
otherwise unchanged from pregrafting. LVEF > 55%

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2145-9-13**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner. The renal, orthopedic and [**Last Name (un) **]
diabetes services were consulted for assistance in his care as
they had been following him previously. On [**2145-9-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was taken to the operating room where he underwent off-pump
coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels(Left internal
mammary artery grafted to Left anterior descending
artery/Saphenous vein grafted to Diag 1/Diag 2). Please see
Dr[**Doctor Last Name 14333**] operative note for further details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in
stable but critical condition. He awoke neurologically intact
but remained intubated due to hypoxia and acidosis. POD#2 his
pulmonary issues had improved, with continued aggressive
pulmonary hygiene and he was ready to extubate without
difficulty. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely
fashion. Beta-Blocker, statin, and aspirin initiated. All
preoperative consulting groups resumed following postop.
Mr.[**Known lastname **] continued to progress. POD#3 he was transferred to
the step down unit for further monitoring. Physical therapy was
consulted and evaluated his strength and mobility progression.
The remainder of his postoperative course was essentially
uneventful. He continued to progress and Physical therapy
cleared him for discharge to home, with recommendations to
continue use of his oxygen as needed with ambulating. Mr.[**Known lastname **]
has oxygen already set up at home, due to his continued use at
night for obstructive sleep apnea, in which he does not use
CPAP. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] cleared Mr.[**Name14 (STitle) 51788**] for discharge to home
today, with VNA. All follow up appointments were advised.
