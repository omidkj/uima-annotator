Neuro: CN 2-12 intact, 5/5 strength, A&O x 3

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**6-25**]: Limited study due to poor enhancement of the
pulmonary artery. Massive filling defeat in bilateral main
pulmonary arteries, representing bilateral central PE, probably
extending to segmental branches of bilateral upper and lower
lobes, however, segmental branches are not fully evaluated.
Small right pleural effusion. Opacity in right upper and lower
lobes, which may be due to infartion, however, other processes
such as pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. Opacity in
right upper lobe is somewhat rounded and measures 2 cm.
Echo [**6-25**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is markedly [**Month/Year (2) 6878**] with severe hypokinesis of the basal
2/3rds of the free wall. The apex is dynamic ([**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign).
Valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] is suggested, but an outflow tract gradient was not
assessed. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. Mitral
regurgitation is present (?mild-moderate) but cannot be fully
quantified. Compared with the study of [**2163-6-7**] (images
reviewed), the right ventricular cavity dilation and systolic
dysfunction are new and c/w acute pulmonary process (e.g.,
pulmonary embolism). Tha mitral valve repair has been performed
and the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced.
Abd CT [**6-27**]: Thrombus identified within the distal IVC,
measuring upwards of 5-6cm in length. 2. Peripheral-based
opacities in the right lower lung, consistent with atelectasis,
although possibly representing infarct if patient has known clot
on the right side.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED with
increased dyspnea on exertion since his minimally invasive
mitral valve repair on [**2163-6-7**]. He underwent a chest CT which
showed a "massive" bicentral pulmonary embolism. He was
immediately started on anticoagulation (Heparin, Coumadin) and
admitted to the Cardiac surgery ICU. TPA was not indicated
secondary to bleeding risk from recent surgery. He also
underwent an Echo which appeared consistent with an acute
pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism). Subsequently had a
bilateral lower extremity U/S which was negative for DVT. He had
a Hematology consult and HIT panel on hospital day two. HIT
panel came back positive on hospital day three and Argatroban
was started (Heparin stopped). Platelet count decreased 3
straight days to a low of 58 and then trended back upwards after
Heparin was stopped and while on Argatroban. He was transferred
to the cardiac surgery telemetry floor and later on this day an
Abdominal/Pelvic CT was performed which revealed a large
thrombus in the distal IVC. On hospital day four Vascular
surgery was consulted and brought patient to the catheterization
lab and placed a IVC filter proximal to the thrombus. He then
returned to the cardiac surgery step down floor. Over hospital
course he remained on Coumadin and it was titrated for a goal
INR of 2.5-3.5. Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained stable over the next
several days. Argatroban was stopped prior to discharge and he
was discharged with a platelet count of 111K on [**6-30**] and an INR
of 3.3 on [**7-2**]. His Coumadin will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12816**]. He
was discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate
follow-up appointments on hospital day #8. Hypercoagulability
workup recommended as oupt. with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12816**]. First blood draw
on Monday [**7-4**] with VNA with results to be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12816**].
