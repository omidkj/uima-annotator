words and not being able to move the left side of her body. They
immediately called EMS who brought her here. Of note, patient
has a history of colonic AVM that has led her to several
hospitalizations due to GI bleed. In [**2175**] she developed atrial
fibrillation and was started on coumadin by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2450**]. As
another gastrointestinal hemorrhage occured one year
ago([**2176-12-31**]), it was decided to stop coumadin.

left side of the room and she made a few mistakes when I tested
touching one or two arms and asking how many arms I was
touching. with some evidence of left sided neglect.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 75 year old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation off Coumadin given history of GI bleeds related to
colonic AVM, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented
after being found down with left hemiparesis and decreased level
of consciousness. Physical exam on admission was significant for
being awake but somnolent, dysarthria, left sided neglect, left
hemiparesis, and upgoing toe on the left. CT Head showed an
acute right MCA territorial infarct. Given her somnolence and
size of her right MCA infarct with potential to swell, she was
admitted to the NeuroICU. She was continued on an ASA 325 mg
daily, and her blood pressure was allowed to auto-regulate (and
ranged 130-180 overnight). MRI/MRA brain/neck performed at
approximately [**9-3**] pm on the day of admission ([**1-1**]) showed acute
right MCA infarct with no hemorrhage or shift of midline
structure and decreased flow in the right ICA and complete
occlusion of the right MCA
at its M1 segment. The patient's GCS began to decrease at
approximately 3 am on Day 2 of admission ([**1-2**]), with decreased
responsiveness. This was initially thought to be due to her
respiratory status. At 4:40 am, she was reevaluated by neurology
and found to have a fixed and dilated R pupil at 6 mm, no
corneal reflex on the right, and no gag. Repeat Head CT at 5:19
am showed showed new hemorrhagic conversion within the
extensive, virtual-complete right MCA territorial infarction,
which, along with worsening cytotoxic edema, caused
significantly increased mass effect, with severe leftward
subfalcine and right uncal and impending downward transtentorial
herniation. She was thought to have a malignant MCA infarct due
to recanalization and reperfusion causing hemorrhage. She was
intubated and given Mannitol 20% 150 g IV x1. Her son was
notified, and neurosurgery was consulted who performed an
emergent right hemicraniectomy on the morning of [**1-2**]. She was
hypotensive during the hemicraniectomy requiring pressors. A
repeat head CT/CTA after the hemicraniectomy showed continued
midline shift and increased size of the hemorrhage. She was
started on Dilantin after the procedure, and her ASA was
discontinued. A family meeting was held with the patient's son
(who was present) and daughter (via the telephone), and they
were informed about the patient's grim prognosis. The patient's
daughter wanted to continue care until she was able to come to
[**Location (un) 86**] from [**State 3908**]. The patient was started on Mannitol IV q6
hr.
The patient was made CMO after family meeting and expired a few
hours later.
