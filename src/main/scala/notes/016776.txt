Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12131**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath/Fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pleurex drain placement by interventional pulmonology


History of Present Illness:
patient is a 44yoF with congenital developmental delay who
presented to OSH with fevers, shortness of breath, weight gain,
and lower extremity swelling for several weeks.  Patient's
parents noted lower extremity swelling, left greater than right
for last several months.  Presented to her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 1 week PTP
who felt she may have heart failure and started empiric diuresis
(patient is adverse to testing and becomes very anxious)
Started on 40 mg PO lasix daily at that time with moderate
improvement in her LE swelling. .  Regarding her fevers,
temperatures reported to be in the 101 region intermittingly for
about last 2 weeks.  Additionally having sore throat, copious
rhinorrhea, dry cough, which per report appeared to improve.
Three days PTP however became febrile again.  per patient's
family, she has had no changes in baseline mental status, and
has not had any vomiting, chest pain, abd pain, diarrhea, or
dysuria although patient is a poor historian. No sick contacts.
.
At the OSH found to be hypoxic at 89-92%.  Improved on 5L NC and
treated empirically with Lasix and Levofloxaicn.  OSH xray
showed diffuse underlying interstitial lung disease, a new large
L pleural effusion, small R pleural effusion, mild congestive
failure, LLL consolidation, ?RLL consolidation as well. CT chest
at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] showed interstitial edema, LLL collapse, b/l
pleural effusions, and small pericardial effusion. The patient
was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
.
In the ED, patient was afebrile satting 97% on 5L.  She was
given Vancomycin 1gm IV for possible pneumonia and was admitted
to the MICU for possible thoracentesis and further management.
.
In the ICU, patient was diuresed with 20 mg IV lasix.
Thoracentesis was considered but deferred given patients
stability and anticipated difficulty for performing
thoracentesis in this patient with mental retardation.  Her
vitals remained stabily in the high 90's/low 100's.  She
continued to saturate in the 90-95% range on 2L NC.  She was
diuresed for a total volume of 720 cc's negative.  BP's ran in
the high 90's/low 100's systolic (her baseline).  An ECHO was
performed which failed to show evidence of heart failure (EF
55%), but did confirm trivial pericardial effussion as well as
possible small PFO.
.
On call out to the floor patient was afebrile, HR of 101, BP
98/51, RR 26-33, satting 95% on 2L NC.
.

IMAGING:
[**8-18**] TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. A few microbubbles are seen in the left heart very late
after intravenous injection c/w transpulmonic passage (small PFO
cannot be fully excluded, but less likely). The estimated right
atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Very
prominent bilateral pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Prominent bilateteral pleural effusion.
.
[**8-19**] BILATERAL LENIS: Grayscale, color, and pulse Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging was performed of the bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, peroneal and posterior
tibial veins. Normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation was
demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: No DVT
