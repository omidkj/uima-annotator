Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical venillation
Central Venous Line placement
PICC line placement
Arterial catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
85 y/o M with hx of DM, CHF, dementia and sacral ulcers was
transferred from his nursing home to the [**Hospital 56335**] Hospital by
request of his daughter for decreased consciousness and
decreased BP.
.
Initial vitals at OSH were 100.4, P 65, R 44, 94% on NRB, 88/55.
 He was intubated in the ED and went into afib with RVR and
dropped his BP, so dilt gtt was started as well as peripheral
dopamine.  He was noted to have a K of 7.3, was treated with
CaCl, NS IVFs, and kayexcelate.  He was presumed to be septic
secondary to his low grade fever, hx of sepsis and high lactate.
 He was given a total of 4L NS and cefepime 1gm and levofloxacin
750 mg.  A Femoral CVL was placed.  Family requested transfer to
[**Location (un) 86**].
.
He was transported via ambulance on propofol 20 mg IV prn,
dopmaine 40 mg/kg/min, and cardizem 10 mg/hr.  He was intubated
and sedated, thus there was no more history available.

TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient being on a
ventilator. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricle is not well seen. No pathologic valvular
abnormality seen.

CXR:
1. Bibasilar air space opacities, could represent pneumonia.
2. Additional opacity in the left infrahilar region, could
represent
additional focus of infection. Attention is recommended to this
region on
follow up studies to assess for resolution.
3. Endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.

CT Torso:
. Left basal effusion and scattered ground-glass opacities in
both lungs
with more confluent focal opacities in the lower lobes are
highly suggestive
of areas of infection and pneumonic consolidation. Please ensure
follow-up to
clearance.

2. Bilateral renal lesions, some of which are likely simple
cysts but others
are more dense and a mass cannot be excluded. A dedicated renal
ultrasound
would help clarify further.

3. Distended gallbladder, without evidence of wall thickening or

pericholecystic fluid or inflammatory change.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 y/o M with hx of CHF, DM, sacral decubs, afib and dementia
who presented with pneumonia and septic shock including altered
mental status and hypotension,  complicated by afib with RVR
during presentation.

#. Respiratory failure and pneumonia: Initially intubated and
admitted to the MICU where he was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics and vasopressors. Weaned from the vent and extubated
without incident.  Was ruled out for flu.  Blood pressure
normalized and was weened of pressors. Antibiotics continued for
HAP and complicated by aspiration.  Received 14d course
vancomycin and cefepime and 6 days of Flagyl.  Respiratory
status was complicated by a component of volume overload and
received several doses of IV lasix with good results, which was
continued for a daily dose of 40mg PO Lasix.  This medication is
new and may need to be decreased or stopped in the future when
back to dry weight.  Also with underlying COPD, which likely
further reduced respiratory function.  Since arrival to the
floor respiratory status has been stable on NC, intermittantly
with some decreased saturations that improved with deep
suctioning.  Tube feeds were also adjusted for a lower volume so
that aspiration risk is minimized and Hyoscyamine was started to
decrease secreations.  Patient is unable to tolerate anything by
mouth.

# Afib with RVR: In MICU with heart rates in the 190s with drop
in BPs. Started on a diltiazem drip  and eventually hemodynamics
normalized. Likely exacerbated with dopamine used as initial
pressor. Transitioned to levophed with improvement. After
weening of vasopressors, restarted on home metoprolol amd
amiodarone doses with good effect.  On day of discharge,
metoprolol was decreased from QID to TID for HR in the 60s.  On
coumadin for anticoagulation with INR 1.9-2.1.  Dose adjusted t
