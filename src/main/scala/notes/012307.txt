Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**]
Chief Complaint:
"my legs are swollen" x 2 weeks.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open Splenectomy [**2167-7-14**]

History of Present Illness:
37M with h/o HIV/AIDS (last CD4 12, VL 7000) with chronic
medical issues related to AIDS including diarrhea, sinusitis,
pancyotpenia, chronic fevers that are unchanged. Essentially, Mr
[**Known lastname 26240**] has experienced (chronic) BLE edema that has progressed
to a point where he was referred for inpatient management.
Recent w/u in [**Month (only) 116**] included Echo and LENIs that were
unremarkable; he was discharged on lasix to control anasarca. He
states that lasix is not as  effective as it used to be (160
Qam and 80 Qpm).  Pt relates that his ankles and area behind the
knees are sore and making ambulation difficult; this is related
only to this acute event.  He states that when he stands, he can
almost feel the fluid rush to his feet.  He has no orthopnea,
new SOB, CP, PND.  Last echo in [**4-9**] with EF >55%, no diastolic
dysfxn.  Received 120 IV lasix on arrival to floor with prompt
diuresis > 700 cc.workup demonstrated no evidence of CHF or
venous occlusion.  He was finally d/c to home w/ lasix to
control his anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26240**] is a gentleman who expired on the surgical service
on [**2167-7-24**] of respiratory failure secondary to acute renal
failure and complications from advanced AIDS status-post open
splenectomy on [**2167-7-14**]. He was initially on the medical service
prior to his surgery. A brief summary of his hospital course is
follows:

Mr [**Known lastname 26240**] was admitted on [**2167-6-15**] for inpatient management of
his anasarca, chronic diarrhea, and chronic pancytopenia.

With regards to his HIV, his last CD4 12, viral load 7000.
Treated w/ HAART, home meds continued (abacavir, lamivudine,
zidovudine, enfuvirtide, ritonavir, dapsone for pcp [**Name9 (PRE) **],
famciclovir, fluconazole).

With regards to his anasarca, this was postulated to be
secondary to low oncotic pressure secondary to chronic
pancytopenia as well as lymphatic insufficiency. Albumin level
was checked several times, however, and was > 3, leading us to
consider a multi-factorial etiology for the edema. CT abdomen
was done to assess for retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as a
source of venous occlusion, but it was negative.  Echo on this
hospitalization revealed no significant change from the previous
study in [**4-9**], with EF >55%.  Edema was managed initially with
high-dose lasix, and then with metolazone.  Diuretics caused
only marginal improvement in LE edema, and caused the patient to
be hypovolemic and hyponatremic.  Diuretics were discontinued
and patient was placed in compression stockings.

With regards to his diarrhea, the patient was found to have C.
diff positive stools and was started on a course of Flagyl for
treatment.

From an infectious disease standpoint, intermittent and chronic
low-grade fevers gave way to frank fever spikes on day 3 of
hospitalization, along with development of R ear pain and a
coincidentally positive sputum for AFB that was taken as an
outpatient. Cultures of nose and ear revealed GPC in pairs from
the sinus and pseudomonas from the ear. MRI ordered to assess
extent of pseudomonal infection (see below) indicated diffuse
(R>L) meningeal enhancement c/w menigitis. He was maintained on
several courses of empiric antibiotics, as well as IV acyclovir
possible HSV lesion in his ear.  IV acyclovir course completed
prior to viral culture results. He developed acute R ear pain
with serosanguinous drainage early in this hospitalization, and
ENT was promptly consulted for input. ENT input regarding
mastoiditis indicates that no surgical intervention required
even if pt were appropriate candidate.  He had one sputum
positive for AFB on [**2167-6-9**]. He was placed on resppiratory
precautions until 3 sets of negative sputums were obtained (no
sputum samples from this hospitalization have been positive).
He was treated empiracally for presumed MAC.

With regards this his pancytpoenia , this was postulated to be
initially to be secondary to his  HIV marrow suppression. Recent
BM biopsy from [**5-10**] showed hypocellularity w/ no marrow
infection, though cultures had never been sent.  Patient
experienced steady decline in cellular counts which prompted
reevaluation of initial hypothesis and data. Marrow showed viral
inclusion bodies (though there was no evidence of viral
organsims), and therefore, serologies for CMV and Parvovirus B19
were sent.  He was treated with IVIG 1g/kg/day to treat possible
parvovirus and intiated on Procrit, 40,000 u/week.  Surgery was
consulted and due to his severe thrombocytopenia, the decision
was made to procede with salvage splenectomy.

He underwent splenectomy via open technique on [**2167-7-14**] (please
see the operative note of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for full details).
Post-operatively, he initially did well and was extubated and
transferred out of the ICU by post-op day 3 and started on a
clear liquid diet. However, he began to have oliguric renal
failure and was transferred back to the ICU for close
monitoring. Within a day his renal failure became anuric and he
presented with an encephalopathic picture. Renal consultation
assessed the patient's renal failure as multifactorial in
nature, including HIV nephropathy, renal failure secondary to
amicar treatment for his MAC, and perioperative fluid changes.
He was emergently intubated for mental status changes
comprimising respiration. He was dialyzed for 4 consecutive
