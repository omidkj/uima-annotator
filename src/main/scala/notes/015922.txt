[**2129-3-25**] TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent
foramen ovale is present with a left-to-right shunt by color
Doppler at rest. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] with normal free wall contractility. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and descending aorta
to 40 cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is mild mitral valve prolapse. There is a large vegetation on
the mitral valve involving both leaflets (predominantly A3/P3)
and measuring 2.3 x 1.0 cm. There is partial flail of the
posterior leaflet. No mitral valve abscess is seen. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
tricuspid, pulmonic valve or aortic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Large vegetation on the mitral valve with moderate
eccentric mitral regurgitation and partial flail of the
posterior leaflet.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo M with h/o HTN, depression, several fractures [**10-6**], C
Diff, recent MSSA endocarditis and urinary retention w/ bladder
stones who comes in with AMS, [**1-31**] enterococcus endocarditis.

# [**Name (NI) 79985**] Pt initially had high grade bacteremia with 8/8
bottles from blood cultures in first two hospital days positive
for enterococcus.  Proven with veg on MV on [**3-25**] TEE. ID was
consulted. Pt was placed on vanco/gent and PICC line was placed
for antibiotics. On [**3-29**] pt had another blood cx positive for
Enterococus. His sensitivites returned sensitive to
ampicillin/penicillin, and pt had pcn desensitizaiton, which he
tolerated well. Pt was started on Pcn G/Gent combination
therapy. The sensitivities for the new cx on [**3-29**] showeed
resistence to Vancomycin but the patient had already been
changed to Pcn/Gent. The culture from the 31st also returned as
resistant to Gentamycin. So his antiboitic regimen was changed
again to Ampicillin 2g IV q4h, and Strepomycin 650mg IM q24. The
cultures continued to remain negative for the remaining time
during this admission (for 6 days). Pt should get weekly BMP
checked and Gent troughs. If pt's Cr rises a gent Peak should
also be checked.  These labs should be faxed over to the Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 191**] clinic. The fax number is ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 16691**]. Pt also
had a streptomycin peak and trough drawn prior to discharge and
this should be followed as outpt.

# Mitral Valve failure- Pt has 2+ regirg w/ mild MVP and partial
failure of post leaflet. No abscess seen on echo. Pt still needs
to d/w family whether to pursue surgery. CT [**Doctor First Name **] saw the patient
and first noted that pt's antibiotic course would need to be
finished if any procedure was to be done, but in their opinion
pt did not need surgery. Pt did not have any mitral valve
abscess, new heart failure, nor complete failure of the valve.
So at this point pt does not need surgery. Pt should have a
repeat echo in 6 weeks.

# Altered mental status- Pts altered mental status was thought
to be [**1-31**] infection and several recent changes in his
psychiatric medications. Pts infection was treated as above and
all psychiatric medications were held.

# Depression - pt has severe depression and was on 3
antidepressants when he came. These were held due to his AMS
