Endoscopy with variceal banding x4


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 yo F w/ past medical history of autoimmune
hepatitis, cirrhosis, known grade II varices who was admitted
for hematemesis and was found to have a variceal bleed. She
reports being in her usual state of health until the day prior
to admission. She reports feeling bloated and nausead that
evening with a sense of fullness. She became increasingly
nauseated over the course of the night and at around 4am she
went to the bathroom to vomit. As she was running to the
bathroom she bumped into the door, hit her head and fell. She
then vomited a large amount of bright red blood with dark clots.
She called EMS and was sent to [**Hospital3 3765**]. There, she was
found to have a Hct of 29.4. She also had a head laceration from
hitting her head on the bathroom door which was cleaned and
dressed. She received NS 2L IV as well as Zofran 4mg IV for
nausea. A CT head was negative per report, though there is
currently no documentation in her transfer paperwork. She was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management. Of note, she
takes low dose prednisone for AI hepatitis as well as a PPI. She
has no history of GIB.
.
In the ED, her vital signs were T 98.2, BP 121/49, HR 62, 97% on
room air. She was given pantoprazole 40 mg IV x1 and octreotide
100 mg IV x1. She was hemodynamically stable throughout her ED
stay. Her HCT here was down to 26.9 after IVF. She was
transferred to the MICU for further management.
.
In the MICU she was started on Octreotide 50 mcg/hr IV DRIP,
Sucralfate 1 gm PO TID, and CeftriaXONE 1 g IV Q24H x3 days and
continued on Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H. She underwent EGD which
found 4 cords of grade II varices in the middle third of the
esophagus and lower third of the esophagus. The varices were not
bleeding and all were banded. Her HCT remained stable overnight
and she was transfered to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**] for further
management.
.
At this time, she denies any melena, BRBPR, diarrhea, abdominal

EGD [**2153-2-2**]: Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade II
varices were seen in the middle third of the esophagus and lower
third of the esophagus. The varices were not bleeding. 4 bands
were successfully placed. Stomach: Contents: Small amount of
clotted blood was seen in the stomach body. Mucosa: Patchy
erythema of the mucosa was noted in the antrum and stomach body.
These findings are compatible with mild gastritis. Duodenum:
Normal duodenum. Impression: Varices at the middle third of the
esophagus and lower third of the esophagus (ligation) Erythema
in the antrum and stomach body compatible with mild gastritis
Blood in the stomach body Otherwise normal EGD to second part of
the duodenum Recommendations: No definitive source of bleeding
found; bleeding presumed secondary to varices. Continue
octreotide drip. Ceftriaxone 1 g qd
.
EGD [**2152-11-10**]: 2 cords of grade II and 3 cords of grade I varices
were seen in the lower third of the esophagus. The varices were
not bleeding. Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance of the
mucosa were noted in the whole stomach. These findings are
compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy. A probabale
small non bleeding varix were seen in the cardia.
.
EKG: Sinus, rate of 63, normal axis and intervals, TWI in V1 and
TWF in V2, no ischemic changes. No priors for comparison
