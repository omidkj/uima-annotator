ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COUSRE:  The patient was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on [**3-6**] of [**2106**] and remained in
stable condition.  He was continued on Zosyn for presumptive
pneumonia and remained afebrile.  His white blood cells
counts also went down to 10 on the day prior to discharge.
He had no signs of active infection on the day of discharge.
Given his cardiac arrest on presentation he also had been
evaluated by the Electric Physiology Consult Service in the
hospital.  It was thought that his initial cardiac arrest was
most likely secondary to pulmonary causes.  Since the initial
stress was most likely sinus bradycardia.  He had a repeat
echocardiogram on the day prior to his discharge.  The full
reports will follow.  The left atrium is normal in size.  The
right atrium is moderately dilated.  A small secundum, atrial
septal defect is present.  There is mild symmetrical left
ventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size is
normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed, ejection fraction estimated to be 345
to 40%.  Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
septal inferolateral and inferior hypokinesis.  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.  The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.  1+ aortic regurgitation is seen.  Mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened, 1+ mitral regurgitation is
seen.  There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion.  He also
went for EP study on the day prior to his discharge, which
showed only 9% polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
Therefore there is no indication for defibrillator placement.
 Given his persistently high blood pressure in the hospital
antihypertensive medication had been titrated up.  He was
discharged on Metoprolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Lisinopril 20 mg po
q day and Norvasc 5 mg po q day for blood pressure control.
Since he suffered acute renal failure on presentation it is
important to follow his creatinine level until it returns to
normal.  On the day prior to discharge his creatinine level
was down to 1.8.  During this hospital stay his creatinine
level was up to 2.5 on [**3-3**].

The day prior to discharge the patient also complained of
frequent bowel movements, however, C-diff was still pending
on the day of discharge.  Since the patient is also on
multiple laxatives it would be wise to hold the bowel regimen
while the patient has diarrhea.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post cardiac arrest.
2.  Status post intubation.
3.  Pneumonia.
4.  Urinary tract infection.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Diabetes.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Augmentin 500/125 po b.i.d. for four
more days for a total of a ten day course, Metoprolol 50 mg
po b.i.d. held for systolic blood pressure less then 100 and
heart rate less then 55.  Lisinopril 20 mg po q day held for
systolic blood pressure less then 100.  Norvasc 5 mg po q day
hold for systolic blood pressure less then 100.  Aspirin 325
mg po q day, Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. held for bowel movements
greater then twice a day, Dulcolax 10 mg po q day hold for
bowel movement greater then twice a day.  Protonix 40 mg po q
day, regular insulin sliding scale.  Tylenol prn, Albuterol
inhaler prn.

DIET:  Diabetic and cardiac healthy diet.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
congestive heart failure clinic on [**3-29**] of [**2106**] at 10:00
a.m.  The patient will also follow up at the [**Hospital 191**] clinic in
one month.  The patient will call for an appointment.  The
phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**] was given.  Other follow up
instructions the rehab facility was asked to check the BUN
and creatinine level and titrate up blood pressure medication
as needed for a goal systolic blood pressure 120 to 130.  The
patient's daily weight and ins and outs should also be
followed up closely.  Po daily Lasix may be needed if the
patient appeared to be fluid overloaded.  The patient's
previous oral hypoglycemics may also be restarted once the
renal function improved.
