Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67 year old female
severe steroid dependence, home oxygen dependent chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, who
had a colonoscopy performed on [**3-7**], at an outside
hospital for the second part of the large 4 to 5 cm polyp
removal by colonoscopy.  The patient was not an operative
candidate due to her underlying cardiopulmonary disease and
this was the second operation to remove the large polyp in
question when seen at an earlier date.  She was observed over
night at the hospital and discharged on [**3-9**].  She was to
be seen the following day after discharge for bleeding at
home, however, was stable there and discharged again.  She
had a second episode again after her second admission at the
outside hospital for a large amount of hematochezia, and
presented herself to [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Department where she had another large episode of
bright red blood per rectum.  She denied having any abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, back pain, fevers, chills, difficulty
breathing or chest pain.  Actually her breathing was at her
baseline severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status.
Her initial hematocrit in the Emergency Department was 37.8,
however, she was in some mild acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 1.2 which after intravenous fluids and
normalization of her creatinine decreased to 30 to 31 range
later in the hospital course where it remained constant
throughout her hospitalization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Previous medical history includes - 1.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 3 liters of
cannula oxygen at rest, 4 liters/minute activating on chronic
Prednisone therapy for at least two months.  2.  Congestive
heart failure, unknown etiology, no coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.  4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  5.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus felt to be related to steroid use.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy.  7.  Status post right knee
surgery.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Losartan 50 mg b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 60 mg b.i.d.
3.  Spironolactone 25 mg b.i.d.
4.  [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel 30 mg b.i.d.
5.  Combivent, Advair, Flovent inhalers
6.  Singular 10 q.h.s.
7.  Prednisone 20 mg q.o.d. and 10 mg q.o.d., alternating
days.
8.  Nortriptyline 25 mg h.s.
9.  Paxil 10 mg h.s.
10. Clonazepam 0.25 mg t.i.d.
11. Numerous Vitamins
12. Pantoprazole
13. Insulin sliding scale.

ALLERGIES:  She states she is allergic to numerous
medications, however, after chart review with her primary
care nurse practitioner, the only documented allergies we
could find were rashes with Bactrim, Ceftin and Keflex.  She
had reported myalgias with fluoroquinolones but there is no
report of any rash or difficulty breathing associated with
that class of medication.  She has had reported shortness of
breath with Tetracycline, however, no rash, and has reported
that she has tolerated Macrolides in her chart despite giving
a history of rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient no longer smokes, however, has
an extensive smoking history and is now home oxygen
dependent.  She lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 5450**],
[**State 350**].  She denies frequent alcohol use or illicit
drugs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Medicine Intensive
Care Unit with a baseline hematocrit of 38 prior to
resuscitation of her hypovolemic status where she was
tachycardiac in the Emergency Department, however, never
hypotensive.  Upon intravenous fluid replacement, her
creatinine decreased.  Her tachycardia resolved and her
hematocrit decreased, ranging between 30 to 33, where it
remained stable throughout her hospital course.  She never
required transfusion during her hospital stay.  After being
observed in the Medicine Intensive Care Unit and not having
any further bright red bowel movements, she was transferred
to the floor.  She had three small dark maroon stools without
associated decreases in her hematocrit or abdominal pain that
was felt to be residual blood from her proximal large bowel
lesion.  The Gastroenterology Service followed the patient
closely throughout her course and the plan was made for
colonoscopy.

On hospital day #5, however, the patient had brown, clear,
rectal affluent and had no blood.  Given this fact, her
stable hematocrit, and the lack of having fresh bleeding
since admission to the hospital in the Emergency Department,
the decision was made to forego colonoscopy and have the
patient discharged with close follow up.  The patient
understands that if she should have any recurrence of bright
red blood per rectum that she should immediately return to
the Emergency Department via ambulance as there is the
potential for rapid rebleeding should the surgical site where
her mass was resected start to bleed again.

This was discussed with her nurse practitioner and she has an
appointment on Monday with her at Dr.[**Name (NI) 49335**] office for
repeat hematocrit check.  Throughout her hospital stay she
had no associated problems related to her chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  She was maintained on her home level of
oxygen as well as continued on her chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease medications including her steroids and she
had no associated dyspnea or orthopnea with it from her
congestive heart failure.  She does continue to be limited by
her inability to walk distances greater than 20 feet due to
dyspnea, but this is stable per the patient.  She will be
discharged on hospital day #5 with the following diagnosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed, status post 4 cm mass
excision in the proximal colon via colonoscopy seven days
ago.
2.  Anemia due to bleeding, hematocrit stable for several
days now.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stable, continue
on her home oxygen and Prednisone.
4.  Acute renal failure, upon admission, resolved with
intravenous rehydration.
5.  Congestive heart failure which has been stable throughout
her hospital course.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease, has been stable on
Protonix.

She will follow up with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 20932**] on Monday, for hematocrit check and she will also
follow up with the [**Hospital 6283**] Clinic in one to two
weeks where she will return to the Emergency Department if
she has any further bleeding or other problems.
