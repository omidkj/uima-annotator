Service:

This is a 36-year-old male with a history of refractory gamma
delta T-cell hepatosplenic lymphoma, status post splenectomy
[**2185-11-27**], status post Cytoxan, last dose [**2186-6-23**], status
post Campath last dose [**2186-6-27**], who presented today to
hematology/oncology clinic for routine Campath.  Subsequently
developed two hours of progressive tachypnea and shortness of
breath.  Initial vital signs were T-axillary of 100, blood
pressure 110/70, heart rate 140, respirations 40, saturating
100% on non-rebreather.  The patient was admitted for further
management of his metabolic acidosis.

Past medical history - diagnosed with the T-cell lymphoma in
[**9-28**], status post CHOP with Pentostatin and Cytoxan; SIADH
secondary to Cytoxan; renal tubular acidosis secondary to
chemotherapy; history of VRE, even matched BMT candidate.

Allergies - no known drug allergies.

Medications - prednisone 60 mg q.a.m. and 20 mg q.p.m.,
Famvir 50 mg t.i.d., Levaquin 500 mg q.day, Bactrim double
strength three times a week, Lasix 20 mg b.i.d., Diflucan 200
mg p.o. q.day, Ativan one h.s., Oxycodone 5 mg q4 to 6
p.r.n., Tylenol p.r.n., Benadryl p.r.n.

Social history - lives with his wife [**Name (NI) 803**] and their
young son.  His wife is his health care proxy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.8, heart rate 137,
blood pressure 113/48, respirations 38, 100% saturation on
non-re-breather.  In general the patient was alert, using
accessory muscles to breathe, in moderate respiratory
distress.  HEENT - oropharynx was clear without thrush.
Lungs had minimal rales at the bases.  Cardiovascular - the
patient was tachycardia, but regular.  Abdomen positive for
hepatomegaly, multiple erythematous patches on his abdomen,
soft, nontender with moderate distension, normal active bowel
sounds.  Extremities with 3+ bilateral pitting edema to his
knees.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was found to be in severe
metabolic acidosis, DIC and acute renal failure.  He was
initially treated for neutropenic fever with broad spectrum
antibiotics, Vancomycin.  His DIC was supported with blood
products including packed red blood cells, FFP and
cryoglobulin and GCSF.  It was later determined that his
severe metabolic acidosis was likely secondary to aggressive
tumor.  He was given chemotherapy in the form of Pentostatin
and steroids.  He was also dialyzed in an effort to support
his metabolic acidosis, also treated with non-invasive mask
ventilation to help his respiratory status for his severe
metabolic acidosis.  Despite these aggressive measures the
patient's clinical course continued to deteriorate and the
patient was eventually made DNR and DNI and comfort measures
only.  The patient died at 3:30 p.m. on [**2186-7-4**].
