Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoclygemica

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year old female with a history of insulin-dependant
diabetes who presents for recurrent hypoglycemia.

She has a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart
failure, and recurrent urinary tract infections.

Her coronary artery disease dates back to an ST elevation MI in
[**2167-11-28**], for which she had stents placed in the LAD, with
ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25% for which she had an ICD
placed.

She presents to the ED because she was noted to be more obtunded
at [**Hospital3 537**].  Her fasting sugar was 25.  EMS arrived, gave
thiamine and D50.  In the ED, repeat sugar was 160 however Ms
[**Known lastname **] was still obtunded.  Her family describes that she had
a similar mental status the day prior, with a low blood sugar.
Upon repeat blood sugar check in the ED, her sugar was again 25.
 She was started on a D5 drip and admitted to the MICU for
recurrent hypoglycemia, with concern for over-administration of
insulin at [**Hospital3 537**]. She was also noted to be hypothermic
with temperatures of 94.5.  A bair hugger was applied at
transfer.  Review of systems otherwise negative.

PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ([**2169-4-9**]): A single-lead AICD device is
unchanged in position along the left hemithorax with lead
extending into the right ventricle.  Bilateral low lung volumes
are noted.  Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by low lung
volumes.  Bilateral predominantly interstial edema is noted.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Additionally there
is silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm with dense
consolidation overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral
view raising concern for left lung base pneumonia.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild interstitial edema.
2. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Left basilar confluent opacity, concerning for focal
pneumonia in the
appropriate clinical setting.

PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ([**2169-4-11**]): Patient's condition required
examination in sitting upright position using AP frontal and
left lateral views. Comparison is made with a preceding similar
examination dated [**2169-4-9**]. Cardiac enlargement as before.
Unchanged appearance of previously described permanent pacer in
left anterior axillary position connected to ICD cable
terminating in right ventricle. Comparison of the frontal views
demonstrates that the previously present moderately distended
pulmonary vasculature has regressed and also the evidence of
some fluid in the minor fissure has disappeared. As before,
there
is still some evidence of small amounts of pleural effusion
accumulating in the posterior pleural sinuses, but there is no
evidence of any discrete local pneumonic infiltrate suggesting
that new aspiration pneumonia has occurred. Review of several
previous chest examinations during [**2167**] shows that the patient
has had episodes of CHF with interstitial edema on the bases and
some pleural effusion before.
IMPRESSION:  Improvement of pulmonary congestive pattern during
the latest examination interval.  No progression of acute
pulmonary infiltrates that would suggest major aspiration
pneumonitis.
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2169-4-9**]): Portions of the study are
degraded by motion artifact. Within this limitation: There is no
evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, discrete masses, mass
effect or shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles
and sulci appear mildly prominent consistent with age-related
involutional changes. Periventricular and subcortical
low-attenuation white matter changes appear consistent with
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. A few mastoid
air cells appear non-pneumatized, right greater than left.
Bilateral visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. The visualized
orbits are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial
hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
