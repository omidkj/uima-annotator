Radiology:
[**2-4**] CT torso w/o contrast: Patchy tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the
right upper lobe. There are more dense mixed consolidative and
ground glass opacities in the lower lobes and within the right
middle lobe. Trace pleural effusions. There are multiple
prominent but relatively small mediastinal lymph nodes up to 7
mm in shortest dimension. Mild prominence of the central hepatic
bile ducts without definite intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. The extrahepatic common duct measures up to 6 mm.
The gallbladder is massively distended, measuring up to 13 cm in
length. There is no definite surrounding inflammatory change,
however, and no radiopaque stones are visualized. Particularly
without intravenous contrast administration, further evaluation,
however, is highly limited. The pancreatic head is poorly
visualized but appears perhaps slightly enlarged and may have a
double duct sign raising at least the suspicion of an underlying
mass. The spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
Particularly the right kidney is highly atrophic, but there is
also left renal cortical thinning. There are vascular
calcifications noted but no aortic aneurysm. There is extensive
involvement of the left ischium with Paget's disease and lesser
involvement of the left ilium. The bones are diffusely
demineralization. There is leftward convex scoliosis of the
lumbar spine with degenerative changes, including intervertebral
disc space narrowing and osteophytes throughout the lumbar
spine, extending from the T11-T12 through the L5-S1 interspaces.
There are posterior osteophytes from the level of T12- L1
through L3-L4.

[**2-4**] CT head w/o contrast: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus. There
are periventricular white matter hypodensities most consistent
with chronic microvascular ischemic changes. There are small
lacunes within the right cerebellar hemisphere. There is an
air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus with adjacent
mucosal thickening. This fluid is of high density and could
represent inspissated secretions vs. blood. No facial fractures
are identified on these limited images.

[**2-4**] CXR: : Bibasilar opacities concerning for pneumonia. Right
lung base atelectasis. No congestive heart failure. No pleural
effusion.

[**2-4**] CT C spine: No acute fractures or dislocations. Multilevel
degenerative changes with at least moderate spinal canal
narrowing at C4-5 due to osteophytes and a central disc
protrusion.

[**2-5**] U/S: : Dilated gallbladder with stones in its lumen. No
ericholecystic fluid, gallbladder wall thickening, or
son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign. Intra- or extra-hepatic biliary
ductal dilation. The pancreas and pancreatic duct are not well
assessed.

[**2-10**] CXR: Moderate right and small-to-moderate left pleural
effusions are unchanged. Bibasilar consolidation is present and
slightly worse on the left in the interval. Multifocal poorly
defined upper lobe opacities have slightly worsened and likely
correspond to areas of bronchocentric opacification on recent CT
torso. The constellation of findings is most consistent with a
multifocal infection.

[**2-10**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right
atrial pressure is  11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. At least mild aortic valve stenosis is
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Significant aortic valve stenosis - ?mild. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular  systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Bilateral
pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female presents with GI bleed in setting of elevated
INR and hypothermia/hypotension, found to have a multilobar
aspiration pneumonia..

1) GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: This was most likely an
upper source, given melena, in the setting of markedly elevated
INR 22. She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit,
where her INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K. The
gastroenterology service was consulted, but the patient and her
health care proxy declined further work-up (EGD/colonoscopy). At
time of discharge, her hematocrit was stable at 34.5. She was
maintained off coumadin.

2) Sepsis due to aspiration pneumonia: In the ICU, the patient
was fluid resuscitated and covered with Zosyn/vancomycin with
stabilization of blood pressure. She had a speech and swallow
evaluation, which recommended soft diet/thin liquids with no
mixed consistencies. At time of discharge, she was on oxygen for
comfort, 100% 2L NC. She was transitioned to oral
