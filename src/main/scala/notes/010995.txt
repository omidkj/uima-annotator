[**2195-5-4**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Incarcerated left inguinal hernia with multiple dilated bowel
loops within the hernia sac.
2. Bilateral adrenal nodules, incompletely assessed. Recommend
further
evaluation with non-emergent MRI.
3. Multiple bilateral probable renal cysts, some of which too
small to fully characterize

[**2195-5-5**] Head CT :
No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23**] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the
Emergency Room and based on his physical exam and Abdominal CT
urgent surgery was recommended. Due to his other co morbidities
he underwent medical clearance from Pulmonology and Geriatric
Medicine prior to going to the Operating Room.

On [**2195-5-5**] he was taken to the Operating Room and underwent an
exploration of the left inguinal hernia with a small bowel
resection and closure of the hernia defect.  He tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the SICU in stable condition. He
maintained stable hemodynamics and was eventually extubated.
Postoperatively he had problems with profound delirium which
reportedly happened with previous hospitalizations.  A Head CT
was done to assure there was no acute pathology and it was
essentially normal.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor his mental status
remained about the same.  He knew his name but otherwise
perseverated and had periods of agitation.  The Geriatric team
had consulted early on during his hospital stay and were
re-consulted again with this acute delirium. They felt that he
may have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 309**] Body dementia and recommended treatment with
Ativan as opposed to Haldol.  His narcotics were minimized and
eventually he improved. Currently he is awake, oriented to self,
cooperative and without any episodes of agitation.

Due to difficult venous access a PICC line was placed in the
Right basilic vein on [**2195-5-7**].  This was strictly for IV access
and can be removed once it is no longer needed.

His diet was advanced on post op day #3 and he remained free of
nausea or vomiting.  His abdominal incision was noted with
erythema and mild induration, Keflex was started and ordered for
a total of 7 days.

Physical Therapy was consulted and have recommended a stay in a
short term rehab prior to returning home to increase his
mobility and endurance.
