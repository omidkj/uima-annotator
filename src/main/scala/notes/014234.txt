Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1384**]
Chief Complaint:
Hepatitis C
ETOH cirrhosis
dyspnea/cough/Right hydropneumothorax.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2104-11-30**] Orthotopic deceased donor liver [**Month/Day/Year **] (brain
dead donor), (piggyback) portal vein to portal vein
anastomosis, common bile duct anastomosis (no T-tube), common

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old male with hepatitis C and alcoholic
cirrhosis currently being evaluated for a liver [**Known lastname **], last
MELD was 24 on [**10-16**].  He initially presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**11-10**] with dyspnea and cough symptoms.  He recently underwent a
thoracentesis 2 weeks ago and has been feeling progressively
dysnic since that time.  He was sent to the ED where he was
hypoxic to 86% on RA with a new leukocytosis and worsening
hyponatremia.  He was admitted to the hepatology service at that
time.  He underwent a therapeutic thoracentesislast night for 3L
and became hypotensive to the 70s
postprocedure, responding to a 500cc fluid bolus.  A CXR did not
show a pneumothorax at that time.  This morning he was again
hypotensive with an increasing oxygen requirement.
Additionally, his hematocrit was noted to be 22, down from 28.
Given this hemodynamic instability and difficulty monitoring
volume status he was admitted to the SICU for closer monitoring.

The patient currently reports that his dyspnea is significantly
improved.  He denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness
ofbreath or dizziness. He does note worsening lower extremity
edema over the past several weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o male admitted through the ED following thoracentesis the
previous day. On [**11-11**] he was having acute on progressive SOB
following thoracentesis for 2.2L and hypotensive with SBP of 70.
A chest tube was placed [**11-12**] which immediately drained 2L then
continued to drain 2 more liters over the course of the day. He
remained hemodynamically stable and was transfused for low HCT
and given albumin to match large CT output.  On [**11-13**] a pigtail
catheter was placed in R chest. The chest tube output was
replaced with albumin and NS. He developed respiratory failure
necessitating intubation

On [**11-15**] he underwent bronch for worsening CXR with BAL sent.
Chest tube continued to have moderate output that was replaced
with IV fluid. BAL grew less than 1000 cfu's. He required blood
products for supra therapeutic INR. Octreotide drip for
hepatorenal syndrome was begun. Trophic tube feeds were
initiated. A head CT was done showing no acute intracranial
processes.

On [**11-19**] an MRI was done showing morphologic changes of cirrhosis
and portal hypertension without suspicious liver lesion or
vascular abnormality. A left replaced hepatic artery was noted
as an anatomic variant. Bilateral pleural effusions and right
lower lobe consolidation was seen consistent with pneumonia. He
was listed for liver [**Month/Day (4) **] after completing liver
[**Month/Day (4) **] evaluation. On [**2104-11-20**] a dialysis line was placed and
dialysis was initiated for worsening hepato-renal function.

Vanco, Zosyn and Micafungin were started to cover him broadly
despite negative pan-culturing. He continued to require blood
products and reversal of the INR/fibrinogen.

On [**2104-11-30**] a liver donor offer was available and accepted.  He
underwent orthotopic deceased donor liver [**Date Range **] (brain dead
donor), (piggyback) portal vein to portal vein anastomosis,
common bile duct anastomosis (no T-tube), common hepatic artery
(donor), common hepatic artery (recipient). Surgeon was Dr.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].  Refer to operative note for complete details.
Induction immunosuppression was administered. Intra op, he was
noted to have severe portal hypertension.  5 liters of
straw-colored bile stained ascites was removed. Liver was
markedly cirrhotic and enlarged. CVVH was continued during and
after the case. Postop, he was transferred back to the SICU
intubated but stable.

On [**12-1**],liver duplex showed patent vasculature. He was
transfused 2U pRBC for hct of 23.6 on [**12-2**]. A bronch was
performed for large amount of old blood and thick secretions
removed. Mental status significantly improved following the
bronch and on POD 3 he was able to be extubated, and CVVH was
stopped and intermittent hemodialysis was tolerated.

By POD 7 mental status worsened and a head CT was obtained which
was unremarkable. Repeat duplex liver U/S [**12-7**] showed patent
vasculature but an increase in the ascites.

On [**12-7**], he dropped his sats and blood pressure during HD.  He
was taken to IR for paracentesis and thoracentesis and was
transfused 2u PRBC for Hct 19.  On [**12-9**],  he was taken back to
the OR for exlap due to increasingly distended abdomen and
transfusion requirements. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. A
significant amount of blood and ascites was found. This was
washed out and no bleeding points were identified. He was
returned to the SICU intubated but stable. He was extubated the
following day.

Zosyn was stopped after a 17 day course and Flagyl was stopped
after 5 days. Micafungin was switched to routine fluconazole. He
passed a speech and swallow exam and started on thin liquids and
moist ground solids, but intake was insufficient for caloric
needs. Tube feedings continued throughout this hospitalization.

He was transferred to the [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] surgical floor 2 days
following the ex lap remaining on intermittent hemodialysis.
Nephrology followed him closely. He continued to be very
debilitated with flat affect.

LFTs were notable for slight elevation of AST and ALT. Alk phos
trended up into the 300 range. Bilirubin decreased as low as
2.1. Because of the lack of return to normal, a percutaneous
liver biopsy was performed on [**12-18**]. There were no
complications. The liver biopsy showed no evidence of rejection,
however th
