Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive urgency


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
37 y/oM with chronic type B dissection, uncontrolled HTN with
chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure admitted to
MICU with hypertensive urgency in the setting of medication
noncompliance.

The patient complained of worsening fatigue and symptoms of an
upper respiratory tract infection x 1 week with increasing
dyspnea x 36hrs.  His first episode of shortness of breath woke
him in the middle of the night.  He subsequently complained of
dyspnea on mild exertion.  + Intermittent nonproductive cough
with post-tussive emesis x 1.  + Increasing peripheral edema,
orthopnea and PND.  He denied any chest discomfort,
palpitations, fever, increased sputum production or other
complaints.  He does have a remote history of asthma but has not
needed an inhaler since childhood.  Of note, the patient has not
taken his home doses of amlodipine or HCTZ x 2 weeks because
"his prescription ran out and he was unable to go to the
pharmacy while it was open."

He initially presented to OSH with a BP [**Location (un) 1131**] of 207/127.  CXR
showed atelectasis vs infiltrate on L side and CT chest w/o
contrast without significant abnormality.  His dyspnea resolved
with oxygen therapy and he became asymptomatic.  He received his
home BP medications of labetolol 600mg, spironolactone 50mg,
amlodipine 10mg and ceftriaxone/ levaquin for a possible PNA.
Due to concern for expanding aortic dissection, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation.

On presentation to [**Hospital1 **], initial VS: 96.8 85 188/110 18 99%.
Vascular surgery consult recommended CTA to r/o increased
dissection but patient refused IV contrast.  After talking with
radiology, decided to pursue MRI which showed stability of type
B dissection with slight increase in size of thoracic aorta.
For hazy left lower lobe opacity, given levaquin 750mg.  For
management of HTN, patient received another dose of home blood
pressure medications including amlodipine 10mg, HCTZ 50mg ([**12-2**]
of home doses) and labetolol 600mg without significant effect.
He was subsequently started on a labetolol drip with BP
decreasing slightly.  As there was no acute surgical issue,
patient admitted to the medical ICU for further management.

OTHER RESULTS
===============
ECG [**2176-9-20**]:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. A-V conduction delay.
Left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific lateral ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-7-1**] atrial
ectopy is absent. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH [**2176-9-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Prominent, tortuous aorta again seen. Please note that the
patient is to
have an MRI to further evaluate his aorta.

MRI CHEST/ MEDIASTINUM W/O CONTRAST [**2176-9-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
Little overall change in the appearance of the known type A
dissection with
continued slight interval increase in size of the descending
thoracic aorta.

RENAL DOPPLER U/S [**2176-9-21**]:
IMPRESSION: Main renal arteries are patent bilaterally with
appropriate
waveforms.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 37 y.o. male with chronic type B dissection,
uncontrolled HTN with CKD, and CHF admitted to MICU with
hypertensive urgency in the setting of medication noncompliance.

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient presented with hypertensive
urgency presumed due to medication noncompliance.  He initially
required a labetalol drip to maintain SBP's under 180 but was
weaned off of it in the context of restarting his home
anti-hypertensive regimen.  Prior to discharge given persistent
mild hypertension to the 160's his labetalol was increased to
TID.

2. Aortic dissection: Initial concern on transfer was that the
patient's aneurysm could be expanding in the setting of
hypertensive urgency.  MRI imaging was not suggestive of this
and aneurysm remained stable.  He will resume his regular
surveillance regimen for this.

3. CKD: At presentation the patient's Cr was 2.7 but increased
to 3.3 prior to discharge.  Given benign ultrasound and fact
that baseline Cr has vacillated to above 3 in the past as well
as the fact the patient had close outpatient follow up this was
not considered a contraindication to discharge.

4. Dyspnea: The patient presented with subjective dyspnea
without any hypoxia.  Despite concern for infiltrate in the ED
given no leukocytosis and no other signs suggestive of pneumonia
antibiotics were stopped.  No EKG changes suggesting unlikely to
be due to coronary ischemia.  The patient's dyspnea was
ultimately thought most likely due to mild volume overload in
the context of hypertension and an increased afterload.  This
resolved by the day after admission and never recurred.

5. Eczema: The patient has severe eczema particularly on
extensor surfaces of his toes.  He was continued on his home
regimen of clobetasol and triamcinolone creams.

The patient tolerated a full diet.  He was full code.
