Date of Birth:   [**2074-5-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU GREEN

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old man
with type 2 diabetes complicated by end-stage renal disease
on hemodialysis, hypertension, and a number of chronic
medical problems listed separately who is transferred on the
date of admission from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital after
presenting with congestive heart failure.  The patient
reports that he was in declining state of health for
approximately one year.  He has had persistent problems with
peripheral edema, recurrent leg cellulitis, chronic debility.

On admission, he complained of shortness of breath.  Serial
markers ruled out myocardial infarction, however, the
patient's chest x-ray at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital was
consistent with congestive heart failure.  He underwent
successful diuresis with Lasix and Zaroxolyn losing
approximately 25 pounds over his hospital course.
Echocardiography revealed a preserved ejection fraction, mild
tricuspid and mitral regurgitation and an electrocardiogram
showed a left bundle branch block and an old myocardial
infarction.  Patient also completed a course of oxacillin for
lower extremity cellulitis.

The patient complained of nausea and vomiting for one month
prior to admission.  He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy
with biopsy which revealed proteinaceous infiltration of the
gastric submucosa suggestive, but not confirming amyloidosis.
Was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Type 2 diabetes complicated by end-stage renal disease.
2. Hypertension.
3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
4. Anemia secondary to renal failure.
5. Chronic lower extremity cellulitis.
6. Coronary artery disease, last cardiac catheterization was
in [**2142-12-25**] showing a 30% lesion in the right coronary
artery and a 30% lesion in the marginal branch in the left
anterior descending coronary artery.
7. Vitamin B12 deficiency.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Peripheral parenteral nutrition.
2. Lexapro 10 mg daily.
3. Prevacid 30 mg twice daily.
4. Metoclopramide 10 mg 4x daily.
5. Carafate 1 mg 3x daily.
6. Megace 400 mg twice daily.
7. Furosemide 100 mg daily.
8. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
9. Allopurinol 100 mg daily.
10. Multivitamin.
11. Erythropoietin.
12. Folate 1 mg daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is an accountant.  He does not
consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes.

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.0, heart rate 88, blood pressure
130/60, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.  Generally,
the patient was a depressed appearing man sitting comfortably
in no acute distress.  Examination of the head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat was unremarkable.  The heart examination
showed a regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, and a
systolic murmur.  Lungs had decreased breath sounds at the
bases.  Abdomen protuberant, soft, nontender, nondistended,
decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities showed no evidence of
edema or warmth.  Vascular examination showed intact
peripheral pulses.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  On presentation, the patient's white
blood cell count was 14.3, hematocrit 34.4, platelets of 396.
Chemistry panel is unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service initially.  Repeat hematocrit showed an acute drop in
his hematocrit to 25.1 attributed to bleeding after
esophagogastroduodenoscopy at the outside hospital.  He was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and received a blood
transfusion to restore his hematocrit to above 30.  The
patient had a long and complicated stay in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

1. Hypotension:  The patient was persistently hypotensive
upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit requiring
intermittent use of up to three pressors.  Attempts to wean
these medications were ultimately unsuccessful.

2. Respiratory:  The patient was electively intubated three
days after being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for airway protection, but was never extubated.  The
patient was treated with a 14 day course of meropenem for
ventilator-associated pneumonia.

3. Renal:  The patient was dialyzed as his chronic renal
failure progressed to end-stage renal disease on this
admission.  The uremia ultimately cleared, and the patient
was able to answer questions by nodding yes and no.  After
temporarily employing a femoral catheter as well as a
port-a-cath, the patient was ultimately dialyzed only with a
port-a-cath, however, the femoral line in addition to a right
subclavian line were found to be infected with Vancomycin
resistant Enterococcal species, ultimately identified as
ECCM.

The patient was then started on linazolid, however, his
platelet count started to drop.  He was switched from this
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] to Synercid in addition to persistent thrombocytopenia.
The patient also had a drop in his white blood cell count and
his hematocrit.  In addition, the patient had worsening
hypotension ultimately requiring dopamine, Neo-Synephrine,
and vasopressin.

4. Vascular:  While the patient initially presented with
resolution of a cellulitis, his toes became gangrenous.  In
addition, the patient had septic emboli in his fingertips.

On [**2144-2-25**], the patient's hypertension worsened, 3 mg
of atropine and 4 mg of Epinephrine were administered,
however, chest compressions were not performed as CPR was not
indicated for this patient.

The patient expired at 8:12 pm.  His wife, [**Name (NI) 35935**] and son,
[**Name (NI) **], were contact[**Name (NI) **].  They declined an autopsy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Enterococcal sepsis.
2. Anemia due to blood loss.
3. Multiple myeloma.
4. Type 2 diabetes complicated by end-stage renal disease.
5. Hypertension.
