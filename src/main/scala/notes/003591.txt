History of Present Illness:
78 year-old man with history of DM2, NASH/cirrhosis, known
esophogeal varices, and no prior GI bleeds presents with coffee
ground emesis. Per his son, he has been doing well and was in
his USOH until this morning when, after taking his medications
with some tomato juice, he had sudden onset of coffee-ground
emesis with dark blood. EMS was called and he was brought to the
ED. Upon arrival, initial VS were 98.5 115/52 85 20 98%RA and
had repeated episode of coffee-ground emesis. An NG lavage was
performed and after aspiration of coffee grounds and dark red
blood, his gastric contents cleared with 500cc NS. He was also
noted to have a melanotic bowel movement. He was started on an
octreotide and PPI drip and given 2L IVF and ciprofloxacin 400
mg IV x 1. Because his initial K+ was 6.7, he was also given
calcium gluconate, insulin, and dextrose. Liver was consulted
and he was admited for urgent scoping. He remained
hemodynamically stable while in the ED.
.
On arrival to the MICU, his VS remained stable and he was
comfortable with no complaints. Recent history is notable for
the absence of fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, CP, and SOB.
.
While in the ICU, he had an EGD that showed some esophageal
varices. Three bands were placed during the scope. He never
received a transfusion. He had some melena during the day, but
again, his Hct stayed stable around 27-28. His IV PPI was
switched from a gtt to [**Hospital1 **], his diet was advanced. He was never
hemodynamically unstable.
.
Currently, he is feeling well. He continues to have some melena.
He is tolerating a real diet now, no nausea or vomitting or
abdominal pain. He does not feel lightheaded or dizzy when
sitting up of transferring from the bed to the commode.

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2145-7-7**]: ventricularly paced, rate 83 bpm
.
CXR [**2145-7-7**] (my read): poor quality study, poor inspiratory
effort, no clear infiltrates
.
EGD [**2145-7-7**]:
Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 3 cords of grade II varices were
seen starting at 30 cm from the incisors in the gastroesophageal
junction and lower third of the esophagus. No blood in esophagus
or stomach or duodenum. Two red linear erosions on one varix. 3
bands were successfully placed.
.
Stomach: Mucosa: Granularity, erythema, congestion, petechiae
and nodularity of the mucosa were noted in the fundus and
stomach body. These findings are compatible with moderate portal
hypertensive gastropathy.
.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
.
Impression: Varices at the gastroesophageal junction and lower
third of the esophagus (ligation); Granularity, erythema,
congestion, petechiae and nodularity in the fundus and stomach
body compatible with moderate portal hypertensive gastropathy;
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year-old man with history of DM2, NASH/cirrhosis, known
esophogeal varices, and no prior GI bleeds presents with coffee
ground emesis on [**7-7**], admitted to MICU for management of upper
GI bleed, s/p scope with 3 bands placed. Hemodynamically stable
with no hct drops.
.
# GI bleed: Likely source of bleeding is esophogeal varices or
portal gastropathy though no active bleeding seen on endoscopy.
Status post ligation of varices with evidence of some erosion.
Hematocrit is stable at 29 down from baseline of 40 with no
evidence of continued blood loss. No evidence of significant
coagulopathy. Patient did not need blood transfusion. He was
initially placed on octriotide drip which was D/c post banding.
Patient has done well and is stable to go home. He will  need a
repeat EGD in 4 weeks to check on the varices
-Cipro 500mg twice daily until [**2145-7-11**] for SBP ppx due to GI
bleed for total of 5 days
-Sulcralfate 1gm four times per day until [**2145-7-19**]
-Started on pantoprazole 40mg twice daily
-stopped ASA because of the bleeding
.
# NASH/cirrhosis: He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]. He has esophogeal
varices as described above. No evidence of encephalopathy.
- restarted lasix on day prior to discharge at 80mg Qday since
pt c/o SOB when walking to the bathroom
- Holding spironolactone for now, would restart once creat
started to trend down. He was sent home on Aldactone 100 mg
Qday.
- continue rifaxamin
.
# Chronic kidney disease: sl increase in Creatinine to 1.9 from
his baseline of 1.6. He will need to have outpatient follow-up.
- renally dose meds
- renal diet
- restarted the lasix and on spirolactone as noted above

.
# Diastolic heart failure: Appears well compensated currently
though reports dyspnea on exertion at home. He had improving
pleural effusions on cxray. Initially holding lasix and
spirolactone due to increase in creatine which was restarted
prior to him being discharge. Continue on lasix 80mg Qday and
spirolactone 100mg Qday as noted above.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Had potassium of 6.7 on presentation and history
of modestly elevated potassium, with multiple measurements > 6.
No EKG changes and s/p calcium gluconate/insuline in ED. Has
improved s/p kayexcelate, unclear why so high as no new renal
failure. K was 4.4 at time of discharge.
.
.
# DM type 2: controlled w/ lantus and insulin sliding scale.
- insulin SS
- holding aspirin in setting of bleed, would not restart for a
while as is only preventative and does not have known CAD.
.
# FEN: on regular diabetic diet tolerating well
.
# Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI
.
# CODE: Full code, discussed with patient
.
