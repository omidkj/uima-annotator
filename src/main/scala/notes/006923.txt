Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper Endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
78 yo arabic speaking M with CHF EF 25%, mechanical AVR, afib on
coumadin, cirrhosis with ascites, CKD, and recent UGIB secondary
to AVM s/p thermal therapy presents with melena. History
obtained via arabic speaking RN. Pt reports lightheadedness
yesterday but is otherwise asymptomatic. He reports black stools
x7 days. He [**First Name3 (LF) **] CP, SOB, nausea, hematemesis, BRBPR, fever,
chills, cough, orthopnea, or PND. He is able to walk 50-100
meters or climb 20 steps before getting short of breath. He
reports increased abdominal girth over the last 3 days. During
his last admission 4.5 liters of fluid was removed from his
abdomen. HBV or HCV serologies were negative on last admission.

.
In the ED he was hemodynamically stable (BP 94/58, HR 70). His
HCT was 21 down from 32 on [**10-30**]. INR elevated at 3.9. GI fellow
felt melena was likely secondary to recent AVM in setting of
elevated INR. NG lavage felt unecessary. He received 2 bags of
FFP, 1 unit of PRBC, and 500 cc's of NS prior to transfer to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Pertinent Results:
GI Bleeding Study: INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous
injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m,
blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 120 minutes
were obtained. A left lateral view of the pelvis was also
obtained. Blood flow images and dynamic blood pool images show
no evidence of GI bleeding. IMPRESSION: No evidence of bleeding
.
ECG [**2194-11-14**]: Irregular, rate 81, slight left axis, low voltage,
unchanged from prior
.
CXR [**2194-11-14**]: Cardiomegaly with mild CHF.
.
EGD [**2194-10-24**]: Normal mucosa in the esophagus, Normal mucosa in
the duodenum, Angioectasia in the stomach body (thermal
therapy), Erosions in the antrum and stomach body
.
Echo [**2194-10-24**]:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
5. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
ABD U/S [**2194-10-24**]:
1. Nodular echotexture of liver with irregular contour
suggestive of
cirrhosis. Moderate ascites. 2. Splenomegaly. 3. Patent portal,
hepatic vein and hepatic arterial vessels with normal flow and
waveform analysis. 4. Bilateral simple renal cysts.
.
MRI L spine [**2194-12-5**]:
1. No evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural abscess.
2. Moderate spinal stenosis due to disc and facet degenerative
changes at L3-4 level.
3. Mild spinal stenosis at L4-5 level with right foraminal disc
herniation with cystic degeneration resulting in severe
narrowing of the foramen, which could result in irritation of
the right L4 nerve root.
4. Multilevel degenerative changes at other levels as described
above.
.
TEE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen
in the left  atrium or left atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
dilated. LV systolic function appears depressed. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta. A bileaflet
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis
leaflets appear thickened but move normally without impaired
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic,
mitral or tricuspid valves. No
aortic valve abscess is seen. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. [The amount of regurgitation present is normal for this
prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No endocarditis or aortic root abscess identified.
.
pMIBI: 1. Moderate, fixed inferior and inferolateral wall
perfusion defects. 2. Left
ventricular enlargement with global hypokinesis and depressed
ejection fraction
of 34%.
.
CT Chest:
1. Innumerable bilateral ground-glass nodules within the lungs.
These opacities are visible on recent chest radiographs in
[**Month (only) **], but were not appreciated on the prior chest radiograph
of [**2194-11-14**]. These opacities may be related to pulmonary edema
or infection,, less likely cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, in
keeping with the patient's clinical history. Followup after
treatment is recommended to ensure resolution.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
4. Ascending aorta measures 4.6 cm in diameter.
5. Evidence of cirrhosis, with ascites and a probably enlarged
spleen. There is a hypodense liver lesion which is not
characterized on this non-contrast exam.
6. Hypodense lesions of the upper poles of the kidneys, some of
which represent cysts. Some of these lesions are not fully
characterized.
.
RUQ U/S: 1) No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation.
2) Perhaps minimally echogenic liver with a small to moderate
amount of ascites, consistent with the given history of
cirrhosis.
3) Right simple renal cysts.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB: In setting of elevated INR likely secondary to known AVM
treated 2 wks ago with thermal therapy. EGD on [**2194-11-15**] showed
nonbleeding ulcer and AVM. Negative tagged RBC scan on [**2194-11-17**].
Patient is s/p capsule study which showed active bleeding in
duodenum but no source identified. Repeat enteroscopy performed
with 2 AVMS cauterized in small bowel. From GI perspective, pt
with multiple AVMs who will likely be transfusion dependent as
these AVMs will rebleed as patient is on anticoag. All of this
was discussed with patient and his son.
[**Name (NI) 6196**] daily.  As rebled, started on estrogen (though data on
this is limited). Hct remained stable on discharge, he will have
his CBC rechecked on Monday.
.
# CHF: Patient with very poor EF 25% and mild failure on chest
xrays secondary to blood transfusions and volume resuscitation.
Initially, on lasix and spironolactone.  CHF service consulted
and recommended started digoxin, stopping spironolactone.  Pt
was diuresed with IV lasix 40
