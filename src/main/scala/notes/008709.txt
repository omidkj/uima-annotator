abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 80 yo M with HTN, HL, and PAF on coumadin who
was originally admitted to OSH on [**2140-10-3**] for abdominal pain.
He was found to have a partial small bowel obstruction and was
taken to the OR the following day. He was found to have a cecal
volvulus, which was detorsed and he underwent ileocolectomy with
primary anastomosis of the ileum to the ascending colon. He then
went into afib, requiring dilt gtt, and transferred to the ICU.
At the same time, he was noted to have a worsening ileus and was
taken back to the OR on [**10-12**]. He was found to have dense
adhesions with a kink just proximal to anastomsosis, and he had
a ileo-to-transverse colon anastomosis. The pathology specimens
from both resection showed mucosal ischemic necrosis of the
resection margins. Wound cultures grew ESBL E. coli and
enterococcus for which he was being treated with
ertapenam->meropenam. He had a CTA of the abdomen which showed
good flow in the proximal superior mesenteric artery and flow in
the inferior mesenteric artery and celiac axis.

Immediately postoperatively, pt went into afib with RVR, was
started on dilt and neo gtts, and underwent DC cardioversion.
Reportedly, he has not tolerated CCB or BBs in the past because
of near sycnope and sig. bradycardia (cardiology Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13310**].

He was extubated postoperative day 1 but needed to be
reintubated postop day 6 for hypercapnia. He spiked a fever
about 36 hours ago, was found to have a RUL pneumonia. Sputum
grew pseudomonas and pt was treated with ertapenam->meropenam.
Pt was extubated yesterday and placed on BiPap.

He was noted to be back in afib, Cardiology was consulted, and
he was started on metoprolol and amiodarone.

Pt's family is requesting transfer.

STUDIES:
[**2140-10-23**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Right precordial/anterior
lead T wave abnormalities are non-specific but cannot exclude
myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since
the previous tracing of [**2134-11-1**] further right precordial lead T
wave changes are present.

[**2140-10-23**] CXR:
PICC terminates within the proximal superior vena cava. Cardiac
silhouette is mildly enlarged, and is accompanied by mild
pulmonary vascular engorgement. Moderate right pleural effusion
with adjacent right basilar atelectasis and/or consolidation is
new. Left hemidiaphragm appears indistinct, probably on the
basis of motion artifact, but small effusion or early
consolidation is not excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo M with HTN, HL, and PAF on coumadin who
was originally admitted to OSH on [**2140-10-3**] for abdominal pain,
found to have cecal volvus in OR, s/p bowel resection x2, course
complicated by afib with RVR requiring cardioversion.

# Pseudomonas PNA: The patient was found to have a RUL PNA,
sputum Cx positive for Psuedomonas at the outside hospital. He
was started on Meropenem for an 8 day course, to end [**2140-10-29**]. He
has been afebrile during this hospitalization, and his WBC count
has trended down from 14 -> 10.3 on discharge.

# ESBL E. coli wound infection: The patient was found to have
ESBL E. coli in his wound culture from the outside hospital. He
has been treated with Meropenem, which is to be continued until
[**2140-10-29**]. As above, he has been afebrile and WBC has decreased.
He has had no abdominal pain during this hospitalization.

# Leukocytosis: Attributable to the 2 infections above. Urine Cx
and Blood Cx have been negative. Cdiff also negative. Pt has
been afebrile and stable during this hospitalization.

# Hypercapnic respiratory distress: The patient was intubated at
the outside hospital for hypercapnic respiratory distress. He
did not require intubation during this hospitalization. He
reports breathing comfortably and has been weaned down to 1L NC.
He is currently satting 95% on 1L NC. He also uses
albuterol/atrovent nebulizers prn, which have been helpful with
his breathing.

# Atrial fibrillation: The patient went into atrial fibrillation
post-operatively, which required DC cardioversion at the outside
hospital. The patient was started on Amiodarone 200mg PO daily
with good effect. CCB and beta blockers were avoided, as the
patient's cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13310**] reported syncope and
significant bradycardia while on these medications. The patient
had one episode of bradycardia to the 40s on the day prior to
discharge, but was mentating well, BP 130s/60, and other vital
signs were stable. He has converted back into normal sinus
rhythm and has not had any other bradycardic events. HR has been
stable in the 60s. He should have PFTs, LFTs, and TFTs checked
as an outpatient, as he has just started amiodarone. The patient
is being anticoagulated with Coumadin and Heparin bridge.
Discharge INR 1.8. Please continue the Heparin drip until there
are 2 days of consecutive INR levels between [**1-26**].

# Loose stools: The patient had a flexiseal in place, which was
removed the day prior to discharge. He continues to have loose
stool, likely [**1-25**] to postoperative changes. Cdiff was negative.

# HTN: The patient was on Lisinopril 10mg PO daily as an
outpatient. This has been held during the hospitalization. BP
has ranged from 114/62-130/70, so Lisinopril will continued to
be held. There are no contraindications to restarting Lisinopril
as an outpatient if the patient has higher blood pressures in
the near future.

# Cecal volvulus: The patient is s/p bowel resections x2 at an
outside hospital. The staples were removed from t
