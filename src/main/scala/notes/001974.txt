Admission Date:  [**2131-10-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2131-11-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2083-10-23**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old
male with prior cardiac history significant for coronary
artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, history of
congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy and aortic
regurgitation.  The patient's aortic insufficiency has
progressed from moderate to severe over the last several
years.  The patient claimed that he had a few symptoms.
However, his wife stated that he has had more dyspnea on
exertion and fatigue recently.  The patient smokes
approximately one pack a day.  He is overweight.  The patient
denies any chest pain.  The patient also has a history of
sleep apnea.  A recently performed echocardiogram showed
moderate severe aortic insufficiency with ejection fraction
of approximately 25%.  A repeat cardiac catheterization
performed on [**2131-9-3**] showed one vessel branch coronary artery
disease, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, severe
global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild
biventricular systolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary
arterial diastolic hypertension.  At the time, the left
ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be 29%.  Given
the patient's worsening symptoms, the decision was made to
proceed with an aortic valve replacement as a long term
solution.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  [**6-24**] echocardiogram with ejection fraction of 20% to 25%
with multiple wall motion abnormalities including apical
akinesis, anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis, inferior
hypokinesis/akinesis as well as lateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20% to
29%.  History of myocardial infarction.
3.  Aortic insufficiency
4.  Cardiomyopathy
5.  Coronary artery disease
6.  Sleep apnea

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No known surgical history.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg po q day
2.  Lipitor 20 mg po q day
3.  Mavik 4 mg po q day
4.  Lasix 40 mg po q day
5.  Toprol XL 25 mg po q day

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile, heart rate 70 and sinus rhythm, blood
pressure 130/81.
GENERAL:  Alert and oriented in no apparent distress, obese
white male.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Within normal limits.  No
evidence of jugular venous distention.  No evidence of
bruits.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIAC:  Sinus rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur and [**3-28**] diastolic
murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Obese, soft, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, pulses present and are palpable
bilaterally.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit 30.5, white
blood cell count 10.2, platelets 122.  PTT 35.2, PT 12.2, INR
1.0.  Glucose 119, BUN 14, creatinine 0.9.  Sodium 136,
potassium 4.7.

IMAGING:  Preoperative chest x-ray was within normal limits.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to
cardiac surgery service.  Given symptomatic aortic
insufficiency and also history of congestive heart failure,
it was decided that a surgical intervention would be
appropriate.  On [**2131-10-31**], the patient underwent aortic valve
replacement with a 23 mm Carbomedics mechanical valve.  The
procedure was without any complications.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  Please see the full operative
note for details.  The patient remained intubated and was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management
in stable condition.  The patient was extubated on the same
day.  His oxygenation remained good.  He was making adequate
urine.

Postoperatively, the patient's arterial blood gas was pH
7.38, PCO2 of 34, PO2 of 110.  His hematocrit was stable at
30.5.  The patient was further diuresed.  He was transferred
to the regular floor on postoperative day 1 in good
condition.  The patient continued to have excellent
oxygenation on minimal supplemental oxygen.  Physical therapy
was consulted which followed the patient throughout his
hospitalization and then officially cleared him to go home.
Anticoagulation with Coumadin was restarted.  Given the
presence of a mechanical valve, an INR of 2.5 to 3 was set as
the goal.

The patient remained afebrile.  He remained in sinus rhythm.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His pacing
wires were removed on postoperative day 3.  His urine
catheter was removed on postoperative day 2.  The patient was
also started on intravenous heparin on postoperative day 3
given slow rise in the NR level.  The patient was ambulating
without assistance.  The patient was continued to be diuresed
with Lasix.  He had 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
His incision was clean, dry and intact throughout this
hospitalization course.  On the date of discharge, his INR
was 1.9.  The patient was discharged to home on postoperative
day 6.
