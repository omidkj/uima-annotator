CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post house fire and
carboxyhemoglobin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] is a 60-year-old
male who was found in his house after a fire to his home on
[**2142-9-14**] - apparently during which his wife was
killed.  He was unresponsive when he was found, and an
attempt at intubation was unsuccessful and then a laryngeal
mask anesthesia was placed.  He was intubated in the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room as well as
receiving a left chest tube.

In the Emergency Room, it was noted that his
carboxyhemoglobin level was 49 percent, and Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] was
transferred subsequently to [**Hospital6 1129**]
for hyperbaric oxygen treatment, which was successful.  His
carboxyhemoglobin dropped down to 1 percent after that.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has no prior medical history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He did receive bilateral
laryngotomies at [**Hospital6 1129**] prior to the
hyperbaric treatment.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location **] Corner with his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] does not and does not drink.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  He takes no medications at home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  He was afebrile at
99.8, heart rate was 99, his blood pressure was hypotensive
at 78/43, and his oxygen saturation was 90 percent.  He was a
paralyzed and intubated male.  His head was normocephalic and
atraumatic.  He did have an old 1-cm bump in the midline of
his forehead.  His eyes were 2 mm equal and reactive.  His
heart rate was regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs revealed he
had bilateral coarse breath sounds.  His left chest tube was
to suction without any leak.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  His back revealed abrasions
over the lower part of his back that appeared to be rug rash
from when he was dragged out of the fire.  He had no
clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or any gross deformities of his
legs and arms.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His hematocrit
was 41.8.  His coagulations were within normal limits.  His
chemistries were within normal limits.  His CK was elevated
at 14.3, with a MB fraction of only 1, and troponin was 0.03.
His carboxyhemoglobin was 1 percent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] was determined to have severe
cardiovascular and respiratory distress following this fire.
He required pressors to maintain an adequate blood pressure,
and he required a ventilator to sustain him while he was in
respiratory distress.

He responded well to fluid treatment of his hypovolemic
shock, and he was gradually weaned off the ventilator.  A
percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**9-20**], which
was tolerated without any complications.  He did develop a
ventilator associated pneumonia with Xanthomonas multocida
prior to being weaned off the ventilator.  A swallow study
prior to discharge revealed slight aspiration, and he was
continued on tube feedings via a postpyloric feeding tube
when he was discharged to rehabilitation on [**10-3**].  A
more complete organ system based summary will follow.

1. NEUROLOGIC:  A Neurology consultation was originally
   obtained to evaluate for anoxic brain injury.  Magnetic
   resonance imaging and computer tomography did not show any
   ischemic injuries of the brain, and electroencephalogram
   did not show brain death.  However, as his sedation was
   lifted the patient did not show any neurological deficits
   and did well.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR:  After his initial shock picture, which
   responded to resuscitation and pressor treatment, he
   improved very well.  He did have hypertension and
   tachycardia over the latter half of his stay which was
   controlled with oral labetalol and hydralazine.

1. RESPIRATORY:  His initial respiratory acidosis improved
   while on the ventilator.  On [**9-19**], a bronchoscopy
   was performed which revealed mucosal injury as well as
   carbonaceous secretions.  A percutaneous tracheostomy was
   performed on [**9-20**].  Later he developed a ventilator
   associated pneumonia with associated effusions.  The
   culture results were already described.  With antibiotics
   and diuresis his respiratory status improved.  A Passy-
   Muir valve was fitted prior to discharge, and he was
   ventilating on his own on room air and was able to speak
   as well.

1. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, NUTRITION AND GASTROINTESTINAL:
   After initial resuscitation for his hypovolemic shock, he
   was volume overloaded significantly requiring active
   diuresis with Lasix and Diamox.  His nutrition was
   sustained with enteral tube feedings throughout his stay.

1. HEMATOLOGIC:  He required several packed red blood cell
   transfusions.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  He was treated for a urinary tract
   infection as well as ventilator associated pneumonia.  He
   did have a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   positive nasal swab.

1. ENDOCRINE:  He required an insulin sliding scale.

1. MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient superficial burns on his
   back were treated with topical Bacitracin.  In addition,
   his cervical spine and thoracic spine and lumbar spine
   were cleared radiologically.


DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  He is being discharged to [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Hospital1 8**] on [**2142-10-3**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Please refer to his discharge
paperwork for his discharge medications for the exact
dosages.  He is being discharged on labetalol, hydralazine,
Lovenox, regular insulin sliding scale, and Roxicet pain
elixir.

1. Carboxyhemoglobin.
2. Smoke inhalation injury.
3. First-degree burns.
4. Hypovolemic shock.
5. Hemodynamic monitoring via Swan-Ganz catheters and
   arterial catheters.
6. Volume overload.
7. Hypokalemia.
8. Hyperkalemia.
9. Hypercalcemia.
10.      Hypomagnesemia.
11.      Urinary tract infection.

14.      Hypertension.
15.      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   colonization.
16.      Xanthomonas pneumonia.
17.      Acute lung injury.
18.      Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
19.      Pleural effusions.
