Service: Cardiac Surgery
CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR ADMISSION:   The patient is
77-year-old patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 24717**] referred to the
[**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He is a 77-year-old man who had
a catheterization at [**Location (un) 511**] [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2128**]
after having the onset of atrial fibrillation.

Catheterization at that time revealed no obstructive coronary
artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 68%, and mild
anterior hypokinesis.  On [**2138-1-2**], he had a routine
Persantine stress test that turned out to be remarkable for a
fixed defect of the inferior wall, inferior septum, and
inferior apex.  The left ventricle was dilated at baseline
and became more so post exercise.  The patient denied any
history of chest discomfort.  He does have mild shortness of
breath when walking around the house and conducting every day
activities. Cardiac catheterization showed significant
3-vessel disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is
significant for congestive heart failure, chronic atrial
fibrillation, gout, diabetic neuropathy, silent myocardial
infarction.  His cardiac risk factors include hypertension
and being an ex-smoker.  He is also a diabetic.  He also has
a family history.  His father died of a myocardial infarction
at age 60.  Two brothers had coronary artery bypass grafts,
and both are alive in their 60s and 70s.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   He has no past surgical history.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   He denies any recent onset of
cerebrovascular accidents, strokes, or transient ischemic
attacks as such.  The patient had a normal [**Doctor Last Name 6237**] test which
is relevant to his harvesting.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He lives at home with his wife and family.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.  He denies
allergies to shell fish and contrast.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Digitek 0.25 mg p.o. q.d.,
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. (2.5 mg on Tuesday and Thursday),
allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d., glyburide 6 mg p.o. q.d.,
Cozaar 50 mg p.o. q.d., amitriptyline 10 mg p.o. five times
per day, nifedipine 60 mg p.o. q.d.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratories
on admission dated [**2138-2-18**], were a white blood cell
count of 9.3, hematocrit 45.9, platelets 202.  Chemistry
revealed sodium of 139, potassium 4, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 30, blood urea nitrogen 18, creatinine 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2138-2-27**], he had a coronary
artery bypass graft times four using both a venous and a
radial artery graft on the left side.  The patient was also
diagnosed with new onset congestive heart failure.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit and was extubated and
transferred to the floor on [**2-28**], on postoperative day
one.  The patient was in atrial fibrillation rhythm.

The patient was started on anticoagulation on [**3-1**], and
the patient had rapid atrial fibrillation to 140 range to 150
range which resolved on its own.  A peripheral IV was placed
in the left antecubital in case further necessitated.  The
patient was confused at this time but did not have any
psychosis.

On the morning of [**1-30**] again had rapid atrial
fibrillation and was given 15 mg of Lopressor and bolused
amiodarone which controlled his rhythm to be continued on
anticoagulation.  Rehabilitation was seeing the patient, and
the patient was fatigued and not completely coherent.
Rehabilitation continued to see the patient, and on
[**1-31**] the patient was somewhat more aware of his
surroundings.  He was still in atrial fibrillation but rate
controlled and anticoagulated with INR increasing at this
time to 1.4.  The patient electrolytes were repleted, and the
patient worked with rehabilitation.  On [**2-1**], the
patient's electrolytes were again repleted.  Anticoagulation
was continued.  No significant events occurred, and the
patient's INR came back to 1.5.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On [**2-2**], the patient was
discharged home in good condition.  He was much more aware of
his surroundings and interactive with his family.  The
patient will have [**Hospital6 407**] at home for some
services and monitoring and will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in four weeks as well as with his primary care
provider (who is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 24717**])in [**Doctor Last Name 792**]who will
manage his anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged home on
Coumadin titrated to an INR of 2 to 2.5, also on
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous
b.i.d. until therapeutic INR is reached on Coumadin ([**Hospital6 3429**] will arrange for this as well as INR
draws).  He will also be receiving glyburide 6 mg p.o. q.d.,
amitriptyline 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.  The patient will be given
Percocet one to two tablets p.r.n. for pain, aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. (for him to take as part of his
previous medications).  The patient was taking 40 mg of Lasix
preoperatively, potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d., and
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition on
discharge.  His wounds were healing.  No signs of infection
were noted.
