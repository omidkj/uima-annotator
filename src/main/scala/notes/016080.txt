Chief Complaint:
confusion/somnolence, low blood pressure

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 yo man with HIV (CD4 of 559 and VL
undetectable in [**Month (only) 547**]), ESRD s/p DDRT in [**2114**], DMI, with 3 prior
hospitalizations since [**4-19**] for recurrent RUL/RML pneumonia, who
presents with hypotension and altered mental status. Pt was
found to be lethargic and confused by his partner on [**2119-6-13**]. EMS
was called and his SBP was in the 70s on the field.
.
He was initially admitted from [**4-19**] to [**4-26**] for right middle
lobe PNA treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin due to a
history of partially treated latent TB. He was discharged and
subsequently readmitted on [**5-17**] for fever to 102, hypotension
(systolic 70), hypoxia (90% with NRB), and neck stiffness. He
was intubated and treated with vancomycin and pressors. He was
extubated on [**5-24**] and was treated and monitored for Hospital
Acquired PNA, C. diff colitis, and troponin leak. He was
discharged on [**6-1**] in good condition. However, pt was readmitted
on [**6-3**] with N/V, and inability to tolerate PO x 1 day. Pt also
noted hyperglycemia in the 400s the morning of presentation. He
took insulin at home and BG was 150 in the emergency room. Pt
was thought to have recurrent aspiration pneumonitis and
discharged two days later.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pulmonary:
Pt was admitted to ICU for hypoxia, acidosis, and altered mental
status. Pulmonary work-up was significant for acidosis on ABG on
admission. Chest CT showed right upper/middle lobe
consolidation/atelectasis that appeared consistant with an
aspiration event. Patient has history over the past three months
of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] infiltrate consistent with reccurant
aspiration events. Hypersensitivity reaction was in differential
and hypersentitivity panel was pending at the time of discharge.
Patient's rapid resolution of pressor requirement was also in
the setting of known automonic instability likely from his
longstanding diabetes mellitus. Pt was stabilized and transfered
to floor.
.
Pt continued to have coughs which improved with time. Pt was
satting in upper 90s on RA while he was on the floor. It was not
certain whether this was non-infectious aspiration pneumonitis
vs infectious PNA. CT chest showed persistent RML consolidation.
Given the recurrent nature of pt's sx with periods of resolution
in between, it was thought to be likely non-infectious. BCx was
negative. Pt was taken off of all antibiotics and remained
afebrile throughout his hospital stay, with WBC count WNL. Pt
was noted to have a right sided intrapectoralis fluid collection
that was likely due to repeated central line attempts. Pt passed
swallowing study, although silent aspiration during sleep or
during episodes of hypotension could not be excluded. Likely
scenerio is hypotension leading to somnolence, then aspiration
and pulmonary compromise. Also in the differential were
transplant-associated BOOP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Labs
for hypersensitivity were pending at the time of discharge. Pt
was given an acapella device for clearing mucus. Pt is to f/u
with pulm as outpatient.
.
Altered Mental Status:
Patient's mental status rapidly improved with resolution of
hyperglycemia and hypotension suggesting it was an issue of
metabolic derangement and poor cerebral perfusion. Patient had a
normal head CT. Given the high CD4 count and rapid improvement
of mentation, infectious disease did not feel a lumbar puncture
was warrented. Patient did have an episode of confusion and
visual hallucination on the night of [**6-15**], his first night after
he was transferred to the floor. He had been given Ativan,
Ambien, Amitriptyline together, as he and his partner requested.
Apparently pt had been taking the three medications at bedtime
for many years, although he hadn't taken them in the ICU. It was
felt that his delirium was due to the medications and possibly
due to his new environment on the floor. Ambien was
discontinued, and Ativan was reduced to 0.25-0.5mg at a time.
Amitriptyline was continued as before. Pt did not have another
episode of delirium.
.
Fever/Leukocytosis: Pt had a fever to 100.4 on admission. In the
setting of HIV and renal transplant, the initial DDx was wide.
Pt has had several episodes of similar presentations over the
past few months, which were deemed to be of pulmonary origin. CT
chest confirmed this dx. He did not have any other evident
source of infection. Blood Cxs and Urine Cxs were negative. The
fevers resolved during the patient's first day of
hospitalization and pt remained afebrile through the rest of his
hospital stay.
.
Hemodynamic instability: Pt was hypotensive to 80s/30s when he
arrived in the MICU. His hypotension was resonsive to fluids and
pressors, which were weaned off during his first evening in the
MICU. His blood pressure remained labile. All of his usual
antihypertensives were discontinued and only metoprolol was
begun and titrated up. Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 5907**] (pt's cardiologist)
recs, the goal was to titrate up to Toprol XL 100 mg daily and
Varsartan 40 mg daily. Pt was discharged on Toprol only and pt
will discuss adding Varsartan when he follows up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
Acute Renal Failure: Pt's creatnine bumped to a max of 1.9, with
a baseline below 1. He was found to be pre-renal, as evidenced
by a FeNa of 0.5 and hypotension. His Cr is returned to baseline
quickly.
.
Hyperkalemia: Max K 6.7. EKG did not show any changes since
prior. It was likely due to pt's renal failure and acidosis. It
trended down with fluids, normalization of pH, renal fxn. Pt
refused kayexelate.
.
R upper ext swelling: Pt complained of R>L upper extremity
edema. RUE U/S showed old RIJ clot and new R basilic vein clot.
No anticoagulation was indicated at this time, as the old RIJ
had a low r
