Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7573**]
Chief Complaint:
Status epilepticus in setting of severe metabolic derangement in
setting of liver failure due to NASH and HCC, with prolonged
multifactorial encephalopathy (post-ictal, non-convulsive
status, metabolic derangements) and a protracted hospital course
in light of the above, as well as several complications as
outlined extensively under "Brief Hospital Course".

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Continuous Venous Venous Hemodialysis.
Intubation x 1.
Continuous EEG monitoring.


History of Present Illness:
63yo man with cirrhosis, DM, HTN, and seizures diagnosed in
[**11/2197**] presents with seizures as a transfer from an OSH.
History
is per his wife, as he is currently seizing. She reports he was
in his USOH until this evening, when returning from dinner he
had
a seizure with left head deviation and left arm shaking. EMS
brought him to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital at 8pm. At [**2200**], a
"focal
seizure" was noted, with extremities lifted and gaze deviation
to
the left; he was resonding to verbal commands at that time. He
was given ativan 2mg IV x 1, after which he was reportedly
"confused", following commands incorrectly. At 2105, he was
still
noted to be confused, with "gaze to right". At 2200, he was
noted
to have occasional right gaze deviation. He had labs, which were
notable for NH3 of 139, and had a negative head CT. He was given
lactulose at 0040 and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

He arrived around 2am, reportedly "awake, confused, looking to
right, grip weak on right." When seen by the resident just
before
4am, she saw him raise his right arm, then have right head and
eye deviation, lasting one minute and spontaneously resolving.
During the next five minutes, he had intermittent gaze deviation
to the right, 2-3x, each approximately 30 seconds. His wife told
her this was different from the prior events in that it was the
right, not left, and that he had no shaking. Neurology consult
was called.

ROS per his wife is negative for fevers, chills, cough,
abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, other complaints.

He was noted to have his first seizure while in the ICU in
[**11-22**].
He was admitted for TIPS procedure and had ammonia level in the
200s at the time. On [**2197-12-14**], he was found to have slight left
head deviation with jerking movements of the shoulders and head.
He was treated with dilantin (goal 20-25) and then a versed gtt.
He was noted to have subclinical seizures on bedside EEG. He was
eventually seizure free and was changed to keppra. He has had
seizures since only in the context of AED vacation, and was thus
restarted on the medications. Of note, MRI had shown bilateral
cortical DWI abnormalities thought to be due to hepatic disease
vs seizure; these had resolved on repeat MRI one week later.

tonically deviated to right, but eyes are to the right with
right
beating nystagmus. ?left facial flattening vs drawing over of
face to the right.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
CT - head - [**2198-8-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
or large vascular territory infarct. There is no evidence of
fracture.
2. There is increase in opacification of the ethmoid air cells.
Again seen is opacification of the right maxillary sinus with
central hyperintensity. This is likely due to chronic sinusitis
changes, however, would recommend work up to rule out fungal
infection if clinically warranted. There is no change to the
appearance of this sinus compared to prior studies. A left
maxillary sinus also has mucosal thickening posteriorly, and
there is fluid or mucosal thickening in the left frontal sinus
as well.

EEG - [**2198-8-2**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of
frequent sharp and sharp and slow wave discharges arising from
the left
posterior quadrant with maximal frequency of about 1 per Hz in
the
setting of brief episodes of theta frequency slowing seen in the
same
region. The findings suggest an area of cortical and subcortical

dysfunction along with cortical irritability which may serve as
a focus
for potential seizure activity. No clear electrographic seizures
were
noted.

EEG - [**2198-8-5**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured five pushbutton activations.
In
addition to the pushbutton activations, routine sampling and
spike and
seizure detection programs captured multiple episodes of
rhythmic,
sustained, and prolonged generalized spike and slow wave
discharges
occurring at a maximal frequency of about 8 Hz, at times
associated with
eye blinking or left upper extremity jerking and, at other
times,
without a clear clinical correlate. The majority of these
electrographic seizures were captured at the beginning of the
recording
on the evening of [**2198-8-4**]. These events are consistent with
non-convulsive status epilepticus. As the electrographic tracing

continued, the tracing evolved into a pattern of burst
suppression,
albeit with continued intermittent sharp and sharp and wave
discharges
arising from the left posterior quadrant. This pattern continued

overnight until the following morning where there were several
episodes
of rhythmic monomorphic sharp wave discharges seen in a
generalized
distribution. While these electrographic findings may be
artifactual in
nature, we cannot rule out recurrent electrographic seizure
activity.

EEG - [**2198-8-6**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured one pushbutton activation.
Routine
sampling and spike and seizure detection programs demonstrated
several
episodes of rhythmic 8 Hz monomorphic blunted sharp wave
discharges
occurring in a generalized distribution. There is no clear
source of
artifact associated with these events raising the possibility of

persistent electrographic seizure activity. At other times, the
recording showed bursts of low amplitude activity admixed with
sharply
contoured waves arising from the left posterior quadrant and, at
times,
evolving over the left hemisphere intermixed with periods of
background
voltage suppression consistent with a burst suppression pattern.


CT-torso - [**2198-8-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited evaluation secondary to lack of intravenous contrast
administration. New right and left lower lobe collapse compared
to [**2198-5-7**]. New small right pleural effusion. Patchy appearance
of left lung base raises the suspicion for component of
aspiration. Overall findings suspicious for pneumonia. Clinical
correlation is recommended. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric
tube remain in good position.
2. Small amount of perihepatic fluid. TIPS shunt. No significant
amount of abdominal ascites. No evidence of acute abdominal or
pelvic pathology within the limitations described.\
