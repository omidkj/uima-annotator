Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Cardizem

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
pacemaker lead infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker wire and device removal


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 89428**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation adn tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM in 08/[**2176**]. RV
lead was malfunctioning and was replaced on [**2178-2-27**]. She did
well until [**2179-4-1**]. At that time she had increasing malaise
and chills. Shee was admitted with evidence of a pacemaker
pocket infection and MSSA bacteremia. A trial of prolonged
antibiotics rather than extraction was attempted due to her
advanced age. She received 4 weeks of oxacillin via PICC. Her
systemic symptoms improved. However, the localized infection
persisted and she was referred for lead extraction
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:

.
ECG [**5-20**]: Atrial flutter with variable block. Left bundle-branch
block pattern which appears to be related to paced beats in lead
V2. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
ECG [**5-21**]: Patient now appears to be in atrial fibrillation.
Leftward axis. No other diagnostic abnormality.
.
BCx [**5-21**]: pending x2
.
ECHO [**5-21**]: The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a prominent fat pad. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 89428**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with tachy-brady syndrome,
now s/p PPM lead removal for pocket infection.
.
# lead infection:  now s/p removal of infected foreign body with
open wound. This should facilitate wound healing.  She has
completed four weeks of nafcillin after MSSA bacteremia ([**4-1**] at
[**Hospital1 **]).  ID consulted and touched base with outpt infectious
disease specialist. Agreed to 2wk course of dicloxacillin
starting from day of lead removal as pt without evidence of
endocarditis (though only had TTE not TEE). Last day [**6-3**]. Pt
will follow-up with outpt ID for further management.
.
# afib/tachy-brady syndrome:  currently afib/flutter with
ventricular response in the 70s and normal BP, although she was
reportedly pacer dependent prior to removal of device.  No pacer
wire needed at present.  Continue to hold digoxin and atenolol.
She was initially started on dopamine gtt with hypotension but
was able to come off of dopamine gtt with intravenous fluids.
She was continued on aspirin 325 mg po qdaily for
anticoagulation. Pt will follow up with outpt cards for further
management.
.
# Hypotension: She was noted to have SBP in 70s post pacemaker
lead explantation.  TTE showed normal cardiac output and no
cardiac tamponade physiology.  She did not appear to be in
distributive or septic shock with clinical presentation or
physical exam.  AM cortisol was appropriate.  Thought to be be
likely hypovolemic.  She was started on dopamine gtt which was
weaned off with intravenous fluids. Hydralazine, atenolol and
digoxin were held on discharge.
.
# CHF: history of diastolic dysfunction on TTE but no clinical
history of heart failure per patient's daughter. [**Name (NI) **] pressure
controlled as above.
.
# Wound care: Pt will have a VNA as an outpatient.
Left upper chest:
 1. Commercial wound cleanser to irrigate/cleanse open wound.
 2. Pat the tissue dry with dry gauze.
 3. Apply no sting barrier film to the periwound tissue with
each
drg change and air dry for 30 secs.
 4. Apply [**12-20**] of Aquacel AG 4 x 4" gauze (antimicrobial to
decrease local bacterial bioburden and promote hemostatis)
 5. Cover with dry gauze
 6. Secure with Medipore tape.
 7. Change dressing daily.
 Upon removal of the Aquacel AG dressing, moisten with
commercial
wound cleanser or normal saline to obtain a gel effect and
nontraumatic removal of the dressing.
