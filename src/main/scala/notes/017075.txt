Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Cephalosporins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname 30929**] is a 89F with history of COPD, CHF, aortic stenosis who
was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for low oxygen levels
and increased work of breathing, RR of 44. Patient is unable to
recount history well however in the ED did deny fever, chills,
n/v/d. She was being treated with levofloxacin at rehab,
presumably for CAP.
.
In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report, initial O2 sats were in the 80s, pt was
started on bipap and vitals were 119/76 110 18 95% on [**10-26**] with
40% bipap. ABG showed 7.37 68 76. Labs were notable for a K of
6.4, trop of 0.13. CXR consistent with failure, abx broadened to
vanc, levofloxacin and patient was given nebs, asa, 40IV lasix
with 900 ccs UOP. Blood cultures were sent. Course complicated
by afib with RVR to 140s, came down to 110s without medical
intervention. EKG showed no acute ST/TW changes, however cards
was consulted for elevated trop, thought to be due to demand
ischemia. On transfer, pt was 97 % on bipap 10/5 with 40% FiO2,
with a RR of 15-20. Two PIVs.
.
On the floor, pt appears comfortable on bipap, opens eyes to
voice however incoherent and drowsy.
.
Review of systems: unable to complete due to somnolence, however
pt is able to state that she is not having any pain

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2129-11-25**] 11:40 am Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture
      Source: Nasopharyngeal swab [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 59914**]([**Numeric Identifier 59915**])/[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59916**](SM,RRT).

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2129-11-28**]**

   Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2129-11-28**]):
      No respiratory viruses isolated.
      Culture screened for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B,
Parainfluenza type
      1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus..
      Detection of viruses other than those listed above will
only be
      performed on specific request. Please call Virology at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6182**]
      within 1 week if additional testing is needed.
.
   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2129-11-25**]):
      Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3,
Influenza A, B,
      and RSV by immunofluorescence.
      Refer to respiratory viral culture for further
information.
.
[**2129-11-24**] Blood Cx x 2 Negative
.
[**2129-11-25**] Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2129-11-25**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.
.
IMAGING:
CXR [**2129-11-24**]:  Mild pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions,
likely small and layering on the right side. Retrocardiac
opacity may be due to compressive atelectasis, though infection
cannot be excluded.
.
TTE [**2129-11-25**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.0 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe calcific aortic stenosis. Mild
symmetric LVH with normal global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-2-28**],
aortic transvalvular gradients are higher. Estimated pulmonary
pressures are also higher. The other findings are similar.
.
CXR [**2129-11-30**]: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The diffuse
heterogeneous opacification of the right lung with a denser
perifissural component at the inferior upper lobe is unchanged
from the prior study but considerably improved from [**2129-11-25**]. The left lung is clear. Moderate cardiomegaly and
mediastinal vascular engorgement is stable. There is no
pneumothorax. Possible small bilateral pleural effus
