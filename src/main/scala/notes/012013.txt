Brief Hospital Course:
His chest CT on a previous admission showed a 14 x 9 mm ground
glass nodule in the right lower lobe. Thoracic Surgery was
consulted regarding the lung nodule and recommended follow up in
several months with no need to delay surgery now. Following
several days of optimal medical management, he was brought to
the Operating Room on [**2137-2-1**] where he underwent an aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft. Please see
operative note for surgical details.

 Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition on Neo Synephrine, Epinephrine
and Propofol infusions.  He was seen by the renal service for
his renal insufficiency. Pressors wer eweaned to off and he was
extubated on POD #3, and gently diuresed toward his preop
weight. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per protocol.

 He transferred to the floor on POD #4 to begin increasing his
activity level. Electrophysiology was  consulted for postop
atrial fibrillation with conversion pauses. Amiodarone was
stopped per theri recommendation. Coumadin was started on POD
#6. Metolazone was added on POD #7 to facilitate diuresis.  His
renal numbers remained stable for days and at discharge the
Lasix was changed to an oral form for an additional week of
diuresis.  The gola INR is 2-2.5 for atrial dysrhythmia and will
be managed by the rehabilitation facility.  He was discharged to
[**Hospital 98844**] Rehab on [**2137-12-11**].
