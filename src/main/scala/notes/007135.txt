History of Present Illness:
This is a 51 year old female who was seen at [**Hospital **] Hospital,
NH and was med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] with report of intracerebral
hemorrhage.  She was  intubated and sedated prior to transport.
Neurosurgery called prior to patient's arrival.

On arrival, patient was chemically paralyzed and intubated. Per
report, she was in her usual state of health.  Around 6pm the
day of admission, she went to the bathroom and husband heard a
thump.  Husband found her on the floor.  EMS arrived and she was
noted to rhythmic movements suspicious for seizure.  She was
taken to [**Hospital 15405**] where she became obtunded and subsequently
intubated for airway protection. A CT scan showed a right
parietotemporal ICH/SAH and was med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
During [**Location (un) **], patient awoke and was purposeful pulling at
both tubes using both arms.  Subsequently, patient with
chemically paralyzed.  In addition, patient became hypotensive
and required neosepherine.   No history of bradycardia.  Blood
pressure was 127/80 on arrival.

CT head revealed SAH and Neurosurgery was consulted.

Pertinent Results:
[**5-13**] CTA Neck/CTA Head:IMPRESSION:

1. 12 x 6 mm multilobulated aneurysm of the right MCA
bifurcation, with
extensive associated right hemispheric subarachnoid hemorrhage
and right
parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 5 mm leftward shift
of midline structures and mild effacement of right
frontoparietal sulci.
2. Left frontal approach EVD terminating in the third ventricle.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
3. Chronic bilateral maxillary sinus disease.
4. Bilateral dependent atelectasis with background emphysema.

[**5-13**] Cerebral Angiogram: IMPRESSION: [**Known firstname 9198**] [**Known lastname **] underwent
cerebral angiography and coil embolization of right middle
cerebral artery. She was in a poor grade and will be brought
back later to complete the coiling with the assistance of a
stent to occlude the neck of the aneurysm.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-5-13**] 9:28 PM IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube terminating in the mid portion of the
trachea.
2. Left perihilar opacification with milder hazy right perihilar

opacification. Considerations include asymmetric edema, versus
pneumonia or even potentially retrohilar opacification
associated with aspiration, which could also be considered in
the appropriate clinical setting.

[**5-14**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with preservation of systolic function
at the very base. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline/mildly
depressed free wall function. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


[**5-14**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Bilateral diffuse lung opacities are
persisting concerning for asymmetric pulmonary edema or
pneumonia. Improvement in the left hemithorax opacity could be
due to difference in layering of the small effusion and position
or could be a true decrease in the opacities.

[**5-14**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Status post coiling of known right MCA
bifurcation aneurysm.  Right parietotemporal intraparenchymal
and extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage has not significantly
changed. No evidence of new hemorrhage or mass effect.  Left
frontal EVD terminates in the third ventricles. No
hydrocephalus. Stable leftward shift of midline structures.

[**5-17**] CTA BRAIN
FINDINGS: The patient is status post right frontoparietal
craniotomy with the expected post-surgical changes, small amount
of air is again noted in the surgical bed and significant streak
artifact related with coil material in the right middle cerebral
artery distribution, again subarachnoid hemorrhage is
redemonstrated in this right Sylvian fissure. Unchanged global
sulcal effacement. There is minimally increased subgaleal
herniation throughout the craniotomy (2:109), with increased
vasogenic edema.

CTA OF THE HEAD:

There is minimal narrowing of the middle cerebral arteries
bilaterally, likely related with mild vasospasm. No new shift of
the normally midline structures is seen. There is coiled
material on the right MCA, causing significant streak artifact.
The visualized aspect of the basilar artery and vertebral
arteries is unremarkable, the distal branches of the posterior
cerebral arteries are not clearly identified, however, grossly
there is no evidence of areas of low attenuation in the
occipital lobes. Unchanged left frontal shunt with the tip in
the third ventricle via left frontal burr hole.

IMPRESSION:
1. Minimally increased subgaleal herniation throughout the right
craniotomy site, with increased edema as described above.

2. Persistent subarachnoid blood products within the right
frontal/temporal regions, including the sylvian fissure, with
unchanged global sulcal effacement.

3. Mild narrowing of the middle cerebral arteries bilaterally,
likely
consistent with mild vasospasm.

4. No new shifting of the normally midline structures, the
patient is status post right MCA coiling, causing significant
streak artifact.


[**2190-5-18**] CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring
and support devices are in constant position. There is minimal
fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. Borderline size of
the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions. No evidence of
pneumonia.

[**5-19**] Echo - Mild left ventricular systulic dysfunction.
Estimated ejection fraction of 40%-45%.  Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-5-14**], left
ventricular systolic function has improved and is now around
40%-45%,

[**5-19**] CT head - 1. Stable postoperative appearance status post
right craniotomy and coiling of right MCA aneurysm with no
evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct and stable
subarachnoid hemorrhage with no evidence of acute bleeding.
There is no uncal herniation or shift of midline structures.
2. Ventricular shunt in place without hydrocephalus.

[**5-21**] LENIs - negative for DVT

[**5-22**] CT head -  Status post right craniectomy and coiling of
right MCA aneurysm with new patchy areas of hypoattenuation in
the right frontal lobe concerning for ischemic changes with
incre
