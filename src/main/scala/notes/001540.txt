History of Present Illness:
68 female with h/o severe COPD on home O2, hypothyroidism who
presented to [**Hospital6 4620**] Tuesday with several days
of increasing lethargy, confusion, and oxygen requirement. She
arrived in [**Location (un) 86**] on Sunday to visit her son, and has been more
lethargic and confused than normal, feeling unsteady on her
feet, and complaining of shortness of breath. She has not used
any inhalers, and her son has been increasing the amount of
supplemental oxygen to 5-6L/min. She did not take her regular
medications on Monday, and it was noticed that she had 21
lorazepam tabs when she left NY, and now only has about 5 left.
Her son called her pulmonologist in NY, who thought this could
be due to hypercapnea or too much lorazepam, and recommended
going to the ED.
.
She is a poor historian, though it sounds as though her
respiratory status has gotten much worse in the past 6 months,
at which time she has been on home O2. There has then been a
subacute decline over the past two weeks, which was noted by her
daughter in [**Name2 (NI) **] and then her son in [**Name (NI) 86**]. She has not had any
other symptoms recently, including cough, sputum production,
fever, chills, myalgias, nasal congestion.
.
She was diagnosed with "severe COPD" several years ago, and has
required home oxygen over the past few months. She does not
regularly use any inhalers, though notes that when she does use
albuterol she gets some relief. She was recently prescribed
combivent, but her psychopharmacologist recommended against it
b/c it made her agitated.
.
NWH course: She was found to be hypoxic to the 80s, afebrile,
normotensive, confused. Her initial ABG was 7.25/96/130. Once on
BiPAP, her SaO2 improved to 95%, and RR was 24-36. She was given
solumedrol 125mg, nebs. Repeat ABG was 7.41/60/60. She was less
confused. Her pulmonologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and said she has
baseline very severe COPD, and agreed with DNR/DNI status and
use of non-invasive ventilation. There were no ICU beds at NWH,
so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Review of Systems: As above. No f/c/night sweats. No abdominal
complaints, URI sx, urinary sx. No chest pain, orthopnea.

Past Medical History:
- COPD (unknown PFTs; on home 4 L/min oxygen) - dx 4-5 years ago

.
pCXR: 1. Findings suggesting COPD.
2. Suspected pulmonary hypertension.
3. No evidence of focal consolidation or congestive heart
failure.
.
MRI/A Brain:
The ventricles and extraaxial spaces are normal in size. There
is no evidence of midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus
seen. There is no evidence of significant subcortical white
matter ischemic disease or evidence of acute infarct seen on
diffusion images. A linear flow void is incidentally noted in
the right corona radiata extending to the margin of the right
lateral ventricle indicative of a developmental venous normally.

There are no chronic microhemorrhages visualized on
susceptibility images.

Small retention cysts are visualized in both maxillary sinuses.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct.

MRA OF THE HEAD:

Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation.

IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. COPD flare: Patient was believed to have COPD exacerbation
due to viral URI, though etiology unclear.  She was intially
treated with IV solumedrol and then switched to PO prednisone.
She did not require bipap or antibiotics and her symptoms
improved.  She had negative cardiac enzymes x2 - 1 set here and
1 set at the OSH.  Patient was noted not to be taking any short
or long acting bronchodialators or steroids as an outpatient.
She was discharged on prednisone 40 mg daily, to complete a 3
week taper. She was discharged on O2 continuos 3L, to be
increased to [**3-5**] with walking.

2.word finding difficulty: Complained of having difficulty doing
crossword puzzle after admission. MRI/A head was normal with no
CVA and normal flow. Seemed to resolve at discharge.

3.hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine

4.hyperglycemia:blood sugar elevated on admit, likely due to IV
solumedrol, this resolved as her prednisone was decreased.
Follow up blood sugar with PCP.

5. anxiety: Continued on paxil and ativan

6. Code status: DNR/DNI no central lines.
