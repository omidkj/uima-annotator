History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26213**] is a 71 yo F who has had previous bypass grafts x3
and also a
mitral valve repair in [**2142**], presented with increasing symptoms
of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue. On further investigation
with echocardiogram and coronary angiogram it was discovered
that she had patent coronary grafts with no significant disease,
but she did have severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of
4.8. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography also
demonstrated severe mitral stenosis. The mitral valve repair
previously has been with an annuloplasty band. Left ventricular
ejection fraction was about 50% and she was electively admitted
for redo aortic as well as mitral valve replacement.

Past Medical History:
Mitral stenosis
Aortic stenosis
CAD, s/p CABG and MV repair in [**2142**]
HTN
DMII
Hypercholesterolemia

Social History:
Patient is widowed. Her daughter lives in an apartment above her
home. She has four adult children and a daughter in law who is a
nurse.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
On [**2149-6-17**], Ms. [**Known lastname 26213**] was admitted to the cardiac surgery
service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. That same day, she
underwent a redo-sternotomy, mitral and aortic valve
replacements, with an aortic endarterectomy. For details of the
procedure please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2546**] operative report.
Following the operation, she was brought to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. She maintained stable hemodynamics and
weaned from pressor support without difficulty. On postoperative
day two, she transferred to the SDU. On postoperative day three,
she converted to a rate controlled atrial fibrillation which was
initially treated with Amiodarone. She went on to develop
bradycardia/complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm
which required ventricular pacing. All nodal agents were
discontinued and the EP service was consulted for pacemaker
evaluation. After several days of observation, it was decided to
proceed with permanent pacemaker due to persistent complete
heart block/atrial fibrillation with junctional escape and the
need for beta blockade. On [**2149-6-27**], the EP service successfully
implanted a dual chamber [**Company 1543**] pacemaker with settings
DDD/AAI 60-120. Mrs. [**Known lastname 26213**] tolerated the procedure well and
there were no complications. Her hospital course was also
notable for the diagnosis of HIT which was confirmed by Heparin
PF4 antibody by [**Doctor First Name **] . Her platelet count dropped as low as
110K. She was temporarily treated with intravenous Argatroban
and slowly transitioned to Coumadin. Coumadin was dosed daily
for a goal INR between [**12-27**]. Once her pacemaker was implanted,
beta blockade was slowly advanced as tolerated. She otherwise
continued to make clinical improvements with medical therapy and
steady progress with physical therapy.
