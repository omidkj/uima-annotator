Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
51 y/o M w/IPF on home O2 who presented to the ED last night
with worsening dyspnea. This has been slowly worsening for the
past few weeks, but over 2 days severely worsened to the point
where he was short of breath at rest.  He also has had a cough
productive of yellow blood-tinged sputum for 2 days (normally
has a non-productive cough at baseline).  According to his
pulmonary rehab notes, he has been increasingly unable to
exercise due to hypoxemia with exertion despite supplemental O2.
 He has also had anterior chest pain which he associates with
coughing.  The chest pain is not exertional.  He denies
orthopnea and LE edema.  He has had chills over the past couple
of days, but no fevers.

In the ED, he was intermittently hypoxic to the 70s and 80s on
4L so was switched to a NRB.  He was also tachycardic in the
110s.  He was given levofloxacin for pna.  Because of the
tachycardia and hypoxia, he underwent a CTA which was negative
for PE but showed multifocal airspace disease.  He was admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].


Past Medical History:
1. IPF: Diagnosed on VATS [**2116**], treated with gamma-interferon
for one year around that time.  Has also been on

Undergoing transplant w/u at [**Hospital1 112**] (per pt, currently contingent

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yoM w/ a h/o of IPF presented with a significant worsening of
his IPF.  Moving in bed would cause his O2 sat to drop to 60%
while on FiO2 100%.  Patient was DNR / DNI.  Not on the
transplant list due to BMI > 30 and evaluated at the [**Hospital1 112**].
[**Hospital6 **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] who confirmed the fact that
the patient was not on the list and there was no way to place
him on a list for an urgent lung transplant.  Discussion with
the family led to the decision to make the patient comfort
