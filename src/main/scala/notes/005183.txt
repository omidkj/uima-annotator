Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of plate and flap for sternal wound closure
a line
central line


History of Present Illness:
66M w/CAD s/p CABG x2 (most recently [**2174-9-1**] c/b multiple
admissions with wound dehiscence, wound infection), PNA (MRSA,
acinetobacter), CHF, COPD, HTN who was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] ~10
days ago to vent rehab (NE [**Hospital1 **]) for continued weaning. Pt was
noted to have fever to 102 and tachypnea (vent was on PS)
beginning ~1 day PTA so was sent to ED (initially [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital then [**Hospital1 18**] @ family request) where CXR revealed PNA. At
OSH [**Name (NI) **], pt rec'd ceftriaxone x1.
<br>
In ED here, WBC 26 with 10 bands, lactate 1.6. In addition, ABG
7.17 / 79 / 179 on PS 10, PEEP 5 so changed pt to AC. SBP was
initially stable in 100s but decreased to 70-80s despite 2L NS
so started on neosynephrine.
<br>
On admission, pt was somnolent but arousable and shakes his head
when asked if he is in any pain. Per pt's wife & daughter, M.S.
had been at his recent baseline (A&Ox2-3) earlier today but has
been more somnolent x few hours.


Past Medical History:
-CAD: s/p CABG x2, most recently in [**2174-9-1**] c/b wound
dehiscence s/p pectoralis flap procedure w/ recurrent wound
dehiscence and requiring exploration (by plastic surgery).
-h/o Pseudomonas PNA
-Rib osteomyelitis
-Tracheal bronchitis (cipro, vanco, tobramycin to cover
bronchitis and wound infection)
-CHF: last EF was 44% at cath ([**2174-9-1**])
-HTN
-Hypercholesterolemia
-Severe COPD on home O2 & ?chronic steroids
-Lung Cancer: s/p RLL lobectomy [**2166**] no chemo/radiation
currently no evidence of recurrent disease
-GERD and PUD
-BPH
-Anemia
-h/o shingles
-Depression

Social History:
160 pack year history of tobacco - quit 3 years ago. No recent
ETOH. Usually lives with wife but has been at NE [**Hospital1 **] vent
rehab since d/c on [**1-26**]. Former [**Location (un) 86**] Globe worker.

Family History:
Significant for premature coronary artery disease. Father and
brothers were diagnosed in their 30's.

Physical Exam:
-VS: 100.4->98.8, HR 90-100, BP 111/61 -> 70-80s/40s, 99-100% on
vent
-Gen: middle-aged M intubated
-Skin: sternotomy site w/vac dressing, trach site C/D/I, G-tube
site C/D/I
-HEENT: ETT in place, PERRLA (2mm->1mm) bilaterally
-Heart: S1S2 RRR, distant heart sounds
-Lungs: coarse upper airway sounds throughout; trace sacral
edema
-Abdom: soft, obese, NT, ND NABS
-Extrem: 1+ DP pulses, trace LE edema
-Neuro/Psych: alert, follows simple commands, moving all
extremities equally

Pertinent Results:
-ECG: sinus tach, L-axis, flat TW diffusely but no acute ST/TW
changes. Unchanged from old.
-CXR: bilat PNA, L-sided pleural effusion

CHEST CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:
1. Progressive enlargement of a spiculated nodule in the left
upper lobe, concerning for recurrent lung cancer.
2. Unchanged segmental atelectasis/consolidation in the left
lower lobe.
3. Unchanged centrilobular nodules in the dependent portions of
the lower lobes, consistent with an infectious or inflammatory
process.
4. No evidence of an acute pathologic process in the abdomen on
limited non-contrast evaluation.
5. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of acute
diverticulitis.
6. Gas in the bladder in the absence of a Foley catheter. Please
correlate with any recent history of instrumentation.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 13.2 cm and appears
normal without evidence of stones, mass or hydronephrosis. The
left kidney measures approximately 13 cm and demonstrates a
massively dilated collecting system and a thin rim of remaining
cortex measuring approximately 5 mm. The left kidney
demonstrates no evidence of stones or mass. IMPRESSION:
Normal-appearing right kidney. End-stage hydronephrotic left
kidney consistent with chronic obstruction.

ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. Overall left ventricular
function appears preserved. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall
motion are probably normal. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not  be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No vegetation or abscess seen.
