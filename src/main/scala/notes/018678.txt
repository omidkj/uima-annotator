ECHO -[**1-20**]
This is a directed and limited study to assess the aorta. The
patient was booked as a Type A dissection. On placement of the
TEE, it is clear that there is no ascending dissection and no
AI.
The descending aorta and mediastinum are distorted by clot. It
is not possible to discern an aortic lumen or to fairly assess
the heart's fxn. It is possible to see the aortic valve well. No
AI or ascending dissection seen. Other intracardiac structures
are too distorted to assess.
TEE was used to help place the venous cannula in the right
atrium. Aortic wire could not be seen.
Pre-CPB: The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
After Circ Arrest and CPB:
There were several instances when the right heart ceased to
function because the lungs were full of blood and he could not
be ventilated. With frequent pulmonary lavage and high dose epi,
we were able to regain some cardiac fxn. No AI was seen.
After heroic resuscitation, he had good biventricular systolic
fxn on moderate doses of norepi and epinephrine by infusion.
The patient was taken to the ICU for further care.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (?#). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**11-24**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is mild -moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement. Dilated
ascending aorta.
These findings are c/w a primary pulmonary process (COPD,
bronchospasm, pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea,
etc.).
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2150**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Final Report
INDICATION: 59-year-old male with thoracic aneurysm repair and
fever.
COMPARISON: [**2154-2-7**].
CHEST, AP: Mediastinal widening is roughly stable, measuring 14
cm in
greatest transverse measurement. Left lower lobe atelectasis is
unchanged.
The right lung is clear. There are no large pleural effusions.
Cardiac and
hilar contours are normal. Surgical clips are noted in the left
upper
quadrant.
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable, but evaluation
should ideally be performed by transesophageal echocardiography,
CT, or MR.
2. No acute pulmonary process.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
