Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4373**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Chemotherapy on [**3-2**], FLOX regimen.


History of Present Illness:
47yo M with PMHx metastatic colon CA to liver and lungs,
hereditary telangiectasias complicated by chronic nosebleeds, a
TIA, and a large pulmonary AVM repaired in [**12/2106**] who presented
on [**2113-2-25**] with chest and calf pain and fever. Patient has been
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in pulmonary who embolized his AVM but
felt that the AVM may still be leaking. Of note, his diagnosis
of metastatic colon cancer came only several weeks prior to this
hospitalization. He is on FLOX chemotherapy (5-FU, oxaliplatin,
leucovorin), and is cycle 1, week 2; last dose was on [**2-23**].  He
also had a power port placed without complications on [**2-24**].
.
Per patient was in his usual recent state of health until [**2-23**]
when he developed left calf pain and swelling.  On [**2-25**] he had
the onset of CP, localized to the center of his chest, which was
exacerbated with taking deep breaths.  He also experienced some
SOB. Denies having jaw or arm pain, diaphoresis, palpitations,
or N/V/D. This prompted him to be evaluated further in the ED.
.

In ED initial VS: T:100.0 HR:117 BP:154/84 RR:20 O2Sat:97on
2LNC. He was febrile to 100.8 and noted to have a WBC of 12.5.
The recent port-a-cath placement site in left chest did not look
infected. He was started prophylactically on vanc/zosyn in ED.
His exam was benign aside from a nose bleed but CTA showed small
subsegmental PEs. O2 sats remained stable at 92% on RA and 98%
on 2L NC with HRs and BPs stable. However, with the need for
anticoagulation in setting of AVMs in his lung and nose it was
thought he would be better served by close monitoring in the ICU
on heparin gtt. Moreover, given his h/o metastatic cancer he
needed a head CT prior to hep gtt; preliminary read is negative
for acute intracranial process.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient was quite overwhelmed and
tearful with all of the recent events. He reported continued CP,
similar as described above, worse with deep inspiration. Vital
signs were notable for HR of 97. His oxygen saturation was 99%
on 3L NC with RR of 17. He was hemodynamically stable with a BP
of 132/73.  He had 2 episodes of <1tsp bright red hemoptysis,
but stated that this was consistent with his usual nosebleeds
and stated that it was coming from his nose and not coughed up
from his chest.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest
tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

Social History:
Patient is originally from [**Country 13622**] Republic; he just recently
returned from there, cutting a 3 week vacation short, after a CT
scan of his abdomen showed liver lesions. His wife lives in DR
[**Last Name (STitle) 151**] their 3 yo daughter. [**Name (NI) **] lives in the same building as
his mother in [**Name (NI) 86**].  He has a girlfriend in [**Name (NI) 6607**].  He also
has an ex-girlfriend in [**Name (NI) 86**], with whom he had a daughter.
His ex-girlfriend and daughter were with him in the room.  He
works as a case manager at [**Location 1268**] [**Location **]. Does not exercise,
has cut down substantially on his alcohol, and does not smoke.

Family History:
Mother had well-controlled HTN and [**Name (NI) 2320**]. Nobody in his family
has hereditary telangectasia or epistaxis. No family history of
cancer, except for a paternal aunt with cancer (not of the
colon, pt unsure of type).

Brief Hospital Course:
47yo M with h/o metastatic colon CA, pulmonary and nasal AVMs
with continuous nosebleeds admitted with fever, calf and chest
pain and found to have subsegmental PEs admitted for
anticoagulation.
.
# PE: Likely secondary to underlying malignancy, and given that
the patient has a high risk of bleed from AVM's and
telangiectasias, he was monitored in the ICU during initiation
of anticoagulation with weight based Heparin gtt. LENI's were
ordered to evaluate LE clot burden, they were negative. After
stable anticoagulation with heparin gtt while in the ICU,
patient transferred to floor on heparin gtt. Patient had
nosebleeds, but at less than his baseline amount he reported.
Hct stable, no other evidence of bleed. Patient started on
coumadin; heparin gtt discontinued and started on lovenox.
Patient discharged with plans for lovenox bridge to coumadin
with close INR follow-up in the outpatient setting. Patient
resistant to the idea of injections long-term so would prefer
coumadin as outpatient with simply a short lovenox bridge.
Patient's chest pain and inspiratory discomfort resolved, as did
his calf discomfort. Ambulatory SpO2 95% on room air at
discharge.
.
# AVMs: Stable. Patient was monitored closely for bleeding
without any decrease in Hct during his stay. He had nosebleeds
that he reported to be at or below his typical baseline for
nosebleeds. Afrin nasal spray provided to help with this issue.
Patient instructed to hold pressure and to call if the
nosebleeds worsen or become uncontrollable. Concern that this
might be an is
