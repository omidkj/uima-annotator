History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old male with history of significant CAD with
CABG in [**2177**] and PTCI in [**2193**] as well as chronic systolic CHF
and episodes of ventricular tachycardia s/p AICD placement in
[**2192**] who presented tonight after an ICD firing.  Per the patient
he has been feeling a bit off for about a month now with
occasional episodes of dizziness and palpitations with standing.
 Over the fast five days, however, this has been considerably
worse.  He reports every time he stands up suddenly or exerts
himself  he will feel palpitations and get light-headed though
he can breathe out hard and will feel this go away.  he has
never lost consciousness, he just feels weak and generally very
unwell when this happens.  He has no chest pain associated with
this.  The patient received a defibrillator shock from his ICD
at around 10:00 pm on [**2196-1-10**] and presented to the emergency
room soon afterward.
.
In the ED, he was noted to go into intermittent episodes of VT
with overdrive pacing and vagal maneuvers quickly leading to a
reversion to sinus rhythm.  He remained hemodynamically stable.
He was started on an amiodarone IV load and admitted to the
cardiology service.  After arrival to the cardiology service the
patient had multiple episodes of VT terminating similar to the
events in the ED.  Thus, he is transferred to the CCU for closer
monitoring.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for palpitations and
presyncope as noted.  It is also notable for the presence of
chronic dyspnea on exertion related to asthma without lower
extremity edema, orthopnea, or PND.  He denies chest pain of
syncope.

STUDIES:
.
EKG ([**2195-1-11**]): NSR at 67. Normal axis.  Prolonged QT with left
bundaloid morphology.  Likely left atrial abnormality.  Compared
to previous EKG of [**2195-12-1**] there is no significant change.
.
TTE ([**2196-1-11**]):
The left atrial volume is severely increased. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with near-akinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral segments and mild hypokinesis of the other
segments. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2194-4-7**], there is mild aortic regurgitation on the current
study. The other findings are similar.
.
CXR ([**2196-1-11**]):
Transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead follows
the expected course, left axillary pacemaker. Heart is mildly
enlarged, exaggerated by large mediastinal paracardiac fat
collection. Lungs are fully expanded and not hyperinflated and
clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62  y.o. male with CAD, chronic systolic CHF, and
history of VT s/p AICD placement presenting after AICD firing
with multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia consistent
with VT storm.
.
# VT Storm: Patient's VT is likely scar mediated VT in the
context of his known CAD and previous episodes of ventricular
tachycardia.  Unclear what has precipitated increased frequency
of VT.  Perhaps new ischemic event versus progressive remodeling
(though >1 year since last intervention/known event).  Device
complication (i.e. lead movement) seems extremely unlikely at
this juncture.  Patient was started on amiodarone gtt at
1mg/min, which was brought town to 0.5mg/min after he stopped
having VT episodes.  Electrolytes were repleted aggressively to
maintain K>4 and Mg>2.  Amiodarone gtt was discontinued on the
afternoon of [**1-12**], and he was started on PO amiodarone 400mg
TID.  The original plan was take him to EP lab on [**1-13**] for VT
ablation, but since he was VT-free on amiodarone, the procedure
was held off. PLAN: continue on PO amiodarone and follow up in
device clinic, ablating if medication failure
.
# Coronaries: ECG not suggestive of active ischemia though given
CABG and multiple PTCA patient undoubtedly has disease.  [**Month/Year (2) **] and
statin were continued.  Patient did not want to continue
metoprolol as he believes it exacerbates his asthma symptoms.
Notably, he does have more wheezing after r
