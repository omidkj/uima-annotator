Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year-old female with a history of obesity
diet-controlled diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, history of
clinical CHF (no echocardiographic evidence of systolic of
diastolic dysfunction) but has been prescribed diuretics in
past) who presents with a three day history of shortness of
breath.  She first noticed the shortness of breath while
watching television at 11:00 AM three days ago.  She has been
having difficulty lying down at night to sleep because of
breathing, and has therefore had a difficult time sleeping while
sitting up.  She normally wears her BiPAP mask while sleeping,
but has not gone to bed, so has not worn this in three days.
She does endorse a history of left shoulder tightness that is
intermittent, occurs several times a day, lasts for 5 minutes,
and is not correlated with shortness of breath or exertion.
This discomfort has been present for several months.  Of note,
during the past week, the patient missed 3 days worth of some of
her medications (unsure which ones) because she forgot to fill
up her pillbox.  She denies dietary indiscretion, although she
occasionally has soup, but no frequent canned foods.
Given the progression of shortness of breath, patient called
EMS, who found her to be hypoxic with O2Sat of 86% on RA.  They
put her on NRB and brought her to ED.
Of note, she does report a history of cough productive of white
sputum, and subjective fevers.  She denies any sick contacts.
[**Name (NI) **] nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.  She has
lower extremity oedema that is stable.
In the ED,  initial vitals were T:99.8, BP:177/84, HR:60, RR:22,
O2Sat:100% on NRB.  She was given a dose of bumetanide 2mg IV,
given h/o furosemide allergy, and had diuresis of 600cc.  She
was also given vancomycin 1 gram, levofloxacin 750mg IV, aspirin
325mg, albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer, and methylprednisolone
125mg IV.  She had improvement in oxygen requirement to 95% on
4L NC.
ROS: The patient denies any weight change, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia,
urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait
unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or
skin changes.

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**7-22**]): Cardiomegaly and moderate interstitial pulmonary
edema. Confluent bibasilar opacities could reflect atelectasis
in combination with effusion or evolving pneumonia.

2)ECHO ([**7-22**]): Left ventricular function is probably low-normal,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Probable diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricle is not well
seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Severe pulmonary
artery hypertension.  EF~50-55%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 54336**] is a 71yo female with a history of obesity, OSA, COPD,
and systolic and diastolic CHF who presented with CHF
exacerbation. She was admitted to MICU, ruled out for MI and
given significan anasarca she was observed and diuresed with
Bumex (given lasix allergie) as well as proper adjustment of her
BiPAP settings. Her respiratory symptoms improved and she was
transferred to the medicine floor. Her symptoms all were
attributed to lack of proper medical management days prior to
hospitalization, unclear if due to noncomliance or due to lack
of prescription.
During her hospital course she also was found to have UTI, for
which she is being treated with a 3 day course of Ceftriaxone
(last day [**2175-7-27**]) given resistance of E.Coli culture to Cipro
(see results).

Other chronic medical issues:
1) Systolic and diastolic CHF: ECHO no significantly changed
(see results). Toprol 300 dailt, Ethacrinic acid 100 mg daily
given lasix allergy, (prior authorization request faxed during
this hospitalization) and Lisinopril.

2)Hypertension: Her outpatient regimen which includes
Amlodipine, Metoprolol, and Lisinopril were restarted.

3)COPD: Continued albuterol/ipratropium, fluticasone/salmeterol

4)Gout: Continued Allopurinol 100mg [**Hospital1 **]

5)Depression: Continued bupropion, paroxetine

6)Chronic pain: Continued gabapentin

7)Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
