Brief Hospital Course:
1) Heart Failure/Hypotension - Possible mix of cardiogenic (poor
forward flow) with septic. Pt had elevated WBC with bands, but
afebrile. Pt had elevated PAP and CVP with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Pt had
swan placed to assess cause of hypotension.  Patient's pressure
dropped to 60s, even with max dose of 3 pressors, throughout
hospital course pt SBPs in 30-40s

2) Renal Failure -  Pt remained anuric despite trial on lasix
gtt

3) Leukocytosis with bandemia - Pt remained aferbrile given dose
of ceftriaxone.  CXR showed questionable RLL infiltrate. U/A
suggested UTI.  Pt treated empirically with vancomycin and
ceftriaxone

4) Afib - Pt had history of Afib, held pt's coumadin, started pt
on heparin drip.  Pt's heart rate up as high as 160s while on
pressors.
