At baseline he is somewhat confused but is active and

127/74 RR 32, PaO2: 98%.  The patient was short of breath and
triggered for a tachypnea with a RR of 32. He was placed on Cpap
in the ED. ABG showed Ph 7.4, PaO2 91, PaCO2 46 Bicarb 30. Given
dose of albuterol, ipratroprium and methylprednisolone.  Pt.
already being covered with abx for PNA. A foley was placed and
UA performed which showed UTI with WBC of [**11-8**]. Vancomycin

RADIOLOGY:
 - [**2139-1-1**] SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities in both lung bases, which may
reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded. Probable
trace left pleural effusion

 - [**2139-1-2**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion

 - [**2139-1-2**] RENAL US: Multiple bilateral renal cysts. No
hydronephrosis. Further characterization of the kidneys is
limited by poor visualization

 - [**2139-1-3**] RIGHT FOOT FILM: Three views. Visualized cortical
margins are intact. Bony mineralization appears  ormal. There
are mild degenerative arthritic changes in the first
metatarsophalangeal joint. A small calcaneal spur is present.
There is scattered atherosclerotic calcification. A shallow
ulcer is noted in the soft tissue overlying the posterior aspect
of the calcaneus. There is underlying soft tissue swelling.
IMPRESSION: No definit
