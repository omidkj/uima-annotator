Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
19F w/ hx of polysubstance abuse including heroin abuse p/w
altered mental status. According to her mother, she started
feeling lethargic w/ vomiting, breathing fast the morning prior
to admission. By the night prior to admission, she was pretty
confused and not responding normally. The mother also noted
redness on the patient's arm the day prior to admission. The
morning of admission the mother noted that she was febrile and
"frothing" at the mouth, so EMS was called. EMS recorded her
temperature to be 107. The mother also reported that the patient
had gone out with a boy about 1 week ago and was likely sexually
abused at that time. According to the patient and the mother,
the patient has been relatively clean off of heroin for [**12-16**]
months, although she did have a relapse about 1.5 weeks ago, and
has been clean since then. On arrival at OSH she was noted to be
diaphoretic with fever to 103F. During transport she became more
alert, and on arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] was A/Ox2 and answering basic
questions.
.
The patient's story is somewhat different, she said she felt
fine the day prior to admission, and injured her forarm when she
fell while walking her dog the day prior to admission, but her
mother says the patient had not left her bed that day. She says
her L forarm and wrist hurts and has trouble moving it. When
asked where she usualyl shoots up, she pointed to her L forarm.
She also has pain in her mid-abdomen, which she thinks is from
constipation. She denies suicidal ideation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: 97.8 129 115/62 24 98% RA.
The patient was AxOx 2, but answering most questions
appropriately. She admitted to heroin abuse but denied any other
ingestions or drug use including bath salts and prescription
drugs.  The patient was afebrile. The patient had a negative LP
but had received empiric antibioitics at osh.  Toxicology was
consulted who concluded, "given that the patient has had a
clearing sensorium and without any significant metabolic
abnormalities at this time (ie. no evidence of an anion gap,
renal failure or complaints of blindness to suggest a toxic
alcohol ingestion) we would recommend supportive care at this
juncture". In regards to her reported drug use - heroin is an
opiate and we would expect sedation and respiratory depression
with this drug as opposed to tachycardia and hyperthermia. There
are case reports of "cotton fever" with iv heroin use from the
contaminates of the cotton filter used to draw up the heroin.
this is usually a self limiting and benign occurence that only
requires supportive care as its treatment. In the ED, she
continued to vomit and was incontinent of stool.

Pertinent Results:
Blood culture from [**Location (un) **] ED [**2144-6-20**]: Positive for Fusobacterium
.
CSF [**6-20**]: neg for crypto, HSV, fungus, CMV.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2144-6-22**]:
.
Poor image quality. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is probably moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35%?) most prominent in the midventricular
segments. The LV apex is not well seen but seems preserved in
some views. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. No vegetation/mass is seen on
the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomyopathy. No valvular vegetations seen.

[**Known firstname 8254**] [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 19 yo F with a history of polysubtance abuse
presenting to OSH with altered mental status, complicated by
fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia.

#Encephalopathy: She presented with altered mental status in the
setting of fever to 107 recorded by her mother, lethargy, and
vomiting. The etiology is unknown, but may include
infection/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, substance abuse, and
fever, in the setting of underlying psychiatric illness. A blood
culture from OSH on [**6-20**] was positive for fusobacterium (see
below). There was concern for possible CNS infection, however
there was no evidence for meningitis or encephalitis based on
LP. Substance withdrawal was also a possibility, however urine
tox was negative for ASA, Acetmnp, Bnzodzp, Barbitr, Tricycl.
Heroin withdrawal is a possibility. A head MRI showed limited
due to motion artifact but revealed no gross abnormalities.  EEG
revealed no seizure. She had occasional episodes of agitation
which were controlled with haloperidol. At the time of
discharge, her mental status was much improved with treatment of
her infection (see below).

On the [**Hospital1 **], she triggered for altered mental status - she
appeared sedated and intoxicated and was tachycardic.  Urine tox
returned positive for opiates.  Security evaluated the room and
found no illicit materials in the room.  She admitted to feeling
stressed/anxious about staying in the hospital and asked her
mother to bring in shorts which contained one percocet within
the pocket.
.
#Fusobacterium Septicemia/Cellulitis/SEPSIS: due to IVDU with
needles that she licks introducing oral flora into L
arm/bloodstream.   She presented with a high fever 103F. Exam
showed bilateral crackles R > L. Her left arm was swollen and
warm. In the setting of recent IVDU, her L arm erythema was
treated with IV vancomycin. She received a x-ray of the L
forearm and wrist, which ruled out any fracture
