History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname 8350**] is a 77 yo female w/ h/o DMII, CHF, CAD, and s/p AVR
who presented to the ED for a question of syncopal epsidose and
was transferred to the MICU for managment of hypotension. The
patient has dementia and is a poor historian. She got up to go
to the bathroom today, was sitting on the toilet and was
reported to have a wittnessed syncopal episode. She declines
ever passing out, but does note that she was weak and unable to
move for a period of time when she was on the toilet. It is
unclear who witnessed the episode. The patient was evaluated by
EMS; her sbp was 60 and glucose was 168. No upper respiratory
symptoms. No sick contacts (other than living in nursing home).
No f/c/n/v/cp/sob. No travel.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  [**Age over 90 **] F, 94/43, hr 78, rr 22,
saturation 90% 2L NC. She was treated with levofloxacin 750mg iv
for questionable LLL infiltrate and with metronidazole 500mg iv
once. In the ED her lowest blood pressure was 74/47. She
recieved 4L IVF. Pressures increased to systolic 100 range. Her
lactate decreased from 4.8 to 4.1 with 2L IVF. She also began to
have profuse watery diarrhea mixed with loose stools. It was
guaiac negative. A CTA of the abdomen and pelvis was performed
to rule out AAA and other vascular
.
On arrival to the MICU, she continued to have diarrhea. She
complained of lower abdominal cramping with the abdominal pain.
.

TTE:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with
Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type
of prosthesis (expected upper limit is <23 mmHg). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a mild mitral inflow gradient due to
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen (but may be underestimated). The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-6-15**],
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
77 year old female with h/o CAD, CHF, DMII, dementia admitted to
the MICU for management of hypotension and lower GI bleed.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:

# Hypotension & Syncope: Very likely secondary to diarrhea of
unknown duration in the setting on continued administration
volume depleting medications. Lactate normalized with fluids and
1 unit of prbc. Hypotension resolved with fluids.

# Diarrhea:  Thought to be viral gastroenteritis.  IV cipro &
flagyl were initially started given mild leukocytosis & concern
for possible diverticulitis.  Her diarrhea became bloody during
hospitalization.  GI was consulted & recommended stool cx which
were sent (she was c.diff negative), ischemic colitis was
thought to be the most likely culprit. She received 1 unit of
pRBCs without further recurrence of symptoms. CT abdomen was
negative for diverticulitis but was positive for diverticulosis
and significant atherosclerotic disease in the abdomen.
Antiobiotics were discontinued.

# Lower GI Bleed: Thought to represent ischemic colitis in
setting of significant atherosclerotic disease in the abdomen &
hypotension on admission.  Pt received 1 unit of packed RBCs in
the ICU.  Had several small episodes of old blood on the floor,
but normal bowel movements by the time of discharge.

# Syncope: Pt syncopal event was poorly relayed in history.  Her
hypovolemia, in combination with her preload dependence due to
aortic stenosis, likely caused her to zyncopize.

# Aortic Stenosis: A repeat echo was obtained to determine if
there was interval worsening in the degree of aortic stenosis.
It was largely unchanged from prior.

# Acute Kidney Injury: Most likely prerenal given hypotension on
admission.  Resolved with fluids.

# Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known history of aortic stenosis s/p
prosthetic valve placement.  A repeat TTE was obtained that
showed similar findings

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# Chronic CHF: Furosemide was held given diarrhea, hyponatremia.
 The plan will be to restart lasix as outpatient after evidence
of weigh
