Studies:
[**2143-11-22**] EKG - Possible atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2143-2-21**] the atrial flutter is now present.

[**2143-11-22**] EKG - Narrow complex tachycardia, possibly atrial
flutter. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2143-11-22**] no change.

[**2143-11-22**] CTA Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of dissection or pulmonary embolism.
2. Severe emphysema with stable noncalcified lung nodules since
[**2143-2-18**]. Followup study in six months is recommended to
document stability.
3. Mildly distended colon with air-fluid levels without evidence
of pneumatosis or wall edema.
4. Airspace opacities in the dependent portions of both lungs
may represent atelectasis or consolidation.

[**2143-11-22**] CXR:
FINDINGS: AP view of the chest in upright position was obtained.
Low lung
volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
limits. The aorta is mildly tortuous and calcified. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Emphysematous changes are
again noted. Congestion of the pulmonary vasculature with
increased interstitial markings consistent with mild edema.
Bibasilar consolidations vs atelectasis. An NG tube is seen with
the tip within the stomach.

[**2143-11-24**] EKG - Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response. Occasional ventricular premature beats. Compared to
the previous tracing the rhythm has changed.

[**2143-11-24**] EKG - Narrow complex tachycardia, probably atrial
flutter with rapid ventricular response. Compared to the
previous tracing the rhythm has changed.

[**2143-11-25**] EKG - Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing the rate is slower and the
rhythm is now sinus.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 68 year old male with a history of PE, COPD,
and paroxysmal afib admitted with watery diarrhea, RVR, and
hypotension.

1. Atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response -
The patient was hypotensive and tachycardic on presentation and
received 3L IVF.  When he arrived in the MICU levophed was
stopped and the patient was started on a diltiazem gtt for afib
with rvr.  The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm
overnight and was switched to diltiazem 30 mg PO QID on [**11-23**] and
transferred to the general medicine floor.  On the morning of
[**11-24**] the patient went back into afib with rvr and then into
atrial flutter with sustained heart rate in the 140s.  Oral
diltiazem was increased from 30 to 60 mg PO QID with no effect.
Diltiazem 15 mg IV was given and the patient's SBP dropped from
140 to 98 without any change in the heart rate.  IVF were given
and later on in the day PO diltiazem was increased to 90 m
