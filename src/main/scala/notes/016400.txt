respiratory distress. She states she was born with breathing
problems (but was not premature) and had a prolonged hospital

if she was intubated. The patient presented on this admission
with several days of increased wheezing, SOB, DOE and recently
productive cough. There were subjective fevers and chills. She
also had lower extremity myalgias and arthralgias. Her daughter,
who has had 'asthma' since eight months of age, was recently ill
was a URI. The patient has never smoked.

swelling, throat closing, lip swelling, lip tingling, nausea,
and indigestion) to many foods, including pineapple, peanuts,

a restrictive pattern. She had been evaluated by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4648**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Pulmonary) who thought the patient may have an
alternate diagnosis, such as vocal cord dysfunction.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO/TTE ([**2148-3-13**]): 1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal.

CXR ([**2148-3-12**]): Comparison with [**2148-2-13**]. The cardiac
and
mediastinal contours are stable. No new infiltrates, effusions,
pulmonary
edema, or pneumothorax.

PFTS ([**2148-2-23**]): Impression - Results are consistent with a
restrictive ventilatory defect. Since [**2148-1-7**], FVC has decreased
600cc (30%) and FEV1 has decreased 610cc (54%).

INFLUENZA A/B DFA - NEGATIVE.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, the patient was afebrile, with an oxygen
saturation at 97% on room air. She had poor air flow and wheezes
on lung exam. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia (at 110) with a
normal axis, T wave inversions/flattening inferiorly and in V1
(not new), along with a possible left atrial
abnormality/enlargement. Her CXR was normal, with a normal
cardiac sillouette. She was given Alb/Atr nebulizers, Prednisone
60 mg and admitted to the observation unit. Because of lack of
clincal improvemnt and increased work of breathing, she an ICU
evaluation was called. She was started on Solumedrol and
Azithromycin. She was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. The patient did
well on RA and CPAP overnight. ABX were discontinued. Her
influenza DFAs were then negative and her influenza viral
cultures were pending on discharge.

Upon transfer to the Medicine floor, she had no futher events.
Her breathing improved and she continued on her nebulizers,
inhalers and Prednisone taper. NPH and SSI were added to her DM
regimen while on higher doses of Prednisone. She had a normal
ECHO to evaluate for congestive heart failure. Given the
possibility of laryngospasm, given her clinical history,
including mouth and lip swelling with a variety of exposure, ENT
was contact[**Name (NI) **]. She was set up for an outpatient evaluation.
Finally, the PT team assisted in her care and recommended Acute
Rehab. The patient declined and deferred to an outpatient rehab
referral.

Of note, her chronic microcytic anemia was noted. Her baseline
hematocrit was in the low 30's. She had negative FOBs. Given her
recent low iron/ferritin with a high-normal TIBC, she likely had
an iron deficiency anemia. However, chronic inflammation via
endometriosis could be contributing to body iron dysfunction. A
transferrin receptor level was checked and pending on discharge
to better characterize her anemia. She was instructed that she
may benefit from an outpatient colonoscopy.
