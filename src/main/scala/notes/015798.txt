HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 20741**] is a 29 year-old
woman with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalo-myopathy with
lactic acidosis and stroke like symptoms) who was brought into
the Emergency Room by her mother for a gradual decline in
mental status over the past week that led to a fall the
had been increasingly agitated and emotional for the past few
days. Family members report that she took her anti-seizure
medication of the next 3-4 days all at once and became
"confused". The patient remembers falling, but cannot relay the
immediate events prior to and after the fall.

Until recently [**Known firstname **] was driving, working as a greeter at an
mother reports that she has been less able to care for
herself and has had to move back into her mother's house in
the past few weeks.

[**Known firstname **] states that she feels like she is "going to die" and
that her "mother is going to leave," but expresses no
intention to harm herself.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  MELAS diagnosed at age 18 after
presenting with poor weight gain, headaches, repeated
seizures.  Prior to these events [**Known firstname **] was enrolled in
college.  [**Known firstname 20742**] mother reports three strokes at age 20, 24
and 29 namely one month ago.  Her mother reports no residual
effects of any of the strokes.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, drugs or tobacco use.  Her
parents are divorced.  She is currently cared for by her
mother and a [**Name (NI) 269**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was afebrile.  She had a blood
pressure of 127/73.  Heart rate of 70 and was sating 100% on
room air.  She was lying in the stretcher and was easily
distracted.  She had an ecchymosis over her left eye and some
perioral dermatitis.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender and
nondistended.  Her fundi were clear.  She was alert and did
not follow commands well.  She knew her name, date and place.
She was able to spell her name forward and backward.  Her
immediate recall was 4 out of 4 with her memory being 0 out
of 4 after 30 seconds.  She was able to repeat sentences,
read name tags and follow two step commands.  She was able to
clap her hands.  She had normal facial sensation.  Her face
was symmetric.  Her hearing was intact and her tongue was
midline.  Her muscle bulk was decreased without hypotonia.
She is moving her extremities spontaneously and on command
and lifted her legs well.  She had no tremor.  Her sensation
was intact to light touch throughout her upper and lower
extremities.  Her toes were down going.  Her lungs were clear
and her heart rate was regular in rhythm and rate with no
murmurs.

LABORATORY:  Her HCG was negative.  Her electrolytes were
normal.  Her Dilantin level was 35.

Head CT showed no acute process.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 20741**] was admitted for observation
given her high Dilantin levels and her mental status changes.
Over the next few days, Ms. [**Known lastname 20741**] developed severe metabolic
acidosis with high lactate levels and an aspiration pneumonia
that required intubation and ICU admission. She was given
Levaquin with clearing of her pneumonia. Her lactic acidosis was
succesfully corrected with hyperventilation and fluids in the
next day. However, she failed extubation twice and on the [**8-17**] required placement of a tracheostomy tube. She also had a
PEG tube placed at that point. She then developed seizures that
were eventually controlled with Dilantin, Keppra, and Ativan.  At
this point she developed a second right lower lobe pneumonia. She
was initially treated with Clindamycin and Cipro. Due to her
decreased responsiveness with quadriplegia, a head MRI was
obtained on the [**8-24**] that showed wide spread bilateral
cortical hyperintensitis on FLAIR, DWI and T2WI consistent with
stroke- like lesions and remarkable subcortical atrophy with a
normal MRA. EMG was also obtained that showed diffused severe
myopathy possibly consistent with critical care myopathy. An
abdominal CT obtained around that time showed a right colon
impaction believed to be secondary to dysmotility from MELAS
syndrome. A general surgical consult believed that she was not a
good surgical candidate and had recommended that she become NPO
with NGD compression and TPN for nutrition.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the
neuro-muscular service was also consulted who reccomended a 5
day-course of high dose IV Prednisone. At the end of the 5 days
due to her lack of significant improvement, a family consult was
obtained that agreed on making the patient DNR/DNI, comfort
measures only and the antibiotics were stopped on the [**8-29**].
At this point she began to show clinical improvement and so was
reinstated to full code status on the [**8-2**]. TPN was
restarted and aggressive bowel regimen was begun to try to clear
her partial large bowel obstruction. On the [**8-3**] she
became febrile and was found to have coag negative staph
bacteremia. The right subclavian line she had in was stopped at
that point and she was started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.
A chest x-ray on the [**8-8**] showed increasing
infiltrates in the right middle lobe and the left lung, so her
Ceftriaxone was changed to Zosyn.  As she was seizure free from
the [**7-31**] she was transferred to the Medicine Service
to manage her pneumonia and her partial large bowel obstruction.
After her transfer she remained afebrile and repeat blood
cultures were negative.  An infectious disease consult was
obtained that recommended five days of Vanco for her line sepsis
and fourteen days of Zosyn for her pneumonia. She did well on
both of these treatments. A GI consult was obtained with regard
to her partial large bowel obstruction and an aggressive bowel
regimen including Reglan, suppositories, enemas, Colace and
Golytely was recommended, which helped to clean out most of her
bowel.  By the time of this dictation her abdomen is soft and
only a single mass of stool is palpable in the suprapubic region.
She was on TPN for nutrition for most of [**Month (only) **] until the
[**8-17**] when her family decided they wished to
withdraw treatment and at that point her TPN was stopped.
From a neurological standpoint her Dilantin level was 26 on the
[**8-16**] and so it was held and will be restarted after
her level drops to the low 15.  She will continue on IV
Ativan for seizure prophylaxis.
On the [**8-18**] her neurological status has progressed
to the point where she is not responsive to voice except for
occasionally.  She has been afebrile for over a week and has
improved clinically in terms of her pneumonia with decreased
secretions on the Zosyn.  She will have three more days of Zosyn
and then be done with antibiotics.  Her NG tube and PEG tube are
clamped and she is receiving no more drugs for her bowel regimen.
She continues to receive trach care and suctioning with stable
amount of secretions.  Her antiepileptic drugs include Ativan and
Dilantin.  The Dilantin is being held and his being restarted
after the levels are less then 15.  She is in the midst of a
Solu-Medrol taper.  The only other medications that she is
receiving are heparin and Protonix for prophylactic purposes.
