Admission Date:  [**2188-6-15**]       Discharge Date: [**2188-8-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2127-3-20**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year-old
female with a history of diabetic type 1, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, status post renal transplant in [**2185**] with a
negative Persantine MIBI in [**2188-1-19**] presenting with ten
hours of chest pain.  The patient had positive cardiac
enzymes with a troponin of 7.8, non ST elevation myocardial
infarction, catheterized on [**2188-6-15**] showed severe left main
disease 70 to 80%, right coronary artery disease 99% and left
circumflex diffuse disease and diffuse mid disease in left
anterior descending coronary artery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus,
end stage renal disease status post living related donor
transplant in [**2186-2-19**], hypertension, left pontine
cerebrovascular accident in [**2184**], hyperlipidemia,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, palpitations and septicemia.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine and tetracycline and intravenous
contrast.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 b.i.d.
2.  Lipitor 10 q day.
3.  Lisinopril 2.5 q day.
4.  _____________two b.i.d.
5.  CellCept [**Pager number **] b.i.d.
6.  Prilosec 20 q day.
7.  Bactrim swish and swallow.
8.  Lantus.
9.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
10.  Ambien 10 q.h.s.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft times three, left internal mammary coronary
artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery,
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery
and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and she tolerated
the procedure well.  She was reintubated on [**2188-6-20**] for
respiratory distress.  Echocardiogram showed hypokinesis at
the apex right ventricle.  The patient was recatheterized and
showed saphenous vein graft down times two and the stents
were placed in the LM and RCA.  The patient suffered acute
renal failure on [**6-21**] secondary to hemodynamic instability and
dye load from the catheterization.  Creatinine bumped to 3.7.
The patient was started on CVVH per the renal teams request.
The patient was bradycardic and developed some polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia.  Electrophysiology and Department of
Cardiology was consulted and recommended starting Lidocaine.
The patient had numerous episodes of CVA clotting off and
being restarted.  The patient continued to have episodes of
ventricular tachycardia being bolused with Lidocaine.  On
[**2188-6-25**] the patient was taken for a relook catheterization.
LMCA stent was patent.  Circumflex left anterior descending
coronary artery showed no changes.  Left anterior descending
coronary artery had okay flow.  Left circumflex showed stent
to be patent and right coronary artery stent was patent.
[**2188-6-26**] the patient had another episode of ventricular
tachycardia, but spontaneously converted and the patient had
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation
and was shocked and restarted on Lidocaine and Mexiletine.
The patient continued to have episodes of ventricular
tachycardia and the patient had a continued white count with
an infectious disease consult following.  The patient was on
broad antibiotic coverage with no noted source.  The patient
had failed extubation on [**2188-7-7**] and was percutaneously
trached on [**2188-7-11**].  The patient had cardiac echocardiogram
on [**7-17**], which was normal.  The patient underwent an ablation
on [**7-18**] and AICD placement on [**2188-7-24**].  The patient had
another episode of ventricular tachycardia after the AICD
placement, which had converted spontaneously without the AICD
needing to fire.  The patient then underwent a bedside PEG
placement on [**2188-7-30**] and was at goal tube feeds on [**2188-8-1**]
with mostly physical therapy issues as far as deconditioning.

The patient was continued to be afebrile with vital signs
stable, sating at 99% on trach at FI02 of 35%.  White blood
cell count was within normal limits and hematocrit was
relatively stable in the low 30 range.  The patient was being
rehab screened for placement in the near future.

This is the first portion of a discharge dictation.  Addendum
to be completed at the time of discharge.
