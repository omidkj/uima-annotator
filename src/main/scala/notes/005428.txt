Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Company 1543**] single chamber VVI via cephalic vein


History of Present Illness:
59 M PMH of HTN, atrial fibrillation, h/o lymphoma admitted with
bradycardia.

He presented to ED today with report of [**3-15**] weeks of
lightheadedness when standing that has been progressive over
that time period.  Also has had increased fatigue.  His beta
blocker was restarted in [**11/2197**] of Toprol 100mg qd.  Prior to
that he had an admission in [**2196**] for dyspnea and found to be
bradycardic and in CHF.  At that time, his BB was held given the
bradycardia and his CHF was treated with iv diuresis.

In the ED, VS: BP 129/66, HR 38 RR 11 96% on RA with an
unremarkable exam. Labs remarkable for ARF with Cr to 1.4 from
baseline of 1.   EKG showed Af with slow venricular rate and a
new LBBB.  CXR with fluid overload and he received lasix 40mg iv
once.

On evaluation on the floor, the patient reports that he feels
well laying down but would be dizzy if he tried to get up. He
denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, PND or orthopnea.
Denies increase lower extremity swelling.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
[**3-/2197**]
The left atrium is dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
The RV may be slightly dilated/hypokinetic. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.

Stress Echo [**11/2197**]:
57 yo man with Afib and recent episode of CHF was referred for
evaluation of shortness of breath. The patient performed 6
minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol ~7 METs and stopped for fatigue.
This represents a fair exercise tolerance. No neck, back, arm or
chest discomfort was reported. Appropriate increase in shortness
of breath with the exercise. No significant ST segment changes
were noted. Rhythm
was Afib with one rare isolated VPDs and three V.couplets. Blood

pressure response to exercise was appropriate. Rapid increase in

ventricular rate at a low level of exercise.

IMPRESSION: Fair exercise tolerance. No anginal type symptoms or

ischemic EKG changes. Echo report sent separately.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo M with history of atrial fibrillation presenting with
bradycardia likely from beta blocker use with heart rates in the
40's now s/p PPM.
.
# RHYTHM:  Patient with history of atrial fibrillation.
Admission EKG with Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular
response with heart rates in the 30-40's. Etiology thought
secondary to beta blcokade BB as patient with a similar
presentation in [**2196**] in setting of beta blocker use. On
admission beta blocker stopped and patinet monitored on
telemetry. HRs remained in 40s and though patient largely
asymptomatic decision made to placed pacemaker for rate control.

Regarding anticoagulation, patient on coumadin as an outpatient;
coumadin held in setting of procedure but restarted prior to
discharge.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
- Follow-up in device clinic
- INR monitoring
.
# CORONARIES:  No h/o CAD. Stress echo in [**11/2197**] with no
evidence of ischemia.
