Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted with presumed CHF exacerbation most likely
secondary to increased dietary salt intake and severe aortic
stenosis. Pt was diursed and treated with O2.


CHR Exacerbation:
Patient was diuresed.  She was initially started on antibiotics
for question on pneumonia which were then stopped after her
white count normalized.

She was continued on her IV vancomycin course which was started
at a previous hospital stay for strep viridans bacteremia. She
was afebrile for the duration of her stay.  The patient was
diursed and treated with oxygen and improved.  Pt has prior hx
of GI bleed and had heme positive stools.  Her hct remained
stable throughout her hospitalization.  She received 2 units of
PRBC for a hct of 23, which was later determined to be near her
baseline of 25.

She was discharged in stable condition to home with home oxygen
as she had ambulatory desats to 87%.  She has follow with her
PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) 444**] of her vancomycin levels and follow with with
GI for colonoscopy.  She was also instructed to follow up with
her cardiologist for managment of congestive heart failure and
her neprologist for her kidney failure.

neurontin was changed to 300mg every other day.  She was resumed

enzymes were negative and there were no ECG changes.  Her ACE-i
was held in the setting of her acute renal failure, she was
continued on her Aspirin and beta blocker.

Aortic Stenosis:
Her severe aortic stenosis was thought to be a contributing
factor to her current CHF exacerbation.  She has had a past
valvuloplasty and was determinted not to be a candidate for any
further intervention at this time

Strep viridans bacteremia:
She had a rencent echocardiogram that was negative for
endocarditis.  Her blood cultures were negative for her length
of stay.  She remained on Vancomycin.

on her PPI and was set up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] as an outpatient for
