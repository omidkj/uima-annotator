Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was a direct admission to operating room (please see OR
report for full details), she had an AVR(#21 pericardial
valve)CABGx3(LIMA-LAD, SVG-Diag, SVG-RCA)and repair Coronary
sinus. Pt tolerated the operation however in the immediate
post-op period she was noted to have a distended abdomen,
metabolic acidosis, poor urine output with bladder pressures of
32 and an elevated WBC. The general surgery service was
consulted and pt was tapped for 1.5 liters of acitic fluid. The
hepatobiliary service was also consulted as was ID and renal.
Over the next several days the pt had elevated BUN/Cr, LFT's and
WBC all resolved without clear explaination. The patient was
slow to wake and had diffuse muscle weakness post-op and
therefore was not extubated until POD 4, she was noted to have
left sided weakness and difficulty swallowing after extubation,
she failed a swallow evaluation and a head CT at that time
showed a subacute infarct in the same area as a previous
subdural hematoma.
The patient stayed in the ICU after extubation because her
pulmonary status was tenuous requiring vigorous pulmonary
toilet.
The patient continued to make progress over the next several
days but it was felt by the ICU team that she would require a
stay in rehabilitaion before returning home. On POD 13 it was
felt that the patient was stable and ready for discharge to
rehabilitation.
