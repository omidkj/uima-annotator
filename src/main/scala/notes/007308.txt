Brief Hospital Course:
1.  STEMI:  evaluated in ER, found to be in ST elevation MI,
sent to cath lab for immediate intervention.  Cath completed
with stents placed in LAD and RCA, no complications.  Monitored
on the cardiac med floor for 72 hours with no significant
events.  Vital signs were stable and he remained asymptomatic
during his recovery.  After cath, medical management was
continued with ASA, plavix, BB, ACEI, and statin.

2.  CHF:  remained without significant peripheral or pulm edema
throughout admission.  Was kept on fluid restriction at 1.5L/day
and received hemodialysis x 1 during his hospital stay with good
success.

3.  PAF:  he remained with normal sinus rhythm on quinidine
during his admission.

4. ESRD:  received HD once during admission, with no
complications.

5. DM:  blood glucose welll-controlled during admission with
outpt NPH regimen.

6.  Thrombocytopenia:  platelets low at admission with unclear
etiology.  This was prior to receiving heparin, so HIT is not
likely.  Platelets have consistently increased in the hospital,
now at 85 at DC.

7.  HTN:  not well-controlled at admission.  We increased
captopril dose to 50 mg PO QD with fair response, but BP remains
with sub-optimal control at DC.

8.  Mental status:  he was disoriented at admission, with marked
somnolence/confusion after cath.  MS progressively improved
throughout stay; at DC, remains with variable confusion, but at
best is verbally interactive and oriented to person and
sometimes place.
