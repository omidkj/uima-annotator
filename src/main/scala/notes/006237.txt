History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was in his usual state of health until yesterday
morning. He walks with a cane and has some chronic health
problems (see below), and although he is likely able to look
after himself, he lives with his daughter and her family.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7152**] stays at home during the day when his
daughter and her family are out to work.  Yesterday he made a
[**Location (un) 6002**] shortly before 1 p.m. and carried it out of the kitchen
and placed it on the table. He fell over and lay down on the
floor around that time, remembering that he looked at the clock.
Some family members came home at 3:30 in the afternoon to find
him lying on his back with his feet against the door, but wide
awake. He said at that time that he wanted to sit on the floor
to
eat his [**Location (un) 6002**], but his lunch was untouched. He could move his
arms and legs and, with some help, got to his feet and over to
the Ottoman where he then lay down. His daughter was then called
and appeared a short time later from work. He was still lying on
the Ottoman and said he was hungry and had a headache. He was
excited that his daughter was warming his favorite oyster soup
for him and ate some soup. He went to the bathroom to get
dressed, given that he was still in his underwear when these
events had transpired. He had some difficulty getting up, but
was
not clearly weak on one side or the other and then used his cane
and walked to the bathroom.  His daughter thinks that he had
trouble changing the bathroom - "I'll be out shortly" he kept
saying, but he stayed in the bathroom for a long time. Finally
His daughter finally went in to find him drowsy or sleeping on
the "pot". He said he was sleepy and cold. His pants were around
his ankles but he seemed to not notice that he wasn't dressed.
His daughter realized that something was clearly wrong at this
time and tried to help him so that she could get him on to the
wheelchair, into the car and to the hospital. Drowsiness
increased and she said that he seemed "lifeless and weak" on
"both sides" when tried to get up. Finally they got him out of
the bathroom, he enjoyed some more soup and butter, then started
trying to take his clothes off again saying he was going to bed.
At this point the family called 911.

EMS took him to [**Hospital 67742**] Medical Center, where a NCHCT revealed
a
right basal ganglia hemorrhage without shift, but with
surrounding edema. His INR at OSH 2.03 - he takes Coumadin given
atrial fibrillation - so he received 2 units FFP and 10 mg IV
Vitamin K. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] he was given labetalol drip for hypertension
and admitted to the ICU under the care of Neurology, having also
been evaluated by Neurosurgery.

On arrival in the ICU, after discussion of the goals of care
with
his daughter, an external ventricular drain was place after
endotracheal intubation. He had become increasingly drowsy and
would grimace to pain, but there was no eye opening to any
stimulus and no spontaneous movement. He also vomited on arrival
in the ICU and aspirated some vomitus, resulting in the
placement
of a nasogastric tube.

Past Medical History:
- Coronary artery disease
- Hypertension
- Congestive Heart Failure, further details unknown
- Atrial Fibrillation on Coumadin
- Left  shoulder injury
- Right knee replacement
- Prior cerebral aneurysm with hemorrhage 3-4 years ago, details
unknown - this possibly resulted in mild left arm and leg
weakness
- Questionable seizure in past

Social History:
He is retired and lives with his daughter in [**Name (NI) 3844**]. He
ambulates with a cane and is independent of his ADLs. He still
drives. No smoking, drinking, or alcohol use.


Family History:
Mother still alive at age [**Age over 90 **]. Daughter not aware of any family
history of brain hemorrhages.
