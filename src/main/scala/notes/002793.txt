History of Present Illness:
50yo F PMHx schizoaffective disorder, trachea malacia w chronic
tracheostomy, recent [**Hospital 18**] hospital stay for CO2 laser treatment
of high tracheal stenosis, trach downsizing (Portex No 6), and
subsequent failing of red capping, discharged to [**Hospital1 **] State
[**Hospital **] Hospital [**2109-2-16**] with plan for outpatient IP follow-up,
who subsequently was admitted to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center [**2109-2-20**]

.
IMAGING
.
Chest X-ray ([**2109-2-22**]):
Tracheostomy [**Month/Day/Year **] has been placed and is in standard position.
Right PICC terminates in lower superior vena cava. Heart is
enlarged,
accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild perihilar
edema.
Opacity at right lung base obscuring the medial right
hemidiaphragm probably reflects atelectasis, but pneumonia is
also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Probable
small left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
50F w/schizoaffective disorder, tracheomalacia s/p chronic
tracheostomy, recent [**Hospital 18**] hospital stay for trach downsizing
and treatment of high tracheal stenosis admitted from an outside
hospital for recurrent tracheostomy plugging and hypoxia to the
50s. Hospital course was notable for upsizing of trach [**Hospital **] with
resolution of mucous plugging and hypoxia.
.
# TRACH PLUGGING/HYPOXIA
Known hx trachea malacia s/p tracheostomy, recently undergoing
trach downsizing presented w recurrent plugging of tracheostomy
and hypoxia. Underwent trach upsizing intra-operatively by
interventional pulmonology, to size 7. Patient did well
thereafter, ambulatory w/O2 sats in the mid90s/RA. Some thin
mucous occasionally suctioned by nursing. Also received home
duonebs and mucinex.
.
#OSH CONCERN FOR PNEUMONIA
There was also concern for PNA at OSH prior to transfer because
sputum sample gathered (in setting of hypoxia and WBC 4.9 w 13%
bands) grew MSSA. Had been receiving vanco/ceftaz there - this
was stopped on MICU admission [**2-22**] when she was found to be
hemodynamically stable, breathing fine on trach mask, with
unremarkable pulm exam. Afebrile, WBC remained wnl, bandemia
already resolved on arrival.
.
# OSH TROPONIN ELEVATION
Trop I elevation to 0.144 at OSH, no ischemic changes noted on
TTE. Thought [**12-20**] strain in setting of hypoxia and recurrent
trach plugging before collar upsized. Very low suspicion for
ongoing cardiac process. Cardiac enzymes repeated in the MICU
were trop <0.01.
.
# SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER
Chronic condition which prompted initial inpatient psych
admission at [**Hospital1 **] State Hospital. Patient was initially
continued on her home medications of divalproex, benztropine,
trazodone, lithium, prn ativan. Psychiatry consulted for
agitation in the MICU, followed closely. They recommended
increasing valproate, decreasing benztropine, and dc'ing ativan.
Patient remained agitated and pleasant but difficult to manage
on the floor after MICU callout, requiring 2:1 nursing/MD
reassurance and assistance nearly continuously. She was
discharged back to her previous [**Hospital1 **] Psychiatric facility.
.
# Hypothyroidism. TSH 0.79 (wnl). Her levothyroxine was
continued.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
.
HALDOL DEPOT DOSING
Note: patient did not receive any of her 240 mg IV qmonth haldol
depot injections because last date of administration could not
be obtained from prior inpatient psych facility. [**Month (only) 116**] be due.
.
VALPROATE LEVEL MONITORING
Dose increased to 750 [**Hospital1 **] on [**2-23**] after level 39
(subtherapeutic). Needs repeat valproic acid level check on
[**2109-2-26**] and dose adjustment PRN for goal level 50-100.
.
RESPIRATORY RECOMMENDATIONS
Patient may need trach collar suctioning q2h or more frequently
PRN for mucous plugging and/or hypoxia/dyspnea.
Needs humifified air by trach collar qHS.
Recommend duonebs q6H and PRN for any respiratory distress.
