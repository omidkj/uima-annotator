Date of Birth:  [**2101-5-5**]             Sex:   F

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Phenergan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5037**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion, hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
65 yo F with a history of IDDM complicated by end-stage renal
disease s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2160**], HTN, PVD,
diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation who presents
with SOB, DOE, fatigue, hemetemesis and hypotension.
.
She had been feeling progressively worse than her baseline for
the past few days prior to admission. 4days PTA, she reports
normal resp status. Then, 3days PTA, she saw her cardiologist,
was very fatigued and felt DOE. Over next few days her DOE got
worse. On morning of admission, she awoke with mid back pain,
SOB, and nausea. She had emesis at 5 a.m. X 3, with 3rd one with
1 tsp bright red [**Year (4 digits) **] and some epigastric discomfort. She was
coughing at the time, but does feel that the [**Year (4 digits) **] was from
emesis not from sputum.

She went to OSH, she was found to have stable HCT, she received
FFP (? 4units), Vit K 5 mg SQ, and NS X 1. She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].

In ED, 98.5, 100/40, 58, 100%RA. Her BP dipped to 81/21. She
received 2U FFP, 10 IV Vit K, and BP returned to 100's. CT chest
and CXR revealed large new R effusion vs RLL collapse. BP in
80-90's, most likely not due to GIB. No plans for scope until
other issues resolve.

Transferred to MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for possible UGIB. In MICU, guaiac
negative and had stable Hct. Felt that [**Hospital1 **] was more likely due
to hemoptysis rather than hematemesis. Had hypoxia, new oxygen
requirement. Treated with Levofloxacin for possible CAP.  On
morning of transfer to MICU, patient had posttussive hemoptysis,
with O2 requirement decreasing from 5L to 3L.  Given RLL
collapse/R effusion, there was concern for endobronchial mass
not seen on CT, causing hypoxia and hemoptysis. Pt was in stable
condition however, and decision was made for transfer to floor
for further management.

On the floor, she reports feeling fatigued and SOB. She denies
LHD, fever, abd pain, further N/V. She denies any BRBPR, melena,
hemoptysis. She does report feeling more gaseous with increased
need for burping in last few days, but she denies any CP,
palpitations, chest pressure. + orthopnea and LE swelling
worsening for past few days as well. Only recent changes in meds
include stopping amiodarone. + lower back pain which is new.

[**1-9**] CXR
FINDINGS: There is interval development of a large right-sided
pleural
effusion. Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Left lung
remains
clear. Heart size cannot be accurately assessed. There is no
pneumothorax.
Atherosclerotic calcifications along the aortic knob are again
noted. There is no definite evidence of free air in the upper
abdomen.

[**1-9**] CT CHEST AND ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited non-contrast evaluation, but no evidence of
catastrophic injury to the aorta, or esophagus.
2. Right lower lobe collapse appears secondary to mucous plug in
the right
lower lobe segmental bronchus. Atelectasis at both lung bases.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
5. Atherosclerosis, and marked three-vessel coronary artery
calcification.

[**1-10**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid
to distal septal hypokinesis. The remaining segmetns are
hyperdynamic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. with
borderline normal free wall function. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is
