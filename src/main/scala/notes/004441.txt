Chief Complaint:
S/P out of hospital cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pulmonary intubation


History of Present Illness:
55M with hx of multiple prior MI's including hx of silent MI,
remote CABG, recent AAA repair [**6-/2161**], afib previously on
coumadin (off for ~3 months), and DM c/b toe amputation admitted
to the CCU s/p initation of post-arrest cooling protocol. The
patient was in the passenger seat of his car with his girlfriend
and had just left a VA appt for lab work. Per his girlfriend he
slumped over towards her and then became unresponsive. He did
not complain of any pain or abnl sxs prior to becoming
unresponsive. He was removed from the car to the sidewalk and a
code was called. He was initally shocked by [**Location (un) 86**] PD for vfib
and CPR started. He was shocked again x 1 for vfib and intubated
PTA. He arrived in the ED in PEA and CPR was begun. He received
epi 1mg with ROSC, however he coded again in the ED requiring a
2nd epi 1mg. He was started on a Levophed and Dopamine gtt and a
left subclavian was placed. Total down time prior to arrival to
the emergency department was approximately 12 minutes. BS ECHO
in ED showed inferior wall hypokinesis (possibly old) and global
hypokinesia.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain review of systems as he is sedated,
intubated, paralyzed and cooled. Per his partner, he was not
complaining of any symptoms such as fevers, chills, cough, chest
pain, SOB, DOE, Abd pain, N/V/D, Bleeding from stools or urine,
numbness, weakness, or tingling.

echo [**10-11**] The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis/thinning of the basal half of the
inferolateral and severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. No
pericardial effusion.
.
CT head [**10-11**] There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass
effect. A
hypodensity in the right frontal lobe along the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the right
lateral ventricle could represent subacute area of ischemia
(2:20).
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci reflects generalized
atrophy. Subtle areas of periventricular white matter
hypodensity may reflect sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic
disease. No concerning osseous lesion or fracture is identified.
Aerosolized secretions and fluid are seen within the ethmoid air
cells and sphenoid sinus as well as within the nasopharynx,
consistent with intubation. The maxillary sinuses and mastoid
air cells are clear. There are calcifications of the carotid
siphons.
IMPRESSION: Hypodensity in the right frontal lobe could
represent an area of subacute ischemia.
.
CT chest abd pelvis [**10-11**] CT CHEST: No pulmonary arterial
filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism is seen. The aorta
is normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of acute
aortic syndrome. There are extensive vascular calcifications
involving the coronary arteries and aortic valve. There is
moderate cardiomegaly. No pericardial effusion is seen. The
lungs demonstrate bilateral dependent opacities, which could
represent aspiration. Septal thickening is suggestive of
pulmonary edema. There is a background of emphysema with upper
lobe predominance. No endobronchial lesion is seen. A small
amount of secretion/aspiration is seen within the distal trachea
extending to the right mainstem bronchus.
No lymphadenopathy is identified. An endotracheal tube is in
standard
position. An esophageal catheter courses into the stomach. A
left-sided
subclavian central venous catheter is in place with tip in the
distal
brachiocephalic vein on the left.
.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: There is mild periportal edema. No focal
liver lesion is seen. The gallbladder is contracte
