HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
female with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial
fibrillation (status post pacemaker), and cervical
spondylosis who fell from standing two days prior to
admission.

On the day of transfer to this hospital, the patient had
presented to [**Hospital6 8283**] with nausea,
vomiting, and some dizziness.  A head computed tomography at
that time was reported as negative, but they did note a C2
cervical spine fracture, and the patient was transferred here
emergently but in stable condition.

There had been no neurologic deficits (per report) on her
arrival.  Also, at the initial time of workup at [**Hospital6 4299**] she had been on Coumadin for her atrial
fibrillation.  She was given vitamin K and fresh frozen
plasma and transferred here in anticipation of a possible
surgical intervention.

When she arrived to the Emergency Room bay, she was
neurologically intact.  She had worsening oxygen saturation
and increasing rales at the bases.  This was thought to be
secondary to the fresh frozen plasma which was given to her
at [**Hospital6 8283**].  She was diuresed
appropriately and appropriately responded with return of
saturations, and she otherwise remained intact.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history significant for)
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Atrial fibrillation; status post pacemaker.
3.  Cervical spondylosis.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  (Past surgical history is significant
for)
1.  Bilateral total knee replacement.
2.  Right total hip replacement.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission
included)
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Prozac 20 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.
5.  Wellbutrin 150 mg by mouth q.a.m. and 100 mg by mouth
q.p.m.
6.  Neurontin 100 mg by mouth three times per day
7.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
8.  Losartan 20 mg by mouth once per day.
9.  Coumadin 5 mg by mouth once per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed her temperature was 97.1 degrees
Fahrenheit, heart rate was 65 (paced), blood pressure was
132/72, respiratory rate was 18, and oxygen saturation was
95% on a 5-liter face mask.  In general, she was lying on a
board in a cervical collar, in no acute distress.  Her pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Her face was
stable.  Her heart was regular.  Her chest had no crepitus
and was stable.  Her lung sounds had bilateral rales at the
bases.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
She had no extremity edema.  She was moving all four
extremities with a nonfocal neurologic examination.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed white blood cell count? was 37.5, blood
urea nitrogen was 22, and creatinine was 0.8.  Urinalysis was
negative.  Cardiac enzymes were within normal limits.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Radiologic examination included
a computed tomography of the cervical spine which
demonstrated fractures of the C1 ring and dens, severe disc
degenerative changes in the lower cervical spine, and
effusion of C4 and C5 vertebral bodies.

Radiologic films of the lumbar spine and thoracic spine were
unremarkable for any fractures or dislocations.

Of note, with these computerized axial tomography scans, it
was noted the patient had a lung radiograph consistent with
pulmonary edema.

A head computed tomography done here demonstrated no
intracranial hemorrhage.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was left in
a hard collar.  After initial film studies were done, she was
diuresed and her pulmonary status dramatically improved.  She
remained hemodynamically stable.

The Neurosurgery team was consulted.  The Neurosurgery team
discussed all the options with the patient.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] and
the patient came to the conclusion that at this current time
she would not undergo any surgical cervical fusion.  Rather,
the patient was to be discharged to home to think about the
decision and was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in one week.
During this period of time, she was also to remain off the
Coumadin in case she decides to have surgical treatment and
was to contact her primary care physician regarding
management of her Coumadin.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient continued to remain
neurologic intact with a nonfocal neurologic examination.
She was tolerating a regular diet and was discharged from the
Trauma Intensive Care Unit to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post fall with a cervical fracture and odontoid
fracture with no neurologic defects.
2.  Sick sinus syndrome; status post pacemaker in the past.
3.  Atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin for an INR of 1.5 to 2.5
which will be held).
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Cervical spondylosis.
6.  Depression.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Prozac 20 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.
5.  Wellbutrin 150 mg by mouth q.a.m. and 100 mg by mouth
q.p.m.
6.  Neurontin 100 mg by mouth three times per day
7.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
8.  Losartan 20 mg by mouth once per day.
9.  Coumadin (to be held).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  Followup as mentioned above
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in one week.
