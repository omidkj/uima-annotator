EGD

History of Present Illness:
35yo F with poorly controlled T1DM c/b retinopathy, nephropathy,
gastroparesis and distant h/o GI bleed from esophagitis p/w
nausea, vomiting, and melena since yesterday.  Some (~2 cups)
coffee-ground emesis last night per ED, but pt's mother states
there was no coffee-ground emesis.  Some lightheadedness; no
syncope or LOC.  No abdominal pain or fevers.  Pt says she just
woke up last night from sleep nauseous.  Her BGs were in the
300s-400s overnight.  Pt reports not taking her Lantus this AM.

Pt also reports nonproductive cough for several weeks and
non-bloody diarrhea x6 weeks.  No dyspnea.  No urinary symptoms.

In the ED inital vitals were 99.4, 130, 175/104, 16, 97% on 2L.
Pt had a gap metabolic acidosis and received 2L IVF and 8 un
insulin; she was then started on an insulin gtt, 5 un/hr.  Her
N/V improved with zofran and ativan.  She had guaiac-positive,
black stools but refused NG lavage.  Pantoprazole drip was
started.  GI consult ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3095**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) saw the pt and plans to do

EGD ([**2140-4-4**])
Impression: Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus (biopsy)
Food in the stomach body and fundus
Friability and erythema in the whole stomach compatible with
gastritis
Polyps in the stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations: The likely source of bleeding was from a now
healed [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
fundic gland polyps related to PPI use
Likely Barrett's seen in distal esophagus. Will mail biopsy
results in [**2-26**] weeks.
Continue Omeprazole.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 35 year old woman with poorly controlled DM1,
requiring multiple admissions for DKA, usually triggered by
gastroparesis flares, who presented to MICU again with DKA in
the setting of nausea, vomiting, melena, and coffee-ground
emesis.  She did well overall, but needs to set up followup with
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as gastroenterology for potential EGD.

  GI was consulted in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], thought about EGD once pt stable.
she was stable and transferred to floor [**Hospital Unit Name 2974**] night.  took
several days in MICU for intractable nausea/vomiting to resolve.
 now she is taking POs.  Of note, she is on torsemide for dCHF,
which was restarted Saturday night.  At baseline now.  Abdominal
exam benign now and n/v/abdom pain resolved.  Only 1 episode of
coffee ground emesis and melena with gastroparesis flare prior
to admission (melena x1 in ED), but no further symptoms; has had
coffee ground emesis with gastroparesis flares in the past.  Has
had multiple EGDs in the past, though none recent.

# DKA: Blood glucose in 400s with anion gap of 20 on arrival to
ED.  DKA precipitant thought to be dehydration secondary to
gastroenteritis given diarrhea x6 weeks and missed AM glargine
dose.  No evidence of PNA on CXR, no urinary symptoms suggestive
of UTI, UA on presentation showing a few WBCs but
nitrite-negative and no bacteria.  In the ED, the patient
received 2L IVF and 8 units of insulin bolus and was started on
an insulin drip at 5 un/hr.  Given free water deficit of ~1.6L,
patient received 1L 1/2 NS D5W (with 80 mEq KCl) and was further
resuscitated with 1/2 NS.  For nausea, patient had a trial of
PRN IV zofran, IV phenergan, and IV lorazepam without much
success. Patient stated that ativan works well for her at home,
was given 0.5 mg IV q6hrs PRN nausea made her very somnolent and
was therefore changed to 0.25 mg IV q3hrs with good effect.  Pt
was also started on standing IV metoclopramide.  Patient's anion
gap closed on insulin gtt, and D5W drip with KCl was started in
addition to insulin gartt once blood glucose was consistently
<250.  Nausea resolved on [**2140-4-1**], at which time she was
transitioned from insulin drip to subcu insulin and transferred
to the floor.  She is followed by [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient and
may be a candidate for an insulin [**Last Name (LF) 4581**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she is carb counting
at home.  Her glargine was increased to lantus 10units at
bedtime (rather than 4 units [**Hospital1 **]).

# UTI: Her initial UTI showed only few WBCs without
bacteria/nitrites, and repeat UA showed >182 WBC but 6
epithelial cells.  Decision was made to treat, in setting of
intractable nausea/vomiting for days, in case this was a
contributing factor.  Pt was started on 7-day course of PO
nitrofurantoin (pt unable to take PO Bactrim b/c of pill size)
on [**2140-3-31**] and tolerated it well.  She should continue for 2 more
days post discharge.

# Question of Upper GI bleed: Pt reports coffee ground emesis x1
prior to admis
