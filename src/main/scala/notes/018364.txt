Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, MRSA bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. PICC line placement [**11-21**]
2. Sternal wound culture [**11-18**]

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o female s/p recent d/c from [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-6**] following
complicated course involving pericardial tissue AVR and MAZE for
aortic stenosis and refractory afib  [**9-17**], intermittent CHF and
renal failure now being re-admitted for ?sternal cellulitis and
MRSA bacteremia.  Admitted late [**8-17**] for aortic valve repair w/
surgery initially delayed secondary to acute renal failure and
volume overload, treated w/ natrecor. Underwent magna
pericardial tissue AVR for AS and MAZE for afib. Post-op course
c/b recurrent afib and tenous volume status resulting in
intermittent CHF and ARF and several episodes of respiratory
failure requiring intubation.  At one point, pt treated w/
milrinone in [**9-17**] after intubated for respiratory distress and
then extubated on [**10-3**] w/ metabolic alkalosis treated w/ diamox.
 Continued to revert into afib on multiple occasions and thought
to exacerbate CHF.  Labile blood pressures resulting in
hypotension w/ ACEi and bradycardia w/ digoxin.  During
remainder of hospital course, again managed for CHF and resp
failure and ultimately underwent trach and PEG. All told, during
hospital course, diuresed 15 liters negative.

Transferred to [**Hospital **] rehab on [**11-10**] and initially remained
stable. Apparently, spiked fever on [**11-13**] to 103.5 and was noted
to be w/ increased resp distress and WBC also increased. CXR w/
reported b/l infiltrates. Started on Zosyn for ?infiltration but
sputum, blood cultures found positive for MRSA and started on
Vancomycin [**11-16**]. On [**11-17**], c/o substernal CP and noted to have
significant erythema at sternal incision site. Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Past Medical History:
1. Aortic stenosis s/p AVR [**9-17**] as above
2. Presumed diastolic dysfunction
3. Recurrent afib s/p MAZE [**9-17**]
4. Pulmonary HTN
5. Chronic respiratory failure s/p trach
6. s/p PEG
7. type 2 dm
8. CVA [**42**] years ago
9. hypothyroid
10. Chronic renal insuffiency, baseline 1.3

Social History:

etiology of cardiomyopathy per pt and family.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. MRSA bacteremia: 2/2 bottles from OSH + for MRSA. Given
recent bioprosthetic aortic valve [**9-17**], concerns about potential
for endocarditis. Pt also had erythema and pain around site of
sternum. Pt followed by both ID and CT surgery. Started on iv
vanc and rifampin and gent given concerns for endocarditis.
However, blood cultures remained neg [**Hospital 54708**] hospital course.
TTE and TEE both performed which were negative for vegetations.
ID recommended d/c of rifampin and prolonged course of IV
vancomycin x 4 weeks at 1g q 48 hrs. Meanwhile, sternal incision
was cultured w/o significant growth.

1a;)?Sternal wound infection: no evidence of osteo on ct and
evaluated by CT w/o evidence of fluctuance concerning for
abscess. Cultures of deep sternal wound w/ minimal growth.
Recommended wet to dry normal saline dressing changes [**Hospital1 **].

2. Chronic respiratory failure: continued on current vent
settings of SIMV PS.

3. CHF: Continued on low dose Coreg. In addition, pt was felt to
mild overloaded on exam and diuresed w/ IV lasix 80 mg x 2 w/
good response. She will continue w/ lasix 40 mg po bid. She
should have creatinine and weight followed closely.

4. Anemia: Hct remained relatively stable [**Hospital 44644**] hospital course
w/ transfusion 1 unit prbc.

5. CRI: creatinine stable throughout hospital course.

6. AFib: rate controlled w/ coreg and continued on
anti-coagulation w/ coumadin.

7. Access: new RUE PICC placed on [**11-20**] for delivery iv abx.

8. Rash: Macular erythematous rash thought secondary to rifampin
that was d/c'd.
