Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with past medical history of alcohol abuse
(quit 2 months ago), hypertension, depression, spinal stenosis
and ?CHF who was admitted to Neurosurgery from an OSH on
[**2196-9-2**] after falling down [**2-12**] stair steps. Patient
had yelled out while falling and woke up when his wife came to
him. Did lose consciousness, however, and was found to have
subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages on CT head at OSH. The
patient initially complained of headache at the OSH and upon
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. He has a history of imbalance/vertigo and
essential tremor being worked up by Neurology at the OSH as an
outpatient.
.
Neurosurgery felt the hemorrhages were not operable so the
patient was managed medically with Mannitol in the TICU. His
hospital course has been complicated by increasing cerebral
edema on serial CT scans although the most recent CT scan
([**2196-9-9**]) was stable. On admission and per TICU notes, he had
been able to answer questions initially but became
intermittently agitated and lethargic as his hospital course
progressed.  Over the last weekend of discharge he was
responsive to light touch but has been non verbal for at least
the last 10 days of his admission.  He did have a few episodes
of increased right shoulder twitching which resolved with
lorazepam 0.5mg X1-2 (ordered by Neurosurgery after evaluating
the patient). The patient also developed fevers and leukocytosis
during his hospital stay. Neurosurgery did not feel that it was
secondary to the intracerebral bleed.  One blood culture of five
sets subsequently grew out coagulase negative staph.  Infectious
Disease was consulted and the patient started on Vancomycin
[**2196-9-7**] evening. There is question as to whether the blood
culture X1 was due to contamination vs. a true infection. His
left subclavian appears clean and TTE did not show any
vegetations (although not ordered specifically to evaluate for
endocarditis).
Patient also had some hypernatremia and intermittent tachypnea.
ABG revealed respiratory alkalosis.  Hypernatremia improved with
adjustment of free water boluses.  Echo showed mild impairment
in systolic function and basal hypokinesis, so he was
intermittently given lasix.
.
ROS: Remains unable to obtain. Also had right shoulder twitching
concerning for possible seizure activity.

Pertinent Results:
[**9-2**] Echo: Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is
moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction suggested with basal inferior hypokinesis. No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased
stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is suggested. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Head CT at OSH ([**2196-9-2**]): At the outside hospital he had a CT of
his head that showed bilateral contusions, subarachnoid,
epidural. There was no shift. Neck CT was negative.
.
Head CT upon admission ([**2196-9-2**]): increased size of left
frontal/temporal hemorrhagic contusions with surrounding edema
and local mass effect, but no midline shift. 5mm right lateral
convex SDH, more apparent than on prior study. Increased SAH
with
more blood in the ambient cisterns stable 2x1cm left temporal
tip
epidural hematoma.
.
[**9-2**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Progression of intraparenchymal
hemorrhages in the right frontal and temporal lobes. Stable left
vertex intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is  local right-sided
mass effect, but no midline shift 2. New right convexity and
tentorial subdural hematoma.
3. Increased subarachnoid blood, particularly within the ambient
cist
