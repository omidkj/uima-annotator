Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
74 yo F with PMH significant for pancreatic CA s/p Whipple's
procedure and chemotherapy, HTN, HLD, CKD, DM 2, recurrent C.
diff and UTI, and recent left femur fracture, presents with
shortness of breath and tachycardia, found to have pulmonary
embolism and atrial flutter with RVR.
.
Patient reports that she was experiencing shortness of breath
this AM at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and was noted to be tachypneic up to
the 30s. Denied chest pain, chest pressure, diaphoresis,
vomiting, syncope. Otherwise, reports diarrhea from C. diff,
increased upper extremity edema over the past 2 days, and
worsening wheeze.
.
Of note, patient was found to have a non-occlusive left
popliteal DVT on LENI in [**2157-5-29**]. Lovenox and IVC filter were
recommended and patient declined both. On [**2157-7-16**], she syncopized
and sustained a fall from standing height at rehab, resulting in
left oblique displaced comminuted midshaft femur fracture. This
was repaired at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2157-7-20**] when she underwent a retrograde
femoral nail for left femur fracture. Post-operatively, patient
was discharged on prophylaxis dose of lovenox 40 mg/0.4 ml sc
qd.
.
Two day prior to admission, patient noted increased swelling in
her upper extemities. Also reports having a repeat LENI done of
the left leg which showed disappearance of the previously noted
DVT.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.2 141 126/87 24 98% 4L Nasal
Cannula. EKG showed A-flutter and she was given an adenosine
challenge. Received IV diltiazem (5 mg x 3) and then diltiazem
gtt, which was stopped after the CTA showed PE. CT head was
performed to ruled out metastasis which was negative. She was
guaiac negative and started on heparin gtt. Labs were notable
for BNP 7400, troponin 0.08, Cr 1.4 (baseline 1.7), positive UA,
and patient was given vancomycin + zosyn. Per report, bedside
echo did not show RV collapse. On transfer, VS were HR 141 BP
109/71 RR 16 O2sat 97% 3L (NC).
.
On the floor, patient was tachypneic and in slight distress.
Denied chest pain however does report wheezing and shortness of
breath.

Past Medical History:
 - Pancreatitis in [**2156-3-15**] at [**Hospital1 112**]. MRI/MRCP on [**2156-9-29**]
showed a 2 cm cystic mass of the pancreatic head with
obstruction of the pancreatic and bile ducts. She underwent ERCP

on [**2156-10-4**] and a stent was placed. CEA was 32.8 on [**2156-10-5**].
Brushing at the time of ERCP was suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
She had an EUS on [**2156-11-8**] and FNA biopsy revealed malignant
cells consistent with adenocarcinoma. Staging CT on [**2156-11-13**]
revealed a 1.9 cm x 1.6 cm hypoattenuating pancreatic head mass
with post-obstructive pancreatic ductal dilatation to 6mm. No
evidence of local, hepatic or vascular invasion; scattered
celiac axis and porta hepatis LNs measuring up to 1.2 cm. She
was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 **] surgery service and had
Whipple surgery on [**2156-12-2**]. She had stayed in Rehab until the

beginning of [**2157-1-12**] and then shortly after she was discharged
from rehab, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2157-1-28**] for C diff, UTI
and acute renal failure.
