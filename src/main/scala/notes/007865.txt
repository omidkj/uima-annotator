Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old gentleman
with known history of aortic stenosis admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization prior to
aortic valve replacement.  He had been followed by his
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] for the last several years,
but recently had increasing symptoms of shortness of breath
and dyspnea on exertion.  An echocardiogram from [**Month (only) 205**] of this
year showed aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.4
cm squared with a peak gradient of 96.  Left ventricular
ejection fraction was estimated at 60%.  They also had mild
mitral regurgitation.  Cardiac catheterization revealed left
ventricular ejection fraction of 65%, no coronary artery
disease, severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of
0.66.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Bladder cancer.
2. Prostate cancer status post x-ray treatment.
3. COPD.
4. Perforated ulcer status post ulcer surgery.
5. Status post bowel resection in [**2136**].
6. Atrial fibrillation.
7. Aortic stenosis.
8. Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Digitek 125 mcg p.o. q.d.
2. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Verapamil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Albuterol two puffs q.i.d.
5. Atrovent two puffs q.i.d.
6. Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
7. Axid 150 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of symptoms upon admission was
unremarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a heavy smoker for many
years, but quit 14 years prior to admission.  The patient
does admit to drinking four alcoholic beverages per day, and
he lives with his wife.

LABORATORY VALUES UPON ADMISSION:  Unremarkable.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2144-9-8**], where he underwent an aortic valve replacement by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  He received a 23 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
pericardial valve.  Please see operative note for full
details of operative procedures and events in the operating
room.

Patient was transported from the operating room to the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good condition intubated on
mechanical ventilator and on IV Neo-Synephrine drip.

Postoperative day one, he was atrially paced for some
bradycardia.  He was on Neo-Synephrine and propofol for
sedation and dopamine was started on postoperative day two,
[**9-10**].  Later on that day on [**9-11**], the
patient was weaned from mechanical ventilator, and was
successfully extubated.  He required a fair amount of
pulmonary toilet, and did have a lot of respiratory
secretions and remained rhonchorous by examination.  He was
begun with gentle diuresis and was started on Lopressor.  His
Neo-Synephrine had been weaned off.

The following day, [**9-13**], the patient did have an
episode of atrial flutter and again had another episode of
atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation the following day on
[**9-14**].  This was treated with IV amiodarone as well
as IV diltiazem drip for rate control, and he ultimately
converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  His IV amiodarone was
converted to p.o. over the next couple of days.  On [**9-14**], the patient also underwent bronchoscopy for copious
secretions and large amounts of thick tan sputum was
suctioned bilaterally.

Patient continued to have large amounts of secretions and
difficulty clearing them.  He had been started on
levofloxacin empirically for respiratory secretions.  Sputum
specimen was sent on [**9-15**], which ultimately grew
out Klebsiella pneumonia for which he was ultimately placed
on Zosyn at the recommendation of the Infectious Disease
Service.  Subsequent blood and urine cultures have been
negative to date.

Patient was ultimately reintubated on postoperative day nine,
[**9-17**] due to increased work of breathing.  He also
had another episode of atrial fibrillation and flutter at
that time for which he received another bolus IV dose of
amiodarone and ultimately converted back to normal sinus
rhythm.

On [**2144-9-18**], it was evident that the patient would
not wean easily from mechanical ventilator.  He remained with
copious secretions and with difficulty clearing those on his
own.  He underwent placement of a percutaneous tracheostomy
as well as bronchoscopy on [**2144-9-18**].  This was
performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Patient tolerated the
procedure well.  It was felt that the patient should not have
surgically placed gastrostomy tube for continued feeding
since he has had previous surgery on his stomach as well as
intermittent elevated white blood cell counts.  Therefore,
Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed into his stomach and he was
begun on tube feeds at that time, which he has been
tolerating well.

Infectious Disease consult was also obtained on [**2144-9-18**] for continued elevated white blood cell count as well as
Klebsiella in his sputum.  Repeat cultures were sent.  Repeat
sputum cultures ultimately were negative with the exception
with oral flora.  Blood cultures and urine have also remained
negative.  It was the Infectious Disease Service
recommendation to continue Zosyn for a two week course to
treat this Klebsiella in his sputum.  The patient was
ultimately weaned off vasoactive drips and has remained
hemodynamically stable.  Has also remained in normal sinus
rhythm on oral amiodarone.

Patient has tolerated decreasing levels of ventilatory
support, being placed on CPAP with decreasing levels of
pressure support.  Patient has tolerated intermittent periods
of being off the ventilator with oxygen being delivered via
tracheostomy collar.  He occasionally becomes tachypneic
after a couple of hours and gets placed back on ventilator
support to rest.

It was felt that the patient has been hemodynamically stable
on decreasing amounts of ventilatory support and ready to be
transferred to a rehabilitation facility to assist with
ultimate ventilator weaning and increased activity and
physical therapy.

Condition today on [**2144-9-22**] is as follows:  Patient
is afebrile with a temperature of 98.0.  He is in normal
sinus rhythm with a rate of 80.  His blood pressure is
127/53.  His oxygen saturation is 99% on CPAP with 8 of
pressure support and 40% FIO2.  Neurologically, the patient
appears to be intact and following commands albeit
intermittently.  He does move all extremities with equal
strength bilaterally.  Respiratory status:  He remains with
coarse bilateral breath sounds and fair amount of secretions.
His cardiac examination is regular, rate, and rhythm.  His
abdomen is slightly distended, soft, and nontender.  His
extremities are warm with trace to 1+ peripheral edema.

On the evening of [**9-22**], the patient was noted to
have an episode of hemoptysis.  Blood was suctioned from his
endotracheal tube.  Laboratories were sent at that time to
evaluate abnormal coagulation factors and these were all
normal.  Most recent laboratory values on this patient are
from [**9-22**].  He has white blood cell count of 20.2,
hematocrit of 31.6, and platelet count of 186,000.  He has a
sodium of 137, potassium 4.3, chloride 106, CO2 27, BUN 21,
creatinine 0.5.  His hematocrit at 8 p.m. which was rechecked
after the episode of hemoptysis is 32.3.  His prothrombin
time also at 8 p.m. is 12.0 with an INR of 1.0 and a PTT of
27.8.  He also has a platelet count of 192,000.  Most recent
blood gas is also from 8 p.m. on [**9-22**], which is
7.35, pCO2 52, with a pAO2 of 101.

Most recent chest x-ray reveals bibasilar atelectasis with a
small bilateral pleural effusions and no congestive heart
failure.
