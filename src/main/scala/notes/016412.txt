Note:  This is a continuing of a prior discharge summary from
[**2105-2-15**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent PEG tube placement on
[**2-16**] without complications.  The patient's tube feeds
were resumed via the PEG tube on [**2-17**] and were well
tolerated without residual.

The patient has remained afebrile on empiric broad-spectrum
antibiotics for a culture-negative left lower lobe pneumonia.
The current plan is to complete a three-week course of
Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin for empiric coverage.  The
patient has continued with copious thick sputum requiring
frequent suctioning.

A repeat chest x-ray on [**2-16**] demonstrated stable pleural
effusions and continued left lower lobe pneumonia with left
lower lobe collapse.  A further evaluation with a bedside
ultrasound was without evidence of significant pleural
effusion, and the planned thoracentesis (therapeutic and
diagnostic) was deferred.

Incidentally on ultrasound, the diaphragms were noted with
minimal excursion with inspiration.  Esophageal balloon study
to further evaluate for diaphragm paralysis is pending at the
time of dictation.

Multiple attempts to wean the patient from ventilation have
been unsuccessful likely secondary to copious sputum
production with mucous plugging and concomitant diaphragm
paralysis.  The patient's oxygenation and ventilation have
remained stable on pressure support ranging from 15 to 20,
PEEP of 5, FIO2 40%.

The patient has continued on Flagyl for C-difficile colitis
to complete a 14-day course.  The patient has remained
oliguric with an average urine output of 30 cc/hr with
continued normal renal function.  The patient also continues
to be in atrial fibrillation, adequately rate controlled on
Metoprolol 150 mg t.i.d.  The patient's hematocrit has
remained stable without further need for transfusion.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable, afebrile, vent dependent
with tracheostomy requiring frequent suctioning for copious
sputum.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Left lower lobe pneumonia (culture negative), ventilator
dependent with tracheostomy.
2.  C-difficile colitis.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Spinal stenosis.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.
7.  Status post cerebrovascular accident with right occipital
and bilateral thalamic infarcts.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lansoprazole 30 mg per PEG tube q.d.,
Aspirin 325 mg per PEG tube q.d., Colace 150 mg/15 ml liquid
per PEG tube b.i.d., Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. (goal INR [**12-29**]
for atrial fibrillation), Lovenox 60 mg subcue b.i.d.,
Levofloxacin 250 mg tab per PEG tube q.d. to complete a
3-week course (5 days remaining), Ceftazidime 1 g IV q.12
hours (to complete a 3-week course, 5 day remaining), Flagyl
500 mg tab per PEG tube t.i.d. (to complete a 14-day course,
7 days remaining), Metoprolol 150 mg per PEG tube t.i.d.,
Miconazole powder to be applied t.i.d. for abdominal fungal
rash, Ativan 1-2 mg subcue q.4 hours as needed for agitation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to be discharged to
[**Hospital 4820**] rehabilitation for chronic ventilation and
intravenous antibiotics.
