Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-12-6**] Four Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending,
with saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, obtuse marginal and PDA

History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year old female with known history of coronary
disease and multiple medical issues. She presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] with acute pulmonary edema requiring intubation. Her
pulmonary status gradually improved with diuresis and she was
eventually extubated without further complication. She underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed 60% distal left main
lesion, 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending, totally
occluded circumflex and 80% stenosis of the right coronary
artery. LV gram was notable for an LVEF of 40%. Given the above
findings, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical
intervention. On admission, she was pain free without
respiratory distress.

[**2154-12-4**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with infero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2154-12-6**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesia of the apex as well as the apical and mid
portions of the inferior wall.. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.

POST BYPASS
1. Patient is being AV paced and receving an infusion of
phenylephrine and epinephrine.
2. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
3. Aorta intact post decannulation.

Final Report
STUDY: AP chest, [**2154-12-8**].

HISTORY: Status post removal of chest tube. Evaluate for
pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from [**2154-12-6**].

The endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, feeding tube, and
chest tubes have
been removed. Study is somewhat suboptimal due to technique,
however, no
pneumothoraces are seen. There is some atelectasis at the left
base.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. She was started on
Bactrim for a positive urinalysis which eventually grew out
Klebseilla pneumoniae and Citrobacter. She was also seen by the
wound service given her left lower extremity ulcers. There was
no evidence of cellulitis, and she required only local wound
care measures. Preoperative workup was otherwise uneventful and
she was cleared for surgery. She remained symptom-free on
medical therapy.

On [**12-6**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see separate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, she was
brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours,
she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. She experienced rapid atrial fibrillation which was
initially treated with Amiodarone and beta blockade, along with
electrolyte replacement. IV Amiodarone was changed to po dosing
and her rhythm  converted to sinus. She otherwise maintained
stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative
day three.  Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation and
treatment resumed. Wound [**Name8 (MD) **] RN continued to follow
Ms.[**Known lastname 68085**] left lower extremity ulcer. She continued to
progress and she was ready for discharge to rehab on POD# 4. All
follow up appointments were advised.
