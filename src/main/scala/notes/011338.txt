CT Head [**8-4**]
  Approximately 50% evacuation of chronic right subdural
hematoma/hygroma, with decreased leftward subfalcine herniation
to 9 mm. New hyperdensity along the superoposterior aspect of
the collection may represent surgical changes or acute
hemorrhage.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2186-8-7**] prelim
No significant change in the size of the hypodense collection
overlying the right hemispheric convexity, thought to be a
combination of hygroma and chronic SDH. There is, however,
apparent increased effacement of right
hemispheric sulci and slight increased compression of the right
lateral
ventricle. No change in degree of entrapment of the left lateral
ventricle. Unchanged leftward shift of normally midline
structures. No central herniation. No new intracranial
hemorrhage or acute large vascular
territorial infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted from clinic to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2186-8-2**] for
further management.  He underwent burr whole evacuation of the
right subdural  on [**2186-8-3**].  Please review dictated operative
report for details.  He tolerated the procedure well and was
extubated and transferred to ICU over night.

His ICU stay was uncomplicated. On Post operative day one a CT
was ordered and reviewed which showed a decrease in the SDH, but
some residual pneumocephalus.  He remained clinically stable and
was transferred to the floor. His left sided weakness did
improve post operatively and he continued to do well on the
floor.

Physical Therapy and Occupational therapy evaluated the patient
for return back to the [**Hospital3 **]. On [**8-7**], patient remained
stable, repeat head CT was done which showed stable midline
shift and no new hemorrhage. He was discharged to rehab on [**8-7**]
