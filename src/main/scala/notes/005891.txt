Please see a previous dictation. She left against medical

shortness of breath with an O2 requirement. She had completed
a 10-day course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin at home. She

being sharp. She became more tachypneic and short of breath.
Her saturations were 94% on room air at the outside hospital.
At the outside hospital she also had a chest x-ray which
showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. There was concern for a
pulmonary embolism, so she was started on a heparin drip and
transferred over to the [**Hospital1 **] for further management.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 **], she was saturating at 98% on 2 liters
of nasal cannula. She denied any nausea, vomiting,

Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed an opacity of
right lower lobe. A CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism
and had a right lung consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pneumonia: Patient was initially admitted
for rule out pulmonary embolism and started on a heparin drip
per the outside hospital. She had a CT angiogram at the [**Hospital1 **]
which was consistent with a right lower lobe consolidation
with a small pleural effusion. Otherwise, there was no
evidence of pulmonary embolism. The heparin drip was stopped.
Her symptoms resolved with aggressive pulmonary toilet and
physical therapy. Her O2 saturations had improved, and she
was saturating between 96% and 97% on room air at the time of
her discharge status. She was given O2 nasal cannula
periodically to keep her saturations greater than 96%. She
