History of Present Illness:
This 82 year old  Russian speaking female with known critical
aortic stenosis was admitted after a syncopal episode today
while at a museum. She was with her daughter and family friend,
she felt slightly dizzy and then had episode of loss of
consciousness where she fell into the arms of the family. There
was no trauma or head injury. The physician family friend
thought the patient was pulseless so she initiated CPR, but the
pt regained a pulse and consciousness within ~15 seconds. Pt
also had bowel and bladder incontinence during this episode.

Pertinent Results:
Prebypass
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results on [**2192-11-27**] at 1000 am.
Post bypass
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Bioprosthetic
valve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets move well and the
valve appears well seated. There is no aortic insufficiency.
Peak gradient across the valve is 6 mm Hg . There is moderate
mitral regurgitation. There is moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Aorta intact post decannulation. The left atrial appendage has
been ligated.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient consented to surgery at this time, having refused in
[**Month (only) 359**] when initially seen by cardiac Surgery.Ms. [**Known lastname 5304**] was
taken to the Operating Room and underwent Aortic Valve
Replacement (#23mm Pericardial)/Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x
1(Saphenous vein grafted to Right Coronary Artery)/Suture
ligation of Left Atrial Appendage/MAZE procedure.Cardiopulmonary
Bypass time= 139 minutes. Cross clamp time= 110 minutes. Please
refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative report for further details.

 She weaned from bypass on Propofol and was transferred to the
CVICU. She awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
difficulty. Beta-blocker and Amiodarone was initiated. Transient
junctional rhythm occurred and beta blocker was was temporarily
discontinued. Low dose Amiodarone was continued per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 171**].
POD#1  she was oliguric and had a metabolic acidosis which
required large volume resuscitation along with a Sodium
Bicarbonate drip. The acidosis resolved and she continued to
progress. The right CT continued to have copious drainage and wa
left in after mediastinal tubes and pacing wires were removed.
Low dose B-Blocker was reinstated and tolerated well. Dosing was
optimized for rate control.

 Anticoagulation was resumed on POD#3 with Coumadin. Her rhythm
went back into Atrial Fibrillation and beta blocker was
increased.. POD#4 she was transferred to the step down unit for
further monitoring. Physical therapy was consulted for
evaluation and assesment. The CT continued to produce 2 liters
daily and a CXR revealed a trapped right lowere lobe.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted. The CT was clamped for 24 hours and
serial CXRs revealed filling of the basilar space with fluid,
but no significant accumulation or pneumothorax.  The CT was
then opened, drained 50cc and removed.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5306**] has agreed to follow and manage Coumadin as before,
with an INR goal of [**2-7**]. Follow up with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 171**],
[**Name5 (PTitle) 5306**] and [**Doctor Last Name **] were arranged as well as the wound
clinic here.

A PA and lateral film demonstarted....

She was therapeutic on Coumadin and ready for discharge.
Arrangements were made for follow up, Coumadin will be
controlled by her primary care physician.
