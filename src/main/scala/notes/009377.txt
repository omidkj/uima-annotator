History of Present Illness:
35 F yo with history of narcotic use, transfered from [**Hospital 91429**]
hospital for respiratory failure and hypotension.
.
She initially presented there on [**8-15**] with 1 week of dyspnea,
new somnolence and a reported 35-60 lb weight loss over 6 month.
Found to have spontaneous ride sided tension pneumothorax at
admission.  Had R anterior and posterior chest tubes inserted on
[**8-15**].  At admission also stated to have severe metabolic
acidosis with multiple electrolyte abnormalities and was
severely malnourished.
.
At admsision, she was noted to have a Hct of 22 and was
transfused 5 Units to 31 today.  She was transfused 3 units on
[**8-15**] and 2 units [**8-18**].
.

calf (family states sleeps in chair and has been present for a
year).  On  [**8-17**] anterior chest tube removed and on [**8-18**]
posterior chest tube out and RIJ inserted after she began to
vomit.  CT scan at that time showed large b/l pulmonary emboli
and hepatosplenomegally.  [**8-19**] notes to have right posterior
draining brown foul smelling fluid.

CXR [**2130-8-20**]:
The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. The right internal
jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The NG tube tip is
in the stomach. Right apical pneumothorax is small. There are
widespread consolidations seen. The left lung is almost entirely
obscured by consolidation with air bronchogram, most likely
consistent with large infectious process. On the right, there
are focal consolidations with some lucencies that might
represent cavitary lesions and should be correlated with
cross-sectional imaging. Bilateral pleural effusions are most
likely present.

TTE [**2130-8-21**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A
patent foramen ovale is present. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ven
