Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement ([**5-8**]).

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 yo man with history of severe COPD s/p tracheostomy
on continuous home 02 who presents with 2-3 days of worsened
dyspnea and thicker respiratory secretions.  He has a
complicated pulmonary history with tracheomalacia s/p tracheal
stent placement and subsequent removal, history of MRSA and
resistant pseudomonas pneumonia, chronically elevated right
hemidiaphragm, chronic copious secretions and right and left
base atelectasis. PMHx also notable for steroid induced DM and
osteoporosis with subsequent vertebral fracture, kyphosis and
chronic back pain. He had been doing well from a respiratory
standpoint until recently. He had seen his pulmonologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4507**] in clinic on [**4-24**], was steadily improving and tapering
his oxygen, requiring as little as 1L with rest at 3L with
exertion. At that time his steroids were decreased from 20mg
daily to 10mg alternating with 20mg.  He does not endorse sick
contacts, but states " I live in a nursing home, everybody's
sick." Otherwise no change in medications.  Symptoms of
increased dyspnea associated with low 02 sats, he checked on his
own, noted some levels to as low as the high 70s.  He always has
lots of secretions, but noted lately they were thicker and
harder to cough up. Unsure if he has had fevers or chills, but
has had night sweats for the past several weeks. He has been
using his nebulizers more frequently.  Also reports chest
tightness with episodes of respiratory distress, resolves with
nebulizers.  Complaining of exacerbation of chronic low back
pain, occasional abd pain, improving with eating, and increased
lower extremity edema with R>L lower extremity erythema.
.
Reported VS at NH: VS 98.1 RR32 88/65 98% NRB with BS 177.
Received some IVF prior to transfer. In ED was 99.2 120 118/80
28 97% NRB, improved to 92% on 4L HR 110 100/70 RR 26 at time of
transfer to ICU.  Labs were notable only for a left shifted WBC.
 CXR showed old LLL collapse with partial new RLL collapse.  He
received 1 dose of vancomycin in the ED, received 300 cc IVF
with 850 cc UOP.  ECG showed sinus tach.  He had a trop of 0.02
with MBI 9.1, CK 219 MB 20. Cardiology was called and
recommended trending enzymes, giving aspirin, no heparin.  There
was concern for a PE in the ED due to patient's tachycardia, but
as he was unable to lay flat due to respiratory distress the
decision regarding treatment and work up was left to the
accepting team.
.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring in the
setting of respiratory distress with tachycardia and need for
frequent suctioning.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient complained mainly of [**8-19**] back pain as
well as shortness of breath as described above.  He denied HA,
no change in appetite/PO intake. Endorses occasional heart burn
and RUQ pain, improved with meals. Constipation. No melena or
hematochezia.  Otherwise ROS negative.

Imaging Studies:

Chest x-ray PA and lateral ([**5-7**]):
1. Worsening right lung atelectasis with collapse of right
middle and right lower lobes.
2. Improving atelectasis left lower lobe.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram ([**5-8**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular
septal defect. with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2124-6-9**], there is now moderate pulmonary hypertension detected.
