Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheobronchomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
55 year old Female with history of COPD, tracheomalacia,
presenting with shortness of breath. Patient being worked up
with new diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia; had a bronchoscopy
[**8-13**]. Notes slightly worsened shortness of breath and fatigue
since bronchoscopy. Reports last feeling breathing at baseline 3
days prior to admission. Then developed a few days of
progressive shortness of breath while at home. Significant
worsening the night before admission. At 930pm patient's father
remarked that she looked unwell and short of breath; thus
presented to ED at an outside hospital. At baseline gets
dyspneic with walking ~[**10-2**] feet; able to ascend stairs but
very slowly. Reports even more dyspnea with exertion since
bronchoscopy on [**8-13**]. Has thus been relatively inactive. + chest
pain, pleuritic and with coughing only, x months. Pain
substernal with separate pain in L mid back. Cough also worsened
in last few days, feels productive though she has been unable to
cough anything up. No fevers/chills.

At OSH on [**Hospital3 4298**], received nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV
x 3 doses, and azithromycin with concern of COPD flare.
Medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] given care with IP here.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals 98.5 80 160/81 20 100% on bipap
50%. CXR with low lung volumes, difficult to interpret if
infiltrate present. Lactate up at 7. Received zosyn for
pneumonia coverage, and 2 L NS. Tachycardic to 120s, not
responding to fluids, but with stable BPs > 130. Also noted to
have anisocoria in ED, likely related to neb exposure.

On ROS, positives as above. No abd pain, N/V, diarrhea, dysuria,
skin infections or rashes/lesions.


Past Medical History:
- COPD per past notes, though patient nonsmoker and denies
history of COPD/emphysema or chronic bronchitis or past asthma;
no history of breathing difficulties prior to [**2198-4-13**]
- TBM as above; per patient plan for pulm rehab x months with
future stenting
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- ?anaphylactic reaction in [**2198-4-13**] - patient recalls this
was onset of respiratory symptoms leading to diagnosis of TBM
- Numerous right hand surgeries s/p R hand trauma
- Cholecystectomy
- Appendectomy
- Tonsillectomy
- Back surgery (unclear procedure)
- Hyperglycemia in setting of steroids


Social History:
Denies ETOH, Tobacco ever. Lives with mother, father, and
brother.

Family History:
Mother with DM and HTN. Father with HTN. Grandfather had some
type of blood clot

EKG [**8-27**]: Sinus tachycardia. Baseline artifact is present.
Ventricular ectopy. Left atrial abnormality.

cxr [**8-27**]: IMPRESSION: Heart appears enlarged. Low lung volumes.

B/L LENIs [**8-27**]: 1. No deep venous thrombosis in bilateral lower
extremities. 2. Subcutaneous edema.

TTE [**8-28**]: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved left ventricular
function. Possible right ventricular hypokinesis, but image
quality is limited. At least borderline pulmonary hypertension.


V/Q SCAN [**8-28**]: IMPRESSION: Normal ventilation/perfusion scan.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 55F with COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, admitted to
the general medicine service with respiratory distress; BiPAP
requirement, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.

# Respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia.
Patient with baseline significant TBM and possible additional
type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma (unclear
etiology and time course of TBM.) Also of note is her recent
steroid use for TBM. The initial differential diagnosis included
COPD exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present),
pneumonia, PE and volume overload. There was no definitive
positive culture data. Also metabolic acidosis from lactate as
below likely to be contributing, as patient with poor
respiratory reserve and unlikely to be able to satisfactorilly
compensate from respiratory standpoint. Pt initially required
BIPAP, but this was discontinued on hospital day 3, and only
required PRN overnight. Pt was placed empirically on heparin gtt
pending further w/u for PE. LENIs were found to be negative for
DVT and V/Q scan did not show any abnormalities. Therefore
heparin gtt was discontinued. Pt continued to be unable to
produce sputum for cultures. Viral swabs were performed which
were negative for viral antigens. Urine legionella antigen was
also negative. Pt was initially treated empirically with
vancomycin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin (day [**2202-12-23**]) and a PICC
line was placed on HD3. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone were
discontinued on [**8-29**], and she was continued only on azithromycin
(5 day course completed [**2198-9-1**]) as she had no white count and
was afebrile. Patient was also treated for fluid overload with
boluses of IV Lasix with improvement in her respiratory
function. TTE was also performed to evaluate cardiac function
which demonstrated a normal LVEF with LVH suggestive of
diastolic failure.  Anxiety is likely a large component in her
respiratory distress, and she received ativan as needed for
anxiety/shortness of breath (and this should be considered
before immediately resorting to nebs). PPI was increased for
GERD as possible etiology of TBM and/or cough.  She was on
steroids, which were tapered rapidly. She was on 10mg Prednisone
in-house.  On the floor, patient's respiratory status remained
stable with continued cough.

# Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
Patient had a bedside limited sleep study which showed findings
consistent with obstructive sleep apnea.  Sleep disorder team
arranged for patient to receive a CPAP machine at home on
discharge, and arranged for supplemental nighttime oxygen to be
delivered to the patient's house for use until CPAP machine
delivery.

# Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF:
New diagnosis on TTE. On beta-blocker. ACEi/[**Last Name (un) **] not started (in
light of allergy to lisinopril). Lipid panel showed elevated
lipids and Zocor was increased in dose prior to discharge.
Lasix 40mg daily was given in-house but patient was not
discharged with Lasix as she was felt to be euvolemic.  She was
instructed to follow up as outpatient for possible initiation of
Lasix as needed.

# Lactic Acidosis
Elevated lactate of 3.1. Pt was not hypotensive, though
tachyca
