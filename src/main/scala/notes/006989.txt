Chief Complaint:
L-sided weakness, falling, dysarthria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo M with h/o metastatic inoperable NSCLC
s/p chemo and radiation who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after
developing L-sided weakness and falling when attempting to rise
from a chair around 10:30pm on [**2109-8-12**].  His wife states that he
had developed difficulty speaking, a left-sided forehead sparing
facial droop prior to falling.  Mr [**Known lastname **] was diagnosed with
NSCLC approximately 1 year ago and two metastatic brain lesions
were found in [**Month (only) 216**] (one R thalamic lesion and one R temporal
lesion).  Upon falling, Mr [**Known lastname **] was taken to [**Hospital6 50929**], where he was found to have bleeding of the R thalamic
metastatic brain lesion with significant intraventricular
extension.

Mr [**Known lastname **] notes that he has experienced intermittent vertigo for
the past several months, often experienced when standing, but
denies lightheadedness.  He also notes veering to the left when
he walks for the past several months.  The pt states that he has
fallen several times over the past 1-2 years -- so many times
that he has lost count.  He also states that he has hit his head
on multiple occasions when he has fallen.  Prior to these falls,
the pt had a h/o  head trauma with multiple concussions (w/o
loss
of consciousness) as a boxer from ages 11 to 29.  The pt also
has
a 90 pack year smoking history.

The pt denies any diplopia, blurring of vision, or other changes
in his vision.  He endorses mild retro-orbital HA, but denies
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting , and diarrhea.  He denies any
pain, numbness, or tingling, but acknowledges weakness of his L
side.


Past Medical History:
-NSCLC s/p chemo and radiation (see HPI)
-DM
-Glaucoma
-s/p b/l cataract surgery
-Lupus
-Peripheral artery disease


Social History:
The pt lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) **].  He worked for most of his
life
as a bricklayer, and retired approximately 10 years ago.  He
spent much of his childhood boxing, from the ages of 11 to 29.

He states that he drank heavily for approximately 20-25 years,
about a quart of whiskey a day.  Pt smoked about 1.5 PPD for 59
years.  He quit one year ago when he was diagnosed with NSCLC.


Family History:
No known family history of malignancy.

HEAD CT [**8-13**]
1. Stable right intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Stable
intraventricular
extension of hemorrhage.
2. Stable vasogenic edema within the right temporoparietal lobe.


HEAD CT [**8-14**]
1. Unchanged right hemispheric parenchymal hemorrhages at the
site of known masses, with stable degree of intraventricular
extension of the hemorrhage.
3. Stable asymmetric dilatation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
right lateral
ventricle at the level of the ventricular atrium.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo M with h/o metastatic inoperable NSCLC
s/p chemo and radiation who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after
developing L-sided weakness and falling when attempting to rise
from a chair around 10:30pm on [**2109-8-12**].

He was found to have intraparenchymal hemorrhage into a right
thalamic metastases.
Another CT scan on [**8-14**] was performed to view if there was any
change in his hemorrhage which showed unchanged right
hemispheric parenchymal hemorrhages at the site of known masses,
with stable degree of intraventricular extension of the
hemorrhage. There was stable asymmetric dilatation of the
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle at the level of the
ventricular atrium.

He was seen by speech and swallow as there were concerns about
his ability to swallow.  There evaluation showed aspiration with
thin liquids and prolonged mastication with mild-moderate
residue with regular solid. They recommended him for PO diet of
nectar-thick liquids and soft solids and that medications should
be take whole with
