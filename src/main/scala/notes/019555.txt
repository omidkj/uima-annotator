Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:

Aortic Valve Replacement


History of Present Illness:
71 year old patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29117**] (PCP) and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
(neurology) with a progressive decline in activity tolerance,
dyspnea on exertion and severe aortic regurgitation referred for
right and
left heart catheterization prior to AVR.
Regarding his AI, in [**2110**] he was quite active and had very
little DOE. Over the past two years, he has noticed a
significant decline in his exercise tolerance along with
fatigue. Four years ago he was able to walk a mile, lately he
has not been able to walk 20 feet due to sob. He was recently
started on lasix 1-2 weeks prior and he was able to walk from
the garage to the hospital without difficulty, approximatley 50
feet. Thus has improved his symptoms but not has resolved it.
Has noticed worsening LE edema in past 2-3 months. Gained 90
pounds over past 12 months per his wife. Also has 2 pillow
orthopnea and +PND. Denies syncope, presyncope, palpitations,
cp.
Echo in [**2110**] showed [**12-8**] + AI with preserved EF and normal LV
size. However recent echo shows severe AI.
In cath today, his coronary arteries were found to be normal. He
was found to be in heart failure when found to have a RVSP: 82
(nml < 35) and PCWP of 40 (nml < 12). He received 40 mg of IV
lasix in cath lab with 1400 cc output. He was also started on a
nitro gtt due to elevated BPs. Noted to have oozing from site as
well. CT surgery was consulted in cath lab and are planning for
AVR Monday.
.
On the floor patient feels well. He denies complaints at this
time.

Final Report
HISTORY: Left effusion, to evaluate for change.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-18**], the central
catheter has been removed. Substantial enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette persists without definite vascular
congestion. The elevated pleural line seen previously is not
definitely appreciated on the current study.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: PFO is present.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Severely dilated LV cavity. Normal
regional LV systolic function. Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Aortic leaflet
prolapse. AR vena contracta is >0.6cm. Severe (4+) AR. Eccentric
AR jet directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Image quality was
suboptimald - poor esophageal contact.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
A patent foramen ovale is present. The left ventricular cavity
is severely dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. Aortic leaflet
prolapse is present. The aortic regurgitation vena contracta is
>0.6cm. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric.
Post bypass
The patient is on a levophed drip at .1mcg/kg/min
A 29 Bioprosthetic valve has been placed.
The mean gradient across the valve is 9.
There is no AI/Paravalvular leaks
There is Inferoseptal dyskinesis with Inferior wall akinesis,the
rest of the LV function is preserved
RV function is preserved

Final Report
Standard Report Carotid US
Study: Carotid Series Complete
Reason: pre op Aortic Valve replacement
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries.
Minimal plaque is noticed.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 52/9, 54/9, 89/15
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 140 cm/sec. ECA peak
systolic velocity is 81 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is .64. These
findings are consistent with < 40 stenosis.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 69/13, 50/10, 71/9 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic velocity is 83 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is
177 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is .8
