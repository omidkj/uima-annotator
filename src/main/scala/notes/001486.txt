CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension with mental status changes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male with
a history of renal cell carcinoma, status post bilateral
nephrectomies, on hemodialysis with metastatic disease to the
lung, eye, penis, also with coronary artery disease, status
post myocardial infarction and a three vessel coronary artery
bypass graft, status post AICD pacer for V-fib arrest and
congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%, diabetes,
hypertension, history of upper gastrointestinal bleed who was
in his usual state of health until yesterday at hemodialysis
when his blood pressures were noted to the in the 60's but
resolved reportedly.  Last night when getting up from the
toilet after a bowel movement he fell without loss of
consciousness but hit his head on the sink and was dizzy.
The fire department evaluated him and decided he did not need
to come in.

He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16858**] the morning of admission, was somnolent
with blood pressures 50/palp with a weak pulse.  He got
intravenous fluids and his blood pressure increased to
62/palp.  His O2 saturations were 91% on room air, therefore,
he was placed on four liters.  Per his wife his mental status
changes since he hit his head last night but has been weak
for several days.  Was transferred to the Emergency Room with
blood pressures in the 60's, heart rate 93, began Vancomycin
1 gram times one and Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenous times
one, got two liters of normal saline and began a Dopamine
drip.  Then subsequently Levophed drip which increased his
MAPS to 65 but he was tachycardiac to 110 and only alert and
oriented times 1-1/2.  No elevated white blood count but a
left shift without bands.  Arterial blood gases was
7.48/41/141 with a lactate of 2.2 on 100% non-rebreather.  He
was transferred to the MICU for further care.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies chest pain, diarrhea, headache,
rashes, has felt short of breath (sometimes).

Chest x-ray:  Increased consolidation of the left lower lobe
atelectasis verses pneumonia, atelectasis of left upper lobe
is new, moderate left pleural effusion with extension to the
left apex, increase in evidence of congestive heart failure.

Head CT without contrast, no intracranial or acute process.
Stable since [**2166-1-6**].  Abdominal and pelvic CT without
contrast.  Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right associated with atelectasis of basis, nodular
densities in the lung, the right lower lobe.  Renal:  Mass.
Vertebral lesions - lytic osseous lesions.  No Triple A or
retroperitoneal bleed.  Liver, bowel, gallbladder, pancreas
within normal limits and an enlarged spleen.

ASSESSMENT:  74-year-old male with hypotension in the setting
of metastatic renal carcinoma.  Status post nephrectomy, is
on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%
and coronary artery disease.  Differential diagnosis includes
sepsis however, there is no clear source at this time.
Hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency and question of an
myocardial infarction but the electrocardiogram was without
changes and the first enzymes were flat.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU and
was hypotensive requiring pressors and placed on Dopamine and
Levophed which increased blood pressures.  Had a Head CT and
Abdominal CT without contrast showing no head bleed, a large
left greater than right pleural effusion, metastases to the
right lower lobe and an 8x5 cm large renal mass.  He was
initially maxed out on two pressors but then was titrated
only to one, Levophed with blood pressures in the 80's to
90's.  Minimally responsive to fluid and blood and placed on
stress dose of steroids.  The hypotension was of unclear
etiology at first.  So it was decided to perhaps to have a
bedside echo done to rule out tamponade as he did have upper
extremity edema with lower extremity edema and this echo
showed a right ventricular mass/tumor, 35% EF with wall
motion abnormalities.  It was unclear what this mass was in
the right ventricle an thought it was maybe a clot.  We were
hesitant to start anti-coagulation without thoroughly ruling
out brain metastases with a contrast study.  However, he had
an allergy to CT contrast and was unable to have an magnetic
resonance scan because of his pacer.  It was decided that we
would pre-medicate him for this supposed allergy to
intravenous contrast and go ahead with getting a head CT to
rule out a bleed or metastatic disease as well as we were
interested in looking at the test in order to rule out
inferior vena cava syndrome.  He did have his upper extremity
edema and when we tried to place a
