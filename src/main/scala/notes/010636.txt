Pertinent Results:
[**7-27**] Echo: The patient is post ascending aortic repair. The left
atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**2145-7-18**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. A mobile density is seen in the
ascending aorta, arch and descending thoracic aorta (45 cm from
the lips through TEE) consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is
a calcification seen on the non coronary cusp. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. POST-BYPASS: The ascending aortic and arch
graft looks intact. Residual flap seen in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve has no insufficiency. Mild MR>
LVEF 55%. Normal Rv systolic function.
.
[**2145-7-18**] Chest CT: 1. Type A aortic dissection extending from the
right brachiocephalic artery origin to the proximal common iliac
arteries. False lumen supplies all major branch vessels, except
the left renal artery. 2. Thrombosed right renal artery, with
complete nonopacification of the right
kidney. 3. Partially thrombosed mesenteric vessel ostia, with
good distal opacification. 4. Short-segment occlusion of the
right common iliac artery, with delayed collateral/retrograde
flow.
.
[**2145-7-19**] Renal U/S: 1. Limited Doppler examination of the kidneys
due to motion; however, arterial and venous flow identified
within each kidney. 2. Trace of ascites and perinephric free
fluid, no hydronephrosis. 3. Simple left renal cyst.
.
[**2145-7-31**] Chest X-Ray: Right central venous catheter is projected
over the superior vena cava. Mediastinal silhouette appears
widened but unchanged. I see no definite vascular congestion.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions and minimal
plate-like atelectasis in the right middle lobe. The asymmetric
pulmonary edema on the right continues to clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60-year-old patient with about 2-hour history of acute
chest pain that presented to the emergency room and was
discovered to have type A aortic dissection seen on the CT scan.
The dissection was extending from just above the sinotubular
junction all the way to the iliacs. The patient was
hemodynamically stable. He had very weak or absent pulses in the
right leg with some complaint of numbness. Of note, his right
kidney was not being perfused well off the false lumen.
Preoperatively, he was seen by the vascular surgeons and the
plan was to observe the ischemic right leg until the repair of
the dissection is completed and reassessed. He was taken
emergently to the operating room and underwent:Emergency repair
of type A aortic dissection with ascending aorta and total arch
replacement using a size 24-mm Medusa Gelweave graft/ Aortic
valve repair with decalcification of the noncoronary cusp/ A
resuspension of the aortic valve/ Right axillary artery
cannulation. Please see operative report for further surgical
details. Cross Clamp time=50 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass
time=71 minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated on propofol,
epinephrine and Levo. He wa
