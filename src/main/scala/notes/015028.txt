History of Present Illness:
82 M cantonese speaking, with h/o HTN, HLD, CKD, RA on chronic
prednisone, stroke, who was initialy admitted to hospital for
right ankle fracture s/p fusion 5 days ago. Intra-op and
post-op, pt received 10 L with net positive 6-7 L of fluid. On
POD#2 pt had episode of HTN (bp 200/100s), tachycardic HR
120-150s, tachypnea in 30s, while eating dinner on the phone.
ABG 7.43/38/60/26. CXR showed pulm edema. He was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for pulm edema in setting of gross volume overload and
HTN/tachycardia. He was given hydralazine 10mg IV x1, EKG showed
V3-V5 ST depressions thought to be demand ischemia. Echo showed
mild lateral hypokinesis on echo, trop-0.30. While in the [**Name (NI) 153**],
pt was diuresed. Given lasix 20mg IV x 3, out 1.6 L, goal net
neg 1-2 L), he was also briefly given nitro drip but weaned off.
After diuresis he was transfered to the floor.
Pt had plans for rehab today but this morning (POD #4) he had
episode of pre-syncope and chest pain. Pt initialy felt fine,
ate breakfast, took all meds. He was briefly sleepy but
responsive. Family briefly left room and returned and noticed pt
was non-responsive (drooling, shook him, wouldnt wake up)-> a
CODE called, however he had pulse and was breathing, he then
vomited. During this time, he reported CP. Today, pt returned to
[**Location 153**] where he continued to have [**3-25**] chest pressure, EKG new TWI
(biphasic) in V2, V3, TWI in V4, V5, ST depressions V4, V5, V6
(2mm)- new compared to prior EKG, trop stable at 0.3, flat MB
and CK. He was given morphine, SL-nitrate (2 SL nitro resolved
CP), asa 325, plavix 300 x 1, atorva 80, heparin drip. SL- nitro
resulted in hypotension BP 120->80s->90s. He was given 1L bolus,
his UO has been minimal x3 hrs. He was transfered to cardiology
service for concern of NSTEMI and underwent cath.
.
[**Hospital1 18**] Cath Lab: L femoral approach. U/S guided stick but
developed hematoma early on in case. Given bivalirudin only
during case. Moderate RCA, L main with 50+% and Prox LAD 80%
stenosis sp 2 long overlapping Promus 28mm DES. Initialy thought
bypass, then decided unlikely CABG candidate. ASA, plavix 75. No
heparin. Received 240ml contrast, mild hyration overnight at
75/hr. Pulled sheath, compressed x 40 min but still tiny ooze.
Fem-stop applied, leave for 2 hrs. If getting bigger, would
re-apply fem-stp. If worse in AM, can think of us. On mild nitro
drop for HTN.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is comfortable, family at
bedside. Denies any chest pain, no SOB. Does report right groin
fem-stop device is uncomfortable. Pt requests to eat food.
.

STUDIES:
Ankle Xray ([**2108-11-23**]):
FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: Status post tibiotalar and subtalar
arthrodesis.
The hardware appears intact. Please see operative report for
further details. In addition, there is distal fibular resection.

Ankle ([**2108-11-23**]):
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT ANKLE: Three screws transfix the
tibiotalar joints in appropriate alignment. A screw is also
noted going through the posterior subtalar joint. Two screws
transfix the distal tibiofibular joint. Bone graft material was
removed from the distal fibula. This detail is obscured due to
overlying cast. No evidence of hardware complications or lucency
is noted.
IMPRESSION: No hardware complication.

Foot Xray ([**2108-11-23**]):
Three views of the right ankle compared to the prior study from
[**2108-11-23**] of the same day demonstrate right ankle through a
splint. There has been triple arthrodesis with cannulated lag
screws trav
