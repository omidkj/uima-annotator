Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5062**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardial [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19843**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 38472**] is a 57-year-old woman with renal cell carcinoma
metastatic to her lungs with a recent progression of
disease in the area of her right mainstem bronchus status post
mechanical debridement of the endobronchial exophytic lesion by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 15054**] ER with
shortness of breath.  She has a history of recurrent pleural
effusions and has baseline DOE.  However, this week, she felt
dyspnea at rest, whereas she can normally walk 10 feet before
becoming short of breath.  She has a mild cough but no
significant sputum production.  She also has some chest pressure
with dyspnea that may be associated with nausea, diaphoresis but
does not radiate.  At [**Hospital1 498**], CXR showed right-sided volume loss,
likely secondary to post-obstructive atelectasis from tumor, and
bedside echo showed a "moderate pericardial effusion" without
evidence of tamponade.  She was transferred here for Further
management.

Also of note, she had a foley placed on [**8-9**] and has had
recurrent UTIs, for which she has been on 3 courses of Bactrim
(to which she developed an allergy), and son [**9-11**] she was
started on Cipro.  She states that since starting Cipro, she has
felt cramping and increased frequency.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 57098**] appetite has been poor. She
reports significant weight loss over the past six months.  She
gets intermittent migraines accompanied by visual changes (white
and dark spots).  She denies fever, chills, hearing changes,
palpitations, dysuria, rashes, focal weakness, numbness,
dizziness or fainting, easy bruising or bleeding.  Review of
systems is otherwise negative.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**9-/2151**] CT scan showed  Large left renal mass. MRI/MRV
demonstrated a large 7.5 cm left lower pole mass, with no
filling
defect of the left renal vein. Bone scan negative for osseous
metastases.
- [**2151-10-13**]: Left nephrectomy/adrenalectomy. Pathology: 5.5 cm
mass, extending locally beyond the capsule, [**Last Name (un) 19076**] grade II to
III, not extending beyond Gerota's fascia. Venous invasion was
present; the renal vein margin was negative. There were negative
margins and negative adrenal glands. (pT3a Nx Mx)
- [**2154-2-8**]:  A CT scan demonstrated multiple bilateral pulmonary
nodules, the largest 7 mm in diameter.
- [**2154-3-4**] PET scan: Multiple pulmonary nodules and posterior
cervical lymphadenopathy.
- [**2154-4-5**]: Video-assisted thoracoscopic right lower lobe and
right middle lobe wedge resections and mediastinal lymph node
dissection. Pathology confirmed the presence of metastatic
carcinoma of renal origin in the two wedge resections and in the
level 8R paraesophageal lymph node.
- [**2154-8-26**]:  Cycle 1, Weeks [**12-18**] of high-dose IL-2 ([**11-29**] and
[**4-29**] doses received).
- [**2154-10-14**] CT scan: Increase in the size of a right
infra-hilar
lymph node. Decrease in size of numerous small pulmonary
nodules.
- [**2154-11-11**] CT scan:  Right hilar lymph node slightly increased
in
size. Stable tiny pulmonary nodules as well as nodular scarring
in the right lower lobe.
- [**2154-12-18**] CT torso showed slight increase in dominant right
infrahilar mass when measured in the axial plane compared to the
prior two exams.
- [**2155-1-2**]: Flexible bronchoscopy revealed extrinsic
compression, with near complete occlusion of the
anterior segment of the right lower lobe bronchus and mucoid
secretions emanating from the superior segment of the right
lower
lobe.  Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed x3 with
pathology revealing atypical clusters of epithelioid cells
suspicious for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  In addition,
bronchial washings and brushings were obtained, revealing
atypical cells in scattered clusters.
- [**2155-1-29**]:  Flexible bronchoscopy and video-assisted thoracic
surgery with right lower lobe wedge resection and intralobar
pulmonary artery lymph node excision.  Pathology revealed lymph
node fragments with metastatic carcinoma consistent with renal
cell carcinoma.  The excised fragment of the right lower lobe
demonstrated no evidence of malignancy.
- [**3-/2155**]: Cycle 2, Weeks [**12-18**] high-dose IL-2 ([**8-30**] and [**4-29**] doses
received)
- [**2155-9-8**] - [**2156-5-24**]: Multiple CT Torso showing gradual
growth of right hilar lymphadenopathy.
- [**2156-7-19**]: Began therapy with MDX 1411 on Phase I protocol 08-209
- [**2156-10-18**]: Began palliative sunitinib after scans showed disease
progression with MDX 1411; needed to terminate first cycle one
week early due to severe thrombocytopenia (platelets 27k). Began
cycle 2 on [**2156-11-29**] at reduced dose of 37.5 mg daily. Began
cycle
3 on [**2157-1-10**] at 25 mg daily.
- [**2157-3-19**]: Switched to pazopanib because of progressive
difficulties tolerating sunitinib (and progressing disease on
lower doses of sunitinib); dose reduced to 600 mg daily due to
side effect. On [**6-8**] pazopanib dose was increased to 800 mg
daily
considering worsening clinical symptoms.
- [**2157-7-25**] CT TORSO shows overall improvement of pulmonary
nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy
- [**2157-9-8**] CT TORSO shows disease progression
- [**2157-9-12**] bronchoscopy showed tumor infiltration of the
endobronchial mucosa throughout the right main stem and bronchus
intermedius.  Endobronchial exophytic lesion partially
obstructing the opening of the right main stem, which was
mechanically debrided.
- [**0-0-**] external beam radiation to the lesion in
the R hilum.  [**0-0-**] additional palliative XRT
- [**2158-9-16**] everolimus
- [**2157-12-7**] - [**2158-3-27**] Avastin, d/c due to worsening symptoms
- [**2158-3-30**] CT torso shows disease progression
- [**4-18**] start Gemcitabine 750 mg/m2 D1 and D8 q21d, [**4-20**] start
Sutent 25 mg 2 weeks ON 1 week OFF
- [**7-3**] - Progression of pulmonary disease on gemcitabine/sutent,
but patient experiencing symptomatic improvement.
- [**7-10**] - C4D1 gemzar/sutent
- [**2158-7-24**] - C4D15 gemzar/sutent
- [**2158-8-9**] - Rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement
- [**2158-8-14**] - C5D15 gemzar/sutent
- [**2158-8-28**] - C6D1
