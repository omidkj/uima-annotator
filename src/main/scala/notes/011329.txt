Date of Birth:  [**2073-12-12**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34-year-old
gentleman who was struck in the head with a baseball bat .  The
patient was found
combative at the scene.  He was intubated, sedated, and
transported to [**Hospital6 302**] where a head CT revealed a
large subarachnoid hemorrhage with no shift or mass effect,
and a possible small right parietal subdural hematoma.  The
patient was given 25 gm of mannitol and transported to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.

On arrival, the patient's pupils were pinpoint.  He had right
upward gaze.  He was intubated and sedated.  His blood
pressure was 175/75, pulse 44, sat's 100 percent.  Repeat
head CT showed largely unchanged, positive right parietal
skull fracture, right-sided longitudinal temporal bone
fracture, air in the soft tissue, a large subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown at the time of admission.
Later from his wife, found that the patient was recently
given meds for hypertension.  No other past medical history.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  The patient was afebrile.  Blood pressure
175/75, pulse 44.  The patient also had a large laceration of
the right occipital area.  He was in a cervical collar.

LABS:  White count 19.9, crit 43.3, platelet count 153.  Gas
was 7.40, 33, 387 and 21.  He had a lactate level of 4 on
admission.  The patient's GCS was 5 at the scene.  The
patient had a ventricular drain placed on admission.  ICP was
21 after a drain was placed.

OTHER IMAGING ON ADMISSION:  CT of the maxillary sinuses was
negative.  CT of the C-spine and abdomen were also negative.
His chest x-ray was clear.  His KUB was also negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  ICP's were a problem for the first week of
patient's admission to the ICU, up as high as 42.  The
patient was given 75 gm of mannitol q 4 h.  On exam, he
opened his eyes and moved all 4 extremities.  The patient had
a repeat head CT done on [**9-9**] which showed vent drain in
place, a small right temporal extraaxial hematoma which was
unchanged from previous, a small punctate hemorrhagic
contusion in the temporal lobe, also a tiny contusion of the
basal right frontal lobe and left hemispheric cortex.  On
[**9-10**], the patient had a STAT head CT for increased ICP.  CT
showed right frontoparietal and left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter .  The
patient had sudden desaturation.
Chest x-ray showed lingular atelectasis.

The patient continued to have persistent high ICP's.  The
patient was put in a pentobarbital coma.  Chest x-ray showed
bilateral pleural effusions.  Despite being in the
pentobarbital coma, the patient's ICP's elevated to 30-40.
The patient reached his maximum for mannitol, given high
sodium and Osm.  The patient was given Lasix which brought
ICP's down into the 20's.

The patient had lower extremity Doppler's on [**9-12**] that
showed no evidence of DVT.  Head CT on [**9-12**] showed increase
in the ethmoid sinus opacity, possibly contusion of the right
frontal lobe via the right MCA, and continued effacement of
the sulci and ventricles from edema.

On [**9-13**], despite being in a pentobarbital coma with burst
suppression and functioning vent drain, the patient's ICP's
became uncontrollable into the 70's to 80's.  The patient was
taken emergently for a right anterior temporal lobectomy for
removal of the contused brain and a decompressive
craniectomy.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
There were no complications.  [**Month/Year (2) **], his pupils were 8 mm
and nonreactive. His incision was clean, dry and intact.  His
vital signs were stable.

On [**9-14**], the patient had an acute onset of desaturation.  He
had a CTA of his chest which confirmed a left upper lobe PE.
He had an IVC filter placed on [**9-14**].  General surgery was
consulted for question of ischemic bowel secondary to high
lactate levels.  CT of the abdomen  on [**9-14**] suggested
partially or early small bowel obstruction with decreased
caliber of celiac axis, increased bibasilar consolidation in
the lungs.  Head CT showed [**Month/Year (2) **] changes, otherwise stable.
The patient continued to be in pentobarbital coma [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
as no discernable exam, and despite that continued to have
small
spikes in his ICP requiring treatment with mannitol and
Lasix.  Vital signs were otherwise stable, and his lactic
acid levels were trending down by [**2108-9-16**].

On [**9-19**], the patient spiked to 103.8.  On [**9-19**], the patient
had a head CT that showed bilateral frontotemporal
encephalomalacia, right greater than left, but midline was
improved.  The patient had cerebral blood flow study scan
after being weaned off pentobarbital.  It did show blood
flow, but his exam was consistently poor.  Pupils were small
in diameter and nonreactive.  He had no movement in his
extremities.  His ICP was 6.  Chest x-ray on [**9-19**] showed
development of left lower lobe collapse and consolidation and
left pleural effusion.  KUB on the 18 showed the tip of his
OG tube postpyloric.  However, the patient was not tolerating
tube feedings secondary to high residuals.  Tube feeding was
discontinued, and the patient was started on TPN, the thought
being that still with lactic acid level high, he was not
absorbing his tube feedings, and it would give him bowel rest
and put him on TPN.  Due to his consolidation and pneumonia,
the patient's ventilatory support needed to be increased, and
the patient was not a candidate for trach at this point.

The patient had repeat head CT on [**9-20**] which was stable and
stable chest CT.  There was an improvement in the bilateral
consolidation.  His abdominal CT showed left lower quadrant
thickening, thick bowel versus collapsed lumen.  He spiked to
103.8.  The patient showing evidence of pancreatitis from his
TPN.  He was started on Flagyl for loose stool.  To date, CSF
cultures have been negative.  Blood cultures were negative.
Sputum grew Citrobacter, and the patient was started on
Levaquin.

Neuro exam slightly improved on [**9-24**].  The patient was
moving his right arm spontaneously, and tracking with his
eyes when off sedation.  His PEEP was being weaned.  His
pancreatitis was slowly resolving.  Drain was increased to 20
cm and clamped.  The patient tolerated clamping of the vent
drain.  Head CT after clamping the drain showed slight
enlargement of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].  On [**9-24**],
the patient was trach'd.  The patient was bronched, which
showed thick but clear secretions.  Sputum grew out
Acinetobacter and was given a dose of meropenem.  He was also
on Levaquin, Flagyl and cefazolin for the vent drain
prophylaxis.  The patient's vein drain was removed on
[**2108-9-26**].  He continued to have low-grade fevers.  On
[**9-25**], a chest x-ray continued to show bibasilar infiltrates
and increased on the right.  His head CT from [**9-22**] was
stable with no changes.  On [**9-26**], the patient had a stable
head CT with no change in the ventricular size.  The patient
was off propofol with minimal neuro exam, opening his eyes,
some spontaneous movement on the right side.

His condition remained stable, and he was transferred to the
Step Down Unit on [**2108-10-3**].  He has been seen by physical
therapy and occupational therapy.  He did grow out Staph coag
positive MRSA from his blood on [**9-29**] and was started on
vancomycin 1 gm IV q 12 h.  Latest sputum from [**9-29**]
continued to show Acinetobacter in his sputum.  On [**10-2**], he
had a tonic-clonic seizure and was reloaded on Dilantin.  On
[**10-1**], he also had flexion-extension films of his C-spine
under fluoro which cleared his C-spine.  The collar was
removed.  He had a repeat echo on [**10-2**] that was essentially
unchanged from previous, with an EF of 55-60 percent.  There
was no PFO and no evidence of clot in either chamber of the
heart causing emboli.

The patient was seen by physical therapy and occupational
therapy and found to require acute rehab.  His vital signs
have remained stable.  He is on IV antibiotics which finish
