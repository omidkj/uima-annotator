Chief Complaint:
fever, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Already intubated on transfer from OSH
A line
Esophageal balloon

History of Present Illness:
47-year old patient of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with a 15-year history of
Hodgkin's Disease, previously treated with chemotherapy
complicated by bleomycin lung and two allogenic bone marrow
transplants (2 and 6 years ago) complicated by heart failure and
radiation fibrosis who presents as a transfer from an outside
hospital after being intubated in the setting of a bleed during
a bronchoscopy with subsequent development of ARDS.
Patient was in usual state of health until this past [**Month (only) **]
when she presented to clinic with a fever and cough. A sputum
culture from [**12-25**] was noted to have sparce growth of
aspirgillus fumigatus and terreus. Galactomannan and beta glucan
negative. BAL deferred at patient's request. Treated with
Azithromycin and Cefpodoxime.
She did well and returned to work. She was given a DLI on [**1-14**].
On [**1-25**], she presented to [**Hospital **] Medical Center with worsening
fevers and shakiness for 48 hours. Chest imaging showed what was
felt to be worsening of her infiltrate (although it is unclear
what this was compared to) and pneumonitis. They performed a
bronchoscopy on [**2117-1-26**] which was complicated by an extensive
bleed leading to intubation. She later developed ARDS and was
started on IV steroids and pressors. She was started on an
antibiotic regimen which eventually included Linezolid,
Meropenem, Voriconazole and Acyclovir (prophylaxis dose).
She developed worsening hypercarbia on [**2-9**] and underwent a
workup for embolic disease. A CTA was negative for PE but showed
b/l pleural effusions R>L and a new left upper lung nodule of
1.4cm. In addition, diffuse ground glass opacities are present.
A right gastrognemius thrombus and a left cephalic thrombus was
found. An MRI of the brain showed a new left parietal lobe
infarcation. A CT also showed old infarction. Given abscence of
positive cultures per records at the time, antibacterials were
stopped on [**2-8**] and [**2-9**]. Voriconazole was continued. Atovaquone,
Acyclovir ppx was continued. The patient was started on high
dose Methylprednisolone 60mg Q8h on [**2-9**]. A pigtail catheter
drainage of R chest loculated effusion was planned for [**2-11**] but
was not done.
From the VS it appears that the patient was hypotensive on
[**11-19**]. No record of a fever. WBC up to 20,000.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
management given her extensive past medical care at [**Hospital1 18**]. She
arrived in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] intubated, sedated and in no apparent
distress. VS on arrival as below.

Past Medical History:
1. Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosing, diagnosed in [**2101**];
radiation to the mediastinum in [**2102**] and to the lymph nodes in
[**2115**]
2. Autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2103**]
3. Non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2110**],
MUD on [**2115-9-20**] ATG conditioning c/b serum sickness; Cellcept
discontinued in [**2115-5-8**], only on low dose Prednisone recently
(increased transiently to 20mg for pruritus)
4. Cardiomyopathy, chemotherapy induced.
5. Depression/anxiety
6. Urinary incontinence
7. GVHD related to transplant with dry eyes and occasional oral
involvement
8. Herpes Zoster, [**2-13**]
9. PCP infection in [**8-/2114**] and remains on Bactrim
10. CMV viremia [**9-14**]
11. EBV viremia [**2115-11-7**] MMF discontinued
12. BK viremia and viruria- [**2115-11-7**]
13. RSV infection in [**2116-2-7**]

46 yo female with a long history of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's
disease, s/p autologous SCT [**2101**], s/p sibling donor allogenic
transplant [**2110**], and s/p unrelated allogenic SCT with D 0 on
[**2115-9-20**]. Her post transplant course was notable for "serum
sickness" thought related to ATG with fevers, rash, and joint
pains. She was started on prednisone for control of the symptoms
and the steroids have subsequently been discontinued. She had a
relatively uncomplicated post-transplant course until she
developed CMV viremia with CMV viral load on [**2115-9-30**] noted at
4000. [**Doctor First Name 16883**] was started on IV ganciclovir. On [**2115-10-8**], she was
switched to valganciclovir for continued treatment. Subsequent
CMV viral loads on [**2115-10-6**] revealed a level of 9000, and
repeat on [**2115-10-11**] was 14,500. At this point, [**Doctor First Name 16883**] was switched
back to IV ganciclovir, and she was discharged to the local
apartments on [**2115-10-16**]. Unfortunately, her CMV viral load
increased further and she was readmitted for IV Foscarnet on
[**2115-10-24**]. With improvement in her CMV viral load, she was
discharged to the apartments on [**2115-11-9**] on IV ganciclovir. She
was switched to Valganciclovir 900 mg twice per day in mid
[**Month (only) 359**]. Her dose was decreased to 900 mg once per day as of
[**2115-12-5**]. She developed a macular papular rash and was seen by
Dermatology on [**2115-11-13**]. Biopsy was consistent with a drug
hypersensitivity reaction, possibly related to Foscarnet or
Bactrim. She also was treated for a short period of time with
Keflex for possible infected SK on her hand. Her Bactrim was
switched to Atovaquone and her Keflex was discontinued. She has
recently been noted for slowly decreasing counts thought related
to her Valcyte. However, [**Doctor First Name 16883**] was noted for increasing EBV
level of 400 and with concern for PTLD, she was admitted on
[**2115-12-15**] for evaluation and followup. Subsequent EBV viral
loads were < 8 and CT of the neck showed decreasing adenopathy.
CT of the torso showed stable adenopathy within the abdomen.
Bone marrow biopsy was negative for lymphoma. [**Doctor First Name 16883**] was
discharged on [**2115-12-19**]. Her counts have been recovering.
