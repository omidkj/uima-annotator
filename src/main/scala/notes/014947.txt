Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Cervical Myelopathy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Anterior Cervical Spine Surgery
Evacuation of Retropharyngeal Hematoma
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
76-year-old female with hx of breast cancer s/p mastectomy,
chemotherapy, radiation, paroxysmal a-fib, HTN, and chronic
propionibacterium acnes infection of her humerus, who presented
with cervical myelopathy, with signifcant gait abnormality and
was taken for anterior cervical decompression and fusion on
[**2139-7-14**].  MICU transfer requested for acute onset hypotension,
low urine output, tachypnea, and leukocytosis concerning for
sepsis.  She underwent 3 level fusion on [**2139-7-14**].
Post-operatively she developed hoarse voice and trouble
swallowing and she was transferred to TSICU because of
pre-vertebral neck swelling on neck xray. She went to the OR on
[**2139-7-15**] for decompression of hematoma which was evacuated. She
remained intubated for airway protection post op.

Her post op course has been complicated by dysphagia,
odynophagia. She has not passed speech and swallow, and is a
very high risk for aspiration. While in the TSICU intubated, she
was noted to have a lot of secretions. A bronch was done [**7-20**],
and cultures are growing Serratia and Staph aureus (no
sensitivities). She has been normotensive and on her home
anti-hypertensives. She was called out of the TSICU and
transferred to the floor on [**2139-7-22**]. Her antibiotics had been
amoxicillin which is suppressive therapy for her chronic
infection.

Today she was noted to be relatively hypotensive in the morning
with T 98.1, BP 90/50, HR 64, RR 36, and sat of 95% on 2L. She
was given 2L of D51/2NS, and pressures have improved to
100s-120s systolic, and her BP meds are being held. Her RR
continues to remain in the 30s.

Her I/Os today have been 2075/330 with 160 cc of urine over last
8 hours. She received 3L NS on the floor. WBC had been ranging
[**1-26**] throughout majority of hospital stay but increased to 29
this morning.  Her antibiotics were increased to Cefepime
yesterday.

On arrival to the MICU, pt states that she is exhausted and
fatigued. The patient was stabilized in the MICU and transfered
to the floor for further management.

Past Medical History:
Multiple surgeries for TB in the [**2067**], upper left lobectomy in
[**2096**]
C-sections in [**2103**] and [**2105**]
Transfer of palatal mucosa to her gingiva in [**2112**]
Hysterectomy in [**2113**]
Left sided mastectomy with lymph node dissection in [**2118**]
Prior TB infection in a sanitorium from [**10-23**] yo and partial
lobectomy
Stage III left breast cancer s/p mastectomy, chemotherapy,
radiation
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
Anemia.
Hypertension.
Bronchiectasis diagnosed in [**2096**].
Major lung hemorrhage in [**2096**] after left upper lobectomy.
Rickets
Pyelonephritis
Right humerus fracture s/p ORIF [**2139-3-23**] complicated by
Propionibacterium acnes growing in two tissue cultures s/p 6
weeks IV ceftriaxone therapy and then on oral amoxcillin
suppression

Social History:
Married for 36 years. Husband with [**Name2 (NI) **] in nursing home. 2
grown children and 2 step children. Lives in split home with her
daughter. Denies ever using tobacco, no illicits. Drinks
socially.


Family History:
Her mother died at age 86 with Parkinson's, also had a history
of hypertension.  Father died at age 33 with pneumonia. No
history of lung, colon or breast cancer

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
