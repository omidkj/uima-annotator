History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old Russian-speaking female wtih dual chamber pacer for
SSS/CHB, Afib on aspirin, distolic HF, h/o pericardial effusion
presents from NH after not feeling well over last week. Per her
daughters, she developed a cough and lower extremity swelling 10
days ago and her lasix was increased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and zaroxyln
was added. She improved slowely and over the past 3 days was
noted to be fatigued, nauseous, and stop eating and drinking. On
the am of presentation, she was found to have systolics in 80s
and presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with hypotension. At rehab over the past
few days, labs were notable for creatinine increasing from 1.8
to 3.6, and sodium dropping to 130.
.
In ED, vitals were T 99.4 HR 103 BP 78/50 RR 18 POx 94.
She reported only nausea. Unremarkable exam. Patient given
Ondansetron, Piperacillin-Tazo, Vancomycin 1g, and started on
Norepinephrine gtt. Blood cultures were sent. She received 2L NS
with improvement in SBP to 80s. Right IJ TLC placed in ED
without complication. CVP measured at 8 and an additional liter
of NS was given. EKG showed paced rhythm. Cardiology performed
bedside ECHO which domonstrated old left atrial myxoma and no
pericardial effusion. A foley [**Last Name (un) **] was placed with 300cc clear
urine output. Vital signs prior to transfer HR 84 BP 112/64 RR
24 POx 100% on 2L. Transferred on levophed 0.09.

[**3-26**] Echo
The left atrium is moderately dilated. A large (3.4 x 4.5 cm)
mass seen in the body of the left atrium. The right atrium is
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with Afib, SSS/ CHB s/p dual chamber pacer,
diastolic heart failure with recent exacerbation presents from
NH with poor po intake, nausea and fatigue x 3 days with
hypotension and acute on chronic renal failure.

#. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure - Patient had been admitted
with hypotension.  Patient had had shortness of breath one week
prior to admission and had been diuretic regimen increased.
Patient presented with SBP in 70s initially and did not repond
to fluid boluses.  Patient had mild elevation in cardiac
enzymes, thought to be related to myocardial stress.  Patient
required levophed on admission and 6L NS boluses to get MAP > 55
to wean pressors.  Patient Echocardiogram did not show any
evidence for tamponade or [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was preserved.  Patient's echo
showed newly elevated pulmonary pressures, which is new since
her prior echocardiogram.  It is unclear what the etiology of
her elevated PA pressures are, whether related to known [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 16564**] .  On discharge, patient's systolic BPs have been
100s-120.  Patient was restarted on [**12-7**] of her dose of lopressor
at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  On day of discharge, patient was restarted on
her lasix 40mg po and had small oxygen requirement at 2L NC.
Plan is for patient to be diuresed to being euvolemic and then
on maintanence dose of lasix.
.
Of note, on admission, patient was noted to be on Digoxin and
had level of 3.1.  Patient had no signs or symptoms of toxicity,
but given her propensity to become dehydrated and digoxin toxic,
this medication was discontinued and plan to be discontinued
indefinitely.  Plan was communicated with NP at [**Hospital1 100**].
- Continue Lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], uptitrate as tolerated
- Continue Lasix 40mg daily
- Restart Imdur once patient's SBPs are stable.
- Continue ASA 325mg daily
- Discontinue digoxin indefinitely
- Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**]

#. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure ?????? Pre-renal etiology.  On
admission, patient's Cr was 3.7 and responded to fluid
resusitation.  Patient's Cr trended down to 2.4 on day prior to
discharge.  Her baseline Cr is 1.8.  Patient's Creatinine was
not checked on day of discharge.  Will need to trend once
patient discharged to rehab.
- Check Chem 7 on [**2109-3-29**]
- renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
.
# ID:  Afebrile throughout admission.  Patient??????s CXR is not
concerning for PNA.  Patient had been treated at her facility
with levaquin but have decided to defer antibiotic as patient is
clinically doing well as she is afebrile, WBC trending downward.


#. Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid 112mcgs
.
#. Code - DNR/DNI

Medications on Admission:
levofloxac
