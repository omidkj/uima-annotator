PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed vital signs in the Emergency Department with a
temperature of 99.4, blood pressure was 150/53, heart rate
was 80, respiratory rate was 18, and oxygen saturation was
98% on room air.  Fasting fingerstick blood sugar was 90 at
this time.  In general, she was sleeping comfortably, obese.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The mucous
membranes were moist.  The neck was supple.  Heart was
regular in rate and rhythm.  The chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was obese, soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity examination revealed
there was no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed sodium was 141, potassium was 3.5,
chloride was 112, bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was
11, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 91.  White
blood cell count was 9.8 (with a normal differential),
hematocrit was 37.7, and platelets were 326.  Urinalysis was
negative.  Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.
Urine and serum toxicology screens were negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service for agitation, history of hypoglycemia, and not
taking her oral medications.

On the floor, she was maintained on a one-to-one sitter and
Psychiatry continued to follow.  She became agitated and had
numerous attempts to leave the floor; requiring both physical
and chemical restraint.  The patient received Haldol and
later that day was found to have an episode of total body
shaking and urinary incontinence.

A computed tomography of her head was performed which was
negative.  Neurology was consulted and felt that while Haldol
did decrease the seizure threshold, the patient had an
outside history of a seizure disorder and had not been taking
her anti-seizure medications for some period of time.

Once again, the patient had numerous attempts at attempting
to leave the hospital floor.  The decision was made to
transfer her to the Unit for closer monitoring while loading
her with intravenous Dilantin.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit on [**2179-4-25**] where she was maintained with a
one-to-one sitter.  The patient was loaded on Dilantin and
monitored for any seizure activity.  She also received Haldol
5 mg three times per day, and Ativan 1 mg q.4h. around the
clock, in addition to as needed Haldol and Ativan.

No seizure activity was noted.  Psychiatry continued to
follow, and her Seroquel was increased.
