History of Present Illness:
65 yo M was a pediatrian struck by a vehicle.  The pt was found
100 ft from his shoes.  The car was significantly damaged.  He
was hypotensive in the field, and he was noted to have RLE
angularization. He was found awake with a GCS12 but intubated
for protection, brought to [**Hospital1 18**] where trauma survey including
pan imaging reportedly significant for BLE open tib-fib
fractures with preserved distal pulses, forehead contusion,
isolated posterior max wall fracture, cervical fracture,
multiple rib fractures with pulm contusion, poss
aspiration, small unilateral PTX, and no obvious intra-abdominal
injury.

Studies at admission:

CT head ([**5-20**]): 1. Small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage,
without mass effect.
2. Depressed fracture through the posterior wall of the right
maxillary sinus with hemosinus.
3. Incompletely imaged fracture through the left lateral mass of
C2. Please refer to CT of the cervical spine for further
details.

CT abd/pelvis ([**5-20**]): 1. Multiple injuries involving the right
chest including fractures of ribs three through nine, fracture
of the right coracoid process, and contusions with traumatic
pneumatoceles in the right lung as well as a small medial right
pneumothorax. Some degree of aspiration may also be present as
there are secretions within the trachea.
2. Possible small right hepatic contusion, with a tiny amount of
perihepatic fluid. No additional intra-abdominal injury
identified.
3. Additional fractures involving the right inferior and
superior pubic rami.
4. Slit-like IVC, suggesting hypotension.
5. Incompletely characterized 3.1 cm right adrenal lesion. An
MRI can be
obtained on a non-emergent basis for further characterization.
6. Large right thyroid nodule - thyroid ultrasound is
recommended on a non-
emergent basis.
7. Incidentally: 3 cm infrarenal AAA, left renal cyst,
cholelithiasis,
sigmoid diverticulosis.

CT C-spine ([**5-20**]): 1. Left C2 lateral mass fracture extending
into the transverse foramen.
2. Left supraclavicular hematoma, not seen on the CT of the
torso.
3. Partially imaged right maxillary sinus opacification due to
posterior wall fractures seen on head CT.
4. Large right thyroid nodule measuring up to 4.6 cm, for which
thyroid
ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.

CTA lower extremity ([**5-20**]): 1. Patent vascularity in both lower
extremities without evidence of extravasation.
2. Comminuted fracture of tibia and fibula bilaterally,
extending into the
tibial plateau.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was brought to the ED intubated.  Orthopedics was consulted
for the open bilateral tib-fib fractures.  Orthopedics brought
the pt to the OR for bialteral lower extremity stabilization and
debridement of wounds.  Vascular Surgery was consulted
postoperatively for concern over possible vascular injury to B/L
LE.  Q1 hour vascular checks were initiated.  Neurosurgery was
consulted due to head trauma which included a small SAH, C2
fracture, and a R maxillary sinus posterior wall fracture.
Neurosurgery recommended continuing the C-collar and to withold
anticoagulation. A short chronological description of Mr.
[**Known lastname 99132**] stay follows:

[**5-20**]: To OR. Decreased doppler signal from RLE pulse but
resolved intraoperatively. Received 3 units packed red blood
cells, 2 FFP, 4L crystolloid, 800 estimated blood loss. Blood
from ETT. Hematocrit declined overnight - 2 units PRBC.
[**5-21**]: Patient with left pneumothorax - treated with chest tube,
and required temporary assist control for respiratory acidosis.
Hematocrit dropping, 2 U pRBC transfused.
[**5-22**]: To OR with ortho for ORIF Left tibial (plate) and Right
tibial nail, IVC filter placed, 2 U pRBCs transfused, repeat
washout R elbow. Left CT with no respiratory variation, but no
respiratory status changes.
[**5-23**]: Weaned to cpap/ps; lasix gtt / albumin started. Plan for
OR on [**5-24**] for skin graft/muscle flap LE. Fever 101 - cultured.
HCT 20.6, transfuse 2uPRBC.
[**5-24**]: OR postponed given long procedure which pt. would be
unable to tolerate. CTA of the neck to rule out vertebral artery
dissection. Lasix drip started.
[**5-25**]: s/p OR with ortho for elbow; no further operative ortho
needs. Got 1 unit pRBCs intra-operative. Continued lasix gtt.
Weaning vent. Increased free water GI flushes given rising Na
and Cl.
[**5-26**]: Lasix gtt d'ced; replaced arterial line.
[**5-27**]: Started Vanc/zosyn; Pt. arouses to voice, opens eyes
spontaneously, +gag/+strong productive cough. Pt communicates by
nodding/mouthing words, copious bloody secretions from pulmonary
contusion.
[**5-29**]: Trach/peg, started [**Hospital1 **] lasix, increase vanc to q8,
plastics considered taking to OR [**Hospital 99133**] rehab planning started,
temp spiked-->pan cx
[**5-30**]: Paient persistently febrile, Pancx sent, Bronched today-->
Mild thick secretion, BAL sent, Left Chest D/C, Ct scan shows no
evidence of sinusitis, but C2 vertebrae slightly rotated. Pt.
tested for H1N1 flu, currently placed on Droplet & Contact
Precautions until virus can be ruled out.
[**5-31**]: OR with Plastics for Left lower extremity closure, right
lower extremity VAC change. PRS to change vac q3-4 days, plan
for right lower extremity flap. Vascular consult for right lower
extremity formal angiogram for pre-op planning.
[**5-31**]: I.D. consult for ?Influenza given fever and exposure to RN
with Influenza A. Prelim recs: Doubt flu, but given critical
care pt would recommend tamiflu prophylaxis. Consider CT Torso
(deferred for now per trauma) to eval for fever sour
