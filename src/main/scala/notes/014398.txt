C1880 VENA CAVA FILTER  [**2165-10-13**] 5:59 AM

Reason: place IVC filter
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old woman with B PEs
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
place IVC filter
INDICATION: 65-year-old woman with bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Question of a subcapsular hepatic hematoma. Asked to place an
IVC filter.

RADIOLOGISTS: [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] (radiology resident) and [**Doctor First Name 4685**]
[**Doctor Last Name 4686**] (attending radiologist). Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4686**], the attending
radiologist was present and supervising throughout the
procedure.

TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: A written informed consent was obtained
prior to the procedure. The patient was brought into the
radiology suite and placed supine on the angiographic table. A
preprocedure timeout was performed. The right groin was prepped
and draped in standard sterile fashion. Under ultrasonographic
guidance, a suitable puncture site was determined. Uneventful
single wall venipuncture of the right common femoral vein was
performed. A 0.035 inch Bentson guidewire was advanced through
the needle into the inferior vena cava. The needle was removed
off the wire and a 5 French Omniflush catheter was steered into
the left external iliac vein. Hand injection demonstrated
appropriate positioning. Subsequently, a power injection
inferior vena cavogram was performed. Review of the images
demonstrated no caval anatomic variations, a single inferior
vena cava, without intraluminal filling defects. The level of
the renal veins was determined.

Based on the diagnostic findings, it was determined that an IVC
filter placement was indicated. The in situ catheter and sheath
were removed over the wire, and the IVC filter sheath was
advanced over the wire. A Gunther Tulip filter was then
delivered uneventfully to the lower margin of the L2 vertebral
body, inferior to the renal veins. It was successfully deployed
and the sheath was removed. Final abdominal radiograph
demonstrated good positioning and deployment of the IVC filter.
Hemostasis was achieved using digital compression for a total of
5 minutes. There was no residual bleeding or hematoma in the
right groin. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there
were no immediate postprocedure complications.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a Gunther Tulip IVC filter.
This filter can be removed within 14 days of placement if
medically indicated.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please evaluate liver with non-contrast scan
Field of view: 45

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old woman with B PE, ? liver hematoma
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate liver with non-contrast scan
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: recent IV study

INDICATION: History of bilateral pulmonary embolism with ? liver
hematoma.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is right lower lobe
atelectasis versus consolidation. There is a large low density
collection adjacent to the right lobe of the liver that appears
to conform to the liver capsule and produces mass effect upon
the right lobe. Hounsfield unit attenuation values range from 15
to 22. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. Pneumobilia
is noted. There is stranding adjacent to this large collection
extending along the right paracolic gutter.

The spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. The adrenal glands are
normal. There is a 10.6 cm exophytic cystic lesion at the upper
pole of the left kidney that appears to have a high density rim
and possible septation. Contrast material was present within the
kidneys from the patient's recent contrast-enhanced CT scan.
There is no intra-abdominal free air. Visualized loops of bowel
are grossly unremarkable.

Note is made of a spiculated area of soft tissue attenuation in
the left breast that appears to correspond to an area of a
surgical defect anteriorly.

Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. Large subcapsular collection producing mass effect upon the
right lobe of the liver with Hounsfield unit attenuation values
ranging from 15 to 22. Considerations include a chronic
subcapsular hematoma, or a subcapsular biloma in this patient
that is status post cholecystectomy.

2. Spiculated soft tissue density in the left breast that
appears to be near surgical defect. Correlation with the
patient's history and mammogram is recommended.

3. 11 mm exophytic lesion at the upper pole of the left kidney
with the suggestion of a high density rim and a possible
septation. Correlation with the patient's other outside imaging
is recommended. Further evaluation with an ultrasound or MRI
could also be performed to further characterize this lesion.

MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  [**2165-10-17**] 1:30 PM

MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST

Reason: please perform MRV of HEPATIC VEINS to evaulate for
clot/sou
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old woman 4 weeks s/p lap Chole with known PE &
subcapsular hematoma. upper and lower US neg for clot
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please perform MRV of HEPATIC VEINS to evaulate for clot/source
of PE
INDICATION: Four weeks status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy
with known pulmonary embolism, subcapsular hematoma. Perform MRV
of hepatic veins to evaluate for clot or source of pulmonary
embolism.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar MR imaging of the abdomen was performed,
including 2D time-of-flight images through the hepatic veins.

FINDINGS: There is an large subcapsular hematoma along the
lateral aspect of the liver, measuring approximately 17.3 cm AP
x 10 cm TV x 23.4 cm SI, resulting in significant leftward shift
of the hepatic parenchyma and compression upon the IVC. There is
patency and appropriate directional flow of the hepatic veins.

There is no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. There appears to be a small right-sided pleural
effusion. Visualization of the left adrenal gland and pancreas
appears unremarkable.

Low signal within the inferior vena cava after administration of
gadolinium at the infrarenal level likely represents an IVC
filter.

Evaluation of 3D acquired volumetric images of the abdomen is
degraded by motion.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large lateral subcapsular hematoma along the lateral aspect
of the liver.
2. No evidence of thrombus within the hepatic veins, which show
appropriate directional flow.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Surgical service and transferred to the
ICU for close monitoring. She was placed on a Heparin drip and
later changed to Lovenox; an IVC filter was placed. She did
remain on the Lovenox for several days after IVC filter
placement, but this was eventua
