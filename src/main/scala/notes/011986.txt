blood cx [**9-27**] - no growth (final)
.
CXR [**9-26**]:
1. New left lower lobe consolidation, suspicious for pneumonia.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Stable asymmetrical pleural and parenchymal scarring, more
prominent in the right apex than the left.
.
CXR [**9-27**]: Rapidly improving left basilar consolidation.
Although possibly due to improving pneumonia, the rapid
improvement favors at least a component of aspiration.
.
CT chest [**9-27**]:
1. Tiny right middle lobe pulmonary artery filling defect,
likely
representing chronic pulmonary embolus.
2. Enlarged left axillary lymph node.
3. Left 7th rib lytic lesion. In the setting of history of
breast cancer, bone scan is recommended for further evaluation.
4. Consolidation within the left lower lobe and additional
bilateral
centrilobular nodular opacities consistent with superimposed
infectious process.
4. Pneumobilia. Clinical correlation is recommended.
5. Left lobe thyroid nodule may be further evaluated with
ultrasound.
.
EKG [**9-27**]: A-V dissociation with ventricular paced rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-10-4**] atrial sensed
ventricular paced rhythm has been replaced by the A-V
dissociation with ventricular pacing.
.
ECHO [**9-28**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Thyroid U/S [**9-28**]: Scans through the right surgical bed of the
thyroid shows no evidence of residual thyroid tissue, masses or
lymphadenopathy. The left lobe of the thyroid is virtually
completely replaced by a large solid and cystic mass, which is
moderately vascular in the solid portions. This measures 4.5 x
3.6x
3.7 cm and extends into the superior mediastinum. CONCLUSION:
Status post right thyroidectomy. Large solid and cystic mass in
the left thyroid corresponding to the lesion on CT scan.
.
CXR [**10-2**]:
The shape of the chest and relative hyperlucency of the lungs
suggests COPD. Region of infrahilar opacity in the left lower
lung is more pronounced today after showing substantial clearing
between [**9-26**] and 20th. This could be pneumonia, but was
probably due previously to aspiration or atelectasis. Lungs are
otherwise clear of any focal abnormalities. The heart is normal
size. Tiny left pleural effusion or pleural scarring is
unchanged. Intended right atrial and ventricular pacer leads
follow their expected courses, continuous from the left pectoral
pacemaker.
.
CXR [**10-2**]: 1. Satisfactory position of subclavian introducer
sheath. However, the central portion is kinked and may need to
be repositioned for optimal flow. 2. Slightly worsening
interstitial edema.
.
ECHO [**10-2**]:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
2. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
4. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2131-9-28**],
there has been no significant change
.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. CARDIAC:
a. PERFUSION: Patient was chest pain free throughout her
admission. She became hypotensive for several days and her
cardiac enzymes remained negative x3 following that episode. No
evidence for ongoing ischemia. She was monitored on telemetry
for her bradycardia which resolved with the replacement of her
pacemaker. She was on a beta-blocker, furosemide and an ACE-I on
admission, but those were held once she became hypotensive. Her
BP remained in the high 90s-11
