HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 68 year old
white female with hypertension, end stage oxygen dependent
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to an
outside hospital with chest pain.  Her electrocardiogram
showed ST elevations, consistent with inferior myocardial
infarction and she was treated with         10 units times
two and heparin bolus with restoration of ST segments and
chest pain.  Post-treatment she was noted to have
bradycardia.  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] and seen for further care.  En route, she
became more somnolent and eventually unresponsive with fixed
and dilated right pupil.  She was intubated on arrival to
[**Hospital6 256**].  Computerized
tomography scan was done and showed subdural hematoma and the
patient was regressed with Protamine, fresh frozen plasma and
the bur hole was placed to relieve the symptoms of hematoma
by Neurosurgery.  The patient was Do-Not-Resuscitate and
Do-Not-Intubate on arrival.  The family arrived shortly after
and expressed the desire not to intervene except for comfort
measures.  The patient was transferred to the Medicine
Intensive Care Unit.  She was extubated and died after two
hours.  She was pronounced dead at 5:10 AM.  Her physical
examination was notable for absent heartsounds, breathsounds
and pulse.  There was no pupillary reflex or withdrawal from
pain.

The patient's family was at the bedside at the time of her
death.  Her primary care physician was notified.  The
patient's family has declined post mortem examination.
