Imaging:
CT A/P [**2112-7-9**]:
1. No apparent etiology to abdominal pain.
2. New right pulmonary consolidation and extensive ground-glass
opacity with a background of emphysema. These findings suggest
possible pneumonia and should be correlated to clinical
presentation and followed to resolution by imaging.
3. Unchanged thickening of the left adrenal gland. This could be
correlated to serum biochemical markers if clinically indicated.

4. Unchanged abdominal aortic aneurysm.

CXR [**2112-7-8**]:
1. Large area of ground-glass, airspace opacity projecting over
the
mid-to-lower right lung, consistent with consolidation, which
could be
secondary to infectious process, hemorrhage, or infarct.
Clinical correlation advised. 2. Possible trace right pleural
effusion.

LENI LLE [**2112-7-10**]: IMPRESSION: No DVT.

[**7-12**] CHEST PORT LINE PLACEMENT: Dense stable right lower lobe
consolidation and moderate cardiomegaly.  Clinical correlation
is suggested as to the cause of this dense consolidation, as
mentioned in a previous report, the differential diagnosis
includes infection, infarction or hemorrhage.
The peripherally inserted central catheter is projected over the
right atrium and should be retracted by approximately 5 cm.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Brief Hospital Course:
`73M with multiple medical problems including HIV (CD4 6, VL 48
on [**5-/2112**]) on HAART, atrial fibrillation (not on Coumadin),
distant history of peptic ulcer disease who  presented with
hematochezia, pneumonia, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia.

#Ischemic colitis: Bright red blood per rectum with suspicion
higher that lower GI source was thought to be due to ischemic
colitis (in setting of dehydration). He had no diverticula on
prior colonoscopy. AVM was also in the differential. Also
considered in HIV immune compromised patient was lymphoma, CMV,
or histoplasmosis but these seemed less likely. He was given 2
units of bloo
