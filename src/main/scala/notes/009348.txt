[**2169-1-26**] CT C Spine : 1. No fracture or malalignment.
2. Tiny radiopaque density in the region of the hypopharynx and
oropharynx . Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**2169-1-26**] Head CT : 1. Hyperdensity in the right perimesencephalic
cistern, concerning for small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Possible tiny focus of layering hemorrhage within the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the left lateral ventricle.

[**2169-1-26**] CT Torso :
1. Multifocal consolidation in the lungs, predominantly in the
upper lobes, which most likely reflect pulmonary contusions.
There are associated pneumatoceles, largest in the left upper
lobe.
  2. Multiple radiopaque densities within the skin of the upper
and mid back, likely reflect foreign bodies.

[**2169-1-27**]  MRI Head :
1. Multiple punctate blooming foci of susceptibility artifact,
some of which demonstrate corresponding restricted diffusion,in
the frontal lobes and splenium of the corpus callosum,
bilaterally. These findings are consistent with extensive
diffuse axonal injury, likely explaining the clinical
presentation.
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage predominately within the bilateral
occipital lobar and at the left vertex sulci, with a small
amount of hemorrhage layering in the left lateral ventricle, and
no evidence of hydrocephalus.
3. Small fluid levels within the paranasal sinuses. Given that
the initial head CT dated [**2169-1-26**] demonstrated clear
sinuses, these findings are most likely related to intubation
and supine positioning.

[**2169-1-27**] MRI C Spine : 1. No evidence of traumatic injury to the
cervical spine or spinal cord.
2. Fluid noted in the oropharynx, attributable to recent
intubation and
retained secretions.

[**2169-2-8**] CXR :
Comparison is made with prior study [**2-3**].

Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. There has been
markedly improved lung opacities, some opacities persist in the
left lower lobe in the retrocardiac area and superior to the
right hilum medial in the right upper lobe. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiac size is top normal.
There are low lung volumes. Pneumoperitoneum has decreased.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**] was evaluated in the Emergency Room by the Trauma
team and then admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management
and care. He had a small subdural hematoma by Head CT and on
exam had no eye opening, small non reactive pupils and a strong
cough.  He moved his right side to pain. All other extremities
responded with abnormal extension.  He had no spontaneous
movements.  He was maintained on full mechanical ventilation and
underwent frequent neuro checks.  He was placed on a 7 day
course of prophylactic Keppra.

An MRI of his head revealed diffuse axonal injury and an MRI of
his neck showed no ligamentous injury therefore his C collar was
removed on [**2169-1-27**]. He required increased doses of Propofol and
Fentanyl as he was extremely agitated when his sedation was
weaned and actually required reintubation twice as he self
extubated himself with his right hand. He eventually underwent
tracheostomy to protect his airway and PEG tube placement for
nutrition.

Daily temperature spikes prompted multiple cultures and
sinusitis was demonstrated on CT.  He was subsequently treated
with Flagyl and Cephapine for a 7 day course.
From a pulmonary standpoint he was eventually weaned off the
respirator and maintained on a trach collar with vigorous
pulmonary toilet.

He was evaluated by the ENT service as a foreign body was noted
in the hypopharynx on CT of the C spine. Direct laryngoscopy was
done at the bedside but no foreign body was noted nor were there
any signs of mucosal infection.  He will follow up with ENT as
an out patient.

[**Doctor First Name **] was transferred to the Trauma floor on [**2169-2-3**] for further
rehabilitation.
He remained restless and agitated and continued to have strong,
spontaneous movements of his right side but less so on the left.
 He does not respond to commands. His agitation and restlessness
was controlled with Haldol around the clock and on occasion he
would need an IV dose.  His pain was controlled with Methadone
20 mg [**Hospital1 **].  It should be weaned down to 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] as long as he
is able to tolerate his PT regime at rehab.

Multiple urine cultures were done as he had an elevated WBC to
19K without bandemia.  All of his cultures were negative and his
WBC  was 15K.  On [**2169-2-8**] he had a high temperature of 100.7
along with an elevated WBC of 18.9 without bands. For that
reason he had blood, urine and sputum cultures obtained.  His
urinalysis was negative and a chest xray showed no pneumonia.
He did have a PICC line in which was then removed and the tip
was cultured.  Currently all cultures are prelinarily negative
and he has not had any other fevers. He remains off antibiotics.

He was seen daily by the Physical Therapy service and
Occupational Therapy.  The Social Workers were very involved
with his family during his admission
to try to keep them updated on his condition and help them deal
with this devastating injury. After a prolonged hospital stay he
was discharged to rehab for vigorous treatment in the hopes of
his regaining some of his baseline function.
