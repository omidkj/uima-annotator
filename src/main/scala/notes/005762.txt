[**8-31**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage.

[**8-31**] CXR IMPRESSION: Subtle patchy opacities likely represent
PCP pneumonia in this
HIV+ patient. Other causes of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Prominence of
the hila likely represents pulmonary vascular congestion or
lymphadenopathy

[**8-31**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis-IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities,
basiliar consolidation and apical bullae. These findings likely
represent PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]. Other causes of infectious pneumonia
cannot be excluded.

[**9-4**] Brain MRI IMPRESSION: Diffuse dural and tentorial
enhancement without associated
leptomeningeal enhancement. Underlying meningitis cannot be
excluded and
follow-up is suggested. Cerebral atrophy compatible with
patient's known HIV
status.

[**9-4**] CXR Pa/lat: IMPRESSION: Near-complete resolution of
bilateral infiltrates. Tiny pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 39 yo M w/ HIV/AIDS, admitted w/ change in MS, F, currently
being treated for S pneumo meningitis/pna.

1)PNA/meningitis-   ID consulted on the case and felt that he
should be treated for both pneumonia and meningitis.  Blood,
CSF, and urine cultures remained negative (including for
legionella for virus).  Gram stain of sputum was positive for
GPC in pairs, and it was felt that patient likley had S.pneumo
(although cultures were negative).  MRI was c/w meningitis, but
it could not be discerned whether this was viral or bacterial.
Repeat LP before pt transferred to floor showed few white cells
and monocyte predominant.  It was unclear how to interpret this
result so it was felt that the patient should complete a course
of ceftriaxone at the meningeal dose.
-PICC placed for completion of 14d course of ceftriaxone 2g iv
qd
-pleural effusions should be followed radiographically.

2)HIV-pt was w/o evidence of opportunistic infection while on
floor.  He had apparently been speaking with his PMD regarding
starting HAART therapy.  His low cd4 count neccesitated that we
begin PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
  -Bactrim 1 DS
  -HAART as outpt.

3)Hilar LAD- finding on chest CT.  should be followed as outpt
in [**5-20**] weeks pending radiographic resolution of PNA
  -f/u as outpt w/repeat CT.(however note below)

***post hospital course c/b discovery of AFB positive sputum
culture, as per attg note PMD contact[**Name (NI) **] who was to contact pt.
[**Name2 (NI) 11219**] sent to state for identification and sensititivities.

4)low plts- 104 on admission, then dropped slightly but improved
over the course of admission. possibly initially low secondary
to sepsis/sirs vs hit ab. On d/c plt 133.
  -further w/u as outpt.
