BRIEF HISTORY:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female who had a known
history of aortic valve regurgitation, aortic stenosis, who
had two episodes of pulmonary edema and had been hospitalized
for that and progressive worsening of dyspnea.  The patient
had been a nursing home and rehabilitation, and had acute
onset of dyspnea in the morning.  Was transferred to the
hospital and found to be in congestive heart failure, but
continued on gentle diuresis.  Coumadin was stopped for
atrial fibrillation, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2742**].

Her past medical history is significant for aortic stenosis
and congestive heart failure with multiple hospital
admissions, anemia considered iron deficiency, urinary tract
infection and was on Levaquin, status post inguinal hernia
repair, status post hemorrhoidectomy, history of
diverticulitis, laser surgery on the eyes and deep venous
thrombosis, which the patient was on Coumadin for.

Allergies to penicillin.

Her medications on admission was Zestril 5 mg po q day,
Lopressor 12.5 po bid, iron 325 mg q day, intermittent IV
Lasix, and Tequin 200 mg po q day.

Her laboratories on admission:  White count was 5.8,
hematocrit of 31, platelets of 191,000.  Her creatinine was
0.8.  K was 3.8.  BUN of 13.  INR of 1.2.

Physical examination shows an elderly female.  Her pupils
were reactive to light, but slow.  Her neck was supple.
There was positive jugular venous distention.  Her lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular, rate,
and rhythm with a 4/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Her abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended and bowel sounds were
present.  Extremities were warm and well perfused.

Patient was brought here to the hospital to [**Hospital3 **] and
was admitted to the Medical Service where a cardiac
catheterization was done to evaluate her aortic stenosis in
the aortic valve.  After postcatheterization, Cardiac Surgery
was consulted.  During cardiac catheterization, there was
found to be a mild-to-moderate calcified aortic valve with
right aortic valve area of 0.5 cm.  Patient decided upon
having surgery and was taken to the operating room on
[**2155-9-9**], where an aortic valve repair was done with a
pericardial valve as well as repair of an ASD.

The patient was transferred to the SICU postoperatively, and
she did well.  She was fully weaned off of her pressors and
also weaned off of her ventilator.  Her blood pressure was
high postoperatively, therefore requiring Nipride drip.  The
Nipride was fully weaned and captopril was restarted.
Patient was in afib and Lopressor was also started at that
time.

On postoperative day #2, Lasix was started and diuresed the
patient as well her chest tubes were removed.  Physical
therapy was consulted in order to help with her ability with
ambulation.  However, the patient was unable to ambulate due
to pain in her right calf.  It was felt at that time the
patient would benefit most from a rehab facility.

Patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #3.
On postoperative day #4, her wires were removed.  Her
Lopressor was increased and her Lasix was decreased.  Her INR
was followed, and she was restarted on Coumadin both for her
AF and for positive deep venous thrombosis in the past.
Lower extremity Dopplers were done which showed no deep
venous thrombosis at this current time.

The patient continued to improve, and aggressive pulmonary
toilet was done in order to help wean her from her oxygen.
The patient was doing well postoperatively, and was screened
for rehabilitation.  On postoperative day #6, patient
continued on her Coumadin for a goal INR of [**1-19**].  The patient
is discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

Her discharging medications include Coumadin 2 mg po q hs for
a goal INR of [**1-19**], [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq po bid, oxybutynin 5 mg po
tid, albuterol nebulizer q4 hours prn, Lopressor 50 mg po
bid, Lasix 40 mg po bid, ipratropium one nebulizer q6 hours,
captopril 6.25 po tid, Dulcolax 10 mg PR q day prn, milk of
magnesia 30 cc po q hs prn, Percocet 1-2 tablets po q4 hours
prn, EC-ASA 325 mg po q day, and Colace 100 mg po bid.

Patient is discharged to rehabilitation facility.  Instructed
to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in [**3-22**] weeks, her primary care
physician 1-2 weeks, and Cardiology in [**1-20**] weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Aortic stenosis and aortic regurge
status post aortic valve repair with pericardial valve,
anemia, urinary tract infection, inguinal hernia repair,
status post hemorrhoidectomy, history of diverticulitis,
status post laser eye surgery, and deep venous thrombosis in
the past.

The patient is discharged in stable condition.  Please see
