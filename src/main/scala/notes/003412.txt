[**2111-4-7**] CTA chest
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from thoracic inlet
to the upper abdomen after administration of 130 cc of Optiray
intravenously; no oral contrast was used. Sagittal and coronal
reformatted images were then obtained.
CTA of the chest: No filling defect is noted within the main
pulmonary artery and its branches to suggest pulmonary embolism.
The study is somewhat limited by patient breathing throughout
the scanning. The heart and great vessels appear normal. No
pathologically enlarged central lymph nodes are noted.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, increased bronchovascular
markings, septal thickening and fissural prominence are
consistent with fluid overload; Focal areas of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
appearance are noted diffusely bilaterally suggesting an
underlying lung infection. The tree- in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in some
areas have a confluent and consolidative pattern. No
pneumothorax is visualized. The visualized portion of the upper
abdomen including dome of the liver and spleen appear
unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion and diffuse septal
thickening are consistent with fluid overload. Areas of
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance with confluent consolidation are
concerning for a superimposed infection.
2. No pulmonary embolism is detected.

[**2111-4-8**] Renal ultrasound
No comparisons available.

The study is somewhat limited due to patient body habitus. The
right kidney measures 10.3 cm and the left kidney measures 11
cm. Both kidneys are normal in size and appearance with no
stone, mass, or hydronephrosis. Both kidneys demonstrate normal
echogenicity and normal thickness of the cortices.

IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.

[**4-8**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2111-4-12**].
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate to
severe [3+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Ascites.
Conclusions
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion
located just behind the inferolateral wall.. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-4-12**],
the findings are similar.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-4-11**] 3:07 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: cause of widened mediastinum

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
36 year old woman with widened mediastinum s/p plasmaphoresis
cath placement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
cause of widened mediastinum
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: renal failure

INDICATION: 36-year-old woman with widened mediastinum after
plasmapheresis catheter placement. Please evaluate the cause of
the widened mediastinum.

Comparison is made to the prior CTA of the chest performed on
[**2111-4-7**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images of the chest were obtained with no
IV contrast administration.

CT OF CHEST WITH NO IV CONTRAST: The soft tissue windows
demonstrate interval development of the right-sided mediastinal
hematoma adjacent to the SVC, which has developed since prior
study.

There has been interval placement of the right central line,
which enters the right subclavian vein and the right
brachiocephalic vein but appears to terminate in the posterior
wall of the SVC. This a
