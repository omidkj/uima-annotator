HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year old woman with
known multiple medical problems who was admitted to an
outside hospital after falling twice at home.  At the outside
hospital she ruled in for a myocardial infarction.  She
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
   infarction.
2. Hypertension.
3. History of abdominal aortic aneurysm 4 cm.
4. Peripheral vascular disease.
5. Status post right femoral popliteal bypass.
6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Patient is [**Age over 90 **]
   pack year smoker.
7. Obesity.
8. Anxiety.
9. Left atrophic kidney.
10.      Osteoarthritis.
11.      Degenerative joint disease.


ALLERGIES:  Patient states she is allergic to codeine which
causes nausea and vomiting.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Include Verapamil, Lipitor,
Lisinopril, aspirin, nitroglycerin, Protonix, Bactrim,
Ambien, Celebrex, cimetidine, Tylenol number 3 and Coumadin
which was for her peripheral vascular disease and her femoral
popliteal bypass.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives in an apartment by herself in
[**Hospital3 4634**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission to the [**Hospital1 190**] the patient was seen and evaluated by
neurology.  At the outside hospital the patient had a CT scan
which showed chronic lacunar ischemic changes in the basilar
region with no acute hemorrhage.  It was felt that her
presentation was consistent with a peripheral vestibular
process and it was recommended that patient underwent MRI to
rule out any intracranial event that was not able to be seen
on CT scan and also obtaining a carotid ultrasound.  Also
patient had been noted to have elevated creatinine on arrival
to the outside hospital.  By the time she arrived at [**Hospital1 1444**] it was down to the 1.5 range.
It had risen to a high of 2.9 at the outside hospital.  The
patient underwent an MRI/MRA and a carotid ultrasound.  The
carotid ultrasound showed a right internal carotid artery
stenosis of 80 to 99 percent and left internal carotid artery
stenosis of 40 to 59 percent.  The MRI/MRA revealed
microvascular disease.  No evidence of discrete infarct.  Old
cerebellar lesion.  Patient was cleared for bypass surgery
and it was felt that it was no indication for carotid
vascularization.  Patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory on [**10-24**].  Cardiac
catheterization showed a 90 percent distal left main
stenosis, 80 percent proximal left anterior descending
coronary artery lesion, 80 percent origin of the left
circumflex lesion and 50 to 60 percent first obtuse marginal
lesion with a proximally occluded right coronary artery
lesion.  The patient underwent echocardiogram which showed an
ejection fraction of 60 percent, mildly dilated left atrium,
left ventricular hypertrophy, normal right ventricular
chamber size and wall motion, mildly dilated aortic arch,
mildly thickened aortic valve leaflet and some mild diastolic
dysfunction.

As patient had been cleared for surgery the patient was taken
to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**10-27**] and
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times two, left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to first obtuse
marginal.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Total
cardiopulmonary bypass time 56 minutes.  Crossclamp time 36
minutes.  She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.  Patient remained intubated until
postoperative day number one due to mild hypoxia.  She was
weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on
postoperative day number one.

Patient continued to have mild hypoxia, was given diuresis
and aggressive pulmonary toilet with gradual improvement in
her oxygen status.  On postoperative day number three patient
developed atrial fibrillation.  She was started on
amiodarone.  She was seen and evaluated by Physical Therapy
where it was determined she would benefit from a stay at
short term rehabilitation.  On postoperative day number four
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to the
regular part of the hospital.  When she arrived in the
regular part of the hospital she developed atrial
fibrillation.  Patient was given Lopressor to slow her heart
rate.  Patient was started on Coumadin for anticoagulation.
On postoperative day number six patient was found to have a
moderate amount of diarrhea.  This was sent for C difficile
but concerning the patient had mildly elevated white blood
cell count postoperatively and continued to do so patient was
empirically started on Flagyl for presumed C difficile.
Patient was cleared for discharge to rehabilitation on
postoperative day number six.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature 98.6, pulse 84 in sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 146/70, respiratory rate 20, oxygen
saturation 94 percent on 4 liters nasal cannula.  Laboratory

PTT 31.7.  Neurologically the patient is awake, alert,
oriented times three, nonfocal.  The patient is legally
blind.  Lungs are clear bilaterally with no rales or wheezes.
Cardiac regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Incision is clean, dry and intact.  There is no drainage or
erythema.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Patient
is tolerating regular diet.  Patient vein harvest site is
clean and dry.  She has a moderate amount of ecchymosis in
her left thigh.  She has some serosanguineous drainage at her
left knee at a previous drain site.  There is no erythema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:

6. Coumadin 1 mg P.O. on [**11-2**].  Patient is to have a PT/INR
   checked daily and titrate Coumadin for a goal INR of 1.5
   to 1.8.
7. Regular insulin sliding scale as directed.
