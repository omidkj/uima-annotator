Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers, Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
59 yom with PMH ESRD, CAD s/p MI, CMP, seizure disorder and CVA,
s/p recent ICU hospitalization for MSSA sepsis w/ lung abscesses
 possible [**1-25**] HD line infection p/w continued fevers and
transient hypotension. After being discharged [**9-11**] for MSSA
sepsis thought to be [**1-25**] HD line infection pt was sent to rehab.
At [**Hospital 100**] rehab he was noted to have a temp of 103, transiently
hypotensive to 80s. EMS found him to be hypoxic. On admission to
the ED he was noted to be saturating 100% on NRB. When his NRB
was removed he desaturated to 89-91% on RA. He was also noted to
have a 1 time temp of 103 on rectal temp. His initial set of
vitals were noted to be T100.3, HR 103, BP 86/46. CXR was
obtained which showed progression of pleural effusion. Pt was
not given IV fluids but started on Vancoymcin and Zosyn. Labs
were significant for Lactate of 2.2, no leukocytosis but left
shift.

Past Medical History:
- h/o Hepatitis B, successfully treated
- Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 35-40% per echo in [**10/2115**]
- MI [**2086**] per pt
- CVA [**2086**] per pt (?residual LE weakness)
- ESRD on hemodialysis [**1-25**] HTN. [**2-1**] right thigh HD graft
placed. Removed from transplant list [**2-1**].
- History of MSSA TDC line infections.
- Multiple thrombectomies in LUE and R thigh AV fistula
- Graft excision for infected thight graft [**2117-5-26**]
- Seizure disorder, onset of seizures in mid [**2097**] after
starting dialysis. He seems to have seizures quite frequently at

dialysis, per neurology this seems to be attributed to both
non-compliance with the medications, as well as taking his
medications later on those days.
- Hungry bone syndrome status post parathyroidectomy
- Pituitary mass
- Anemia

The patient has a Ph.D. in history and had a successful academic
career until [**2103**], when he went on disability for unclear

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU on [**9-13**] for concern of fevers,
transient hypotension, and respiratory distress.

##. Fevers: Patient was noted to be febrile at rehab and in the
ED.  Patient met SIRS criteria based on temperature, pulse and
suspected source including prior diagnosis of pneumonia. Patient
also reported diarhea and in the setting of antibiotics and
hospitalization, a C. Diff toxin was sent and was negative.
Patient never had a WBC count but did have a left shift at
admission. Infectious Diseases was consulted which recommended
continuing Vancomycin, Zosyn and Ciprofloxacin (noting that this
may lower seizure threshold). They also requirested a diagnostic
thoracentesis which showed 240 WBC, 9250 RBC, 20 % PMN, 56 % L.
total protein 2.8, glucose 119, LDH 175, pH 7.43. Broad spectrum
antibiotics with Zosyn + Vancomycin for MRSA and pseudomonal
coverage. Sputum cultures grew out pseudomonas and MRSA swab was
pos.  Patient had some mild low grade fevers during his stay,
typical of his fever curve during his prior admission.

##. Hypoxia: Patient was noted to be hypoxic in the ED and was
initially noted to be on a non-rebreather saturating at 99 %.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was aggresively suctioned with
thick secretions returned and his saturations quickly improved.
Patient was also given albulterol and ipratropium nebs as needed
and underwent thoracentesis as documented above.  Sputum
cultures grew out pseudomonas and Vancomycin, Zosyn and
Ciprofloxacin were continued pending sensitivities.

##. Diarrhea: Patient was noted to have diarrhea at outside
rehab.  There was initial concern for C.Diff colitis considering
diarrhea in the setting of a recently hospitalized patient on
antibiotics. C.Diff toxin was sent which was negative.

##. ESRD: Patient is hemodilaysis dependend and initial
electrolyte panel showed now abnormalities.  Patient received HD
on [**9-14**] and was transfused 1 unit of PRBC's.

##. Tachycardia: Patient was initially noted to be tachycardic
in the ED which was attributed to a physiologic response to his
hypoxia and possible infection.  Patient was persistently mildly
tachycardic throughout prior admission.  Patient was continued
on telemtry throughout the admission.

##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2116**] shows an EF of 40%
as well as mild-moderate regional systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and septal walls.
Digoxin was continued.

##. Seizure d.o.: Home regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine
was continued.

##. FEN: Patient continued on hemodialysis.

##. Prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin

##. Code: FULL CODE
