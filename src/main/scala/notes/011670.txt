Allergies:
Ace Inhibitors / Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
54-year-old woman with a history of obesity hypoventilation,
COPD on home CPAP with multiple hospital admissions for
hypercarbic respiratory failure, OSA, panhypopituitarism,
pulmonary HTN, diastolic CHF, ASD with shunting presented with
weakness and was found to be hypoxic.
.
Of note, patient was discharged on [**2120-12-17**] after a 9-day
admission for hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
intubation.
.
In ED, T 98.4, HR 50, BP 106/62, RR 18, 99%RA. But then patient
desated to the 60s on room air and was placed on BIPAP. Her SBP
dropped to the 70s with HR to 30s. ECG showed sinus bradycardia.
Was given atropine with reportedly no response. She was started
on dopamine 10 mg/hr and intubated fiberoptically. OGT placed.
SBP gradually improved to 180s; dopamine was d/c'ed; SBP dropped
to 70s; dopamine was restarted. CXR showed severe cardiomegaly,
?unchanged from prior. Bedside u/s revealed pericardial
effusion. Head CT was negative by prelim. Chest CT showed no
clear dissection and minimal to no pericardial effusion. Cards
fellow saw patient, found no pulsus, thought bradycardia not
likely to cause hypotension; no indication for emergent pacer.
Got 2L of NS, vanco 1gm, pip-tazo 4.5 gm, solumedrol 125 mg.

Blood cultures ([**2120-12-27**] x2, [**2120-12-28**]): No growth to date.
.
EKG ([**2120-12-27**]): Sinus bradycardia with a single atrial premature
beat. Q-T interval prolongation. Since the previous tracing of
[**2120-12-7**] the rate is slower. Blocked atrial premature beat is no
longer seen.
.
CXR
([**2120-12-27**]): Markedly limited study. There is suggestion of edema
with
massive but stable cardiomegaly.
([**2120-12-28**]): The heart is markedly enlarged. Mediastinum is
within normal limits. There is patchy consolidation of the left
lower lobe with small left pleural effusion. The endotracheal
tube terminates at the thoracic inlet.  Nasogastric tube courses
towards the stomach but the tip is not seen. There is probable
mild congestive failure, which appears to have decreased
somewhat since the prior study.
([**2120-12-29**]): The heart is enlarged. The aorta is tortuous.
Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. The patient has been
extubated. There is mild congestive failure. There is no
appreciable change since the prior study.
.
CT head ([**2120-12-27**]): Prelim read, no intracranial hemorrhage or
edema.
.
CT chest non-contrast ([**2120-12-27**]): Prelim read, no pericardial
effusion,
no caliber change of aorta or intramural hematoma to suggest
dissection.
Ill-defined lingular opacity, bibasilar atelectasis.
.
Renal ultrasound ([**2120-12-27**]): No hydronephrosis.
.
TTE ([**2120-12-28**]): The left atrial volume is markedly increased
(>32ml/m2). The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet
is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional
and global LV systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction. Dilated
and hypokinetic RV with at least moderate tricuspid
regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Massive biatrial enlargement. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-8-22**], the findings are
similar. The right ventricular size was described as normal on
the prior study but it was dilated then also.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo F with panhypopituitarism, diastolic CHF,
obesity-hypoventilation and OSA recurrently admitted with
hypercarbic respiratory failure, admitted for the same.

The patient has a history of multiple and recent admissions for
hypercarbic respiratory failure. On the day of admission, the
patient presented to the ED with weakness, headache and
respiratory distress. She was noted to develop profound
shortness of breath and desaturated to the 60's% while in the ED
with ambulation to the bathroom. She was maintained on a 100%
NRB and CPAP while in the ED. Due to desaturation to 76% with
respiratory rate = of 33 and findings of hypercarbia to pCO2 76,
the patient was intubated by fiberoptic bronchoscope. She
received vancomycin, zosyn for a possible pulmonary infiltrate
and pulse dose solumedrol out of concern for a COPD
exacerbation. The patient was noted to have stable massive
cardiomegaly on CXR with possible volume overload. Initial [**Year (4 digits) **]
were remarkable for ARF (Cr 4.2), BNP >6000 and 2 sets of
negative cardiac enzymes (trop 0.02 and unchanged). Lactate was
2.1, improved to 1.5 on repeat 12 hours later. UA was noteworthy
only for some blood in the setting of foley placement and blood
and urine cultures were sent and without significant growth.
Head and chest CT without contrast were largely unremarkable
with some bibasilar atelectasis and an ill-defined lingular
opacity. The patient was admitted to the ICU and rapidly weaned
from the vent and successfully extubated on the day after
admission. Echocardiogram confirmed severe right heart failure
with associated mitral and tricuspid regurg. The patient had
received
