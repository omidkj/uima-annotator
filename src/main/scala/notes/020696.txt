Brief Hospital Course:
22yo female with history of DM Type 1 who presented with 3 days
of general malaise, nausea, polyuria, and polydipsia, and who
was found to be hyperglycemic with anion gap metabolic acidodis
on admission, consistent with DKA.
.
# DKA/DM Type 1:  Patient's initial presentation with polyuria,
polydipsia, malaise, nausea, hyperglycemia (FSBS 499), and anion
gap metabolic acidosis (bicarb 13, gap 32) consistent with
diabetic ketoacidosis.  She was started on IV fluids and insulin
gtt, and initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring.
Her anion gap closed overnight.  Insulin gtt was stopped, and
patient was transitioned to SC insulin.  She was transferred to
the general medicine floor, and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.  They
recommended patient continue on Levemir 34 units daily as an
outpatient, 10 units humalog with meals, and a humalog insulin
sliding scale to cover her for additional needs.  The trigger
for her DKA was unclear, though episode likely secondary to poor
control at baseline.  While patient has been taking her insulin
as prescribed, she has not been checking her sugars regularly at
home and per her report sugars were poorly controlled (often in
200s-300s). HbA1c was 10.9.  Infectious work-up, including UA
and CXR, was negative, and patient remained afebrile without
localizing signs or symptoms of infection during her hospital
[**Last Name (un) 10128**].  She will follow-up with a new PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also
follow-up in the [**Hospital **] Clinic for ongoing management of her
diabetes.  Patient was also seen by Nutrition consult this
admission for education about following a diabetic diet, and she
was instructed on the importance of checking her FSBS regularly.


LABS/STUDIES PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
MRSA screen

ISSUES REQUIRING FOLLOW-UP
-Patient will establish care with new PCP
[**Name9 (PRE) **] will need close follow-up at the [**Hospital **] Clinic, and
will likely need ongoing adjustment to her insulin regimen
-Patient may benefit from additional nutrition education as
outpatient

Medications on Admission:
- levemir 34U qam
- humalog 15U before meals

1. Levemir 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: Thirty Four (34) units

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 88807**],

You were admitted to the hospital with increased thirst,
increased urination, and nausea.  We found your blood sugars
were very high, and that your symptoms were due to a condition
called diabetic ketoacidosis.  We treated you with IV fluids and
insulin, and you quickly improved.  You were initially admitted
to the ICU for close monitoring, but were stable for transfer to
the general medical floor the following day.

You were seen by the doctors from the [**Name5 (PTitle) **] Diabetes Center,
who recommended you take:

-34 units of Levemir daily
-10 units of Humalog with each meal
-Humalog sliding scale four times a day (with 3 meals and at
bedtime):
---if sugar 201-250, take 2 extra units of humalog with each
meal or 1 extra unit at bedtime
---if sugar 251-300, take 4 extra units of humalog with each
meal or 2 extra units at bedtime
---if sugar 301-350, take 6 extra units of humalog with each
meal or 3 extra units at bedtime
---if sugar 351-400, take 8 extra units of humalog with each
meal or 4 extra units at bedtime

You may need to adjust this sliding scale at home, and it is
very important that you follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3617**] at [**Last Name (un) **] for
ongoing management of your diabetes.

It is also very important that you follow-up with your new
primary care provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 88808**], as scheduled.
