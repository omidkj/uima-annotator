Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital on the morning of
[**2145-10-14**] with a 2 days history of progressively worsening
lower extremity weakness. In the emergency department he had
complete paralysis of his RLE, with minimal movement in his LLE.
His initial labs demonstrated a WBC count of 15.2 with a normal
Hgb and HCT. He was placed on steriods, and a morning CT Scan
demonstrated a T10 compression fracture with retropulsion and
compression into the spinal cord. He was urgently taken to the
OR for a T7 to L1 laminectomy, decompression and fusion with
corpectomy and tumor debulking. Prior to the OR, he pulled out
his foley CA with the bulb inflated and had frank blood coming
from the tip of his penis. Urology was consulted and instructed
to replace the foley and irrigate as needed.

Perioperatively there was a period of hypotension, duration
unknown, please refer to Anesthesia records, secondary to over
medication. The patient was transferred to the ICU intubated.
Post operatively the patient had sensation in his lower
extremities, but was transiently plegic. A post op CT and MRI
done emergently did not show any epidural hematoma or overt cord
impingement or edema.  Over the next few days, on steroids the
patient regained near full motor strength.

He was ordered a TLSO brace and should wear this brace at all
times when out of bed and when the HOB is greater than 30
degrees.

he is being discharged to a rehab facility. He should follow up
with us as directed and also with his oncologist. He may resume
chemo or radiation as indicated in three weeks.
