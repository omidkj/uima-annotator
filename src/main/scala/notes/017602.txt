HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 76 year old female
who was referred to Dr. [**Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of critical
aortic stenosis.  By report, the patient has experienced
symptoms consistent with congestive heart failure since [**2119**].
An echocardiogram obtained at that time demonstrated a normal
left ventricular chamber size with concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy and impaired relaxation with
preserved systolic function and moderate aortic stenosis,
with a mean gradient of 22 millimeters of Mercury and mild
aortic insufficiency with trace to mild mitral regurgitation
and a dilated left atrium and ascending aorta.  The patient
underwent an exercise test in [**2119-12-30**] which
demonstrated no evidence of ischemic changes and heart rate
at 60% of predicted maximum at six minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.

A repeat echocardiogram obtained in [**2123-12-30**]
demonstrated an aortic valve with a mean gradient of 26
millimeters of Mercury and two plus aortic insufficiency
which did not appear significantly changed from her [**2121**]
study.

Symptomatically, the patient described progressive weakness
and diminishing endurance associated with shortness of
breath.  The patient underwent cardiac consultation on [**2126-3-7**], which concluded a cardiac catheterization notable
for moderate disease of the mid- left anterior descending
with mild disease of the circumflex and right coronary
arteries.  In addition, the study demonstrated a mildly
dilated proximal ascending aorta with what appeared to be a
trileaflet aortic valve with significant restriction of
systolic opening along with two plus aortic insufficiency.

The patient was subsequently referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
and thereafter recommended for aortic valve replacement, to
be scheduled on [**2126-3-26**].

ALLERGIES:   Morphine

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Originally from [**Country **]; lives with
daughter.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2126-3-26**], the patient underwent
an aortic valve replacement in conjunction with an aortic
root enlargement.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and had a cross clamp time of 108 minutes and a bypass time
of 131 minutes.  The patient's pericardium was left open,
lines placed including arterial lines and a Swan-Ganz
catheter; wires placed included both ventricular and atrial
wires.  Tubes placed included a mediastinal and right pleural
tubes.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac
Surgical Recovery Units, intubated, where she remained on
SIMD ventilation until the morning of [**3-27**].  The patient
was successfully extubated on postoperative day number one
and was subsequently cleared for transfer to the floor under
the direction of the cardiothoracic surgery service.

Prior to transfer, the patient's chest tubes were removed
without complication.  Postoperatively, the patient's
clinical course was uneventful and she progressed well.  On
postoperative day number two, the patient's Foley catheter
was removed without complication and she was subsequently
noted to be uneventfully productive of adequate amounts of
urine for the duration of her stay.

Evaluation by Physical Therapy suggested the patient was an
adequate candidate for short term rehabilitation following
discharge and the patient was subsequently screened by
extended care facilities for post-discharge care.

On the evening of postoperative day number two, the patient
demonstrated a run without complication.  Prolonged episode
of atrial fibrillation with good rate control and no evidence
of clinical compromise.  The patient was thereafter begun on
an amiodarone dosage schedule which was maintained for the
duration of her stay.

On postoperative day number three, the patient's pacer wires
were removed without complication.  The patient was
subsequently noted to be afebrile and stable with healing
incisional wounds and no evidence of discomfort.  The patient
was noted to be fully tolerant of p.o. intake and
independently productive of adequate amounts of urine.  The
patient was thereafter cleared for discharge to an extended
care facility with instructions for follow-up.

DISPOSITION:   The patient is to be discharged to an extended
care facility with instructions for follow-up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q. 12 hours.
2.  Docusate sodium 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o. q. four to six
hours p.r.n. for pain.
5.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day times three months.
6.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
9.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. 12 hours.
10. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. three times a day times one week
followed by amiodarone 200 mg p.o. three times a day times
three weeks.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient is to maintain her incisions clean and dry at
all times.
2.  The patient may shower, but she is to pat-dry the
incisions afterwards; no bathing or swimming.
3.  Regular diet.
4.  The patient is to limit physical exercise; no heavy
exertion.
5.  No driving while taking prescription pain medications.
6.  The patient is to start her amiodarone at 400 three times
a day initial doses scheduled by one week, followed by three
weeks of amiodarone at 200 mg p.o. three times a day.
7.  The rehabilitation facility has been advised to be aware
for prolonged QT intervals while the patient is dosed on
amiodarone.
8.  Should the patient continue to experience atrial
fibrillation, it is recommended that she be begun on a
Coumadin dosage schedule while at rehabilitation.
9.  The patient is to follow-up with her primary care
physician in one to two weeks following discharge.
10. The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Name (STitle) **] four
weeks following discharge.
11. The patient has been advised to call to schedule both
appointments.
