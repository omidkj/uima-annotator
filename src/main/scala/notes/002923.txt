Chief Complaint:
seizures, concern for status epilepticus

Intubation and subsequent extubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old right handed woman with a history
of seizures, leukodystrophy, dementia, feeding tube, presenting
as a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for status epilepticus.
 This history was taken over the phone from her Daughter;
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25807**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25808**].  She lives at home with her
and the patients husband who are her primary care givers.  She
is bedbound at baseline with quadraparesis with prominent
rightsided weakness.  This morning she was scheduled to see IR
today to have G tube replace at 3 pm.  This morning she had a
questionable small seizure with non responsiveness and quivering
of her lips but it was short lived.  Daughter; felt she had a
low grade temp and a mild cough, but no overt illness. On the
way to [**Hospital3 9717**] she went into a generalized tonic clonic seizure at 2:30
pm with was refractory to 5 mg of ativan, she was intubated at
3:30 for airway protection and was given a paralytic so it was
unclear if she was still seizing.  They got a head ct and
transferred her to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.

lidocaine 70 mg IV x 1
Fentanyl 120 mcg IV x 1
Rocuronium 36 mg IV x 1
Propofol gtt 10 mg / kg/ min
Zosyn 3.375 g IV x 1 sq

As far as her seizure history, they have been fairly well
controlled on Dilantin, with her lat seizure being months ago.
They are often generalized and recover her to come to the
emergency room.  Seizure began around the beginning of her
mental decline and discovery of her leukodystrophy back in 99,
she did have one seizure requiring intubation at that time.
Regarding
her Leukodystrophy, she had genetic testing at [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Last Name (un) 18355**]
School, she was tested for common for leukodystrophies and "they
all came up negative." But cognitive decline started in 99 with
slurred speech and weakness on one side, and wasn't sure if it
was MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25809**] and then had as seizure, has continued to
decline and has been bedbound for about 6 years.  Currently, her
neurologic baseline is that she has some movement of limbs,
weaker on right side; does move a little bit, but not much, she
fidgets a lot with her hands, rips blankets off and tips.

CT head [**2139-6-3**]:
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process. Severe chronic small
vessel
disease and atrophy.

CXR [**2139-6-3**]:
FINDINGS:  AP portable supine chest radiograph obtained.  The
endotracheal
tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 3.4 cm above
the carina.  The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen.
Contrast is seen within large bowel loops in the right upper
quadrant.  Linear areas of plate-like
atelectasis in the right and left lower lungs are noted.  There
is no large consolidation or signs of CHF.  No definite
pneumothorax is present.  The heart and mediastinal contours
appear grossly unremarkable aside from atherosclerotic
calcifications of the aortic knob.  No definite displaced rib
fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned endotracheal and
nasogastric tubes.

CXR [**2139-6-4**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged
position.  There is unchanged mild elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm.  The pre-existing right basal
atelectasis is improved.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No newly appeared
focal parenchymal opacities.


Brief Hospital Course:
64-year-old right handed woman with a history of seizures,
leukodystrophy, dementia, and G tube placement who presented as
a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for status epilepticus.
She had a GTC yesterday afternoon which was refractory to 5mg of
ativan and was subsequently intubated and paralyzed. Head CT
showed severe chronic small vessel disease and atrophy but no
acute intracranial process. Upon transfer she was continuing to
have some intermittent rhythmic movements of the left hand. She
was admitted to the neuro ICU for close monitoring.

ICU and Hospital course:

#Neuro: She was continued on her home Dilantin as well as a
propofol drip overnight and had no further evidence of seizure
activity. She was maintained on continuous EEG monitoring which
showed L sided slowing with polymorphic delta compared with R
sided theta but no epileptiform activity. She was extubated in
the am of [**6-4**] and quickly returned to her baseline, able to
answer simple questions appropriately and follow basic commands.
Dilantin level was 15.4. She received an extra 200mg dilantin on
[**6-4**] and her
