ADDENDUM:  Please refer to the previously dictated Discharge
Summary from [**2132-11-21**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Basically, Ms. [**Known lastname 11907**] has had three major issues since the
previous Discharge Summary.  First off, the patient stayed
through the weekend and her discharge date was [**11-24**]
instead of [**11-21**].

Her first complaint was that of some loose stools.  The loose
stools have been treated empirically with Flagyl, and two
Clostridium difficile cultures have come back as negative.
In addition, the patient has had two medications held at this
time.  Her Lipitor, which she reports at home, is associated
with some increased diarrhea as well as her Colace being
held.  Currently, at the time of discharge, her diarrhea had
improved relative to earlier this weekend.

Secondly, her sternal wound had its staples were removed on
the day of discharge prior to discharge.  The wound was
clean, dry, and intact.  Her leg wound still had a
vacuum-assisted closure device still in place.  There is no
leak about that site, and it continues to drain small amounts
of serosanguineous fluid.

In addition, she also had some continued drainage around her
right ankle and calf where her saphenous vein was harvested.
She is on day four of levofloxacin for these wounds, and she
was to continue this for 10 days at her rehabilitation
facility.
