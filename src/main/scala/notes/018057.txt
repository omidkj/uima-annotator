Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital1 1516**] service for diuresis

None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 year-old gentleman with a history of CAD s/p CABG,
systolic HF, and PVD s/p numerous revascularizations who
presented with worsening edema, SOB and LLE cellulitis. Patient
is a poor historian, but per report from wife, he recently
completed an outpatient course of antibiotics (name unknown) and
was noted to have pain and darkening of the L 1st toe over the
last week. No c/o fevers or chills. He has had weight gain over
the past week and has felt SOB at rest and on exertion, with
ankle edema, orthopnea and PND, but no CP. Of note, he was
admitted for CHF exacerbation and similar toe complaints
12/[**2127**].
.
In ED, VS T 96.7, BP 100/39, HR 98, 18, 100%RA. Pt was noted to
be somnolent. Pt received vanco and pip-tazo for dry
gangrene/osteo after two sets of blood cultures were obtained.
He was noted to have an elevated BNP and troponin and admitted
to cardiology for further eval and mgmt. He additionally
received 200cc NS bolus prior to transfer to the floor.
.
On the floor, he was to be started on a lasix gtt for diuresis,
but given SBP in the 80s, he was transferred to the CCU for
closer monitoring for diuresis.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient is drowsy, but in no acute
distress and denies current foot pain. He currently feels SOB
and has a dry cough. He notes having intermittent palpitations
and lightheadedness in the past, but denies these sx currently.
Also denies abd pain.

[**3-5**] CXR: 1. Retrocardiac opacity is concerning for pneumonia.
Probable small left pleural effusion.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly with no definite pulmonary edema.

[**3-5**] Foot Xray 1. Interval amputation of the left first digit
with irregularity of the amputation site and overlying soft
tissue ulcer. Osteomyelitis cannot be excluded in this location.

2. Increasingly poor visualization of the left fifth MTP joint,
which may be due to disuse osteopenia; however, again
osteomyelitis cannot be excluded.
3. Interval amputation of the right third digit.
Given the severe diffuse background osteopenia, if there is
continued clinical concern for osteomyelitis and it will change
clinical management, an MRI of is recommended.

[**3-7**] Echo: The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is mildly dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral
thinning/akinesis and hypokinesis of the anterior septum and
anterior wall. The apex and remaining segments contract well
(LVEF = 25%).The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with mild free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity
dilation and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Moderate pulmonary arteyr systolic
hypertension. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-11-17**],
the left ventricular cavity is slighly larger and anterior and
anteroseptal dysfunction is new c/w interim ischemia.Overall
systolic function is more depressed.


Brief Hospital Course:
A&P: 82 yo male with a hx of CAD s/p CABG, systolic HF, and PVD
presents with acute decompensated HF with LLE cellulitis and
infection of wound in distal forefoot.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic HF, EF 20-30%: Patient presented
with significant volume overload on exam and had a positive
heart failure ROS. BNP elevated to 8569. Unclear precipitant,
but possible etiologies include Na intake, hypertension,
ischemia, or worsening valvular dysfunction. [**Name (NI) 103331**] pt with
120mg IV furosemide and started gtt at 10mg/hr. He diuresed 1-2L
net negative daily and was continued on PO metolazone. Echo was
consistent with worsening EF and interim ischemia. His
lisinopril and carvedilol were continued with careful
observation of BPs. Patient's lasix gtt was uptitrated to
20mg/hr with continued improvement in urine output, hypoxia and
symptoms. His blood pressures improved with diuresis and were
stable.
.
# LLE ulcers and celllulitis: Started on empiric vanc and
pip-tazo per vascular recs. Vascular opted not to intervene
surgically. He remained afebrile with blood cultures negative to
date. At discharge, he was transitioned to TMP-SMX for an
additional 14 days.
.
# Pulmonary opacity: Retrocardiac opacity on CXR concerning for
PNA. Patient had a nonproductive cough, but no fevers. This was
felt to be well covered by his concurrent 7d course of
vancomycin and pip-tazo as mentioned above.
.
# CAD: S/p CABG [**10
