Imaging:
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with occasional ventricular ectopic
beats and rapid
ventricular response. Left axis deviation. RSR' pattern in lead
V2.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.

CT abdomen:
8. Two tiny air bubbles  within the liver, ? biliary vs. portal
venous.
Clinical correlation and correlation with any past surgical
history of biliary intervention is suggested.

1.  Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

2.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

3.  Numerous subcentimeter hypodensities within the liver,
incompletely
characterized on this non-contrast exam.

4.  Large exophytic cyst with punctate mural calcification
arising from the upper pole of the left kidney.

5.  Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the aorta.
There is no evidence of aneurysm or periaortic stranding. Small
eccentric calcification is identified within the aortic lumen,
which likely represents atherosclertotic calcification and less
likely an intimal flap. Evaluation is limited by lack of
intravenous contrasts.

6. Slight thickening of the cecal wall with adjacent strading.
Recommend
colonoscopy if clinically warrented.

7. Enlarged prostate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to surgical ICU. The GI medicine service
was consulted for lower GI bleeding.  A central venous
catetheter and Foley catheter were placed.  Patient made NPO.
IV Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and flagyl were started.  The
morning of HD1, patient became increasingly hypotensive,
requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.  After a family
meeting involving the patient, his health care proxy, the
general surgery team, and the ICU team, the decision was made to
make the patient DNR/DNI.  All medications were discontinued;
patient placed on morphine infusion for comfort.  That evening,
further discussions with patient and family resulted in code
status being changed to CMO.  The patient expired that evening.
