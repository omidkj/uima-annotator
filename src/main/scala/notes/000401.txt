Allergies:
Hydromorphone / Morphine / Amoxicillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 78 year old male with past medical history of CAD
NSTEMI, s/p CABG (LIMA to the LAD, SVG to OM1 and OM2) and St.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**] ([**12-12**]) with course complivated by wound dehisence,
chronic systolic dysfunction EF 30%, ESRD on HD, afib on
coumadin, stroke, chronic anemia, recent lower GI bleed with
bleeding rectal ulcers and CMV colitis, and chronic left-sided
pleural effusion transferred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for increasing
SOB and lethargy after receiving 1 unit PRBCs earlier today for
Hct 21; he recieved HD yesterday.  HD was stopped prematurely
yesterday due to hypotension to 60/40. His discharge weight on
[**2-15**] was 60 kg; he was 73 kg pre-dialysis on [**2-21**].  Of note,
patient was discharged on [**2-15**] from the [**Hospital1 **] service after a
similar presentation, with status improving after emergent
dialysis removing 10 liters and thoracentesis.  Course
complicated during this admission by presumed c. diff colitis
due to profuse diarrhea, treated with 14 days flagyl.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were T 97.2 HR 120 (afib)
BP 123/110 RR 20 100% 4L NC in acute respiratory distress.  Labs
significant for H/H 7.1 AND 21.0, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 89668**] INR 2.3.  He was
placed on BiPAP with resolution of respiratory distress.  Prior
to transfer, patient was started on levophed for SBPs in 80s.
.
On review of systems, he has a history of stroke, PE, bleeding
with surgery, deep venous thrombosis. He denies myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, severe SOB,
DOE, ankle edema, PND, Orthopnea, absence of chest pain,
palpitations.
.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be T97.2, HR 120, BP 123/110,
RR 20, Sat 100% on 4L.


Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
In [**2135-9-3**], per the patient's wife report, the patient
had a stent placed to the LAD and two other vessels and did well
on plavix, aspirin and coreg with an EF of 45%.  On [**2136-12-7**]
after episode of CP, the patient was admitted to OSH with non- Q
wave MI and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed 70%
LAD instent stenosis, 70-80% instent stenosis at the RCA and the
LCx had 90% stenosis and an
aortic valve area of 0.9cm.  He underwent a CABG LIMA to LAD
saphenous graft sequential to an OM1 and OM2 and [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital3 1291**].
Post -operatively course complicated by severe hyptnesion
requiring high dose pressor support with vasopressin,
epinephrine and levophed. A balloon pump was placed for several
days.  He required multiple blood products.  His post-op EF was
noted to be 30% per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab records. he was transferred to
[**Hospital 100**] rehab from OSH for an NSTEMI, [**Hospital 1291**] and CABG complicated by
multiple issues described below.
-CABG:  LIMA to LAD saphenous graft sequential to an OM1 and OM2
and [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital3 1291**] [**12-12**]
-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:  DES to LAD in [**2136**], prior

stent to RCA and LAD
-PACING/ICD:  none
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Chronic systolic dysfunction (EF 30%)
ESRD on HD
Chronic left-sided pleural effusion
Prior GI bleed - ?rectal ulcer
Hyperlipidemia
IDDM
chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin
Stoke with no residual neurologic deficits
Hypothyroid
AS s/p [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] [**Hospital3 **]
Hyperparathyroidism
Right AV fistula
Rectal Ulcers: CMV positive
Blood cultures during his prior hospitalization grew gram
negative rods speciated to Aeromonas hydrophilia for which he
was treated with
6 weeks of ciprofloxacin last day of therapy [**2137-2-5**].  During
this time he developed lower GI bleed, colonscopy revealed
rectal uclers which were cauterizated and biospy was CMV
positive.  Patient s/p 2 wks IV ganciclovir. Coumadin for afib
held and was restarted the nigth prior to admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
More recently on [**2-5**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, due to persistent
diarrhea, the patient was empirically started on Flagyl for
cdiff colitis

Social History:
-Tobacco history:  none
-ETOH:  none
-Illicit drugs: none
Married, former salesman, several children.  His wife and
children are very involved in his care.

CHEST XRAY [**2137-2-28**] IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with
pulmonary edema.
.
.
TTE [**2137-2-28**]
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %)
with regional variation (lateral wall relatively preserved). The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of 10 Janaury [**2137**], the tricuspid regurgitation appears reduced,
but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes
definitive comparison.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2137-2-28**]
1.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling
pressure
with a mean PCWP of 20 mmHg.  There was moderate pulmonary
hypertension
with a PA pressure of 60/28 mmHg.  Cardiac output was mildly
depressed
at 4.76 L/min with an index of 2.61 L/min/m2.
2.  The RVH sheath was coverted to a CVVH catheter following
right heart
cathterization.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Elevated left sided filling pressure
2. Moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension.
3. CVVH catheter placed.
.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS: [**2137-3-2**]
1. No CT evidence of colitis.
2. Stable appearance of bilateral pleural effusions and
compressive
atelectasis.
3. Stable small pericardial effusion.
.
.
TTE [**2137-3-4**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). R
