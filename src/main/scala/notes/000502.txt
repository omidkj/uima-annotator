Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 24166**] is a 54 y/o F with hx of long-standing T1DM,
long-standing tobacco abuse (recently quit) and chronic
osteomyelitis of the foot who came to the ED after calling EMS
for experiencing acute-onset shortness of breath while lying in
bed at home.  She denied chest pain or palpitations.  She was
found by EMS to be hypoxic to 70s on room air, with increased
work of breathing and tachycardia to the 110s.  She was given
nebulizers en route to the ED, without significant improvement.

In the ED, initial VS were: 99.2 120 216/80 32 92% with neb.
Exam notable for respiratory distress with accessory muscle use
and decreased breath sounds bilaterally with expiratory wheeze.
Labs revealed anemia slightly below baseline, normal WBC count,
hyperglycemia > 600, hyponatremia, mild anion gap metabolic
acidosis, normal cardiac biomarkers, and BNP 2500.  ECG
demonstrated sinus tachycardia @ 141 bpm with lateral ST
depressions.  CXR showed vascular prominence and cephalization
of the vessels, with LLL consolidation.  The pt was given
increasing amounts of supplemental O2 but remained hypoxic; she
was started on CPAP with improvement in O2 sats and respiratory
rate.  Her hypertension was treated with nitro gtt.  She was
started on heparin gtt for empiric treatment of ACS and PE.  She
was given 8 units regular insulin; fingerstick was not
rechecked.  Bedside echo did not reveal ventricular dysfunction
or tamponade.  Pt was given 20 mg IV furosemide.  Vitals prior
to transfer were HR 120, RR 18, BP 165/62 O2 100% on CPAP.

On arrival to the MICU, she reports significant relief in
regards to her breathing.  She denies cough, fever, sick
contacts. She has never experienced similar symptoms.  Her last
fingerstick check was with breakfast yesterday, when it was 101.

Of note, the patient was seen in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED yesterday
afternoon, after her outpatient provider referred her for
nausea, vomiting, and lateral ECG changes. She had two negative
troponins and no stress test, and was discharged home.

ECHO [**2119-12-6**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The number
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall
motion abnormality. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild right
ventricular dilation with normal function.  Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-11-16**], estimated pulmonary
artery pressure is mildly elevated (previously undetermined).

CT chest w/o contrast [**2119-12-6**]:
1. Lytic process T2 vertebral body and small associated
paravertebral soft
tissue mass could be infectious or malignant. Dedicated neuro
imaging
recommended for assessment of the spinal canal.
2. Moderate left and small right nonhemorrhagic layering pleural
effusions
may have increased slightly since [**19**]:00 a.m. No evidence of
extensive
pneumonia, but small areas of infection could be missed given
the large scale
left lower lobe atelectasis and smaller atelectasis at the right
base.
3. Numerous borderline bilateral axillary lymph nodes and
possibly in the
left hilus, and less extensive lymph node enlargement in the
mediastinum.

MRI w/o contrast [**2119-12-7**]:
Compression fracture of T2 with signal abnormalities involving
the adjacent T1/T2 and T2/T3 intervertebral disc spaces and T1
as well as T3 enplates. Small contiguous anterior paraspinous
soft tissue component.
Differential diagnosis includes osteomyelitis or, far le
