[**2118-2-22**] TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic or
the mitral valve. Normal overall LV systolic function
<br>

[**2118-2-18**] Echo (TTE):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2116**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Assessment/Plan:
58 yo M with alcohol withdrawal and pneumonia transferred from
OSH, called out of the ICU, found then with high grade
bacteremia with coag neg staph - treatment with vancomycin
(14day) and 10d ceftriaxone - d/c to [**Hospital 19586**] rehab.  Details
as below.

# Pneumonia, bacterial w/assoc respiratory failure and
sepsis/bacteremia : Seen on OSH CXR as RLL infiltrate. Now with
coag-neg staph bacteremia as well. Treated initially with
ceftriaxone, azithromycin and clindamycin.
- ceftriaxone and clindamycin started [**2-15**]
-Started on vancomycin [**2-19**]
Sensitivities showing clinda resistance - d/c clinda
- contin Vanc and CTX
-plan for completing [**9-19**] day course of ceftriaxone (more for
PNA) - end date [**2118-2-25**]
