History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14637**] is a 36 M with a history of HIV not on HAART,
non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of [**10-17**]%, and
chronic transaminitis who presents with worsening dyspnea on
exertion. He states that since his last hospitalization
(discharged [**2137-6-18**]), he has been taking his medications as
prescribed. However, while he has felt occasionally well for
days at a time, every 3-4 days he has a "bad" day where he feels
very ill, though the nature of symptoms on bad days has varied.
On this occasion, he began feeling poorly on Saturday, when he
had decreased energy and also developed non-productive cough. He
is not aware of having had fever at home, and no chills. He
noted worsening DOE over this time interval as well, though he
is now fairly limited at baseline in terms of what he is able to
tolerate in the way of activity (has had to scale back his
dog-walking business). He was out with his dogs today when one
ran away, and he was forced to [**Male First Name (un) **] it. When he caught up with
the dog, he was nauseous and vomited x 1. He also felt extemely
weak and SOB. As he had also noticed that his weight has
increased by 3.5 lbs since Friday, he called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who
instructed him to come into the ED for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.3, HR 129, BP 100/80, RR
18, 100% on RA . He was given mg IV furosemide given his history
of heart failure. D-dimer returned positive, so CTA was done but
negative for PE. Abdominal CT and CXR did not reveal acute
pathology. He received morphine for pain control (atypical chest
pain, abdominal pain). During his time in the ED, he was
tachycardic to 100s-130s and tachypneic to 40s. He was evaluated
by the cardiology fellow and started on nitro gtt before
transfer to the CCU. At the time of transfer, vitals were T
97.4, HR 121, BP 95/78, RR 42, SaO2 100% 3L NC.
.
On arrival to the floor, he remains dyspneic and also nauseous,
though says his breathing is slightly better than on
presentation. He has continued chest/abdominal pain which was
slightly improved by morphine in the ED.
.
On review of systems, he endorses chest pani (chronic/constant,
"tightness" in center chest) and abdominal pain (worst in the
epigastrum, associated with belching and a sensation of
bloating, feels like "a knot or something hard....like after you
get punched") which is brought on by palpation but not present
at rest. He also reports pain in his right calf since earlier
today. He has had episodes of orthopnea at home, to the point
where a few nights ago he was forced to sleep in a chair because
it was the only way he could feel comfortable. He reports
diarrhea with up to [**6-4**] bowel movements per day, yellowish, no
blood, of varying volumes. He is awakened from sleep by the
diarrhea. He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors though
does get occasional nightsweats. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
