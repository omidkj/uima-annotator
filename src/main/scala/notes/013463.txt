Allergies:
Penicillins / Codeine / Pork Derived (Porcine)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.) Placement of left internal jugular central venous line
[**2153-5-9**]
2.) Placement of arterial line [**2153-5-9**]
3.) Endotracheal Intubation [**2153-5-9**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17204**] is a 56 year-old man with end-stage COPD on 2L home
O2 (FEV1 19% predicted, baseline pCO2 50s), CAD s/p CABG and
bare metal stent, with recent hospitalizations (>10 in the past
year) presenting with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion,
increased oxygen requirement to 3.5L, and worsened cough
productive of green sputum x 4 days. His symptoms have been
gradually worsening so that he feels short of breath even at
rest, whereas at baseline he can walk one block without rest. He
is a current smoker (a few cigarettes per day) but has recently
decreased his tobacco use. He also endorses a chronic history of
intermittent left-sided chest pain that lasts for seconds to
minutes while at rest, occurs once each day, and last occurred
in the emergency department. The pain radiates to his left ribs
and shoulder blade; he does not take nitroglycerin for it. He
denies any current chest pain. He denies any symptoms of
fevers/chills, night sweats, no abdominal pain or diarrhea, no
urinary symptoms, no difficulties swallowing. He denies seasonal
allergies, sick contacts, symptoms of edema or increased dietary
sodium intake. Compliance with medications is difficult to
assess, as patient is unable to identify medications and states
he is taking those listed per [**Hospital1 18**] computer system.

Of note, the patient was recently seen [**2153-4-27**] in COPD [**Hospital 702**]
clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who reduced his prednisone dose from 60
to 40 mg qday and prescribed doxycycline to be used PRN for COPD
exacerbation symptoms as a preventative measure to
hospitalization. It is unclear if the patient has taken the
doxycycline at home. He was also seen in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**2153-5-3**] for
cellulitis of his left elbow, for which he was treated with a
planned 7-day Bactrim and Clindamycin course and subsequent
course of Bactrim prophylaxis, the Clindamycin was discontinued
a day later at Urgent Care due to minimization of risk of C.
diff. His most recent dose of Bactrim was a prophylactic dose,
although the 7-day period for treatment is not completed. Mr.
[**Known lastname 17204**] states that his left elbow is infected as a result of
chronically leaning on it in bed.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department, initial vital signs were:
96.5 103 162/74 24 94%. His serum laboratory values were
significant for a WBC of 13 with 85% neutrophils, no bands. EKG
demonstrated prominent, peaked P waves with poor R wave
progression (also present on [**2153-4-23**] EKG). Troponin was negative
x1. Blood cultures were taken and CXR demonstrated no pneumonia
by preliminary read. He received Duonebs x3, IV
methylprednisolone, and a dose of IV Azithromycin. He also
received 4 mg IV Morphine for chronic low back pain, s/p
orthopedic surgery for spinal stenosis.

Past Medical History:
1.) COPD on 2L home O2 overnight
2.) CAD s/p MI and CABG; PCI [**5-/2150**]: patent LIMA to the LAD,
RIMA to the RCA, BMS placed in the RCA distal to RIMA; Cath
[**12/2150**]: widely patent LIMA and RIMA grafts; patent distal RCA
stent and known occluded native LAD and RCA. Nuclear Stress
[**1-/2151**] Nuclear Perfusion Stress: no anginal symptoms or ischemic
ST segment changes.
4.) Thoracic aortic anuerysm s/p repair [**2148**]
5.) Tobacco abuse; 1ppd since age 21
6.) Hypercholesterolemia
7.) Hypertension
8.) History of head trauma in [**2118**] from MVA with post-traumatic

grand mal seizure, now off anti-epileptics
9.) Neurogenic claudication
10.) S/p spinal stenosis surgery [**1-/2152**], previously on 10 mg
oxycodone qday for pain, recently violated narcotics contract

Social History:
Patient lives with his sister-in-law and her young children.
Endorses 30 pack-year tobacco history, now smokes 1 pack
q2weeks. Has previous history of 16-30 beers/day, states he has

Family History:
Family history of CAD, with death of mother at age 59 of MI,
father at age 61 of MI, cousin at age 41 of MI, uncle at age 41
of MI.  Has sister with severe COPD; brother died of throat
cancer.
