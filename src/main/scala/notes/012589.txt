.
IMAGING:
Chest X Ray [**9-15**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to
[**9-15**]:

Interstitial abnormality in the lungs has cleared substantially
consistent with resolved edema. Severe cardiomegaly persists.
There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
Transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead follows
the expected course.
.
Duplex Abd/Pelvis [**9-19**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Patent hepatic vasculature.
2. Moderate to large amount of sludge in the gallbladder, which
is not distended. Gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid
and ascites fluid likely relate to third spacing in this
patient.
.
Cardiac Cath [**9-21**]: COMMENTS:
 1. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal pulmonary capillary
wedge
pressures (14mmHg mean PCWP) with moderate pulmonary
hypertension
(pulmonary artery pressures of 50/12 mmHg).  Cardiac output was
above
normal with cardiac index of 3.8 L/min/m2.
 2. Tailored therapy with dobutamine 20 mcg/kg/min and
ultimately
nitroprusside 1.5 mcg/kg/min improved cardiac index to 4.5
L/min/m2 with
simultaneous reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance to 1.8
Wood
units, which demonstrated adequate reversibililty of pulmonary
vascular
resistance to remain a viable candidate for cardiac
transplantation.
 3. Left femoral pulmonary artery catheter was left in place at
65 cm
from the distal tip to the femoral sheath.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
2. Above normal cardiac output and normal filling pressures at
baseline
on dobutamine 15 mcg/kg/min.
3. Adequate reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance on trial
of
dobutamine and nitroprusside to confirm that pulmonary
hypertension is
reversible.
.
ECHO [**9-26**]: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The inferior vena cava is
dilated (>2.5  cm). Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity  is mildly dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.  [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given
the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is  mildly dilated. There is moderate global right
ventricular free wall  hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with  good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets  are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.  There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no  pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-9-3**],
right and left  ventricular systolic function are slightly
improved. The severity of mitral  regurgitation is reduced. Left
ventricular cavity size is also slightly  smaller. The heart
rate has increased. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension  is
now present.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 48 yo M with h/o idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF
15-20%) s/p AICD [**2159-8-7**] and RUE DVT who represents after d/c on
[**2159-9-13**] with c/o chest pain, now transferred for decompensated
CHF.  Labs notable for hyperkalemia, and elevated INR and LFTs,
improved on inotrope therapy with milrinone, evaluated for
possible cardiac transplant.
.
1# Cardiac:
A. Pump: Pt w/ h/o idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, EF < 20%.
S/p AICD placement.  On transfer was found to be in cardiogenic
[**Date Range **] (LFT's acutely rose to high thousands and had ARF, altered
MS). Treated with dobutamine and dopamine and clinically
improved and began diuresing.  We stopped spironolactone,
valsartan, digoxin, lasix d/t rising Cr.  Also stopped
metoprolol given decompensated CHF.  A right heart cath [**9-21**]
with resting PCWP 14mmHg mean with moderate pulm HTN, CI 3.8.
Tailored therapy with dobutamine 20 and nitroprusside 1.5
improved CI to >4.5 with decreased Pulm vascular resistance to
1.8 Wood units ->pt is suitable candidate for heart transplant.
Milrinone was added
