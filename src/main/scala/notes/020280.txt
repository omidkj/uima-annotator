[**2194-8-8**]:  EKG:

Sinus tachycardia with an atrial premature beat. Since the
previous tracing  of [**2194-7-16**] the rate is faster. ST segment
abnormalities are now present.

[**2194-8-8**]:  EKG:

Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to
the previous tracing there is no definite change.

[**2194-8-8**]:  cat scan of the head:

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. No subfalcine herniation.
3. No fracture.
4. Right subgaleal frontal hematoma.

[**2194-8-8**]: cat scan of c-spine:

IMPRESSION:

Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes in the cervical spine
gives suboptimal evaluation of the spine.
Lucent line through the left C5 transverse foramen could be a
fracture line; correlate with point tenderness.
If clinically concerning, consider CTA neck to exclude vessel
injury.

[**2194-8-8**]:  X-ray of right forearm:

 RIGHT WRIST: Degenerative changes are seen at the first and
second
carpometacarpal joints and triscaphe joint. No evidence of
fracture or
dislocation at the wrist. There is some widening of the
scapholunate
interval.

RIGHT FOREARM: There is a fracture at the distal ulna, minimally
impacted and with medial displacement of the distal fracture
fragment of 6 mm. No
radiopaque foreign body is seen.

[**2194-8-8**]: chest x-ray:

1.  Mild cardiac decompensation.
2. There is no displaced rib fracture

[**2194-8-8**]: cat scan of the head:

IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of bilateral subarachnoid
hemorrhage and
right frontal subgaleal hematoma. No new hemorrhage, large
vascular
territorial infarct, or mass effect.




Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to the acute care service after falling.  Upon
admission, she was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, and
underwent imaging of the head, neck, and right arm.  She was
reported to have sustained bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages.
Her initial lab work did indicate a bump in her troponin levels,
they have currently normalized.   She was evaluated by
Neurosurgery who made recommendations for a follow-up cat scan
upon discharge.  No immediate neuro-surgical interventions were
warrented at this time unless there was a change in her status.
She was also evaluated by Orthopedic/Spine/Trauma.  She was
placed in a cervical collar upon admission, but it was
clinically cleared for removal.  An x-ray of her right upper
extremity did show a fracture at the distal ulna, minimally
impacted and with medial displacement of the distal fracture
fragment.  No surgical intervention was needed.  Occupational
therapy placed a ulnar-gutter splint to her right arm.   During
her hospitalization, she was found to have a urinary tract
infection and started on an antibiotic. She was also evaluated
by the Geriatric service because of occasional episodes of
agitation. Upon there evaluation, she was found not to exhibit
any signs of delirium.
Her vital signs are stable and she is afebrile.  She is
tolerating a regular diet and voiding without difficulty.  She
has been evaluated by the Social Worker.
She is preparing for discharge to an extended care facility for
further evaluation and continued care.  She has been cleared by
neuro-surgery to resume aspirin.

Of note:  she will need physical therapy evaluation prior to
discharge home
