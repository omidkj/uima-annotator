ATTENDING:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9753**]
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
male who was basically diagnosed with hepatocellular
carcinoma with metastasis.  The patient began experimental
chemotherapy on [**9-30**].  The patient presented to the
[**Hospital **] Clinic on [**10-3**] with the complaints of
orthopnea and lower extremity edema, which was felt to be
consistent with CHF.  The patient was given 20 mg IV Lasix
and sent home with 40 mg Lasix PO.  At home, the patient
reportedly diuresed about 5 kg overnight and then
subsequently developed weakness and vomiting on
[**10-4**], [**2136**].  The patient was seen at the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department on the [**10-4**] for worsening shortness of breath.  The patient had a
hypertensive and bradycardiac episode in the emergency
department that that was afebrile.  The patient was noticed
to be lethargic with oxygen saturations 95% on room air.  EKG
showed no changes.  Labs were notable for acute renal
failure, increased white blood count.  The patient was given
IV fluids for low blood pressure and subsequently developed
increased shortness of breath.  ABGs were 7.04, 87, 102.  The
patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Initial bedside echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis with
ejection fraction of 25% to 30%.  The patient was transferred
to the MICU and started on dopamine drip for hypertension.

Ceftazidime and Vancomycin were initiated before possible
sepsis.

The hospital course was notable for the following:
1.  HYPERTENSION:   It was unclear whether the etiology of
hypertension was sepsis versus cardiogenic versus hypovolemia
secondary to over diuresis.  The patient responded well to IV
fluids, pressors were weaned off.  Subsequently, the patient
became hypertensive and less volume overloaded.  He was given
IV Lasix 20 mg times two with urine output.  The patient was
determined to be highly Lasix sensitive.  The patient was
started on Losartan, Hydralazine, and titrated up on these
medications.  IV Nipride was used in the MICU for help in
blood pressure control.

2.  BRADYCARDIA:  Bradycardia was felt to be secondary to
calcium channel blocker and beta blocker in the setting of
acute renal failure; resolved after starting these
medications.

3.  CHF:  CHF in the setting of volume overload.  The patient
had positive troponin, but negative CKMBs.  Repeat
echocardiogram showed increased mitral regurgitation from 2+
to 4+.  Focal akinesis in the septum and apex, as compared to
global hypokinesis on the first echocardiogram, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction
increased from 30% to 35%, as compared to 25 to 30 initially.

Echocardiogram findings and troponin were felt to be
secondary to strain secondary to increased blood pressure.
IV Nipride was used in the MICU to help with afterload
reduction.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was initially on Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin.  Ceftazidime was changed to Cefepime for
possible sepsis.  No source was identified.  Elevated white
count could have been secondary to steroids.  The patient
completed seven days Cefepime on [**10-10**].  Chest x-rays
were positive for possible atelectasis versus infiltrates.

ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Suspected per renal etiology versus
drug toxicity.  BUN and creatinine was normalized at the end
of the unit stay.  The patient had been getting IV Lasix 20
mg IV once a day.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was intubated for
hypercarbic failure.  The patient had some issues with
delicate fluid balance.

ANEMIA:  Hematocrit trended downwards.  Stool guaiacs were
negative.  Hemolysis labs were negative.

DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was covered by regular
insulin sliding scale.

Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] was transferred to the regular floor from the MICU
on [**10-11**].  He did very well after that.  He began
ambulation the next day.  Repeat echocardiogram was done on
the day of discharge on [**10-14**].  The results of the
repeat echocardiogram were pending at the time of this
dictation.  Hematocrit remained stable.  The patient was
discharged to home with VNA services on a regular diet on the
following medications:

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg PO q.d.
2.  Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for ten days.
3.  Lasix 10 mg PO q.d.
4.  Atenolol 25 mg PO q.d.
5.  Losartan 75 mg PO q.d.
6.  Hydralazine 25 mg PO q.6h.
7.  Glyburide 1.25 mg PO q.d.
8.  Colace one tablet PO q.d.
9.  Multivitamins one PO q.d.
10. Tylenol 325 mg to 650 q.6.p.r.n.

The patient needed repeat CBC every week for two weeks and
electrolytes checked in one week after discharge.  The family
is to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from hematology/oncology with the
results.  Telephone #:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9754**].

FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS:  Appointments to be scheduled by the
patient with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5762**] in two
weeks.
