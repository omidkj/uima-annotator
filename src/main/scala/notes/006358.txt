Status post cardiac arrest.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74283**] is a 46 year old male with past medical history
notable for dilated alcoholic cardiomyopathy who presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] after a witnessed arrest at home earlier on the day of
admission. The patient went to see his usual cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11850**], at [**Hospital6 **] in the early afternoon.
After his appointment, he went to his brother's house where he
was noted to be intoxicated and c/o shortness of breath. The
patient's brother then noted that he "gurgled" for about one
minute while making a grunting noise; the patient typically has
pain and did not complain of any chest pain, back pain, or
palpitations/dizziness at the time per the patient's brother.
The patient "passed out," and the patient's brother initiated
CPR while EMS was called.

On EMS arrival, the patient was shocked X 1 with AED (rhythm not
documented). He then had bradycardic PEA and received a total of
3 mg epi and 2 mg atropine. He regained a rhythm with rapid a
fib. The CPR appears to have lasted about 25 minutes total. The
patient was intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital 31145**]. At [**Hospital3 4298**] he received lopressor 5
mg IV X 2. At that point, his BPs dropped to 60/40 and he was
placed on dopamine with recovery of pressures in to the 90s
systolic.

Labs at OSH revealed K 4.1, creatinine 0.9, WBC 11.5, Hct 48,
Plt 226. ABG showed 7.32, pCO2 30, pO2 307, FiO2 100%, He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **]; en route, dopamine was
turned off and patient was switched to levophed on arrival here.
A right femoral line was placed in the ED.

On arrival to the floor, the patient was on levophed which was
switched back to dopamine. An a line was placed in the left
radial artery.

ROS: Unable to obtain as patient was sedated & intubated.

Pertinent Results:
EKG from OSH demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a rate of 90.
Normal axis. Flipped T waves in V5-6. T waves biphasic in V4. ST
segments < 0.5 mm depressed in V6.

EKG here: atrial fibrillation at rate of 80. normal axis.
flipped t waves v4-6. no st segment changes noted.

TELEMETRY demonstrated: atrial fibrillation
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2196-11-29**] demonstrated: dilated LV
(66 mm ed and 57 mm es), EF 25%, mild MR, dilated LA, LV
systolic function severely impaired with diffuse LV hypokinesis
and symmetric LVH, mild TR, RV systolic pressure 41
* Previous echo ([**12/2196**]) with EF 52%

TTE [**2197-5-27**]:  LV cavity severely dilated with severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). moderately dilated RV cavity. moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. no AR. mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR [**5-26**]: profound cardiomegaly, likely fluid overload
CXR [**6-2**]: Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette is unchanged. Left pleural effusion if any is small,
without increase. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
mediastinal venous engorgement persist.

EEG [**5-28**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the
frequent left more than right frontal spike or sharp and slow
wave discharges as well as the slow and disorganized background
rhythm. These are suggestive of bilateral frontal potential foci
of epileptogenesis. The slow and
disorganized background rhythm is suggestive of a mild to
moderate
encephalopathy which may be seen with medication effect, toxic
metabolic
abnormalities, infections, or global ischemic injury. There were
no
electrographic seizures noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 46yoM with a PMH of HTN, DMII, chronic afib, alcoholism,
and EtOH cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%) with PEA/cardiac arrest s/p
prolonged resuscitation. Hospital course by problem is as
follows:

#) Arrythmia/arrest: Most likely VT or VF arrest. The etiology
for arrest is uncertain. MI was unlikely given relatively small
size of CE elevation. Rise in CEs were likely secondary to
prolonged resuscitation and multiple shocks. Electrolyte
abnormality unlikely given stable lytes at presentation to OSH.
Most likely, arrest was precipitated by fluid overload in the
setting of medication noncompliance (patient reportedly was not
taking meds for a few days prior) and ETOH binge.

The patient remained in atrial fibrillation upon admission and
had episodes of tachycardia,(as high as 160s, and sustained in
130s) so esmolol drip was intiated for HR control (goal 90-110)
but discontinued shortly thereafter due to hypotension.  On [**5-27**]
the patient was started on amiodarone to prevent arrhythmias;
however, cardioversion x 5 was done in attempt to convert the
patient back to sinus rhythm. This was achieved only briefly
(<30seconds) and 2 attempts were repeated again on [**5-28**] but were
not successful. Amiodarone was restarted until [**5-30**] when the team
opted for rate control via metoprolol instead. The patient was
maintained on heparin gtt for anticoagulation.

#) Cardiac/ pump: Patient was initially started on levophed to
maintain BP after hypotension occurring during resuscitation
([**12-30**] lopressor administration), but was then started on
