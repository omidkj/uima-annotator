History of Present Illness:
45 y/o F with h/o cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, Hep B, Hep C,
current EtOH and former heroin abuse, seizure in the setting of
EtOH and drug use who was found down on [**4-17**] by her husband
under her kitchen table for an unknown length of time. She was
taken to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] where at 12:40 pm she had a witnessed 30
second generalized tonic-clonic seizure for which she was given
2 mg of IM Ativan with resolution of seizure. A head CT showed a
SDH. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgery eval. On
[**4-15**] she reported falling down 9 stairs after drinking, and
hitting a wall with her head and L shoulder.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was febrile to 103.8. Pt was given 2 gm IV
Ceftriaxone, 2 gm IV vancomycin, and 10 mg dexamethasone and was
loaded with 1 gm Dilantin. Neurosurgery, trauma surgery, and
neurology were consulted. Head CT was repeated which showed a
left temporparietal SDH max thickness 10 mm with a 2 mm midline
shift. Neurosurgery and trauma surgery did not feel there were
any acute surgical issues and patient was admitted to the MICU.

.
CT head:There is a left temporoparietal subdural hematoma. The
maximal thickness is measured as 10 mm. There is a 2 mm

temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. The basal cisterns
are preserved without evidence of transtentorial herniation. No

TTE [**4-22**]: The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 y/o F with history of Hep B, Hep C, EtOH abuse, and prior
seizure in setting of alcohol and drug use in the past who was
admitted after being found down on [**4-17**], with witnessed seizure
and subdural hemorrhage.  In the MICU she was initially
combative, receiving ativan/haldol at a Code Purple. Recommended
LP could not be performed, and she was empirically started on
vanco, ctx 2g, and acyclovir for possible meningitis. Her fevers
improved. EEG showed no active seizure activity but she was
continued on dilantin. She was given valium per CIWA scale. Her
mental status improved and patient was A&O x 3 upon transfer to
the floor, although she had no memory of what happened to her
other than falling. She complained of pain in her left shoulder
and lower back.
.
1) Seizure: The patient was started on ceftriaxone, vancomycin,
and acyclovir for possible meningitis/encephalitis.  This was
discontinued on the floor.  Her dilantin was continued per
neurology recomendations, with therapeutic dilantin levels.
.
2) Fever: She had a low-grade temperature upon transfer to the
floor.  She had no clear infectious source with neg U/A and neg
CXR.  Her fever curve improved by discharge.  Blood cultures
remained negative to date.
.
3) Subdural hematoma: CT findings appear to be stable; there was
no acute indication for surgery.  Neurology and neurosurgery
consulted on this patient.  She was put on dilantin for 4 weeks.
 She needs repeat CT scan and EEG in 6 months time.
.
4) Altered MS/agitation: This was much improved upon transfer to
the floor.  Psychiatry followed the patient.  She improved with
valium for etoh withdrawal.
.
5) Tachycardia: This remained stable during her admission, with
sinus tach on EKG.  She took adequate POs, had a stable Hct, and
was continued on CIWA scale with valium.
.
6) Cardiomyopathy: This was recently diagnosed at NWH in [**2-23**].
Workup was initiated and records are in chart.  Her cardiac
