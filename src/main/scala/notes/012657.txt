History of Present Illness:
46 yo M with h/o DMI, ESRD on HD, HIV(VL <50, CD4 393 [**2-13**]),
recently diagnosed PE, and multiple ED admissions for HTN
emergency, nausea, and vomiting who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2109-7-6**]
with acute onset SOB, nausea, and vomiting. Patient had been in
his usual state of health prior and went to usual HD session
[**2109-7-5**] where reportedly had the standard amount of UF taken
off. That evening, he felt acutely SOB with nausea and
subsequent vomiting. He denied any associated chest pain,
palpitations, lightheadedness, focal numbness or weakness, or
changes in vision although he did note headache at that time.
.
Of note, he last took his po meds yesterday afternoon but has
since been unable to take po meds due to nausea and vomiting. Of
note, he has been admitted with similar symptoms 5 times since
[**3-/2109**], three times in last month prior. On recent admission was
found to have chronic PEs that are of unclear relation, but was
started on anticoagulation. On his most recent admission
[**Date range (3) 94521**], he was admitted to the ICU and was initially
managed with Nipride gtt which was transitioned to NTG gtt.  He
was then transitioned to his oral regimen and was discharged
with the addition of clonidine patch.  He refused to stay until
his INR was therapeutic.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were signifanct for SBP in 230s.
He was given lopressor 5 IV without any change in BP.
Subsequently given hydralazine 10 IV X 1 followed by hydralazine
20 IV X 2 with minimal improvement in blood pressure. CTA was
performed for c/o SOB which showed new PEs in RLL but decrease
in size of other chronic PEs.
He was started on a nitro gtt and was transferred to the floor.

.
On the floor, patient continued to complain of HA and nausea.
However, he was able to take valsartan 160 mg po x1. He felt his
SOB was improved.  He was continued on the nitro gtt with SBPs
remaining in the 200s.  Renal was consulted but noted that
patient was at his new dry weight and did not feel that there
was significant volume contribution to current presentation.  He
received labetolol 20 mg IV x 1 with response in his SBP to
170s.  However, required a second dose for return of SBPs to
200s with again drop to 170s.  He continued to complain of mild
HA and nausea but but otherwise denied CP, SOB, lightheadedness,
numbness, tingling, vision changes, abdominal pain.  He was then
transferred to the ICU for further management.
