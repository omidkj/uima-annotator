Imaging
CXR [**2110-1-6**]: FINDINGS: Lung volumes are low. There is pulmonary
vascular prominence. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
or pneumothorax is appreciated on this single frontal view.
Deformity of the right humerus is again noted, partially imaged.


CT Scan [**2110-1-6**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No soft tissue gas in the left lower extremity. Extensive
fascial and subcutaneous edema but no intramuscular edema. No
drainable fluid collection.
2. Moderate to severe anasarca and moderate to large amount of
ascites, both increased since [**2109-10-5**]

RUQ u/s ([**1-6**]):
1. Partial thrombosis of the right portal vein, probably
decreased somewhat.
2. Bidirectional but predominantly hepatofugal flow in the right
portal vein.
