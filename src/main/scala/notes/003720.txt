DATE OF DEATH:  [**2151-5-31**], at 5:38 p.m.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post fall.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 84-year-old female after a
fall from standing for unknown reason. The patient had
respiratory arrest and brief asystole. The patient was
intubated at the scene and brought to the emergency
department. The patient was found to be flaccid on initial
exam. The patient had a CT of the head and C-spine. C-spine
showed a comminuted type 2 dense fracture nearly 30 degrees
of leftward rotation of C1 on C2.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, history of multiple PEs,
interstitial lung disease on home O2, room air saturating
around 88% to 89%, diabetes, pulmonary artery hypertension,
DJD, history of stroke x2, the last one was [**2140**], without any
residual effect, status post cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Vasotec.

MEDICATIONS:  At home, Coumadin, metoprolol, Lasix,
glyburide, Protonix, Lipitor, Macrodantin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, her
temperature was 98 degrees, heart rate was 43, blood pressure
was 117/47, respirations 12, saturating 100%. Her pupils were
2 mm and reactive. She was intubated. She was moving both
upper and lower extremities to pain. The patient had regular
rate and rhythm. The patient's lungs were clear. Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended. The patient was guaiac
negative. Normal tone. There were no step-offs on the
examination of the spine. The patient had C-collar in place.

The patient had a CT of the C-spine and CT of the head that
showed no intracranial hemorrhage. CT of the C-spine showed
the comminuted type 2 dense fracture. CTA of the neck showed
no dissection. MR of the C-spine showed cord contusion at C2
and disruption of anterior ligaments. The patient's white
count was 8.9, hematocrit was 44. BUN was 18, creatinine was
1.3. UA was negative. Toxicology was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the trauma
surgery service and was taken to the intensive care unit. The
patient was started on steroids with a bolus and a drip for
the concern for spinal cord injury. Cardiology was consulted
and recommended continuing supportive medical care. Ortho-
spine was consulted who recommended continuing the collar.
The patient had an elevated coag with 2.4 INR and that was
reversed and the patient was continued on ventilation. On
hospital day #2, the patient was continued on C-collar. The
patient had echocardiogram that showed significant pulmonary
artery hypertension with systolic around 80s with a very poor
right ventricular function. Per cardiology, recommend to
continue supportive care. The patient was kept NPO with a
Foley and the patient was slowly weaned from the ventilation.
On hospital day #3, the patient had acute change in ability
to move the upper extremity. The patient was given vitamin K
and FFP to reverse the coagulopathy for concern for possible
hemorrhage into the C-spinal canal. CT of the C-spine showed
a superior fragment of odontoid fracture, most posteriorly
displaced but not impinging on the cord. MR of the spinal
cord showed no cord compression but continued to have spinal
cord edema. CT of the head showed no acute process. The
patient also had acute respiratory decompensation where the
patient had CTA that initially showed no PE. The patient was
continued to be supported throughout.  On hospital day #4,
the patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs and was
continued to be weaned from the propofol. The patient had
decreased movement of the upper extremity and only moved the
lower extremity with decreasing the vent support. The patient
was placed on Augmentin for Enterococcus urinary tract
infection. Approximately noon on hospital day #4, the patient
developed a significant respiratory and cardiac
decompensation. The patient was hypotensive, also tachycardic
to 150s, and urgent echocardiogram was obtained which showed
that the patient did not have a functioning right ventricle
and also the patient desaturated which were clinically
consistent with pulmonary emboli. At this time with her
injuries and also development of a new pulmonary emboli,
discussion was made with the family who made her DNR. The
patient was continuously supported with pressors and full
vent support and after subsequent discussion, the patient was
then made CMO. After the patient was CMO, the patient expired
at 5:38 p.m. on [**2151-5-31**].
