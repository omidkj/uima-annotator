HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year-old woman with
atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, multiple
myeloma, depression, anxiety, osteoporosis, status post left
hip hemiarthroplasty, left knee surgery in autumn of [**2139**]
with prolonged recovery who presented [**3-18**] to the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of breath
followed by respiratory distress, lead to arrest and rapid
atrial fibrillation.  A Diltiazem drip and lasix were given
to the patient on the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] floor.  Her sickness improved for
a day, but then was followed by respiratory distress that
required intubation and Coronary Care Unit transfer with a
diagnosis of pneumonia with thick green secretions from the
endotracheal tube.  Sepsis ensued with multiple cultures
positive.  Sputum culture on [**3-19**] showed MMSA.  Blood
cultures on [**3-19**] showed MRSA and urine culture on
[**3-18**] showed MRSA.  Of note the blood cultures
surveillance on [**3-22**] and [**3-24**] have shown no
growth to date.

The patient required blood pressure support with no
epinephrine for a brief period of time.  She was covered with
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl until cultures showed
MRSA and MMSA and she was converted then to just Vancomycin.
The patient was assessed by orthopedics to have a left
shoulder anterior dislocation with no intervention indicated.
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction and endoscopy
echocardiogram showed an left ventricular ejection fraction
of 55% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and MR
suggesting that it was the stat sepsis that caused
respiratory distress and hypotension.  surveillance blood
cultures again were negative and hypotension improved and the
patient's son and health care proxy Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname **] a
gerontologist from [**State 4565**] led to the decision to extubate
the patient on [**3-25**] based on the likely need for
prolonged intubation, which the patient would not have
wanted.  The patient was transferred to the general medical
floor for more conservative management and some pain control
and comfort, though she is DNR/DNI and not comfort measures
only.

On examination this morning [**3-26**] she wants coffee, she
has mild throat pain from the endotracheal tube, otherwise
minor shortness of breath and no chest pain.  Physical
