Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2158-10-25**] - Attempted VT ablation

History of Present Illness:
84 yo woman with h/o HTN, dementia, breast cancer s/p
lumpectomy/chemo 20 yrs ago and VT, evaluated at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**7-/2158**]
at which time she did not undergo ablation and instead was
loaded with Amiodarone who then presented to [**Hospital1 **] with
incessant VT and is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In [**Month (only) 216**] a holter monitor showed >[**2146**] runs of VT.  She
initially presented to her PCP with intermittent
[**Name9 (PRE) 94431**], which initiated her work up including holter.
She was subsequently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]. During admission had [**2-3**]
short runs (<30) of Ventricular tachycardia, which were
asymptomatic and with blood pressures at her baseline. She opted
for medical management with amiodarone, amio loaded and
monitored in house. cMRI at that time showed mildly enlarged
left ventricular cavity size with mild global hypokinesis,
mildly depressed LVEF at 55%. The effective forward LVEF was
mildly depressed at 51%. No CMR evidence of prior myocardial
scarring/infarction. Normal RV, Mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] stress
EKG after amiodarone loading which did not induce any VT.
Subsequent holter monitor showed no VT but ocassional
Ventricular Bigeminy.
.
Since this most recent admission, the patient reports feeling
well.  Denies any episodes of chest pain, palpitations,
shortness of breath, trouble breathing, dizziness,
light-headedness, or fainting episodes.  The patient reports
being in her usual state of health, and she went to her PCP
appointment for what she thinks was a normal follow up
appointment (she cannot remember for what).  As per
documentation from OSH, went to PCP for swollen ankles/cough,
then developed CP and EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  At OSH, had
EP study on [**2158-10-23**] and found to have persistent wide complex
tachycardia [**1-4**] autonomic focus.  ECHO on [**2158-10-20**] with EF 40%
(down from 55% in [**7-13**]) and ruled out for MI.

On ROS, denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, trouble
breathing, palpitations, light-headedness, dizziness, syncope.
Pt had difficulty remembering her [**Date Range **], but reports that
nothing has been bothering her since last discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y.o woman with h/o HTN, dementia, breast cancer s/p
lumpectomy/chemo 20 yrs ago and VT evaluated at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**7-/2158**]
at which time she did not undergo ablation and instead was
loaded with Amiodarone who then presented to [**Hospital1 **] with
incessant VT and is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
ACTIVE ISSUE:
.
# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA - Has failed medical management with
amiodarone, which was started on admission in [**Month (only) 216**]. Lidocaine
and Procainamide were used without effect to try to convert her
VT. She then [**Month (only) 1834**] a limited endocardial ablation, however,
this failed to ablate the right ventricular outflow tract focus.
Later she was given Flecainide which converted her rhythm to NSR
but later reconverted to VT, so the dosing was increased. We
maintained her on Flecainide 150 mg PO twice daily, which she
tolerated. We also tried to add a low-dose beta-blocker to this
regimen, but this resulted in some intermittent bradycardia and
hypotension, which resolved with discontinuation of the
beta-blocker. While on this medication, her electrolytes were
closely monitored and her QRS complex was monitored for widening
given the anti-arrhythmic medication. The electrophysiology
service was following her during this admission. QTc at time of
discharge is 0.47 secs.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: cMRI performed [**7-/2158**] with
estimated LVEF 50-55%. Cardiac catheterization was without
obvious stenosis, performed at the outside hospital. She did
have mild crackles appreciated on lung exam (on admission), but
does not have LE pitting edema or JVP elevation. A CXR showed
mild pulmonary edema, and she received only PRN IV Lasix dosing
because she was asymptomatic with SBPs in 100s and does not take
home diuretics. She responded to gentle IV Lasix dosing and
diuresed appr
