Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, abdominal pain.  In the [**Name (NI) **] Pt. was found to be in
A.flutter, cardioverted, became hypotensive/SOB. Transferred to
the CCU for further monitoring and eval for further treatment of
A.flutter.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
temporary pacer
intubation
central venous line
arterial line

History of Present Illness:
85 yo M w/ hx. of hyperlipidemia and HTN presented to his PCP
with [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/o abd pain and DOE and SOB x 2-3 days. Found to
tachycardic (140's) with RA 02 sats were 93%.  Pt. reports
flu-like symptoms 2-3 weeks prior, but has otherwise been
healthy. He does not report any change in his excercise
tolerance. He can walk up to a quarter mile which has not
changed. He does report intermittent DOE over the past several
years. He also noticed his abdomen has distended and
uncomfortable since Sunday.
ROS: denies HA, chest pain, N/V. He reports constipation (small
BM this AM) and diffuse abdominal pain since Sunday. All other
ROS as above.
.
In the ED: initial VS 98.8 HR 140 BP 162/88 RR 18 02 92% RA to
96% on 4L NC
Presented with a rapid rate. Given adenosine 6mg x2, flutter
waves noted on EKG, given Dilt 20 x ?2, lopressor 10 iv, esmolol
60mg. ASA 81mg, lasix, NTG SL, NTG ointment, he was cardioverted
(DCC synchronized 50J w/fentanyl 50mcg&propofol 30mcg) with
conversion to NSR following a long pause. However, following
cardioversion he became bradycardic to the 50's and hypotensive
80/50 given 1L NS and placed on a NRB and given 1 amp of calcium
gluconate. He became hypotensive and SOB, a CXR showed failure
and he was given 120 IV lasix. In the ED his intial ABG was
7.39/23/103 with a lactate of 4.3. of He was started on a
heparin GTT and transferred to the CCU.
.
In the CCU he progressively became SOB and complained of
worsening abdominal pain, diaphoretic, appeared to go into
respiratory arrest then went into asystolic arrest, CPR was
initiated. He was given Epi x3, bicarb x2, atropine x2,  he was
intubated and resuscitated after approximately 7 min of CPR.
When his pulse returned, his rhythm with a.fib/RVR of 140 with
SBP of 200's. He was given 5 IV lopressor and a temporary pacing
wire was placed by cardiology.

.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Denies exertional
buttock or calf pain.  All of the other review of systems were
negative.

He did report dyspnea on exertion as discussed above.

pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.

BS. could not assess HSM. Abd aorta not enlarged by palpation.

Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+  Femoral 2+  Popliteal 2+  DP 2+   PT 2+
Left:  Carotid 2+  Femoral 2+  Popliteal 2+  DP 2+   PT 2+


Pertinent Results:
CXR: (portable [**4-23**]) IMPRESSION: Interstitial edema with small
bilateral pleural effusions consistent with CHF/volume overload.
 More dense opacity  within the right infrahilar region likely
represents alveolar edema; however, consolidation cannot be
excluded
and repeat radiographs are recommended.

LABORATORY DATA:
CK  153
Troponin 0.07
CK-MB 9
Anion GAP 15
CBC with 2 bands
Bicarb 20, crt. 1.6
Initial ABG 7.39/23/103
.
Abdominal/Pelvic CT:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left and
compression atelectasis.
2. Left exophytic heterogeneous renal cyst concerning for renal
cell carcinoma. MRI is recommended for further characterization.
Right intracortical hypodensity not fully characterized, could
also be evaluated with MRI.
4. Foley catheter with its balloon inflated in the prostatic
urethra. Repositioning is recommended.
5. Bilateral minimally displaced acute rib fractures.
6. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
7. L3 lytic lesion just inferior to the superior endplate, could
be degenerative in nature, however, cannot rule out metastatic
disease.
8. Atherosclerotic changes.
.
TTE [**2121-4-24**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30
percent) with some regional
variation (apex appears somewhat more hypocontractile than base,
and posterior wall appears somewhat more hypocontractile than
the rest of the ventricle).  Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse.  Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
MRI abdomen/pelvis [**2121-4-28**]:
1. Bilateral simple renal cyst. Exophytic left renal lesion seen
on CT scan of [**2121-4-24**] corresponds to a simple renal cyst.

2. Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis/consolidation.

3. Aortoiliac atherosclerosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course: this patient is a 85M with a history of HTN and
hyperlipidemia who presents with SOB and abd pain x 3 days,
found to be in new onset A.flutter. In the ED s/p cardioversion
(50 J), pt. became hypotensive and hypoxic with a lactic
acidiosis. Soon after transfer to the CCU, he had a asystolic
arrest, he was resucitated and intubated he was extubated on
[**4-26**]. Incidentally, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a left renal
mass c/w RCC.
.
1. Respiratory/cardiac arrest: It was unclear why this occured,
possible secondary to respiratory failure and lactic acidosis.
Initially there was suspicion of sepsis due to an elevated WBC
and complaints of abdominal pain.  However, abdominal workup did
not reveal a source of infection and cultures have remained
negative. The patient was in asystolic arrest for approximately
9 minutes. ACLS was initiated immediately, spontaneous rhythm
was re-established after epinephrine/atropine/bicarb were
administered. HE was intubated and a temporary pacing wire
placed. A follow up head CT did not show any evidence of
ischemic injury. The patient pulled out his temporary pacer. He
was extubated and his respiratory status was stable throughout
his stay.
.
2. Metabolic acidosis: the patient initial ABG 7.39/24/103 with
a lactic acid of 4.3. The etiology of his lactic acidosis is
unclear although it could be secondary to hypoperfusion, as the
patinet was hypotensive in the ED. Other possibilities
entertained were ischemic bowel, given the patients complaints
of abdominal pain also sepsis as discussed abov
