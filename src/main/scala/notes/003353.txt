History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old man with history notable for extensive
pulmonary asbestosis, atrial fibrillation, and RP fibrosis s/p
ureterolysis and omental wrap who presented to an outside
hospital on [**2196-10-26**] for elective hernia repair.   The patient
has long been awaiting repair of a large inguinal hernia and
ventral hernia and had stopped taking his coumadin 10 days prior
to presentation (he is on this for atrial fibrillation) in order
to get these procedures completed.  Over the week prior to
presentation he had also noted worsening left lower extremity
edema and increasing abdominal girth with worsening of his
preexisting vental hernia.   Other review of systems notable for
some nonproductive cough as well as general fatigue and
decreased mobility for the past month, which he largely
attributed to his impressive hydrocele.  He denied any
fevers,chest pain, orthopnea, or PND.

At the outside hospital initial evaluation revealed abdominal
wall erythema concerning for cellulitis as well as a swollen
left lower extremity.   Ultrasound showed left common femoral
vein DVT.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

On arrival he complained of fatigue and discomfort from his
large hernias.  No other issues.

Past Medical History:
-asbestosis
-atrial fibrillation
-ureterolysis
-RP fibrosis (presumed idiopathic)
-omental wrap


Social History:
The patient worked as a steam engineer for over 40 years.  He
reports significant asbestos exposure over a period of several
years.  He lives with his wife of 58 years.  He denies TOB or
drug use and says he drinks alcohol only very occasionally.


Family History:
Father died of complications of pernicious anemia, mother died
at age 66 of ??????heart problems??????.  [**Name2 (NI) **] brother died of an MI at
age 53, both younger brothers died of CVD in their 40??????s.  One

died at age 68 of cerebral hemorrhage.  His one remaining
sibling, a sister, is 77 and well.

PATHOLOGY
===========
Pleural Fluid Cytology from [**11-10**], [**11-13**], and [**11-15**]: Negative for
Malignant Cells
Peritoneal Fluid Cytology from [**11-5**] and [**11-13**]: Negative for

Pleural Fluid Immunophenotyping:
NTERPRETATION
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma are not
seen in specimen. Correlation with clinical findings and
morphology (see C09-[**Numeric Identifier **]) is recommended. Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECG [**2196-10-26**]:
Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise, tracing is within normal limits

CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/O Contrast [**2196-10-26**]:
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
1. Abnormal soft tissue encasing the retroperitoneal structures,
surrounding the aorta and IVC, extending inferiorly along the
presacral space. These findings are incompletely characterized
without intravenous contrast.  Findings could reflect
retroperitoneal fibrosis, though correlation with prior history
or any prior imaging would be helpful. The attenuation of this
material is not compatible with hemorrhage
2. Complex ventral abdominal wall hernia containing fat, fluid
and small
bowel, without evidence of obstruction.
3. Large left inguinal hernia, with herniation of fluid and
sigmoid colon to the left scrotal sac.
4. Large amount of ascites.
5. Left external iliac, common femoral, and superficial femoral
venous
thrombosis.

Chest Radiograph [**2196-11-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Marked cardiac enlargement predominantly involving
the left heart. Extensive bilateral pleural changes including
calcifications consistent with previous asbestos exposure.
Pulmonary vasculature demonstrates upper zone re-distribution
pattern but no conclusive evidence for acute infiltrates.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2196-11-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusive deep venous thrombosis in the common femoral vein
extending into the greater saphenous and deep femoral veins. Of
note, the proximal extent of thrombus is not defined.
2. No right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.

Spirometry [**2196-11-4**]:
