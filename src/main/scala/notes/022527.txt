History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8789**] is an 84 year old male with severe AS, Afib on
coumadin, HTN, HL who presents with abdominal pain. Had been
admitted to ICU with cholangitis and e. coli bacteremia in [**11-17**]
status post percutaneous cholecystostomy, that course was
complicated by thrombocytopenia and leukopenia attributed to
metronidazole.  He was readmitted with abdominal pain and mildly
elevated LFTs in [**1-18**], no evidence recurret cholecystitis or
cholangitis on imaging, thought to be due to passed stone.

He presented this morning to the ED with complaints of fatigue
and abdominal pain x 1 day. He had a fever in ED to 101.9,
though defervesed quickly. His SBP initially was 120 (normally
100-120s on antihypertensives), then decreased to 80s, after
which he received 2-3L IVF with response to SBP high 90s.  While
hypotensive wife concerned may have been confused, however was
answering questions appropriately. Reportedly improved after
IVF. Labs notable for a normal lactate, normal cardiac enzymes,
no ECG changes. Cr increasd to 1.3 from 1.1. No leukocytosis.
Normal LFTs Blood culture sent.  UA unremarkable other than
known hematuria for which he sees urology.  Abd CT without acute
process, only known pneumobilia. CXR with no acute process.
Covered broadly with levaquin/flagyl for suspected GI source.
With BP drop and confusion there was a question of meningitis,
no meningismus on exam, but was covered with vancomycin and
bactrim IV for listeria and gram negative coverage, no
cephalosporin . INR to high for LP as was 2.8. There was also
concern for flu in the ED, swab was not able to be done prior to
transfer, but was transfered on droplet precautions.  VS at time
of transfer: Afebrile, 97/47 16 99% 2L, he had 2PIVs placed.

On arrival to [**Name (NI) 153**] pt is resting comfortably, reports abdominal
pain resolved, which he attributes to aggressive IVF.  He
reports driving home from a hearing this morning, noted acute
lower abdominal pain with fatigue and shaking chills.  He denies
changes in his bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation,
hematochezia, melena. Occasional GERD.  No nausea or vomiting.
No recent medication changes, antibiotics or new/unusual foods.
Recent travel to CA where he visited granddaughter and her
partner, both of whom had some type or URI.  He denies headache.
Does have mild coryza which he attributes to allergies. No sore
throat, cough, shortness of breath. No chest pressure or pain.
No dysuria. No rashes or joint pain. No dizziness,
lightheadedness or syncope. No orthopnea or DOE.  No LE edema.

Pt came to the ED because he felt these symptoms were similar in
nature to his last episode of cholecystitis/cholangitis.
