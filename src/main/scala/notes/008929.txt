Service:  CT Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old
male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus,
who presented to his primary care physician saying that he
had been having substernal chest pain on exertion.  This pain
was alleviated with rest and lasted only a couple of minutes
at a time.

The patient was referred for a stress echocardiogram which
was significant for global ST depressions of 4.5 mm after a
4.5 minute exercise test on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol.  The patient
was asymptomatic.  His left ventricular ejection fraction at
that time was 45% to 50%.  The ST depressions lasted for 17
minutes and resolved.  There was also hypokinesis of the
distal half of the septum and anterior wall, distal third of
the lateral and inferior wall and apex.  The patient
presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further
workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes mellitus.  2.
Hypertension.  3.  Hyperlipidemia.  4.  Erectile dysfunction.
5.  Dermatitis.  6.  Asymptomatic hearing loss.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.,
multivitamins one p.o.q.d., atenolol 50 mg p.o.q.d.,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.q.d., glyburide 5 mg p.o.q.d.,
lisinopril 40 mg p.o.q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and works as a cook
at [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Club.  He quit tobacco one year ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a brother who died of a
myocardial infarction at age 37.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was a thin appearing gentleman in no acute distress with a
temperature of 96.5, heart rate 82, blood pressure 141/62,
respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 98% in room air.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic
ejection murmur at left lower sternal border.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  Warm without peripheral edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission sodium was 137, potassium 3.7,
chloride 95, bicarbonate 29, BUN 11, creatinine 0.9, white
blood cell count 8.5, hematocrit 38.8, platelet count 305,000
and INR 1.2.  Preoperative electrocardiogram showed sinus
rhythm at a rate of 66 beats per minute with no acute
ischemic changes.  Echocardiogram on [**2160-9-2**] was as
described above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the cardiology
service and underwent cardiac catheterization.  This was
significant for left main coronary artery 80% mid and 90%
distal stenosis, left anterior descending artery with mild
disease, ramus with 85% stenosis, left circumflex with 90%
stenosis and right coronary artery with 70% stenosis.  There
was mild global hypokinesis.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was evaluated by the cardiothoracic
surgery team.

The patient was taken directly to the Operating Room, where
he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times five.  The
grafts were left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery, saphenous vein graft to distal right
coronary artery, posterior descending coronary artery
sequential and left radial to obtuse marginal and diagonal
one sequential.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition on minimal pressor support and intubated.

Postoperatively, the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm
and was weaned off pressor support.  He was placed on NTGs
for the radiograph and was reversed from anesthetics.  The
patient was weaned to extubation without incident.  The
patient remained stable in his postoperative course,
requiring minimal support.

On postoperative day number two, the patient's chest tubes
were removed and the patient was out of bed to a chair.  He
was started on Lasix, to which he responded appropriately.
The patient continued to remain in sinus rhythm.  He had an
episode of sinus tachycardia with shortness of breath.  An
echocardiogram was performed, which ruled out a wall motion
abnormality.  The patient had a left ventricular ejection
fraction of greater than 55%.  There was trace aortic
regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

The patient was diuresed more aggressively and his symptoms
resolved.  The patient was transferred to the floor on
posterior day number four and, on posterior day number five,
the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.  The
patient was started on amiodarone and increased in beta
blockade.  The patient converted to sinus rhythm and remained
in normal sinus rhythm for greater than 48 hours.

The patient's wires were discontinued on postoperative day
number seven.  At that time, the patient again developed
shortness of breath and he was found to be hypertensive with
a systolic blood pressure in the 190s, and he had decreased
breath sounds in the left lung field.  The patient was
diuresed with intravenous Lasix and was given intravenous
hydralazine for afterload reduction and fluid removal.  The
patient's symptomatology resolved.  The patient has remained
stable.  His Lasix dose has been increased.  The patient has
been stable for greater than 24 hours and is ready for
discharge home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in four weeks and will follow up with his primary care
physician in two weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery bypass grafting status post coronary
artery bypass grafting times five.
2.  Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hyperlipidemia.
6.  Erectile dysfunction.
7.  Dermatitis.
8.  Asymptomatic hearing loss.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d. times two weeks.
Potassium chloride 40 mEq p.o.b.i.d. times two weeks.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.q.d.
Lopressor 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Glyburide 5 mg p.o.q.d.
Imdur 60 mg p.o.q.d. times three months.
