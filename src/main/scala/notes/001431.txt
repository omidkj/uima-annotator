Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
bleeding per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.Colonoscopy
2.Right femoral line placement/removal


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4223**] is a pleasant 79 year-old female with severe PVD
(s/p right BKA in [**2-/2104**] and [**6-/2104**] left great toe amputation),
hemorrhoids, complicated diabetes mellitus, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
diabetic related nephropathy and neuropathy and pulmonary emboli
diagnosed in [**4-/2104**] ([**Hospital1 2025**]) who had been on combination of
ASA/Plavix/Coumadin when she presented on this admission
complaining of bright red blood per rectum for 1.5 weeks before
transfer for evaluation.

On arrival to ED, outside facility reported that patient's last
INR was 7.1 a week before and Coumadin was held temporarily. Per
the patient, she had bright red blood with bowel movements for a
little over a week that the nursing home staff were monitoring.
She notes her BM's have most recently been diarrhea which she
attributes to stool softeners at the NH and reportedly just
finished a course of Flagyl in recent weeks for suspected
C.Difficile. She had 5-10 episodes of BRBPR the past week that
were painless, definitely bright red without melena, mixed in
with the stool (not necessarily streaked), and there was blood
on the toilet paper as well. No episodes of dizziness, chest
pains, dyspnea, presyncope, weakness, blood loss anywhere else.
Of note, had a negative screening colonoscopy in [**2101**] here at
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
On [**2104-8-5**] she was brought into the ED, initial VS: [**Age over 90 **]F, HR 72
BP 118/49, RR  16 and 100%RA. Labs significant for Hct 25.3, INR
2.7, and normal Plts. GI was consulted in the ED. K was also 6.2
so she was given Ca gluconate, insulin/D50. She had BRB on
rectal exam and NG lavage was negative. Access was an issue and
she was unable to get secure peripherals, so after failed
bilateral central line (IJ) attempts, she got a triple lumen in
her right femoral region, then got 1L NS IVFs, 1u PRBC's, 2u
FFP, and Vitamin K.
.
ROS was negative for any associated abdominal pains, nausea,
emesis, vision changes, HEENT problems, headaches, poor PO
intake, dysphagia, odynophagia, SOB, cough, palpitations,
dysuria or problems with urination, skin changes.

Vitals before transfer to the ICU were HR 75, BP 148/60, RR 20
and O2 sat 100%RA. She has very stable blood pressures despite
GIB and her HCT was also stable in the 24-25 ranges in the ICU
so she was sent to the general medical floor on [**8-6**] where was
followed until time of discharge with a fairly unremarkable
course. The GI consult service followed patient closely and she
had colonoscopy performed on [**8-7**] with notable AVMs in lower GI
tract/sigmoid area that were treated with argon coagulation.

for 22 years. From [**State 5170**] and has limited family in the area.

and has been living in rehabilitation facilities/nursing homes
for the past 6 months after R BKA and toe amputation, most
recently at [**Hospital1 **] Lights. Distant history of tobacco use for 4
yrs, quit 20yrs ago, rare alcohol use. No IVDU.

[**8-6**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Low precordial lead voltage. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2104-6-27**] there is variation in precordial
lead placement which may relate to misattached leads. No
apparent diagnostic interim change.

[**8-7**] Colonscopy Report:

Findings:
 Contents: Poor prep was noted throughout the whole colon,
however there were no obvious massess visualized. Significant
amount of stool was found in the right colon limiting the view.

 Mucosa: Abnormal vascularity typical of AVMs with spontaneous
bleeding. There were associated pale/white mucosal plaques also
noted in the rectum, and distal sigmoid colon. They were not
able to be washed off.  Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology.
Other
procedures: An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for
hemostasis successfully in the rectum and distal sigmoid colon.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology of the white
musosal lesions at the distal sigmoid colon.

Impression: Abnormal vascularity in the rectum, and distal
sigmoid colon (biopsy)
Stool in the whole colon
(thermal therapy, biopsy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old female with h/o PVD s/p R BKA in [**2-/2104**] and [**6-/2104**] L
toe amp; HTN/HL/DM with nephropathy and neuropathy; PE in [**4-/2104**]
and currently on ASA/Plavix/Coumadin, and h/o hemorrhoid surgery
who presents with blood per rectum x1 week.

1. GIB: Given history of bright red blood and negative NG
lavage, mostly suspected lower GIB. Given h/o hemorrhoidal
surgery and Hct being fairly within her baseline, this seems
high the differential. However, other common causes of LGIB were
considered such as diverticular bleed and AVM's. Given normal
colonoscopy in [**2101**], lower suspicion for malignancy. Lack of
pain, fevers, WBC count makes infectious vs ischemic colitis
less likely. She had very stable HCTs in the 24-25 range and
only required one unit of blood on entire admission as no
excessive bleeding noted. She never had any concerning
hypotension or tachycardia which was also reassuring. GI scoped
the patient on hospital day 3 after preparation with Moviprep
overnight. Reports revealed abnormal vascularity typical of AVMs
with spontaneous bleeding. There were associated pale/white
mucosal plaques also noted in the rectum, and distal sigmoid
colon. Biopsies were performed for histology. Biopsies are
pending now. An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for
hemostasis successfully in the rectum and distal sigmoid colon.
Bleeding was blamed on LGI AVMs that were noted.
 She had all of her anti-HTN medications held and her aspirin,
plavix and coumadin all held for 3 days. Team opted to hold her
usual home Plavix at time of discharge and she will discuss
restart with her new PCP and her vascular sur
