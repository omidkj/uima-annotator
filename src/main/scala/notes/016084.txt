History of Present Illness:
An 82 year old [**First Name3 (LF) 595**] speaking woman recently discharged from
[**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for PNA returns with 3 days of diarrhea complicated
by tachycardia and fever as measured by her daughter/VNA. This
history is obtained from the patient's daughter and review of
medical records as communication with the patient is difficult
secondary to language and hearing difficulties.
.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF RECENT HOSPITALIZATION [**Date range (1) 108333**]:
The patient presented with hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory
failure due to PNA with effusions attributed to diastolic heart
failure. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and started on
Levoflox/Vanc to finish a 10 day Levofloxacin only course. The
patient experienced ? AMS but head CT was negative. Patient was
continued on Lovenox for chronic DVT h/o PE. Her cr remained at
1.8-2.4 during this admission. She developed a new wound
possibly from plexipulses and required extensive wound care for
multiple wounds. She was made DNR/DNI. The patient was D/C'd
home without mention of diarrhea.
.
Per the daughter, [**Name (NI) 108329**], the patient developed diarrhea during
her recent hospitalization that has persisted since discharge.
The patient had a "tought day" with some agitation and apparent
discomfort with breathing. The patient was eating but
"everything she ate caused loose stools" different from her
regular Crohn's flares. When [**Name (NI) 108329**] noted tachycardia and fever
accompanying the loose, yellow non-bloody stools with an
increasing O2 requirement, the patient was brought into the ED
.
In the ED, VS: 99.2 BP 103/53 HR 110, RR 24, 100% on 3L. Exam
revealed crackles and decreased BS. EKG showing RBBB with old
TWI in 3, sinus tach. CXR: resolving PNA. Received Vanco 1g &
fluids in ED.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is laying in bed and
reports that she is "fine." She complains of generalized chronic
weakness and has pain during wound dressing changes. Her
daughter relayed the history as above. The patient has a cough
productive of green sputum once on arrival. She has R sided
tremor.
.
ROS:
Significant for easy bruising, long standing vision & hearing
loss,
Denies headache, cough (except for above), SOB, chest pain,
abdominal pain, hematochezia, melena

IMAGING:
[**2194-4-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. New mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion.

2. Persistent moderate left pleural effusion and dense
retrocardiac opacity
which may represent left lower lobe collapse or, less likely,
consolidation.

2. Left thyroid cyst.


Brief Hospital Course:
An 82 year old lady with multiple medical problems recently
discharged for PNA presents with 3 days of diarrhea accompanied
by tachycardia & fever with concern for new left pneumonia
despite levaquin therapy. Her exam and appearance is concerning
for respiratory distress.
.
1) Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a new left sided
pneumonia, retrocardiac opacity and L pleural effusion on CXR
from either new process or aspiration. On admission to the
medicine service she was found to be in hypoxic/hypercarbic
respiratory failure and was transferred to the ICU. She was
started on vancomycin/zosyn 2 week course, albuterol and
ipratropium neb treatments and supplemental oxygen. IV fluids
were administered for her acute on chronic CKD (see below) which
may have lead to some pulmonary edema. Sputum culture was done
but did not reveal the source of her pneumonia. She completed
the course and her oxygen requirements improved. Lasix was held
in the setting of her ATN thus some fluid overload may be
present, and prior to discharge she was slowly restarted on
lasix for diuresis. She remained afebrile for the length of her
admission. Prior to discharge a repeat chest xray showed a
