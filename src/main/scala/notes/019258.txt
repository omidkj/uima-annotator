Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
60F with multiple medical problems including DM2, chronic LBP on
morphine PCA, lower extrem myelopathy, seizure d/o, chronic UTI,
metastatic thyroid CA, s/p recent cholecystectomy h/o line
infections initially admitted [**5-15**] with decreased mental status,
lethargy, and confusion.


[**Name (NI) 1094**] husband states that she had been doing very well at home
until the day of admission, when she awoke from a nap with
confusion (baseline mental status is fully responsive and
communicative).


On the night PTA, the pt's SBP was noted to be 90 (her normal
SBP is ~150). She was awake all night with severe leg pain. On
[**5-15**], pt gave herself two boluses of IV morphine 10 mg. She took
a nap and when she awoke this afternoon she acted very confused
to her husband. [**Name (NI) **] advice fr her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] husband turned off
her morphine pump at 3 pm. She did not improve so he brought her
in. No alcohol intake x yrs. Only med change over the past
several months is addition of [**Name10 (NameIs) 23792**] 3 days ago. Husband did
not notice any empty med bottles or misuse of meds.


Of note, pt had been seen in clinic 3 days prior to this and
started on IV vancomycin (administered @ home) for a presumed
Portacath line infection (?erythematous overlying skin?).


ROS+ for severe diffuse HA x 24 hrs, which did not respond to
acetamin. Husband also reports +photophobia, with the pt asking
her husband to turn off the lights. She also had 2 episodes of
non-bloody, bilious emesis. Otherwise, on ROS, denies dysuria,
diarrhea (has chronic constipation), chest pain, cough, or URI
sxs. Poor PO intake over the past 1 day or so.


In ED, fingerstick 123. Head CT without bleed, wbc, LFTs all wnl
with EKG unchanged and neg CXR. In ED, given Anzemet,
hydralazine, narcan 0.2 mg IV, mrophine 2mg IV, and 1gm
Vancomycin. SBP remained elevated in ED ranging 157-214 with
diastolics 80s-90s. Given 500 CC NS IV x 1. Pt did not have LP
since she has been a difficult LP in the past secondary to
spinal stenosis and pt's husband requested to be done by
neurology or fluoroscopy. Given concern for meningitis or
meningoencephalitis, pt was initially admitted to floor by NF
overnight with empiric treatment with Ceftriaxone (only 1 gm by
POE) and Vancomycin. When team saw this am, pt was diaphoretic
and responsive to voice but otherwise not following commands.
Ceftriaxone was changed to meningitis dose 2 gm q12, and
acyclovir to cover HSV encephalitis, and neuro consulted for LP.
MICU consulted initially for concern of mental status and
concern for sepsis, but at that time was afebrile. Through the
course of the day, pt spiked temp to 104, HR 130s, SBP
persistently elevated above 200s not responding to IV
hydralazine and lopressor. Required IV labetalol at bedside with
MD monitoring at bedside. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (no west MICU
beds) for Bblocker drip for HTN and for further w/u &
monitoring.

.
-Blood Cx x2: NGTD
-Urine Cx x2: NGTD
-UA: unremarkable
-LP [**5-18**]: NO PMNs, no organisms
-EKG (in ED): NSR@73, poor baseline, normal intervals/axis, no
ST/T wave changes, unchanged from prior
-CXR (in ED): No acute cardiopulmonary disease
-Head CT (in ED): No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
-Echo [**2191-5-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
