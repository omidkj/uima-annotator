CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shoulder pain, failure to thrive, mental
status change.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for
intermittent atrial fibrillation and benign prostatic
hypertrophy, who was evaluated at an outside hospital for
right shoulder pain, unclear of the work-up done at the
outside hospital as there was no documentation.

History was obtained from the daughter.  The patient was seen
at an outside hospital and was discharged.  The patient
continued to have shoulder pain, change in mental status and
was sent here to [**Hospital1 69**].  In
the Emergency Department, the patient had denied chest pain
and shortness of breath.  He was admitted to the coronary
Intensive Care Unit for asymptomatic bradycardia. He was seen
by the electrophysiology service who did not see need for
pacemaker or asymptomatic Winkebach.

Chest x-ray revealed a retrocardiac opacity, questionable
pneumonia and 4 out of 4 blood cultures were positive for
gram negative rods which were identified as pan sensitive
Klebsiella. The patient has reported allergies to multiple
antibiotics including cephalosporins which cause anaphylaxis,
Quinolones which cause rash and unclear childhood Penicillin
allergy and unclear allergy to macrolides.  Repeat chest
x-ray showed improvement of retrocardiac opacity. The patient
was transferred from the CCU to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for decreased urine output which had resolved over one
day and was transferred to the floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for benign prostatic
hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, history of gastrointestinal
bleed in [**2105**].  Status post skin cancer, in remission,
unclear when.  Skin cancer was diagnosed. Unclear of
treatment.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
The patient was on Aztreonam 250 mg q. six hours which was
started on [**12-13**], Finasteride 5 mg q. day, Pantoprazole 40 mg
q. day, Colace 100 mg twice a day, Tylenol prn and heparin
subcutaneous.

As previously stated, allergies are as follows:
Cephalosporin causing anaphylaxis, Quinolone causing rash,
Penicillin unclear childhood allergy, Macrolides, unclear
reaction.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
Prilosec.
Finasteride.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in [**Hospital3 **] with private
caretaker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on transfer to the floor
revealed 97.0; blood pressure 144/86; pulse of 51; saturating
97% on room air.  He is lethargic, elderly gentleman,
appearing younger than his stated age, in no apparent
distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  He has a right
surgical pupil.  Left pupil was 2 mm which was minimally
reactive.  His oropharynx is dry.  Neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy. No jugular venous distention.  Chest:  He
had bronchial breath sounds bilaterally throughout. Cardiac
examination:  Bradycardiac and irregular with a normal S1 and
S2, no murmurs.  Abdomen:  Quiet bowel sounds, some slight
tenderness on deep palpation but otherwise soft. No
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities: Left heel eschar, 2 by 2 cm
without erythema or proximal streaking.  The patient also has
a left thigh pressure sore which does not appear to be
infected.  Neurologically, he is alert and oriented times
one.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 21.1 with a left shift; 91
neutrophils, 5 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes.  Hematocrit of 33.0.
Platelets of 143.  PTT of 25.3; INR of 1.1.  Sodium of 142;
potassium of 4.0; chloride of 114; bicarbonate of 20; BUN 35;
creatinine 1.3; glucose 171.  ALT of 15; AST of 24; LDH of
148.  Alkaline phosphatase of 154.  Total bilirubin of 1.5.
Albumin 2.7.  Calcium 8.1. Magnesium of 2.1. Phosphorus of
3.2.  TSH of .68.  He did have a calculated [**Doctor First Name **] of .1%.
Urinalysis showed large blood, negative leukoesterase, 20 to
50 red cells, 0 to 2 white cells, no bacteria.  Again, he had
blood cultures, four bottles, positive for pansensitive
Klebsiella.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On transfer to the floor, the patient was
continued on Aztreonam until intravenous access was lost.
Intravenous team could not place another peripheral line. The
patient's daughter refused central venous access. The patient
was started on oral Levofloxacin and continued to do well.
Klebsiella was sensitive to Quinolones, although the patient
has a stated rash to Quinolones. There was no sign of rash or
reaction to the medicine during the course of his hospital
stay.  His fluoroquinolone should be continued through
[**2112-12-25**] and discontinued after that.  This will give him a
total two week course of antibiotics.  Most likely source of
his Klebsiella is a pulmonary source. The patient could not
tolerate CT of the abdomen. Right upper quadrant and total
abdominal ultrasound was negative.

Mental status:  The patient was originally admitted for
change in mental status. He responded well initially to
intravenous fluids and then with improvement of his
infection. His third issue is his acute renal failure.  The
patient did have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of less than 1% and slightly elevated
creatinine above his baseline.  This also responded with
intravenous hydration.

Fourth issue is his asymptomatic bradycardia. He has Mobitz
type I or Wenckebach heart block. He was evaluated by the
electrophysiology service. No pacer will be placed.  He did
have transthoracic echo done which showed an ejection
fraction of 40 to 45%.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Speech and swallow did
see the patient at the bedside and assessed adequate
function. He was encouraged to take increased p.o.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Rehabilitation facility.

Finasteride 5 mg p.o. q. day.
Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. day.
Tylenol prn.

The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10145**], his primary
