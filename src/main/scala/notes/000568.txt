labs on discharge:
[**2180-11-8**]: Na: 142 K: 4.8 Cl: 113 CO2: 18 BUN: 53 Cr: 2.4 glu: 78
Ca: 8.8 Mg: 2.2 P: 5.0

.
CT Head without contrast [**2180-11-4**]: IMPRESSION: No acute
intracranial pathology. Please note that MRI is more sensitive
for the detection of early CVA. If clinically indicated, MRI
with diffusion images could be performed.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2180-10-25**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Large left retroperitoneal hematoma involving the iliopsoas
extends down into the left groin.
2. Unchanged nodular enlargement of the left adrenal gland is
incompletely characterized on this non-contrast CT.
3. Interstitial thickening of the dependent lung bases suggest
volume overload.
.
Portable Abdomen [**2180-10-24**]:IMPRESSION: Right-sided 7 mm renal
stone located overlying the right transverse process of the L4
vertebral body corresponding closely to the right renal stone
identified in the [**2180-6-30**] CT.
.
MRI Brain/Head/Neck [**2180-10-14**]:
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:
There are several areas of slow diffusion identified in both
cerebral hemispheres. In the right cerebral hemisphere,
prominent approximately 1-cm area of slow diffusion seen in the
right basal ganglia periventricular region. In addition, several
small subcortical areas of hyperintensity seen, one in the right
periatrial region and the second in right parietal subcortical
region. In addition, small areas of slow diffusion are seen in
the left basal ganglia periventricular region and left parietal
subcortical region. Findings are indicative of multiple acute
infarct, probably from embolic source. There is no midline
shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus. Moderate brain atrophy and
mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease are identified.
The suprasellar and craniocervical regions are normal.
.
IMPRESSION: Multiple small acute infarcts in the subcortical
region as described above. Moderate brain atrophy and mild
changes of small vessel disease.
.
MRA OF THE NECK:
Neck MRA somewhat limited by motion demonstrates mild
atherosclerotic disease at both internal carotid origin. No
evidence of high-grade stenosis seen in the internal carotid
carotids. Stenosis is also seen at the origin of the right
external carotid. Both vertebral arteries demonstrate
tortuosity, which could be secondary to cervical spondylosis.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild atherosclerotic at the origin of both internal
carotid arteries. The evaluation is somewhat limited by motion.
.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation. Both middle cerebral artery
bifurcation regions are not visualized on projection images. In
addition, both posterior cerebral arteries are not well
visualized on projection images. However, these vessels are well
visualized on the source images.
IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRA of the head.
.
Bilateral Duplex LE [**2180-10-14**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT
involving the right or left lower extremities.
.
CT Head [**2180-10-13**]: IMPRESSION: Evidemce of sinusitis invloving
bilateral sphenoid, left ethmoid sinuses. Opacification of right
mastoid air cells. No acute intracranial pathology, hemorrhage
or masses.
.
ECHO [**2180-10-9**]: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-1-21**],
the ejection fraction now appears normal. Moderate symmetric
LVH, severe AS and moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension are similar to prior.
.
CT without contrast [**2180-10-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe upper lobe predominant interstitial and ground-glass
opacities, with a small simple right pleural effusion and
scattered pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Differential considerations include hemorrhage, interstitial
pneumonia (either infectious or acute, idiopathic) and
noncardiac edema.
2. Probable calcific aortic stenosis. Sever
