History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a formerly healthy 73 F with a PMHx of dormant SLE
who presented to [**Hospital6 2561**] [**2156-8-30**] with few days'
history of fatigue, profound sleepiness, slurred speech and
fever. She lives in [**Hospital1 6687**], and gives a history of working
outside at home in the yard and being too busy to check herself
for ticks about a week ago, although she is uncertain of the
time. On [**8-30**] she was driving through [**State 350**] to a wedding
in upstate [**State 531**] when a concerned motorist who had been
following her felt that she had been driving erratically and
called police. She was then adviced to take a taxi to her
friend's house. She was noted to have slurred speech and "not
herself".
She was then brought to [**Hospital3 **] and was found to have
temperature of 102.6. Initial lab show WBC 6.8 Hct 29.1,
pletelet 76, nml PT and PTT. Patient received ASA and CTX in the
ED. She was intially thought to have lupus flare, and remained
intermittently somnolent and confused. ESR 83 and CRP350. Blood
smear on [**2156-8-31**] show >50% babesia. Patient received 2 doses of
azithromycin and was then started on clindamycin and quinine on
[**2156-9-1**]. Head CT showed subcortical disease bifrontally and MRI
head was negative.
She had a spurious Hct drop from 29.1 to 15.1, now 28.9 post 2u
PRBC transfusion. Platelets dropped from 76 to 40s with normal
coags and Cr 1.3 improving to 0.8. She was also found to have
rising LFTs and high LDH. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**9-1**]
in anticipation of possible exchange transfusion given her
parasite burden.
.
ROS: denies sick contacts. Otherwise, she denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting,
urinary complaints, heache, dizziness. She does have diarrhea
but claims that it is chronic.

EKG: NSR nl axis no ST/TW changes
.
CXR [**9-1**]:  Mediastinal widening is new in the interval and
may be due to lymphadenopathy.  Low lung volumes are present.
Heart is normal size.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Lungs
are clear
.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum,
hila, or axilla. There are small bilateral pleural effusions
with associated dependent atelectasis. There are no focal
nodular opacities or areas of consolidation. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax.
Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate no obvious
abnormalities within the upper abdominal organs.
CTA CHEST: There is no evidence of filling defects within the
pulmonary arterial vasculature. No evidence of pulmonary
embolism. No evidence of aortic dissection or aneurysmal
dilatation. There are a few calcifications seen within the
aortic arch and descending aorta.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or
mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
2. No evidence of pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Babesiosis: Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initial
admission for possible exchange transfusion given her extreme
parasite burden, however this was not necessary.  She was
monitored in the ICU and required intermittent boluses overnight
on hospital day #1 for sbp 80s.  ID was consulted and suggested
coverage with quinine and clindamycin, in addition to
doxycycline for possible concurrent Lyme or Ehrlichia.  Repeat
parasite smears trended down to 0.2% from > 50% at OSH, however,
patient's platelets continued to drop and she complained of
hearing loss concerning for possible cinchonism due to quinine.
She was thus switched to azithromycin and atovaqoune (through
[**9-13**]) and continued on the doxycycline (through [**9-21**]).
.
# Hemolytic anemia: Likely due to babesiosis.  Ferritin was >
[**2150**].  Folate and B12 were within normal limits.  Patient's
baseline hct was 38.5 in [**Month (only) 205**].  She was admitted to the OSH with
a hematocrit of 20.  She received a total of 4 U PRBC over the
course of her admission and her hematocrit on the day of
discharge was 32.5.  She was guiac negative during her hospital
stay.
.
# Thrombocytopenia:  Likely due to babesiosis.  Fibrinogen was
normal.  Platelets on day of discharge were up to 116.
.
# CHF: Developed in setting of IVF resuscitation.  On transfer
to the floor, patient was requiring 2 L supplemental O2 but this
resolved with autodiuresis.  CTA on transfer to the floor given
abnormal CXR in the ICU showed only mild CHF.
.
# Hyponatremia:  Likely was due to hypovolemia.  Returned to
[**Location 213**] with IVFs.
.
# Transaminitis:  Patient has baseline elevated AST, likely due
to alcohol use.  Ultrasound from '[**54**] normal.  Hepatitis
serologies were repeated this admission and were negative for
hep A and C antibody and showed borderline immune status to
hepatitis B without evidence of past infection.
.
# Diarrhea:  Patient had diarrhea during her hospital admission
which she stated was typical of her celiac sprue.  She normally
manages her symptoms with imodium.  C diff was negative x 4 and
patient was restarted on her imodium with good control of her
symptoms.
.
# Lupus: Asymptomatic without medications
.
# Hypertension:  BP meds initially held in the setting of
hypotension on admission.  Her blood pressure stabilized and her
BB and ACEI were restarted.  She will follow-up with her primary
care doctor as an outpatient to consider restarting her
diuretic.
.
# Osteopenia:  Patient was continued on calcium and fosamax and
started on vitamin D.
.
# Celiac sprue: Continued on B12.  Started on folate and vitamin
D supplementation.  Imodium prn.  Gluten-free diet.
.
# Recent ORIF for olecranon fx: Patient was scheduled for
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4304**] [**Name (S
