Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension and RLE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72 y.o man w/ NIDDM, CAD s/p MI x 2, class IV CHF (EF
20-25%), PVD, CRI who presented from his PCP's office on [**1-20**]
w/ asymptomatic BP 70's/40's and LE edema/pain in the setting of
cessation of lasix secondary to elevation in creatinine. He was
initially admitted to the MICU service for concern of sepsis
(given hypotension, hypothermia to 95, tachycardia 90's, wbc
3.6). Broad spectrum antibiotics were started (vancomycin and
levofloxacin), a dopamine infusion was started, and urine/blood
cultures were drawn.

At baseline, pt reports dyspnea w/ minimal to no exertion. He
denies chest pain. He is extremely compliant with his low sodium
diet, his medications. His lasix was stopped approx 10 days ago
for elevation in creatitine and concern for overdiuresis. His
weight has been stable in the 160's until he gained 10 lbs in
the last 6 weeks.

Past Medical History:
1) CAD, 3vd on last cath in [**2131**]- MI x 2 [**2131**], [**2143**]. MI in [**2143**]
was "silent" per pt's wife. [**Name (NI) 4084**] revascularized. In [**2131**], chose
medical mngt instead as pt was told his procedure was "high
risk"
2) CHF: echo [**2145-1-21**] w/ EF 20-35%,
3) DM 2
4) HTN
5) CRI: baseline cr 1.4-2.0 in past but has been 2-5.7 since
[**6-26**]
6) hyperlipidemia
7) PVD, s/p L BKA, and R femoral-tarsal bypass graft
8) hard of hearing, wears hearing aid

Social History:
Pt. lives his wife. [**Name (NI) **] six children and many grandchildren. He
used to work in for the gas company in [**Location (un) 1411**] but is now
retired. He is a nonsmoker. Drinks 3-5 beers once a week, but
not recently. He is DNR/DNI.

Family History:
Mom w/ CAD, DM, but unclear details.
Rest of history is unknown to patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 y.o man w/ h/o 3V CAD, MI X 2, CRI, IDDM, presents w/
asymptomatic hypotension, right lower extremity edema. During
his two days on the ICU service, he was afebrile with
normalization in his wbc's. He had no other focal signs of
infection and his cultures are negative to date. A cardiology
consultation was obtained upon admission given patient's
advanced heart failure and it was thought that the patient's
hypotension could also be due decompensated heart failure. Given
all of the above, he was transferred to the CCU service on [**1-22**]
for diuresis/heart failure management.
.
During the hospital stay the patient and family requested to
begin plans for hospice, palliative care team was involved and
pt was discharge to home with hospice care.
.
1. Hypotension: Etiology originally thought to be sepsis, but no
clear evidence: cultures negative, afebrile, no wbc. Patient not
adrenally insufficient as passed his [**Last Name (un) 104**]-stim test. His
hypotension likely due to decompenated CHF and lack of forward
flow. In the CCU he was continued on dopamine and started on
Natrecor with good effect of diuresis leading to normalizing of
blood pressure. Once the Natrecor was discontinued, a dopamine
wean was begun.  The blood pressure dropped off dopamine and so
it was restarted and eventually continued until two days before
discharge.  His levaquin and vancomycin were discontinued, given
the lack of evidence for infectious process.

2. Heart failure: Pt has EF 25% but w/ multiple valvlular
regurges (TR, MR, AR). His toprol, lasix were held, given low BP
and rising Cr. Started Natrecor infusion and continued low dose
dopa for BP support, renal perfusion. Natrecor worked with good
effect of diuresis leading to normalizing of blood pressure.  Pt
started on carvedilol with precipitous drop in blood pressure
and associated pulmonary edema, requiring restarting infusion of
dopamine until two days before discharge. Pt was also treated
with digoxin and lasix, continued upon discharge.

3. CAD: Had small trop leak but no evidence of acute ischemia.
Continued ASA/statin/plavix. BB held given hypotension.

4. CRI: Has had recent worsening of renal function over last 6
months. Likely progressing towards dialysis, but cr has been
improved slightly in CCU. Recent renal u/s showed echogenic 1.2
cm lesion on lower pole of left kidney. Pt was recommended to
have f/u MRI to further evaluate this but will likely not have
this in light of decision to commence hospice care.

5. Anemia: Macrocytic (new since [**9-26**]). Hct was 34 on [**1-8**].
Likely multifactorial, given acute on chronic renal disease. B12
and folate are normal, pt on B12.

6. DM: Well controlled.

7. Hypothyroid: TSH 13 on [**1-8**], but free t4 normal. He is on
levothyroxine.

8. PVD: s/p bipass on left LE and BKA on right. Has bilateral
ulcers that appear clean and non-infected. Continued aggressive
wound care.

9. FEN: Diabetic, low sodium diet
