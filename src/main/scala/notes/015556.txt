Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and substernal chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
57yo female former smoker with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia,
rheumatoid arthritis, COPD/asthma, Hep C admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**9-18**] with a presumed COPD exacerbation and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab [**9-19**] with presumed NSTEMI s/p cath
admitted to CCU for post-cath retroperitoneal bleed. Per patient
she has been having progressively worsening asthma symptoms
including shortness of breath (worse at night and with lying
flat) over the last 2-3 years. She saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] last year and
he diagnosed her with asthma/COPD with possible concomittant
restrictive physiology. She has been using her nebulizers at
home but has not been taking her other medications including
statin and anti-hypertensives. Over the last few weeks her
shortness of breath has been worsening. She denies worsening
orthopnea, PND, and lower extremity edema, but has had each of
these symptoms off and on for the last few years. She went to
see her PCP about ten days ago and he put her on prednisone for
a presumed COPD exacerbation. Per the patient this did not help.
.
Last night at about 4pm she experienced acute severe SOB at rest
associated with 8/10 substernal chest pain and a feeling like
she was going to die. She tried using her nebulizers but she did
not feel better so she called EMS who took her to [**Hospital **]
Hospital. There, she was treated for an asthma attack with
albuterol nebs and CPAP. ABG was 7.23/59/395 on CPAP. She then
received IV solumedrol. She was monitored overnight in the ICU
where her respiratory status improved very quickly. However, her
troponin I climbed from 0.06 on admission to 2.63 on the third
set with CKs flat but CKMBs rising to mid-20s. She was
subsequently diagnosed with an NSTEMI and treated with aspirin,
plavix load, heparin drip. Vital signs prior to transfer to cath
lab afebrile, BP 107/76 HR 80s RR 16-22 O2 sat 100% on 2L.
.
In cath lab patient underwent left heart catheterization during
which they found no occluded coronaries but anterior wall
hypokinesis with preserved EF (50%) on LV gram. Attempted access
through right side but unable to get adequate access so cath was
finished through the left side. Patient was then noted to be
hypotensive. She recevied pressors, 2 units pRBCs, and IVF in
the cath lab. Vascular surgery was consulted after pt was found
to have traumatic stick of right circumflex branch of femoral
artery. Underwent vascular coiling with good effect
angiographically post-procedure. On left side, pressure was
applied in cath lab for 45min and left with fem stop in place.
Right side stopped oozing and now transferred to CCU with
femoral pressure holder.
.
On arrival to CCU patient was breathing comfortably with no
complaints of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, leg pain, back pain, nausea.  She denied any
numbness/tingling/weakness.  She was on neosynephrine and
initally hypotensive but responded to IVF bolus.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2148-9-19**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
no
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
widely
patent.  The LAD and LCX were without disease.  The RCA had no
evidence
of stenosis.
2. Left ventriculography revealed anterolateral wall
akinesis-dyskinesis
with preserved contractile function of other walls.  The LVEF
was 54%.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Anterolateral wall dyskinesis.

[**2148-9-20**] Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the mid anterior septum and anterior walls. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
in an atypical/non-coronary distribution suggesting focal
myocarditis or variant of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Increased
PCWP. Mild aortic regurgitation.

[**2148-9-20**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
IMPRESSION: Moderate right retroperitoneal hematoma, with high
attenuation
material pooling in the pelvic portion of this collection most
consistent with
extravasated contrast not yet resorbed. Multiple high-
attenuation foci in
the right groin are compatible with closure device/coils.
