Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2201-5-14**]: Left atrium ablation
[**2201-5-19**]: Permanent Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
ablation again in the EP lab. She reported that she is
symptomatic from the tachycardia, with palpitations and anxiety.
Otherwise she is feeling well. She went to the cath lab today
for the AT ablation which was successful per signout. However,
after the case was finished, while still in the cath lab, she
had a sinus node arrest. She was asystolic for at least 7+
seconds and they initiated peripheral dopamine infusion. She
responded well with return of spontaneous sinus rhythm. She had
one additional pause to 3-4 seconds on transport to the CCU so
the dopamine was titrated up to 10 mcg/kg/min.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient is denying any chest pain or
shortness of breath. She does complain of lower back pain, which
is worse than her chronic pain. Her vitals on arrival were:
afebrile, BP 171/90, HR 102, RR 10, saturations 100% 2LNC. Her
dopamine was turned down to 7.5 mcg/kg/min because she was
tachycardic and hypertensive and then her vitals improved to
80s, 130s/70s.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM::

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2201-5-14**]: Horizontally oriented heart. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the right atrium. The right atrial appendage
ejection velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in
the right atrial appendage Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The ascending, transverse
and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of thrombus seen in body or appendage of
either atria. Depressed biatrial emptying velocities. Low normal
global left ventricular systolic function. Mild mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation.
.
CARDIAC MaPPING AND PRCEDURE:
We did 3-D electroanatomical mapping using CARTO. We first
started in the right atrium. The earliest site of activation was
at the interatrial septum. Under ICE guidance we then performed
single transseptal puncture to gain access to the left atrium. A
bolus of IV heparin along with continuous infusion was then
administered throughout the study to achieve an ACT greater than
300 seconds. Entrainment mapping from CS demonstrated long
return CL. CARTO activation mapping was then performed using a
Biosense Thermocool irrigated tip ablation catheter. On initial
mapping, it appeared that there was a focal AT with earliest
activation near the superior aspect of the common left pulmonary
[**Last Name (un) **]. Ablation at this site failed to terminate the arrhythmia.
We did further more detailed mapping around this area and now
the earliest site appeared to be at the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 109775**], but closer to
the base of the appendage. Ablation at this site also did not
affect the tachycardia. More extensive remapping now
demonstrated earlier sites near the anterior mid [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 109775**]. Again,
there appeared to be focal activation in a concentric manner.
Despite changing the early-meets-late threshold, we did not see
any evidence of a reentrant type circuit. Pacing from various
parts of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3780**] long return CLs, except when close
to the mid anterior roof. We then performed further ablation at
this site, but again there was no change in the AT. Since there
was a line of double potentials along the roof from a prior roof
line, we decided to re-inforce the roof line in case there were
any gaps in this was actually a reentrant rhythm. While burning
at the left anterior roof, the AT terminated with a 7 second
pause until CS pacing could resume. We then applied more RF all
along the roof line connecting the RSPV and the LCPV. We could
not verify that the roof line had complete bidirectional block
since we only had one catheter in the LA. However, there were
double potentials throughout the line or very low amplitude
signals.
After ablation, we delievered up to triple atrial extrastimuli
from the CS (max 400-200-200-200ms) and the LA and burst pacing
down to 270ms without induction of any arrhythmias. This was
repeated on and off of up to 6 mcg/min of Isuprel. The ablation
catheter was then removed from the LA. The opening LA pressure
was 18. The ending LA pressure was 22. The RA ending pressure
was 18mmHg.
The patient's underlying rhythm was still severe sinus brady
<30bpm. She was then started on dopamine 5 mcg/min which
promoted a junctional rhythm in the 50-70's with occasional
sinus P waves.
All catheters were then removed and sheaths were sutured in
place. 20 mg of protamine was administered intravenously to
reverse heparin. When the ACT was less than 180 seconds, the
sheaths were removed and manual compression held until
hemostasis was achieved. The patient was successfully extubated
at the end of the study and transferred to the PACU in stable
condition. She was continued on the dopamine 5mcg/min and if he
sinus node does not recover soon, she will be observed in the
CCU.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year old female with history of atrial
tachycardia but no coronary artery disease who presented to the
CCU status post atrial ablation on [**2201-5-14**] because she developed
asystole with pauses 7+ seconds.  Because she continued to have
pauses and symptomatic ventricular escape beats, she had
Pacemaker placement on [**2201-5-18**].
