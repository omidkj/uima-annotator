Service:  MICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old man
with a history of hypertension and seizure disorder who was
admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and hypotension.  He was in
his usual state of good health until two days prior to
admission when he had the onset of vertigo.  Since then, he
increasing lethargy.  On the day of admission, he suffered a
syncopal episode which he recalls occurred after vomiting.
He says this was unlike his seizure episodes.  He denies head
trauma or loss of consciousness.  He also denies fever,
chills, cough, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of
breath, hematuria, hematochezia and melena.

evaluation.  There he was afebrile and hypotensive with a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  After three liters of
isotonic intravenous fluids, his blood pressure remained in
the 70s with a heart rate in the 80s to 90s.  A nasogastric
tube was placed and lavage was trace positive for blood.  An
electrocardiogram was obtained which showed a new right
bundle branch block.  The patient's oxygen saturations were
in the 80s in room air but increased to mid 90s on four
liters nasal cannula oxygen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Seizure disorder since birth, last seizure five years
    ago.  Generalized tonoclonic seizures.
3.  Status post colovesical fistula repair in [**2164**].
4.  History of diverticulitis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Primidone 250 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2.  Atenolol dose unknown.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is a retired
restaurant worker and has grown children.  The patient smoked
four packs per day for thirty years before quitting in [**2144**].
He denies alcohol use or other drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient describes several relatives on
his father's side of the family who suffered Alzheimer's
disease.  No family history of coronary artery disease,
cancer or diabetes mellitus.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see history of present illness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed
temperature 98.0, pulse 86, blood pressure 96/52, respiratory

normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented times
three, but anxious.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Motor strength is 5/5 times four.  Deep tendon
reflexes are 1+ and symmetric throughout.  No clonus.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.7, hematocrit
47.4, platelets 325,000, 77% neutrophils, 18% lymphocytes, 5%
monocytes.  Prothrombin time 13.4, partial thromboplastin
time 27.4.  Sodium 145, potassium 3.6, chloride 93,
bicarbonate 28, blood urea nitrogen 44, creatinine 3.2,
glucose 150.  Anion gap was 24.  Lactate 1.8.  ALT 23, AST
49, alkaline phosphatase 114, amylase 96, total bilirubin
0.6.  CPK 120, CK MB 1.0, troponin I less than 0.3.  Albumin
4.8.  Abdomen revealed pH 7.42/45/58.

IMAGING:  KUB revealed no free air.  Bowel gas pattern
throughout small and large intestines.  Chest x-ray revealed
hyperinflated lung fields with flat diaphragms, no
pneumothorax, no infiltrate, appropriate line placement.

Electrocardiogram - normal sinus rhythm, new right bundle
branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's hypoxia, hypotension and new
onset right bundle branch block with new onset syncope were
most worrisome for pulmonary embolism.  The patient was
started on Heparin and a VQ scan was obtained because the
creatinine was too high for a CT angiogram.  The VQ scan was
low probability.  The patient was ruled out for an acute
myocardial infarction.  An echocardiogram was also obtained
during this admission which showed hyperdynamic left
ventricle with an ejection fraction of 75%.  The right
ventricle had a normal cavity size and normal function.  No
evidence of strain.  Lower extremity Doppler was also
obtained which showed no clot in his veins.

The patient was started on Dopamine in the Emergency
Department after left subclavian line was placed for blood
pressure support.  This was quickly weaned off in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit as the patient's blood pressure responded
well to isotonic fluid resuscitation.  Over the course of his
admission after receiving aggressive volume repletion, the
patient's creatinine corrected to 1.6 and his hematocrit
corrected to 35.0.

With a more reassuring creatinine, a CT study of the chest
was obtained with contrast and this was negative for
pulmonary embolism.  Pulmonary function tests were also
obtained to identify an etiology for his hypoxia and these
were remarkable for a FEV1/FVC ratio of 70% predicted and
RV/TLC of 118 and a markedly reduced diffusion coefficient of
only 39%. The chest CT was also remarkable for right middle lobe
and right lower lobe cyst formation and interstitial scarring
which are not completely consistent with injury due to tobacco
smoke but more consistent with a pneumoconiosis.

A urine and blood toxicology screen were obtained at the time
of admission to rule out ingestion as the cause of his
hypotension.  These were negative except for a positive
barbiturate level which may have been due to sedatives
administered in the Emergency Department.

The patient's antiseizure medication Primidone was held
initially but was then restarted one day after being admitted
and the patient suffered no seizures while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  He initially received a dose of
Ampicillin and Gentamicin and Flagyl in the Emergency
Department because they were worried about sepsis as the
cause for his hypoxia and hypotension, however, his clinical
status improved greatly upon receiving aggressive volume
repletion and nasal cannula oxygen and it was felt that both
his history and presentation were inconsistent with an
infectious etiology so antibiotics were discontinued.

The patient's basophil count came back at 3% on [**2168-8-12**].
This was followed up by examining the peripheral blood smear
with a hematology/pathology physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18081**].  It was his feeling that the smear showed no
evidence of a malignancy.  A follow-up differential showed a
basophil count of 0.2%.

The patient's CPKs rose to 465 during his admission, but
serial CPKs after that have returned to the normal range.

On the evening prior to discharge, the patient spiked a
temperature of 101.0.  Blood and urine cultures have been
sent off.  Stool leukocytes and ova and parasite studies have
also been sent off because it was the feeling of our team
that this illness may have been a severe gastroenteritis that
led to dehydration and volume depletion with subsequent
hypotension.

While on Heparin, the patient suffered mild Foley trauma and
had mild hematuria which appears to be resolving.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is stable and ready for
discharge to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe interstial/fibrotic, predominantly lower-lobe,
uncertain etiology (atypical for tobacco- related COPD)
2.  Status post severe gastroenteritis.
3.  Hypotension secondary to dehydration
4.  Epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:   Primidone 250 mg p.o. t.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP:
1.  Home oxygen therapy will be arranged by case manager.
2.  The patient needs follow-up with pulmonary specialist.
    This should be arranged by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Month (only) 18082**] office.
    Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 216**] is the patient's primary care physician.
