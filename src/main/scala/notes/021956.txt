HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66 year-old
male who presents with severe esophageal burning that
radiates to his back, which started after eating some old
apple pie.  The pain is not improved by Protonix or Maalox.
He has had some nausea and vomiting, but does not complain of
any chest pain or shortness of breath.  He has had similar
symptoms in the past secondary to previous diagnosed peptic
ulcer disease.  This is chronically treated with proton pump
inhibitors and were well controlled with Prilosec, but the
patient was recently switched to Protonix due to insurance
issues.

Of note, in the Emergency Department the patient was noted to
have head bobbing and left hand shaking.  He has a history of
alcohol abuse, but states that he has not consumed alcohol in
the last twelve years.  In the Emergency Department the
patient was noted to have a change in mental status with some
hallucinations.  He was treated with Ativan 2 mg intravenous
times two, given the banana bag as well as intravenous
Phenergan.  He was admitted to the MICU for evaluation of
possible delirium tremens.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Alcohol abuse discontinued twelve
years ago.  2.  Possible chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  3.  Peptic ulcer disease, history of H-pylori
treated with antibiotics.  4.  Crypt organism on the right
side.  5.  Cervical spondylosis C5 to C6.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  1.  Protonix 40 mg po q day.  2.  Wellbutrin
150 mg po b.i.d.  3.  Atrovent meter dose inhaler two to
three puffs q.i.d.  4.  Neurontin 100 mg po t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes two packs per day.  He
has a history of alcohol abuse.  Questionable history of
intravenous drug use and a history of homelessness.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a
temperature of 98.6, heart rate 82, blood pressure 128/63,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 99% on room air.  In
general, the patient is a mildly obese male in no acute
distress.  Head and neck examination was significant for
pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Clear
oropharynx.  There was no lymphadenopathy, elevated JVD or
neck stiffness.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal
examination revealed positive bowel sounds, nontender, and no
masses.  Extremities showed no clubbing or edema with good
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  There was no rigidity or
clonus noted on neurological examination.  The patient moved
all four extremities, but would not cooperate with
neurological examination.

LABORATORY:  Significant for a white blood cell count of
12.4.  Panel 7 was within normal limits.  ALT and AST were
within normal limits.  Amylase was slightly elevated at 105,
with a normal lipase of 24.  LDH was 326, alkaline
phosphatase was 162 and total bilirubin was 0.3.  Chest x-ray
revealed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.  A right upper
quadrant ultrasound revealed the presence of gallstones with
no dilated bile ducts.  Electrocardiogram revealed normal
sinus rhythm with no ST or T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Neurology:  The patient was evaluated
for possible delirium tremens, but had no tachycardia or
hypertension.  Serum and urine tox screen negative.  A
noncontrast head CT was performed and was negative.  Lumbar
puncture was performed and revealed 1 white blood cell and 0
red blood cells.  Glucose was normal and protein was slightly
elevated at 63.  Cultures were pending at the time of
discharge.  Gram stains were negative.  RPR was negative as
was cryptococcus antigen.  Herpes simplex virus PCR was
pending at the time of discharge.  The patient was initially
treated with intravenous antibiotics for possible bacterial
meningitis, but this was discontinued when the results of the
lumbar puncture were returned.  The patient was treated with
intravenous Thiamine and folate as well as multivitamins.  He
displayed no seizure activity in the first 24 hours of his
hospitalization, though he still remained confused and
lethargic at times.  An electroencephalogram was performed in
the MICU and showed no epileptiform features.  The patient
was transferred to the floor on [**2196-11-13**].  At this time the
patient had some witnessed seizure like activity, which began
with left arm shaking and bilateral foot twitching.  Nearly
after these episodes the patient loss consciousness for
several minutes, but then was awake and responsive.  A repeat
electroencephalogram was performed on [**2196-11-14**] and still
revealed no epileptiform features with only mild
encephalopathy.  An MRI of the head showed no mass lesions
and a possible right internal carotid artery bifurcation
aneurysm.  An MRA was then performed on [**11-15**] and showed only
tortuosity of the internal carotid artery.  The patient was
evaluated by neurology, which did not feel that his seizure
like activities represented seizures.  The patient did not
lose consciousness during many of these episodes.  Acyclovir
was discontinued due to the very low suspicion for herpes
simplex virus encephalitis.  At the time of discharge the
patient was alert and oriented times three, conversant, and
cooperative.  It was believed that his prior lethargy and
confusion may be related to hypersensitivity to
benzodiazepines.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient's esophagitis resolved
within the first 24 hours of hospitalization.  He was
increased to twice a day dosing of his proton pump inhibitor
and should follow up with a gastroenterologist for evaluation
of esophagitis or esophageal spasm.  At the time of discharge
the patient was tolerating oral intake well.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient discharged in stable
condition to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Esophagitis/esophageal spasm.
2.  Altered mental status, possibly related to benzodiazepine
reaction.
3.  Peptic ulcer disease.
4.  History of H-pylori infection treated with antibiotics.
5.  Possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  History of alcohol abuse.
7.  Cryptorchism.
8.  Cervical spondylosis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Protonix 40 mg po b.i.d.  2.
Wellbutrin 150 mg po b.i.d.  3.  Atrovent meter dose inhaler
two to three puffs po q.i.d.  4.  Neurontin 100 mg po t.i.d.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  1.  The patient will increase his dosing of
Protonix to b.i.d.  2.  The patient will follow up with his
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2961**] on [**2196-11-21**] at
