Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
R iliac vein bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right iliac vein packing


History of Present Illness:
77 year old female transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] s/p right hip
acetabular clean out and removal of infected hardware on [**12-8**]
(presumed to be seeded from septic shoulder) for evaluation of
intraoperative bleeding.  Wound left open and packed and
angiogram negative at OSH.  Transferred emergently to [**Hospital1 18**]
where right iliac vein was packed x's 2.  Had IVC filter placed
on [**12-9**] in setting of Afib and not able to anticoagulate d/t
bleed.
.
While in the SICU the patient has had intermittent episodes of
hypotension supported by fluids, blood, and neosynephrine
([**Date range (1) 35685**]), felt to be d/t blood loss vs. sepsis.  Also with
repeated episodes of A fib, the first treated with diltiazem
gtt, the second amiodarone load, and the third repeat amiodarone
load.  Of note, the patient first became febrile to 101.5 on
[**12-11**] and ppx cefazolin was changed to vanc/levo/flagyl and PICC
and swan pulled.  She grew Serratia and Enterobacter in sputum
and blood cultures from [**12-11**].  Subsequent OSH records were
available showing MSSA in wound (? bld) and vancomycin was
changed to Ancef.  Patient self extubated on [**12-12**] and was
immediately reintubated but then electively extubated on [**12-14**].
Was doing fairly well until the patient developed sustained VT
times 2 last night, the first of which she spontaneously
converted out of and the second of which required shock,
intubation, and pressors.  Since then the patient has remained
hypotensive with SBP 70-90's and bradycardic with HR in 50's.
.
Currently the patient is intubated and sedated and unable to
answer ROS questions.

CXR [**2105-1-7**]:
Large pneumoperitoneum persists, smaller since 6:31 p.m. on
[**1-6**]. The tip of an enterostomy or gastrostomy tube
projects over the left paramedian abdomen and appears to
cannulate either a loop of bowel or a length of tubing, which is
directed superiorly projecting over a collection of air above
the diaphragm presumably in the thoracic portion of a gastric
hiatus hernia. As I discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], I am unfamiliar
with any such appliance, and it is important to review these
radiographs with the surgical team in light of their description
of patient's abdominal procedure yesterday.
.
Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved slightly since
[**1-6**] accompanied by persistent small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly. There is no
pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. Right
internal jugular line tip projects over the upper right atrium.
.
Note is made of the comminuted healing fracture of the right
upper humerus. A caval umbrella filter projects over the
inferior vena cava, close to the level of the renal veins.
.

CT Torso [**2105-1-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of free intraperitoneal air.
2. Gastrostomy tube is seen adjacent to the anterior wall of the
stomach. Injection of contrast material showed no leak. There is
a discrepancy in gastric wall thickness covering the gastrostomy
tube retainer compared to the thickness of the gastric wall
elsewhere. While this is most likely located within the stomach,
with thinning of the anterior aspect of the gastric wall due to
tethering by the gastrostomy tube, location of the PEG tube
retainer within the gastric wall cannot be completely excluded.
Consultation with the surgery service who placed the tube should
be performed prior to using the tube for tube feeds.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions. Right effusion appears
simple. The left effusion may be loculated given posterior
tethering of the left lung. No frank enhancing septations are
identified.
4. Small amount of pneumomediastinum.
5. Tracheostomy tube cuff appears slightly hyperinflated.
6. Patchy areas of ground-glass opacity in aerated portions of
both lungs with superimposed more confluent areas of opacity.
Findings could be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema or
superimposed infection.
7. Bone destruction and fluid collection in right
acetabulum/proximal right femur consistent with known hardware
infection. Post-traumatic changes in the right shoulder. L2
compression deformity, as described on prior [**2104-12-27**]
MRI.

.
MRI brain [**2105-1-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited due to significant amounts of patient motion
artifact. The internal carotid arteries as well as the basilar
artery appear patent. There is some flow signal present also
within the middle cerebral, anterior, and posterior cerebral
arteries.
.
TTE [**2104-12-31**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is hard to assess given the limited views but
susptect it is mildly decreasedl (LVEF 45-55%).  [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given
the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is hard t oassess given the limited views but suspect
normal
function.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2) Mild to moderate
([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.  5.The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe thickening of
the mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
6.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
