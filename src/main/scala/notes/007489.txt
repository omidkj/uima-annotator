Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
melena, hct drop

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy with push enteroscopy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 33347**] an 81 M with history of AF on coumadin until recent
UGIB (gastritis) in the setting of INR 22, prior history of PE,
MR/TR, recurrent pleural effusion who was transferred back to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] with persistently dropping hct and
melena. At last admission, he presented with a HCT of 12.5 and
confusion in the setting of INR 22. His INR was reversed with
vitamin K and 4 units of FFP. He received a total of 10 units of
PRBC during that admission. On prior admission, an EGD was
performed which showed only mild gastritis and no active
bleeding. A colonoscopy showed moderate diverticulosis but also
no signs of active bleeding. A benign appearing polyp was also
removed. He was discharged after several days of stable
hematocrits. His hospital course was complicated by subacute L
superior cerebellar stroke, and he was placed back on lovenox
and coumadin.
.
Since his discharge, the patient is complaining of dyspnea with
exertion over last 2 days but no rest dyspnea. Denies abd pain,
n/v, hematemasis, BRBPR, melena, chest pain, LH, orthopnea, PND,
weight gain. Pt is not sure about melena as he doesn't check his
stools. INR 1.4 at OS lab.
.
In ED, + melenic stools with positive guaiac. Pt did not
tolerated NG lavage due to deviated septum with obstructed L
nare. Pt was given iv protonix and 1 unit of PRBC for hct 25
(prior to d/c on [**5-20**] hct 30). There was a question of ST
depression laterally and 1st cardiac enzymes were negative.
.
In the ED patient got 1 unit of PRBC. He remained
hemodynamically stable. Small bowel enteroscopy and EGD which
showed gastritis and a small angioectasia in the proximal ileum
which was treated with thermal therapy. GI is recommending Q8H
Hct checks. Per GI, it is okay to resume heparin. Most recent
Hct 27.6 (up from 23.6).
.
Currently, pt has no complaints. He is resting comfortable after
EGD/enteroscopy.

Pertinent Results:
ECG: AF at 64, LAD, IVCD, no acute ST/ t wave changes compared
to [**2112-5-6**] ECg.
.
Echo [**5-9**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is markedly dilated. The
left ventricle is normal in wall thickness, caviity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+]tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
inferolateralpericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-9-21**],
minimal aortic stenosis is now suggested and a very small
inferolateral pericardial effusion is now identified.
.
[**2112-5-11**] Colonoscopy:
Findings:
 Protruding Lesions A single sessile 6 mm polyp of benign
appearance was found in the proximal rectum at 14cm. A
piece-meal polypectomy was performed using a cold forceps. The
polyp was completely removed. Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were
noted.
 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula with medium openings
were seen in the proximal sigmoid colon and mid-sigmoid
colon.Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
Impression: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Polyp at 14cm in the proximal rectum (polypectomy)
Diverticulosis of the proximal sigmoid colon and mid-sigmoid
colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
.
EGD:

Brief Hospital Course:
8A/P: 81yo M with recurrent left-sided pleural effusion of
unclear etiology, afib on anticoagulation, recent embolic stroke
(while off anti-coagulation), admitted with recurrent GI bleed,
transferred to ICU with acute respiratory failure.
.
# Respiratory failure (hypoxic and hypercarbic):  The patient
with history of chronic left sided pleural effusion s/p several
taps in the last year. The source is unknown but concerning for
malignant process given history of asbestos exposure, but
cytology has been negative. The acute respiratory event is most
likely secondary to left sided pleural effusion reaccumulation
vs. hemothorax in the setting of anticoagulation. Bedside
thoracentesis was attempted but aborted due to difficulties with
aspiration. Other possible explanations for decompensation
include PE (less likely as no significant tachycardia and the
patient has been anticoagulated), mucous plugging, CHF, flash
pulmonary edema.
On [**2112-6-15**], pt intubated for increasing hypercarbia & work of
breathing. A left sided thoracentesis was performed by IP with
drainage of 600cc of bloody fluid. A chest tube was then placed.
CT chest showed trapped L lung w/ incompletely drained L
effusion. Large right sided effusion w/ associated atelectasis
+/- consolidation.
Pt's acute respiratory failure thought to be due to worsening
left hemothorax, which may have worsened spontaneously with
bleeding on anti-coagulation vs pleural bleeding after
unsuccessful thoracentesis on [**2112-6-15**] vs malignancy.  Other
contributors to pt's respiratory failure include possible
hospital acquired PNA, ? COPD, and possibly CHF.  Pt treated for
all of the above.  Respiratory failure resolving as of [**2112-6-22**].
His chest tube removed.  Pt extubated on [**2112-6-20**].
- treated for COPD exacerbation with nebs standing, steroids and
Vanc & Zosyn
- Pt diuresed w/ lasix
- BiPAP if necessary
- strict ins/outs
- patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33348**] and offered surgical options, but
pt and family declined and wanted pursue thoracenteses for
right-sided effustion.
- Antibiotics discontinued on [**2112-6-22**] after 8day course w/
vanc/zosyn for possible PNA
.
# AF: Currently HD stable.
- Continue beta blocker if BPs tolerates.
- No anti-coagulation given recurrent GI bleed as well as recent
hemothorax.
.
# Cardiomyopathy: EF stable at 55%.
- Giving lasix to diurese ORN
- strict ins/outs
