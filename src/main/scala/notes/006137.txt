Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old male with recent diagnosis of CAD
(non-intervenable 3VD) who was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2196-1-1**] after 4 day hospitalization for chest pain who
presented to OSH after 7-10 minutes of shortness of breath this
morning, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
management.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] first presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2195-12-28**] on transfer from
OSH for catheterization after experiencing several episodes
chest pain over the prevoius 4-5 days. He had multiple episodes
of chest pain, at rest, felt like weight on his chest,
accompanied by shortness of breath and dizziness. Denied
palpitations, nausea, vomitting. During his previous [**Hospital1 18**]
admission, he had cardiac catheterization which showed 3VD with
totally occluded LAD and RCA and EF 30% that was not ameniable
to intervention. He was medically maximized and discharged home
for planned CABG on Thursday [**2196-1-7**]. Of note, there was Code
Stroke called for new left facial droop on [**12-29**], CT and MRI head
negative. Droop resolved. The morning after discharge, he was
walking around his house and experienced 7 minutes of shortness
of breath with mild chest pressure. The shortness of breath
recurred later in the morning and he went to [**Hospital3 **] for
evaluation. He states the chest pain is different than prior,
however he did experience SOB before previous admission. At
[**Hospital3 **], Troponin 0.02, chest pain free since admitted,
started on heparin gtt and loaded with 600 mg plavix at 1537.
On review of systems, he denies history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion
with 3 blocks of ambulation (worsening over months) and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea; denies orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Final Report
HISTORY: Status post CABG, evaluation for interval change.
COMPARISON: [**2196-1-13**].
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is
marked
improvement. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has
completely resolved.
The left pleural effusion has minimally decreased in extent,
leading to
improved ventilation of the left basal lung. The shape of the
cardiac
silhouette can be better delineated. Unchanged are the
post-infectious small granulomas at the right lung apex.
Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube.
Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.
