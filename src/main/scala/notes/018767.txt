History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 50789**] is a 40 yo F with AML, admitted for a
sibling-matched [**Known lastname 51240**].

Onc history: She was first diagnosed with AML approximately 20
years ago when she presented with pancytopenia.  She underwent
7+3+3 induction chemotherapy and two cycles of high dose
cytarabine consolidation and attained a complete remission.  She
was lost to follow-up until she presented in [**8-17**] with
pancytopenia and  AML.  She was re-induced with 7+3, received
three cycles of high dose cytarabine consolidation, and went
into complete remission. She remained in remission until [**6-19**]
when she noted increasing lower extremity bone pain and fatigue
and a CBC revealed a decreased white blood count with
circulating blasts.  She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], had a Hickman
line placed, and was induced with 7+3, again attaining complete
remission.  Her post-induction course was complicated by E. coli
bacteremia for which she was treated with a 14 day course of
levofloxacin.

Recent history: She had a tooth extraction on [**9-4**]. Following
that, she developed some left facial numbness and was treated
with Valtrex and clindamycin for possible shingles and tooth
infection. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-11**] with a fever of
unknown source. She was found to have suspected Nocardia
bacteremia of an unclear etiology. Her Hickman line was removed,
she was treated with Bactrim, became afebrile, and was
discharged on [**9-17**] on Bactrim DS 2 tabs tid.

Since her discharge she has felt well.  She denies fevers,
chills, or sweats.  She does endorse a congestion sensation in
her left sinus but denies any pain or pressure.  She denies
headaches, sore throat, cough, dyspnea, abd pain, dysuria,
diarrhea, or new rashes.

Past Medical History:
1. AML - dx 17 yrs ago.  in remission after induction chemo.  no
consolidation therapy.  relapsed in [**2198**].
2. Panic attacks/anxiety
3. Peripheral neuropathy secondary to chemo, responsive to
oxycodone.
4. Chronic left sided sinusitis, thought to be due to a
structural problem.
5. Ovarian cyst.
6. H/O line infections with E. coli, Nocardia

Surgical history:
1. s/p C4-6 fusion due to herniated disk in [**2193**]
2. s/p Tubal ligation.
3. s/p Tonsillectomy.

Social History:
She lives in [**Location 8117**], NH with her husband and two children, ages
12 and 15.  She has previously lived in [**Location **], MA.  She is not
currently working. They have an adult dog with no medical
issues, shots up to date.  She has travelled to [**Location (un) 11177**],
[**Country 149**] ([**2187**]), NY, ME, PA.  No other foreign travel.  She does
not drink alcohol for a "long time" and smokes marijuana

Imaging:
[**2200-9-26**] Chest CT:
1. Partial resolution of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Unchanged nodule in superior segment of left lower lobe.
.
Lower Ext dopplers [**10-24**]: Technically limited study. No evidence
of left lower extremity DVT.
.
Abdominal Sono [**10-30**]: 1. [**Name2 (NI) **] portal veins are patent with
hepatopetal flow.
2. Left and main hepatic veins are patent, with limited
evaluation of
phasicity secondary to patient respiration. The right hepatic
vein is
incompletely evaluated. 3. Slight interval decrease in
right-sided pleural effusion. 4. Moderate intraabdominal
ascites. 5. 2.2 x 1.6 x 1.9 cm hypoechoic lesion adjacent to IVC
within right liver lobe. This was not seen on prior ultrasound,
but is not significantly changed since prior CT dated [**2200-10-12**], and likely represents a hemangioma. 6. Interval
significant decrease in gallbladder wall edema. 7. Stable size
of spleen compared with prior CT dated [**2200-10-12**].
.
X-ray foot [**10-30**]: Soft tissue changes as described. No fracture
or cortical fragmentation
.
CT head [**11-3**]: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage
.
CT Torso 9/19:1. Interval development and worsening of diffuse
bilateral ground glass opacity within the lungs with multiple
areas of more dense nodular opacity and collapse/consolidation
of the right lower lobe with bilateral pleural effusions.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes
infectious/inflammatory processes, CHF, and ARDS. 2. Splenic
infarcts.
3. Large perfusion defect in the right lobe of the liver
worrisome for
hepatic infarct. The portal vein and hepatic arteries appear
patent, although contrast enhancement is less brisk/robust
compared to the prior study. The right hepatic vein stump is
opacified with lack of opacification of the majority of the
right hepatic vein, 4. Anasarca with increased ascites. 5.
Bilateral expanded appearance of the flanks with loss of the
normal fat plane between the flank musculature that may
represent edema or swelling. A hematoma cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**11-4**] (last CXR): Right and left central venous lines and ET
tube are in stable
position. Allowing for marked right-sided rotation, findings are
not
significantly changed. There are large bilateral pleural
effusions and
persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema. No

pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No significant change from the previous exam.
