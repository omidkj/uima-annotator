Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Problems with speech
Right sided clumsiness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR guided PICC


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 53 year-old right-handed man with a PMH of  afib off
coumadin, HTN, HLD, DM and EtOH use who presented to the ED with
difficulty with his speech and clumsiness.

He states that he stopped coumadin several months ago as he ran
out. He did not pursue a refill. This morning he woke in his
USOH. He watched TV in the morning and noticed intermittent
episodes of problems with his vision on the R side. It was not
complete visual loss and he is unable to describe if it was a
portion of vision missing vs blurriness. This resolved, however
around 3 pm he had abrupt onset difficulty with his speech. He
states the he was barely able to speak but was clear about what
he wanted to say. He also noticed that his R hand was very
clumsy. He denied numbness or focal weakness however. He waited
for several hours and went to the grocery store. He then called
his recently separated wife around 7 pm. She noticed that he
speech was non-fluent with very limited phrases and was
concerned. She thought he had either consumed EtOH or "was
sick". She picked him up and brought him to the ED.

Pertinent Results:
TTE from [**12-18**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**9-28**] %). A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade
III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severely depressed left ventricular systolic and
diastolic dysfunction. Depressed right ventricular function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Cannot exclude left ventricular apical
thrombus.

Stroke in the left MCA superior division territory.Left
fronto-temporal hypodensity with increased MTT, decreased blood
flow. No cut off seen on vessels.


Brief Hospital Course:
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2102-3-15**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is

[**2102-3-14**] CTA head: No acute intracranial process with no abnormal
enhancement, infarction or hemorrhage.

#. CAD: Pt has h/o CAD per records. He had a cath sometime in
the past at [**Hospital1 2177**] which showed  90% LAD lesion but not stented.
Started coreg for BP control as well as captopril. Continued ASA
81. Held statin in setting of transaminitis but may consider
starting as o/p if liver function tests wnl.

#. Pump: Pt has severe systolic and diastolic CHF and
cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 10. The cardiomyopathy is likely
from CAD and alcohol use. Initially, pt seemed volume overloaded
and at that point on his starling curve where is not able to
mainten enough cardiac output. On lasixc gtt patient was
diuresed. He then was put on a PO dose of lasix for maintenance
once he was euvolemic. He was started on an ace inhibitor and
coreg. He was continued on asa. Statin was held as below. He
will discuss with his cardiologist whether he may benefit from
an AICD if on follow up TTE's he continues
