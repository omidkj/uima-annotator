CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year-old
male with a history of CLL with massive splenomegaly,
thrombocytopenia, anemia, fistulizing Crohn's disease status
post ileostomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
restrictive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, systemic
hypertension who was admitted recently at [**Hospital1 346**] from [**2105-3-7**] to [**2105-3-17**] for upper GI
bleed, hypotension, pneumococcal pneumonia with sepsis status
post intubation who had presented after discharge to
Leminster follow up with dyspnea, lower extremity edema,
weight gain and lower extremity cellulitis on the [**4-1**].  The patient was diuresed and transfused 2 units of
packed red blood cells.  He was given Levofloxacin for
cellulitis.  Given the patient's multiple comorbidities and
worsening respiratory status his oncologist and primary care
physician at [**Name9 (PRE) 48159**] elected to make the patient hospice
care.  However, the patient's daughter requested transfer to
[**Hospital1 69**] for reevaluation and
further management.  Also at the outside hospital the patient
was ruled out for myocardial infarction and treated for
pneumonia with Ceftriaxone.  Cardiology there did not feel
the patient was in left sided heart failure.  He had an
echocardiogram performed there that showed decreased right
ventricular function.  BiPAP was tried several times without
benefit.  A chest x-ray was negative for congestive heart
failure.  The patient had a central line placed in the
subclavian position on the day of transfer.  On arrival to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit the patient denied any fevers
or chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood
in stools, urinary symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath
at rest, cough or sputum.  The patient denies ever having
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.  The
patient did note that when he was discharged from rehab after
his admission to [**Hospital1 69**] from
[**Month (only) 958**] to [**Month (only) 547**] he was not discharged on his diuretics.  He
had been eating a relatively high salt diet as well.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a [**Country 3992**] Veteran.  He lives
with his wife and daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] drank heavy in the past and
quit in the recent past.  He has a history of heavy tobacco
use and quit in [**2104-9-16**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature is 97.6 with
a pulse of 90. Respiratory rate 28.  Blood pressure 94/51.
Oxygen saturation of 91% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  CVP was
estimated by triple lumen catheter to be 12 mm of water.  On
general examination the patient was a very ill appearing male
in no acute distress, alert and oriented times three.  HEENT
revealed extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes are moist.
Neck examination revealed CVP of about 12 cm of water.
Normal thyroid.  Normal lymphadenopathy.  Cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2.
Positive S3, prior sternal heave and 1 out of 6 systolic
descrendo murmur at the left upper sternal border.  Pulmonary
examination revealed long E time, otherwise lungs that had
decreased breath sounds at the bases left greater then right.
 On abdominal examination the patient had slight tenderness
in the left lower quadrant without rebound or guarding.  He
had multiple abdominal scars, ileostomy in the right lower
quadrant and was nondistended.  Extremity examination
revealed 2+ edema with a right lower extremity having some
erythema and warmth and multiple ecchymosis petechia and
purpura all over his extremities from previous blood draws.
Neurological examination revealed the patient was alert and
oriented times three.  Ileostomy looked pink and healthy with
guaiac negative output.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  The patient had a white blood cell
count of 23, hematocrit 30.5, platelets of 62.  Chem 7
revealed sodium of 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 98, bicarb of
34, BUN 37, creatinine 1.0 and glucose of 68.  The patient
had a reticulocyte count of 7.1.  His iron saturation was
less then 30%.  He had an LDH of 768 with a total bilirubin
of 2.9 and an indirect bilirubin of 2.1.  His Cortisol was
within normal limits as well as his TSH.  B-12 and folate
were within normal limits.  Calcium was 9.5, magnesium was
2.0 and phos 2.8.

PERTINENT PAST DATA:  The patient had an echocardiogram
performed at his last admission with an EF of 75 to 80%, 1+
tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension.  The
patient had an upper gastrointestinal series, which showed
massive spleen and inflammatory changes to the small bowel in
[**2105-2-14**].  The patient had an abdominal ultrasound on
[**2105-2-14**], which showed massive spleen, dilated portal
veins and normal flow.  The patient had a chest x-ray at the
outside hospital, which showed bilateral basilar infiltrates
and effusions left greater then right.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 56 year-old male with a
history of CLL, massive splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia,
anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
restriction, cor pulmonale secondary to pulmonary
hypertension, fistulizing Crohn's who presents with dyspnea.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was transferred for further
evaluation of his declining pulmonary status.  His clinical
examination and repeat echocardiogram showed severe and
progressive cor pulmonale likely secondary to severe
pulmonary hypertension from pulmonary parenchymal disease.
His dyspnea was probably complicated by chronic anemia,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and restrictive lung
disease as well.  An echocardiogram did not reveal any left
ventricular component to suggest congestive heart failure,
although he did hve very severe right ventricular
dysfunction.  The patient admitted to some hemoptysis while
in the hospital that he had for approximately one month and
had not discussed with any physicians.  Given his history of
smoking this was concerning for a primary lung malignancy.
The patient had a CT scan performed, which showed
endobronchial filling defect with question of tumor versus
mucous impaction.  Distal to the filling defect there was
ground glass opacities that was consistent with hemorrhage or
a post obstructive pneumonia.  After this finding he was
started on Azithromycin as he had a Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin
resistant Pneumococcal pneumonia in the same distribution as
the last admission.  He had bilateral pleural effusions right
greater then left, which had recurred quickly after being
tapped at the outside hospital.  CT angiogram was performed,
which did not reveal any evidence of pulmonary embolism.  The
patient's chronic steroids were attempted to be tapered.  He
was treated with Albuterol and Atrov
