Micro:
[**2119-1-17**]: BAL no growth, [**2118-1-22**] BC x 2 NGTD, Urine Cx no
growth

CXR:
[**2119-1-24**]: the extensive air inclusions in the pectoral and
cervical as well as thoracic predominantly right-sided soft
tissues are unchanged.

[**2119-1-23**]: the right pigtail catheter has been removed. Again
extensive gas overlying the right chest and along the right
chest wall and neck greatly obscures detail. There may be a
small residual pneumothorax.
[**2119-1-21**] & [**2119-1-22**]: stable tiny right apical pneumothorax with
stable subcutaneous emphysema
[**2119-1-20**]: interval placement of a right pigtail pleural catheter
within
the upper apex. The previously seen pneumothorax is not well
appreciated;
however, this is partially due to the subcutaneous emphysema
throughout the right chest wall. The left-sided pacemaker is
unchanged in position. The lung fields are likely clear. There
is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
[**2119-1-19**]: There is no evidence of left-sided apical
pneumothorax. The previously identified postoperative local
apical
pneumothorax status post recent VATS procedure remains stable.
It may have
decreased slightly.
[**2119-1-18**]: There is no evidence of left-sided apical
pneumothorax. The previously identified postoperative local
apical pneumothorax status post recent VATS procedure remains
stable. It may have decreased slightly. The previously described
mostly right-sided chest wall emphysema continues again into the
lower neck area bilaterally and is still very prominent. No new
abnormalities are identified
[**2119-1-17**]: There is slight increase in right apical pneumothorax,
and expected slight decrease in size of a post-operative
hematoma continuous with the right upper mediastinal contour.
There has been no interval development of consolidation or
pleural effusion. The right apical chest tube and dual-lead left
chest cardiac pacer are unchanged. The osseous structures appear
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Slight increase in right apical pneumothorax.
[**2119-1-15**]: Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, including the
known right pneumothorax, right paramediastinal parenchymal
consolidation, periatrial gas inclusion, and position of the
right chest tube.

inflammation, fibrinous exudate, and granulation tissue,
consistent with prior surgery; no malignancy identified.
VI. Right upper lobe (M-AG):

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**] was admitted following VATS converted to open
thoracotomy, right upper
lobectomy with en bloc right lower lobe superior segment wedge,
mediastinal lymph node dissection.  He was extubated in the
operating room transferred to the PACU. While in the PACU he
developed respiratory distress oxygen saturations 70% requiring
NRB oxygen saturation 88-90%.  He was transferred to the TSICU.
While in the TSICU he had an episode of flash pulmonary edema
requiring, IV Lasix, Nitro, Morphine.  His respiratory improved
slightly but declined again. CPAP was attempted but the patient
was unable to tolerate therefore was intubated and sedated and
given IV steroids.  His respiratory status improved and he was
successfully extubated 24 hours later with oxygen saturations of
98% on 50% FM.

Respiratory: once extubated, aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs,
chest PT were continued.   His steroids were tapered off. His
oxygen saturations improved 94%RA.
Subcutaneous emphysema slowly improving.

Chest-tube: persistent air leak continued on water-seal until
improved.  Removed on [**2119-1-18**]. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema
with right apical pneumothorax.  A pigtail was placed on
[**2119-1-20**] to suction with residual small apical pneumothorax. On
[**2119-1-21**] he was placed to water-seal, right apical pneumothorax
stable, clamping trial was done, follow-up chest film showed
possible tiny apical pneumothorax.

Chest film: followed by serial chest films which showed right
apical pneumothorax small right pleural effusion.  His chest
film today showed increased subcutaneous emphysema with
decreased right apical pneumothorax which was stable on further
films.

Cardiac: Sinus tachycardia 110's.  Given his history of
cardiomyopathy cardiology was consulted and recommended
Lopressor 25 mg qid, or 5 mg IV if no bowel function.
Maintain euvolemic, transfuse for HCT < 30.  Restart his
afterload medication enalapril was restarted. Discharged on his
home Toprol XL 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].

GI: bowel function returned,  PPI & bowel regime continued

Renal: diuresed with IV lasix to keep euvolemic, Baseline CRE
1.3-1.6 peak 1.8.  Good urine output.  The foley was removed
[**2119-1-18**] he voided.  He was started on furesomide 40 mg daily to
keep him euvolemic.

ID: Vancomycin and Zosyn was started on [**2119-1-15**] following
bronchoscopy for respiratory distress.  BAL & Sputum were sent
with no growth. Pan culture no growth. The antibiotics were
discontinued once the micros were negative.  His WBC elevated
secondary to steroids.

Pain: APS managed
