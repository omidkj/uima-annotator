History of Present Illness:
(per OMR and the patient's family as he is unable to give
history due to AMS): 83 yo male with DM, COPD, h/o MSSA PNA, CHF
(multiple recent hospitalizations for decompensated CHF), AVR
with restenosis (valve area 1.2 in [**Month (only) **]), recent admission
for new Afib and symptomatic NSVT (no intervention but BB
uptitrated),  found to have worsening O2 status at his rehab.
Patient's daughter went to visit him at reham yesterday and his
02 was 'in the low 80s' on oxygen and he was coughing
(non-productive).  They decided to try to increase his 02 and
wait overnight to see if there was improvement, was given
morphine sulfate x3 but had no improvement so family brought him
to [**Hospital1 18**].  Patient's family notes that he seems more aggitated
and uncomfortable today but otherwise similar mental status with
poor short term memory, waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
.
On review of OMR notes, he has had multiple hospitalizations
over last few months for CHF and pneumonia. He was admitted in
[**9-21**] with L/R sided HF, readmitted in [**11-21**] with weight gain,
SOB, found to be in acute heart failure complicated by new onset
afib at which point he was started on coumadin. TTE at that time
showed EF 45-55%, aortic valve area 1.2, severe [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**], 3+
tricuspid regurg, 2+ pulmonic
regurg. mild diffuse hypokinesis and mild depression of
contractility of L/R ventricle. Admitted again [**2146-12-31**] and
intubated for acute respiratory decompensation [**2-14**] CHF, also
treated for MSSA pneumonia. Admitted [**1-27**] for NSVT and new Afib,
treated with increasing dose of BB.  Patient has also recently
worked up for altered mental status thought most likely [**2-14**]
toxic metabolic.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.9 60 118/45 17 98 on.  Labs
notable for a WBC count of 13.9, HCT 34.4, Cr. 1.7 and troponin
0.10.  BNP pending.  Lactate 1.0., INr 3.3. abg: Ph7.27 pCO2 76
pO2 78 HCO3 36. CXR with large right pleural effusion. Patient
was given Vanco 1g IV, Levofloxacin 750mg, Ceftriaxone, and
Methyprednisone 125.  He was then given aspirin 600 PR.  Cards
was consulted who said it is likely demand due to a large
pleural effusion with someone with known coronary artery
disease.  They did not look at the EKGs. EKG showed v1 and v2 ST
depressions, 1-2 mm.  Vitals currently: 61 120/41 98% on Bipap
[**5-17**] 40%.  DNR/DNI confirmed with patient and his family in the
ED.
.
On the floor, the patient is wearing bipap and appears to be
working hard to breath.  He reports feeling like he can't
breathe.  His family (3 daughters, one of whom is his HCP)
report that he appears uncomfortable and again report that the
patient wants to be DNR/DNI.
.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**], his PCP came in and a family meeting was held with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the MICU resident and the patient's 3 daughters.
The family was updated on the patient's situation and his low
likelihood of recovery without intubation (and very low
likelihood of cure regardless).  All three sisters were in
agreement that the patient was clear that he did not want to be
intubated, they felt that intubation and CPR would cause him
more suffering and felt comfortable with keeping the patient
DNR/DNI.  Plan was to try lasix, antibiotics and Bipap to see if
it was possible to improve the patient's respiratory status but
to also make the patient comfortable with morphine even if this
decreased his respirations.  The sisters requested a catholic
priest for the patient as well as some time to update their
other 5 siblings.

Brief Hospital Course:
As per HPI, a family meeting was held with the patient's family,
the MICU attending, and the patient's primary care physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 4120**] goals of care. He DNR/DNI status was affirmed.
[**Hospital **] medical strategies such as diuresis, antibiotics,
and positive pressure ventilation masks were pursued. The
patient, however, did not tolerate the BiPAP mask and was
clearly uncomfortable, despite morphine boluses. Further
discussions were held with the family, and the patient was
transitioned to comfort measures only status. He was placed on a
morphine drip with PRN ativan available. He passed away
peacefully with his family at his side, shortly thereafter.
