History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year-old female with HTN, DM, CAD s/p VF
arrest with anterior STEMI and LAD stenting in [**4-5**], pacemaker
placement, h/o TIA, who presents from [**Hospital3 **] for
presumed NSTEMI. She has been having intermittent heavy left
sided chest pain radiating to arm, neck and back for a couple
days. She additionally c/o diarrhea for 1 week prior to
presentation in addition to nausea. No fevers or chills. She
notes stopping clopidigrel a week ago. At [**Hospital1 **], she was found
to have a trop of 1.15. EKG was ventricularly paced without new
signs of ischemia. Patient was given ASA 325 mg and stared on
heparin and nitroprusside gtts with improvement in pain from
[**9-9**] to [**3-12**]. She also received zofran 4mg for nausea. She was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 97.6, P 81, BP 186/113, RR 18,
O2sat 99% on 3L O2. Patient is stable with no further complaints
of chest pain. JVD elevated but lungs clear without complaints
of dyspnea on 3L O2. She did complain of nausea and stomach
upset at times. Exam notable for red, hot, and mildly edematous
(nonpitting) RLE without pain; nontender. RLE U/S negative for
DVT. EKG was ventricularly paced with ?LBBB but no ST changes.
Trop here 0.57, CK not sent; Cr 1.2. Anion gap 17. The patient
was continued on Heparin gtt and nitro gtt (titrated down in ED)
and started metoprolol 25 mg po bid. Patient also given zofran
8mg IV. On transfer to floor, vitals were: T 97.8, P 65, BP
140/88, RR 22, O2sat 99% on 3L.
.
On arrival to the floor her initial VS were: , patient currently
feels well, denies any CP, SOB, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Her back pain has improved since getting off the stretcher in
the ER.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Imaging / Procedures:
Cardiac cath: [**2139-3-9**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was free
of angiographically significant disease. There was in stent
restenosis of the proximal LAD to 70%. The remainder of the LAD
was free of angiographically significant disease. A ramus
demonstrated serial 90% stenoses. The Lcx gave rise to a small
OM that was totally occluded and filled late via left to left
collaterals. There was a mid vessel 60% stenosis. There was a
thrombotic occlusion of the distal RCA which was an ectatic
vessel throughout. Left to right collaterals supplied the distal
RCA.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated right
and left heart filling pressures (RA mean 17mmHg, PCW mean
19mmHg). There was severe pulmonay artery hypertension
(PASP=80mmHg PADP=33mmHg PA mean=48mmHg). The cardiac output and
index were low at 3.8L/min and 1.98L/min/m2. The SVR was
elevated at 2147 dynes/sec/cm-5 and PVR severely elevatd at 611
dynes/sec/cm-5.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with culprit vessel for
NSETMI likely RCA thrombosis. Lesion not well suited for PCI so
surgical evaluation recommended.
2. Elevated
