Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
79 YOM with severe cardiomyopathy and heart failure who presents
with dyspnea. His recent medical course details a progressive
decline in his functional status. He was recently admitted wo
the [**Hospital Ward Name **] with SOB and acute on chronic renal failure.
Brought by family to ED today for cough, dyspnea, and increased
lower ext edema. Also noted by PCP to again have acute on
chronic renal failure, lasix dose recently doubled to try to
help control symptoms. Currently resting comfortably. [**Hospital Ward Name 4273**]
chest pain.  Complains of chronic cough productive of white
sputum.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] was noted to be bradycardic down to 20
while asleep and 40s when awake with systolic BPs greater than
90. He was
given levofloxacin 500mg IV for presumed pneumonia prior to CXR
given history of dyspnea and cough. He was also given 1L NS.  Of
note has recently been evaluated by both heart failure and EP
services. Given poor prognosis was felt not to be a candidate
for ICD. His cardiac regimen has going under several changes
including transiently on amiodarone, doubling of Dig to 0.125
mcg.

Family History:

-F:?
-No known liver disease in the family

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 94/60 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 49
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVD to angle of the jaw sighting at ~60 degrees. The carotid
waveform was normal. There was no thyromegaly. The were no chest
wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. The respirations were
not labored and there were no use of accessory muscles. The lung
sounds were decreased at the base bilaterally with dullness to
percussion.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were soft systolic murmur heard
best at LUSB.
.
The abdominal aorta was able to be palpated. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and distended.Marked ascities present. The extremities had edema
bilaterally rising above the knee. There were no abdominal,
femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin
and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers,
scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 1+ DP D PT D
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 1+ DP D PT D


Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated a fib with ventricular escape. Rate 41. LAD.
narrow qrs. No ST changes. TWI in V4. Low voltage in limb leads.

Similar to [**2195-5-25**].
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated:bradycardia
.
CXR: Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray of [**2195-5-25**]. The heart remains markedly enlarged and aortic valve
replacement is present. Tortuosity of the aorta is again seen.
No gross failure is seen. The costophrenic angles appear sharp.
No infiltrates are present.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2195-1-12**] demonstrated:
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
4. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the aortic valve. Trace aortic valve regugitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
9. There is no pericardial effusion
.
MIBI [**12-1**] -
1. Moderate, fixed inferior and inferolateral wall perfusion
defects. 2. Left ventricular enlargement with global hypokinesis

and depressed ejection fraction of 34%

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old male with severe cardiomyopathy (CHF, EF 20-25%),
severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], s/p mechanical AVR in [**2182**], Afib on coumadin,
CRI (baseline 2.2-2.6), cirrhosis/ascites from RH failure, h/o
GI bleed (small bowel AVM), MRSA bacteremia p/w cough, dyspnea,
found to have bradycardia down to 20s in setting of increased
digoxin dose and acute on chronic renal failure.
.
1)Dyspnea - this was likely multifactorial including poor
mechanics from  ascities, bradycardia, bronchitis, heart
failure. He was also a former smoker but did not have a
diagnosis of COPD. He did receive levofloxacin x1 but was
without fever or infiltrate on admission to suggest pneumonia so
antibiotics were stopped.  His INR was 3.5 on admission
therefore PE was unlikely. A lasix drip was started and
metolazone and spironolactone were continued for diuresis. A
dopamine drip was started for improved renal perfusion. The
patient's urine output improved with these interventions and the
lasix drip and dopamine drip were tapered off. He was started on
PO lasix upon discharge.
.
2) Bradycardia - The patient had bradycardia down to 20s on
admission probably in setting of increased BB and increased
digoxin dose and acute on chronic renal failure which may have
decreased clearance. He was given atropine with moderate
response. He is not a candidate for a pacemaker due to his
multiple co-morbidities. His heart rate normalized during his
stay.
.
3) Afib - On coumadin at home. This was held for
super-therapeutic INR. Once his INR was below 3, his coumadin
was restarted (goal INR [**2-28**]).
.
4) Acute on chronic renal failure - Likely secondary to low
intravascular volume in combination with increased diuresis.
However, we continued to diurese the pt. due to his respiratory
distress and volume overload. His creatinine remained stable.
.
5) UTI - E.coli (sensitive to ceftrioxone). Pt. was treated for
his UTI with ceftriaxone.
.
6) Anticoagulation - Mechanical valve and a fib. On coumadin on
admission. INR of 3.5 on admission. When his INR trended down,
coumadin was restarted as above.
.
7) Anemia - Chronic GI blood loss on anticoagulation. He was
transfused 1 unit of pRBC during his stay with appropriate
increase in his Hematocrit.
.
8)FEN - low salt, replete lytes [**Hospital1 **] initially.
.
9) DNR/I
.
10) Dispo - after discussion with the family, a decision was
made for the patient to go home with hospice.
