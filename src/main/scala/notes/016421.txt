renal failure, hypertension presents to the ED from the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with intense diaphoresis and generalized malaise since
earlier this evening.  At the time her blood glucose was 339 but
her temp was 86 F and she was brought to ED.  In the ED, patient
found to be hypothermic (T 32 C), bradycardic (HR 40s), found to
have + UA, and patient began having L-sided chest pain (EKG

of similar episodes in the past few weeks, all of which have
resolved with no clear etiology.  Early in [**Month (only) 547**], she was
admitted and ruled out for MI and PE. Late in [**Month (only) 547**] she was
admitted for neck pain, nausea, diarrhea and was hypoglycemic.

[**6-7**] Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal
anterior septum and anterior wall, and akinesis of the
mid-to-distal anterior wall, anterior septum and inferior
wall... No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate
([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented hypothermic, bradycardic to the emergency
department early morning on [**6-3**].  A femoral line was placed, and
active external rewarming began.  The patient was afebrile but
urinalysis was consistent with a urinary tract infection.  The
patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit because
of concern for sepsis in light of her hypothermia, bradycardia,
and infection picture.
.
The patient was stable in the intensive care unit on 2L oxygen
by nasal cannula.  She had good urine output (greater than
30cc/hr) in response to a 500cc normal saline bolus.  Active
external rewarming was continued, and both temperature and heart
rate rose to normal levels.  The patient's primary care provider
felt that her hypothermia was due to profuse diaphoresis caused
by bethanechol (a cholinergic medication she had taken for
urinary retention).  Plans were made for discharge, but when the
patient became febrile, she was transferred to the general
medical service.   The patient was treated for her urinary tract
infection with ceftriaxone, and the infection resolved.
.
However the morning of [**2117-6-5**] she had an episode of chest pain
and shortness of breath.  Troponin T enzymes returned positive,
indicating cardiac ischemia.  In consultation with cardiology
and the patient, it was determined that the benefits of a
cardiac catheterization would not outweigh the risks in this
79-year-old woman with a number of co-morbidities.  She was
managed medically with increased statin and beta blocker.  She
was also kept on heparin gtt for 48 hours.  Echo demonstrated
and EF of 30% likely [**3-3**] her STEMI.
.
The patient continued to have episodes of chest pain every
morning with shortness of breath.  A CXR demonstrated failure
and she was diuresed with lasix.  A BNP was 24,000.  The patient
repsonds well to 40mg IV.  Her symptoms improved and she will be
sent home on 60mg po lasix [**Month/Day (2) 24018**].  This should be titrated up or
down based on he
