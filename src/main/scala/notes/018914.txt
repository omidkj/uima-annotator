Allergies:
lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath [**2143-7-15**]
cardiac cath [**2143-7-18**]
cardiac biopsy [**2143-7-18**]


History of Present Illness:
69 y/o w/ HTN, CAD (Lcx 99%, 40% mLAD, 40% r PDA), systolic CHF
EF 30-35% w/ significant LVH, recent NSTEMI, presented with
generalized weakness, mild confusion, nausea and vomitting. She
was just discharged from [**Hospital 26580**] hospital where she was admitted
from [**Date range (3) 54882**]. Per obtained discharge summary, she
presented with progressive SOB and LE edema and ruled in for
NSTEMI with trop 0.38, 0.48, 0.98. She subsequently had cardiac
cath completed on [**2143-7-1**] which showed mid LAD 40% stenosis, mid
Lcx 99% unfavorable total occlusion, rPDA 40% stenosis,
pulmonary hypertension, mod-severe MR, depressed LVEF ~45% and
LVH. She then had TEE to better evaluate MR on [**2143-7-2**] which
showed 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 15015**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] hitting back wall with probably mild
mitral stenosis and LVEF 30-35% with dilated atria b/l, elevated
wedge pressure and significant LVH. She was diuresed with lasix
(-10L per patient), and started on metoprolol and losartan. She
was discharged on lasix 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and she reports improvement in
SOB and edema with diuresis throughout hospital stay.
.
Upon discharge home, she was initially feeling well, but then
became weak, more SOB and LE persisted and may have slightly
worsened. No reported weight gain. No PND, +orthopnea (sleeps w/
2 pillows nightly). The morning of admission she became nauseous
and vomitted ~5 times (bilious w/ food non-bloody), was unable
to take POs and thus re-presented to [**Hospital1 46**]. Per her
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3321**], she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac MRI and evaluation for MV repair/replacement.
.
At OSH, she was A&O x3, vitals prior to transfer were afebrile,
HR 74 BP 86/61, 20 99% 4L. Upon arrival to the floor she has
mild SOB and c/o LE edema. Nausea/vomitting much improved. Was
feeling "spacy" earlier, but now feels lucid. Feels generalized
weakness. Denies F/C, HA, vision changes, cough, CP,
palpitations, abd pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria or hematuria.

Pertinent studies:
Cardiac MRI ([**2143-7-8**])-
1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with segmental wall
motion
abnormalities (see above) and mildly reduced systolic function
with the LVEF of 41%. The effective forward LVEF was severely
depressed at 19%. There are multiple areas of hyperenhancement
as described above consistent with myocardial infarction/scar.
2. Moderately to severely increased LV wall thickness.
3. Severely increased LV mass index.
4. Normal right ventricular cavity size with abnormal global
systolic
function. The RVEF was moderately depressed at 23%.
5. Severe mitral regurgitation. There is leaflet tethering
consistent with
"ischemic" (post-infarction) mitral regurgitation.
6. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The indexed diameter of the main
pulmonary artery was mildly enlarged.
7. Mild right and left atrial enlargement.
8. Normal coronary artery origins with no evidence of anomalous
coronary
arteries.
9. A note is made of moderate to severe right pleural effusion
and small left pleural effusion.

CXR ([**2143-7-10**])- Interval increase in a now moderate right effusion
with associated atelectasis. New small left effusion.

Spirometry ([**2143-7-11**])-  Mild restrictive ventilatory defect with a
severe gas exchange defect.  The DLCO is reduced out of
proportion to the reduction in TLC which is consistent with an
interstitial or pulmonary vascular process. The reduced FEV1/SVC
ratio (62.4, 87% of predicted) indicates a coexisting
obstructive ventilatory defect. There are no prior studies
available for comparison.

TEE ([**2143-7-11**])- No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). There is borderline normal free wall function of the
right ventricle. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened with no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal with mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion with no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Dobutamine stress echo ([**2143-7-12**])- Resting images were acquired at
a heart rate of 85 bpm and a blood pressure of 84/60 mmHg. These
demonstrated near-akinesis of the inferior wall with mild
hypokinesis elsewhere (EF 35%). There is a small pericardial
effusion. Doppler demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with no
aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant resting
LVOT gradient. At low dose dobutamine [5mcg/kg/min; hea
