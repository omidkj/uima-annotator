Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
57 y.o. female with hx asthma, CAD, DM II, hypothyroidism,
anxiety/agarophobia and depression, who presented to the ED
today with SOB and agitation. Patient is unable to provide
history as she is intubated at this time. History is obtained
from patient's daughter who does not live with the patient.
According to the patient's daughter the patient has been in her
USOH until a few days ago when she started complaining of SOB
initially relieved with Albuterol inhaler. Daughter reports
speaking with pt on the phone day prior to admission and pt has
not mentioned any complaints to her. Her SOB has been getting
progressively worse and this morning she developed increased WOB
and had to come in to the ED. In the ED, the patient was noted
to have increased WOB and was very agitated. ED initial vitals
98.3 108 207/78 20 100% on NRB and 88% on RAHer lung exam was
described as having bilateraly wheezing and crackles. She was
given nebs, 125 mg of Solumedrol IV, Levofloxacin for presumed
UTI, 5 units of insulin, a total of 3 mg of Ativan and Valium 5
mg for anxiety, and was placed on oxygen. She then was noted to
be somnolent and difficult to arouse. Patient was intubated and
placed on AC 500x15; peep 5; FiO2 100%. ABG was checked
post-intubation and was 7.06/98/374. CXR and CTA done (see
below).
.
Per family, no fevers, chills recently. No cough. No ill
contacts. Bloody stools recorded in ED record. Patient's SO
reports that she ran out of Levothyroxine x 2 wks recently.
.
Of note, the patient was recently seen in PCP's office. Her TSH
was noted to be 9 and Levothyroxine dose was increased. She was
also started on Bactrim for presumed UTI.
.
Called out to floor on [**2158-6-10**] - patient reports that she is
feeling well. SOB is significantly improved, no cough. No chest
pain, abdominal pain. Eating well. Urinating without difficulty
after removal of foley.

GENERAL: intubated, sedated, follows some simple commands, does
not appear to focus

scleral icterus, MM sl dry
NECK: supple, no elevated JVP appreciated

SKIN: maculopapular rash with excoriated papules on abdomen and
arms


Pertinent Results:
EKG: sinus rate 116, ST depressions in V4-V6 and II, III, aVF
(new c/w prior).
.
CXR [**2158-6-8**]:
Persistent bilateral interstitial pattern. This could represent

recurrent interstitial pulmonary edema, but differential
diagnosis includes interstitial infection and a more chronic
interstitial infiltrative process. If there is clinical evidence
of volume overload, initial evaluation with follow up chest
x-rays after diuresis would be suggested. If persistent,
high-resolution CT may be helpful for better characterization if
warranted clinically
.
CTA [**2158-6-8**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Focal opacity seen at the anterior aspect of the left and
right lungs, possibly representing focal area of atelectasis
versus infection.
.
PRIOR STUDIES:
Exercise-MIBI [**12/2157**]: 4.8 Mets Probable reversible defect
involving the basal inferior wall. Moderately depressed left
ventricular function with inferior hypokinesis.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Etiology is not entirely
clear - ? CHF exacerbation and/or asthma causing development of
initial respiratory symptoms, further exacerbated by multiple
doses of benzodiazepines given for anxiety in the ED.  Also has
history of hypothyroidism - abnormal TFTs but no bradycardia,
hypothermia, or other symptoms that suggest myxedema coma. CXR
with interstitial infiltrate vs. pulmonary edema. Patient
required intubation in the ED for respiratory distress.  She was
able to be extubated on hospital day 2 and was transferred to
the floor. Asthma exacerbation was treated with Solu-Medrol and
then was switched to a prednisone taper.  Patient received
albuterol and ipratropium inhalers.  She was also started on
Levofloxacin and Azithromycin empirically to cover for a URI. A
nasopharyngeal aspirate for viral pathogens was negative.
Patient was started on furosemide and diuresed. WBC elevated
during her stay although most likely secondary to steroids - WBC
were WNL on admit, increased after getting Solu-Medrol, and
trended down as steroid dose was decreased. Antibiotics were
discontinued. On discharge patient was continued on albuterol
and ipratropium, a prednisone taper, and furosemide.
.
2. Pleural effusions: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] fevers, chills to
suggest infection. Profound hypothyroidism may results in
pleural effusion but unlikely to be the case here. Most likely
can be attributed to her CHF. ECHO on [**2158-6-9**] with EF of 40 %
(this is unchanged from exercise mibi in [**12-10**] with calculated
EF of 40%). Patient will be discharged on standing furosemide.
She will follow-up with her PCP next week who will repeat her
CXR and adjust her furosemide dose as necessary.  She should
also have her electrolytes checked at that time.
.
3. Anemia: Acute HCT drop from 35.8 on admission to 28. ED chart
has documented blood in stool. Recent colonoscopy negative. No
bowel movements during admission. No obvious source of bleeding.
Gastric lavage was negative. No recent instrumentation to be
concerned about retroperitoneal bleed. Bilateral pneumothoraces
unlikely. HCT stable since admission. Coags WNL. No transfusions
during this admission. Anemia may be related to hypothyroidism
and should be followed up in out-patient setting.
.
4. CAD s/p stents: ST depressions in lateral and inferior leads
on EKG changes. CK slightly elevated, but MB and trop negative.
Patient with recent stress mibi in [**12-10**] and seen by cardiology
in [**4-10**], recommended ongoing medical management. No chest pain
during this admission. Patient was continued on ASA,
atorvastatin, metoprolol and lisinopril.
.
5. UTI: Treated with a course of levofloxacin.
.
6. Hypothyroidism: TSH up to 17 from 9.4 recently. Discussed
with endocrine fellow: no indications for T3 at this time.
Levothyroxine 150 mcg po daily, per endocrine - recheck TFTs in
one month.
.
7. DM: Poorly controlled, was initially on insulin gtt when on
the ICU.  Seen by endocrine who made recommendations for a home
regimen of NPH and a regular insulin sliding scale. Patient was
discharged on NPH and regular insulin.
.
8. Depression/anxiety/psych: Continued on home regimen of Paxil,
Klonopin, and Valium.
