IMPRESSION:
1. Segmental right middle lobe pulmonary artery pulmonary

2. Fluid-filled distal right lower lobe bronchus with associated
atelectasis.
3. Focal ground-glass opacity within the right lower lobe which
could represent either aspiration or early pneumonia.

The right internal jugular line tip is in low SVC. The NG tube
tip is in the stomach. The IVC filter is in expected position.
There is no interim change in the appearance of right middle and
right lower lobe atelectasis. There is unchanged basal
atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Small left pleural effusion
cannot be excluded. The upper lungs are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild-to-moderate interval increase in amount of
intra-abdominal free fluid. A few small pockets of hyperdense
fluid along the anterior abdominal wall adjacent to incisional
site are likely small postoperative hematomas.
2. Interval increase in size to a known invasive pancreatic head
mass. No significant interval change to retroperitoneal/right
nephrectomy mass. Please note, overall examination is limited
due to lack of IV and oral contrast.
3. Interval placement of suprarenal IVC filter.
4. Probable bilateral, right greater than left, basilar
atelectasis with areas of adjacent patchy ground-glass
opacities. Superinfection/aspiration pneumonitis cannot be
excluded.
5. Gastric tube with its tip in the fundus. Nonvisualization of
GJ tube mentioned in history.

Slight interval worsening in bilateral airspace opacities.
Diagnostic considerations again include pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pain: Chronic opioid user for pain, post-operatively the pt had
severe abdominal pain, out of proportion to his abdominal exam,
which remained relatively soft, although distended, throughout
his hospitalization. On POD8, APS was consulted after pain
control could not be achieved using a fentanyl gtt at
300mcg/hour, dilaudid
PCA@0.75mg/q6mins, clonidine patch in the ICU.  APS transitioned
the pt to a ketamine infusion at 10-15mg/h, with dilaudid PCA
and clonidine patch.  Before discharge the patient was
transitioned to a PO regimen that included methadone 20mg tid,
dilaudid 8-10mg q3h prn, and clonidine and fentanyl patches. On
discharge the pain was well-controlled.

PE: On POD3, the pt developed acute dyspnea with tachypnea,
requiring non-rebreather and CPAP to maintain adequate
oxygenation.  He was transferred to the SICU, where his
respiratory failure could be appropriately managed.  Once
stabilized, a PE protocol CTA was done and demonstrated a
segmental right middle lobe pulmonary artery pulmonary embolus.
The pt was started on a sub-therapeutic heparin drip (goal PTT
50-60) and vascular surgery was consulted to put in a
supra-renal IVC filter, which they did on POD4.  On POD5, PPD1,
a flex bronch with therapeutic aspiration was done with much
improvement in the pt's respiratory status.  By POD8, the pt's
respiratory status had improved and the pt was transferred to
the floor.  Supplemental oxygen was weaned, and on discharge the
pt did not require any supplemental oxygen.  The heparin drip
was discontinued on POD15, and he was discharged without any
anticoagulation due to the risk of bleeding from the pancreatic
tumor.

Elevated glucose: Throughout his hospitalization, the pt had
elevated blood glucose measurements between 100-200mg/dl.  The
pt was discharged without insulin, but it was recommended that
he follow up the week of discharge with his primary care
physician for management of this issue.

ID: Intraoperatively, there was some stool spillage into the
abdomen so the pt was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.
After spiking a fever on POD___, antibiotics were changed to
vancomycin and zosyn.  The pt was pan-cultured, and blood and
urine
