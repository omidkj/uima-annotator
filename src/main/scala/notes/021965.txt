CT Scan:
TORSO [**2153-2-28**] IMPRESSION:
1. Status post esophagectomy, with no evidence of contrast
extravasation.
2. Interval placement of two additional right-sided chest tubes,
with
decreased lateral right pleural fluid. Minimally increased
pleural fluid at the right base, with two foci of gas, likely
related to the chest tube.  Decreased left pleural fluid.
3. Decreased right lung consolidation. Interval resolution of
right
pneumothorax.
TORSO [**2153-2-18**] IMPRESSION:
1. Status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through, with no
evidence of
leak, allowing for lack of contrast opacification at the level
of the
anastomosis.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, and gas and fluid tracking
in the right lateral chest wall.
3. Mostly dependent consolidation in the right lung, although
infection
cannot be fully excluded. Dependent consolidation at the left
lung base
likely represents atelectasis. Small right pneumothorax.
4. Submucosal fat perforation in the rectum and sigmoid colon,
consistent
with chronic inflammation. Correlate with history of
inflammatory bowel
disease.
Esophagus: [**2153-2-27**]:
1. Patent esophagogastric anastomosis with no evidence of leak.
2. 20-minute delayed imaging reveals no passage of contrast into
the
duodenum. Gastric emptying can be evaluated with a delayed
image.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86762**] was admitted on [**2153-2-14**] for an Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **]
esophagectomy, buttressing of esophagogastric anastomosis with
intercostal muscle, laparoscopic jejunostomy, and
esophagogastroduodenoscopy. He tolerated the procedure well. He
was transferred to the SICU intubated.  He was successfully
extubated on [**2153-2-15**]. However during this period, the patient
became more agitated and tachycardic. Chest tube output changed
in color from serosanginous to black fluid. He then underwent an
EGD which showed some ischemic changes proximal to the
anastamosis. When the conduit was insufflated with air, there
was a leak seen on his chest tubes thereby confirmed the leak.
He was taken back to the OR on [**2-20**] for decortication, revising
the anstamosis, and pleural tent buttressing.

Neuro: After extubation, the patient was transitioned to Roxicet
liquid via his J-tube.  His pain was well controlled and he
reported minimal pain.

Respiratory: Aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs and chest PT were
performed. He weaned off supplemental oxygen to room air with
oxygen saturations of 96%.

Bronchscopy was done on [**2153-2-21**] BAL.

Tubes & Drains: R anterior apical CT and R basilar CT were d/c'd
on POD9 with sufficiently low output. The JP drain at the
anastamosis site was removed on [**2153-3-2**]

PICC: Single Lumen Left Cephalic 45 cm terminates in the mid SVC
place [**2153-3-1**]

Cardiac:  Remained in sinus rhythm on beta-blockers and was
hemodyanmically stable during the inpatient admission.

GI: NG tube was removed by the patient on POD2 following the
second procedure.  A barium swallow was performed on POD5
without leak.

Nutrition: He was seen by nutrition who recommended Nutren
Pulmonary Full strength; Beneprotein, 35 gm/day  Goal rate:75
ml/hr Cycle start:1500 Cycle end:0700
Tube feeds were started on POD1 and titrated to goal without
difficulty.  He was started on a clear liquid diet advanced to
soft solid on [**2153
