IMAGING:
MRI head [**2123-12-9**]:
1. Leptomeningeal enhancement along pons and cerebellum
suggestive of meningeal inflammation/infection. This is a
non-specific finding and correlate with CSF analyses results for
further assessment.
2. Parenchymal volume loss which may be related to the patient's
underlying HIV or alcohol use. T2 and FLAIR hyperintense white
matter foci are a nonspecific finding.

MRI spine [**2123-12-9**]:
1. Endplate destruction with near obliteration of the
intervertebral disc
space at L4-5, which may represent the sequela of prior
infection given the patient's history. There are no findings
specific for ongoing infection at this time, with no evidence of
surrounding edema, enhancement, or evidence of epidural
involvement.

2. No evidence of spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing in
the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine. Linear enhancement
along the ventral aspect of the cord likely represents a vessel,
but is difficult to fully characterize given the large field of
view and decreased resolution.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL; DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL: [**2123-12-10**]
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
this study.
2. Normal liver Doppler. Small cyst in the left liver lobe.
3. Cholelithiasis and sludge within the gallbladder, with mild
wall
thickening of the gallbladder wall, an unchanged finding that
could suggest HIV cholangiopathy or relate to chronic liver
disease.
4. Small amount of ascites.
5. Multiple calcifications in the pancreas in keeping with
chronic
pancreatitis.

MRI ([**2123-12-28**])-
IMPRESSION:

1. New acute infarcts in the cerebellar hemispheres on both
sides, the right middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior
cerebellar peduncle with mildly increased enhancement on the
surface of the pons and the right temporal lobe, related to
leptomeningeal enhancement.

RUQ ([**2123-12-28**])-
IMPRESSION:
1. Coarsened hepatic architecture with no focal solid mass
identified.
Unchanged small left hepatic cyst.
2. Trace of ascites in the perihepatic space, but no pocket
suitable for
paracentesis could be located in the lower quadrants.
3. Patent hepatic vasculature.
