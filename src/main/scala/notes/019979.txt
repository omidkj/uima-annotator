Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 68 yo M w/PMHx sx for multiple myeloma
(diagnosed [**2-23**]), s/p CVA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, atrial
fibrillation who presents with respiratory distress, initially
presenting with 3 days of cough with sputum production with
fevers to 103 to [**Hospital6 **]. His vital signs in their ED
were 103.2 BP 209/94 HR 99 100% CPAP. At [**Hospital3 **], he was felt
to be in pulmonary edema and he received lasix 40 mg IV and was
started on a nitro gtt for BPs 200s/130s, and was given
ceftriaxone and azithromycin and then given levofloxacin and
vancomycin in our ED.

.

Per report, patient w/O2sat 92% RA on NRB, and was intubated in
our ED. No ABG was checked. Patient had a CXR at the time which
showed with RML collapse, which was attributed to pneumonia.

.

Patient was recently admitted from [**2-23**] to [**3-1**] with fevers,
hypercalcemia, and acute [**Month/Day (1) **] failure concerning for
progression of his MGUS to multiple myeloma, with confirmatory
BM biopsy performed. During that admission, he had an episode of
AF with RVR, with an echo showing atrial dilatation.


Past Medical History:
* Multiple myeloma, with acute [**Month/Day (1) **] failure and hypercalcemia.
-BM biopsy: Plasma cells comprise 53% of aspirate differential
and  80-90% of bone marrow cellularity by CD138 staining of the
core biopsy c/w plasma cell myeloma
-Hypercalcemia
-Anemia
-Acute [**Month/Day (1) **] failure

* Right PICA stroke, inferior medial stroke in [**2123-5-26**]. MRI
showed occluded right vertebral artery. Echo with complex
atheroma. He has been placed on Coumadin and then switched to
aspirin, and Plavix.

* Hypertension.

* Hypercholesterolemia

* Anemia, B12 and iron deficiency.

* Colon polyp

* Anemia


Social History:
Patient is Cuban, moved to [**Location (un) 86**] 42 years ago, lives with his

IMAGING

CT head [**3-19**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or bleed.
The extra- axial collections mentioned on the prior CT are
either prominent CSF spaces secondary to atrophy, or less likely
hygromas.

CXR [**3-4**]
The right lung opacity has slightly worsened in the interim as
well as there is interval development of new left predominantly
perihilar but also lower lobe opacity, findings consistent with
superimposed pulmonary edema in addition to known multifocal
parenchymal consolidations. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. A small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Note
is made that left cardiophrenic angle was not included in the
field of view.
The ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in
the stomach.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of volume overload in addition
to multifocal consolidations.

Non-Contrast Head CT [**2129-3-15**]:
1.  No evidence for hemorrhage.
2.  Evidence for chronic small vessel microischemic changes is
stable.
3.  Extensive sinus disease within the frontal, maxillary and
sphenoid sinuses as well as the mastoid air cells.  Acute
sinusitis cannot be excluded and clinical correlation is
recommended, especially in a patient who has been recently
extubated.
4.  Low density bifrontal fluid collections may represent
prominent extra-
axial CSF spaces in a patient with age-related atrophy versus
subdural
hygromas.  These are slightly more prominent than on the prior
examination.

Echocardiography [**2129-3-7**]:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-2-24**],
the findings are similar.

[**Year (4 digits) 2793**] Ultrasound [**2129-3-5**]:
Limited [**Month/Day/Year **] ultrasound performed portably in the ICU.  No
hydronephrosis detected.  [**Month/Day/Year 2793**] cortical appearance similar to
that of recent comparison 10 days previous with mild thinning of
the cortex and
echogenicity consistent with chronic [**Month/Day/Year **] insufficiency.

Abdominal X-ray [**2129-3-6**]:
Dilated loops of small bowel.  Partial vs. early complete
obstruction or ileus is not excluded.  No definite evidence of
free air however assessment for free air is limited on this
single supine radiograph.
Followup decubitus films are recommended.

[**2129-3-15**]:
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head.
COMPARISON: [**2129-3-15**].
FINDINGS: There is no short interval change from [**2127-3-16**]. There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of
normally midline structures. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci
are unremarkable aside from mildly enlarged bifrontal CSF spaces
secondary to mild brain atrophy. Mild periventricular white
matter hypodensities are the sequelae of chronic small vessel
infarction, and note is made of a right lacunar infarct. The
osseous structures are unremarkable and the visualized paranasal
sinuses again demonstrate near complete opacificati
