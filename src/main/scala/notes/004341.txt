Brief Hospital Course:
1. UTI, urosepsis - The patient was treated empirically with
vancomycin and ceftriaxone in the emergency department. Upon
arrival to the floor, she was hypotensive to the 80's systolic.
She was subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care
unit for close monitoring and did well hemodynamically with
fluid support, without any pressor requirement. Her antibiotics
were changed to Zosyn, and she showed a good clinical response
and improvement in her leukocytosis. On the floor, she was
transistioned to PO ciprofloxacin which she will complete for a
14d course, to end on [**7-2**].
.
2. Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine improved
follow IVF rehydration. Her renal failure was thought to be
pre-renal in etiology. She will hold off on Avapro until her
follow-up appointment with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] repeat Bun/Cr will be
measured the week following discharge.
.
2. CAD - The patient continued aspirin and her statin.
.
4. Dementia - She continued aricept for her dementia.
.
5. Hypertension - Her anti-hypertensives were initially held in
