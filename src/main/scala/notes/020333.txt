Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and mechanically
ventialted.
[**2117-2-19**] - Extubation and discontinuation of mechanical
ventilation
[**2117-2-18**] - Bedside bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year-old Female with oxygen-dependent COPD, CAD,
diastolic CHF, mitral stenosis, IDDM, HTN, HLD who presented to
an [**Hospital6 7472**] ED on [**2117-2-10**] with acute hypoxic
respiratory failure with oxygen saturations in the 81-85% on 2L
NC and hypotension.
.
Her partner states that she had been feeling unwell for several
days prior to this with fatigue, chills, one an episode of
non-bloody emesis, "indigestion," decreased urine output, and
back pain. She had completed a course of antibiotics and
Prednisone as an outpatient earlier this month for presumed
pneumonia.
.
In the OSH ED, she was found to have acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 1.9 (baseline 0.6). A CXR showed a right lower
lobe infiltrate. Given her recent hospitalization 1-month prior,
she was started on atypical coverage with Azithromycin as well
as HCAP PNA coverage with Vancomycin and Zosyn. Her previous
hospital course was complicated by an episode of hypercarbic
respiratory failure requiring intubation, and she was intubated
on [**2-13**] prior to bronchoscopy. She underwent a fiber-optic
bronchscopy on [**2-13**] which showed clear tenacious secretions in
the left mainstem, persistent bronchomalacia of the left
mainsten, a stenosis of right middle lobe oriface. Biopsies
showed acute inflammation and revealed no malignancy.
.
The patient was extubated to BiPAP following her bronchoscopy.
She had an asystolic event with CPR and ROSC on [**2-14**] thought to
be due to mucous plugging, resulting in re-intubation ([**2117-2-14**]).
Of note, the patient has had a similar event on a prior
hospitalization. The etiology of this event was thought to be
pulmonary in origin.
.
She also underwent CT abdominal imaging on [**2117-2-10**] given her
back pain complaints on admission and known cardiovascular
disease, which showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and a
left adrenal adenoma without AAA. CT chest imaging showed no
pulmonary embolism, no aortic dissection, but was notable for
bilateral pleural effusions. There was high grade stenosis at
the level of the SMA.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-2-17**] for involvement of
interventional pulmonology given her bronchiomalacia and
cardiology consult for her worsening mitral stenosis, and
further work-up of of her renal failure.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and sedated
with Fentanyl and Versed. Patient has received intermittent IV
Lasix dosing with adequate diuresis. A 2D-Echo demonstrated
severe mitral annular calcification with mild stenosis and
regurgitation, moderate to severe pulmonary HTN (PASP 58 mmHg)
with a preserved LVEF of 55%. A bronchoscopy was performed on
[**2117-2-18**] showing COPD, accessory cardiac bronchus, no focal
stenosis. BAL showed 3+ PMNs, 1+ GPCs in pairs and clusters with
commensal respiratory flora speciated. Her antibiotic coverage
was focused to IV Vanc and she was maintained on Prednisone 40
mg PO daily. She was successfully extubated on [**2117-2-19**]. Cardiac
biomakers revealed a mild Troponin leak with flat CK-MBs. She
received Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer and has been -5.7L
for length-of-stay fluid balance. Of note, has intermittent
episodes of discomfort, anxiety and bronchospasm with a history
of mucus plugging. Prior to transfer, she was weaned from high
flow oxygen fask mask to 3-4L NC.
.
On transfer to the floor, the patient appears fatigued but
comfortable and is speaking in short sentences.

calcification with LAE; last 2D-Echo [**2117-2-19**], MV gradient 8 mmHg,
1+ MR, functional MS)

mitral stenosis, diastolic dysfunction)
