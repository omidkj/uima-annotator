History of Present Illness:
49M with HBV, HCV and ESRD [**1-11**] HIV on dialysis for 25 years
presents with purulent drainage from around the peritoneal
dialysis catheter with an exposed cuff.  He dialyzes himself at
home and follows up at [**Hospital 4029**] Clinic sporadically.  He presented
to [**Hospital 4029**] Clinic today and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for the exposed
catheter cuff and exit site infection.  The peritoneal dialysis
catheter is working and he reports clear output.

The patient denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea. He does not recall last bowel movement. He
reports decreased appetite and weight loss but unsure how much.
He was dialyzed last night.

The patient is a very poor historian.  There is a note in his
paperwork from [**Last Name (un) 4029**] that he was admitted to [**Hospital1 336**] from [**2197-5-4**]
to [**2197-5-9**] but it does not state why.  The patient reports that
it was for infection of his peritoneal dialysis catheter and he
was treated with antiobiotics.

On initial evaluation in the ED, the patient was reportedly very
somnolent and unresponsive to sternal rub but then aroused
without intervention and was able to answer questions.  CD4
count was 273 2 years ago and the patient is reportedly
non-compliant with his medications.

Past Medical History:
* HIV
- diagnosed HIV+ in [**2178**] while he was in Guantanamo Bay.  He
received political asylum.  He feels his HIV infection was the
result of receipt of blood transfusions as a result of injuries
sustained while being interrogated in a jail in [**Country 2045**]. He
sustained several gunshot
wounds and lacerations, as well as blunt trauma. He reported
having CMV retinitis of the R eye that was diagnosed in [**2186**]. It
was treated with a ganciclovir implant, but was further
complicated by chronic pain that resulted in enucleation.  He
also had a work up for a pulmonary nodule in [**2178**], that
ultimately was felt to be consistent with latent TB infection,
and he was treated with 6 months of INH therapy in one report,
up to a year in another.  He also had pneumococcal sepsis in
[**2185**]."
* Hepatitis B
* Venous thromboembolism
* Depressive disorder & anxiety
* CMV infection
* History of tuberculosis
* chronic kidney disease stage V due to HIV, on peritoneal
dialysis, followed at [**Last Name (un) 4029**] in [**Location (un) **] on [**State **] St.
* Chronic constipation
* h/o XRT at MEEI for SCC in his left ear
* Hypertension
* Syphilis [**Month (only) **] l993 c/b neurosyphilis, treated with IV
penicillin x10days
* Hepatitis C antibody positive
* s/p PD catheter placement [**2190**], numerous HD catheters and AV
fistulas; all failed

IMAGING
-------
Chest X-ray on admission: IMPRESSION: Right perihilar hazy
opacity which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but
infection also is in the differential. Small bilateral pleural
effusions. Limited evaluation of the right lung apex.
.
CT head on admission:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Near-complete opacification of the bilateral mastoid air
cells, unchanged on the left, but new on the right.
3. Increased size and number of lucencies within the calvaria
should be
correlated clinically with any history of malignancy, and a bone
scan can be obtained for further evaluation. This finding was
communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4033**] at 12:20 a.m. via
telephone on [**2197-5-17**].
4. Extensive paranasal sinus disease, as described above.
5. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease, not
significantly changed compared to [**2195-3-11**].
.
CXR [**2197-5-18**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increased
parenchymal opacity in the right perihilar lung areas. Although
unilateral pulmonary edema would be more likely than pneumonia,
pneumonia cannot be excluded on grounds of the radiologic
appearance.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged
vascular stent.

count 273 in [**2194**], in-house level 52), HBV coinfection and a
