Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2112-4-28**] where
the patient underwent AVR (21mm mechanical), MVR (27mm mech),
TVrepair (28mm ring), CABG x 1 (LIMA-LAD) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
is in chronic AFib, coumadin was resumed for this as well as the
new mechanical valves.  She was bridged with heparin.   The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  INR
became therapeutic and Heparin was discontinued.  By the time of
discharge on POD 6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to [**Hospital 12414**] Health Care in [**Location (un) 12415**] in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
