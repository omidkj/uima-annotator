Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of hypertension, possible CAD,
hyperthryoid who presents with high degree AV block.  Signs and
symptoms thought to be secondary to the conduction abnormalities
were renal failure and altered mental status.

The Mobitz type II (intially 4:1 and then 2:1) heart block was
intially adressed with the emergent placement of a temporary
pacemaker via the right interenal jugular vein.  This resulted
in improved heart rate and resolution of the patient's renal
failure and altered mental status.

The patient was febrile which delayed the placement of a
permanent pacemaker.  A source for the fever was never found.
She was treated for a 7 day course with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.   The permanent pacemaker was placed on [**8-1**]/0

An echo was obtained to help evaluate the patient's pump
function, which was remarkably prsereved.

The patient's thyroid function was checked and her tsh was WNL.


She was discharged to her extended care facilitiy with follow up
scheduled with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] and Device Clinic.
