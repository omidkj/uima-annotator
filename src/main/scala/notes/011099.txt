Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Pacemaker erythema


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-10-29**] - Removal of infected pacemaker defibrillator, attempted
removal of pacing leads.
[**2132-10-30**] - Repair of left common femoral artery and repair of
left common femoral vein.
[**2132-10-30**] - 1. Removal of infected pacemaker leads by median
sternotomy.
2. Repair of laceration to the superior vena cava and innominate
vein with bovine pericardial patch.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 35 year old male with PMH significant for hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, complete heart
block, ASD (repaired in [**2093**]), multiple pacemaker surgeries,
s/p AICD revision on [**2132-9-24**] here at [**Hospital1 18**] admitted [**2132-10-21**] for
infection at the pacemaker site.   An ultrasound of the
pacemaker pocket revealed a small rim of fluid. However, it
was decided that the risk of seeding the pacemaker site by
placing a needle through the overlying cellulitis to drain the
fluid outweighed the benefits.  Therefore, a left sided PICC was
placed [**10-23**] and the patient was discharged to hotel on [**2132-10-24**]
with VNA services to administer vancomycin 1500mg IV twice
daily.  Patient presented to holding area on [**10-28**] to follow up
with cardiologist an decision made to
explant hardware.

Pertinent Results:
[**2132-10-30**] ECHO
PRE CPB
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
XX %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.

POST CPB:
Unchanged RV systolic function (Still severely depressed).
Unchanged LV systolic function.(EF 15-20%) (On Epinephrine and
milrinone)
TR is now mild
No other change

[**2132-10-30**] CT Scan
1. Thrombus identified within the left internal jugular vein.
The right
internal jugular vein remains patent, although please note that
ultrasound is more sensitive.
2. Extensive fat stranding and lymph nodes within the left
supraclavicular
area. ICD wires are identified traversing this area and entering
the SVC.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The heterogeneous density in the
left jugular vein may be contrast mixing, rather than clot. The
junction of the left jugular with the SVC is poorly seen, and no
opacification is seen surrounding the ICD leads. Although poorly
visualized, this may indicate thrombosis along this segment. The
right jugular and subclavian veins appear patent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80943**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-10-29**] for removal of
an infected pacer lead and pacer pocket. Vancomycin was
continued per the infectious disease service for the infection.
He was taken to the operating room where he underwent removal of
the infected pacemaker defibrillator and attempted removal of
pacing leads. The leads were unable to be removed. He returned
to the operating room on [**2132-10-30**] and underwent removal of
infected pacemaker leads through a median sternotomy on CPB
(groin cannulation).  He required repair of the superior vena
cava and innominate vein with bovine pericardial patch. The
vascular surgery service was consulted intraoperatively for
repair of the left common femoral artery and left common femoral
vein due to the urgent femoral cannulation. Please refer to
operative note for further surgical details. Postoperatively he
was taken to the CVICU. He required high doses of several
pressors (epi 0.3, vasopressin 3.6, levophed, milrinone) to
maintain an adequate blood pressure/hemodynamics. He began to
spike fevers to 104 and showing signs of septic shock.
Vancomycin was continued and zosyn was added. ID continued to
follow postoperatively with recommendations for antibiotics. His
