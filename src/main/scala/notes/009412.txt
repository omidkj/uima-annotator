ORGANISMS/ML..

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2171-4-16**] 5:55 AM:  There is stable
cardiomegaly. The aorta is tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar
contours are stable. Pulmonary vasculature is prominent. There
is peribronchial cuffing and increased bilateral interstitial
markings. The moderate left pleural effusion appears increased
compared to prior exam as does the small right pleural effusion.
There appears to be a minimally displaced lower left rib
fracture. It is unclear if this was present previously. Osseous
structures are otherwise stable. Right IJ tunneled dialysis
catheter is again noted.

IMPRESSION: CHF. Increase in bilateral pleural effusions, larger
on the left. Left lower rib fracture, age indeterminant.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2171-4-17**] 4:21 PM: 1 Gynecomastia.  2.
Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than right.  3.
Adjacent atelectasis or consolidation of much of the left lower
lobe, with patchy atelectasis at the right base.  4 No evidence
of pulmonary embolism. 5 Congestive heart failure.

TTE [**2171-4-17**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.    The basal inferolateral wall contracts best. The
remaining segments are near akinetic with mild apical
dyskinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary  artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is a  very prominent
left pleural effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2170-8-10**], the
anterior
septum is now severely hypokinetic and global systolic function
is more
depressed. No 2D echo evidence of endocarditis identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Fever, hypotension: He was felt to have an infection given
the fever and hypotension at presetation. The most likely source
was the recently placed line versus a urinary tract infection.
In the MICU he got multiple antibiotics and was put on levophed
which was weaned to off on [**4-17**]. Three sets of blood cultures
were positive for MRSA. His urine culture grew only yeast with
10-100k cfu consistent with previous, fungal colonization.  His
dialysis line was pulled and he was afebrile after that point in
the MICU. He was transferred to the medical floor for antibiotic
therapy.  New HD access was placed [**2171-4-23**] without
complication.

Vancomycin IV should be continued for a total of 14 days until
[**2171-4-30**].

2) Pleural effusion: He was noted to be hypoxic and have
bilateral pleural effusions. A CTA showed no pulmonary embolus
but did reveal the extent of the effusions and some atelectasis
on the left side. The left sided pleural effusion was tapped.
Chemistries, cytology currently pending. The cell count could
not be done due to a lab error.

3) Funguria - The patient had persistent urine contamination
with yeast. ID was curbsided and sugested that fluconazole
likely would not treat the combination of C glabrata and
albicans, but could be attempted if the UA were positive for LE
and WBC's. They said they would recommend aga
