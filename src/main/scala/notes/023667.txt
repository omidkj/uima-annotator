History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 8840**] is a 46 year-old man with a history of complex pelvic
fracture and ruptured bladder after an MVA, who presents with
fever/sepsis.
.
Recently admitted ([**4-19**] - [**4-21**]) after a 56 day hospitalization
in [**State 4565**] following an MVA complicated by open book pelvic
fracture and right T12-L5 transverse process fracture. While in
[**State 4565**], he had a cystogram and CT cystogram that showed
extraperitoneal bladder rupter to bladder neck (repaired by a
suprapubic tube). That stay was complicated by ARDS requiring
intubation. Following extubation, he developed a soft tissue
infection of his perineum involving his scrotum with subsequent
debridement and exploration for a necrotizing infection,
followed by ex-lap with diverting sigmoid colonostomy.
.
Since discharge to [**Location (un) 38**], he has been feeling improved. He
remains non-weight bearing on his right hip and has had
resulting lower extremity weakness.
.
Seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-3**]; the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed
at this appointment. Seen by urology on [**5-4**], after having
failed a clamping of the suprapubic tube due to penile pain. Per
Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 825**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note, the SPT was unable to be extracted, felt
to be due ot calcificatoins of the balloon.
.
On the day prior to admission, he underwent OR replacement of
his SPT by urology. The tube was clamped at that time. On the
morning of admission, he started having shaking chills at rehab
and was febrile to 104. Also noted nausea and increasing dysuria
(has mild urethral dysuria at baseline). After placing foley he
reports that the pain worsened. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ER.
.
In the ED, initial vitals included T 102.8, HR 116, BP 141/80.
He was treated with vancomycin IV and zosyn IV. For pain,
morphine, then dilaudid were given. After his BP dropped to the
80s, a CVL was placed.
.
At the time of arrival to the MICU, he was feeling signicantly
better.

Pertinent Results:
LABS ON ADMISSION:

.
[**5-18**] CT ab/pelvis w/ contrast
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear. Cardiac apex
is
unremarkable. The stomach, proximal small bowel, adrenal glands,
pancreas,
spleen, gallbladder, liver are unremarkable. Small hypodensity
at the upper
pole of the left kidney (2:21) is too small to characterize. The
kidneys are
otherwise unremarkable. Note is made of an infrarenal IVC
filter. There is no
retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. A linear
hyperdensity at the
midline ventral abdominal wall (2:30) most likely represents
suture material
or post-op calcification.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: A suprapubic catheter is positioned
with its tip in
the bladder. The urinary bladder and distal ureters are
unremarkable. Post-
surgical defects of the scrotum are noted. There is no
subcutaneous gas. There
is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Along the lower pelvic
anterior wall
just above the level of the pubic symphysus, there is
heterogeneous
soft tissue thickening along. In the same area is a 28 x 17mm
fluid collection
(300b:34), ?? seroma versus abscess.

There is a left lower quadrant diverting colostomy with mucus
fistula. The
rectum contains a small amount of barium. The appendix is
normal. Steak
artifact from pelvic hardware limits evaluuation at the
symphysis pubis.

OSSEOUS FINDINGS: Patient is status post ORIF of a diastasis of
the symphysis
pubis and surgical hardware appears in appropriate position. A
fixation screw
also transverses both sacroiliac joints, also appearing in
appropriate
position. Old fracture of the left femoral head is unchanged.
There is new
lucency at the posterior aspect of the left femoral head with
adjacent soft
tissue calcification (2:83). The cortex of bone is ill-defined
in this region,
raising concern for osteomyelitis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive post-surgical changes following scrotal debridement
without
definite evidence of Fournier gangrene. Heterogeneous thickening
along the
lower anterior pelvic wall with small seroma versus small
abscess. Evaluation
limited due to streak artifact from ORIF hardware.
2. Osseous lucency at the left posterior femoral head. Findings
are worrisome
for osteomyelitis. Recommend clinical correlation.
3. Status post diverting colostomy with mucus fistula.
4. Old pelvic fractures s/p ORIF, left femoral head fracture,
old right
lumbar transverse process fractures.
.
[**5-18**] CXR
FINDINGS: Frontal view of the chest is obtained. Right IJ
central venous
catheter is seen with its tip in the expected region of the SVC.
Lungs are
clear bilaterally without evidence of consolidation or
pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Bony structures appear
intact. The
very upper portion of the IVC filter is noted at the lower edge
of the film.

IMPRESSION: Right IJ central venous catheter in appropriate
position. No
pneumothorax.
