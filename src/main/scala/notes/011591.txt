Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Trouble swallowing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Evacuation of cervical hematoma by ENT
Penrose drain placement and removal
PICC line placement and removal

History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 y/o M with history of recent DVT s/p IVC filter,
s/p ACD (anterior cervical discectomy) on [**2179-3-7**], who was
admitted with prevertebral hematoma that was evacuated by ENT on
[**2179-3-13**], hospital course complicated by pneumonia.

The patient intially was planned to have ACD for cervical
stenosis. He was diagnosed with a DVT pre-op, and had an IVC
filter placed on [**2179-3-6**], then had the ACD on [**2179-3-7**]. He
tolerated this procedure well, and was discharged to rehab on
[**2179-3-9**] on heparin gtt for his DVT with no clear long term plan
for anticoagulation. At rehab, he developed right sided neck
swelling and difficulty breathing. He was brought back to the ER
on [**2179-3-13**] and was diagnosed with a prevertebral hematoma. He
had a evacuation of hematoma done by ENT that day. He did fine
postop and was extubated, but then on [**3-14**] he became hypoxic,
had increased size of the wound and cough. ENT inserted penrose
drain at bedside and evacuated 30cc of blood as well as a venous
clot and he was transferred to the SICU (from [**Date range (1) 84712**]). He was
febrile to 102. He was started on Ancefx1 day in the setting of
the penrose placed at bedside. He continued to require 4L NC to
maintain sat >94%. On [**2179-3-16**] he had a chest CT to r/o PE, see
below. He was scoped by ENT that day that showed no obvious
upper airway cause of hypoxia. The CT scan was notable for
several nonocclusive acute/subacute subsegmental emboli and also
showed multifocal pneumonia. He was started on vanc/levaquin on
[**2179-3-17**] in the AM. He was changed to vanc/zosyn for coverage of
hospital acquired pneumonia on [**2179-3-18**], and is on standing
nebulizers. On [**2179-3-19**], he began to complain of L. sided chest
pain which lasted 20 minutes. There was evidence of an ECG with
RBBB which was present on EKG of his last admit, but absent
before. He denies current chest pain.
An ABG on [**2179-3-19**] showed pH 7.48 pCO2 46 pO2 44 HCO3 35 off of
oxygen. He has no history of known lung disease, has never
smoked, and has had no respiratory problems before.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had a presyncopal episode on [**2179-3-23**], with hypotension
to 80/40s and drop in O2Sats to high 70s, one hour after walking
to restroom. Patient had a similar episode on the floor the
night before. Patient placed on non-rebreather and O2Sat
returned to 96% on Non-Rebreather. Trigger called, and patient
ABG showed evidence of hypoxia: pH 7.48 pCO2 46 pO2 43 HCO3 35.
CXR normal. Patient transferred to ICU for closer monitoring of
O2 Sat and non-rebreather oxygenation.
In MICU, patient had CT of chest and abdomen which showed
improvement in his multifocal pna as well as extension of DVT to
IVC filter. Additionally, Neurosurgery was reconsulted in
regards to his ongoing weakness. They believed this was
consistent with contusion from his prior cord compression. No
neurosurgery indicated. Symptoms may not improve with time. As
oxygenation improved to 92-96% 2L nasal cannula, patient was
transferred back to the floor for further evaluation.

Patient reports that he has been feeling short of breath since
the hematoma developed on his neck. His recent episode of
dyspnea began 5 days prior to initial admission to medicine. He
reports mild dyspnea at rest, and worsening shortness of breath
with any type of exertion, including standing to shave.

Of note, patient has experienced significant R. sided weakeness
since [**2178-11-29**]. Weakness was noted after H1N1 infection,
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] work up was negative at OSH. Now he associates
his symptoms temporally with a work injury in which he was
reaching and felt pain in his cervical spine. While on the
medicine floor, patient began to have more progressive weakness
and numbness of the anterior thigh.

Past Medical History:
Chronic LBP with prior surgeries including instrumented fusion
Multiple neck surgeries in the distant past
Hypertension
IVC filter placed [**2179-3-6**] for DVT
Discectomy x2 for herniated disc with cord compression

Social History:
Denies smoking or drinking. Works in plumming. Lives in [**Location **],
is widowed and has daughter. [**Name (NI) **] a significant other. Pt would
like cousin, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 107098**], to speak for him with regards to
medical decisions if he cannot speak for himself.
