small right pleural effusion is seen. A right-sided mediastinal
drain is seen.

of normal caliber. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
kidneys are normal in appearance. No enlarged retroperitoneal or
mesenteric lymph nodes are seen.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon,
prostate, and bladder are normal in appearance. There is no free
air or free fluid in the pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

Finding of portal vein occlusion discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61213**] on
[**2126-6-24**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt s/p liver transplant on [**6-15**]/6. Patients liver was adherent to
diaphragm. Chest tube was placed post-operatively, and removed
on [**6-18**]/6 without difficulty. The patient was extubated in the
SICU on [**6-16**]/6. Pt experienced SOB s/p removal, CXR taken at that
time showed atelectasis, and he subsequently improved.

On [**6-24**]/6, pt began to have elevated LFT's. CT scan showed
evidence of portal vein thrombosis, and patient was transferred
to the SICU. The patient was intubated and sedated. A
Transcutaneous catheter was placed in the portal vein, and a TPA
bolus and infusion administered, as well as heparin. The portal
vein was stented on [**6-27**]/6. The patient was extubated on [**6-28**]/6.
Pt d/c'd from SICU on [**6-30**]/6. Did well on floor, tolerated oral
intake, ambulated without difficulty. He was maintained on
coumadin, and his INR closely monitored. Initial plan was to
discharge patient on [**7-1**]/6, however his LFT's again increased
slightly. He was monitored overnight, in the AM his LFT's
decreased. PT evaluated the patient and felt that he was safe at
home. The patient was discharged on [**7-3**]/6 in good condition.
His lower extremities were examined, and were negative for
tenderness/pain, and negative Homans sign. The patient will be
maintained on coumadin as an outpatient. He will have his INR
monitored as an outpatient along with his FK levels. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
