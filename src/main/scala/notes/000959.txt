Chief Complaint:
Hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
 [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH of afib on coumadin, htn, and dementia,
was found at home yesterday [**3-28**] being brady to 40s and
hypothermic 86.7F and hypotensive 60/dop in field.  Patient was
given atropine and external paced by EMS. She was brought to ED,
and admitted to MICU.  Within an hour after MICU admission, she
was normothermic on Bair hugger and with warmed IVF, and off
pressors (levophed). HR improved as well.
.
She had garbled speech in the ED, code stroke was called.
Neurology recommended MRI and felt her symptoms were likely
unrelated to an acute stroke.  Garbled speech is her baseline.
It appears that patient has been having increasing agitation at
home recently, and was started on seroquel and had a recent
fall. CTA of brain was negative.
.
Patient was given vanc/zosyn in the ED, which were continued
overnight last night in the MICU, and discontinued this morning.
 Infectious workup is negative so far.  Thyroid function was
normal, and tox screen was negative.  She was found to have INR
of 12, got 10 of IV vitamin K. On transfer to medicine floor,
her BP, HR and body temperature all returned normal.
.
On arrival to the medicine floor, pt was very drowsy.  Her eyes
were closed despite sternal rubs, but she does withdraw to
painful stimuli.  She is not requiring oxygen, and her vital
signs are stable.  She moaned and grimaced when her abdomen was
palpated.

recently started on Seroquel.

CARDIAC: bradycardic, irregularly irregular, normal s1, s2, no
m/r/g
LUNG: clear from anterior
ABDOMEN: normoactive BS, soft, nondistended.  Pt moans and
grimaces when abdomen was palpated.

stimuli. moves all 4 extremities.

CT Brain Perfusion/ CTA Neck:
1. No acute hemorrhage or evidence of acute territorial
infarction, with no evidence of asymmetric perfusion.
2. Central and cortical involutional changes as expected for the
patient's
age of [**Age over 90 **] years.
3. Approximately 40% narrowing of the left internal carotid
artery origin by NASCET criteria. The remaining intra- and
extra-cranial arterial vasculature demonstrates no evidence of
flow-limiting stenosis.
4. Infundibulum at the junction of the A1 segment of the right
ACA and the
ACom vessel.
5. Chronic microvascular ischemic white matter disease.

CXR: Cardiomegaly, mild central congestion. Left basilar
atelectasis.
Limited exam.

CT Head:  No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. No evidence
of change
since a head CT of [**2201-3-28**].


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yof w hypertension, atrial fib, Alzheimer's and [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body
dementia who hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, and AMS.
.
#AMS - Ddx includes poor cerebral perfusion, oversedating
medications (seroquel), infection on underlying dementia.  There
was no evidence of infection and no history of any toxin
ingestion.  CTA of the head/neck could not explain her
somnolence. She is having some episodes of improvement at time
of discharge when she was she was alert and able to make
requests.
.
# Hypothermia: Resolved. Working differential includes sespis,
neurogenic hypothermia, ingestion.  Less likely is adrenal
insufficiency, thiamine deficiency, hypoglycemia,
hypothyroidism.  No evidence of infection.  Monitoring on
telemetry was unremarkable.
.
# Coagulopathy: Patient presented with INR 12.0, which corrected
by time of discharge.  Her PT/PTT also elevated also elevated.
She was given 10mg IV vitamin K.  Thorough evaluation of
coagulation abnormalities was not evaluated further given pt's
overall poor prognosis as it was unlikley to change managemnet.
Pt's family expressly does not want pt to receive blood
transfusion.

# Hypotension: Resolved after rewarming.  No evidence after
broad workup for infection, as stated above.
.
# Bradycardia: Resolved.  Patient received atropine received in
the field.  Her heart rate normalized, although she generally
remains slow.  HR drops to high 30s during sleep and she
otherwise asymptomatic.  Pt not to be paced if becomes
bradycardic, may receive atropine if necessary.

# Hypernatremia: Pt was hypernatremic on admission, improved
with free water boluses.
.
# Acute renal failure: improving with IVF.  Likely pre-renal (on
lasix as outpt). Pt was discharged with prn lasix for signs of
volume overload such as increasing oxygen requirement,
respiratory distress, or lower extremity edema.

# Abd discomfort: Pt presented with abdominal discomfort.  KUB
shows non obstructive gas pattern, but consistent with
constipation.  She was initiated on a bowel regimen.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Since hospitalization plt count 80-90s.  DIC
workup in ICU negative.  Platelets remained low but stable.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt is afib with slow ventricular response
on tele.  Coumadin was discontinued on this admission due to
high maintenance required with this medication.  This is
consistent with the overall plan to focus on comfort care.
.
# Alzheimer and [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body Dementia:  Pt was admitted on Aricept
which was discontinued to reduce unnecessary medications.
.
# Hypertension:  Pt's blood pressure was low on admission.  All
BP meds were held.  They were discontinued prior to discharge to
reduce medications that are not directed towards comfort care.
.
# Diastolic CHF: Compensated currently. Cardiac medications
minimized to prn lasix.
.
# Degenerative joint disease/osteoarthritis:  Tylenol and
Mortrin prn for pain control.

# Goals of care:  Pt is DNR/DNI, with the understanding that pt
does not want advancement of care.  Treatment should be focused
on comfort based care.  Family would not want rehospitalization
without communication with health care proxy.
