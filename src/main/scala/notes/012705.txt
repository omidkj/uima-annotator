Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
History of emphysematous cholecystitis.

Major [**First Name3 (LF) 2947**] or Invasive Procedure:
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy - [**2166-8-8**].


History of Present Illness:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 33561**] is a 84 year old Arabic-speaking
gentleman with a history of a lengthy admission downtown for
emphysematous cholecystitis.  This was managed with a
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube by one of my colleagues prior
to his care being turned over to myself.  He required ICU care
and multiple antibiotic courses for bacteremia and sepsis.
During his hospital stay, he improved with regard to the
cholecystitis.  Subsequent imaging failed to show any further
gas in the wall of the gallbladder.  The percutaneous
cholecystostomy tube did have to be replaced secondary to this
being displaced.  He also had acute-on-chronic renal failure.
He has some baseline renal insufficiency, but did require CVVH
and then dialysis during his hospital stay.  He typically
follows with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**] for his renal disease.  During
the prior hospital stay, he also had diastolic CHF, which
responded to diuresis, which was continued upon discharge.  He
has had an additional brief admission for hyperkalemia but was
again discharged to [**Hospital1 **] where he is having his
rehabilitation.  According to him and his daughter, he has been
eating well, tolerating a diet.  He has been moving his bowels.
He has been beginning to walk with help at the rehabilitation
facility.  He has no abdominal pain and no complaints. He was
admitted for planned laparoscopic cholecytectomy.

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: gallbladder.
DIAGNOSIS:
Gallbladder:
- Chronic cholecystitis.
- Cholelithiasis, pigment type.
- Adherent cauterized benign liver parenchyma.

Clinical:  Cholelithiasis.
Gross:

The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name,
"[**Known lastname 33561**], [**Known firstname 33564**]" and the medical record number and
"gallbladder." It consists of an already disrupted gallbladder
measuring overall 6.8 x 3 x 1.6 cm. There is significant cautery
on the external surface.  No cystic duct lymph node is
identified.  The opened gallbladder contains no bile and
gallstones numbering approximately 20. The stones are of the
pigment type and measure 2.4 x 1.2 cm in aggregate. The
gallbladder mucosa is erythematous and velvety. The gallbladder
wall measures to be 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The
gallbladder wall is thickened but soft.  The specimen is then
represented as follows: A = cystic duct mucosa and sections of
gallbladder wall, B = additional sections of gallbladder wall.
.
[**2166-8-10**] Renal U/S:
RENAL ULTRASOUND: There is no evidence of hydronephrosis in the
kidneys.
There are multiple bilateral renal cysts, the largest on the
right measuring up to 9.1 x 8.3 x 6.5 cm. The right kidney
measures 15.4 cm which includes measurement of the exophytic
cyst at the lower pole. The left kidney measures 10.6 cm. The
bladder is decompressed by Foley catheter, incompletely
evaluated.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Bilateral renal cysts, not significantly changed from prior.
.
[**2166-8-12**] ECG:
Sinus tachycardia, rate 108. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Left
anterior
hemiblock. Consider biatrial enlargement. Poor R wave
progression. Non-specific ST-T wave changes in leads I, aVL and
leads V5-V6. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2166-8-5**] the rate
has increased and the lateral T wave changes are slightly more
prominent.
   Intervals Axes:
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T

.
[**2166-8-16**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but has
decreased in size
with associated improvement in reported pulmonary vascular
congestion. Lung volumes are slightly greater in the interval,
and there has been marked improved aeration at the left base.
There remains a confluent area of opacification in the right
retrocardiac region, as well as small bilateral pleural
effusions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right basilar retrocardiac opacification, which could reflect
pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
2. Near-resolution of left basilar opacity.
3. Small pleural effusions, with improvement on the right.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General [**Month/Day/Year 2947**] Service for
evaluation of the aforementioned problem.  On [**2166-8-8**], the
patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which went
well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note
for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived on the floor tolerating a clear liquid diet, on
IV fluids, with a foley catheter and JP drain in place, and
Percocet PO and Morphine IV PRN for pain control.  He received
two doses of IV Ciprofloxacin peri-operatively. The patient was
hemodynamically stable.

POD#1: Pain well controlled on Percocet. Tolerated clear to
regular diet. Failed to void after foley discontinued; foley
replaced. JP discontinued.
POD#2: Experienced two episodes emesis; diet returned to NPO.
Given Zofran. IVF restarted. Renal Service consulted for
progressively increase creatinine in context of the patient's
history of chronic renal insufficiency. Renal Ultrasound
performed -no hydronephrosis, bladder decompressed by foley.
Acute on chronic renal failure believed secondary to post-renal
obstruction from BPH. Later in evening, became agitated and
confused. Temporary limb restraints applied. Lasix discontinued.
NGT replaced. Patient self-discontinued.
POD#3: Continued agitation, confusion overnight. Again required
restraints and freq
