History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx significant for mild diastolic heart failure,
COPD, atrial fibrillation sent from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for respiratory
distress, with O2 sats in the 70s. Reportedly, he received 240
mg PO lasix as well as 4 mg SL morphine at the NH. He was on
BiPAP on arrival. ECG in the ED was difficult to interpret,
showing demand pacing with intermittent a.fib with concerning
changes laterally (no R waves in V4-V6). On arrival to the ED,
the patient's VS were T= 98.2; BP= 115/89; HR= 80s; RR= 30s; O2
sat= 100% on BiPAP 100%. He was given 40 mg IV lasix and put out
30-40 cc of urine. He was given vanc/cefepime for possible PNA
on CXR. Also, of note, he was tried on a nitro gtt, which
initially caused some hypotension.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient's VS were T= 97.6; BP=
123/63; HR= 90; RR= 27; O2 sat= 98% on BiPAP. He was somnolent
and was not able to give a history. He did indicate by nodding
that he was short of breath. NH records indicated that he was
experiencing lightheadedness, SOB, DOE, orthopnea, poor
appetite, mild nausea, and fatigue. Per NH records, he was not
experiencing chest pain, palpitations, or abdominal pain.

[**2171-3-6**] Blood cultures x 2: PND
.
[**2171-3-6**]: Sputum
Gram stain: >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field. NO
MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Culture: RARE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
.
[**2171-3-7**]: MRSA screen - positive
.
EKG [**2171-3-6**]: Ventricular paced rhythm with underlying atrial
fibrillation versus irregular supraventricular tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no diagnostic change.
.
Echocardiogram, transthoracic [**2171-3-7**]: The left atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high
cardiac output. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-5-25**],
moderate pulm hypertension is now detected.

CXR (portable AP) [**2171-3-6**]: Pulmonary edema with left pleural
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o M with history of CHF, ?COPD who was sent to the ED from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab for respiratory distress.
.
# Respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory failure was
thought to be multifactorial, related to congestive heart
failure and likely also COPD. Pneumonia was also considered in
the initial differential diagnosis. The patient was treated with
nitroglycerin, morphine, oxygen, Lasix, nebulizers, vancomycin,
cefepime, and Bipap. However, he developed progressive
hypercarbia, requiring intubation on [**2171-3-7**]. The patient was
extubated on [**2171-3-8**], after about 30 hours of mechanical
ventillation. Vancomycin and cefepime were narrowed to
cefpodoxime on [**2171-3-9**] (to treat urinary tract infection, as
pneumonia was thought to be unlikely). On the morning of [**2171-3-10**],
the patient became increasingly hypoxemic and tachypneic. A
family meeting was held, and the decision was made to treat the
patient with medications, and, if necessary, Bipap, but not
intubation. The patient's symptoms improved with diuresis and
nebulizers, and he was discharged on [**2171-3-11**], with a plan for
more comfort-oriented care. Patient needs Q4H monitoring of
oxygen saturations.He is on a 10 day steroid taper for his COPD
during which time he will also be on sliding scale insulin.
.
# Acute diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient
presented in respiratory distress. Echocardiogram showed LVEF
>75%, with new pulmonary hypertension, but was otherwise
baseline. MI was ruled out with serial cardiac enzymes. The
patient was treated with vasodilators, diuresis, and mechanical
ventillation, as explained above. The patient was discharged on
Lasix 80 mg PO BID.
.
# RHYTHM: The patient presented in a demand-paced rhythm with
underlying atrial fibrillation. He also had a supraventricular
tachycardia that was thought to be AVNRT, and a wide-complex
tachycardia (with rate around 100) that was thought to be an
accelerated idioventricular rhythm versus slow ventricular
tachycardia. The patient is on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
This was briefly held in the setting of supratherapeutic INRs,
for the the patient received vitamin K. Coumadin was restarted
on [**2171-3-10**]. The patient will need to have his INR followed after
discharge.
.
# Hypotension: The patient briefly required a dopamine infusin
