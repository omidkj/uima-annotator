Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4309**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough and dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year-old male with history of COPD with 3L baseline
oxygen requirement, bioprostetic mitral valve replacement,
coronary artery disease status post CABG, left ventricular
psuedoaneurysm, left carotid stent, who was admitted for
worsening dyspnea and productive cough.  At baseline, his
activities are limited by dyspnea.  He does not climb stairs in
home and has stair chair.  He requires assistance with his ADLs.
 Over the past few months, he has had worsening dyspnea on
exertion to the point of becoming dyspneic after about 20 steps.
 Over the past week, he describes not feeling well with
subjective weakness.   The morning of admission, he developed a
productive cough.  He denies fevers and chills.  He has been
intermittently compliant with his home lasix regimen.  He states
that he has to urinate about 20-25 times a day and has missed
several doses last week.   He stopped taking his lasix 3 days
prior to admission.  Review of systems is negative for chest
pain, palpitations, light-headedness, nausea, or vomiting.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Dyspnea / hypoxia - The etiology of patient's dyspnea and
hypoxia was thought to be multifactorial. The patient has known
severe COPD, necessitating chronic home supplemental oxygen
therapy. Given his one week history of malaise and weakness,
along with his new productive cough, there was likely an element
of an acute COPD exacerbation. However, the patient's family had
also reported a history of noncompliance with his diuretics, and
he appeared grossly volume overloaded on exam at admission. He
was started on high dose intravenous steroids, nebulizer
treatments, and a course of antibiotics for a COPD exacerbation.
 He was also agressively diuresed with IV lasix a CHF flare.  He
improved dramatic with these interventions, and was
symptomatically back to baseline by hospital day 5.  His oxygen
requirement also improved to his baseline of 3L by nasal canula.
 Despite this improvement, however, the patient continued to
have transient hypoxic episodes to the 70s but recovered quickly
with supplemental oxygen therapy via facemask.  These episodes
were thought to be secondary to mucous plugging.  Given the
increased frequency of his hypoxic episodes with increased work
of breathing, he was transfered to the intensive care unit for
further monitoring.  He did not require intubation.  An
echocardiogram showed severe pulmonary hypertension.  Given the
severity and irreverisble nature of his disease, the family
decided to make him DNR/DNI with the goal of [**Name (NI) **] care.  His
respiratory status was supported with nebulizer treatments and
supplemental oxygen.
.
2) Cardiac - He has a substantial coronary artery disease
history including a 4 vessle CABG.  He ruled out for MI by
serial enzymes on admission.  He was continued on an aspirin and
statin.  A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed
hypokinesis of the right ventrible with a PA pressure of ~100.
.
3) Atrial Fibrillation: During the later part of his admission,
he had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular rate.  At baseline, he was rate controlled with
digoxin.  However, he required diltazam to control his rate.  At
the end of the admission, his rate was unable to be controlled
without dropping his pressure.
.
4) ?Endocarditis - An incidental finding on his echocardiogram
showed that his prosthetic mitral valve had a small echodensity
on it consistent with endocarditis verse a fibrinous cord.  He
remained afebrile while he was monitored with serial blood
cultures.  One set came back positive for MRSA, and he was
started on daptomycin.  At that time, his white count began to
rise to 30.  Another blood culture while on antibiotics also
grew out MRSA.  At that point, the patient's condition began to
deteriorate.  The family decided to take him home with [**Name (NI) **]
so the antibiotics were discontinued.
.
5) Renal insufficiency - He has known chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine between 1.5-1.6.  He
had some worsened renal failure with intravenous lasix
administration.  This improved when his diuresis was halted and
he has remained relatively euvolemic without supplemental lasix.
.
6) Anemia - He has known chronic anemia secondary to blood loss.
On previous upper and lower endoscopies, he has been noted to
have angiectasias, diverticuli, and internal hemorrhoids. His
iron studies on a previous admission in [**2195-2-8**] showed a
normal serum iron. His hematocrit since that time has been
stable 25-28.  His hematocrit remained stable.  Anticoagulation
for his hypokinesis was considered but deferred after discussion
with his PCP who felt that his bleeding risk outweighed any
benefit from anticoagulaion.
.
7) Thrombocytopenia - HE has chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear
etiology. Electronic allergy records list an allergyy to
Prilosec as causing thrombocytopenia. However, review of
discharge summaries from the time when the allergy was recorded
revealed that the culprit was thought to be more likely
linezolid. The patient had tolerated Nexium at that time, and
had been taking it as an outpatient prior to this admission. A
DIC panel and HIT antibody during this hospitalization were
negative.  His platelet count has remained relatively stable
around 100.
.
8) Hyperglycemia - He carries a diagnosis of postprandial
hyperglycemia.  A recent Hb a1c on [**2195-4-28**] was 6.5.  His blood
sugars were monitored while on steroids, and he was covered with
a humalog insulin
