[**11-17**]. She had initially been admitted in [**Month (only) 359**] with complete
heart block now s/p pacer. Her long hospital course was
complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring multiple DCCV and
amiodarone loads, respritory failure, congestive heart failure,
chronic metabolic alkolosis, was discharged Saturday to rehab
after a trach and PEG were placed by IP. She was sent out on
Lovenox and coumadin (for porcine valve and afib). She was doing
well at rehab until Sunday night when she began to pull at her
tubes. She was placed in restraints. On Monday, she was noted to
be oozing from her Peg and trach sites. Her hematocrit at that
time was 25 down from 29 on Sunday. She had guiac positive stool
and the question of melana at [**Hospital1 **].
In the ED: HCT stable at 25. GI consult saw the patient and
clots were cleared after 150cc PEG lavage. Her blood pressure
dropped to 70/p but increased then to 97/p after 500cc bolus.

[**2169-11-21**]
AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There are small lung
volumes. There is cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions.
There is left lower lobe atelectasis. The previously described
round ring-like lucency at the right apex is not visualized on
the current study. The patient is status post sternotomy with
aortic valve replacement. Again noted is a dual lead pacemaker
with leads intact.

IMPRESSION:
1) Cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions and prominence
of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with CHF, not
significantly changed compared to the prior study.
2) Left lower lobe atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Bleeding from Trach and PEG: The patient was admitted for a
GI bleed which was actually from the inside of her PEG. She is
likely bleeding from the anticoagulation for her afib and valve
and her poor nutritional status. She underwent a bronchoscopy on
[**11-22**] which did not reveal a bleeding trach site or any
abnormalities in the lungs. Two days before discharge, the
oozing around the trach and PEG sites had stopped as her INR
drifted downward. She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks
and the issue of restarting the coumadin.

2. Hypotension: The patient is initially hypotensive on
admission and appeared volume depleted blood loss or due to
infection. After one transfusion and fluid, her blood pressure
rose and her metoprolol was restarted.  She was then transfused
a second unit to raise her Hematocrit to above 30. Her CBC
should be check again in 1 week.

3. Pulm: Her vent setting were kept the same throught her stay.

4. Hypothyroidsm: The patient's TSH was checked on day of
discharge during the last admission. GIven it was high (6.7) and
the patient has a history of hypothyroidsm. she was restarted on
Levothyoxl. Her TSH should be checked again in 2 weeks and
adjustments should be made in her dose.

5. Nutrition: The patient was continued on tube feeds and this
will be continued [**Hospital **] rehab. They are currently continuous but
can be changed to cycled to allow her to sit up and undergo
physical therapy.

6. Access: She was admitted with a R IJ that was removed on day
of discharge.

7. ID: The patient had one out of 6 blood cultures positive for
GPC in clusters. She was clinically stable without fever and
this was felt to be a contaminant. She was given one dose of
vancomycin.  Her line was removed and the tip was sent for
culture.  The final speciation and tip culture will need to be
followed up by her PCP or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
