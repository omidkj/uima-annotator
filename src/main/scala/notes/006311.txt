was 16.  Neurologic examination revealed a very pleasant
male.  Awake, alert, and oriented times three.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  No rubs.  A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur loudest at
the left sternal border.  Lung examination revealed breath
sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Gastrointestinal examination revealed positive bowel sounds.
Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity examination
revealed radial pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  Femoral pulses
were 2+ bilaterally.  Popliteal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  Carotid pulses
were 2+ and without bruits.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed hematocrit was 34.6 and platelets were 349.
Prothrombin time was 12.4, partial thromboplastin time was
20.8, and INR was 1.  Sodium was 138, potassium was 4.5,
chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was
55, and creatinine was 1.9.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Catheterization from [**Hospital3 1280**]
Hospital showed a 90% right coronary artery, 90% circumflex,
80% left anterior descending artery, 70% second diagonal, and
70% posterior left ventricular with an ejection fraction of
45%.  Trace mitral regurgitation.

A carotid ultrasound showed less than 40% stenosis of the
internal carotid artery bilaterally.

A chest x-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  On the day after transfer
to [**Hospital1 69**] the patient was
brought to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting times four.  Please see the Operative
Note for full details.

In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft
times four with left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the right
coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse
marginal, and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.  He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient had dopamine at 3 mcg/kg
per minute, insulin at 9 units per hour, and Levophed at
0.025 mcg/kg per minute.  He remained hemodynamically stable
in the immediate postoperative period.  His anesthesia was
reversed.  He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully
extubated.   However, he did continue to require Levophed and
dopamine for blood pressure control.

By the end on postoperative day two, the patient had been
weaned from the Levophed.  However, he was continued on
dopamine for renal perfusion.

On postoperative day five, all of the patient's chest tubes,
Foley catheter, and central venous lines were discontinued,
and he was transferred to the floor for continued
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next 48 hours, with the assistance of the nursing
staff and physical therapist, the patient's activity level
was advanced.  Throughout this period, he remained
hemodynamically stable.

On postoperative day six, it was decided that the patient was
steady and ready to be discharged to home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of discharge,
the patient's physical examination revealed vital signs with
a temperature of 98, heart rate was 78 (in a sinus rhythm),
blood pressure was 140/62, respiratory rate was 18, and
oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.  Weight preoperatively
was 94.8 kilograms and on discharge was 101.8 kilograms.
Physical examination revealed the patient was alert and
oriented times three.  The patient moved all extremities and
followed commands.  Respiratory examination revealed the
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
The sternum was stable.  The incision with Steri-Strips
opened to air, clean and dry.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities were warm and well perfused with 1+ edema
bilaterally.  The left lower extremity saphenous vein graft
site with Steri-Strips opened to air, clean and dry.

revealed white blood cell count was 7.7, hematocrit was 28.5,
and platelets were 335.  Sodium was 139, potassium was 3.9,
chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was
46, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 115.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Medications on discharge
included)
1.  Simvastatin 80 mg p.o. once per day.
2.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice per day times one week; then once

4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  Gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. twice per day.
6.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 10 mg p.o. q.p.m.
7.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 1000 mg p.o. q.p.m.
8.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o. q.6h. as needed.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four

descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the right coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal, and
saphenous vein graft to diagonal).
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
