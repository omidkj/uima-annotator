Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest heaviness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization with PTCA and placement of bare metal
stent in proximal RCA.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 87 year old female with history of hypertension
who presents with chest heaviness. Patient was in her usual
state of health until the morning prior to admission, when she
experienced chest "heaviness" and "lumpiness", substernal,
radiating to left arm. She describes the sensation as
non-painful, and not very distressing, except that she had never
experienced it before and it was constant/persistent. The day of
admission, the heaviness began to intensify after lunch, around
2 pm. Patient lives at [**Location (un) **] independent living and became
concerned with the persistence of her symptoms, so she contact[**Name (NI) **]
the home nurses associated with [**Location (un) **]. Per her nurses, she
was denying pain at the time they evaluated her but she was
complaining of L arm tingling. Her vitals at the time: BP
160/100, HR 100s, satting 98% on RA. She appeared diaphoretic.
Her nurses contact[**Name (NI) **] EMS, who checked an EKG which demonstated
ST elevations in leads III and AVF. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further eval.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: Pulse 112, SBP 167, rr 26, 99%
ra. An EKG demonstrated ST elevations in leads II (1mm), III and
aVF (2+mm), with reciprocal ST depressions in I, aVL, and V2.
Cath lab was activated. Pt received plavix 600 mg po x1,
morphine 1 mg, asa 325 mg po x1, and was placed on 4000 units of
heparin, plus heparin gtt. During cath, pt was noted to have 90%
stenosis of proximal LAD to diagonal, LCX with 80-90 % proximal
disease.


Past Medical History:
(no previous hospitalizations)
1) Hypertension
2) Multiple basal cell cancers and one SCC on leg, s/p surgery
3) s/p R eye cataract surgery


Social History:
Patient lives at independent living with home nursing as above.
No tobacco history, drinks one EtOH per 2 months. Never married,
no children.

Family History:
Strokes in multiple members, brother MI at 74.

.
EKG: Sinus rhythm, rate 113. Normal QRS axis. Normal PR, QRS,
and QT intervals. [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in II, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in
III and aVF. ST depressions of 1 mm in I, 2 mm in aVL, and 3 mm
in V2. No Q waves.
.
CATH: Right dominant system revealed 3 vessel CAD. The LMCA had
no apparent disease. The LAD had a 90% proximal stenosis to D1
and formed a twin system with a diagonal and large septal that
gave collaterals to the RCA. There was a large ramus with a
diffuse 80-90%
stenosis. The RCA had a 100% stenosis proximally. Resting
hemodynamics: RA mean pressure of 12 mm Hg. The RVSP was 62
with an RVEDP of 15 mm Hg. The PASP was 62 mm Hg with a mean of
45 mm
Hg. The PCWP was elevated at 35 mm Hg. The cardiac output was
5.0 and
index 2.9. LV gram deferred. Successful PCI/stent to proximal
RCA with a 2.5mm x 23mm Vision stent postdilated with a 3.0mm NC
balloon. Excellent result with normal flow down vessel and no
residual stenosis.
.
Transthoracic Echo [**2106-6-14**]:
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
No LV mass/thrombus. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No
valvular AS. The increased transaortic velocity is related to
high cardiac output. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is focal apical hypokinesis. The remaining segments are
hyperdynamic. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
preserved (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 87 year old woman with hypertension who presented
with an inferior STEMI.
.
# Coronary artery disease: Patient had several risk factors,
including HTN and hyperlipidemia but had no prior history of
myocardial infarction or anginal symptoms. Her EKG was
consistent with an inferior STEMI with 100% occluded RCA,
3-vessel disease found on catherization. She had a bare metal
stent placed in the RCA. She may require require further
intervention for disease noted in her left circumflex and LAD,
to be determined in several weeks time after outpatient follow
up. Her CK peaked at 1722 (MB 278) at 12 am on [**2106-6-13**]. She had
one additional episode ofchest pain on [**6-13**], with an EKG showed
TWI and <1 mm STE in V3-V6. No intervention was taken.
At time of discharge, she was on changed to simvastatin 80 mg
(from atorvastatin 80 mg), Plavix 75 mg, Aspirin 325 mg, and
12.5 mg of metoprolol twice daily. Of note, her baseline liver
function tests were mildly elevated, possibly in setting of
myocardial infarction. She was not able to tolerate addition of
an ace-inhibitor or further up-titration of her beta-blocker due
to asymptomatic hypotension overnight while sleeping (systolic
in the 80's).
- Further titration of her beta-blocker, including transition to
a once-daily formulation, and addition of an ace-inhibitor, may
be further managed on an outpatient basis in follow-up.
.
# Heart function: Patient has had no prior echo. She had no
difficulties with oxygenation or shortness of breath. Her JVP
was noted to be mildly elevated at 9 cm. Her left and right
heart catherizations revealed elevated pressures, suggestive of
left ventricular systolic dysfunction in setting of inferior
myocardial infarction versus diastolic dysfunction in setting of
longstanding hypertension. She may also have some right
ventricular involvement with RCA occlusion. She was mildly
diruesed until she appeared euvolemic.  A transthoracic echo was
completed on [**6-14**] which showed a cardiac output of 10 L/min, 1+
MR, 1+ TR, EF of 55%. She had no clinical signs of failure, a
normal TSH 3.7, stable (although trendi
