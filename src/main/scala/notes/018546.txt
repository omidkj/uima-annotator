2. left-dominant circulation.  The LMCA was short and patent.
The LAD had diffuse disease with a long high-grade stenosis at
the
bifurcation of a large and diseased D1.  The LCX had a long 70%
stenosis of the proximal vessel with a focal 80% stenosis in the
midvessel.
3. abdominal aorta- diffuse mild disease.  50-60% right common
iliac disease, 80% RCFA stenosis and a 50% LCFA stenosis.
4. A 7 French 30 cc IABP was placed via LCFA.

Echo:
Elongated LA,  mild sym. lvh, LVEF mod depressed (35-40%),

Carotid studies- right 60-69% and a left 70-79% carotid
stenosis.
.
MRA/MRA head - High-grade stenosis of the left internal carotid
artery at the bifurcation with moderate-to-severe stenosis of
the right internal carotid artery at the bifurcation. Complete
loss of signal beginning at the petrous portion of the left
internal carotid artery. A Gadolinium enhance MRA could be
performed to differentiate a high grade stenosis from an
occlusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73 year old male with HTN, CAD, who is admitted with acute
dyspnea and on catheterization was noted to have 3 vessel
disease.
.
# Cardiac: Ischemia/+troponin: Peak CK 539.  On catheterization
pt was noted to have multivessel disease.  Immediately post cath
pt was placed on IABP given his multivessel disease and likely
bypass surgery soon after.  However on consultation with CT
surgery it was thought that the episode of ischemia was not
likely due to an acute ischemic event.  He was diuresed and IABP
was removed on post cath day2.  Pt was also started on
ASA,Plavix,statin/ACEI/BB.  CT surgery recommended work up of
bilateral carotid stenosis, PFTs and COPD workup prior to
elective scheduling for bypass surgery as outpt.
.
PUMP:  Pt had elevated filling pressures on cath and Depressed
EF 35%on echo.  Pt was diuresed while the IABP and swan were
inplace.  Pulmonary pressures decreased with diuresis.  His
shortness of breath improved and did not have any further
episodes of acute dyspnea.
.
Rhythm: Sinus.
.
# PVD(CAROTID and femorals) - carotid ultrasound.  R 60-69%
stenosis, L 80% stenosis.  Pt underwent MRI/MRA which revealed
bilateral stenosis.  [**Doctor First Name 3098**] with significant stenosis which could
not be intervened by interventional cardiolgoy.  Pt did have
collaterals from likely Ant. Communicating artery to the LMCA
and LACA.  On catheterization pt was also noted to have
significant stenosis of femoral arteries bilaterally, R>L.  ABI
were done inhouse however the final report is pending at time of
discharge.  He will followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 2 month time for
?peripheral intervention.
.
# PULMONARY/ID - ?RLL infiltrate on presentation cxr.  Pt with
also WBC of 20K on admission.  he was started on treatement for
CAP with levofloxacin.  Mild productive cough persisted during
the hospitilization.  Treated with Levofloxacin 250 mg po qd x 7
days.
- given significant smoking history pt will likely need PFTs
prior to CABG per CT surgery recs.
.
# DM2 - Pt was maintained on RISS while in house started on his
usual outpt regimen on discharge.
.
# Glaucoma - Continue predforte and ketorolac (outpatient meds)
.
# Dispo - Short term rehab.  Pt will follow up with CT [**Doctor First Name **],
Cardiology and PCP.
