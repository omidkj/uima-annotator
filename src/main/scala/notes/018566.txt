History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 36 year old female with a history of SLE, lupus
nephritis, ESRD on PD who presented to the ER with two days of
chest pain and worsening shortness of breath. At home she had
been having pain. She had been having pain during her PD
sessions at home, and was having difficulty tolerating the PD
sessions, so she stopped doing her home PD sessions Sunday
evening. Over the next few days, she started having more
shortness of breath, was experiencing chest heaviness, orthopnea
and PND. Her shortness of breath worsened over, and she
presented to the ER today for further evaluation. She denies any
cough, nasal congestion, fever/chills, night sweats, n/v/d. Does
have her baseline abdominal pain and has felt worsening
"abdominal heaviness" since missing her PD sessions.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T-98.2 P-124 BP-133/92 R-24 O2
sat-98%. On arrival she was tachypneic to the 20's, complaining
of chest heaviness and also tachycardic. She had a CXR that
showed bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary vascular
congestion, an EKG that showed sinus tachycardia with TWI in I,
AVL. An echocardiogram was done that was mostly unchanged from
prior, showing an LVEF of 40% with severe 3+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] showed
7.47/34/179, troponin of 0.09, CK of 135, MB of 3, BNP>[**Numeric Identifier **], K+
was 5.3, serum tox was positive for tricyclics, otherwise
negative. She was given 60mg IV lasix as she still makes urine,
SL nitro x 2, and levofloxacin to cover for CAP.
.
On the floor, her initial VS were: T-96.5, HR-133, BP-128/97,
RR-38, 100% on NRB. She continues to complain of shortness of
breath, despite stable oxygen saturations. She also continues to
complain of abdominal pain/heaviness, and generally feels
overwhelmed with her illness and doing the PD at home, has also
not been having as regular of bowel movements at home recently.
Also of note, she was recently on a prednisone taper for a lupus
flare, where she experiences vague symptoms, including SOB,
arthritis, abdominal heaviness.
.

----------------
[**2196-8-16**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-7-29**],
the heart rate is now higher and LVEF is slightly lower.
.
[**2196-8-17**] CXR (PA and Lat): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study
of [**8-16**], there are bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis and engorgement of pulmonary vessels, consistent
with the clinical impression of volume overload. The possibility
of supervening pneumonia cannot be definitely excluded and would
have to be made on clinical grounds.


Brief Hospital Course:
#) Volume Overload/Shortness of Breath: in the setting of
missing PD sessions, likely due to volume overload, especially
in the context of the findings on CXR, and echo.  Also possible
is PNA.  We consulted the renal team and continued Ms. [**Known
