Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2179-5-14**] - Right Thoracotomy, Redo Mitral Valve Replacement(27mm
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical Valve), and Tricuspid Valve Repair(30mm
Annuloplasty Band).
[**2179-4-30**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 66-year-old female with complex cardiac history who
presented to outside hospital with congestive heart failure and
biliary colic. She required diuresis and and underwent GI workup
which revealed gallstones. She was referred for cholecystectomy
but anesthesia refused without cardiac clearance. Subsequent
nuclear stress test was notable for inferior-inferoapical
segment defect and anterolateral ischemia.  She was also noted
to have a significant run of ventricular tachycardia without
symptoms. Given the above clinical picture, she was referred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization with ICD placement. On
review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems
is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  She
does experience ankle edema when her CHF gets out of control.

[**2179-4-30**] Cardiac catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated a normal LMCA. The LAD was patent with an occluded
diagonal branch. The LCX was patent. The RCA was occluded
proximally. 2. Graft angiography demonstrated a patent SVG to
RCA and patent SVG to diagonal; this was a Y-graft with the
diagonal graft coming off the RCA graft. The LIMA to LAd was
patent but was a small vessel.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated biventricular
filling
pressures with evidence of constriction or pseudoconstriction,
including
prominent V-waves on PCW tracing. There was severe pulmonary
arterial
hypertension (74 mmHg) with slight improvement on 100% oxygen
therapy.
4. Left ventriculography showed severely depressed LV systolic
function
with 28% LVEF, grossly dilated LV and global hypokinesis with
inferoapical akinesis. 5. There was 3+ mitral regurgitation
through the bioprosthetic valve.
[**2179-5-3**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Only minimal calcifications within the aortic root and
ascending aorta.
2. Status post CABG with significant calcifications of the
native coronary arteries.
3. Status post mitral valve replacement. Calcifications within
the superior and inferior wall of the left atrium.
4. Multiple pulmonary nodules, two of them containing mixed
solid and ground glass components.
5. Indeterminate left adrenal lesion. Given its relatively
smooth borders and round shape, it is most likely benign,
especially if there is no history of primary malignancy
elsewhere.
[**2179-5-3**] Groin Ultrasound:
There is a 5 x 13 x 6 mm pseudoaneurysm originating from the
right common femoral artery. There is no evidence of AV fistula.
[**2179-5-4**] Echocardiogram:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve is noted.
The prosthesis is abnormal. The gradients are higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen with a mild (1+) anterior paravalvar leak.
The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric.
[**2179-5-5**] Renal Ultrasound:
1. No hydronephrosis. Normal renal cortical thickness and
echogenicity.
2. Incidental note is made of cholelithiasis.
[**2179-5-5**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Moderate plaque with a right 40-59% carotid stenosis. On the
left, there is a less than 40% stenosis.
[**2179-5-11**] Abdominal/Pelvic CT Scan:
1. Large hematoma within the right anterior thigh with expansion
of the muscles extending from the groin to the knee with focal
hyperdense areas suggestive of active bleeding.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
3. 2.5 x 2.0 cm hypodense lesion within the left adrenal gland,
not fully characterized.
4. 1.9 x 1.7 cm right adnexal cyst. If clinically indicated,
ultrasound is recommended for further characterization.
5. Bilateral nonobstructive renal calculi, the largest one in
the left kidney measuring 6 mm.
6. 2.9 cm right renal cyst.
7. 2-mm lung nodule in the left lower lobe. According to the
[**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society recommendations, in low-risk patients with
nodules less than 4 mm, no followup is needed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted and initially maintained on intravenous Heparin. The
following day, she underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed severely depressed left ventricular systolic
function(LVEF estimated at 28%), a grossly dilated left
ventricle and global hypokinesis with inferoapical akinesis.
There was 3+ mitral regurgitation through the bioprosthetic
valve. Graft angiography demonstrated patent vein grafts with
patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery.

Based upon the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted and
further evaluation was performed. The EP service was also
consulted and fel
