Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for cholangitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
#ERCP w/ Stent Removal and Replacement
#Placement of percutaneous billiary drain to clear abcess


History of Present Illness:
84yo female with multiple medical problems including coronary
artery disease s/p CABG, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, chronic
diastolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease was
transferred from an OSH for further evaluation of abdominal
pain.

She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from 7/25-29/09 to the surgical
service for evaluation of abdominal pain. At that time, she
underwent an ERCP which demonstrated the following: "filling
defect that appeared like a stone at the distal CBD, 2cm distal
CBD narrowing and post obstructive dilation and measured
15mm in diameter. Also there was intrahepatic dilation of the
biliary tree." Sphincterotomy was not performed as patient was
on plavix at the time. Follow-up CTA Abdomen was obtained which
revealed "porta hepatis lymphadenopathy and suggestion of lower
CBD soft tissue at the site of filling defect on ERCP
raises possibility of cholangiocarcinoma." Cytology specimens
were negative for malignancy and CEA was 3.1 (not elevated). She
was then discharged with plans to repeat the ERCP and EUS in [**2-2**]
weeks after cardiology evaluation and consideration of stopping
aspirin and plavix prior to repeat procedure. In fact, she was
scheduled to have a stress test performed on [**2185-8-1**] in
anticipation of a likely repeat GI procedure; however, she
presented to an OSH on [**2185-7-28**] with RUQ pain radiating to her
substernal chest. She was admitted to for rule-out MI. Her
hospital course was complicated by a temperature to 100.5 and
CXR demonstrating dilated pulmonary vasculature. She was started
on unasyn and gentamicin for treatment of presumed cholangitis
and was diuresed with IV lasix.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she reports feeling generally well and
without abdominal pain.

IMAGING:
[**2185-7-28**] CXR (OSH) - questionable nodule identified overlying the
heart and possibly in the left lower lobe. It is visible on a
chest radiograph from [**12-9**] and has not changed. No active
disease seen elsewhere
.
[**2185-7-29**] Abdominal US (OSH) - choledocholithiasis and
cholelithiasis. There is gallbladder sludge present and there is
borderline mural thickening. There is choledocholithiasis noted
and pneumobili. By report, the patient has undergone recent
biliary stenting which would account for the pneumobili. No
definite intrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen
.
[**2185-7-30**] Portable CXR (OSH)  - left ventricular dilatation.
Post-surgical changes in left hemithorax. Lungs are well
expanded. Oval nodular density at the left base behind the
heart. remainder of the lungs are clear.
.
[**2185-8-1**]: ERCP: Scout view demonstrates a plastic biliary stent
in the right upper quadrant. Subsequent images demonstrate
cannulation of the common bile duct with irregularity in the
region of the stent, and stable common bile duct and
intrahepatic ductal dilatation. No definite filling defects are
seen. Stent removal and replacement is noted. Please refer to
the operative note for further details.
.
[**2185-8-3**]: Abd U/S: 1. Gallbladder sludge. No evidence of acute
cholecystitis. 2. Pneumobilia, presumably related to recent ERCP
procedure.
.
[**2185-8-3**] CXR Decrease in lung volumes with superimposed
mild-to-moderate
volume overload. Repeat radiography following appropriate
diuresis
recommended to assess for underlying infection.
.
[**2185-8-4**]: CXR: In comparison with study of [**2185-8-3**], there is
persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette _____ the
patient following CABG procedure. There is a breakage of the
upper portion of the two most superior sutures, as on the study
of [**2185-8-3**]. Evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure
persists with bibasilar atelectasis, especially in the
retrocardiac region. Dense calcification is seen in the region
of the mitral valve. Right IJ catheter tip again extends to the
lower portion of the SVC.
.
[**2185-8-5**] CXR: Improved pulmonary edema and lower lobe atelectasis.
Stable mild cardiomegaly. Rounded calcification projected over
the mitral valve,on review of a prior CT confirms this
calcification is in/attached to the mitral valve, Correlation
with echo is recommended.
.
[**8-6**] CT Abd: 1. Contained gallbladder perforation into the right
lobe of the liver. Cholelithiasis. 2. Atrophy of the interpolar
left kidney. Atherosclerotic changes of the left renal artery,
not well assessed on this non-angiographic study. 3. Fibroid
uterus.
.
[**8-10**] GB DRAINAGE,INTRO PERC TRANHEP BIL US: 1. Successful CT and
ultrasound-guided placement of percutaneous cholecystostomy
catheter. Approximately 130 cc of
