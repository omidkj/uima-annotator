History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 y/o male with a complicated medical history
including CAD, CRI, PVD, who recently had a strangulated ventral
hernia in [**3-5**] s/p small bowel resections x 2, c/b PNA and
respiratory failure requiring a trach, recently here at [**Hospital1 18**]
SICU from [**Date range (1) 13342**]/07 for PNA and worsening respiratory status,
who now presents from [**Hospital1 **] with melena and ARF. He was
treated for MRSA PNA and pseudomonas UTI with Linezolid and
Cefepime during that hospitalization. His respiratory status
stabilized and he also had trach change to improve his air leark
during that time. He was subsequently discharged to [**Hospital1 **] in
stable condition.
.
While at [**Hospital1 **], he was noted to have melena for the last [**6-6**]
days. However, he has been getting PRBCs transfusions since
[**2138-5-6**], receiving a total of 10 U since being there. He was also
noted to have worsening renal function and anuria for the last
few days. Per patient's wife, [**Name (NI) **] was adequate until 3-4 days
ago when it seemed to become dark and volume decreased. He
suffered a Hct drop to 27.7 [**5-23**] from 30 on [**5-20**], and was given
6 U PRBCs. He received another 2 U PRBCs this morning prior to
transfer and had a Hct of 27.8 prior to transfer. BUN/Cr at
rehab today are 175/4.8, elevated from 64/1.1 at the beginning
of [**Month (only) 116**]. His creatinine has risen from 1.4 on [**5-15**] to 2.0 on [**5-20**]
to 2.3 on [**5-21**]. His linezolid and cefepime course ended on
[**2138-5-7**], although he appears to have received a one-time dose of
Vancomycin on [**5-21**] for MRSA in sputum. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of his melena and ARF today and
prior to transfer, received 2 U PRBCs. Hct on transfer was 27.8.

.
In ED, VS were Tc 95.8, BP 150/41, HR 68, RR 24, SaO2 96%/trach
mask. He was noted to have small amount of melena, guiac+, NG
lavage negative. He received 1 L NS and 40 mg IV protonix.
.
ROS - patient reports feeling tired generally. +loose stool x
several days with nausea. No f/c/s, no CP/SOB. No abdominal
pain. +burning in penile area.

[**5-30**] EKG (per ED read, not available to me) - Afib, HR 60s, LBBB,
LAD
.
[**5-30**] Renal u/s - Unremarkable son[**Name (NI) 493**] appearance of the
kidneys. No evidence of stone or hydronephrosis.
.
[**6-2**] CXR: Comparison with [**2138-6-1**], 16:13 p.m. Pulmonary
vascular congestion has slightly improved. Bilateral pleural
effusions, right moderate and left small, are slightly improved,
as is the lateral lower lobe atelectasis. Cardiac shadow remains
enlarged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.
.
EGD: no active bleeding.  [**Last Name (un) 865**] esophogus, stomach and
duodenum were normal


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old male with multiple medical problems, including
respiratory failure and recent surgery for a ventral hernia, who
was admitted to the MICU for melena and renal failure.  His
hospital course is discussed by problem.
.
# GIB - concern for UGIB given melena, prior h/o Barrett's with
gastritis, although NG lavage negative. DDx included gastritis,
PUD, AVM's, etc.  The patient was transfused PRBCs as needed to
keep his hct above 25.  GI was consulted and he underwent an EGD
which showed no active bleeding, but Barrett's esophagus.  Given
that his hematocrit was stable since admission after only 2 U
PRBCs, he had no further evidence of active bleeding, and he was
initiating hemodialysis, it was thought that a colonoscopy
should be deferred to outpatient management.  It is recommended
that he obtain this 1-2 weeks after discharge.  He was
maintained on a PPI.
.
# Acute on CRI - appeared to be intrinsic renal given FeNa of 6%
and urine Na of 30. Likely ATN in the setting of recent GIB and
given granular casts on sediment. Renal u/s without
hydronephrosis.  The renal team was consulted and it was decided
to initiate hemodialysis.  A tunnelled catheter was placed on
[**2138-6-3**] and HD was started on the same day.  He was continued on
Epogen for his anemia. He has thus far completed 4 sessions of
dialysis, last session of HD was [**Date Range 2974**] [**2138-6-6**]. After this, he
should be on a regular HD schedule of Monday, Wednesday, [**Month/Day/Year 2974**].

.
# AG Metabolic acidosis - most likely in setting of acute renal
failure, although per DC summary, the patient had been on bicarb
tabs in the past.  His bicarb was monitored without any
intervention necessary.
.
# Positive u/a - given recent UTI with Pseudomonas, he was
started on Cefepime.  This was later discontinued once his
cultures returned negative.  He remained afebrile without a
leukocytosis.
.
# Respiratory failure - occurred in setting of surgical history,
PNA, and failure to wean. Complicated by recent MRSA PNA. On PS
[**10-3**] at rehab overnight.  He was started on trach collar trials
after HD on [**2138-6-3**].  Sputum cultures continued to show MRSA and
GNRs, however he did not have a fever, leukocytosis, change in
sputum production, or significant chest x-ray findings to
suggest a new infiltrate or infection.  Therefore, no
antibiotics were administered after the initial Cefepime.
.
# h/o recent strangulated hernia - abdominal wound with
granulation tissue, healing by secondary intention.  The trauma
surgery team followed him while he was hospitalized, continued
with collagenase dressing [**Hospital1 **], this was changed to Accuzyme
dressings daily.
.
# DM - His blood sugars were controlled with standing NPH and
RISS
.
# HTN - his anti-hypertensives were held in the setting in the
of a GIB, however his blood pressure normalized and he then
became hypertensive.  Hydralazine and Imdur were started for
control, and these may be titrated for better control.
.
# F/E/N - He was initially kept NPO, then tube feeds were
resumed once there was no further evidence of GI bleed.  He was
evaluated by speech and swallow and cleared for pureed foods,
thickened liquids as tolerated, but primary nutrition and
medications were still administered through the Dobbhoff tube.
.
# PPx - The patient was maintained on pneumoboo
