Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for MRSA bacteremia/?endocarditis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left internal jugular central venous line placement ([**2171-2-6**])

History of Present Illness:
53 year old male with past medical history significant for
marginal zone non Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p splenectomy [**2169-12-28**]
and rituximab with post-op course complicated by gastric
perforation. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
hospital in Novemember [**2170**] for generalize weakness and
discharge without any cause of his weakness.
.
He recently moved to Massachussets from [**State 2748**] so his
sister could take care of him. He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
on [**2171-2-3**] after five days of worsening fatigue, moaning,
agitation and fall with a head trauma on [**2171-2-3**]. On admission,
VS noted to have a T of 100.3, Cre of 2 (baseline 1.8-1.9), WBC
of 32, Hct of 30, Trop-I of 0.052, BNP of 15,000. Tox screen
positive for opiates.
.
He was noted to have MRSA in his blood cultures with concern for
aortic valve endocarditis. He was initially started on
Vancomycin and oxacillin which was switched to Vancomycin 1500
mg IV BID and rifampin once it was confirmed to be MRSA. He had
a CT torso/head
that did not show any clear abscesses. His hospital course was
notable for acute kidney injury which was initally oliguric but
improved with intravenous hydration. He was intubated on
[**2171-2-5**] for worsening mental status and agitation. CT head
without contrast did not show any acute intracranial pathology.
ABG was 7.48/32/74/24 on 2 L NC prior to intubation.
.
ABG on transfer was AC 500 x 16 40% FiO2 PEEP 5 =
7.39/32/149/19. Hct 20.6 prior to transfer and received 1 U
PRBCs.
.
On the floor, patient was intubated and sedated.

Past Medical History:
1. Splenic marginal zone lymphoma
- s/p splenectomy in [**12/2169**]
- post-op course complicated by atrial fibrillation/sick sinus
syndrome/reentral atrial tachycardia, gastric tear requiring
re-exploration and repair of gastric perforation, post-operative
pancreatitis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia requiring
prednisone.
2. CAD s/p MI
- s/p cardiac cath with no abnormalities
- TTE [**3-/2170**]: EF 60%, normal systolic function, mild TR,
borderline PAH, mild MR, trivial pericardial effusion
3. Rheumatoid arthritis controlled with prednisone
4. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome c/b DVT in [**2158**]
- was on coumadin, currently on aspirin
5. GER
6. Sleep apnea
7. Hepatitis C
8. h/o loculate pleural effusion
9. s/p pancreatic stent
[**70**].Vitamin B12 deficiency
11. Chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.5)
12. ?HIT


Social History:
The patient still lives at home. Divorced and has been depending
on his care by his ex-wife and son. Recently moved to
[**State 350**] so his sister could take care of him.  Ambulates
with a walker but has become more dependent on others for care
recently.  He recently started smoking.  No clear history of
increased alcohol abuse and no drug history.

Family History:
Positive for a father who died from colon cancer at the age of
55.  His mother died from head and neck cancer at age 59.
Multiple other siblings with cancers and a sister with
splenectomy also after a non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Physical Exam:
VS:  98.6 92 121/70 96% 40%FiO2 PEEP 5 cm

appreciate it radiating to the axilla. No gallops
ABD:  Soft, nontender and nondistended. NABS
EXT:  No edema
SKIN:  B/l stasis dermatitis.  Chronic skin changes at b/l UE.

IMAGING:
CT head showed no acute intracranial pathology but this was the
motion degraded study. CT of the cervical spine:  No cervical
spine fracture, subluxation or prevertebral soft tissue
swelling; however, the DJD changes at C5-C6 place the patient at
a greater risk for cord injury and if needed an MRI could be
obtained.
.
Chest x-ray:  There is a right upper lobe opacity that
potentially may represent an area of aspiration versus
contusion, although definitive developing infectious process
cannot be entirely excluded.
.
hip x-ray showed no fracture.
.
Pelvic x-ray:  No pelvic fractures.

.
CT torso showed infiltrates and effusions at both lung bases,
small  amount of ascites.  He is status post splenectomy.  No
obvious intra-abdominal abnormality.
.
TTE ([**2171-2-5**]): LVEF of 50%. Moderate vegetation at aortic
valve.
