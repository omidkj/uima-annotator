Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest. Small
secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Moderately depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional left ventricular wall motion findings
as shown below; remaining LV segments contract normally.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Mildly dilated
descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The patient was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data


REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. On manipulation
of the blood pressure, the MR was 3+ at a systolic pressure of
150 mmHg. There is a central jet with bileaflet retraction and a
globular shape of the LV cavity.
On bypass: The ASD by inspection shows multiple perforations of
the septum. On review of the clips, there are two distinct areas
of transseptal left-to-right flow in the membranous portion.

POST-BYPASS: Epi, phenylephrine, amiodarone infusion. There is a
well-seated annular ring of the mitral valve with no mitral
regurgitation seen. Biventricular systolic function is slightly
improved on inotropic support with LVEF 35%. Areas of wall
motion abnormalities are unchanged post-CPB.There is no ASD seen
by color Doppler and by Bubble Study. Aortic contours are normal
post-decannulation.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**12-25**] where he underwent a
CABG x 2, MVRepair, and ASD closure. He was transferred to the
SICU in critical but stable condition. He was extubated and
weaned from his vasoactive drips that evening. He was
transferred to the floor on POD #1. He continued to do well
postoperatively. He was diuresed toward his preop weight and
began to increase his activity level. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were removed without incident. Cleared for discharge to
home with services on POD # 6. Pt. is to make all follow-up
appts. as per discharge instructions.
