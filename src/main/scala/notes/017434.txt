Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical ICU on [**2122-8-6**] for
evaluation and treatment of chronic respiratory failure.

tracheostomy tube #8 was placed; she had therapeutic aspiration
with flexible bronchoscopy; and, her stoma was revised. Her
postoperative course was uneventful. She remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable. Her pain was well-controlled.

on bronchoscopy, the stent was correctly positioned with minimal
to moderate secretions; The distal airways were patent and
minimal secretions; the ultrasound revealed minimal pleural
