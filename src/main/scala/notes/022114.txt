Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfonamides / Dicloxacillin / Becaplermin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
R shoulder pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 87 yo F with MMP including CAD s/p NSTEMI [**1-21**]
s/p POBA of LAD, CHF (EF 25-30% on TTE [**3-23**]), critical AS s/p
valvuloplasty [**3-23**], atrial fibrillation, s/p PPM for SSS and h/o
VT who presents with R shoulder pain and found to have an
elevated troponin. The patient first began to notice R sided
shoulder pain this past weekend. The pain is worse with
movement, constant, and is a [**2153-3-20**]. No shoulder swelling,
overlying redness. She denies h/o trauma, heavy lifting, and has
not had prior similar R shoulder pain. Denies chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**] but does report a history of
stable 3 pillow orthopnea. No PND, no worsening LE edema.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt AF, BP 119/86, HR 78, RR 22, O2 sat 92% RA. EKG
with a-v pacing, widened QRS, ST/T wave abnls but unchanged from
prior EKG on [**2151-3-27**]. CXR with tiny R pleural effusion and
changes suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension, R
shoulder x-ray without dislocation or fractures. Troponin
elevated to 0.22 from 0.05 on [**3-28**], CK 128, MB 8. The patient
received tylenol and aspirinr and was admitted to medicine for
further care.
.
Currently the patient continues to deny CP, SOB, palpitations,
lightheadedness, and diaphoresis. Continued R shoulder pain, but
improved from prior. Repeat cardiac enzymes revealed troponin
0.29, CK 111, MB 11, MBI 9.9. Cardiology called, pt started on
heparin gtt, plavix, high dose statin, beta-blockade.
.
ROS as above. Otherwise negative for fevers, chills, headache,
blurry vision, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
dysuria, constipation, or focal numbness or weakness. Does
report urinary frequency, but this is chronic for the patient
and she attributes this to diuretics.

EKG - a-v sequential pacing @ 70 bpm, LAD, widened QRS, diffuse
ST and T wave changes unchanged from prior on [**2151-3-27**].
.
CXR - There is no change in cardiomegaly with left ventricular
configuration. There is central pulmonary arterial prominence
consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The aorta again

demonstrates calcifications. There is likely a tiny right
pleural effusion, although lack of lateral view makes
confirmation difficult. However, no focal airspace consolidation
is identified in either lung to cause concern for infectious
pneumonia. There is no change in a left chest dual-lead pacer
with intact leads projecting over the right atrium and right
ventricle. The bony thorax is notable only for degenerative
changes of the thoracic spine.
.
R shoulder x-ray - The right shoulder is held in internal
rotation. This study is limited by lack of external rotation or
axillary views. However, no fracture or dislocation is
identified. There are
mild degenerative changes involving the acromioclavicular and
glenohumeral joints. No radiodense foreign body or soft tissue
calcification is identified.
.
TTE [**3-23**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated but quite
elongated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.4
cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral
stenosis due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac cath [**3-23**] - 1. One vessel coronary artery disease. (Left
main 10%, prox LAD 10%, mid LAD 60%, distal LAD 30% occlusion,
LCx no disease, RCA not injected known to be chronically
occluded).
2. Critical aortic stenosis
3. Successful aortic valvuloplasty


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 87 yo F with h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI [**2149**], afib, systolic CHF,
SSS and h/o VT s/p PPM who presents with R shoulder pain and
NSTEMI.
.
#) Cardiac -
I: Admitted with NSTEMI. Initially with elevated troponin to
0.22, flat CKs. On repeat, troponin rose to 0.29, CK MB and MBI
elevated to 11 and 9.9 respectively. EKG essentially
non-diagnostic given a-v pacing. Pt currently clinically stable
denying symptoms of CP although did have episode of
assymptomatic hypotension in ED that responded to 500 cc bolus.
Recent cath [**3-23**] revealed 60% mid LAD disease, site of prior
POBA. Also has known occlusion of RCA.  Heparin gtt was
continued for 48 hours for medical management; ASA and plavix
given.  Cardiology consulted with recommendation for medical
managment.  High dose statin continued; short acting metoprolol
given.  ACEI initially continued.  Developed shoulder/?chest
pain a few hours after heparin turned off; ECG still AV paced
but with altered precordial axis (lateral leads downgoing) of
unclear significance; thus restarted and patient given SL NTG
x1.  Patient hypotensive the following day as detailed below;
recommend no SLNTG in future.  With hypotensive episode, enzymes
further cycled but were
