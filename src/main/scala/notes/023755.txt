Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Sulfur / Loperamide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
right sided weakness, difficulty speaking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intravenous TPA

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo RH F who was apparently well until 10am this morning when
she had the acute onset of difficulty speaking and right
face/arm weakness. By her arrival here, her right arm had
returned to [**Location 213**] - she denies weakness - but she still cannot
speak. Denies headache, numbness. At baseline, she is demented
and lives in a home.

Recent OMR notes comment on a self-increase on lasix to 80mg
daily due to increasing peripheral edema and shortness of
breath. This was decreased back to 60mg daily when she was found
to be orthostatic and complaining of light-headedness.

ROS: On review of systems, the pt denied recent fever or chills.
 No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied cough,
shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
 No dysuria.  Denied arthralgias or myalgias. Denied rash.

---
On discharge: Pt has normal cranial nerves other than a mild
right facial asymmetry.  She has full strength, but a right PD.
Coordination normal. Sensation normal. Speech is just barely
fluent, and comprehension is normal.  She is alert and oriented
and has good insight.

CT BRAIN PERFUSION  [**2129-2-2**] 11:56 AM
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema,
mass, mass effect, or acute infarction. Periventricular
hypodensities correspond to chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.

CTA HEAD: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major
branches are patent with no evidence of stenoses. The distal
cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5 mm in diameter on
the left and 5 mm in diameter on the right. There is no evidence
of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.

PERFUSION STUDY: In the distribution of the inferior division of
the left MCA, there is increased mean transit time and decreased
cerebral blood flow in a pattern that demonstrates no
perfusion/diffusion mismatch when compared to concurrently
performed MRI. Incidental note is made of a diminutive B4 branch
of the right vertebral artery. There is also beam hardening
artifact causing apparent filling defect in the left proximal
ICA, which is seen to be secondary to artifact.

IMPRESSION: 1) Irreversible ischemia in the distribution of the
inferior division of the left MCA. 2) No vascular stenosis or
occlusion. 3) Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

MRI/MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2129-2-2**] 2:53 PM
FINDINGS: There is a small focus in a portion of the territory
of the inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery,
which demonstrates abnormal high signal on the ADC map.
Corresponding hyperintensities on T2 and FLAIR demonstrate this
to be an evolving subacute infarct. There is no abnormal vessel
cut-off, no evidence of vascular stenosis or occlusion, and no
evidence of hemorrhage. Periventricular hyperintensity on T2
imaging is likely indicative of chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.

IMPRESSION: Evolving subacute infarct of a portion of the
inferior division of the left MCA territory.

Echocardiogram-
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small posterior pericardial effusion.

FOREARM (AP & LAT) SOFT TISSUE RIGHT  [**2129-2-3**] 10:05 AM
Two portable radiographs of the right forearm were obtained and
there are no prior studies for comparison.

The bones are diffusely demineralized. No displaced fractures
are noted. There are severe degenerative changes of the first
CMC joint and triscaphe joint. No soft tissue calcification is
seen.

IMPRESSION: No displaced fracture. Severe first CMC and
triscaphe joint degenerative change. Severe osteopenia.

CT head [**2-4**]:
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage or mass effect. Subtle hypodensity in
the posterior inferior portion of the left frontal lobe
