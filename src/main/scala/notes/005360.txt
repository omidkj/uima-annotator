1:23 AM


CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 78425**]

FINDINGS: There is no cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
Known right
occipital bone fracture, and bilateral occipital condyle
fractures are better
evaluated and described in detail on concurrently performed head
CT.

There is mild straightening of normal cervical lordosis which
may be due to
positioning and cervical collar. Endotracheal tube is in place,
with some
inspissated secretions in the pharynx. Small amount of air is
noted
posterior and adjacent to the left clavicle, prevertebral and
paraspinal
soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable. Visualized outline of
the thecal sac
appears normal, but please note that CT is unable to provide
intrathecal
detail comparable to MRI.

IMPRESSION: No cervical spine fracture or malalignment.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery was
consulted urgently due to the brain injury. He was loaded with
Dilantin 1 g and started on 100 mg TID and was also given 100 g
Mannitol at bedside. Serial head CT scans were followed and were
stable. A port ion of his skull was removed and will be replaced
at a later date by Neurosurgery. He was fitted with a helmet and
this will need to be worn at all times.

He remained in the Trauma ICU for over a week intubated and
sedated. A tracheostomy, PEG and IVC filter were placed on [**6-14**].
Tube feedings were initiated. His sedation was weaned and he was
very restless requiring Ativan and Haldol. He was able to be
weaned from the ventilator. The Ativan was eventually stopped
and he was started on standing Haldol. There has been marked
improvement in his mental status.

His tracheostomy was removed on [**6-21**] and a bedside evaluation
was done; his diet was advanced and he is tolerating this
without any difficulties.

Social work has been closely involved with patient and his
family throughout his hospital stay provided emotional support.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended [**Hospital **] rehab after acute hospital stay.
