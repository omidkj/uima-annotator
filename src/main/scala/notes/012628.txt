DISCHARGE LABORATORY STUDIES:
 - INR 2.1
 - WBC 7.1 Hct 31.4

Radiology:
[**11-26**] CXR: The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral
interstitial opacities. Also noted are mild bibasilar opacities.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are normal. An ET tube terminates
appropriately 4.1 cm above the carina. A NG tube terminates in
the stomach. There is a small left pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema. Small left pleural
effusion. Mild bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis,
aspiration, and/or pneumonia.

[**11-27**] TTE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**12-5**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Persistent
opacities
within the lower lungs likely representing a combination of
pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation.
As compared to the recent study, the right lower lobe has
slightly worsened with increased obscuration of the right
hemidiaphragm. Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be
helpful to more fully evaluate this region when the patient's
condition permits, particularly to exclude a developing
pneumonia at this site.

[**12-6**] CT head: In the left parietal and left frontal regions,
there is loss of the normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation,
with areas of hypoattenuation compatible with edema from
subacute infarction. There is extensive periventricular
hypodensity, most compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic
changes.  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, masses, or mass
effect. There is no midline shift or herniation. The ventricles
and sulci are prominent, most compatible with atrophic change.
There is no acute fracture. The visualized portions of the
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. The
patient is status post bilateral lens implantation.
IMPRESSION: Areas of loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation, compatible with areas of subacute infarction
involving the left frontal and parietal regions. MRI can be
obtained for further evaluation as clinically indicated. No
evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

[**12-10**] MRI head: There are several confluent areas of high signal
intensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, consistent with
sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemia. In addition, there
is a focal area of high signal intensity present within the left
frontal lobe which involves the cortical surface and underlying
white matter. The appearances could represent a subacute or
chronic infarct. There is a small focus of slow diffusion within
the left frontal lobe, likely representing an acute infarct.
There is also a chronic left posterior parietal infarct. There
is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Similar foci of
high signal intensity are seen within the cerebellum as well as
the brainstem on T2 and FLAIR images, most consistent with
sequelae of microvascular ischemia. There is mild mucosal
thickening seen in the maxillary sinuses. The remaining
paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable. There is no abnormal
marrow signal.
IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple infarcts of different ages, acute,
subacute and
