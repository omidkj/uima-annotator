History of Present Illness:
This is a 42 year old woman with a history of MS diagnosed in
[**Month (only) 958**] of this year when she had recurrent vertigo. She began to

Microbiology:
Blood cultures [**2164-8-10**]: pending at time of discharge, NGTD

[**2164-7-29**] MRI brain-WAND study
1. Unchanged heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the right
frontal
region with significant edema in the basal ganglia and mass
effect as
described above.  Fiducial markers are in place.
2. Unchanged right cerebellar enhancing lesion with mild
vascular enhancement, adjacent to the cerebellar nodule on the
right, possibly consistent with a developmental venous anomaly,
a second lesion in this region cannot be completely ruled out.

CT head [**2164-7-29**]
 A large right frontotemporal mass with extensive surrounding
vasogenic edema and mass effect and leftward shift of midline
structures to approximately 8 mm.  Subfalcine and uncal
herniation.  The above findings in conjunction with the prior
MRI are concerning for a tumefactive multiple sclerosis or a
primary malignant tumor (including primary versus secondary).
The above findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3742**], at
approximately 1:30 a.m. and immediately after the CT study.

[**2164-8-3**] MRI Brain: 1. Limited study for surgigal planning
showing mild interval improvement in the ring-enhancing mass in
the left frontal lobe with reduction in degree of mass effect.
2. Relatively stable appearance of right cerebellar enhancing
focus,
suggesting multifocal disease.

[**2164-8-3**] CT head postop: IMPRESSION:
1.  Pneumocephalus and small amount of acute blood products in
the right
frontal region after biopsy.
2.  Right frontotemporal edema due to large mass with subfalcine
herniation, better-delineated on MRI of earlier today. Mild
effacement of the right perimesencephalic cisterns is improved
from [**2164-7-29**].

[**2164-8-9**] Chest X-ray (PA and lat)
CONCLUSION:  New airspace consolidation at the base of both
lungs, but more
prominent in the right lower lobe, suggestive of multifocal
pneumonia or
aspiration.

[**2164-8-9**] LENI's:
IMPRESSION:
Deep venous thrombosis within the left gastrocnemius and soleus
veins.

[**2164-8-11**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic process.
3.  Bilateral lower lobe consolidative opacities, right greater
than left,
possibly secondary to compressive atelectasis given the adjacent
pleural
effusions, although infection or aspiration could have a similar
appearance.
3.  Small quantity of sludge within the gallbladder.  No
associated
gallbladder wall thickening to suggest acute cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 42 yo female with a history of multiple
sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, and asthma who presented with a
rapid decline in strength and level of consciousness and found
to have Primary CNS B cell lymphoma after stereotactic brain
biopsy. Her course was complicated by DVT, probable PE, and
pneumonia.

Active Diagnoses:
# Primary CNS B cell lymphoma: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transfered from
[**Hospital 8641**] Hospital to the NSICU. Her MRI was entered into our
system. She was on Decadron for cerebral edema. Her speech
became more slurred during the night and Decadron was increased
to 10mg Q6 hours. Mannitol was started. CT head was done to rule
out hemorrhage as her exam was dramatically worse then what was
portrayed in the transfer notes. It was negative for hemorrhage
but showed a frontotemporal mass.  She was started on Dilantin
on the neurology service given seizure at OSH. With medical
management her exam improved with less weakness on her left.
Neuromedicine requested a biopsy due to the fact that review of
OSH records revealed an LP that did not suggest MS. They were
concerned for tumor. On the night of [**8-2**], she was taken to the
OR on [**8-3**] for a stereotactic brain biopsy.  Preliminary
pathology was reviewed with Heme-Path and thought to be primary
CNS B-cell lymphoma. Postoperative CT head demonstrated mild
pneumocephalus and small amount of acute blood products in the
area of the biopsy. Patient was transferred to the Neuro-SDU.
Her exam remained stable. On [**8-4**], patient was transferred to
the floor.  She continued on high dose steroids.  Over the next
several days her exam improved with improvement of her left
facial droop and left-sided weakness. She was transitioned from
Dilantin to Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. Her dexamethasone
was tapered to dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily without further
taper for the next week
