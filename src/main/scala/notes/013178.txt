embolization to the right internal iliac artery which he
tolerated well.  He now returns for an endovascular aneurysm
repair.

1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Hepatitis.
4.  Chronic low back pain.
5.  Right hip pain.
6.  Echocardiogram in [**2161**] showed left atrial dilatation,
left ventricular hypertrophy, with normal systolic function.
7.  Electrocardiogram and stress in [**2161**] was without
electrocardiogram changes.
8.  He has a history of peptic ulcer disease with symptoms
over six to eight years.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Transurethral resection of prostate in [**2158**].
2.  A cystoscopy in [**2158**] and [**2155**].
3.  Hemorrhoidectomy in [**2154**].
4.  Appendectomy in [**2130**].

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Darvon, Effexor 2.25 mg p.o. q.d.,
Xanax 1 mg p.o. p.r.n., Cardura 4 mg p.o. at bedtime.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 166/86, pulse 75,
respirations 20.  The general appearance revealed an
overweight Russian-speaking gentleman in no acute distress.
His HEENT examination was unremarkable.  His heart had a
regular rate and rhythm, distant heart sounds.  No extra
murmur, rubs or gallops.  Chest revealed distant lungs sounds
bilaterally in all lung fields.  No adventitious sounds.
Abdomen was round, soft, and nontender.  No bruits were
noted.  No organomegaly was noted.  The abdominal aorta was
not prominent.  The extremities showed edema bilaterally with
palpable posterior tibialis pulses.


PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY:  Hematocrit of 41.5, creatinine 1.5,
PT and INR were normal.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed inverted T
waves in I, aVL, V5, and V6; unchanged from [**2158**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is now admitted endovascular
abdominal aortic repair.  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area.  On [**2163-7-26**], he underwent an
endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair without
incident.  He was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit
in stable condition with dopplerable dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibialis bilaterally.

Postoperatively, he remained hemodynamically stable.  His
postoperative hematocrit was 34.6.  His BUN was 16,
creatinine 1.5, potassium 4.2, magnesium 2.2.  He had a
palpable dorsalis pedis bilaterally.  Bowel sounds were
present.  Lungs were clear to auscultation.  He continued to
do well and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit for continued monitoring and care.

Vascular on call was called to see the patient at 3:30 a.m.
on postoperative day one for complaints of chest pain.  Vital
signs were blood pressure of 121/51, pulse 72, respiratory
rate 19, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.  Lung examination
and cardiac examination were unremarkable.  Abdomen remained
soft and nontender.  Pulse examination remained unchanged.
An electrocardiogram was obtained.  There were no acute
ischemic electrocardiogram changes.  Serial creatine kinase,
MB, and electrocardiogram were obtained.  Electrolytes were
obtained.  Hematocrit was obtained.  Results revealed
hematocrit was stable at 31.8.  Electrolytes showed a
potassium of 5.1, BUN 19, creatinine 1.5, ionized
calcium 1.12.  Creatine kinase total was 1400.  MBs were 16,
10, and 7.  Troponin was less than 0.3.  Serial
electrocardiograms returned to baseline.  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable with a temperature maximum
of 101.2.  Incentive spirometry was begun.  Perioperative
Kefzol was continued.  He remained in the Vascular Intensive
Care Unit.

On postoperative day two he defervesced.  He ruled out for
myocardial infarction and was delined and transferred to the
regular nursing floor.  His Foley was discontinued, but the
patient failed to void and required the Foley to be replaced.
On the day of transfer he had a temperature maximum of 100.4
to 98.7.  Groin dressings were clean, dry and intact.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Foley was in
place.  Culture and sensitivity and urinalysis were sent for
evaluation.  The patient was continued on Kefzol.  Urology
was consulted with regard to failure to void in a patient
with known transurethral resection of prostate.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was evaluated by Physical
Therapy and felt that he would benefit from a short stay in
rehabilitation for increasing endurance and mobility.  The
patient was requested to be screened by Transitional Care
Unit.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Cardura 4 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Ancef 1 g intravenous q.8.h.
 3.  Percocet tablets one to two tablets q.4h. p.r.n. for
pain.
 4.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
 5.  Ocean Spray to both nostrils p.r.n.
 6.  Xanax 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
 7.  Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
 8.  Dulcolax suppository p.r.n.
 9.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10.  Dulcolax tablets 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
2.  Status post endovascular stent.
3.  Fever secondary to unclear etiology; urine and culture
and sensitivity pending at the time of dictation.
4.  Failure to void with a history of transurethral resection
of prostate; Genitourinary consulted.
