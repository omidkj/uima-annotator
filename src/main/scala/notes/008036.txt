Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization and myocardial biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28418**] is a 59 year old male with extensive medical
history, pertinent for diastolic CHF (EF 50%) NYHA class III,
DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, sinus node dysfunction with PPM 4.03,
sarcoidosis and MGUS, who presented for right heart
catheterization and cardiac biopsy secondary to heart failure
poorly responsive to medical management.

The patient has had multiple admissions for CHF, the last of
which was in [**9-8**] at which time he had approximately 13 L of
fluid removed by CHF Solutions ultrafiltration machine.  Since
discharge he has been followed closely by [**Hospital 1902**] clinic and
undergoing biweekly nesiritide infusions, however his symptoms
have continued to worsen.  He has dyspnea with minimal exertion
(can walk approximately 20 feet) which has been progressive
since [**9-8**], but notably worse over the week prior to admission.
 He has also had a 12 pound weight gain over the 2 months prior
to admission.  He had PFTs and further pulmonary workup that was
negative.  A catheterization in [**12-8**] did not demonstrate CAD,
thought he did have moderate biventricular diastolic
dysfunction, and mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.

He is now admitted for right heart catheterization for
evaluation of hemodynamics, with myocardial biopsy to evaluate
for infiltrative disease, in addition to tailored therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old male with complicated medical history, including
severe diastolic CHF, HTN, DM2, sarcoidosis and MGUS, who
presents to the CCU s/p right heart catheterization with RV
biopsy today for workup of worsening dyspnea on exertion out of
proportion to echo findings.  Markedly elevated bilateral
filling pressures on cath, and mildly decreased CI.

1) Dyspnea on exertion:  Pt. with symptoms of severe CHF despite
normal EF and negative pulmonary workup, without pulmonary edema
on most CXRs that have been done thus far.  Given his markedly
elevated filling pressures bilaterally and mildly decreased CI,
he was treated for CHF with aggressive afterload reduction and
diuresis with natrecor, lasix drip, diuril prn, and bumex 4 mg
po bid.  On this regimen we diuresed him 6.5 liters negative
(for his short hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 28419**]).  With diuresis,
his pulmonary artery diastolic pressures decreased from 30-32 to
20-22, his cardiac index improved from 2.0 at cath to 2.7, and
his SVR was 700-900.  Cardiac biopsy to exclude amyloid or
sarcoid pathology is pending from [**12-31**].

2) Hyperlipidemia:  Continued fibrate and zetia.

3) DM:  Unclear home insulin dose as patient did not recall and
unclear from notes. We continued sliding scale insulin and he
will continue on his regimen at home.

4) CRI:  Creatinine remained at baseline (3.7 to 4.0).

5) LLE ulcers:  He continued to finish a week of augmentin
prescribed as an outpatient for the ulcers.  He was renally
dosed.

6) Hypothyroidism:  Continued synthroid.

7) Neuropathy:  Renally dosed neurontin.  Percocet PRN.

8) FEN:  Electrolytes were closely monitored in the setting of
aggressive diuresis. He ate [**Doctor First Name **], low Na diet and was fluid
restricted to 1.5L daily.

9) PPx: SQ heparin.
