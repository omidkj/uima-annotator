Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Gangrene of the right foot

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2110-1-21**] Right popliteal to dorsalis pedis artery bypass
with non reversed right lesser saphenous vein and angioscopy.


History of Present Illness:
This 84-year-old gentleman has gangrene involving the lateral
aspect of his right foot. He had an arteriogram which showed
occlusion of his anterior tib and
posterior tibial arteries over a long distance. His peroneal
artery was opened but was diseased distally and he reconstituted
a small caliber dorsalis pedis artery. Vein mapping showed a
saphenous vein patent from the groin to the
calf. He had the distal vein harvested for CABG before.

fraction of 20-25%; s/p CABG [**2103**] LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM and SVG-RCA

besides was delaying CABG for 2-3 weeks to get affairs in order

Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. The right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= XX %). The estimated
cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). The
calculated myocardial performance index was0.9 (MPI A = 602 ms;
MPI B = 330 ms). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade
III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**2110-1-21**] Admitted direct via holding room for a scheduled LE

2/19-20/09 No acute events. Continues LEBP pathway. Diet
advanced. Art line and foley d/c'd, central line switched to
PIV. Physical therapy evaluation, touch down WB on R, FWD on L.

2/21-22/09 No acute events. Continues LEBP pathway. had some
problems w/ [**Name2 (NI) 34279**]-given on Bisacodyl and given fleet
enema. Became floor status. Pain management still an issue.
Having breakthrough pain requiring IV pain medications.

[**2110-1-27**] No acute events. Urine output scant, and unable to take
in large po fluids, given IV fluid bolus. Out of bed w/ assist.
Pain meds converted to PO.

[**2110-1-28**]
