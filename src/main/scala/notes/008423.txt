History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 94500**] is an 83 year-old male with a history of atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin therapy, CAD status post angioplasty in
[**2094**]/[**2095**], HTN and DM type 2, with a prior 4-unit GI bleed in
[**2102**] while on Coumadin with work-up remarkable for antral
polyps, [**Last Name (un) 865**] esophagus, C-scope with colonic polyps without
bleeding, and negative capsule endoscopy, who now returns with a
1-day history of "black stools". Of note, he was transfused 1
unit of PRBCs in [**3-/2105**] at the time of his CEA for Hct 23.4,
and was transfused an additional 2 units of PRBCs last week at
[**Hospital 4068**] hospital, Hct unclear.

He reports some constipation over the past few days. He moved
his bowels yesterday morning, brown stools, with some straining.
He subsequently had one loose BM with dark stools on the toilet
paper, and another BM with black stools with some bright blood
in the toilet. He then decided to seek medical attention. He
describes transient lightheadedness last night, resolved. No
chest pain (he never had chest pain, prior cardiac presentations
with dizziness), no shortness of breath. No N/V. No abdominal
pain. No fever or chills at home. No history of EtOH. No NSAIDs.
He remains on ASA and Coumadin daily. ROS negative for weight
loss.

In ED, T 98.9, HR 98, BP 99/52, RR 18. Sat 99% on RA. An NG
lavage was performed, which was negative (no return of bile).
DRE with maroon-colored stools. INR returned at 1.9, and he was
given Vitamin K 5 mg SC X1, and FFP X2 units. His hematocrit
also returned at 26.5, and he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs,
without improvement and with further drop in Hct to 23. 2
additional units were given (ongoing at time of transfer). GI
was consulted. While in the ED, he had a large loose BM with
[**Last Name (un) 30212**] stools. He remained hemodynamically stable. He is being
admitted to the ICU for further management.

EKG in ED: Atrial fibrillation, rate 114 bpm, LAD, old LAFB and

Relevant imaging data:
[**2105-6-11**] Colonoscopy: Normal mucosa in the whole colon.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.

[**2105-6-11**] SMALL BOWEL ENTEROSCOPY: A small size hiatal hernia was
seen. A salmon colored mucosa distributed in a localized
pattern, suggestive of Barrett's Esophagus was found. Many
polyps of benign appearance were found in the stomach body and
antrum. One polyp in the body was ulcerated with stigmata of
recent bleeding. Duodenum: Protruding lesions. A single
pedunculated polyp with stigmata of recent bleeding was found in
the proximal bulb. It was observed prolapsing into the stomach
through the pylorus. Jejunum: Normal jejunum. There was no blood
seen to mid jejunum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 94500**] is an 83 year-old male with atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin with INR 1.9, CAD on ASA, DM type 2, with prior GI
bleeding without a clear source identified, admitted to the ICU
with a 1-day history of maroon stools with Hct drop. His
hospital course will be reviewed by problems.

1) GI bleed: As noted above, an NG lavage performed in the ED
was negative for blood, but limited by lack of bilious return.
His hematocrit nadir was 24, and he was admitted to the ICU for
further care. He was transfused a total of 7 units of PRBCs
during his hospital stay, and 3 units of FFP for emergent
reversal of Warfarin. Vitamin K was also administered. His ASA
and coumadin were held on admission. GI was consulted, and a
push enteroscopy was performed on [**2105-6-11**], remarkable for
Barrett's esophagus, and polyps in the antrum and stomach body,
one of which was ulcerated with stigmata of recent bleeding. A
duodenal polyp was also seen prolapsing through the pylorus,
also with stigmata of recent bleeding. A colonoscopy was
unremarkable. It is likely that the ulcerated polyps accounted
for his GI bleeding, although the presentation with
maroon-colored stools and BRBPR with lack of hemodynamic
instability is somewhat unusual. While in the ICU, his bloody
bowel movements resolved (last during bowel prep on [**2105-6-11**] in
AM).

Recommendation was made to proceed with a repeat upper endoscopy
on [**6-16**] (with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 172**] for polypectomy. His ASA and Coumadin
will remain on hold until that time. We will leave it to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 172**] to decide upon timing to resume
anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy. His hematocrit at
discharge was 30.2. He was discharged home from the ICU.

2) CAD: His EKG in the ED was at baseline, and he was ruled out
with serial cardiac biomarkers. His antihypertensives were held
on admission (Enalapril and Diltiazem), as well as ASA. He was
continued on Lipitor. There were no issues during his hospital
stay. Enalapril and Diltiazem were both resumed prior to
discharge.

3) Atrial fibrillation: As noted above, Coumadin was held at the
time of admission. He remained in atrial fibrillation, with
occasional rapid ventricular response to the 110s. His
Diltiazem, which was transiently held, was resumed prior to
discharge. His Coumadin remains on hold at the time of discharge
pending repeat upper endoscopy. The decision to resume
anticoagulation will be left to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 172**].

4) DM type 2: He was placed on a regular insulin sliding scale
in the ICU for glycemic control. His Avandia was resumed prior
to discharge.

5) Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: His creatinine on
admission was 1.5, up from a baseline of 1.2 in 04/[**2104**]. His
creatinine improved with volume expansion, ultimately attributed
to pre-renal azotemia.
