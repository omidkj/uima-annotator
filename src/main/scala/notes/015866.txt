with a history as outlined below who was recently admitted
[**4-29**] until [**2129-5-6**], for bilateral lower extremity
cellulitis and congestive heart failure, who now presents
with respiratory distress, fever and change in mental status.
She had been discharged on Augmentin for cellulitis on [**5-6**].  She was doing well until [**5-9**], when she was found to

decline in mental status.  She was given 80 mg of intravenous
Lasix with 600 cc. of urine output.  She was also given one
gram of Ceftriaxone intravenously at her Nursing Home but
because of continued respiratory distress was sent to the
[**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room and then
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation
for two nights.

In the Emergency Room, she was given Flagyl and intravenous
fluids.  Her arterial blood gases on admission were
7.4/45/78.   White blood cell count was 10.3, 3.6 previously,
and chest x-ray showed new left lower lobe pneumonia.

change from EKG on [**2129-5-3**].

Chest x-ray with left lower lobe infiltrate versus
atelectasis, cardiomegaly, no clear congestive heart failure.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 70 year old woman with congestive
heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and bilateral lower
extremity cellulitis admitted with respiratory distress,
fever and mental status changes, found to have new left lower
lobe pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory:  Her pneumonia was treated with Levofloxacin
and Vancomycin intravenously.  Flagyl was added for one day
on [**5-11**], but then discontinued after one dose, given
the low likelihood for aspiration pneumonia in her.  She was
continued on MDIs and nebulizers and became clinically more
stable with resolving fever and O2 saturation by hospital day
number three.

2.  Infectious Disease:  As above, Levofloxacin and
Vancomycin for both pneumonia and to cover her cellulitis.
She was found to have a new Stage II sacral decubitus ulcer.
Blood cultures with no growth to date.  It was decided not to
ask Plastics to come look at her sacral decubitus ulcer as it
appeared to be superficial and as there is good skin care
nurses at her Nursing Home.

3.  Cardiac:  History of congestive heart failure with low
ejection fraction.  She was on Coumadin for low ejection
fraction.  For some reason this was held at the Nursing Home
perhaps secondary to a super-therapeutic INR.  It was
continued to be held in-house, however, she should restart it
once she is back at Star of [**Doctor Last Name **] with close following of her
INR with goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.  She was continued on her
beta blocker, aspirin, ACE inhibitor and Lasix during her
admission.  She had one episode of transient supraventricular
tachycardia on Telemetry.

4.  Renal / Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:   Renal
function was stable on admission.  Creatinine bumped up to
1.3 on [**5-12**], but on [**5-13**], it was 1.0 again.  She was
likely dehydrated, also because her sodium had risen, and was
given free water boluses gently via her nasogastric tube.
Despite the she continued with peripheral edema, any
hydration was done gently.

Once the patient was taking good p.o. on hospital day number
three, her nasogastric tube was discontinued and free water
was discontinued and she was encouraged to take good p.o.

5.  Endocrine:  Diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism.  She
continued on Regular insulin sliding scale and started on NPH
10 units twice a day and continued on Synthroid.

6.  Mental status:  This improved to her baseline with
resolution of her fever and respiratory distress.

7.  Prophylaxis:  On subcutaneous heparin and proton pump
inhibitor.

8.  Code Status:  FULL.  Her sister is her health care proxy.
