HPI: 57 yo M  with paraplegia, status post MRSA bacteremia (St.
[**Female First Name (un) **]. hosp) likely from R trochanteric decub, tx with
vanc/rifampin x 5 wks, then 84 days of linezolid.
Patient's problems began in early [**Month (only) 958**] of this year, when he
developed fevers to 104 and chills, and presented to [**Hospital 27034**] hospital.  At that time, he was bacteremic with MRSA and
a source for the infection was sought after, with an extensive
negative work up.  This included a Transesophageal
echocardiogram time two, CT of chest /abdomen and pelvis.  He
does have a large right gluteal decubitus ulcer, which was
debrided [**2161-3-8**], and this may have been the presumed
source.  He was treated with vancomycin, as well as rifampin.
He at some point returned to [**Location **] with similar problems, and
was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2161-5-16**] for further mgt of
his persistent fever and MRSA bacteremia.   At [**Hospital3 5097**], he had a
CT scan demonstrating osteomyelitis with destruction of L5-S1.
He was to be continued on vancomycin for a full 12-week course -
however, on [**5-21**] the pt was found to have a pneumonia, so the
vancomycin was stopped and he was begun on a 12-week course of
linezolid instead.  He was discharged from [**Hospital3 5097**], to a rehab
facility, on [**2161-6-11**].
On [**2161-7-23**], the pt presented to [**Hospital3 934**] hospital after
experiencing fever to 103. On admission, his decub ulcer was
noted to extend down to the bone.  He got levofloxacin IV in the
emergency department.  WBC-16.3, Urine culture with > 100
thousand gram negative rods, growing pan-resistant enterbacter
cloace and psuedomonas sensitive to gent only. Started on gent.
blood cultures from [**7-25**] and [**7-26**] with MRSA. CT LS spine/pelvis
showed marked destruction of osseous fragment involving part of

ligament collection. Seen by N-[**Doctor First Name **], recommended extensive [**Doctor First Name **],

Gen: alert and oriented male, pleasant, appears in no apparent
distress.
HEENT: pupils equal round and reactive to light, extraocular
movements intact, orophyarnx clear, moist mucous membranes. no
jugular venous distention.
Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally, no

sounds. no palpable hepatosplenomegaly.
Ext: no clubbing cyanosis or edema, 2+ distal pulses.
Skin: patients entire gluteal region is erythematous. on right
side, there is an approx 3 cm decub ulcer that extends down to
his pelvic bone. no frank pus around wound, but  but when
dressing was removed it did have a greenish fluid on it.


Pertinent Results:
MRI Lumbar Spine [**2161-8-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Osteomyelitis of L5 and S1 level with large
interosseous abscess extending into the presacral region
anteriorly and posteriorly to the interspinous regions and soft
tissue. Enhancing inflammatory soft tissues are seen within the
spinal canal in the lumbar region. Findings were discussed with
the resident covering the patient at the time of interpretation
of this study on [**2161-8-2**] at 3:30 P.M.

[**2161-8-2**] MRI Right hip:
IMPRESSION: 1. Suboptimal study. Repeat study including pre and
post contrast images with non-breath hold technique is
recommended.
2. Extensive osseous destruction involving the bilateral sacral
ala and lower lumbar spine, with adjacent fluid collection
extending into the buttocks. Findings are consistent with
osteomyelitis.
3. Large ulceration of the superficial tissue underlying the
right ischial tuberosity, involving the hamstring insertion.
4. 5 cm long fistulous tract extending from the midline above
the buttocks to the rectum.

[**2161-8-6**] CT abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive inflammatory mass centered about the L5/S1
interspace with associated frank bony destruction. These
findings are compatible with the patient's known history of
chronic osteomyelitis. At this time, no drainable fluid
collection is identified.
2. Ulceration of the superficial soft tissues underlying the
right ischial tuberosity as above with associated inflammatory
changes and soft tissue thickening surrounding the right hip
joint but no abscess formation. This process appears separate
from the spinal process.

Cultures:
[**7-31**]: Enterobacter and pseudomonas
[**7-30**]: blood cultures negative to date
[**7-30**]: urine eterobacter cloacae time 2


Brief Hospital Course:
He was transferred from [**Hospital3 934**] hospital on [**7-30**].
He was on IV meropenem ([**7-31**]) and vancomycin ([**8-3**]) for his MRSA
infection.  He was hydrated and given antibiotics and was
admitted for depbridement of his paraspinal, psoas, aravertebral
and presacral abscesses.  He had a debridement of the ulcer with
diverting transverse loop colostomy on [**2161-8-7**].  He was
placed in the intensive care unit on a ventilator.  His
antibiotics were continued.  he   He had twice daily dresing
changes from wet to dry.  Plastic surgery and Neurosurgery
evaluated him daily and assisted in the dressing changes.  He
was also followed by [**Last Name (un) **] while in the hospital, to help
maintain tight control of his blood sugars.  He was extubated by
[**8-9**], and was transferred out to the floor on [**8-10**].  he
began a diet and tolerated regular food.  The patient did
remarkably well after his surgery, was tolerating a regular
diet, his vital signs and lab values were normal and his white
blood cell count trended back to normal.  He was stable to go to
rehab by [**8-13**], and needed rehab for help with dressing
changes.  The infectious disease service suggested 3 weeks of
vancomycin for a total course of 6 weeks, and to stop the
merepenem on discharge.  Plastic surgery decided that wet to dry
dressings were appropriate, and that a vac dressing would not be
placed at this time.  He has plans to follow up with ID and with
plastic surgery for further management of his wounds.  he was
discharged in stable condition to the rehab facility
