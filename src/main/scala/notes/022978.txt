Bright Red Blood Per Rectum

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 yo man with a new diagnosis of liver
cirrhosis c/b esophageal and gastric varices who is transferred
from [**Hospital1 1562**] for further evaluation of variceal bleed.  The
patient was golfing on [**2107-2-18**] when he developed the urge to go
to the bathroom.  He had a large bloody bowel movement followed
by hematemesis (bright red with dark clots).  He presented to
the [**Hospital1 1562**] ED and was admitted to the ICU.  EGD showed mostly
gastric varices but also esophageal varices, the former of which
were thought to be the source of bleeding.  The patient was
intubated for the procedure and extubated about 2 days later.
He was transfused 2 units pRBC total, and Hct remained stable on
octreotide and PPI gtt.  These were discontinued after several
days (PPI switched to [**Hospital1 **] boluses), RIJ removed, and pt
transferred to the floor.  He was to be discharged in the next
day or two.  However, this AM, he had a new episode of BRPBR
without hematemesis totalling about 200-300c.  He had relative
hypotension with BPs decreased from 130 to 110 although his HR
remained in the 60s-70s (on nadolol, started sometime during his
inpatient course).  His Hct trended down from 31 at 4am -> 27 at
10am.  It appears he was started on flagyl IV. The patient was
transferred back to ICU, and an EGD was done which revealed
grade 3 lower and mid esophageal varices with no sign of active
bleeding. There was a large clot with small amount of fresh
blood in the stomach and varcies in the cardia and likley fundus
somewhat obscured by the clots.  No intervention was done.  The
plan was made to transfer pt to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of TIPS
or sclerotherapy.  His last Hct prior to transfer was 23; pt was
given 1 unit of pRBC with improvement in SBPs to 120s with a 2nd
unit hanging en route.  During his OSH hospitalization, the
patient was also treated for possible LE cellulitis with
vancomycin and ceftriaxone (course unclear).
.
On the floor, pt is without complaints.  He did have 100cc
maroon liquid stool on arrival and subsequently had a small
amount of black tarry stool.  No N/V, abdominal pain.  He denies
any ASA or NSAID use.  He admits to a few alcoholic drinks
several times weekly.  His brother was a heavy drinker and died
of cirrhosis; he denies any other family history of liver
disorder.

Pertinent Results:
Abdominal U/S ([**2107-3-1**])
FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates a heterogeneous nodular
appearance, but no focal liver lesion is identified. There is no
biliary dilatation seen. A small amount of sludge and a layer of
small shadowing gallstones are seen within the lumen of the
gallbladder. There is no gallbladder wall edema or
pericholecystic fluid identified. The pancreas is unremarkable,
but is only partially visualized due to overlying bowel. The
spleen is enlarged measuring 14.4 cm. The right kidney measures
9.3 cm and the left kidney measures 11.2 cm. There is mild
fullness of the right kidney, of undetermined etiology. No AAA
is identified. A small amount of ascites is seen in the
perihepatic space.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images
were
obtained. The main portal vein, right portal vein and left
portal vein are
patent with hepatopetal flow. Appropriate arterial waveforms are
seen in the main, right and left hepatic arteries. Appropriate
venous flow is seen in the IVC and the hepatic veins.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent hepatic vasculature.
2. Nodular hepatic architecture with no focal liver lesion
identified.
3. Small amount of sludge and gallstones. No signs of
cholecystitis.
4. Mild right renal fullness of undetermined etiology.
5. Splenomegaly.
6. Trace of ascites in the perihepatic space.

[**3-1**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Mild volume overload, cannot exclude bibasilar

.
TIPS [**3-2**]:
1. Successful TIPS from the right hepatic vein into the right
portal vein
with placement of a 10 mm x 9 cm, 7cm covered/2 cm
(covered/uncovered stent).
2. Portosystemic gradient initially was 7 mmHg and was reduced
to 4 mmHg
after creating the shunt.
3. Partial embolization of one of four gastroesophageal varices
with 5 cc of absolute alcohol. Additional embolization was
deferred at this point due to limiting patient's exposure to
contrast media as well as radiation dose.
.
[**3-4**] liver u/s for TIPS:
CONCLUSION: Patent TIPS shunts with velocities ranging from
85-190 cm/sec.
