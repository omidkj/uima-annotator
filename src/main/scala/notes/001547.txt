Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
worst headache of life with right sided numbness and weakness.
nausea, vomiting, slurred speech

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Frontal EVD
Diagnostic cerebral angiogram
Tracheostomy
PEG placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old male who at 9pm this evening was
ambulating to the bathroom when he "reeled" to the right side
and
then leaned to his right side.  At the same moment he
experienced
right lateral neck pain and headache associated with numbness on
the right side of his body, slurred speech, and nausea and
vomiting.  The pt denies any visual disturbance, bowel and
bladder incontinence, or hearing deficit at the time of the
event.  The patient was brought to an outside hospital where he
had a Head Ct which was consistent with a posterior fossa
hemorrhage with hemorrhage in the ventricles as well.  The
patient was transferred here for further management. The patient
denies taking aspirin, Coumadin, Plavix heparin or Lovenox

Past Medical History:
HTN, asthma, low back surgery, enlarged prostate


Social History:
lives at home with his wife.  The patient has three
daughters who are at the bedside and one son who is flying in to
see the patient overnight.

with
exam with much prompting.

Recall:grossly intact
Language: Speech slow with good comprehension and repetition.
Naming intact.

Cranial Nerves:
I: Not tested

confrontation.
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally with
nystagmus.

IX, X: Palatal elevation symmetrical.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius normal bilaterally.
XII: Tongue midline without fasciculations.

Motor: Normal bulk and tone bilaterally. No abnormal movements,
tremors. Strength on right 4- biceps/triceps/delts.left foot
drop
is reported as patients baseline.  dorsiflexors/plantar flexors
[**1-21**].

Sensation: Intact to light touch.

Toes downgoing bilaterally

Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating
movements.

ON DISCHARGE
Exam fluctuates ; at best he will eye open to voice with tactile
stim.  No tracking, + simple commands (sticks out tongue /
wiggle toes), Nods yest to name only (appropirate to challenge
of name), + right facial weakness, pupils 1.5mm to pinpoint/
reactive, attempts to localize to sternal rub/ + grimace, triple
flexion on lower ext.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head with and without contrast [**2168-1-31**]
1.Intracranial hemorrhage, centered in the superior vermis of
the
cerebellum, with extension to involve the subarachnoid and
intraventricular spaces. The extent of hemorrhage has increased
over the short-interval since the prior examination, with an
increase in the size of the ventricles, which is likely related
to the hemorrhage within the ventricular system resulting in
outflow obstruction.
Consideration may be given to external ventricular drainage.

2.Multiple small arterial feeding vessels extending towards the
cerebellar
vermian hemorrhage, with single prominent collecting vein,
draining directly into the vein of [**Male First Name (un) 2096**], concerning for a
vascular malformation. Given that there is no principal arterial
feeder or typical vascular nidus identified, and that there is a
close relationship of these multiple arteries to the tentorial
dura, these findings suggest an underlying dural arteriovenous
fistula, rather than a true arteriovenous malformation (which
would, in any case, be unusual in a patient of this age).

CT Head without contrast [**2168-2-2**]
1)New or increased bitemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage,
concerning for new or
continued bleeding from the cerebellar hemorrhagic focus.
2) Otherwise, stable appearance of cerebellar vermian hemorrhage
with unchanged vasogenic edema causing mild supratentorial
herniation. No midline shift. No increased mass effect.
3) Interval placement of a right frontal approach
ventriculostomy catheter terminating into the third ventricle.
No significant change in the degree of ventricular dilatation.
Stable appearance of blood products within third, fourth and
lateral ventricles, with some redistribution.

Radiology Report CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study
Date of [**2168-2-3**] 12:36 AM

Final Report
HISTORY: 78-year-old man, with altered mental status, and large
cerebellar
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with intraventricular extension to
the lateral, third and fourth ventricles. Now status post stent
placement. De-saturating in the 70% FIO2 and febrile. Assess for
pulmonary source.

COMPARISON: Limited comparison from prior chest radiographs with
the latest on [**2168-2-2**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to
the lung
bases before and after administration of IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained for evaluation.

CTA CHEST: The study is moderately limited by suboptimal IV
bolus timing as the segmental and subsegmental branches of the
pulmonary arterial vasculature are insufficiently opacified.
There is no central pulmonary embolism. The study is further
limited by patient's inadvertent expiration during the
supposedly end-inspiratory phase, evident by posterior tracheal
wall bowing (2:16). The tracheobronchial tree remains patent.

Respiratory motions limits evaluation of the lower lobes, but no
suspicious lung masses or nodules are detected. There is
bibasilar dependent atelectasis. Bilateral simple pleural
effusions are small on the right and trace on the left. There is
no pneumothorax. There are scattered calcified lymph nodes, with
representative ones seen in the subcarinal station (2:26) and
the right hilum (2:27). None of the central lymph nodes are not
pathologically enlarged, ranging up to 6 mm in the right lower
paratracheal station (3:52). There is no hilar or axillary
lymphadenopathy.

The visualized thyroid is normal. Heart size is top normal, with
trace
physiologic pericardial effusion. The left main coronary artery
and the left anterior descending artery are partially calcified.
Calcified atherosclerotic plaques scatter along the aortic arch.
The aorta is otherwise normal in caliber and course, without
acute aortic pathology. The remaining great mediastinal vessels
are normal.

The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis. A 24 x
21 mm
hypodense left hepatic lesion (2:24) is compatible with a liver
cyst. The
right kidney is not imaged, but in the expected location of the
right upper pole, there is a hypodense lesion, likely represents
a exophytic renal cyst (2:56). The visualized spleen, adrenal
glands and pancreas are grossly unremarkable. There is a small
hiatal hernia.

BONE WINDOW: No suspicious osteolytic or blastic lesion is
noted. There are mild-to-moderate multilevel degenerative
changes.

IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal IV bolus timing limits assessment of subsegmental
and segmental pulmonary artery vasculature. No central pulmonary
embolism. No acute aortic pathology.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions, right larger than left.
3. Partially calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. No
lymphadenopathy.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
