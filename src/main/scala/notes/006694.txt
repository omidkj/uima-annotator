Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2090**]
Chief Complaint:
Inability to ambulate, diplopia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Lumbar puncture
2. Duodenal biopsy
3. Sural nerve and muscle biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 21 year old male with mental retardation with
history of viral encephalitis/ADEM who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
fever, altered MS and inability to walk. The patient has been
having low grade temperatures at the house. At baseline, he was
what sounds like cerebral palsy, mild ataxia (he is wheelchair
dependent), and slurred speech. He was becoming more drowsy and
started having worsened slurred speech and inability to
ambulate. He was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2199-1-4**] with respiratory
symptoms of difficulty breathing/cough in addition slurred
speech and ataxia. It was thought at time that primary
respiratory disease may have been contributing to exacerbation
of prior deficits from infectious/inflammatory CNS disease
(Hospitalization [**Hospital1 18**] [**Month (only) 205**]-[**2198-8-14**]). He was discharged from ED
and his residential home did not think he ever improved.
.
[**Known firstname 65219**] has been hospitalized for neurological deficits in the
past. In the years [**2191**] and [**2192**], he had neurological symptoms
that were alternatively labeled meningitis, encephalitis, and
ADEM. He recovered from this episode with only mild clumsy
walking. He was again seen in [**2198-3-14**] for left facial droop
but otherwise nonfocal exam. MRI at that time showed "a focus of
increased T2 and FLAIR signal in right cerebral peduncle".
.
Patient again developed neurologic issues in [**2198-7-14**] with
progressive gait instability and speech became more garbled. He
was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (3) 65220**]. On [**2198-8-5**] MRI with
gadolinium showed progression of the T2 signal abnormality and
contrast enhancement within the pontomesencephalic portion of
brainstem. This was thought to be atypical of demylinating
lesions. Lumbar puncture showed 13 WBC with atypical lymphocytes
in CSF. Over the first 24 hours of that admission patient had
problems with secretions and then he had more ataxia, unability
to speak, and facial weakness. CSF analysis for infectious
etiology negative (cryptococcal antigen neg, HSV neg, EBV neg,
protein electrophoresis showed no oligoclonal banding, viral cx,
fungal cx, AFB neg, VZV neg, serum mycoplasma and HIV neg.
Patient was treated with 5 days of steroids and improved speech,
drooling and gait. During that hospitilization he developed
aspiration pneumonia. He later worsened neurologically, becoming
anarthric, drooling. Repeat MRI showed progression of brainstem
enhancing lesion extending from pons, spreading to the inferior
cerbellar peduncle and extending to the left thalamic lesion. He
again was treated with 5 days of IV steroids and transitioned to
5 week course of oral steroids. CTA head negative for
vasculitis. He continued to have problems swallowing and went
home on a dysphagia diet.
.
He was discharged to a rehab hospital on a steroid taper and
eventually recovered to his baseline.
