History of Present Illness:
82-year-old man from [**Country 4812**] w/ asthma, HTN, CRI was
transferred from OSH 2 days ago w/ PNA and acute renal failure.
He initially presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-3**] w/ 2 days of fever,
productive cough, and increasing dyspnea w/ wheezing.  His PCP
referred him to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED at that time.  At [**Location (un) 620**], he was
afebrile w/ Tm 98.8 and O2 sat 96% RA.  CXR demonstrated R hilar
consolidation, prompting treatment w/ levaquin, prednisone 60mg,
and albuterol/atrovent.  He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
for ongoing eval of acute renal failure.
.
At the [**Hospital1 18**], dx of PNA was confirmed w/ CXR w/ elevated WBC and
10% bandemia.  Baseline ABG was 7.4/27/102/17.  He was treated
w/ levaquin, and workup of his renal failure was begun w/ UA,
urine sediment exam, etc.  This AM, he was found to be agitated
on rounds, refusing to take medications and disoriented per his
family.  This prompted ABG, which was 7.07/63/63.  MICU team was
called for eval.  The pt was intubated for resp support and
treated w/ lasix 20mg IV.  He is now transferred to the MICU for
ongoing care.

.
UA ([**2141-3-4**]): 3+ protein, large bld, no dysmorphic RBC
.
BCX ([**2141-3-5**]):  pending
.
Radiology:
=========
CXR ([**2141-3-5**]):  increased R hilar consolidation, no pulm edema
.
Renal U/S ([**2141-3-7**]):
.
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 8.6 cm. The left kidney
measures 8.8 cm. Multiple 1-cm cysts present in the right
kidney, and one 1.5-cm cyst is present within the left kidney.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for hydronephrosis.
.
Chest CT [**2141-3-7**]:
.
Multifocal pulmonary consolidation--in the apex of right upper
lobe, anterior segment of the left upper lobe, right middle lobe
extending to the hilus, apicoposterior segment of the left upper
lobe, and right lower lobe--has rapidly progressed since [**3-3**] and 19
.
1) Multifocal pneumonia continues to worsen. No airway
obstruction except for bronchomalacia, involving at least the
bronchus intermedius. Full assessment would require expiratory
imaging without positive pressure ventilation.
.
2) Likely anemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
82-yo-man w/ asthma, HTN, CRI, glucose intolerance, transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-3**] w/ RML PNA and acute renal failure. He was
transferred to MICU for mgmt of respiratory failure on [**2141-3-6**].
His pulmonary status was optimized on ventilatory support and he
was successfully extubated on [**3-10**].
.
1. Respiratory failure:  He was emergently intubated for
hypercarbic resp failure, most likely from respiratory muscle
fatigue secondary to compensation for metabolic acidosis in the
setting of acute renal failure and sepsis. He was found to have
a MRSA pneumonia and was treated with a course of vancomycin. He
was also empirically treated for CAP with levofloxacin. He was
extubated on [**2141-3-10**] and transferred to the
.
2. PNA/sepsis: Initially had elevated WBC w/ bandemia on
admission, resp distress, and evolving R hilar consolidation on
CXR despite levaquin treatment.  This raised concern for PNA
that was resistant to levaquin therapy.  Therefore started on
broad abx with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo. In addition, elevated lactate
was concerning for hyoperfusion in the setting of sepsis,
although this may be confounded by acidosis in the setting of
renal failure. Improved respiratory status on antibiotics, with
improved productive secretions. Blood cultures remained sterile
and sputum cultures were unrevealing. Legionella antigen
negative. Given continued improvement, zosyn was discontinued on
[**3-7**]. Follow-up chest CT demonstrated no obstructive lesion-
non-obstructive mass vs infiltrate. He completed 14 day course
of vanco/levo. F/U CT scan will need to be done as outpatient to
evaluate resolution of opacity.
.
3. Asthma: Felt to contribute to respiratory distress, and
exacerbated by PNA.
Treated with solumedrol initially and weaned successfully to
prednisone taper. B-blocker discontinued given exacerbation of
his reactive airway disease. He remained respiratory stable with
standing albuterol and atrovent inhalers
.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Prior renal U/S on [**1-23**]
showed small kidneys with cystic disease consistent with chronic
renal failure. Recent baseline creat has been high 2s; creat 3.9
at [**Location (un) 620**] ED and 3.7 here on admission. BUN also higher than
baseline, but maintained good urine output throughout. Prerenal
state felt unlikely with FeNA 3%. +Blood on UA at [**Location (un) 620**] but no
flank pain to suggest stone. Had large blood and 3+ protein by
dipstick. No dysmorphic RBC/casts seen on microscopy so less
likely glomerulonephritis, but could be FSBS. Spot urine
protein/Cr shows sig proteinuria 4.5. Likely FSGS [**1-19**] HTN. Renal
