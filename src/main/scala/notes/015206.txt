HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old female
with a history of mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic
heart disease who has developed worsening dyspnea on exertion
over the last several months.  In addition she has complained
of orthopnea and bilateral lower extremity edema.  The
patient also has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
which causes her to have decompensated heart failure.  The
patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for mitral valve
replacement.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 3874**] on [**2-23**], for preoperative diuresis prior to her
mitral valve replacement.  On [**3-2**], she was transferred
to [**Hospital6 256**] preoperatively for
mitral valve replacement.  Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 33180**] showed a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 20, pulmonary artery pressure [**6-25**], cardiac index
1.94, mitral valve area of 0.87 cm square and normal left
ventricular systolic function.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Rheumatic heart disease.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Sarcoidosis which is currently inactive.
4.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Zocor 20 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Sotalol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Flovent 110 two puffs p.o. b.i.d.
7.  NPH insulin 20 units subcutaneously q. AM and 14 units
subcutaneously q. PM.
8.  Synthroid 50 mcg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Sulfa and is
intolerant of Amiodarone which caused pulmonary toxicity.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2195-3-2**] and
admitted to the Cardiology Service for continued preoperative
diuresis.  The patient was transferred on a Natrecor
infusion.  The patient underwent a carotid ultrasound on
[**3-4**] which showed no significant hemodynamic lesion in
either right or left carotid arteries, and the patient was
taken to the Operating Room on [**3-4**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
for a mitral valve replacement and a maze procedure.  Mitral
valve was a 29 mm Mosaic pericardial valve, total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 111 minutes, crossclamp time
was 81 minutes.  Please see operative note for further
details.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition on Milrinone and Neo-Synephrine
infusion.  The patient remained intubated on her first
postoperative night due to her being slow to awaken
postoperatively.  The patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation on postoperative day #1.  She was
started on Lasix with good response.

On the early morning of postoperative day #2, the patient was
found to be oliguric.  She was given an extra dose of Lasix
with minimal results.  She was also found to be tachypneic.
Blood gas at that time showed significant respiratory
acidosis.  The patient received aggressive pulmonary toilet,
however, her oxygenation continued to decline and she was
eventually reintubated for respiratory distress without
difficulty.  Due to the oliguria and the requirement for
reintubation as well as significant hypotension with the
intubation, a transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained
which showed no pericardial effusion, normal ejection
fraction.  A pulmonary artery catheter was reinserted, and
showed elevated filling pressures and marginal cardiac index
during this time.  The patient has gone into atrial
fibrillation which was thought to be part of the cause of the
decreased cardiac output.  Therefore the patient was sedated
and cardioversion was attempted with brief success, about 2
to 3 minutes of sinus rhythm and the patient converted back
into atrial fibrillation.  The patient continued on
Milrinone.  The patient was started on Natrecor to aid with
pulmonary hypertension and diuresis.  The patient was started
on Digoxin to aid with rate control.  On postoperative day
#3, electrophysiology consult was obtained and recommended
rate control and restarting Sotalol once the patient became
hemodynamically more stable.  Also on postoperative day #2,
the patient underwent bronchoscopy for increased secretions
which showed no secretions and mild airway edema.  The
patient continued to receive Lasix for continued diuresis and
on postoperative day #3, the patient was weaned and extubated
from mechanical ventilation.  The patient continued in atrial
fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular
contractions.  The patient had then been started on a heparin
infusion for anticoagulation on the atrial fibrillation.  The
Heart Failure Service recommended weaning the Milrinone and
increasing the Natrecor given the increased ventricular
ectopy.  The Electrophysiology Service agreed.  They
recommended starting low dose beta blocker and increasing as
tolerated, and continuing the anticoagulation.

The patient remained extubated, requiring a fair amount of
pulmonary toilet.  By postoperative day #6, the patient
continued to have pulmonary hypertension and remained in
atrial fibrillation and continued to have atrial
fibrillation.  It was decided by the team on postoperative
day #7 to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule
out clot and attempt cardioversion.  Echocardiogram was
performed which had incompletely assessed left ventricular
systolic function as the echo probe was only passed to 35 cm
due to the patient's history of distal esophageal strictures.
There was no evidence of thrombus in the left or right
atrium.  No mitral regurgitation and 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation was noted.  Cardioversion was attempted times
two and was unsuccessful and the patient was restarted on the
Sotalol and the Digoxin was discontinued.  Several hours
after the Sotalol was administered, the patient converted
into sinus rhythm with first degree atrioventricular block.
Also on postoperative day #6, the patient had been noted to
have an elevated white blood cell count and had been
pancultured.  The white blood cell count rose to as high as
13.7.  Three out of four blood cultures drawn on
postoperative day #6 were positive for coagulase negative
Staphylococcus.  The patient had a PICC line which had been
placed at the outside hospital which was removed.  The
patient's central line was removed.  The patient's [**Known lastname 8389**]
catheter was removed and the patient had peripheral
intravenous lines placed.  The patient was started on
Vancomycin.  The patient continued on Natrecor intermittently
requiring Neo-Synephrine, low dose to maintain blood
pressure.

Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommended
continuing the Vancomycin.  On the evening of postoperative
day #8, the patient began complaining of pain in her right
great toe which she felt was similar to the two attacks of
gout that she has had in the past.  She was given two doses
of Colchicine and the pain improved.  The patient's Natrecor
was weaned to off over the next couple of days.  The patient
continued on the Sotalol and Lopressor, however, the
patient's heart rate began to decrease into the low 60s, high
50s.  The session was had with the Electrophysiology Team and
the Lopressor was discontinued.  Subsequent blood cultures
after postoperative day #6 were negative.  The Infectious
Disease Team recommended a two week course of Vancomycin to
be started counting on [**3-12**].  The patient continued to be
in sinus rhythm with first degree atrioventricular block on
postoperative day #9.  The patient complained of continued
pain in her foot.  The patient was started on Ibuprofen.
Over the next two days, the patient's creatinine increased to
a high of 1.7.  On postoperative day #12, the Ibuprofen was
discontinued and the creatinine began to decrease.  On
postoperative day #12, the patient had a new PICC line placed
by Interventional Radiology for her Vancomycin.  She has a
4-French PICC catheter, 48 cm long placed in her left basilic
vein with the tip in the left subclavian
