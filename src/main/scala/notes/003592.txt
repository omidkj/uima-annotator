FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, he is an elderly
white male intubated.  His temperature was 99.8, heart rate
75, blood pressure 136/60.  O2 saturation was 88% on 100%
FIO2, 15 of PEEP, and 16 of IMV.  Neck was supple, full range
of motion, and no lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly.  Carotids are
2+ and equal bilaterally without bruits.  Lungs had coarse
breath sounds diffusely up to the mid chest.  Cardiovascular
examination:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft and nontender
with positive bowel sounds, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities had 1+ bilateral pitting edema.  Neurologic
examination:  He was sedated.

He was admitted to the CCU and he was diuresed.  Renal was
consulted.  They recommended holding his ACE inhibitor.  He
ruled in for a MI with a peak troponin of 3.24, peak CPK of
934 with 37% MB.  He was diuresed with Lasix drip and he was
started on CVVH as a therapy prior to cardiac
catheterization.

On [**10-31**], he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed
a 70% distal left main stenosis, 80% ostial proximal left
anterior descending artery stenosis, 70% long proximal left
circumflex stenosis, and a 90% OM-3 stenosis.  RCA had a
proximal occlusion.

Dr[**Last Name (Prefixes) 4558**] was consulted, and the patient was continued
on CVVH.  The patient continued to improve, was extubated.
His creatinine was up to 3.3 and came back down to 2.4 with
CVVH.  He was transferred to the floor on [**11-2**],
hospital day four, and continued to progress and on [**11-5**], he
underwent a CABG x3 with PDA endarterectomy.  He had a
saphenous vein graft to the PDA to the distal LAD and a LIMA
to the diagonal with a cross clamp time was 99 minutes.
Total bypass time was 117 minutes.  He was transferred to the
CSRU in stable condition, and was only on propofol.

He was extubated postoperative night and his creatinine was
2.8 on postoperative day #1.  He had good urine output.  He
was A-paced for blood pressure support.  His creatinine on
postoperative day two went up to 3.6, and we continued to
monitor this.

On postoperative day three, it came down to 3.6, and he was
transferred to the floor in stable condition.  He was started
on Plavix immediately postoperatively for his endarterectomy
and chest tubes D/C'd on postoperative day #2.  He continued
to progress.  Had his epicardial pacing wires D/C'd on
postoperative day #4, and Renal continued to follow him.  His
creatinine remained around 3, and on postoperative day #6, he
was discharged to home in stable condition.
