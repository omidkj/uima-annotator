Brief Hospital Course:
83M with multiple comorbidities presents with FDG negative RML
nodule.  Pt underwent VATS to establish tissue diagnosis.
Preliminary report of frozen sections showed likely hamartoma.
Mass was then completely enucleated.  Post-op CXR showed small
right apical pneumothorax.
Shortly after, his course was complicated by respiratory failure
and patient was re-intubated.  CXR showed R enlarged basilar
pneumothorax with the right chest tube external to the pleural
space.  The chest tube was repositioned and POD1 CXR showed
resolution of the R basilar ptx and pt was subsequently
extubated.
On POD2, pt had bradycardic respiratory arrest on the floor.
Code called, ACLS initiated with chest compression, epi and
atropine x2.  ABG revealed hypercapnea with a pCO2 of 130 and pH
of 7.00.  Pt was reintubated, narrow complex returned with
return of BP, and ppt was transferred to the TSICU.  CXR showed
no evidence of ptx.  Head CT showed no evidence of acute
intracranial process.  Neurology was consulted and recommended
head MRI to assess for evidence of hypoxic/ischemic injury.
This was negative.
Pt also underwent central line change with new stick.  Post-line
CXR showed new large right PTX.  A new right 24F chest tube was
placed, and the previous [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] pleural drain was removed.
Post tube CXR showed persistent large R PTX extending to the
apex.  Chest tube was continued to suction and patient was
stable respiratory-wise.
Pt was also febrile and started empirically on vanc and zosyn.
Mental status returned to [**Location 213**] and pt was following commands.
Over the next few days, pt was stable on tube feeds and
antibiotics.  Pt did not tolerate vent wean (RSBI 177).  He
received 2 units of pRBC and lasix for Hct of 22.8.  Over this
time he developed marked muscle weakness.  Per neuro, pt was
exhibiting signs of myopthay vs degenerative muscle dz.  EMG by
neurology showed electrophysiologic evidence for a severe,
generalized sensorimotor polyneuropathy and as well as an a
superimposed myopathy.  neuromuscular junction disorders cannot
be entirely excluded.  They also recommended LP with was
negative.  BAL cx grew yeast and pt was started on fluconazole.
He continued to fail vent wean and a trach and PEG were
discussed and planned with family.  Serial CXR showed persistent
PTX, but stable.
Physical Therapy- consult for evaluation [**2136-3-11**].
Trach and PEG were placed [**2136-3-12**].  Zosyn was dc'ed for negative
cx.  post-operatively pt was doing well and R PTX was resolving.
 It was noted that his sodium was also slowly increasing.  free
water boluses were initiated and tube feeds changed from
respolar.  Pt continued to not tolerate CPAP trials.  It was
decided that pt to go to vent rehab.  on [**3-14**] chest tube was
removed and post-pull CXR showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
[**3-16**]- lasix gtt started for diuresis and assist w/ ventilatory
wean. Pt diuresed effectively to to weight of 68kg
[**2136-3-18**].(pre-op wt=147lbs)
[**3-19**]- lasix gtt d/c, changed to Lasix 30 mg po qd per cardiology
recs. CPAP PS wean cont @ .50/23ps/5 peep/ rr19/100%sat in [**1-20**]
hour episodes as tolerated. REsting mode=AC/.50/600/12/5 peep.
500cc negative  as was goal. CP in afternoon, no EKG changes,
CPK/MB labs - negative. BP low overnight, diuresis d/c x24 and
to resume QD.
Physical Therapy/ Occupational Therapy re-eval patient.
[**2136-3-20**]- Pt stable VS throughout the night, CPAP 20/5 x3 hours x1
returned to resting mode for fatigue- ^RR; After recovery on
resting mode- ABG=7.40/41/136/26/0. PT following pt.
Tubefeeding at goal. OOB to chair w/ assist 3hours x2.
[**2136-3-21**]- Pt stable overnight, no events. Comfortable.
Pt transfer to [**Hospital **] REhab s/ stable vital signs.
