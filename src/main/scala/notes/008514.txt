History of Present Illness:
65yo male with known CAD (3vd with severe LV dysfunction Cath
[**2119-5-2**] with Taxus stent to LAD and LCx) , CHF (EF >30%) and PVD
who presents with intermittent SSCP [**5-22**] with radiation to back
and associated with SOB since 1pm on day of admission that is
partially relieved by SL nitro.  Pt took the first SL nitro with
improvements but sx returned within 30 mi., 2nd SL nitro taken
at 5PM and 3rd SL nitro taken at 7PM.  When pain did not resolve
with 3rd SL nitro patient called EMS.  Pt reports he has not
taken his medications at ome for at least 2 days prior to
admission (including plavis and aspirin).  Pt denies n/v, leg
swelling, orthopnea, PND.
  In [**Name (NI) **] pt received SL nitro x3, lopressor 5mg IV x5, morphine
2mg IV, ASA and was eventually placed on nitro and heparin gtt.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2119-3-23**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include inferolateral hypokinesis and
distal anteroseptal and apical akinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2118-12-2**], left ventricular systolic function is now
significantly impaired (in retrospect may have had mild
hypokinesis on prior study).

[**2119-9-22**] Cardiac catheterization:
"FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild mitral regurgitation.
3. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction with LVEF 29%.
4. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
5. Low cardiac index of 1.8 L/min/m2 by Fick.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated
severe three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent, flow-limiting stenoses. The LAD had
severe
serial lesions up to 90% in the proximal and midvessel. The LCx
had
severe in-stent restenosis and a totally occluded OM2 branch.
The RCA
had diffuse calcification and an 80% midvessel stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed pulmonary hypertension with a
PA
systolic pressure of 60 mmHg. Mean PCWP was elevated at 30 mmHg.
Central
hypertension was noted with blood pressure 158/80 mmHg. Left
sided
filling pressures were elevated with LVEDP 31 mmHg. No
significant
gradient was noted on catheter pullback from LV to central
aorta.
Cardiac index was low at 1.8 L/min/m2 by Fick.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation,
global
hypokinesis, and LVEF 29%."

"STUDY: Bilateral carotid series complete.

REASON: Preop for CABG.

STUDY II: Venous duplex.

REASON: Patient in need of CABG, evaluate for conduit.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed on both carotid
arteries. Minimal
plaque was identified.

On the right peak systolic velocities are 82, 69, 99 in the ICA,
CCA, ECA
respectively. The ICA:CCA ratio was 0.7. This is consistent with
a less-

On the left peak systolic velocities are 82, 62, 178 in the ICA,
CCA, ECA
respectively. The ICA:CCA ratio is 1.3. This is consistent with
a less-
than-40% stenosis.

There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less-than-40% carotid

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 65yo male with known 3v CAD s/p PTCA with stent in LAD and
LCx in 4'[**19**], PVD, and DM who presents with CP in setting of
medical non-compliance.
.
1.  CAD:  The patient had undergone a cardiac catheterization
which revealed diffuse 3v CAD.  At this time the cardiothoracic
surgery team wa consulted for a possible CABG procddure.  While
awaiting CABG, the patient was medically optimized on ASA 325mg
once daily, Plavix 75mg once daily, Metoprolol, ACE, statin,
heparin gtt, and  nitro gtt.  The pre-op work up for CABG was
undertaken including an UA, CXR, bilateral carotid US and
bilateral LE vein mapping.  At this point, the cardiothoracic
surgery team had taken over management of the patient.
.
2.  DM:  The patient was maintained on his outpatient regim
