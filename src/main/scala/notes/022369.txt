CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Coronary artery disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old man
with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart
failure, with ejection fraction of 25%, hypertension, and
hypercholesterolemia, who presented to an outside hospital on
[**2179-3-25**], after sudden onset of shortness of breath and
chest pressure while walking.  His cardiac enzymes were
slightly elevated while in the hospital and he was also
diagnosed with congestive heart failure.  An echocardiogram
revealed an ejection fraction of 20% with global hypokinesis.
He was transferred then to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:  Status post inferior myocardial
infarction ten years ago.
2.  Congestive heart failure, with ejection fraction of 25%.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Status post tonsillectomy 50 years ago.

ALLERGIES:   None known.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Bumex 2 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Celexa 20 mg q. day.
3.  Zestril 10 mg q. day.
4.  Atenolol 50 mg twice a day.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg q. day.
6.  Vitamin E.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg q. day.
8.  Nitroglycerin patch 0.2 mg q. a.m.; off q. p.m.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Medicine Service and underwent a catheterization which
revealed severe left main and three-vessel coronary artery
disease with a severely depressed ejection fraction of 24%.

On [**2179-3-30**], he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
times three, with left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal,
saphenous vein graft to PDA.  He was transferred to the
Cardiac Care Unit postoperatively.  He had an intra-aortic
balloon pump at the time and was on pressors.  The
vasopressors were slowly weaned off over the next couple of
days.  He was extubated on postoperative day one.

On postoperative day two, his intra-aortic balloon pump was
weaned and discontinued.  On postoperative day three, he was
noted to have an expiratory wheeze while lying down which
would disappear when he sat up.  He was treated with
Albuterol MDI.  He continued to have episodic shortness of
breath with wheezing and tachycardia, which mainly would
resolve with Albuterol nebulizers.  A chest x-ray was done
which showed bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  The patient
had chest physiotherapy at this point.

On [**2179-4-2**], a Pulmonary consultation was obtained for the
episodes of shortness of breath and wheezing.  The Pulmonary
consult suspected and upper airway pathology which could
become audible during the rapid breathing phase of
[**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] respiration.  They recommended an ENT
evaluation, steroids, plus/minus racemic epinephrine.

An ENT consultation was obtained was obtained at that time
and a fiberoptic examination showed a normal nasopharynx,
hypopharynx and larynx with no granulation tissue or edema,
normal vocal cord appearance and mobility.  The impression
was that he had normal vocal cords and a wide open glottis
and they suggested evaluating for dynamic upper airway
obstruction below the level of the vocal cords.  Over the
next few days, he continued to have episodes of audible
expiratory wheeze.  He was also slightly confused at this
point.

On [**2179-4-4**], he underwent a bronchoscopy which showed a
normal oropharynx, normal larynx, no endobronchial lesions,
mild dynamic clots at the level of the main stem.  He
continued to be treated with Metered-Dose Inhalers and
racemic epinephrine.

A Cardiology consultation was also obtained and they
recommended to continue diuresis and give bronchodilators.
On [**4-7**], the patient had an episode of rigors accompanied
by hypertension, tachycardia and mottled lower extremities
and expiratory wheezes bilaterally.  The patient was treated
with two doses of Benadryl intravenously.  The episode
resolved after 25 minutes.  He had a CT scan of his torso
which was negative.  Blood cultures were sent and he was
started on Levofloxacin.

On [**4-8**], he was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit.
At this point, neurologically, he was having episodes of
agitation and confusion.  This was treated with Haldol.

Over the next few days, his pulmonary status gradually
improved; the wheezing episodes decreased.  His confusion
started dissolving.  On [**2179-4-2**], he was transferred out to
the Regular Floor.  On [**2179-4-13**], postoperative day 14, his
condition was stable.  Neurologically, he was oriented and
appropriately responsive.  His pacing wires were
discontinued.  Rehabilitation Screening was started as it was
felt that he was stable enough to go to rehabilitation at
this point.
