Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiography


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78764**] is a [**Age over 90 **]M with history of atrial fibrillation c/b
iliac thrombus and chronic GIB who was admitted with right-sided
abdominal pain, swelling, and dyspnea.  On admission, he was
found to have Hct of 16 and a rectus sheath hematoma. He had
been on levonox 60BID following recent admission for left iliac
thrombus. He was initially admitted to the vascular service and
required transfusion of 4 units PRBCs and 2 units FFP. He had an
angiography showing no evidence of active bleeding.

His hospital course was complicated by a troponin leak to 0.14
(in the setting of Cr elevation to 1.5). Cardiology consult was
called and recommended medical management.  Upon transfer to the
medicine service, he had no complaints, denying CP, SOB,
abdominal pain, lightheadedness/dizziness, recent bleeding.

[**2199-5-20**] EKG:
Atrial fibrillation. Ventricular premature beats. Consider prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Baseline artifact. Low QRS
voltage in the limb leads. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2199-5-2**] the ventricular premature beats and artifact are new.

[**2199-5-20**] CXR IMPRESSION: Layering right pleural effusion.

[**2199-5-20**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. Large right rectus sheath hematoma as described with
posterior extension into the extraperitoneal and intraperitoneal
portions of the anterior pelvis. CT with contrast may be
performed to evaluate for active extravasation.
2. Large right pleural effusion with right lower lobe
compressive atelectasis.
3. Small amount of abdominal ascites.
4. Pancreatic calcifications, raising the possibility of chronic
pancreatitis.
5. Right renal hypodensities, likely represent cysts.

[**2199-5-22**] LE ULTRASOUNDS:
No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.

[**2199-5-28**] TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-5-2**],
left ventricular function appears similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rectus sheath hematoma
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78765**] presented with abdominal pain and swelling and was
found to have a large right sided rectus sheath hematoma and
significant drop in his hematocrit. He underwent angiography
that showed no active bleeding. The vascular surgery service
evaluated the patient and felt that no operative intervention
was required and conservative management was most appropriate.
His abdominal discomfort and hematoma size were improved at time
of discharge.

2. Atrial fibrillation
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78765**] on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on admission for rate
control; it was titrated to 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with HR in the 50 -
60's.  He was changed to metoprolol XL 50 mg QD prior to
discharge with stable HR and BP.  The risks vs. benefits were
discussed at length with the patient, and he decided to restart
warfarin given the stroke risk.  A lower INR goal of 2.0 - 2.5
was chosen given his history of bleeding, and he was discharged
on warfarin 2 mg QHS.

3. Congestive heart failure, systolic, acute on chronic
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78765**] was total body volume overloaded in the setting of
receiving blood products for his anemia. An echocardiogram was
obtained which showed a preserved ejection fraction with
moderate TR and MR as seen in prior studies. He was diuresed
with lasix with good effect. He was discharged on metoprolol and
lisinopril, as well as standing lasix 40 mg PO QD.  He was
euvolemic upon discharge.

4. Coronary artery disease with demand ischemia
His troponin was mildly elevated to peak of 0.14, likely demand
ischemia due to anemia and poor rate control early in admission.
He will continue metoprolol, simvastatin, and lisinopril.  He
was on aspirin prior to admission for a history of NSTEMI,
although this was held in house while the patient was bleeding
into his rectus shealth.  Aspirin 81 mg should be restarted once
INR is stabilized and the rectus sheath hematoma is stable at
the therapeutic INR.

5. Hypertension
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78765**] was started on lisinopril, metoprolol, and
amlodipine for blood pressure control with good effect; BP was
in the 110-120's/50-60's upon discharge.

INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO REHAB FACILITY FOR FOLLOW-UP:
(1) Mr. [**Known lastname 78764**] should have his INR measured for a goal of 2.0 -
2.5 (lower goal range given patient's history of bleeding).
Please measure on [**2199-6-12**] and adjust warfarin dose appropriately
(he was discharged on warfarin). Please check INR every two days
until stable.
(2) Please weigh patient daily and adjust lasix as appropriate
to keep weight stable.
(3) The patient was on aspirin prior to this hospital admission.
Please restart aspirin 81 mg QD by the end of the week once INR
is stable in range 2.0-2.5 and there is no evidence of worsening
of the rectus sheath hematoma with anticoagulation.

Medications on Admission:
Enoxaparin 60 mg SC bid, lisinopril 5, omeprazole 20,
simvastatin 40, Lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **], aspirin 81, Lasix 20 daily,
