Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
AAA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right iliofemoral conduit placement and SMA-ilio
right and left renal artery bypasses with ligation of the
origin of the SMA and right and left renal arteries.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69-year-old gentleman with a tender 6.3 cm
thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm who has extensive COPD and
prior right and left lung surgery who was not felt to be a
candidate for an open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.
Therefore he is undergoing visceral and renal debranching in
preparation for stent grafting of the entire aorta. Due to
the complexity of the procedure, two attending surgeons were
required.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

ABDOMEN U.S. (PORTABLE)  [**2102-12-22**] 11:21 AM

FINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.
There is no biliary dilatation and the common duct measures 0.2
cm. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The
gallbladder is partially filled with sludge, but there are no
signs of cholecystitis. The pancreas is mostly obscured by
overlying bowel gas. The spleen is not imaged on this exam. The
right kidney measures 11.1 cm and the left kidney measures 10.4
cm. There is no hydronephrosis and no solid masses are
identified in either kidney. There is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm
simple cyst identified in the lower pole of the right kidney.
There is no ascites identified but there is a right pleural
effusion seen.

Grayscale and Doppler images of the aorta in the midline are
very limited due to the patient's overlying bowel gas. There is
some flow in the aorta, but it is difficult to assess. At its
widest diameter, the aorta measures 4.2 x 4.5 cm. The surgical
graft is not identified on this examination. Arterial flow is
identified in the right kidney with appropriate waveforms in the
hilum. No flow is identified in the left kidney, but this may be
due to the fact that the left kidney is more difficult to
visualize.

IMPRESSION:

1. Very limited views of the aorta show some flow within it.
Evaluation of the graft is not possible on this examination due
to the patient's abdominal distention and bowel gas.

2. Sludge in the gallbladder with no signs of cholecystitis.

3. Right pleural effusion.

[**2102-12-21**] 12:37 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest (two exposures to cover
entire chest area) were obtained with the patient in supine
position and analyzed in direct comparison with a similar
preceding study of [**2102-12-19**]. The heart size remains
within normal limits. The thoracic aorta is identified including
the bulging portion in the distal lower portion of the thoracic
aorta, which previously had been identified at the beginning
site of the thoraco-abdominal aneurysm. On previous examination,
linear atelectatic markings of the left lung have regressed
markedly and there is no suspicion for any remaining major
atelectasis or pulmonary infiltrates surrounding the repaired
aneurysmatic area. Also, the right basal densities have
decreased and the right lateral pleural sinus is free. No new
parenchymal infiltrates are identified and no evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestive pattern exists. No pneumothorax.
Previously described right jugular approach central venous line
in unchanged position terminating overlying the superior
mediastinum at the second anterior rib junction.

Markedly improved postoperative chest. Lateral view could give
information concerning possibly remaining posterior pleural
fluid.

4. Small simple cyst in the right kidney

[**2102-12-21**] 2:56 PM

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed. There is
normal compression, color flow, waveforms, and augmentation.
There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the lower
extremities.

[**2102-12-21**] 5:50 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: assess anastomotic sites/ assess for infiltrates/ fluid
[**Last Name (un) **]

FINDINGS: Significant increase in mediastinal lymph node size is
present at all mediastinal and hilar stations including the
right upper paratracheal, from 4.4 to 9 mm, right lower
paratracheal, from 4 to 10 mm and from 5 to 11 mm, and in
subcarinal area, from 7 to 16 mm. This increase might be
reactive to infection and/or aspiration new since both the
[**11-15**] CT and chest radiograph earlier today, specifically
right perihilar, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe areas
of peribronchial infiltration and more peripheral
consolidations. The airways are patent to the level of
subsegmental bronchi but endobronchial secretions in the
bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe and segmental bronchi
might represent aspiration.

Left lower lobe linear opacity most likely is due to atelectasis
secondary to small pleural effusion. The right pleural effusion
is also noted, small as well. The patient is after right lower
lobe surgery, most likely wedge.

The heart size is enlarged with small pericardial effusion,
nonhemorrhagic, new compared to [**2102-11-15**]. Myocardial
density is significantly higher than the density of the blood in
the left ventricle suggesting anemia. Large thoracic aortic
aneurysm up to 6.7 cm in diameter is grossly unchanged, 6.5 cm
on the previous study, representing known fusiform thoracic
aortic aneurysm.

The imaged portion of the upper abdomen is limited for
evaluation due to the absence of oral and IV contrast. The
gall
