CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old man
with multiple myeloma status post autologous BMT day plus 54
who presents with 1-day history of fever to 101.6 degrees
proceeded by a sore throat and mild runny nose.  He denies
any sinus congestion, dysuria, increased urinary frequency,
constipation, or diarrhea.  He denies any sick contacts or
recent travel.

Mr. [**Known lastname 9810**] was diagnosed with IgG and multiple myeloma on
[**8-3**] when he presented with a T4 through T6 vertebral body
collapse.  Bone marrow biopsy was diagnostic for multiple
myeloma.  He was initially treated with local radiotherapy,4
cycles of VAD chemotherapy and  then a autologous stem cell
transplant.

The patient received high-dose Cytoxan for stem cell
mobilization.  He underwent autologous peripheral stem cell
transplant in [**1-3**].  He is currently day 54 status post this
transplant.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma.

Coronary artery disease status post CABG.

Vertebral compression fracture.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking 3 to 5 years ago.
He denies history of alcohol use.  He is married and lives at
home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has a daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100 degrees, blood
pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 18, saturating 89 percent
on room air.  HEENT:  PERRL, EOMI, and moist mucous
membranes.  Neck:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No jugular
venous distension.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2.  Chest:  Decreased breath sounds
bilaterally at bases.  Mild crackles bilaterally.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Neurological:  The
patient was alert and oriented x 2.  Cranial nerves II
through XII intact.  Extremities:  No edema, no clubbing, and
no cyanosis.  DP and PT pulses were 2 plus bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs were significant for a
platelet count of 88 and a white blood cell count of 8.8.
Chem-7 was unremarkable.  LFTs were unremarkable.  Lactate
was elevated at 2.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Bone Marrow
Transplant Service for further management.  He was initially
started on levofloxacin and continued on his prednisone.  The
etiology of the patient's fevers were unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] was
started on cefepime in addition to his levofloxacin on
[**2123-3-5**].  Again, the patient remained febrile, spiking
fevers to 101.5 degrees.  Infectious Disease consults and
Pulmonary consults were obtained.  The patient underwent
multiple attempts to give a sputum sample, which were
unsuccessful.  He then went for a bronchoscopy.  The first
bronchoscopy washings, Gram stain, and culture were all
nondiagnostic.  The patient underwent a CT scan of his chest
on [**2123-3-7**].  This revealed multiple patchy opacities in the
right upper lobe representing progression of pneumonia.  He
also had a large bilateral pleural effusion.  He had
extensive osseus involvement with multiple myeloma.  Because
the first bronchoscopy was nondiagnostic, the patient
underwent the procedure again.  This bronchoscopy was
positive for respiratory syncytial virus.  Acid fast smear
was negative.  Potassium hydroxide preparation showed no
fungus.  Testing for pneumocystis carinii was negative.  Gram
stains were unremarkable.  Legionella culture was negative.
Cryptococcal antigen was negative.  The patient also had
multiple blood cultures during his hospitalization all of
which were negative.  The bronchoscopy was  positive for RSV.
He was  transferred to the MICU for ribavirin therapy starting on
[**2123-3-11**]. During this time, the patient's antibiotic regimen
consisted of cefepime 2 mg twice daily, levofloxacin, and
voriconazole. In addition, he was on vancomycin.  The patient
completed his ribavirin therapy and was transferred back to the
floor at which time he showed marked improvement.

ONCOLOGY:  The patient was status post autologous stem cell
transplant for multiple myeloma.  During his hospital stay
his white blood cell count dropped most likely
secondary to the viral infection.  With control of his
infection his white blood cell count slowly began to rise
and  at the time of discharge it was 3.3.  It had been as low as
1.3.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was continued on his outpatient
medications, which included metoprolol.  His blood pressure
was well controlled on this regimen.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient was scheduled for a follow-up to see
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] as an outpatient.
