Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
Spanish-speaking only woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes with recurrence of
atrial fibrillation.

Her symptoms started three days prior to admission when the
patient began to experience a racing heart, chest
palpitations, excessive fatigue, and some shortness of
breath.  She denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers,
chills, or upper respiratory infection symptoms.  The patient
did report a chronic cough productive of mucous times years;
consistent with post nasal drip.

The patient reports she has had similar symptoms of
palpitations and fatigue three years ago when she first went
into atrial fibrillation.  She required cardioversion at that
time.  She has not had any symptoms since then until now.

At baseline, she has orthopnea.  Although she only sleeps on
one pillow, she feels like she is "drowning" when lying flat.
She has not experienced pedal edema until the few days prior
to admission.  She is usually able to climb multiple flights
of stairs, but in the past few days even a few flights of
stairs are difficult.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  A chronic cough.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Insulin 90 units subcutaneously q.a.m. and 90 units
subcutaneously q.p.m.
3.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.

ALLERGIES:  IODINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol use.
She is currently not working and lives with her husband
(telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 109771**]).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed temperature was 97.5, heart rate was
76, blood pressure was 102/60, oxygen saturation was 79% on
room air and 93% on a nonrebreather mask.  Weight was 81.3
kilograms.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the patient had 8 cm of jugular venous distention.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements were intact.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm.  A
26holosystolic murmur.  The lungs revealed bilateral
crackles.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Extremities revealed trace edema in feet.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Significant
laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was
13.4 and hematocrit was 41.4.  Chemistry-7 was within normal
limits.  Bicarbonate was 26.  INR was 1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A chest x-ray was done in the Emergency
Department which demonstrated cardiomegaly with congestive
heart failure pulmonary edema.  In addition, a possible
thyroid goiter was seen at the thoracic inlet.

Myocardial infarction was considered a possible cause for the
patient's atrial fibrillation and subsequent pulmonary edema.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled.  Her peak creatine kinase was
61.  Her peak troponin was 1.1.

The patient was started on an aspirin q.d. and was initially
maintained on a heparin drip until ruling out.  She was
started on a nitroglycerin drip, Lasix, and Zaroxolyn for
diuresis.  Due to a history of amiodarone side effects
characterized by vivid nightmares, dofetilide was started
with b.i.d. electrocardiogram checks to look for Q-T
prolongation.  The patient was cardioverted in the Emergency
Department and converted.  She was admitted to the C-MED
Service at that time.

An arterial blood gas was done to evaluate the source of the
patient's hypoxia.  On room air, pH was 7.43, PCO2 was 36,
and PO2 was 46.  On a nonrebreather mask, pH was 7.44, PCO2
was 39, and PO2 was 78.  Aggressive diuresis was initiated.

The patient's borderline white blood cell count and
productive cough were thought to be suggestive of pneumonia;
however, the patient was afebrile, and the cough had been
chronic for years.  Therefore, she was not started on
antibiotics.

Thyroid function tests were checked as a possibly etiology
for the patient's recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal at 1.4 and free T4 was
8.9.

Within several hours of the first dose of dofetilide, the
patient went into torsade de pointes and respiratory arrest.
She was shocked with 200 joules and went back into a normal
sinus rhythm.  She vomited several times and was then
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit where she was monitored
and stabilized.  The dofetilide was discontinued.

Initially, she had had several asymptomatic runs of
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia on telemetry prior to the
sustained ventricular tachycardia when the patient became
unresponsive and cyanotic, and a code was called.  After the
event in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient had a few
additional runs of symptomatic polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia.  In the Coronary Care Unit, she was monitored
and diuresed.  She was started on lidocaine briefly which was
later discontinued.

She was transferred back to the C-MED Service.  An
echocardiogram was done which demonstrated an ejection
fraction of 25% to 30%.  Wall motion abnormalities included
basilar septal, inferior, and medial apical, posterolateral
akinesis with preservation of the lateral wall.
Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation was seen (3+).  There
was also borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
noted.

A cardiac catheterization was done to evaluate for the source
of hypokinesis.  The patient was in ventricular bigeminy
throughout the case with a wedge pressure of 15, cardiac
output of 3.7, and an index of 1.9.  Severe global
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction calculated to be 20%
and 2+ mitral regurgitation.  The left main coronary artery
was angiographically normal.  The left anterior descending
artery had a proximal 50% stenosis and distal 70% lesion.
There was a large dominant right coronary artery with a 40%
medial vessel and 40% distal lesion.  In general, there was
severely depressed ventricular function with mild coronary
artery disease.

The patient's oxygen saturations improved to 98% on room air
on the day of discharge.  The patient remained in a normal
sinus rhythm and was started on amiodarone, to be followed as
an outpatient.  The patient was to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks and receive [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor
in two weeks to monitor heart rate and Q-T while on
amiodarone.  The patient was also scheduled to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the Heart Failure Clinic on [**2113-1-10**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3.  Warfarin 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2.  Torsade de pointes secondary to dofetilide.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
