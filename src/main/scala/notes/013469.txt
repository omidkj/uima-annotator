Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the MICU with respiratory distress
presumed secondary to underlying lung disease along with a new
pneumonia. Unfortunately, Mrs.[**Known lastname 108983**] progressive respiratory
failure was refractory to ventilatory efforts and antibiotic
management and she passed away.

1. PNA: Again, the patient's pneumonia caused her acute
respiratory failure. It was a presumed community-aquired
pneumonia, but antibiotics were broadened to cover MRSA and
gram-negative organisms. She was continued on Vancomycin HCl
1000 mg IV Q12H, Metronidazole 500 mg IV Q8H, Azithromycin 500
mg IV Q24H, Aztreonam 1000 mg IV Q8H. Blood cultures and sputum
cultures were unremarkable.

2. Resp Failure: As the patient did not with to be intubated,
she was ventilated on BiPAP with suboptimal results. She had
several episodes of agitation and required sedation to decrease
her work of breathing and increase her level of comfort. The
causes of her respiratory failure were a combination of PNA as
well as her underlying COPD/Restrictive Lung Disease (Congenital
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]). She was also continued on albuterol and
atrovent nebs. Her outpatient pulmonologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD)
also followed her throughout her course.

3. Myasthenia: Pt had known congenital MG. She was followed by
Neuro for her course. They recommened no 3,4-DAP or
Pyridostigmine for concern of worsening her resp status (along
with avoiding CCBs, Mg2+, Quinidine-derivitives and
Aminoglycosides). She was initially started on dexamethasone 3
mg IV Q8H, but this was tapered off as the benefit of this was
unclear with her MG subtype.
