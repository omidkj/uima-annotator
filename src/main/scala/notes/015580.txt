History of Present Illness:
72yo woman w/ lung CA, breast CA, recently diagnosed pancreatic
CA, COPD, HTN, GERD, who presents with multiple complaints.  The
patient was recently hospitalized from [**7-11**] to [**7-21**] for fever
post-ERCP (had ERCP in [**Month (only) 116**], brushings returned positive for
malignant cells, patient returned for f/u ERCP).  During that
hospitalization, she developed an ileus and had an abdominal CT
scan which showed a pancreatic head mass consistent with
adenoCA.  She also developed fevers and tachypnea and was
treated for a post-obstructive pneumonia, initially moxifloxacin
and flagyl, which was then broadened to vanco/cefepime on which
she was discharged to finish a 14 day course of abx.  She was
also noted to have a portal vein thrombosis with encasement of
the SMV that was treated with a heparin gtt with transition to
lovenox.  During that admission, she also developed word finding
difficulty which was concerning for an acute stroke - MRI was
declined for further workup as the husband wished to focus more
on palliation and comfort.  She also had issues with [**Last Name (un) **],
urinary retention.  She was discharged to a [**Hospital1 1501**] with plan to
transition to hospice, however she had labs that were drawn that
were concerning and she was sent back to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  Of note, she had a pending urine culture that is
now growing >100,000 enterococci and yeast.  Per her husband,
her mental status has not improved since being at rehab and she
has been non-communicative.

In the ED, initial vs were: 97.1 70 96/63 20 98% RA.  Patient
had a CXR which showed evidence of a pneumonia.  UA was grossly
positive.  Labs showed WBC to 22, AP to 588, LDH of 276, Tbili
of 1.7, Cr of 2.9.  She was given 500 cc NS, cefepime, and
levofloxacin 750mg x1.  She triggered for HR 160s which was
thought to be secondary to pain.  She was given morphine 4mg IV
which brought her HR back to 130s and RR to 18.

Imaging:
=================
CXR [**2142-7-23**]:
FINDINGS: Bedside radiograph of the chest redemonstrates a large
ovoid right thoracic mass. Note is also made of a Port-A-Cath,
which terminates in the upper cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes
have improved from the comparison study, though bibasilar
opacities persist, likely atelectatic. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours are normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo woman w/ lung CA, breast CA, recently diagnosed pancreatic
CA, COPD, HTN, GERD, presented to the ED with multiple issues,
found to have UTI.

Brief hospital course:  The patient was admitted to the ICU for
management of hypotension, acute renal failure, urinary tract
infection and post-obstructive pneumonia. She was treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics. She remained persistently
hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   Given her poor prognosis due to the acute issues in addition
to the multiple underlying malignancies, the palliative care
service was consulted. After discussion between the palliative
care team and the patient's husband, a decision was made to
pursue Ms. [**Known lastname 89335**] comfort as the primary goal.  The patient was
placed on concentrated morphine oral solution and received IV
morphine to keep her comfortable. Other medical interventions
were discontinued. She was transferred out of the ICU on [**7-25**]
and passed away peacefully at 5:50 am on the morning of [**2142-7-26**].
