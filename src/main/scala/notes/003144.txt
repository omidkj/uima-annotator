HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old
woman initially transferred from [**Hospital6 4620**] to
the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 188**] for management of pneumonia and respiratory failure.
The patient has multiple medical problems to include
schizophrenia, dementia, Parkinson's Disease, and atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was status post right above the
knee amputation on [**2-17**], at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Hospital **]
Hospital.  Following this procedure, she was transferred to
[**Hospital 110826**] Health and Rehabilitation Center.

While at the rehabilitation center, the patient was noted to
be febrile to 103.2 F.,  diaphoretic and short of breath.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital6 4620**] for
further work-up.  At that hospital, she was noted to be
hypertensive, tachycardic, tachypneic, with a decreased
oxygen saturation.  Chest x-ray disclosed evidence for right
upper lobe, left lower lobe infiltrates.  Therefore, the
patient was intubated and pan cultured; given a dose of
Zosyn.  Her labs were notable for an elevated white blood
cell count at 23.8.  Chemistries were notable for
hypernatremia with a sodium of 155, an elevated BUN and
creatinine 48, 1.0.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management of her respiratory failure.  On
presentation to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 346**], the patient's temperature was 101.2
F.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, a chronically ill
appearing female lying in bed, intubated.  Vital signs were

92; respiratory status - the patient on assist control
ventilation, total volume 400, respiratory rate 12, FIO2
100%, PEEP 5, O2 saturation 96%.  HEENT:  The pupils are
sluggish,  Periorbital burn scar.  Endotracheal tube in
place.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Neck with left IJ line in
place.  Heart is irregularly irregular, S1, S2, no murmurs,

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray with aspiration versus multifocal
pneumonia with consolidations in the left lower lobe and
right lower lobe, endotracheal tube in place.  Left internal
jugular venous catheter tip within the left brachiocephalic
vein.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 78 year old woman with multiple
medical problems including atrial fibrillation, dementia, and
schizophrenia, transferred from [**Hospital3 1196**] to
[**Hospital1 69**] for management of
respiratory failure.  Chest x-ray notable for right lower
lobe and left lower lobe infiltrates.

Labs significant for hypernatremia and elevated white count.

PLAN:
1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient initially was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of her
respiratory failure thought to be secondary to aspiration
pneumonia.  The patient remained on assist control mechanical
ventilation.  Sputum culture was obtained.  She was continued
on Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage.  She continued on
Albuterol, Atrovent nebulizer treatments.  Her sputum culture
grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; therefore,
on the subsequent day, Vancomycin was added to the patient's
regimen.

The patient was also noted to have a Klebsiella urinary tract
infection.  The Klebsiella was initially thought to be beta
lactamase resistant, so the patient was changed to meropenem
and Vancomycin.  The patient self extubated on [**3-4**],
her respiratory status improved.  She was weaned off
supplemental oxygen.  The patient was transferred to the
Medical Floor on [**3-4**].

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As noted above, the patient was
noted to have a Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia and a klebsiella urinary tract infection.  There
was also concern about possible postoperative infection of
the patient's right stump.

The Infectious Disease Service was involved in managing the
patient's antibiotic regimen.  As noted above, the patient
remained on Vancomycin for her Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  The patient is to complete
a three week course of treatment for this pneumonia.

Regarding the patient's Klebsiella urinary tract infection,
initially it was thought that the Klebsiella was beta
lactamase resistant; however, further sensitivities revealed
that this organism was sensitive to Ceftriaxone.

On [**3-4**], however, the patient developed a peripheral
eosinophilia.  The Infectious Disease Service thought that
this reaction might be due to beta lactin antibiotics;
therefore, the patient was changed from ceftriaxone to
Aztreonam.  The patient to complete a two week course of
Aztreonam for her Klebsiella urinary tract infection.

Given persistently elevated white count, the patient
underwent a CT scan of her right stump to rule out the
presence of a fluid collection.  No focal fluid collection
was identified within the right lower extremity.

Finally, on [**3-5**], the patient was noted to have
Candiduria.  The patient's Foley catheter was changed.  She
was started on a seven day course of fluconazole.

3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:   On admission, the
patient was noted to be hypernatremic with a sodium of 155.
The patient was thought to be volume depleted.  She was
hydrated and given free water boluses for her PEG tube.  The
patient was also maintained on her tube feeds and a nutrition
consultation was obtained for assistance with tube feeds.
