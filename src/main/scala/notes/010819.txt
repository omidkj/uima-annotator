HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 84-year-old woman,
who is admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2145-2-22**] with
9/10 substernal chest pain and shortness of breath at rest
while at [**Hospital 38**] Rehab Facility.  At [**Hospital1 1474**], the patient
was found to be in congestive heart failure with elevated
troponin of 4.1.  She was given sublingual nitroglycerin and
Lasix with relief of symptoms.  She was also started on
Lovenox.  Her initial EKG was normal sinus rhythm without any
ST-T wave changes.

An echocardiogram the day after admission there revealed an
ejection fraction of 20% and severe hypokinesis as well as
critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.6 cm squared.
Two days after admission to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, the patient
developed 10/10 chest pain with diaphoresis and ST elevations
on EKG in leads V2 through V6 with ST depressions in the
inferior leads.  The patient was given three sublingual
nitroglycerin, Lopressor, Morphine with relief of chest pain.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cardiac
catheterization.

Upon arrival here, the patient states that she is chest pain
free, although complains of intermittent shortness of breath
with minimal exertion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.
2. Critical aortic stenosis.
3. Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
4. Coronary artery disease status post multiple MIs.
5. Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Aspirin.
2. Plavix 75 mg q.d.
3. Zocor 10 mg q.d.
4. Lovenox 90 mg subq b.i.d.
5. Hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d.
6. Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
7. Nitro paste 1" q.6h.
8. Lasix 60 mg IV q.d.
9. Ultram 75 mg b.i.d.
10. Atrovent inhaler.

ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor leads to hyperkalemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with daughter in [**Name (NI) 5110**].  No
history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Patient is afebrile with a blood
pressure of 131/53, pulse 93, respiratory rate of 16, and
100% oxygen saturation on 3 liters by nasal cannula.  In
general, the patient is a well appearing female in no
apparent distress.  She has no jugular venous distention up
to 10 cm.  On lung exam, she has rales halfway up on the
right and a quarter of the way up on the left with expiratory
wheezes.  Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1, S2 with
a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal
border with a loud S2 and a displaced PMI.  There is also a
[**1-14**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Abdomen is benign.
Extremities showed 2+ pedal edema up to the knees.  Skin
shows no rashes.  Neurologically, the patient is intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC shows a white count of 6.7,
hematocrit of 29.3, and normal platelet count.  Coags show an
elevated INR of 1.4.  Chemistries on admission show a
creatinine of 1.3, BUN of 33, sodium of 131, and an elevated
bicarbonate of 32.  CPK on admission was 441 with a
troponin-T of 0.36 and a CK-MB of 27.

Chest x-ray showed mild CHF and patchy left lower lobe
opacity.

EKG showed ectopic atrial rhythm at 106 beats per minute with
ST depressions in the inferior leads and ST elevations in V3
to V6 and I in aVL.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Coronary artery disease:  The patient was found to have ST
elevation MI on admission.  She was offered emergent cardiac
catheterization, however, after discussion with the family,
the patient and the family decided against intervention.  She
was medically managed with Heparin and Integrilin for
anticoagulation initially.  She was then changed over to
Lovenox.  The Integrilin and Heparin were discontinued after
her CK peaked at 1800 the day after admission.  Patient was
also maintained on aspirin, Plavix, and beta-blocker.
Initially, she was started on a statin, however, this was
discontinued prior to her discharge as she is going home for
hospice care.

2. Congestive heart failure:  The patient was found to be in
mild congestive heart failure on admission.  She was gently
diuresed with Lasix.  She is also digoxin for inotropy.  Upon
discharge the patient was on a regimen of 60 mg of Lasix q.d.


3. Aortic stenosis:  The patient had critical aortic stenosis
on admission, however, she declined any surgery or any
intervention.  She was medically managed with afterload
reduction with the medications mentioned above.

4. Rhythm:  Patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation,
however, EKG was more consistent with a wandering atrial
pacemaker as she was rate controlled on digoxin and
beta-blockade.

5. Diabetes:  Initially, the patient was on a sliding scale
of insulin.  She was then started on oral hypoglycemics for
better blood glucose control.  This was titrated up slightly,
however, consideration was given to the fact that the patient
was not eating too much and likely would continue to have a
decreased appetite after returning home as she became more
ill.

6. Code status:  During the hospital admission, after
discussion with the patient and her family, the patient was
made DNR/DNI.  It was also agreed as there would be no
intervention for her cardiac disease per her wishes, that she
would be most comfortable by going home with hospice care at
home.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged home with
hospice care.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient is in good condition.  She is
