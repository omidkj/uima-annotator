Service:  MICU

ADDENDUM TO MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT HOSPITAL COURSE BY
PROBLEM:

1.  Respiratory failure:  As mentioned in the previous
discharge summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a tracheostomy and was
maintained on a ventilator with pressure support.  This was
slowly weaned, and by the time of discharge, she was
tolerating a tracheostomy mask throughout the day and was
rested on the ventilator with pressure support of 5 and PEEP
of 5 overnight.  Most of the inability to wean her from her
ventilator was felt to be secondary to anxiety as she did
well all throughout the day when off the ventilator.  Her
dependency on the ventilator will be further weaned at
rehabilitation.  It was felt that her respiratory failure was
most likely a combination of volume overload, which improved
with diuresis, and her muscular weakness, and possibly
respiratory suppression due to her metabolic alkalosis.

2.  Renal failure:  She continued to be followed by the Renal
Consult Team and was maintained on her tacrolimus and
mycophenolate mofetil with frequent monitoring of FK506
levels.  She was also maintained on Epogen two times per week
and ferrous sulfate.  At the time of discharge, her
creatinine was ranging from 1.8 to 2, and it was felt that
this was secondary to her extreme diuresis over the preceding
days with a resultant volume contraction.  It is recommended
that this be followed up as an outpatient and strictly
monitored by her transplant doctor.

3.  Volume status:  As mentioned in the previous discharge
summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was extremely volume overloaded on
transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and her weight
was up to 90 kg from 65 kg on dry weight.  She was
successfully diuresed throughout her admission.  She was
diuresis with a dopamine drip, Lasix drip, and albumin.  She
was frequency monitored by the Renal Team.  There was
difficulty with her dopamine secondary to hypotension when
the dopamine was turned off, however, on [**9-16**], her
dopamine and Lasix dose were successfully weaned and she was
diuresing on her own.

At this point, her albumin was also stopped.  At one point,
she had been placed on metolazone at 2.5 mg b.i.d., however,
this was only maintained for several days, and was
discontinued secondary to metabolic alkalosis from volume
contraction.  She was started on acetazolamide 250 mg b.i.d.
on [**9-15**] to further facilitate diuresis, but mostly to
help with her contraction alkalosis.  She was also started on
Sinemet in an effort to facilitate weaning from the dopamine
drip and it was felt that Sinemet could possibly replete her
body source of presynaptic dopamine and facilitate weaning
from the dopamine drip.

She will not be sent to rehabilitation on Sinemet on her own
and had begun to have a decrease in urine output which was
felt to be secondary to over diuresis and resultant
dehydration.  She was bolused between 50 cc of normal saline
several times to facilitate bicarbonate excretions, and for
slight volume replacement.

At discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic to partially dry.
She will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the Department of
Cardiology for further maintenance of her heart failure.

3.  Diabetes:  As mentioned above in the previous discharge
summary, she was maintained on a sliding scale insulin with
six doses of glargine for maintenance of her diabetes.  She
also was monitored frequency with q.i.d. fingersticks.

4.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition/GI:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
maintained on tube feeds through her percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy that was placed while admitted, at goal.  She
occasionally suffered from nausea, which was felt to be
secondary to her gastroparesis, which was relieved with the
Zofran.  Her husband brought in medicine by the name of
Motilium that she had been on at home for her gastroparesis,
however, due to recommendations by the Heart Failure Team,
and Renal Team, this medicine was not continued due to risk
of cardiac arrhythmia.  She was continually passing stools,
and with minimal nausea, therefore, she was just maintained
with antiemetics.

5.  Psychiatry:  As mentioned above in previous discharge
summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] suffered from anxiety and limited
mobility throughout her admission.  She was followed by the
Psychiatry Consult Service who initially recommended using
Ativan for anxiety control.  This worked with good effect,
however, it was felt that she still had a depressed mood, and
>........<.  The day prior to discharge, she was started on
Zyprexa 1.25 mg b.i.d. in hopes that this was alleviate her
anxiety condition in addition to serving as a mood
stabilizer.  The use of antidepressants have been discussed
multiple times with the patient and her husband, both of whom
refused, and felt uncomfortable using antidepressants.  She
agreed to use the Zyprexa, as did her husband, and she will
be discharged with Zyprexa 1.25 mg b.i.d.

6.  HSV 2/Anal lesions:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] received a ten day
course of acyclovir for her perianal HSV2 lesions, which were
improving at the time of discharge.  She had been seen by
Dermatology while admitted with recommendations of acyclovir.

7.  Communication:  Throughout her hospital stay, the plan
and her status was communicated with the patient frequently
and with her husband.  They were both aware of the plan of
care, and her husband is extremely active in her care.  As
expressed multiple times by the patient and her husband that
they did not feel comfortable with her going back to
[**Hospital3 **] after discharge due to alleged
neglect on the previous admission.  They prefer that the
patient go to [**Hospital1 **], or some other rehabilitation
facility.
