HISTORY:  Briefly, the patient was a 50-year-old female with
a significant past medical history of breast cancer, status
post BMT, subsequent development of MDS and status post
second BMT with a recent prolonged and complicated hospital
course previously described who was admitted to the medical
ICU service with pseudomonal pneumonia and sepsis.  Her ICU
course was complicated by progressive respiratory failure,
DIC, and upper GI bleed.

During the course of her hospitalization, the patient was
weaned off sedation, but was noted to be unresponsive several
days after being off sedating medicines.  A subsequent CT
head showed evidence of a large left MCA stroke.  The patient
was evaluated by both neurology and neurosurgery, thought
that there were no immediate operative indications.  After a
long discussion with the patient's family, decision was made
to make the patient CMO.  She was started on a morphine drip
and extubated, and subsequently passed away on [**2188-12-15**].
