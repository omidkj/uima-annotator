Stress test - No significant ST segment changes noted and no
anginal type
symptoms reported with Persantine. Appropriate hemodynamic
response.
Nuclear report filed separately.

PMIBI - No focal myocardial perfusion defect identified on
stress or rest images. Left ventricular ejection fraction 47%

Vein - The greater saphenous veins are patent bilaterally.
Please see
digitized image on PACS for formal sequential measurements. The
vessels
appear to be patent from the saphenofemoral junction through to
the level of the ankle.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63-year-old male with thoracic and
aortic aneurysms was who is status post thoracic aneurysm
repair, had embolization from an ectatic popliteal artery to his
digital vessels. He was treated with anticoagulation and
stabilized over the course of several weeks. We also did not
want to perform an operation because he had a spinal cord
ischemia with hypotension during thoracic aneurysm repair and
was starting to recover.  He was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1720**]
surgical service on [**2159-11-29**]. He was maintained on lovenox.
PMIBI/cardiac clearance was obtained prior to surgery. His
procedures were diagnostic angiogram on [**2159-12-3**] and L profunda
to posterior tibial artery bypass graft with in situ saphenous
vein, angioscopy, vein inspection, valve lysis on [**2159-12-6**]. No
complications to the procedure. He was kept on our pathway and
had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Physical therapy
cleared for home. Patient to be discharged home on [**2159-12-11**] with
[**Name (NI) 269**], PT and health aide. His following hospital course can be
summarized by the review of systems -

Neuro - Patient pain was well controlled with percocet. He had
no neurological issues during this hospitalization

Cardio - Followed closely by Atrius cardiology and consulted for
cardiac clearance. Chemical stress test on [**2159-11-30**] revealed no
focal myocardial perfusion defect with ventricular ejection
fraction of 47%. He was maintained on all his home medications
with adjustment per cardiology. His discharge dosing will be
Lopressor 50mg PO QID and Amlodipine 2.5 mg PO daily. He will
continue his statin and aspirin.

Pulm: No respiratory issues. He is discharged on room air and no
oxygen requirements.

GI: Maintained on H2B. Diet advanced as tolerated per pathway.
No issues.

GU: His home medication, Tolterodine, was resumed for overactive
bladder. No issues with hematuria or incontinence. Foley was
removed POD2 and urinated without difficulty.

Heme: He had been found to have a thrombosed popliteal artery
aneurysm which had showered emboli distally into his foot. He
had been on lovenox and a heparin gtt for systemic
anticoagulation prior to the surgery, but because he has now
undergone bypass of the popliteal aneurysm, there is no further
need for system anticoagulation. Accordingly, lovenox/heparin
gtt have not been resumed after surgery. This plan has been
formulated with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], attending vascular surgeon. He
will continue his aspirin.

ID: Given preoperative antibiotics and was not continued
postoperatively. Patient remained afebrile throughout this
hospital course.

Endo: Since his admission from rehab, he was maintained on a
sliding scale of insulin in addition to his metformin. Metformin
was held prior to angiogram procedure to prevent any
nephropathy. This was resumed on day of discharge with strict
blood sugar monitoring. He will follow up with his PCP regarding
any further antiglycemic agents. Home health aide will be
assigned to assist with blood glucose checks.

Dispo: Physical therapy continually working with patient.
Cleared to be discharged home.
