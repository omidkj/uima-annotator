Ativan / Tetracycline

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain/ positive blood cultures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous line, attepmted IR guided [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**] cathether x 2
(second successful), intubation

History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with ESRD on HD, DM, history of multiple line
infections had blood cultures drawn from line on [**6-25**] growing
2/4 bottles Gram positive cocci. His blood cultures were drawn
as a result of back pain he had been having for 3 weeks as a
concern for possible epidural abscess. He states that 3 weeks
ago, he was taken by ambulance to OSH for low blood sugar and
felt he "wrenched his back." He states that the discomfort is
bilateral low back without radiation down the backs of his legs.
It is worse with lying flat and better sitting up in his
wheelchair. It has improved in the past week, although he was
recently prescribed tramadol. He is able to ambulate some with
prosthetics (b/l BKAs). He denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea. He has had some constipation but takes stool
softeners. He makes little urine. He denies bowel incontinence.
He denies headaches, changes in vision, numbness, weakness,
tingling. No chest pain, shortness of breath or cough. He
received vancomycin at HD prior to being sent to ED.
.
ED: rectal exam with normal rectal tone. His bp in ED was 80's
systolic but improved after 1 L NS. MRI ordered, but patient
declined at that time.

IR PROCEDURES: Femoral line HD:
RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9441**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 380**]. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 380**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
throughout the procedure.

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After informed consent was obtained from
the patient explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure,
the patient was placed supine on the angiographic table, and the
right groin was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
fashion. Using ultrasonographic guidance and local anesthesia
with 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the right
common femoral vein and a 0.018 guide wire was advanced through
the needle up to the distal part of the IVC under fluoroscopic
guidance. Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and
after venous access was obtained documenting vessel patency. The
needle was then exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.
The wire was exchanged for a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **] wire that was placed
with the tip in the IVC. The groin incision was progressively
dilated
with 12 and 14 French dilators. A double lumen 14.5 French
hemodialysis
catheter was placed over the wire, and the wire and the inner
dilator were
removed. The patient's final fluoroscopic image of the line
demonstrates the tip in the IVC. The patient tolerated the
procedure well, and there were no immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of temporary hemodialysis line
via the right common femoral vein. The line is ready for use.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for cerebral edema or stroke

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man admitted with fevers, now s/p PEA arrest and
unresponsive, although patient was responsive briefly after
arrest
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for cerebral edema or stroke
MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR ANGIOGRAPHY.

HISTORY: Admitted with fevers, status post pulmonary embolism
with arrest. Unresponsive. Assess for cerebral edema or stroke.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was
obtained.

COMPARISON STUDIES: None.

FINDINGS: There is mildly restricted diffusion within the
thalami bilaterally, as well as increased FLAIR signal in this
locale. A similar pattern of restricted diffusion and elevated
FLAIR signal is also seen in a ribbon-like distribution
involving both parietal lobe cortices. The symmetric
distribution of the findings is in [**Location (un) **] with the suspected
anoxic episodes sustained by the patient. There is no evidence
for abnormal blood products intracranially. There is no
hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. The
principal vascular flow patterns are identified.

There are extensive air-fluid levels distributed throughout the
paranasal sinuses as well as probable secretions within the
[**Last Name (un) **]- and oropharynx. These findings presumably represent the
effects of intubation.

There is low T1 signal within the odontoid process. The etiology
of this finding is uncertain. If there is concern for malignancy
elsewhere that could spread to bone, a correlative radionuclide
bone scan would be of assistance in comprehensively evaluating
the skeleton, when the patient's clinical state would permit
such an investigation to be conducted. It is possible, however,
that this finding may merely be a somewhat unusual expression of
degenerative disease.

CONCLUSION: Findings of concern for anoxic brain damage as noted
above.
