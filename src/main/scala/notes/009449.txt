Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a chronically ill 67m with dm2, chf, afib, AVR, cri, gib
(PUD s/p billroth, colonic ulcerations), splenic vein thrombosis
and gastric varices presents with 1 bloody BM at his rehab. He
was recently admitted for draining lue ulcer and is s/p removal
of hardware, on IV abx. He was at rehab in his usual state of
ill-health when he passed a maroon bowel movement, no associated
sx, on the day prior to admission. He has had no BM since, no
n/v since, though he does have frequent vomiting when he tries
to eat solid food; there's been no hematemesis. Has chronic
diarrhea, no recent changes. He denies lightheadedness, chest
pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or dyspnea on exertion,
though it should be said, he rarely exerts himself, spending
most time in bed, sitting, or in a wheelchair secondary to
extensive deconditioning during multiple hospitalizations. The
remainder of his ros is positive for a chronic cough with
sputum, with no recent change in either; he denies f/c, ha,
chest pain, palpitations, back pain, hemoptysis, abd pain,
hematuria. He says he's had a bloody bm once before and had a
colonoscopy showing "ulcers." However, his PMH is most
significant for bleeding PUD ending in a billroth II. In the ED,
his G-tube was aspirated, showing occasional blood clots in
straw colored fluid, not bilious. He got a unit of pRBCs for a
hct of 25, pantoprazole.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Respiratory distress:  Pt had an episode of respiratory
distress on [**4-19**] in the MICU with presumed LLL mucus plugging,
with good response to chest PT, nebs, and O2. Also with b/l
pleural effusions, as well as sputum growing GNR. He was started
on Ceftazidime [**4-19**]. After transfer out of the unit the patient
had an episode of tachypnea on [**4-22**] with increasing O2
requirements. CXR showed volume overload and he was diuresed
with IV lasix and symptoms improved. He had a known h/o
diastolic dysfunction and had received fluids in the MICU, which
could have contributed to this.   While he was in acute
respiratory distress the patient re-affrimed he was DNI, even
though he knew that he could potentially die.  His son was
called and was made aware of the situation.  He discussed this
with his father and they both re-affirmed he was DNR/DNI. Abx
were again started in the setting of respiratory distress and
fevers.  He had a thoracentesis on [**4-24**] with discovery of
transudative R pleural effusion. No evidence of PNA was found,
so ceftriaxone dc'd. He recieved PRN lasix.  Near the end of his
admission the patient was tachypneic for several days. ABGs
showed good oxygenation and his sats were stable. EKG showed no
changes.  This was thought to be [**1-19**] to respiratory compensation
from primary metabolic acidosis from uremia.  He also had a
component of volume overload but we were unable to diurese him
[**1-19**] to hypotension.  Cardiac enzyems were checked and were
elevated, suggesting he had an NSTEMI.  This was likely [**1-19**] to
hypotension vs. subdendocaridal ishcemia [**1-19**] to volume overload.
 Aggressive treatment was not pursued during the end of his
admission due to the family's wishes.  He remained significantly
volume overloaded,causing respiratory distress and was unable to
be diuresed [**1-19**] to hypotension.  After d/w the family it was
decided not to send the patient to the unit for pressors, or to
dialyze him for his ARF and he was made CMO.  He was seen by
palliative care and given morphine for [**Month/Day (2) **]. He expired on
[**2192-5-7**].

2)GI bleed: 62 yo male with DM, CHF, afib, AVR, CRI, PUD s/p
biliroth, gastric varices and splenic v. thrombosis s/p
splenectomy who presented s/p one episode of bloody BM at rehab.
On [**2192-4-16**] he had several large maroon bowel movements on the
floor. He remained hemodynamically stable with stable hct.
Attempted to lavage G tube but were unable to do so. What came
back out looked bilious. Pt was sent for tagged RBC which showed
only a faint blush in LUQ on 2 hour images (not enough to
intervene).  He received 2 units of pRBCs and was transferred to
the MICU.  Colonoscopy was done on [**4-18**] and showed diverticulosis
of the sigmoid colon and descending colon and erythema in the
descending colon. EGD was also done and was negative. He
remained hemodynamically stable with guiac + stool. He was
continued on a PPI. hct slowly trended down over his admission
and he was transfused another unit of PRBCs.
.
3) Acute Renal Failure: At his most recent admission Cr was
between 1-1.5 and was most recently 1 on [**4-5**]. At admission Cr
was 1.5 thought to be d/t hypovolemia from bleed, dehydration
from decreased POs or possibly AIN in the setting of
eosinophilia. Nafcillan stopped and patient switched to
vancomycin.  Urine eos were found to be negative initially. His
UOP dropped during his stay and cr trended up from 1.1 to 4.6.
Potentially [**1-19**] to contrast nephropathy from imaging studies.
Could also have had a component of AIN [**1-19**] to ceftaz, as he had
a few eos in his urine.  Renal ultrasound was normal. He had HD
cath placed by IR and dialysis was initiated. Dialysis was
stopped after discussion the the patient and his son and [**Name2 (N
