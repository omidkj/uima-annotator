Admission Date:  [**2178-2-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2178-2-11**]


Service:  CORONARY CARE UNIT

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
85-year-old female with a history of hypertension,
dyslipidemia, breast cancer, status post XRT, who presented
to [**Hospital3 1196**] on [**2178-2-2**] complaining of chest
pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.  Her initial EKG
in the setting of hypotension demonstrated deep ST
depressions in the precordial leads, V2-V4, and she was found
to be in complete heart block.  She was initially externally
placed and subsequently had a temporary pacing wire inserted.
When she was in route to the [**Hospital6 2018**] she was found to have pulseless VT for which she was
shocked in the ambulance and started on Amiodarone.

When she arrived, she was on dopamine and Levophed.  She was
taken emergently to the catheterization suite where she was
found to have elevated filling pressures with a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 30 and notably prominent V waves
indicative of mitral regurgitation.  An intra-aortic balloon
pump was inserted and left in place for the duration of her
procedure.

A left heart catheterization revealed a left dominant system
with a small and diffusely diseased RCA, a total occlusion of
the proximal left circumflex artery, and a 95% stenosis of
the proximal LAD.  She subsequently underwent PTCA and
stenting of the left circumflex followed by reperfusion,
ventricular tachycardia.  She was shocked to a sinus rhythm
and then underwent successful stenting of the LAD lesion.
Excellent angiographic results were obtained following both
interventions.

Her hemodynamic and rhythm status subsequently stabilized and
she was able to wean off Levophed prior to transfer to the
CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, as above.  She had a positive
stress test in [**2159**] consistent with inferior ischemia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Dyslipidemia.
4.  Chronic venous insufficiency.
5.  History of carotid artery bruits with a carotid
ultrasound in [**2172**] demonstrating a less than 40% stenosis of
the right carotid and less than 40% stenosis on the left.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.

MEDICATIONS AT-HOME AS OF [**2177-11-5**]:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Fosamax q. week.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  She has a sensitivity to hydrochlorothiazide but
there are no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Blood
pressure 110/53, heart rate 81, in sinus, 02 saturation 96%.
General:  She was alert and oriented, and following commands.
HEENT:  She had wide, fixed, dilated pupils bilaterally.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Chest:  Regular
rate and rhythm, S1, S2, with no audible murmur.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema.  Her groin sites were stable post
cath.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal.  Her vent settings on admission
to the Coronary Care Unit were assist control with tidal
volume 500 and respiratory rate of 12.  Her lines upon
admission to the Coronary Care Unit included a right IJ
Cordis, left femoral artery intra-aortic balloon pump and a
right femoral venous Swan line, all of which were competent.


LABORATORY DATA:  White count 17.7, hematocrit 40, platelets
304,000.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.2, chloride 111,
bicarbonate 19, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose 236.  PT
12.7, PTT 24.5, INR 1.0.  ABGs 7.19, 36, 71.

EKG post procedure revealed normal sinus rhythm at 91 beats
per minute with an indeterminate axis and a QTC of 476, QRS
duration 150, right bundle branch block with ST depressions
in V2 to V4 of 3 mm consistent with a posterior MI.

EKG preprocedure at 8:02 a.m. revealed sinus rhythm with AV
dissociation consistent with complete heart block,
ventricular rate of 41, right bundle branch block, and [**Street Address(2) 11741**] depression in V2 to V4.

Chest x-ray:  ET tube 1.8 cm from the carina with an OG tube
in the distal esophagus but no cardiopulmonary process.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The initial impression on admission was
that the patient was an 85-year-old female transferred from
an outside hospital with an acute posterior MI and
cardiogenic shock precipitating complete heart block in the
setting of an occluded dominant left circumflex artery.

She underwent successful emergent revascularization of both
the LAD and circumflex lesions.

The patient transferred to the CCU intubated on a balloon
pump requiring dopamine for hemodynamic support.  Over the
next several days, she demonstrated a remarkable improvement
in her hemodynamic status and was able to wean off the
dopamine quickly followed by intra-aortic balloon pump wean
and removal.  She extubated successfully.

A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated residual ejection
fraction of 30% with overall LV systolic function moderately
to severely depressed with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of
the inferior free wall, posterior wall, and lateral wall, as
well as moderate 2+ aortic regurgitation and mild 1+ mitral
regurgitation.

Her post revascularization course was also notable for an
Enterococcus urinary tract infection for which she was
treated with vancomycin.  She was also found to develop a
pneumonia for which she was started on Levaquin.

She was called out to the floor for titration of beta blocker
and ACE inhibitor which she tolerated well.  She did have
some persistent symptoms of congestive heart failure for
which she was started on a standing dose of diuretic and
required titration up of this.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  She will be transferred to [**Hospital3 1761**] for continued IV antibiotics and cardiac
rehabilitation.  She will need to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] in the next two to three weeks.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 9920**] office
will call to make arrangements for this.  She will also
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in approximately one month and his
office will again call to set this up.

pressure of less than 100 or heart rate less than 60.
2.  Reglan 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. at lunch and dinner.
