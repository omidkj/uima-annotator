Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18730**] is a 72-year-old woman with a history of COPD on 2L
home O2 (FEV1/FVC 51% on [**3-4**]), diastolic heart failure, HTN,
and afib on warfarin who presents to the ED with dyspnea and is
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory failure.

She was in her usual state of health until a few weeks ago when
she noted noted increasing dyspnea on exertion, with worsening
over the last few days.  During this period, she denied chest
pain, cough, and fevers.  She presented to her PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
scheduled appointment and was found to be satting 87% on 2L, 91%
on 3L.  An EKG was negative for acute changes.  She was referred
to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vs were: 97.2 80 132/76 18 86%4L O2.  Her
exam was notable for inspiratory wheezes bilaterally, and a CXR
demonstrated ?right lower lobe infiltrate; a chest CTA was
negative for PE and demonstrated ?atelectasis versus infiltrate
in the region.  She was given ceftriaxone and azithro (she
denied a pcn allergg) and started on IV solumedrol 125.  She
received 2g IV magnesium for Mg 1.3 and aspirin 325.  Her ABG
was 7.45/47/67.  She required 5.5L O2 to reach O2 sats in the
90s and desatted to the 80s with movement.  EKG demonstrated no
acute changes and BNP was near baseline at 393.  Because of
concern for increasing O2 requirement, admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was
requested.

On the floor, she is comfortable and requesting food and
medication to help her sleep.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia:  Patient was admitted with dyspnea and increasing
oxygen requirements.  At the time of admission to the ICU,
pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure and
exacerbation of COPD were all consideratinos.

Given the imaging available, treatment for community acquired
pneumonia was initiated.  In speaking with the patient, she did
not feel she was signficantly off from her baseline
symptomatically.  Her oxygen saturations would occasionally fall
to the high 80s on [**1-29**] liters and would drop to the low 80s with
exertion.  It is likely that the patient experiences similar
episodes at home that are undocumented.

On the day of discharge, the patient expressed an interest in
following up with a pulmonologist (she has not seen one before).
 This was not able to be coordinated before discharge.

2. Hyperglycemia: While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's blood sugars
were noted to be elevated, ranging from 200 to 400, especially
while on steroids.  These improved once steroids were stopped.
