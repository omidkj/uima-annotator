Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7299**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright Red Blood Per Rectum and Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Upper Endoscopy
-Mechanical Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old woman with morbid obesity, diastolic
CHF, and afib on coumadin who presents with hemoptysis x several
[**Known lastname **] and BRBPR x2 [**Known lastname **].  The patient describes a slip/fall
approximately 2 months ago after which she experienced worsening
abdominal and back pain.  Since that time, the patient reports
having little to no appetite.  Over the past week, she has been
unable to keep any food down and describes one episode of
vomiting after attempting to eat.  Also endorses worsening of
her abdominal pain recently, especially over the RLQ.  Pain is
described as sharp and non-radiating. Self-d/c'ed coumadin this
past friday after she noticed that she was excessively bleeding
following a small cut.  The patient reports N/V with eating as
above, but otherwise denies CP, palp, SOB, diarrhea, fever or
recent illness.
.
In the ED, the patient's intial vitals were BP 142/47 and HR 134
(afib/rvr).  She was triggered for tachycardia and GI bleed. NG
lavage performed with blood clots intially but cleared after
200ml. Stool is brownish-green in color and guaiac positive.
Initial labs revealed Hct 35 (baseline 40), lactate 3.3, INR
>19, PTT 150 which were verified with repeat labs. Got 1L NS
IVF, 10mg IV vitamin K, type & crossed x2 units, started on PPI
gtt, vancomycin and FFP. Admitted to MICU with vitals 100.8,
112, 116/73, 22-30, 100% 2L NC.

CXR ([**2165-8-4**]): Low lung volumes, cardiomegaly, questionable
consolidation R base, no clear pneumonia or volume overload.

EKG ([**2165-8-4**]):  Rate is 134, a fib with RVR

CT chest/abdomen ([**2165-8-5**]): Markedly degraded image quality due
to patient body habitus.  Within these limits, note is made of
bibasilar consolidation and moderate volume left perihepatic and
perisplenic free fluid.

RUQ US ([**2165-8-8**]): Severely limited ultrasound due to the
patient's body habitus.  No gross biliary dilatation or ascites
identified.

CTA Chest ([**2165-8-9**]): The technical quality of the exam is
severely limited and allows only for evaluation of the central
pulmonary arteries, and the current CT does not reveal any
evidence of central pulmonary embolism. The lobar, segmental and
subsegmental arteries could not be evaluated due to severe
artifacts and technically limited CT exam.  Moderate
cardiomegaly with enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of
pulmonary artery hypertension.

US of abdominal soft tissue ([**2165-8-9**]): Unremarkable ultrasound
examination of the superficial tissues in the right upper
quadrant.

US left upper extremity ([**2165-8-12**]): No left upper extremity deep
venous thrombosis.
.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is probably low normal (LVEF
50-55%) but views are suboptimal for assessment of this. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-11-5**],
the abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload may be new but images are suboptimal
for comparison.

TVUS ([**2165-8-14**]): Enlarged uterus with multiple calcified
fibroids, at least one of which is in a submucosal location.
Direct comparison of fibroid size from previous  ultrasound is
not possible due to limited visualization.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 y/o F with multiple
medical comorbidities presenting with hemoptysis and BRBPR in
the setting of elevated PT/PTT.
.
# Bleeding - Patient presented with an INR >19 and bleeding from
her mouth, rectum and vagina.  An upper endoscopy was preformed
by GI which showed diffuse continuous atrophy of the mucosa with
no bleeding noted in the stomach.  She subsequently had a CT
Torso with PO contrast which showed no acute intrabdominal
process but was limited by body habitus.  She was given 2 units
PRBCs on [**2165-8-4**] and was admitted to the MICU.  Her bleeding
slowed down as her INR was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K.
     After her Hct was stable and bleeding was controlled, she
was transferred to the floor.  She continued to have vaginal
bleeding despite a normal INR, although no further
