Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubation (intubated at outside hospital).

History of Present Illness:
39 year old female with history of type 2 diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, heavy smoking history, and benzodiazepine
and narcotic abuse in the past, who presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital this morning complaining of 3 days of dyspnea, nausea,
and vomiting.  The history has been obtained via chart review,
and discussion with the family, as the patient is intubated and
without records at [**Hospital1 18**].  Per the family, she was in her usual
state of health until about 3 days ago when she complained to a
relative that she wasn't sleeping at night.  She also was having
nausea and vomiting, brown emesis.  This is all we know about
recent symptoms.  Her 15 year old son let her relatives know
that something wasn't right this morning, and she was found
disoriented, with only one shoe on, appearing unwell, at which
point she was brought by her family to [**Hospital1 **].

At [**Hospital1 **], initial vitals were HR 98, 134/63, 95% on ? RA.
Given diffuse expiratory wheezes on examination she was given
solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1.  A CXR revealed a LLL pneumonia and
she was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  She had
persistent hypoxia, with desaturation to the high 80s and
initial ABG 7.21/61/74, prompting intubation.  Additionally,
cardiac enzymes were elevated with a CK of 1900, MB of 25 with a
normal MB index, and elevated troponin I to 0.43 (nl < 0.1).  An
EKG showed lateral TWI in I and aVL, without ST segement
changes.  Labs also notable for a leukocytosis at 24,000, with
83% PMNs and 2% bands.

On transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was febrile to 102.2.  CXR
confirmed a LLL pneumonia, at which point vancomycin was added
to her regimen. Initial ABG was 7.17/66/242. Cardiology was
consulted given the cardiac enzyme elevation at the outside
hospital, and given that she had no EKG changes, they
recommended holding off on heparin for now and trending the
enzymes.  Repeat set here pending, but troponin is < 0.01.  Labs
otherwise notable for a leukocytosis at 22,000, hyperkalemia of
5.3, and hyperglycemia of 260.  Lactate was normal (0.7).  Blood
and urine cultures were sent.


Past Medical History:
1) Type 2 diabetes
2) Hypercholesterolemia
3) Narcotic, benzodiazepine abuse
4) Heavy smoking history.  No history of asthma or COPD that the
family is aware of.


Social History:
She has a 15 year old son with whom she lives.  She is not
married.  Most of her family members live in the area.  She
smokes at least 2 PPD for the last 25 years.  As above, she has
abused benzodiazepines including clonazepam, as well as
oxycontin, depakote, and sertraline in the past, and has been
through detox.  Her family does not think she has abused in over
a year, as they could tell when she was using drugs in the past.
 Her family denies IVDU on her part.


Family History:
Her father had an MI at the age of 37.  Her mother does not have
heart trouble.


Physical Exam:
99.2, 158/62, 90, AC 500 x 16, FiO2 100%, Peep 5, Pip 31, Pplat
20.
GENERAL:  Overweight caucasian female intubated and sedated.
HEENT:  Mild ecchymosis just inferior to right orbit.  No
crepitus.  Bilateral peri-orbital edema.
NECK:  JVP 8-10 cm H20.
COR:  RR, normal rate, no murmurs, rubs, gallops.
LUNGS:  Coarse breath sounds with ventilation.
ABD:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, non-tender, non-distended.
EXTR:  1+ pitting edema of the lower extremities to mid-tibia
bilaterally.

.
Port CXR [**10-13**] - 1) NG tube tip coiled with its tip in the
proximal esophagus.
2) Endotracheal tube tip approximately 2 cm above the carina.
3) Large left basilar consolidation/effusion, suspicious for
pneumonia in the right clinical context.
4) Ill-defined right hilar opacity may relate to a component of
aspiration.
.
NCHCT [**10-13**] - There is no evidence of acute intra- or
extra-axial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved.  There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures. There is opacification of the nasopharynx in
this intubated patient, presumabl collapsed airway as well as
fluid content.
.
EEG [**10-16**] - Markedly abnormal EEG due to the slow and
disorganized
background along with bursts of generalized slowing, some of
which
included spike or sharp and slow wave rhythmic patterns. These
findings
indicate a widespread encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic
disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Nevertheless, the bursts of generalized slowing included spike
or sharp
and slow wave features and raise concern for the possibility of
seizures. The discharges were not so prolonged on this recording
as to
indicate ongoing seizures now, but this remains a concern for
other
times. If the patient's status changes or a concern for
non-convulsive
seizures persist, additional recordings would be of benefit.
.
CXR (PA and lat) [**10-17**] - The heart size is normal.  Mediastinum
has normal position, contour and width. There is no evidence of
hilar enlargement.  The lungs are clear.  A better technique
chest x-ray demonstrates absence of any mass in the right middle
lobe.  The pleural surfaces are smooth with no pleural effusion
.
MRI [**10-17**] FINDINGS:  The posterior fossa structures are normal.
The cerebral parenchyma has normal brain white matter
differentiation.  The ventricles and the extraaxial CSF spaces
are unremarkable.  However, in the cervicomedullary region,
there is subtle area of increased signal intensity on the FLAIR
images (series 6, image 2), which is incompletely evaluated, as
no sagittal FLAIRS are available.  No obvious contrast
enhancement is noted in this area on the sagittal post-contrast
images.


Brief Hospital Course:
39 year old female with history of type 2 diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, heavy smoking history, and benzodiazepine
and narcotic abuse in the past, presenting with dyspnea and
hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to left lower lobe
pneumonia.

1) Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to drug
overdose. Upon further questioning with the family, it was
revealed that pt had taken a large amount of methadone (unknown
dose) that were found in a Vicodin bottle. Pt intubated at [**Hospital **]
transferred to MICU here and self-extubated the next day without
any subsequent difficulty pr
