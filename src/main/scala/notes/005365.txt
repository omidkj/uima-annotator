Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath, transvenous pacer placement

History of Present Illness:
80 yoF with severe AS (valve area 0.6), CAD, ESRD on HD who was
intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**2116-2-2**] with CHF. The
patient responded to dialysis. The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] CT surgery [**2116-2-5**] for consideration of cardiac
catheterization and valve repair. She underwent cardiac cath on
[**2-6**] revealing severe AS and 3-v CAD; plan was for OR Monday [**2-17**]
for CABG/AVR. The day of transfer to the CCU, telemetry showed
complete heart block without ventricular escape rhythm for 45
seconds. She was symptomatically fatigued, dizzy and nauseated.
Code blue was called. The patient was trancutaneously paced and
electively intubated.
.
On arrival to the CSRU, a transvenous pacemaker was placed. EKG
after transfer showed sinus rhythm at 92, 1st degree AV block,
RBBB, ST depressions in V4-V6, unchanged from previous to this
episode. Echocardiogram was performed showing the pacemaker wire
terminated at or within the lateral free wall of the right
ventricle and not at the apex. The patient was weaned off the
ventilator and extubated soon after transfer.

at the RUSB radiating to the carotids. There were no rubs,
clicks or gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no

[**2-7**] Cath
COMMENTS:     1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant
system revealed multi vessel disease. The LMCA had a 20% distal
lesion.
The LAD had a 60% mid vessel lesion involving a D2 branch that
contained
a 80% ostial lesion. The LCX gave off a large OM1 with a 70%
lesion. the
RCA had a 70% proximal lesion and a 60% mid lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was not performed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
.
[**2-10**] Venous duplex
FINDINGS: On the right, the greater saphenous vein measured 0.42
cm proximally and 0.28 cm distally. The largest interval
diameter measured 0.35 cm and the smallest interval diameter
measured 0.30 cm.

The right lesser saphenous vein measured 0.2 cm in the mid
portion and 0.2 cm in the lower portion.

The left saphenous vein has been removed previously.

The left lesser saphenous vein measured 0.19 cm superiorly, 0.2
cm in its mid portion, and 0.16 cm inferiorly.

.
[**2-11**] Carotid U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. Less than 40% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid
artery.
2. No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis in the
left internal carotid artery, status post prior endarterectomy
.
[**2-13**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  There
is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. There is brief right
atrial diastolic invagination.

The pacemaker wire appears to terminate at or within the lateral
free wall of the right ventricle and not at the apex. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
notified by telephone of above findings.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2115-12-26**], a pacemaker wire is now seen in the right
ventricle. The pericardial effusion is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 80 yoF with severe AS (valve area 0.6), CAD, ESRD
on HD who was electively admitted for CABG/AVR on [**2116-2-5**] to CT
surgery. Patient coded on floor for episode of CHB and is now
status post trans-venous pacer.  On Transfer to CCU, she
required increasing amounts of 3 pressors and increasing FiO2
and
