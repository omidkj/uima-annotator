This is a discharge summary from admission on [**2131-3-26**] to
[**2131-4-11**].  The remainder of the hospital course will be
completed by the team assuming the patient's care.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever, cough, nausea and vomiting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year-old
male with a past medical history significant for diabetes
mellitus type 1, status post cadaveric renal transplant
([**2126**]) with chronic rejection and pancreatic transplant
([**2129**]) on chronic immunosuppressives, coronary artery
disease, and history of gastrointestinal bleed who presents
with complaint of general malaise, nausea, vomiting, sore
throat and cough productive of white sputum.  The patient was
reportedly and his usual state of health until five days
prior to admission when he developed general fatigue.  Three
days prior to admission, the patient reports increasing
malaise and productive cough.  The patient's symptoms
reportedly waxed and waned over several days, however, the
morning of admission, the patient woke with acute onset
nausea, vomiting, fever with chills, and decreased urine
output.  The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Department for further evaluation.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was found with a
temperature of 102.2, heart rate 118, blood pressure 207/88,
respiratory rate 19, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
Given the patient's complaint of decreased urine output a
Foley catheter was placed with 120 cc of clear urine drained.
An abdominal CT was obtained for complaint of abdominal pain
with nausea and vomiting without evidence of acute pathology.
While in the Emergency Department the patient's temperature
spiked to 104.3.  Intravenous fluids (less then 1 liter
normal saline), cooling blanket and ice packs were applied.
the patient's oxygen requirement subsequently increased with
decreased oxygen saturation on room air from 95 to 90%.  The
patient was placed on nasal cannula with increasing oxygen
requirements and eventually intubated secondary to impending
hypoxic respiratory failure.  An initial chest x-ray in the
Emergency Department demonstrated a right upper lobe and left
lower lobe opacity, however, on repeat chest x-ray post
intravenous fluids, the patient's pulmonary infiltrates
increased consistent with pulmonary edema.  The patient was
started on broad spectrum empiric antibiotics including
Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl for multilobar
pneumonia.  The patient also received Nitropaste and
Hydralazine 20 mg intravenous times one for hypertension with
systolic blood pressures greater then 200.  The patient was
placed on Versed post intubation for sedation.

1.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus complicated by end stage renal
disease requiring hemodialysis.
2.  History of cadaveric renal transplant [**2126**] complicated by

3.  Status post pancrease transplant in [**2129-10-10**].
4.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in [**2124**].
5.  Hypertension.
6.  History of large gastrointestinal bleed (source unknown),
felt to be secondary to CMV colitis.
7.  History of C-difficile colitis.
8.  Status post appendectomy.
9.  Status post retinal detachment in [**2124**].
10.  Status post cataract surgery in [**2125**].
11.  History of pancytopenia secondary to Imuran [**2130-11-10**].
12.  History of left arteriovenous graft thrombus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 103.4.  Blood
pressure 236/104.  Heart rate 130.  Respiratory rate 28.
Oxygen saturation 88% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  In general,
the patient is found agitated and rigoring in moderate to
severe distress.  HEENT examination normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact bilaterally.
Anicteric.  Dry mucous membranes.  Neck examination supple,
no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular examination regular rate
and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and 3 out of 6 systolic
murmur at the left upper sternal border.  Pulmonary
examination diffuse rhonchi throughout bilaterally with
egophony in the right lower lobe as well as left lower lobe.
No wheezing or rales noted.  Abdominal examination soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses
appreciated.  Guaiac negative.  Extremities warm and well
perfuse with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial
pulses and 1+ lower extremity edema to the mid shin
bilaterally.

LABORATORIES AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC with a white
blood cell count of 18.9 with a white blood cell differential
of 87% neutrophils, 6% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes and 2%
eosinophils.  H&H is 8.9 and hematocrit of 26.3 and platelets
of 132 (hematocrit on [**2131-1-30**] of 28.1).  Chem 7 with
a sodium of 146, potassium 4.2, chloride 116, bicarb 14, BUN
54, creatinine 4.8 (baseline 3.5 to 3.7) and glucose 121 with
an anion gap of 16, calcium 8.5, phosphorus 3.5, and
magnesium 1.3.  Liver function tests ALT of 38, AST 24,
alkaline phosphatase 180, amylase 66, total bilirubin 0.3.
Chest x-ray on admission demonstrated cardiomegaly with
bilateral interstitial edema consistent with congestive heart
failure, question possible pericardial effusion, right upper
lobe vague opacity likely representing pneumonia and right
sided subpulmonic effusion with a left lower lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram on admission sinus at 120 with left atrial
deviation, normal intervals, left ventricular hypertrophy,
with delayed R wave progression and T wave inversions in V4,
V6 and AVL.  Echocardiogram in [**2130-5-10**] demonstrating
ejection fraction of 60%, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  The patient presented with
complaint of shortness of breath and productive cough and was
found to have multilobar (right upper lobe and left lower
lobe) infiltrates on chest x-ray in the setting of fever.
While in the Emergency Department the patient's oxygen
requirements progressively increased and the patient was
intubated for impending hypoxic respiratory failure.  The
patient was maintained on the ventilator from [**3-26**]
through [**4-10**] with adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
The patient was initially started on assist control and
eventually changed to pressure support for weaning mode.  The
patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**3-27**] and later on [**4-4**] to better sample the secretions in the lungs for
microscopic data as well as visually evaluate the large
airways.  On [**3-31**] a chest CT was obtained with evidence
of a round cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe (upper
apices).  The patient was evaluated for CT guided biopsy,
however, this was deemed too risky given its location and
depth.  The etiology of the patient's cavitary lesion
remained unclear with negative sputum and bronchoscopy
results.  However, the patient had, per wife's report, a
prior gram negative rod right upper lobe pneumonia.  It was
felt that the right upper lobe cavitary lesion may be
secondary to pneumonia resolving with necrosis.  The patient
was noted with increased secretions requiring frequent
suctioning as well as intermittent agitation requiring
frequent sedation making ventilator weaning difficult.  With
improved mental status, off sedation the patient was
successfully extubated on [**4-10**] without complications.  The
patient is currently on face tent with adequate oxygenation
at the time of d
