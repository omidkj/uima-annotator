Chief Complaint:
 unresponsiveness and PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
77yo F w/hx of dementia, bipolar, anxiety, R hip fx [**2-27**] with
post-op PE and infected hematoma, s/p IVC filter, recurrent UTI
[**2-27**], advanced dementia who comes in from NH after being found
unresponsive. She was reportedly unresponsive for 5-10m and
hypoxic at 88%. Put on NRB and was 94% so was brought in.
Reportedly awoke to her baseline AAOx1 after 5m.
.
Of note: she had right ORIF [**2-27**] c/b postop PE (right lower
lobe) then hematoma. Anticoag stopped and IVC filter placed. She
also developed infection and pseudoanyeursm both treated.
.
In ED, 89% on RA then up to 96% on 2L. BP stable. HR 60-70. EKG
showed NSR, LAD, Q aVF, TWI III, TWF V3-V6 (no change). CTA
chest showed acute thrombus at bifurcation of right PA extending
into right middle lobe artery. No thrombus in left side. She was
started on heparin gtt without bolus. CE: CK flat but Trop 0.05.
Seen by vascular service who recommended bilat ultrasounds which
showed bilat lower ex DVTs. Hct at 36. Repeat HCT stable.
.
Currently, she feels well but difficult to assess related to
dementia. She denies pain anywhere. Denies CP or SOB. No leg
pain. Wants to be left alone to rest. ROS neg for fevers,
chills, or other systemic sx.
.

Imaging:
========
[**6-20**] LE Duplex
1. Partially occlusive thrombus in the right superficial femoral
vein extending to the right popliteal vein.
2. Partially occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein,
which does not extend distally.
3. Thrombosed pseudoaneurysm in the left groin.

[**2117-6-20**] UE Duplex: No evidence of upper extremity DVT,
bilaterally

[**2117-6-21**] ECHO:
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Sub-optimal image quality. Right ventricular size
and systolic function is probably normal. Left ventricular
function is hyperdynamic. Mild mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-3-12**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower on the
current study (however the TR jet velocity may be underestimated
on the current study).

[**2117-6-20**] CTA:
1. Acute pulmonary embolism in the right pulmonary artery at its
bifurcation, extending into the right middle lobe branches. More
chronic-appearing thrombus present in the right lower lobe
branches.
2. Compression deformity of T10 vertebral body, appears
unchanged, but not
completely visualized on the [**2117-3-11**] study.
3. No acute aortic abnormality. Stable atherosclerotic
calcification.

[**2117-6-20**] CT Head: No acute intracranial abnormalities.

[**2117-6-20**] CXR: Patient is quite kyphotic. There are low lung
volumes. There is plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base.
Lungs are otherwise grossly clear. Heart and mediastinum are
within normal limits. The bones are quite osteopenic.



Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo woman w hx of R hip ORIF [**2-27**] c/b post-op PE c/b hip
hematoma and hip infection. Patient had IVC filter placed and is
not on anticoagulation. Found unresponsive in NH and hypoxic
which improved now with only 2L. CTA shows large prox right pulm
artery PE. EKG without noticable strain. Mild trop leak.
.
# PE
No comment on RH strain seen on CT. Still given proximitiy,
likely this could be considered submassive. She is HD stable at
this point and has good resp status. Pt was anticoagulated with
IV heparin and also started on low dose coumadin (2.5-3mg/d).
Her INR today is 1.9. She was switched to lovenox on the day of
discharge and should overlap heparin with coumadin for at least
3 days more. Because this is recurrent PE despite IVC filter she
is a candidate for life-long anticoagulation. Goal INR should be
2 - 2.5
.
# Hx hematoma - H&H was monitored daily and was stable. There
was no clinical evidence of bleeding.
.
# dementia/psych:
Mental status improved over 24-48 hrs and returned to her
baseline. continue psych meds.
.
# ID:
Pt remained on the fluoroquinolone for her prior hip infection.
She developed low grade fever (<100.5) on [**6-24**] and ha d a chest
x-ray (negative except for improving atelectasis) and UA
(negative). No evidence of infection identified, and she
defervesced spontaneously, so likely secondary to atelectasis.
.
.
# Hypertension:
Initially Metoprolol was held given history of bleed and PE.
This was restarted [**6-22**] after heparin was therapeutic for >24
hours and she had no bleeding.

# FEN/GI - tolerating regular diet, puree solids, thin liquids
