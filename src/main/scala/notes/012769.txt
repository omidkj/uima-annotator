Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Palpitations and chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of tunneled HD catheter ([**2162-9-21**])
Placement of temporary internal jugular central venous line *2
Placement of tunneled IJ central venous line
Left sided thoracentesis
IR guided PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
85 year old female status post coronary artery bypass grafts x 3
and mitral valve annuloplasty on [**2162-8-16**], chronic systolic CHF
(EF 30%), HTN, and CKD presents with chest pain and
palpitations. The patient was discharged to rehab from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**8-24**] after CABG for 3V CAD. On the day prior to admission she
experienced a fluttering sensation in her chest and "heaviness"
in her legs while walking around. She has had lower extremity
swelling bilaterally, but did not have chest pain until the
morning of admission.  On the day of admission she awoke with
sub-sternal chest pain radiating to the left arm and back,
associated with palpitations but not with SOB. The pain was not
positional. She noted a stable cough with clear sputum
attributed to a new medication started post-op. She also noted
some difficulty with swallowing since leaving the hospital. She
has not had fever, chills, URI symptoms, dizziness,
light-headedness, diaphoresis, orthopnea, or PND. She did not
experience chest pain when she had her prior MI. She was taken
from rehab to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] by ambulance and subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.

<b><u>RADIOLOGIC STUDIES</b></u>
Chest Radiograph from Admission ([**2162-8-26**])
IMPRESSION: Persistent left pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis. Superimposed consolidative process in the left
lower lobe cannot be ruled out. Smaller right pleural effusion.
Overall, unchanged from [**2162-8-24**].

Chest Radiograph from [**2162-9-7**] (day of PICC placement and
thoracentesis)
IMPRESSION:
1. Right PICC ends in superior vena cava.
2. Stable appearance of the chest, including degree of
mediastinal widening, pulmonary vascular congestion, left
greater than right pleural effusions and cardiomegaly as well as
dense retrocardiac opacity.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and apical
akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. A mitral
valve annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring
appears well seated and is not obstructing flow. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
