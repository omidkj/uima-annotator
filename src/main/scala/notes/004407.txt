Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, hematuria


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVL placement with subsequent removal

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] is a 85 yo male recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to
an extended care facility after being treated for hypoxia,
hyponatremia, and acute renal failure. He was found to have an
aspiration pneumonia and was given a two week course of
Levo/Flagyl during his last admission. In addition, the pt was
persistently hypoxic with room air oxgyen saturation 90-91%, and
was discharged on one liter oxygen via NC. Per the rehab notes,
the pt had an episode of worsening hypoxia and hematuria and was
brought to the ED. While in the ED, the pt became transiently
hypotensive with a BP of 70's systolic (initially 100/60). The
pt received blood and fluids, and BP improved to 90's. A SC CVL
was placed, and urine/ blood cultures were sent.
.
In the ICU, the patient remained normotensive following blood
transfusions plus IVF. In fact, the ICU team believed that some
of his hypoxia could be due to fluid overload, so he did receive
some diuresis. He was started on Vanc/Zosyn/levo on admission,
but he levofloxacin was discontinued on [**9-22**] as his urine
legionella was negative. He had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test in the ICU
which was < 9 at 2 hours, so he was started on steroids. These
were subsequently discontinued as the patient had no evidence of
sepsis and was able to maintain his blood pressure following
fluid resuscitation. In addition, the patient's hematocrit has
remained stable after two units of PRBCs. He was seen by his
usual hematologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who feels as though his
hematuria is chronic and would likely not require further
intervention unless the patient's anemia was severe. In
addition, the patient was evaluated by urology who have
recommended continued Foley use.

Pertinent Results:
Labs notable for elevated proBNP, elevated AP, elevated
creatinine to 1.5 (1.0 at discharge) and decreased hct to 28.4
from mid 30's.
.
[**2157-9-20**] CXR: Increased left retrocardiac opacity in comparison
to prior exam, which may represent an area of volume loss or
consolidation.
.
[**2157-8-31**] LUNG SCAN:
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show demonstrate
subsegmental defects in the right upper lung and defects in the
bases
Chest x-ray shows patch infiltatrates and yesterday's CXR
reveals pleural effusions. The above findings are consistent
with a low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION:  Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.

.
[**2157-9-2**] RUQ US: No evidence of cholelithiasis.
.
[**2157-9-1**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF 70%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in
the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis.  Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
[**2157-9-7**] video swallow: no evidence of aspiration
.
Renal US ([**9-22**]): No evidence of hydronephrosis or stones. Likely
hematoma/clot seen within bladder.
.
CXR ([**9-20**]): Increased left retrocardiac opacity in comparison
to prior exam, which may represent an area of volume loss or
consolidation.
.
CXR ([**9-21**]): Tip of the new right subclavian line projects over
the upper right atrium. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has
worsened exaggerated by slightly lower lung volumes due to
persistent bibasilar atelectasis. Heart size top normal. Small
left pleural effusion increased. No pneumothorax. Tracheal
deviation is probably a function of upper thoracic scoliosis and
tortuous head and neck
vessels.
.
CXR ([**9-26**]): There is a thoracic scoliosis convex to the right.
There is cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular engorgement and
bilateral pleural effusions consistent with CHF. In addition,
there are bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, with
obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to a
combination of left pleural effusion and atelectasis or
consolidation in the left lower lobe. The findings are similar
to those noted on the prior study of [**2157-9-21**] but with
probable increased patchy opacity at the right lung base. The
previously noted right subclavian CV line has been removed.
.
Lower extremity ultrasound ([**9-27**]): No evidence of DVT
bilaterally.
.
Chest CT ([**9-29**]): 1. There are bilateral moderate-sized pleural
effusions with adjacent atelectasis. In conjunction with
ground-glass opacity and areas of intralobular septal
thickening, these findings are consistent with CHF. 2. There are
diffuse osseous sclerotic metastases, as identified on recent
bone scan from [**2157-9-2**].
.
CXR ([**9-29**]): There is no significant change in the appearance of
the normal heart and bilateral pleural effusions as well as the
left lower lobe consolidation which is most likely _____
atelectasis but there is improvement of the bilateral pulmonary
edema.
.
Renal ultrasound ([**9-30**]): 1. No evidence of hydronephrosis. 2.
Layering echogenic material in urinary bladder that most likely
represents presence of hemorrhage.
.
Labs prior to discharge notable for platelets 46,000, WBC 12.3,
creatinine 3.3, BUN 64, INR 1.6, albumin 2.8
.
Microbiology: C. diff negative X 2
Sputum culture pending but multiple organisms on gram stain from
[**10-1**]
MRSA in urine from [**9-20**] but not present on repeat urine culture
[**9-28**]


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] is an 85 yo male with history of metastatic
prostate cancer, bladder varices, and chronic bladder
obstruction who presents as a transfer from the MICU for
hypotension, now resolved, and hematuria, thought to be chronic.
At this time, he and his family would like to pursue palliative
care measures.
