CXR [**8-22**]:
========
FINDINGS: There has been no significant change in the
tracheostomy tube or the left subclavian line with tip
projecting over the SVC. The heart size appears mildly enlarged.
There continues to be opacity at the left lateral lung base
which may represent atelectasis, consolidation or effusion.
There is patchy area of increased opacity in the right lower
medial lung as well. This is slightly increased compared to the
prior day. Otherwise, there is no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 y/o F w/ trach, found to have bloody secretions, fever and
proteus bacteremia.
.
# Proteus Bacteremia- Blood cultures from [**8-21**] grew 2 out of 2
bottles positive for proteus, with intermediate sensitivity to
quinolones. Levofloxacin had been initially started prior to
return of sensitivities. This was changed to IV meropenem to
complete 14 day course (Allergies to pcn, cephalosporins,
sulfa). Suspected source is her urine, given her floridly
positive urinalysis on admission. However initial urine culture
was contaminated, so there is no positive urine cultures to
support this. Sputum cultures were also taken, but also returned
contaminated. She has had no evidence of shock, remaining
hemodynamically stable, with good urine output, mentation, and
baseline renal function. Midline placed for completion of IV
antibiotics at rehab.
.
# Pneumonia- Left lung opacity on initial CXR. Clinically with
increased secretions from trach, diffuse ronchi on lung exam.
Initially covered with Vancomycin and Levofloxacin, subsequently
changed to Meropenem on [**8-23**]. Sputum cultures contaminated.
Repeat sputum cultures taken [**8-23**]. She remained stable from an
oxygenation standpoint throughout her hospital course,
maintained on trach mask at 30% FiO2 with intermittent
suctioning for secretions.
.
# Bloody secretions- Small volume blood from trach site, likely
secondary to bronchitis vs tracheal irritation/inflamed
granulation tissue. Less likely endobronchial lesion. Bleeding
in setting of anti-coagulation w/ INR 2.4 on admission. Coumadin
held and given Vitamin K in ER. No further bleeding from trach
over next 48 hours and hematocrit remained stable. Initial plan
was for bronchoscopy to evaluate bleeding source, however
patient refused procedure. This was also discussed with her son.
Since she remained stable, with no further bleeding, and refused
procedure, bronchoscopy was deferred and she was discharged back
to her care facility on coumadin.
.
# CHF- She was continued on her b-blocker and lasix.
.
# Afib- Rate controlled with b-blocker; Anti-coagulated w/
coumadin. Initially on hold given her tracheal bleeding.
Re-started prior to discharge given h/o recent CVA.
.
# DMII- Controlled on sliding scale insulin. Diabetic diet.
.
# Psych- Continued on klonpin, seroquel
.
# Chronic pain- Continued on methadone, gabapentin
.
# psoriasis- on chronic prednisone 10mg/day
.
# precautions- mrsa precautions, VRE
.
# FEN: ground textures for all meals; low fat-diabetic; cuff
must be up when she takes fooby mouth.
.
Full Code- per rehab records
.
# Communication- regular care at [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**]; currently at
[**Hospital 745**] Health Center. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 65059**]; [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]

The pt was discharged to [**Hospital 745**] Health Center in stable
condition to complete 14 day course of IV Meropenum for Proteus
bacteremia, PNA, and UTI.
