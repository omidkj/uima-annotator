Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, weight loss, mechanical fall

Head CT

History of Present Illness:
72 yo F with a distant history of throat cancer as well as
hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presents after a
mechanical fall found to have widely metastatic disease of
unknown primary.
.
On the morning prior to admission, the patient awoke to go to
the bathroom. She felt week and slumped/intentionally laid on
the ground. She was unable to get up from the floor due to
generalized weakness. She was on the ground for a total of
approximately 15hours. She denies head trauma or loss of
consciousness. The patient's family had the police break the
door to her apartment at which point she was found on the floor,
alert. She was brought to [**Hospital6 **] where she was
found to have multiple lab abnormalities including renal
failure, Ca >13, CK elevation, WBC 19 with bandemia, LFT
abnormalities and coagulopathy. She had a right subclavian
central line placed. CT abdomen at the OSH revealed a large lung
mass 5cm in RLL as well as liver mets.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED 99.8 92 153/90 18 97% 4L NC. The patient
received morphine IV, vancomycin 1g and metronidazole 500mg IV.
She underwent a torso CT confirming the OSH findings. Head CT
also revealed a possible intracranial met vs. bleed. The patient
was evaluated by neurosurgery in the ED for her intracranial
findings and they recommended dilantin load. Prior to arrive to
the ICU she is 6L in, 1L out.

.
CT chest abdomen pelvis:
1. No free air, or acute intrabdominal process.
2. Right lower lobe mass with extensive hepatic metastases,
possibly from
patient's known throat CA. Correlation with old records at
outside hospital
is recommended.
3. Contrast within the esophagus could reflect esophageal
dysmotility or
reflux.
4. Bulky left adrenal without discrete lesions in non-contrast
setting.
Comparison with prior studies is recommended.
.
TBNA: Consistent with metastatic non-small cell carcinoma.
.
MRI brain: 1. 1.1 cm enhancing lesion in the left cerebral
hemisphere, in close proximity to the central sulcus, possibly,
post-central in location, the accurate assessment of location,
is somewhat limited due to motion artifacts. This most likely
represents a metastatic lesion given the history of metastatic
lung cancer. However, other etiologies, like primary mass cannot
be definitively excluded. Comparison with any prior studies
would be helpful. Pt. also needs neurosurgical consultation and
close follow up study if no intervention is contemplated.

2. Small enhancing lesion in the left occipital bone, seen only
on MPRAGE
sequences, may represent focal area of enhancement in the bone
marrow or a
lesion. Correlation with bone scan would be helpful.

3. Patent major intracranial arteries, within the limitations of
significant motion artifacts. Atherosclerotic disease noted
involving the cavernous carotid arteries, without flow limiting
stenosis.

.
CT head: 1. 12 x 10 mm focus of high attenuation at the
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction of the posterior left frontal lobe.
Given the history of metastatic cancer, this is highly
concerning for a metastatic lesion. Further evaluation with MR
[**Name13 (STitle) 46499**] MRI is recommended.
2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F w/history of throat cancer now admitted after falling at
home, with associated rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. On CT
scan, patient was found to have diffusely metastatic disease to
the liver and brain, with a RLL lung mass. Her lung mass was
biopsied by interventional pulmonary with pathology consistent
with NSCLC. Her skeletal survey did not show evidence of bony
lesions. Her CA27.29 and CA125 were elevated, and she had a
transaminitis thought to be secondary to liver metastases. She
was evaluated by oncology and neurooncology during her stay.
Oncology felt that due to her poor performance status, she would
not be a candidate currently for treatment until her performance
status improved. A palliative care consult was placed, and
patient was started on sublingual morphine and lorazepam for
comfort and pain. She also had some nausea and abdominal
discomfort, with no evidence of perforation on KUB, and a
negative urinalysis. She was given an aggressive bowel regimen.
She will benefit from radiation therapy to her brain as well, to
be performed as an outpatient if she chooses to proceed.
Otherwise, she will continue with a transition to comfort based
care.

She was also noted to have an oxygen requirement, thought to be
secondary to tumor burden in her lungs as well as likely
underlying COPD. She was maintained on her inhalers, and will
leave the hospital on oxygen as needed. She was also given IV
diuretics as needed, with minimal improvement in her
oxygenation.

Initially, patient had a CT scan and MRI of the brain which
showed a likely intracranial metastasis. She was initially
started on dilantin and was evaluated by neurosurgery and
neurooncology, and was felt not to need antiepileptics. The
dilantin was subsequently discontinued.

For the patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, his
initial CK and LDH were elevated, with blood on UA, without
RBCs.  She was given aggressive IVF hydration with improvement
in her creatinine.

Patient was initially noted to have hypercalcemia, and was given
IVF. Her skeletal survey was negative.

She was also noted to have positive blood cultures on initial
set draw on [**6-23**], which eventually grew out coagulase negative
staph aureus. She was started on vancomycin, which was
discontinued once final cultures returned. Her repeat blood
cultures are negative to date.

She will need to follow up with oncology for further evaluation
once her functional status has improved after a rehabilitation
stay.
