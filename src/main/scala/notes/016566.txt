History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 42yo F w/ h/o ESRD on HD and CHF who was referred
from hemodialysis for H/H drop from 9.0/28.9 to 7.2/24.4 today.
She is clinically asymptomatic, denying lightheadedness,
dizziness, or increased fatigue, but is tachycardic.
Pt was in her USOH until this past Tuesday ([**10-22**]) evening when
she reports voluminous grossly bright red diarrhea and
associated dizziness, lightheadedness and fatigue. She
attributed the bright red stool to a red-colored antibiotic pill
that she had taken 2 hours prior. Her diarrhea resolved by
Wednesday morning although she continued to feel fatigued
throughout the day. This morning she awoke feeling relatively
well and received scheduled HD where routine lab tests revealed
h/h drop.
She denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, or
sick contacts. Of note, she has had 2 recent hospitalizations
this month: the first for bacteremia ([**Date range (1) 32442**])treated w/ a 2

for HCAP ([**Date range (1) 17940**]) treated with zosyn switched to levofloxacin
(course ending [**10-26**]). During this last admission she was also
started on 2 week course of fluconazole to cover any possible
[**Female First Name (un) **] infection from HD catheter site.
Following the most recent hospitalization she had cough, phlegm
and shortness of breath which have since resolved. Pt reports
severe chronic generalized skin itchiness and excoriations from
her ESRD. She c/o chronic neuropathic/phantom limb pain (h/o
bilateral lower extrmity amputations). She denies any cough,
SOB, chest pain or palpitations.
She is very distraught at having to be in the hospital again.
In the ED, initial VS were:  97.7 110 144/83 19 100% 2L. 2,
18-gauge PIVs placed. Rectal exam negative for hemorrhoids or
rectal abnormalities, pt had BM of brown stool that was guiac
positive. She was bolused with 1L NS and transfused with 2 units
pRBCs. She was also given IV diphenhydramine for itching.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. BP 166/85, HR 107, RR 16

Imaging:
[**2025-10-23**] CXR:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing right
upper lobe parenchymal opacity has almost completely resolved.
However, there is a newly appeared left-sided pleural effusion
of moderate extent.  The effusion is not associated with a
substantial elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  However,
atelectasis at the left lung base has developed.

Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  The course
of the
dialysis catheter is constant.

[**2115-10-26**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Small left pleural effusion with coursing along the parietal
pleura.
Secondary empyema cannot be excluded by imaging.
2.  Multiple areas of bronchiectasis, particularly in the right
upper and left lower lobes, suggesting chronic infection.
3.  Trachea changes consistent with tracheomalacia.
4.  Coronary artery disease


Brief Hospital Course:
42F w/ ESRD on PD and CHF referred from hemodialysis for
asymptomatic H/H drop.
.
#Anemia/GI bleed: Acute anemia (drop of 9.0/28.9 to 7.2/24.4)
most likely secondary to lower GI bleed given guaiac positive
stools and history of bright red diarrhea 2 days prior to
admission, however no evidence of active bleeding. Pt does not
have h/o hemorrhoids/fissues (not noted on ED rectal exam),
diverticuli or AVM. Haptoglobin wnl, retic count decreased but
this is expected in the setting of her renal disease; MCV
normalized. GI decided not to scope emergently as pt is
hemodynamically stable and Hgb/Hct was no longer dropping after
blood transfusions x2. Patient is on protonix [**Hospital1 **]. No symptoms
of GI bleed prior to transfer to the medicine floor. Patient was
transferred to the floor on [**2115-10-26**]. We spoke with GI who
recommended trying to do a colonoscopy and endoscopy prior to
discharge. It was agree
