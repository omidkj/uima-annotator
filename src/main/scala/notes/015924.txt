Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC Placed [**2186-1-20**] by IR, replaced [**2186-1-25**]
Percutaneous Cholecystostomy [**2186-1-20**]

History of Present Illness:
80yo female with multiple medical problems including COPD, CAD
s/p stent, stage 1 breast cancer s/p mastectomy, and colon
cancer s/p colectomy was admitted with dyspnea.

She is being followed in infectious disease clinic for pulmonary
aspergillus infection and Mycobacterium abscessus. Upon
presentation to [**Hospital **] clinic, she was noted to have persistent
productive cough with sputum production and decreased energy.
Exam in [**Hospital **] clinic was notable for BP 80/45. She was then
referred to the ED for further evaluation.

Upon arrival in the ED, temp 98.3, HR 82, BP 92/42, RR 19, and
pulse ox 92%. Labs revealed Cr 2, alk phos 216, and Hct 31.1.
RUQ US was notable for gallstone at the neck of the gallbladder
and CT Abd/Pelvis revealed RLL aspiration, distended
gallbladder, ectactic infrarenal aorta, and diverticulosis. CXR
revealed likely RLL pneumonia. Surgery was consulted for
evaluation of the cholelithiasis and imaging findings. Given
that she is not having abdominal pain, they thought she did not
have any clinical signs of cholecystitis. If she did develop
clinical signs of cholecystitis, they recommended HIDA scan and
consideration of percutaneous cholecystostomy tube. She was
started on broad-spectrum coverage for hospital-acquired
pneumonia with linezolid, zosyn, and clindamycin.

[**2185-11-1**] Bronchial Washings - aspergillus, mycobacterial abscess

STUDIES:
[**2186-1-16**] RUQ US - prelim report - markedly distended gallbladder,
impacted gallstone in neck, no gallbladder wall thickening, no
pericholecystic fluid, common duct is not dilated, pancreas not
well-visualized, no son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign

[**2186-1-16**] CT Abd/Pelvis - prelim report - Trace RLL aspiration.
Distended GB- correlate clinically or with US. Ectatic
infrarenal Ao- 2.4 cm.
Colonic tics, constipation. Old L post rib fx, DJD.

[**2186-1-16**] CXR - prelim report - stable RUL lobectomy, lungs are
clear, trace right pleural effusion, left axillary clips

[**2186-1-17**] HIDA: The findings are consistent with acute
cholecystitis, however the accuracy of the test is diminished as
the patient has been NPO for several days.

[**2186-1-17**] CT Chest w/o contrast:
1. Interval increase of bilateral pleural effusions, with an
atelectatic
right lung. Multifocal consolidation opacities in the right
lung, likely
combination of bronchovascular crowding, atelectasis and/or
multifocal
pneumonia. Mucous plugs in the right-sided bronchi, compatible
and concerning for Aspergillus pneumonia.
2. Unchanged right bronchostenosis, incompletely assessed in the
current
study.

[**2186-1-18**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
decrease in the volume of the post-surgical right lung. A small
right pleural effusion has newly occurred. There is a small
retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise, the left lung is
unremarkable. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged
position of the left axillary and right paramediastinal clips.

[**2186-1-20**] HIDA (repeat): Non diagnostic (incomplete) gallbladder
scan due to patient refusal to allow completion of exam. The
gallbladder did not fill over 36 minutes, but the lack of full
imaging does not allow confident diagnosis of acute
cholecystitis.

[**2186-1-20**] R LENI: No DVT

[**2186-1-21**] ECHO (TTE): Very suboptimal image quality.The left
atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %) - apex
appears to contract better than the base. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
