Chief Complaint:
Fever/Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE

History of Present Illness:
34 y/o M with a PMH of ESRD secondary to membranous
glomerulonephritis on HD via AV fistula, MSSA Aortic Valve
endocarditis (from line infection) necessitating AV replacement
([**2161-9-18**]) with post-op course complicated by aortic root
abscess/dehiscence requiring re-do AVR/homograft ([**2161-9-29**]). He
was treated initially with a course of nafcillin, subsequently
on suppressive dicloxacillin through 11/[**2162**]. He was readmitted
[**8-25**] with MSSA bacteremia and presumed prosthetic valve
endocarditis. He was treated initially with Naf/gent but dropped
counts on Nafcillin so was transitioned to Cefazolin. He was
treated with rifampin for six week course. He was transitioned
to cephalexin 500 mg orally twice daily as suppressive therapy
[**10-25**]. He reports intermittent chest pain with associated
numbess of his limbs and nausea. His baseline blood pressure has
been 80-90 systolic.
.
On [**2165-2-1**] he underwent a fistulogram and balloon angioplasty of
his AVF for suspected stenosis. He reports the development of
fever to 103 with nausea and diarrhea last week which resolved
without intervention. He reports having blood cultures drawn in
HD which were negative per pt.
.
He came to the ED today [**2-19**] to fever and CP that started
yesterday, with temp to 103. CP improved with improved temps. He
again today had CP, fever, and dyspnea and in the ER. VS were:
T100.2 BP 90/31 HR 102. ECG demonstrated STE in superior leads
and ST depression in lateral leads. He received vancomycin 1 gm
IV.
.
The patient was evaluated on the medical floor and reported
resolution of chest pain. Denied shortness of breath. He was
taken to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 for scheduled HD. During HD session the patient
developed chest pain with ECG demonstrating worsened ST
depressions anteriolaterally and small STE in V1-V2. His blood
pressure decreased to 60s systolic during his symtoms. He was
given morphine 0.5mg IV X1 with subsequent improvement in his
symptoms and ECG. BP improved to 90s systolic. He did not have
fluid removed during HD. Cardiology was consulted and MICU
evaluation obatined. He was tranfered to the MICU for concern of
endocarditis.

Past Medical History:
# ESRD on HD M/W/F, [**2-19**] FSGS on renal bx in [**2158**]
- L AVF stenosis s/p percutaneous angioplasty [**2164-10-21**] and
[**2165-2-1**]
- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on transplant list
# Aortic valve endocarditis with MSSA s/p bioprosthetic AVR
[**2161-9-18**]
- presumed secondary to HD line infection
- c/b peri-valvular abscess that recurred after his initial
AVR requiring homograft valve and aortic root replacement with
reimplantation of his coronary arteries ([**2161-9-29**])
- Completed 6 week course of nafcillin on [**2161-11-12**]
- then dicloxacillin through [**11-24**].
- recurrent MSSA bacteremia with presumed recurrent endocarditis

in [**8-25**] treated with 6 weeks of rifampin and cefazolin with 2
wks
of gent
- On cefalexin 500 [**Hospital1 **] since for suppressive therapy
# CHF, H/O systolic and diastolic dysfunction, EF >55% 8/08
# PFO, with left to right shunt on TTE [**2161-9-29**]
# Bilateral subclavian vein, left IJ and left brachiocephalic
thromboses s/p brachiocephalic vein stent.
# Hypertension
# Hyperlipidemia
# Chronic fatigue syndrome
# Pyloric stenosis in childhood, surgically repaired
# [**2-/2165**] admission for fever/chest pain, Enterococcus
bacteremia. Treated with Ampicillin and Streptomycin
