bruits. No varicosities.
NEURO: Nonfocal

Pertinent Results:
[**2104-11-17**] Carotid duplex ultrasound
No evidence of stenosis in either carotid artery.

[**2104-11-18**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The interatrial septum
is aneurysmal. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. A large secundum atrial septal defect is
present.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]
3. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
posterior mitral leaflet prolapse and flail of the P1 and P2
segments. There is anterior (A1) leaftlet prolapse. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mitral regurgitation is
noted. The effective regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2 Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

[**2104-11-20**] CXR
In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there has been removal of
the left chest tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and mediastinal drains.
Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax. Some residual
atelectatic changes are seen at the left base. There is interval
blunting of the costophrenic angle on the left, consistent with
some pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted the day prior to surgery several days after
stopping her coumadin. She was taken to the operating room on
[**11-18**] where she underwent a mitral valve replacement, an atrial
septal defect closure, a MAZE procedure and ligation of her left
atrial appendage. Postoperatively she was transferred to the ICU
in critical but stable condition. She was extubated later that
same day. On postoperative day one, she was transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. Her chest tubes and wires
were removed without incident. She was started on heparin as a
bridge to coumadin for anticoagulation for her mechanical valve.
She was transfused 2 units of pack red blood cells for a hct of
21. She was gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with her
postoperative strength and mobility.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 23054**] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged to home with VNA services on postoperative day #7.
Her coumadin dosing will be managed by Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a
target INR of 3.0-3.5.First blood draw is tomorrow, with
subsequent draws Mon-Wed-Fri until stabilized. She will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], her cardiologist and her primary
care physician as an outpatient.
