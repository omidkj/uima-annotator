Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from OSH after
being ruled in for a myocardial infarction. He underwent a
cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel coronary
artery disease. He underwent usual pre-operative work-up along
with carotid u/s, echocardiogram, and pulmonary function tests.
Renal was consulted secondary to his h/o renal insufficiency and
possible contrast nephropathy. Over the next several days he
underwent above test and renal continued to evaluate and surgery
was delayed pending creatinine to decrease. He was brought to
the operating room on [**2134-4-12**] where he underwent a off-pump
coronary artery bypass graft x 2. Please see operative report
for surgical details. Surgery was uneventful and he was
transferred in stable condition to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. He remained intubated for several days and unable to
wean off sedation secondary to patient becoming restless and
agitated. He also remained on multiple pressors and was started
on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation on post-op day three. His
WBC was elevated and Vancomycin was continued and he was started
on ceftriaxone. Multiple cultures were taken (urine, sputum,
blood, stool) throughout post-op course. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. On post-op
day three he underwent a head CT to evaluate for a stroke which
showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or shift of
normally midline structures. Neurology and psychology were
consulted. Felt agitation was related to delerium. On post-op
day five he had another head CT secondary to continued agitation
when weaned from sedation and failure to respond to
stimuli/followe commands. CT again revealed no CVA. He was
eventually weaned off all pressors and was started on beta
blockers and diuretics. On post-op day six a Dobbhoff feeding
tube was placed. It was found on post-op day eight the feeding
tube was in mid-esophagus and eventually [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 28075**]-[**Doctor First Name 1557**]
feeding tube was placed via fluoro. Finally on this day sedation
was weaned, he made more purposeful movements and was extubated.
Following extubation though he had more agitation events and
wasn't following commnds. Over the next several days he remained
stable, still was agitated at times but was more alert and
oriented. He did require a patient observer throughout post-op
course. Post-op day nine he had a speech and swallow study. He
started to tolerate liquids by mouth and his diet was slowly
advanced. On post-op day fourteen he appeared to be improving
and was finally transferred to the cardaic surgery step down
floor. But on post-op day fifteen he was transferred back to the
CSRU following patient found to be disoriented, lethargic w/
flat affect. He also developed aphasia and right side
hemiparesis. Head CT was performed which again revealed no CVA.
Blood culture taken on this day revealed staphylococcus coag
negative bacteria. His mental status appeared to be improving on
post-op day fifteen. He underwent another head CT on post-op day
seventeen which revealed a new hypodensity in left temporal
lobe, representing acute left MCA infarction with small amount
of hemorrhage, with mass effect. Carotid u/s was performed which
revealed 40-59% stenosis in both [**Country **] and [**Doctor First Name 3098**]. He also had an
EEG done which suggests deep midline subcortical dysfunction
consistent with a mild encephalopathy and superimposed fast
activity which is suggestive of a medication effect. He remained
stable though, slowly improving and was eventually transferred
back to the cardaic surgery step down floor on post-op day
nineteen. On post-op day twenty-one a PICC line was placed for
long-term total parenteral nutrition. Physical therapy followed
patient during post-op course for strength and mobility. On
post-op day twenty-two Mr. [**Known lastname **] aphasia was still present but
slightly improving. Hecontinued to improve and was discharged to
rehab facility on post-op day 25.
