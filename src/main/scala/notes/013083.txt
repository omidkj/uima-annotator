Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M with hx of afib, hypertension, ?dCHF, recent aspiration
pneumonia, being treated with levofloxacin and flagyl,
presenting from home with increasing SOB since midnight,
increased secretions, decreased mental status overnight.
Patient has 24-hr caregivers at home who called EMS.  Unclear if
patient has been having fevers at home.  Patient currently on
levo/flagyl course for aspiration pneumonia.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.1  HR 125  BP 163/94  95% on ?L
O2. Patient was given a dose of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
metronidazole due to likely aspiration.  EKG showed AFib rate
131 with no ischemic changes. CXR showed increase in pleural
effusions and atelectasis bibasilar. Lactate not elevated at
2.0.  Trop elevated at 0.13, increased past his baseline.  He
was given a dose of aspirin 300mg rectally.  BNP elevated to
4200.  Patient was trialed with BiPap, which he did not tolerate
well due to altered mental status.  Patient was initially not
given any IVFs but BPs started to drop to 80/44, for which he
was given 500cc bolus IVFs, to which BP reponded. Patient is
DNR/DNI and is being transfered to medical ICU for further
management.  ED staff had conversation with HCP in [**State 2748**]
who understood that patient was not doing well.  Vitals in ED
prior to transfer are as follows: 99/60  HR 90-126 (afib)  RR 32
 100% on NRB.
.
In the ICU, patient appears comfortable on non-rebreather.  He
is able to squeeze hands to commands and answer some yes or no
questions.  He denies pain.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2145-4-23**] 7:00 AM
1. Mild interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions and
associated basal atelectasis.
2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
.
EKG [**4-23**]-Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
There is a regularity which may represent atrial flutter. Low
amplitude QRS voltage in the limb leads. Indeterminate QRS axis.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2145-2-4**] the venetricular response is now rapid. QRS
voltage in the precordial and limb leads is much lower. Clinical
correlation is suggested.
.
LENI [**4-23**]-
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right lower extremity.
.
[**4-24**] UENI-IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right upper
extremity
.
CXR PICC-Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison
to [**2145-4-23**].
Left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Bilateral pleural
effusions
are large. Interstitial pulmonary edema is unchanged. No
definitive
pneumothorax is noted on the current study. Mediastinal contours
are stable.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
TTE ([**2145-4-27**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild septal hypokinesis.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**5-1**] CXR-SEMI-UPRIGHT BEDSIDE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The right
costophrenic angle
was beyond the field of view. Note is made of bilateral pleural
effusions,
which appear unchanged. These effusions as well as overlying
basal
subsegmental atelectasis result in partial obscuration of the
cardiac
silhouette which nevertheless appears minimally changed.
Mediastinal and
hilar contours are also unchanged, with note again being made of

atherosclerotic calcification along the aorta. A left PICC again
is seen to terminate at the upper portion of the superior vena
cava.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
