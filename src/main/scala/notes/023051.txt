Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous liver biopsy
Colonoscopy
EGD

History of Present Illness:
50yo M w/ a PMH of EtOH abuse and psychiatric disorder p/w
fatigue, anorexia, and abdominal mass. Pt states that he has had
worsening fatigue over last 1-2 weeks, accompanied with early
satiety, decreased appetite and weakness. However, over last
several days, has noted increased abdominal girth and tenderness
in his RUQ, particularly when trying to lay on his stomach. He
has been spending 18-20 hrs/day in bed due to fatigue and noted
a hard mass in his RUQ. He describes 2 different types of
abdominal pain - constant, gnawing pain in his RUQ and then
crampy, throbbing, intermittent pain that he imagines is his
colon/constipation. Denies fevers, chills, night sweats, weight
loss, CP, SOB, palpitations, nausea, vomiting. + Dysphagia to
solids (for years). + constipation, no BM in 8 days. Denies
dysuria or frequency. Denies melena, dark or tarry stools, or
BRBPR. Denies swelling, rash, itching in his skin. Denies LH,
dizziness, vision changes or URI sx. Has chronic nonproductive
cough from smoking. Went to his PCP's office today and was sent
to the ED for immediate evaluation.
.
In the ED, VS were T 99.1, BP 172/98, HR 99, RR 16, sats 96% on
RA. He had labs drawn which showed a transaminitis, elevated alk
phos and elevated bilirubin. He also has a mildly elevated
lipase. He underwent a CT a/p which revealed massive
hepatomegaly, c/w severe acute hepatitis, and stranding around
the pancreatic head c/w pancreatitis. He also had dilated bowel
loops by my read, along with LAD seen by radiology. KUB was
negative for obstruction. He was admitted to medicine for
further workup of his abdominal mass.

Pertinent Results:
.
Liver biopsy:
Metastatic small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in fibrotic
stroma (trichrome stain examined); see note. Note:  On
immunohistochemical staining, the cancer is focally positive for
chromogranin, negative for S-100 protein and synaptophysin, and
shows dot-like cytoplasmic staining with the AE1-AE3/Cam 5.2
cytokeratin cocktail, is strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 and
negative for cytokeratin 20.  The CK7/CK20 staining pattern
strongly favors the lung as the primary site for the cancer.
The iron stain is non-contributory.
.
[**2182-4-9**] CT a/p: Findings c/w severe hepatitis, including ascites,
although no CT evidence of cirrhosis; stranding about pancreatic
head suggestive of pancreatitis; no biliary obstruction;
periportal lymphadenopathy, non-specific but often seen with
infectious hepatitis
.
[**2182-4-9**] KUB: No evidence of small bowel obstruction or free air.
Moderate amount of stool throughout the colon.
.
CT head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, no change from
[**2180-6-2**].
.
CT chest:
1.  Large spiculated left upper lobe lung mass which
radiologically most
likely representing primary lung tumor with extensive
mediastinal involvement.
2.  Increased pericardial effusion.
3.  New right lower lobe atelectasis.
4.  Known liver enlargement and involvement by tumor.
5.  Bilateral adrenal enlargement which may be either due to
bilateral
hyperplasia or a metastatic involvement.
6.  Moderate emphysema.
7.  Old rib fractures
.
Bone scan: pending

Brief Hospital Course:
50M w/ a PMH of EtOH abuse and psychiatric disorder p/w fatigue,
anorexia, found to have metastatic lunch cancer to liver,
pancreas and abdomen.
.
# METASTATIC SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER: The patient initially
presented with hepatomegaly and was found to have innumerous
nodules as well as a pancreatic head mass. Hepatology was
consulted and a percutaneous liver biopsy was performed which
was consistent with a neuroendocrine small cell lung primary.
Oncology was consulted. Chest CT confirmed the presence of a
spiculated lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Bone scan
was performed and is pending. Tumor markers CEA and CA [**93**]-9 were
elevated, but AFP normal; 5-HIAA and chromogrannin are pending.
He underwent EGD and colonoscopy which was unrevealing. Due to
the metastatic disease, his liver functions slowly worsened and
he developed signs of hepatic encephalopathy; the patient was
given lactulose titrated to 4 bowel movements per day with
improvement in his symptoms. Hepatitis panel negative for A/B/C
viruses. MELD 13, [**Last Name (un) 26460**] score/discriminant function is 16.
Given the new diagnosis and worsening of his liver function, the
Oncology team  hoped to initiate chemotherapy as an inpatient.
.
On the morning of [**2182-4-19**], the patient developed worsening
mental status changes,  tachypnea and increasing abdominal
distansion and tenderness.  CXR was unrevealing, however, ABG
revealed a lactated of 8.  He was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics  for suspicion of SBP, or other abdominal source of
infection; he was  transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Upon arrival to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his respiratory status further deteriorated and he was
intubated.  He was continued on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and flagyl
for evolving sepsis.  On the morning of [**2182-4-20**], the patient
further deteriorated, and required 3 pressors to maintain his
blood pressure.
.
A family meeting was held at approximately 10:00 AM [**2182-4-20**]; at
that meeting his parents requested that the goals of care be
changed to comfort measures only, given his underlying
metastatic disease and overall poor prognosis.   Supportive care
was withdrawn.  The patient passed away quietly at 1410pm.  An
autopsy was requested by his mother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
