Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zosyn / ceftriaxone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness, altered, intubated for airway protection found
to have urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated, mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
65 yo female with MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 84078**] for questionable hx TMJ who was
sent in from her NSH after being found covered in vomit with
agonal breathing.  NSH notes reports "symptoms of seizure
activity" with patient subsequently unresponsive and found to be
hypoxic with sats <83% on 2L.  Per EMS, she was unresponsive en
route, still breathing but not withdrawing to pain.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: no temp recorded, 118 135/71 34
100% on NRB.  She was easily intubated for airway protection
with a grade 1 view.  Head CT was unremarkable for bleed.  Neuro
was consulted and felt this was likely toxic metabolic if
seizure activity, but will continue to follow.  She has had
multiple episodes of UTI in the past.  Blood and urine cultures
were sent and she was given vanco/zosyn.  Foley was changed.
Per the ED resident, they were not aware of her potential
allergy but she did not have a rash prior to transfer to the
MICU.  When the patient was signed out she was currently doing
well on vent with most recent vitals prior to transfer being
afeb, 92, 103/60 with sats 100% on 400x18, 5x50%.  She dropped
her pressures prior to transfer to 67/41 with HR 94.  She was
given 2L of IVF and started on levophed.  Sedation was held.
.
Of note, per Dr.[**Name (NI) 84079**] note to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] last admission was
for urinary tract infection, E. coli bacteremia, and sepsis, and
initially required admission to the ICU for vasopressor support.
She was also found to have an obstructing left renal stone and
had a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed with improvement in
her infection. She was able to be taken of vasopressor agents
and was discharged to complete a 14 day total course of
antibiotics.  At that time, urology recommended to leave the
nephrostomy tube in the left renal system indefinitely with tube
changes every 3 months as she was high risk for both
nephrolithotomy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.  Her
hospital course was also notable for hypoxia with a 4L oxygen
requirement which was felt to be due to a combination of mild
volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness in the setting of
multiple sclerosis and infection, and intermittent aspiration.
Her oxygen requirement was stable and she was discharged to
rehab to have gentle diuresis as tolerated and tocontinue her
usual dysphagia diet.  She has been on 2L at her NSH with
unclear continued workup.

TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum
and apical anterior and inferior walls. The remaining segments
contract well (LVEF 40%). The apex is not aneurysm and no apical
thrombus is seen. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD
distribution). Pulmonary artery hypertension.

CTAbd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Foley catheter is now positioned with its distal tip seen in
the right
ureter. Repositioning is recommended. These findings were
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by telephone at 12:10 a.m. on
[**2118-12-12**].

2. Left nephrostomy tube with small left subcapsular hematoma
and unchanged left ureteropelvic junction stone.

3. No evidence of small-bowel obstruction despite large amount
of stool seen within the rectum and sigmoid.

4. Unchanged right renal staghorn calculus.

Renal US:
IMPRESSION:

1. Right renal stones without hydronephrosis.

2. Unchanged mild left collecting system fullness.
