dinner in the dark, tripped on the back stairs, and had
mechanical fall. No dizziness, palpitations, chest

LOC. He immediately got up by himself from the ground, thought
he was fine and got in his friend's car to be driven home,
noticed that he couldn't bend his head down well, friend drove
him to OSH for assessment.

At OSH, CT head was negative, CT C spine showed C1 fracture. One
hour after his fall, he vomited x1, no blood, had no abdominal
pain at the time. Has chronic constipation, cannot remember last
BM. Was transferred here for ortho spine fracture consultation.
When he arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] ED, ortho assessed patient, placed him
in hard collar, admitted to ortho for observation, but he was
hypertensive to 220s, HR 60-70s, and he was placed to MICU

difficulty controlling his SBP in 190s.

CT C-spine:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fractures across the right anterior arch of C1 and central
right posterior arch of C1, with 5 mm of distraction of the
right anterior arch fragments, as well as mild atlanto-occipital
offset on the right.

CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2.  Incompletely visualized fracture of the C1 vertebral body,
please refer to the cervical spine CT for full details.

XR L femur:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of fracture.

CXR:
IMPRESSION: 2 areas of increased opacification bilaterally with
prominence of the left hilum. Comparison with previous films is
essential. If these are not available, CT should be obtained.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 M with CABG, HTN, DM2, s/p mechanical fall, here with C1
fracture and hypertensive urgency.

# C1 fractures:
CT C-spine showed fractures across the right anterior arch of C1
and central right posterior arch of C1, with 5 mm of distraction
of the right anterior arch fragments, as well as mild
atlanto-occipital offset on the right. Ortho recommended wearing
hard C collar for three months with no surgery, and followup in
one week after discharge with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**]. His phone number
is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3573**].  Please call his office to schedule an
appointment.

# Hypertensive urgency:
Patient was found to have SBP 220s in ED, had not taken his home
antihypertensive regimen. In the ED, he was placed on nitro gtt
with SBP 140s, and patient was transferred to the MICU. Nitro
gtt was titrated off and patient was transitioned to home
regimen of ramipril and Toprol with SBP 120-130s.  His blood
pressures remained elevated and he was started on norvasc 5mg.
The norvasc was just increased to 10mg daily today (only got 5mg
this [**Last Name (un) 44550**] prior to leaving for rehab).  Please titrate up his
metoprolol as needed for futher blood pressure control.

# Mechanical fall:
CT head was negative for fracture or hemorrhage. CT C spine
showed C1 fractures. XR L femur was negative for fracture.
Possible etiology of fall includes strict mechanical fall in the
evening dark, infection, cardiogenic syncope, retinopathy
etiology. EKG shows TWI V1-V4, 0.5-1mm STE III, 1mm STD I and L,
RBBB, with no previous EKG for comparison and cardiac enzymes
were cycled. Patient was maintained on ASA, metoprolol, and
statin. Patient states recent ophthalmology appointment for
diabetic retinopathy was normal, but it was recommended that
patient follow up regularly in case vision was contributing
factor to fall.

# Cardiac:
Patient has history of CABG years ago. EKG showed anterolateral
ischemic changes, RBBB, previous EKG was not available for
comparison and was rechecked. Patient was maintained on ASA,
metoprolol, statin. TTE was not available in [**Hospital1 18**] records.
Cardiac rhythm was NSR 60-70s. Patient was asymptomatic
throughout admission with no chest pain/pressure, no shortness
of breath.

# Diabetes mellitus, presumed type 2:
He reports DM2 diagnosed 40 years ago. He was maintained on ISS.
His home regimen is lantus 40 units QAM, Novolog 12-20 units per
meal.  If his sugars are elevated at rehab, his insulin sliding
scale should be increased.

# Hyperkalemia/chronic sinusitis:
Patient reported that he takes potassium iodide tablets for
chronic sinusitis daily. He was advised to stop taking potassium
iodide as an outpatient and was told that his potassium was
elevated likely due to this medication.

# Chest Opacifications
Chest X ray on [**2147-8-21**] noted two opacifications in the left
upper lobe. Patient should have a follow-up chest CT performed
as an outpatient.
