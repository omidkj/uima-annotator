History of Present Illness:
67 year old male with PMH significant for HTN, hyperlipidemia,
NIDDM, CRI (baseline 1.7-1.9), admitted to the MICU with concern
for sepsis. He reports a history of several weeks of diarrhea
([**4-25**] BM/day), nausea, and vomiting, with associated decreased
food and fluid intake. He denies fevers, chills, abdominal pain,
hematemesis, hematochezia, melena, or BRBPR. He denies any
recent travel, sick contacts or antibiotic use.  He denies any
fever, chills, chest pain or shortness of breath.

Of note, he was recently discharged on [**2153-10-18**] following
admission for diarrhea, nausea/vomitting. All studies at that
time were negative, with no findings on stool culture, KUB, or
CT scan to explain symptoms. He was discharged with plans for an
outpatient colonoscopy.

In ED - patient was hypotensive 86/47, afebrile. He received 4
Liters IV NS but had persistent hypotension as well as increased
lactate to 3.6 and a Cr of 4.0, up from baseline of 1.7-1.9, and
he was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

[**10-22**] EKG: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch
block. QTc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to
measure. Low QRS voltage. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of [**2153-10-13**] there may be no
significant change, but baseline artifact makes comparison
difficult

Radiology:
[**10-22**] CXR: Lung volumes are reduced. Cardiac, mediastinal, and
hilar contours are normal allowing for technique. The lungs are
clear. There is no free air under the diaphragm

[**10-22**] KUB: No gross evidence of toxic megacolon. Difficult to
exclude early or partial small bowel obstruction

[**10-24**] MRA Abdomen: Linear signal abnormality extending for 1.5 cm
in the celiac artery likely representing a small, focal
dissection of unknown acuity. The distal celiac and its branches
are patent. No MRI evidence of bowel ischemia. The SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
are widely patent. Mild signal changes in the mesentery may
represent mesenteric panniculitis as seen in the recent CT from
[**2153-10-13**]. Other entities cannot be completely excluded
and followup with noncontrast CT in three-six months is
recommended to assure stability. Non-distended terminal ileum
without inflammation of the mesentery around it; thickening of
the terminal ileum cannot be excluded on the basis of this study

[**10-26**] MR enterography: Normal-appearing terminal ileum. The bowel
and colon appear unremarkable on this examination

[**10-29**] colonoscopy: Polyp in the proximal descending colon
(polypectomy c/w adenoma). Normal mucosa in the whole colon
(tandom right colon biopsy normal). Diverticulosis of the
sigmoid colon

[**10-29**] upper endoscopy: Polyps in the small hypertrophic polyps
from PPI RX
Normal in the whole duodenum (biopsy normal). Otherwise normal
EGD to second part of the duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old man with h/o HTN, CRI admitted with persistent
nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and acute on chronic renal
failure. Initially in MICU given hypotension (resolved with
hydration), transferred to general floor [**10-24**].

1) Chronic diarrhea: Infectious etiologies were thoroughly
investigated. Between this and his recent prior admit, the
patient had C. diff (-) X 4, O&P (-) X 7, Yersinieae (-),
Campylobacter (-), E. coli 0157 (-), crypto/giardia DFA (-).
Strongyloides antibody was pending at time of discharge. Further
work-up included a 5HIAA, which was normal, and an EGD and
colonoscopy which showed no clear source of diarrhea (proximal
descending adenoma, see results section) with negative random
duodenal/right colon biopsies (no evidence of microscopic
colitis). MRI enterogram was without evidence of inflammation of
the ileum, and MRA of the abdomen showed only a small celiac
dissection (see below). The patient's diarrhea gradually
improved without intervention, and, at the time of discharge,
was only having [**11-20**] bowel movements a day. Further work-up,
including evaluation for celiac sprue, may be considered as an
outpatient. Of note, MRI of his abdomen showed mild signal
changes in the mesentery (see results section) which may
represent mesenteric panniculitis as seen in the recent CT from
[**2153-10-13**]. Other entities cannot be completely excluded
and followup with noncontrast CT in three-six months is
recommended to assure stability.

2) Anemia - iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency: The
patient's hematocrit gradually trended down to a nadir 21.5 (26
at discharge). As mentioned above, EGD and colonoscopy did not
show source of bleeding, although iron studies were consistent
with iron deficiency. He declined blood transfusion and was
started on iron supplementation. Given low vitamin B12 level,
the patient received 1 week of daily IM vitamin B12 injections;
he should have one IM injection weekly for 1 month, followed by
monthly injections as an outpatient. Further work-up for occult
sources of GI bleeding, such as pill endoscopy, should be
considered as an outpatient at the discretion of his
PCP/gastroenterologist.

3) Acute on chronic renal failure: With hydration, the patient's
creatinine gradually trended down from 4 on admission,
indicating likely pre-renal etiology in the setting of
diarrhea/poor PO intake. At time of discharge, his creatinine
was 1.8. This should continue to be closely monitored as an
outpatient to ensure stability.

4) h/o DVT: The patient was restarted on Coumadin after his
colonoscopy/upper endoscopy and was transitioned with a heparin
drip until he was therapeutic at 2.3 on discharge. His INR will
need to continued to be monitored as an outpatient, with the
dose adjusted as needed for a goal INR [**12-22**].

5) Eosinophilia (new since [**9-24**]): Given diarrhea, there was
concern for a parasitic infection, however multiple O&Ps were
negative (see above). The patient had a normal a.m. cortisol
level, not consistent with adrenal insufficiency. Urine
eosinophils were normal and Strongyloides antibody was pending
at time of discharge. Further work-up should be pursued as an
outpatient; if this persists, than bone marrow biopsy may be
considered, particularly given the patient's history of
polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].

6) Type II diabetes: The patient's Lantus dose was gradually
titrated
