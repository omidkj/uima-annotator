Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress/rash

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF

History of Present Illness:
Intern Transfer Note
.
CC:[**CC Contact Info 66254**].
The patient is a 71 year old female with a history of COPD FEV1%
61, rheumatoid arthritis and SLE on prednisone, methotrexate and
etanarcept(recently held 1.5 months ago) who presented to
[**Hospital3 7571**]status post a spontaneous fracture of the left
femur s/p ORIF on [**3-24**] and distal pinning on [**2146-3-31**] at [**Location (un) **].
The patient has a documented history of an allergy to augmentin
resulting inpresyncope, nausea and vomiting in the past, but was
treated post-op with cefazolin x 3 doses. On [**3-27**], she
developed a macular rash on her back and shoulders which then
spread to her palms and soles with some desquamation of the skin
on her back and spread diffusely throughout her body, as well as
swelling of her hands and feet. She was evaluated by dermatology
at [**Location (un) **] who felt her skin findings were may have been
consistent with a drug reaction as the patient has sensitivity
to Augmentin and was placed on cefazolin which has
cross-reactivity with pencillins. She underwent a second ortho
procedure on [**2146-3-31**], the patient received one dose of vancomycin
as a result. However, dermatology was also suspicious of other
causes given that her rash appeared to be in multiple stages at
that time and vesicular in nature and a Tzanck smear was
obtained.

Pertienet to her OSH course, the patient also reports that she
received 3 units of blood during her ORIF.  On [**2146-3-29**], the
patient spiked a temperature to 103.4 with a WBC of 14.7 . At
the time of her temperature spike, the patient had a UA that was
positive for LE with 10-20 WBCs although not a clean sample with
[**3-6**] epithelial cells. She was treated for a presumed UTI with
urine cultures and blood cultures pending.
.
On [**2146-4-3**], the patient developed acute-onset shortness of breath
with mid-sternal [**4-8**] chest pressure that resolved on its own
that the patient states she believes was due to anxiety and
productive cough of greenish sputum. A VQ scan was obtained
given the patient's recent insufficiency at 1.4-1.6 which was
low prob for a PE in the setting of a D-dimer post-operatively
of 4200. A cardiology consult was considered but not formerly
placed prior to transfer. CXR showed LLL atelectasis. ABG prior
to transfer was 7.45/35/241 on 100% NRB.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-3**]. On arrival, the patient was
felt to be in mild respiratory distress and placed on a high
flow mask 35% FiO2 and did not require intubation. Ortho was
consulted on [**4-4**]-6 given the patient's increased LLE pain in the
setting of her recent surgery.  They plan to take her back to
the OR once her respiratory status and other medical issue
resolve.
.
On [**4-6**] she was transferred to to the floor on the [**Hospital Ward Name **]
where she developed acute SOB again. CXR was did not reveal CHF
or PNA and a CTA was performed to r/o PE. It was negative for PE
but did reveal b/l pleural effusions with atelectasis and
emphysema and questionable small area of devloping PNA, and an
Echo with Ef>55%, normal RV size and motionShe as strted on
levo/flagyl and continued on nebs with significant improvemnt in
her O2 sats to 95 % on 6 L FM.
.
On arrival to the floor she denied CP, SOB, N/V, abdmonimal
pain, calf pain. She says that her skin continues to itch, but
is felling much better.

Pertinent Results:
[**4-4**] Femur Xray: There is complex comminuted fracture of the
proximal femur, with lateral apex angulation of the proximal
fragment, with somewhat unusual alignment. The patient is status
post fixation with intramedullary rods and screws. There is
subcutaneous air abutting the distal femur.

IMPRESSION: Status post fixation of comminuted fracture of the
proximal femur with proximal lateral apex angulation with
somewhat unusual alignment. Subcutaneous air adjacent to the
distal femur.
.

[**4-6**] CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: No evidence of
pulmonary embolism. There is a left-sided central venous line.
Aorta and great vessels appear intact. The esophagus is mildly
dilated and fluid filled. Airways appear patent. No
pneumothorax. There are bilateral small pleural effusions with
associated compressive atelectasis. There are severe
emphysematous changes of the lungs. There is an ill-defined
right lower lobe opacity.
There is biapical scarring and a left apical bleb. There are
multiple right- sided rib fractures. No pneumothorax is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Severe emphysema.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
4. Multiple right-sided rib fractures that were also present on
[**2146-4-4**]. No pneumothorax identified.
5. Mildly dilated, fluid-filled esophagus.
***6. There is ill-defined opacity in the right lower lobe,
possibly representing an early pneumonia. This was conveyed to
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66258**] at 10:20am on [**2146-4-7**].
.
[**4-7**] TTE Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a
loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

3/17 L femur: Five fluoroscopic images are obtained
intraoperatively without a radiologist present. These images
demonstrate revision of the previously seen intra- medullary
rod. Please refer to the surgical report for additional details.
