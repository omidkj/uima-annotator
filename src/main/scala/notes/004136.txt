Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1491**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for evaluation of upper GI bleeding and
possible esophageal rupture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
esophagogastroduodenoscopy; endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
51yoW with history of EtOH cirrhosis, transferred from [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital with UGIB and concern for esophageal perforation.
Patient initially presented to OSH [**2168-6-18**] with hematemesis, Hct
23, pltl 26, and SBP 70. There she was intubated for airway
protection and rescucitated with blood products (1unit
cryoprecipitate, 4units FFP, 3units pltl, vitamin K, and 8units
PRBC). A right IJ and right femoral cordis were placed. EGD
showed [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear and the endoscopist was concerned for
possible esophageal perforation. She was treated with iv
Protonix, octreotide gtt, intubated and placed on Levophed, and
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Thoracic Surgery service for
management of esophageal perforation. At [**Hospital1 18**] patient underwent
chest CT with contrast per NGT which showed no esophageal
perforation, but did show small bilateral pulmonary effusions.
Lab studies concerning for elevated transaminases (ALT 104, AST
259), Tbili 5.9, creatinine 1.4, WBC 12 12.7, and INR 1.5. She
was continued on the octreotide gtt, placed on vancomycin and
Zosyn. She is being transferred now to the MICU service for
further management. On transfer T 98.9 HR 63 BP 112/62 RR 16
100% on AC 450 x 16 PEEP 10.0 FiO2 40% with last ABG
7.42/32/114.
.
She was admitted to the MICU once esophageal perforation was
ruled out and treated with proton pump inhibitors and, once she
could be weaned from the ventilator, transfered to the
hepatorenal service until her alcoholic hepatitis stabilized.

Radiology studies:
[**6-25**] RUQ U/s:There is mild gallbladder wall thickening; however,
this could be related to the patient's cirrhosis and ascites.
The gallbladder is not distended, and there is no evidence of
stone.  The liver is small and coarsened in echotexture
consistent with cirrhosis.  No definite focal lesions are
identified.  No biliary ductal dilatation is identified.  There
is a large amount of ascites.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Cirrhotic liver with associated large amount of ascites.
2.  No biliary ductal dilatation identified.
.
[**6-24**] LENI:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
..
[**6-24**] CXR:  AP chest compared to [**6-20**]-27:
NG tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Right PIC
catheter ends in the lower third of the SVC.  Mild enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions have decreased since [**6-23**], obscuring the lower
lungs, and probable mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis.
Upper lungs clear.  No pneumothorax.
..
CT Chest:  no esophageal perforation; bilateral small effusions,
cirrhotic liver


Brief Hospital Course:
51yoW with h/o EtOH cirrhosis c/b varices and prior UGIB,
admitted with UGIB, alcoholic hepatitis, RLL pneumonia
originally to thoracic surgery service, then MICU on [**6-20**] now
transferred to the floor on [**6-26**] evening.
.
#  UGIB:  Etiology of bleed felt likely [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear
although pt has h/o varices as well. Patient has no evidence of
variceal bleed or ulcer on EGD at OSH.  There was a question of
esophageal tear at OSH but this was not seen on CT here.  Pt.
came from OSH on octreotide which was stopped after no further
bleeding for 48 hours. Pt is continued on PPI IV bid given h/o
bleeding. Hematocrit stable and there has been no further
evidence of bleeding. EGD was repeated at [**Hospital1 18**] to evaluate
varices before discharge and revealed 4 cords of grade II
varices without stigmata of bleeding as well as esophagitis and
evidence of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear. She will need to continue
taking protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] as well as nadolol, currently at 20mg
daily but recommend to increase to 40mg daily if BP will
tolerate, and will be seen in one week for EGD with possible
banding of varices once the [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear has had some time
to heal.
.
#  Resp:  Patient was intubated for airway protection at OSH.
Chest CT showed RLL consolidation with air bronchograms and
small bilateral pleural effusions, concerning for PNA vs
aspiration PNA. Patient was started on vanco/levo/flagyl for
likely asp PNA and concern for MRSA on [**6-20**]. Patient was weaned
off vent and extubated without complications on [**6-21**]. She was
weaned slowly off face tent and currently o2 sats in the high
90's on RA. Sputum cx from [**6-21**] neg. for organisms, however with
likely asp event, we treated empirically with 7-day course of
antibiotics. Speech and swallow eval [**6-27**] found no aspiration
risks after mental status improved.
.
She does have some component of COPD/asthma, which was
maintained on her home albuterol inhaler prn.
.
#  Hepatitis:  transaminitis with AST>ALT consistent with
alcoholic hepatitis. LFTs trended down over course of MICU stay
and now resolving. Patient counselled that alcohol abuse was the
direct cause of this illness and hospitalization and that
continued alcohol use will lead to worsening of the disease. She
verbalized understanding, but per social work investigation, she
has participated in multiple alcohol abuse programs near her
home without successful cessation of alcohol use.

# Cirrhosis:  patient with elevated bilirubin and INR c/w liver
failure.   Once patient was extubated and NGT placed, lactulose
and rifaximin was started with good improvement in her
encephalopathy.  Nadolol and diuretics added during micu stay.
Nadolol to prevent variceal bleeding. lasix 40mg daily and
spirinolactone 50mg [**Hospital1 **]; recommend to increase the lasix as
needed to control LE edem
