Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
Pt presents with recurrent increasing shortness of breath and
was found to have stridor and was urgently transferred to the
Complex Airway Service at [**Hospital1 **].

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**6-3**] OR- rigid bronchocscopy w/ ballloon dilitation &
microdebridement
s/p bronchoscopy, tracheal resection and reconstruction ([**6-6**]),


History of Present Illness:
 Mrs. [**Known firstname 50528**] [**Known lastname 67192**] was received in urgent transfer on [**6-3**], [**2112**].  This is a 78-year-old female with a recent history of
a four-vessel
CABG with a complicated postoperative course that included
prolonged intubation and tracheostomy from which she recovered
at
a rehabilitation facility.  She was found to have a subglottic
stenosis, and a surgical procedure was performed, the details of
which are not available to me.  She presents now again with
increasing shortness of breath and was found to have stridor and
was urgently transferred to the Complex Airway Service at [**Hospital1 **].  We performed a rigid endoscopy today and
found
a typical triangular-shaped high-grade tracheal stenosis at the
level of the first and second tracheal ring.  There was no
tracheal web per se and the left lateral as well as the
posterior
wall, as well as the posterior membrane were freely mobile.  The
lesion is not amenable to endoscopic intervention but does
require surgical resection.

Past Medical History:
Diabetes Mellitus 2, Coronary artery disease s/p Myocardial
infarction s/p Coronary artery bypass graft x4, repair of
ventricular aneurysm compicated by pneumonia and adult
respiratory distress syndrome, Congestive Heart failure, Atrial
fibrillation,hypertension, acute renal failure, chronic renal
insufficiency, hyperthyroidism, depression, gastric esophogeal
reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, hypercholesterolemia, h/o
syphillis;
high tracheal stenosis s/p tracheal resection and reconstruction
([**6-6**]),


Social History:
Pt is french creole speaking. Lives w/ daughter, [**Name (NI) 67193**]

history
Home services w/ VNA from PACE Program, HHA
uses walker and nebulizer

Family History:
Pt has supportive daughter, son and grand-daughter

Physical Exam:
General: She is an overweight elderly female who is
anxious presently and on heliox.  She is placed with on heliox
overnight due to severe stridor and dyspnea, which was felt to
be
anxiety provoked.
VS: 98.2, 68 SR, 120/51, 29, sat 99% on 6 liters with heliox.
HEENT: PERRLA. Sclerae are anicteric.  Cervical exam, there is
no
supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.  Her cervical exam
reveals a relatively short neck with a tracheostomy scar just
above the sternal notch below
the cricoid where we previously witnessed a rigid bronchoscopy
by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which places the region just below the cricoid and
measuring less than 1 cm in width.
 Lungs: Clear to auscultation.
Chest: Thorax is symmetrical without lesions, masses.  She has a
well-healed
sternotomy scar.  She is stridorous with a respiratory rate of
29.
Cor: Heart is regular without murmur.
Abd: abdomen is benign without masses or tenderness.
Extremities show no clubbing or edema.
Neurologic is grossly nonfocal with intact and appropriate
mental
status, although she is anxious.


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2112-6-19**]:  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and borderline
interstitial edema are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or
appreciable pleural effusion.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2112-6-15**]  9:09:40 AM
Sinus rhythm. Borderline first degree A-V block. Borderline left
axis
deviation with possible left anterior fascicular block. Lateral
myocardial
infarction. Possible old inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2112-6-6**] multiple abnormalties persist and
there is no
significant diagnostic change.

ECHO:
Conclusions:  [**2112-6-14**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall  left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent) secondary
to extensive severe apical hypokinesis. An apical  left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. There is no
ventricular  septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not  present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly  thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is  seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is  no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:

pain. Found to have tracheal stenosis and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
ICU [**2112-6-2**] for evaluation and treatment.
[**2112-6-3**]- OR for rigid bronch ([**Name8 (MD) 67197**] MD) for the purposes of
tracheal ballon dilation to 12mm and microdebridement of complex
