History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9241**] is a 60 yo M with multiple myeloma
Doxil/Decadron/Revlimid C2D22 presenting for elective admission
for reduced intensity conditioning with clofarabine, ATG, TLI,
and allogenic SCT. Please see Heme/Onc and Rad/Onc notes in OMR
for more details. In brief, since [**2160**], the patient has
recurrent, relapsing multiple myeloma refractory to treatment
with Velcade, Revlimid, Doxil, and auto-SCT. Followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], and it was decided he would undergo experimental
protocol with reduced intensity conditioning with clofarabine,
ATG, TLI (to reduce the GVD effect) and allogenic SCT for the
graft-vs-tumor effect. He has been cleared by ID and cardiology
to undergo his auto-SCT. Should receive prophylactive ivermectin
the day of admission. Was seen by radiation oncology before
admission, will be receiving 800 cGy of radiation (10 doses of
80 cGy), with goal being suppression rather than myeloablation.
He has completely tapered his trazodone and is currently on
Neurontin 600 mg PO BID.
.
On ROS, patient admits to chronic fatigue and states his mood is
'so-so', but says the Cymbalta has helped with his mood. Denies
HI/SI. Denies fevers, chills, worsened shortness of breath,
chest pain, lower extremity swelling or DVT with Revlimid.
