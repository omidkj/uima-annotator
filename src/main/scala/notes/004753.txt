PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.6.  Pulse
of 100.  Blood pressure 96/56.  Respiratory rate of 16,
saturating 96% on 100% face mask and nasal cannula.  In
general chronically ill appearing, the patient is a pleasant
female in moderate
respiratory distress, speaking in short sentences.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat shows dry mucous membranes.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  The neck is supple.  There is no

and oriented times three.  She has left-sided upper and lower
extremity weakness 4/5.  The right side has 5/5 strength.
Sensation is intact throughout.  The reflexes are somewhat
spastic on the left when compared to the right.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 6.7,
hematocrit of 42.6, platelets of 358,000 with an MCV of 96.
Sedimentation rate is 4, that was on [**3-24**].  Sodium was
143, potassium 3.3, chloride was 105, bicarbonate 29, BUN 9,
creatinine 0.6, glucose of 104, calcium of 9.5, phosphorus of
3.3, magnesium of 2.2, free T4 is 1.1.  Arterial blood gases
done in the Emergency Department showed 7.28, pCO2 of 65 and
PO2 of 88.

IMAGING:  A chest x-ray done on admission showed no acute
changes compared with old.  It was clear.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further observation and
management.  Once she was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, they noted an increase respiratory rate and the
patient became increasingly hypoxic.  The team wanted to
intubate her at that time, but the patient declined.  She
wanted to continue to try to manage her own airway.  In
addition, she had coffee grounds, which were suctioned from
her G tube.  She was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for a
question of bronchitis and possible aspiration.  She was
started on Protonix b.i.d. given the evidence of acute
gastrointestinal bleed.

On the first hospital night, the patient had multiple
episodes of elevated respiratory rate, which were all
responsive to reassurance and Ativan.  The patient was
getting cool mist nebulizers continuously with good effect.
Her arterial blood gases in the afternoon of [**4-6**], showed
an improvement to 7.31 with a pCO2 down to 49 and a PO2 up to
184 on cool mist nebulizers.

The patient was transferred to the General Medical Floor on
[**2122-4-7**].  On arrival to the floor, the patient was
saturating around 90% on nasal cannula.  She was started on a
cool mist face mask and her saturation increased to 99%.  She
also was complaining left-sided rib pain, which hurt with
inspiration and movement.  She denied any other pain.  She
stated her breathing felt slightly "labored."

On exam at that time, significant findings included intense
pain laterally over the inferior costal margin on the left.

The rest of this dictation will be continued in system
format.

1.  Pulmonary:  Given the patient's shortness of breath and
sputum production, she was felt to have a likely asthma
exacerbation with possible bronchitis.  In addition, an
allergic reaction was felt to be a possible instigating
factor.  This seemed possible especially given her recent
trip to [**Location (un) 3844**].  She has a history of allergies in the
past.  She was started on [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg po b.i.d. as well as
beconase nasal spray b.i.d.  She was continued on Atrovent
and albuterol standing four times a day, as well as albuterol
and Atrovent nebulizers as needed.  Her hydrocortisone was
changed to prednisone 60 mg a day.  Her antibiotics were
discontinued as there was no evidence of active infection.
It was felt to watch her clinically and follow her cultures.
If she were to spike a fever, then antibiotics would be
re-instituted.  Each day, she continued to improve from a
pulmonary standpoint.  When she initially came to the floor,
she appeared somewhat lethargic and was likely retaining CO2
given her history of this in the past.  Her oxygen was
titrated down to maintain saturations around 93% and she
eventually became more alert and by the time of discharge,
she was saturating 93% on room air.

2.  Musculoskeletal:  Given her left-sided chest pain, a set
of plain films were obtained of her ribs which showed rib
fractures of the tenth and eleventh ribs laterally on the
left.  She was started on Percocet for pain relief with good
effect.  She did not have increasingly somnolence from the
Percocet, but was able to take deeper breaths given her pain
relief.  She was started on calcium and Vitamin D for likely
osteoporosis, given her long-term history of steroid use, as
well as immobility.  She may need to be started on Fosamax as
an outpatient. She was due for a bone density test during
this admission, which was scheduled for an outpatient,
however, she was not able to make this appointment.  She will
reschedule as an outpatient.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had an episode of coffee
grounds noted suctioned from he
