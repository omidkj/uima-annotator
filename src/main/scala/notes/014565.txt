Chief Complaint:
multifocal PNA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
34 yo male s/p unrestrained MVA 1 wek ago and he reports a
question of a thoracic fracture at that time. He reports pain
now in his groin, abdomen, LE, L chest, and back of the neck on
both sides.  4 days ago he developed worsening pain and found it
extremely painful to get up due to LE muscle soreness.  He
reports 5 days ago he began to have watery diarrhea 3-4x a day
with only 2 episodes on the day of admission. He drank large
amounts of water but had extreme thirst. He also notes feeling
dizzy. He started having fever up to 102.7 2 days ago and to 103
the morning of admission. He stopped making urine on Saturday.
For his pain he's been taking aspirin 2 tabs BIS, Percocet
5/day, he finished 4 pills of tylenol with codeine, and he's
been taking Ibuprofen 800mg 2 pills QID.  He denies any use of
cocaine.
.
He presented to the [**Hospital6 **] with vitals of T 98.1
BP 104/53 P123 RR20 96% on NRM.  He was found to have PNA,
transaminitis ARF, hyponatremia, gap of 19 with bicarb 19, WBC
of 4.6, HCT 37.9, and plts of 67. In the ED CT scan
chest/abd/pelvis notable for multifocal PNA and LAD. At the OSH
he got ancef 1gram, 2L IVF, morphine 4mg, and dilaudid 1mg. In
the ambulance he received 2L IVF, zofran 4mg IVx1, 50mg of
fentanyl, and a duoneb. He got 2 additional liters of IVF on
route to BBI
.
On arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 **] vitals were T98.9 BP108/64 HR 133
RR24 86% on NRB (touble getting o2 sat likely never this low).
HR ranged 117-129 SBP 99-128/54-82 RRR 19-33. Labs additionally
notable for lactate of 2.2. Lung exam was notable for Rhonchi.
Pt tachypnic but speaking in full sentences. He made 1600cc of
urine in ED which was after 5L of IVF counting all the fluid
since arrival to [**Hospital1 34**]. He received Vancomycin 1gram IV x1,
levoquin 750mg IV once, and flagyl was ordered but not given
prior to transfer.  He also received NS x1 L, calcium gluconate
1gm x1, mg sulfate 2grams x1, and dilaudid 1mg IV x1. Urine tox,
urine lytes, and serum tox were pending at the time of transfer.

4. OSH imaging:
CT chest with contrast:
Dense parenchymal lung consolidtaion in LUL, RML, and RUL.
Multiple air bronchograms. Findings compatable with multifocal
PNA. No discrete pulm nodules.  No pleural effusions or PTX.
Multiple scattered axillary LN, pathologically enlarged 11mm
pretracheal/mediastinal LN and scattered mediastinal LN. 15mm
subcarinal LN.
.
CT abd non contrast:
Slightly increased attenuation of GB likely contrast. Liver,
spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, sm and lg bowel
unremarkable.  No LAD.
.
CT pelvis non contrast:
Multiple scattered pelvic and inguinal LN which do not meet size
for pathologic enlargement.
.
x-ray right knee: no acute fracture or dislocation

5. Imaging/diagnostics at [**Hospital1 18**]:
- Echocardiogram ([**2163-12-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal. Quantitative
(biplane) LVEF = 52 %. The estimated cardiac index is high
(>4.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
- Echocardiogram ([**2163-12-17**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
- CT spine and head with contrast ([**2163-12-5**]): 1. Multifocal areas
of parenchymal consolidation most compatible with multifocal
pneumonia.
2. Small amount of sludge within the gallbladder. 3. Intact
osseous structures, with no evidence of acute thoracic vertebral
body injury.
4. Multiple in number mildly enlarged axillary, mediastinal, and

retroperitoneal lymph nodes, for which correlation to exclude
lymphoproliferative disorders is recommended.
.
- CT torso ([**2163-12-8**]): 1. Interval worsening of multifocal
airspace disease as described above, including areas of
pulmonary consolidation along with extensive gr
