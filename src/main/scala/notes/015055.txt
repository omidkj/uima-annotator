Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
left hand pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal Echocardiogram

L wrist incision and drainage with pulse lavage washout and wick
placement


History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with PMH of ESRD on HD (MWF), CAD, PVD s/p R toe
amputations and left BKA, DM, HTN here with left hand
cellulitis. On Friday developed pain and swelling in his left
hand in the morning. He placed a heating pad on his hand without
improvement. Symptoms worsened with more significant pain. He
began taking percocets that he had at home. He denied any
fevers/chills but did develop blisters on 5th finger that he
attributed to heating pad being too hot. He has significant
neuropathy of both hands and feet. Given no improvement in
symptoms, he presented to the ED.
In the ED, VS: 98.7 80 128/62 18 96. Labs notable for WBC 13.6,
lactate 1.6. Received dilaudid 2mg IV x 1. Evaluated by hand
recommended splint and 1g Vanco.Blood cx sent and patient
received 1g vancomycin. No acute surgical intervention. Tapped
carpal joint for fluid but unable to aspirate any. Plastics felt
joint unlikely to be infected. Did have fever in ED of 101.4
though he was asymptomatic. He received tylenol 1gram PO x 1.
.
On the floor, he is resting comfortable with adequate pain
control.

Pertinent Results:
TTE (Complete) Done [**2193-5-30**]:
Conclusions:
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20
%). with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CT PELVIS W&W/O C  Study Date of [**2193-6-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
No identification of skin or subcutaneous lesions at the level
of the coccyx that could suggest pilonidal cyst.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) Study Date of [**2193-6-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Grossly normal hepatic echotexture without evidence of
hepatic abscess.
2. Cholelithiasis without other secondary signs to suggest
cholecystitis.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2193-6-3**] at 4:44:59 PM:
Conclusions
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20
%). No thrombus is seen, but apical images are suboptimal. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2193-6-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute infarctions of different ages with punctate infarctions
in the left centrum semiovale and corona radiata of more recent
occurence than larger infarction within the left posterior
occipital lobe; the overall pattern is suggestive of embolic
events from a central source, likely related to recent cardiac
surgery.
2. No specific evidence of hypoxemic-ischemic injury related to
cardiac
arrest.
3. MRA significantly limited by motion artifact. Apparent
globally decreased flow is demonstrated within the intracranial
left carotid artery; given limitations of study, findings
suggest more proximal ("inflow") stenosis in the neck, and CTA
of the cervical vessels may be obtained for further evaluation,
when feasible.
4. Fenestration of the proximal basilar artery.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE Study Date of [**2193-6-5**]:
Left ICA stenosis 80-99%.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2193-6-5**]:
CT PELVIS: There is no skin or subcutaneous lesion or tract
identified at the level of the coccyx to suggest a pilonidal
cyst. Mild edema is noted in the soft tissues, likely due to
third spacing of fluid. The presacral space is normal. The
rectum contains a flexi- seal rectal catheter. There is no free
fluid or free air. The [**Date Range 1106**] stent is again seen in the right
iliac artery. There is dense atherosclerotic calcification of
the visualized vessels.

TEE (Complete) Done [**2193-6-6**]:
Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20-25 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2193-6-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of restricted diffusion identified on
the left cerebral hemisphere and left occipital region which
appear more onspicuous on the corresponding FLAIR sequence,
indicating subacute stage. New foci of restricted diffusion
identified under the right frontal lobe (202:17). There is no
evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.

AVF/DUPLEX HEMO/DIAL ACCESS Study Date of [**2193-6-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Patent left upper extremity AV fistula for dialysis,
no evidence of intraluminal thrombus.

CT LUMBAR W&W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2193-6-14**]:
**PRELIMINARY READ** No epidural spinal abscess seen.
