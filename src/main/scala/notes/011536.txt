CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old from
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Manor, who was found down on [**5-14**] intubated in
the field for low respiratory rate and admitted to the MICU
initially.  The patient was subsequently transferred to the
CCU as he ruled in for a MI.  Also found to have pneumonia,
UTI, and hypernatremia with a sodium to 152.  The patient was
monitored overnight in the CCU.  Medical management was
provided for cardiac symptoms.  Patient was started on
Heparin and subsequently extubated on [**5-15**] and transferred
to the floor.

At baseline, the patient is wheelchair bound.  Reported
gradual functional decline over the past week.  Patient was
losing the ability to feed himself, less communicative, and
increased confusion.  Found down in the bathroom at the
nursing home.  At transfer, moving his eyes from side to side
and then deviated down to the right.  The patient was placed
in a C collar by EMS and was subsequently intubated.  No
medications were required for intubation.

Head CT on presentation showed no acute process and chronic
right CVA with evidence of acute sinusitis.  Again, the
patient ruled in for MI and evidence of ST depressions
laterally.  This was discussed with the Cardiology fellow on
call, who deferred acute intervention.  Family did not want
any major interventions.  Again, admitted to the MICU, and
a.m. CK-MB, CK, and troponins trended up.  The patient was
started on Heparin drip x48 hours and continued the drip on
the floor.

On [**2120-5-17**], the patient had an acute episode of desaturation
of 90 percent.  ABG was 7.29, 64, 142.  Patient was initially
started on vancomycin for possible MRSA pneumonia since
coming from a nursing home.  The patient's antibiotics were
switched.  She was initially started on levofloxacin, which
was switched to ceftriaxone.  Patient remained
hemodynamically stable at this time.

On [**5-18**], the MICU team was called to evaluate the patient on
the floor for change in mental status and failure to protect
airway.  Patient was found unresponsive, labored breathing,
but vital signs were stable.  An ABG at this time was 7.32,
63, and 98.  Blood sugar was 441 at this time.  Patient was
given 15 units of insulin.  EKG showed no acute changes.
Heparin was initially stopped.  Patient was sent for a head
CT with concern for acute bleed and subsequently transferred
to the MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Old right frontal CVA with left
residual hemiparesis.

Alcohol abuse.

Dementia.

Constipation.

Diabetes.

Multiple abdominal surgeries secondary to shrapnel.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Protonix.
2. Glipizide.
3. Aspirin.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Nursing home resident at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Manor.
Heavy history of alcohol in the past.  At baseline, was
wheelchair bound.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  Vital signs:
Temperature 99.0, blood pressure 140/44, heart rate 67,
breathing 24, and 100 percent on 100 percent nonrebreather.
Patient was lethargic, lying in bed, no purposeful movements.
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.
Positive horizontal nystagmus.  Unable to assess extraocular
movements.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Patient was
edentulous.  Neck was soft, supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, S1, S2, 2/6 systolic murmur at
apex.  Lungs with coarse breath sounds worse on the right.
Abdomen with minimal surgical scars, soft, nontender,
nondistended, normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Warm,
distal pulses intact.  Neurologically:  Arousable to deep
sternal rub.  Patient is able to wiggle toes, open and close
eyes, no hand movements.  Babinski is upgoing on the left
toe.  Skin showed evidence of deep sacral decube without
purulent drainage.

LABS ON TRANSFER TO THE MICU:  White count is 17.9 up from
10.2, hematocrit is 35.4, platelets 241.  Chemistries notable
for sodium of 137, BUN of 29, creatinine of 0.9 with baseline
of 0.2 to 0.7, glucose noted at 472.  Urinalysis at that time
showed no evidence of bacteria or red cells, however, urine
culture from [**5-15**] showed greater than 100,000 colonies of E.
coli.

Chest x-ray on [**5-17**] shows new right lower lobe infiltrate,
no evidence of CHF.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  Respiratory failure:  Due to
poor mental status, patient was intubated upon arrival to the
MICU.  This was for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
failure.  Change in mental status was thought to be due to
infection, dehydration, hyperglycemia.  After intubation, the
patient's oxygenation remained stable.

Patient was treated for his pneumonia, which was thought to
be secondary to aspiration with Zosyn and vancomycin.
Antibiotic coverage was broaden to include Pseudomonas.
Legionella antigen was checked, which was negative.
Azithromycin was added for a five day course.  The patient
was kept on aspiration precautions.  After complete treatment
with antibiotics, attempts were made to wean patient from the
vent, however, this was unsuccessful.  Patient demonstrated
minimal effort.  NIFs were checked, which were minus 23.
Patient demonstrated poor central drive.  The patient was
ultimately bronched without evidence of obstruction or large
secretions.  There is some evidence of pleural effusion.
This was assessed by Interventional Pulmonary team, however,
on two attempts to perform thoracentesis, there is no fluid
to take.  Patient was given Lasix for gentle diuresis and
thought to decrease pleural effusions, however, there is no
significant change.

In addition, the patient's mental status contributed to
difficulty to wean from the vent.  The patient remained
arousable, but still with difficulty protecting airway.
Ultimately, family discussion was held regarding withdraw of
care.  Aggressive measures were made to wean patient from the
vent. After multiple attempts with aggressive diuresis as well
as optimizing other factors such as nutrition, electrolytes and
mechanics, the patient remained ventilator dependent.  These
facts were closely communicated to the family during the hospital
course.

After discussing amongst themselves what the patient would want
in this situation, the family requested that aggressive
treatments be discontinued.  On the evening of [**2120-5-31**]
mechanical ventilation was discontinued at the families request.
The patient was extubated, and subsequently expired at 1 a.m. the
following morning.

UTI:  The patient was treated with full course of antibiotics
for pansensitive E. coli.

Hypernatremia:  Patient's sodium was initially found to be
152.  On presentation, it was 137.  There was some concern
for hypovolemia, which also may be contributed to poor mental
status.  Patient was initially given IV fluid.  This was
initially thought to be cause of poor mental status, however,
the patient maintained normal sodium throughout hospital
course.

Neurologic:  Initially on transfer to the MICU, no acute
bleed by CT, however, there was evidence of evolving infarct.
Neurology was consulted.  Patient was subsequently started on
Heparin, blood pressures, MAPs were maintained greater than
80.  No further remaining was performed.  Patient's mental
status did not improve.  Patient was subsequently started on
Dilantin for possible thought of seizure, however, this did
not improve.  This failed to improve mental status as well.

On the morning of [**2120-5-31**], patient's family requested
withdraw of care, and within three hours patient expired.
