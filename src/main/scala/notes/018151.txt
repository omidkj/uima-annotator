Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4071**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, A-fib with RVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84 yo M with a history of mitral valve regurgitation, [**First Name3 (LF) 8813**]
stenosis (unknown valve diameter as no TTE info) who brought in
by ambulance from PCPs office for tachycardia. Patient was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] from [**4-28**] to [**5-1**], for CHF exacerbation.
He had a TTE and CXR done there, and was noted to have MR and
AS. Apparently he was admitted with a shortness of breath, in
the setting of congestive heart failure, after drinking lots of
fluids after a gout attack. Awaiting OSH records. New atrial
fibrillation diagnosed on that admit and patient started on
metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], digoxin 0.125 every other day in addition
to lisinopril continued at 2.5 mg and lasix initiated at 20 mg
daily. Patient returned home but stated he felt fatigued and
weak prior to discharge. Over two days increasing fatigue, large
amounts of urination, with "bed wetting". No chest pain, sob,
focal weakness or deficit, cough, orthopnea, PND, palpitations,
lightheadedness. No fever, chills, N/V or diarrhea. As per
patient he did not take his digoxin when he left the hospital as
he was concerned about its indication. He also refused
anticoagulation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.4 P 140 BP 130/77 R 20 O2 sat
98% on 3L. Patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or
lightheadedness. Patient was given 500cc NS, Dilatiazem 10mg IV
x1, ASA 325mg po once, and Levofloxacin 500mg IV once. 500+ cc
NS given. Foley placed with greater than 1 L removed. No acute
change on EKG RBBB. Attempted dilt x2 with bp drop to 90. WBC
17.9, levo for presumptive pulmonary source. Cardiology was not
consulted and patient admitted for A-fibb with RVR, HF, and
leukocytosis. On transfer HR 130. BP systolic 100.
--------------------
Addendum -[**Hospital1 2025**] records

trans AV gradient is 22mmHg.

ECHO ([**2135-5-5**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. An eccentric, splayed jet of moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with a history of CHF, Atrial fibrillation, moderate to
severe AS, and MR, with recent admission at [**Hospital1 2025**] for CHF
exacerbation and new onset atrial fibrillation, presented with
weakness, afib with RVR. Initially admitted to MICU for atrial
fibrillation with RVR with heart rate in 100-150s, and
hypotensive. Likely hypotensive given tachycardia rate related.
Given Digoxin, CE sent (at baseline and not trending upwards).
Upon recs from cardiology, started on amiodarone gtt with
initial loading dose.  No anticoagulation due to patient refusal
to take medication.  Aspirin given, beta blocker started, and
digoxin was discontinued.

After being transferred to inpatient floor, patient was
continued on amiodarone and converted to normal sinus rhythm. He
was volume overloaded and diuresed to euvolemia. He was referred
to cardiac surgery for consideration for [**Hospital1 8813**] stenosis
surgical intervention which he will consider as an outpatient.

He was also found to be in acute renal failure on admission
likely post-renal given his acute on chronic urinary retention.
He had a Foley placed with greater than 1L output but was
asymptomatic with this. He described a history of chronic
prostatic enlargement and overflow incontinence therefore this
likely represents outflow obstruction from BPH. He failed a
voiding trial and was discharged on finasteride with a Foley
catheter and outpatient urology follow-up. Renal function had
returned to baseline at time of discharge.
