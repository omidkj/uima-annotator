Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for HTN and [**Hospital 33210**] transferred to the CCU s/p PCI with DES to
STEMI. The patient reports that he developed slowly progressive
substernal chest pain since 3 pm yesterday afternoon. Pain was
described as "burning chest pressure" that started at 3/10 and
peaked at 10/10, prompting his family calling EMS this evening.
Chest pain was associated with diaphoresis, shortness of breath,
and pain radiating to his right arm, jaw, and back, and the
patient reports that he was unable to get out of bed. Denied any
n/v, palpitations, LE edema, orthopnea, syncope or presyncope.
Of note, the patient recently underwent a lymph node biopsy by
ENT with pathology pending, and was also admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in
[**10/2148**] for chest pain during which he was ruled out for ACS and
underwent a negative persantine mibi.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 72 142/92 100%RA. Given ECG concerning for
STEMI, Code STEMI was called. The patient received ASA 162 mg,
plavix 600 mg, heparin bolus, integrillin bolus, and morphine 4
mg IV. He was then taken to the cath lab, where he received a
DES to his LAD. After his PCI, the patient had transient chest
pain, and so was transferred to the CCU for further management.

.
Currently, the patient is resting comofortably wihout
complaints. Denies CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, palpitations,
diaphoresis, abd pain, orthopnea, pain radiating to arm or jaw.
He does endorse some mild low back "achiness." At baseline, he
gets short of breath with walking 2 blocks.
.
ROS: As above, otherwise negative.

.
Difficult cross-match [**2149-3-18**]: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a new diagnosis
of Anti-E antibody. E-antigen is a member of the Rhesus blood
group systems. Anti-E antibody is clinically significant and
capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions. In the
future, Mr. [**Known lastname **] should receive E-antigen negative products
for all red cell transfusions. Approximately 71% of ABO
compatible blood will be E-antigen negative. A wallet card and a
letter stating the above will be sent to the patient.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**2149-3-17**]:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had a 30% ostial
stenosis. The LAD had a 90% mid stenosis after the first
diagonal branch. The LCx and RCA had mild luminal irregularities
but no angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated
left sided filling pressures with LVEDP 19mmHg. The systemic
arterial blood pressure was appropriate with SBP 128mmHg and DBP
75mmHg.
3. Sucecssful direct stenting of the mid LAD, just beyond the
takeoff of a diagonal branch, with a 2.5x13 mm Cypher RX DES,
postdilated to 2.75 mm at mid and proximal stent with excellent
results (see PTCA Comments)
4. Success closure of the RCFA with a 6F Angioseal with adequate
hemostasis
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease of the LAD.
2. Moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
3. Sucecssful stenting of the mid LAD with a Cypher DES
4. Successful closure of the RCFA with a 6F Angioseal
.
Echocardiogram, transthoracic [**2149-3-18**]: The left atrium and right
atrium are normal in cavity size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with edema and akinesis of the
mid- and distal anterior wall, anterior septum and apex (mid-LAD
territory), most c/w recent infarction. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
# STEMI: The patient presented with chest pain and was found to
have STEMI. He was taken to the cardiac catheterization, where a
90% stenosis of the mid-LAD was identified. PCI was performed,
with placement of a Cypher drug-eluting stent to the mid-LAD.
Echocardiogram subsequently revealed EF 30-35%. The patient was
discharged on aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, enalapril,
atorvastatin, nitroglycerin. He was also started on warfarin for
anteroapical akinesis (see below). Cardiology follow-up with Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 11723**] was arranged.
.
# Anteroapical akinesis: Tranthoracic echocardiogram revealed
akinesis of the mid- and distal anterior wall, anterior septum
and apex. Due to the risk of intracardiac thrombus formation,
anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated. The patient will
need to have his INR checked 1-2 times weekly for the while his
warfarin dose is titrated. Repeat echocardiogram should be
performed in [**1-29**] months, at which time the need for
anticoagulation can be reconsidered.
.
# Anti-E antibody: A routine type and screen identified an
anti-E antibody. The blood bank will send a wallet card and
letter to the patient.
.
# Impaired glucose tolerance: HbA1c was checked for risk
stratification and was 6.4. The patient will follow up with his
primary care doctor for further management of this.
.
# Dyslipidemia: Changed simvastatin to atorvastatin.
.
# Benign prostatic hypertrophy: Continued terazosin.
