History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with history of CHF, AF, TIA admitted to MICU from OSH
with GIB.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital on [**2187-7-12**] with two episodes
of red blood clots in his stool that morning.  He complained of
lower quadrant cramping at that time, without nausea, vomiting,
weight loss or any recent change in stool color, caliber or
frequency.  On initial presentation, pt's BP was 98/49 with HR
97, O2 sat 93%. Hct was 26.2, down from 42.4 ([**2187-3-17**]). INR on
admission 2.7.  The patient was hemodynamically stable
throughout admission to OSH. He was given 2U FFP, 1mg IV Vit K,
and 4U of PRBC with hct of 27.7. Had colonoscopy to terminal
ileum with preliminary report suggesting significant blood
throughout entire colon, (L>R).  There were multiple
diverticula, without a source of bleeding identified. There was
a 3cm polyp. Pt had a tagged RBC scan which showed active
bleeding in left midabdomen at the level of the descending
colon. The pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible exploratory
laparotomy vs. IR-guided angio procedure.

On presentation, the pt has no complaints. Denies abdominal
pain/cramping, chest pain, shortness of breath.  No further
bleeding per rectum.

PORTABLE AP CHEST AT [**2187-7-25**]: 13:12: Comparison is made to
[**2187-7-22**]. The newly inserted right PICC tip is in the SVC.
Right IJ line tip is in the SVC more proximally. Dual chamber
pacemaker leads are unchanged. There is a new external object
overlying the right lower abdomen, as the control box for the
pacemaker appears to be on the left on the prior study. There is
stable moderate cardiomegaly and marked pulmonary arterial
enlargement. There is worsening opacity in the right lower lobe,
and possibly in the left lower lobe, suspicious for pneumonia.

CT l-spine [**7-27**]:
1. L1 vertebral body compression fracture. Please see lumbar
spine CT scan of the same day for further details.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive
atelectasis.
3. Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. No fractures
identified.

ECHO [**2187-7-23**]:
The left and right atrium are markedly dilated. Left ventricular
wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild global
left ventricular  hypokinesis. The aortic root and ascending
aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not  present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric jet of at least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

EKG [**2187-7-20**]:  Atrial fibrillation with a somewhat rapid
ventricular response.Other than a somewhat more rapid rate, no
significant change from the tracing of [**2187-7-15**].

Brief Hospital Course:
1. GIB: Data from colonoscopy and tagged RBC scan at OSH shows
lower GI bleed, specifically in descending colon.
Diverticulosis, polyp, ischemic bowel.  Pt was monitored closely
in MICU, but bleeding scan and colonoscopy showed blood on
left-side of colon with oozing from diverticuli, no specific
source of bleeding.  Pt was called out from MICU and hct was
monitored on the floor.  Hct was stable.  Pt was started on TPN
which he received for about four days until he tolerated PO's.
Pt has had multiple brow bowel movement, none with frank blood,
only guiac positive.

2. CV/Rhythm: rate controlled on toprol.  Coumadin was held then
reversed with vitamin K/FFP.  ASA not restarted given that pt
was still guiac positive.  Anticoagulation can be restarted as
an outpatient.

3. CV/CHF: mild CHF exacerbation due to holding diuretics.  Pt
was re-started on toprol an lasix but at a lower dose than he
was on at home (80mg qd).  Pt put out well to 40 and 20mg, so he
was continued on 20mg po.  If his weight increases, pt
instructed to double dose of lasix.

Prior to discharge, pt was re-started on lisinopril and
aldactone.  These will be titrated back up as an outpatient.

4. Line sepsis: pt had fevers, blood cultures positive for MSSA.
 Central line tip culture also grew out MSSA.  Transthoracic
echo showed mild AS but no other major abnormalities.  Pt was
treated with Vanco [**Date range (1) 16125**], and then changed to Oxacillin [**7-22**]
which should be continued through [**8-1**].  Pt remained afebrile on
abx and follow up blood cultures were w/ NGTD.  Once antibiotics
are completed, patient should have surveillance blood cultures
checked.

5. "infiltrate" on CXR: pt was afebrile but splinting due to
back pain.  Pt given incentive spirometer and remained afebrile
without leukocytosis.

6. FEN: Pt was NPO during much of MICU stay so TPN was
initiated.  Pt was HD stable, therefore once he tolerated PO
diet, this was discontinued.

7. PPX: Pneumoboots. PPI.  Pt had history of SDH so he was
treeated with Keppra for two years.  Pt had no seziures, after
discussion with Neurology, this was discontinued.
