History of Present Illness:
78 y/o male PMH: DM2, HTN, COPD (FEV1 1.67), CAD s/p 7 stent
placements (4 in RCA and 3 in LAD) most recent on [**2133-7-19**] s/p
PTCA/brady in stent mLAD stenosis, systolic dysfunction EF
35-40% with global hypokinesis on [**2133-8-19**] .  He was admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2133-8-18**] with respiratory failure secondary to
multilobar PNA for which he had 2 days of productive cough and
SOB. His ABG on arrival was 7.37/41/68 (not clear if on O2), O2
sating in the mid 80's on RA, he was intubated and treated
empirically with levoquin and flagyl.  He was never febrile and
had no elevation in WBCs.  He was extubated within twenty four
hours of admission, however his initial CK of 68 and Trop T
<0.01 became elevated to 1259 and 0.38 respectively.  He was
admitted to CCU for management of cardiogenic shock s/p anterior
STEMI and emergent PCI.

CXR:  [**2133-8-18**] 6:38 am Airspace consolidation in the right upper
lobe and within the left mid-lung zone consistent with
pneumonia. The left costophrenic angle is blunted. The pulmonary
vascularity is normal. There is no pneumothorax
.
CXR:  [**2133-8-18**] 7:53 am The right and left mid lung zone
consolidations have increased in intensity and extent when
compared to the previous study. There is also a left-sided
pleural effusion and the right costophrenic angle has been
clipped from the film.

additional intraventricular conduction delay Possible prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction  ST-T wave abnormalities -
may be due to intraventricular conduction delay but clinical
correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of same date,

#3 Normal sinus rhythm, rate 98. Left anterior hemiblock.
Intraventricular
conduction delay. Possible old anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-4-26**] the
sinus rate is faster.
.
CXR:  [**2133-8-19**] 7:36 am Interval improvement of left upper lobe
consolidation with now increased left lower lobe consolidation.
The rapidly changing appearance of these consolidations raise
the possibility of recurrent aspiration, viral pneumonitis, or
possibly pulmonary embolism. These do not fit the typical
appearance of a bacterial pneumonia.
.
CXR:  [**2133-8-20**] 2:18 am There has been interval increase in the
bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities, predominantly in
a perihilar
distribution. There is also a left sided pleural effusion. No
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of bilateral interstitial and
alveolar
opacities consistent with worsening pulmonary edema vs.
multifocal pneumonia.

conduction defect - probably in part left anterior fascicular

correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2133-8-18**],
further ST-T wave abnormalities present

ECHO: [**2133-8-19**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Severe posterior
hypokinesis is present. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed.
3. The aortic leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for review) of [**2132-9-7**], the posterior hypokinesis may
be new

CATH:  [**2133-8-20**] INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Acute anterior
MI, cardiogenic shock.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single-vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild in-stent restenosis of proximal LAD.
3. Patent RCA stents.
4. Acute anterior myocardial infarction.
5. Cardiogenic shock.
6. Successful primary PCI of mid-LAD.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right-dominant
circulation with single-vessel coronary artery disease. LMCA had
mild
disease. LAD had a 60% mid-vessel in-stent restenosis, followed
by a
total occlusion between the stents in mid- and distal vessel.
There
were right-to-left collaterals supplying distal LAD. D1 had an
