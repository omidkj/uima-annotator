History of Present Illness:
81F with hx of Parkinson's Disease (nonverbal at baseline but
responds well with soft voice), chronic aspiration with h/o
aspiration PNA and J-tube placement now NPO, chronic foley for
neurogenic bladder, [**Hospital 35745**] transferred from nursing home to
[**Hospital 11694**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital (?[**Location (un) **]) for AMS and decreased UOP
with 50-80cc/day.  At Whittien, her BP was noted to be
130s-140s. WBC 24, dx'd with UTI, got vanc 1G at 2142 and cipro
400mg at 2040. Foley was changed. Creatine 3.2, trop 0.12-> got
ASA. CXR and CT head neg. She was transferred here because she
gets care here.
.
She was admitted from [**Date range (1) 61322**] last for MS change and treated
for HCP/aspiration pneumonia.
.
In the ED, conversation was had with brother [**Name (NI) 62336**] [**Name (NI) 15263**]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 62337**], who confirmed that his sister is DNR/DNI, would
not want pressors/central line but would want antibiotics and
fluids.
.
CXR in the ED showed pacemaker in place, low lung volumes,
slight increase in perivascular congestion without effusion or
consolidation. EKG showed V-paced. Head CT showed no acute
process.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98, 84, 112/87, 20, 90/3L. UOP was
275cc/6 hours.
Tox screen was negative.
UA showed >182 WBC, large lek and blood, mod bacteria. Lactate
was 1.8 from 4 initially. Electolytes showed K 3.9, Creatinine
3.2, BUN 74. WBC was 33 with N90, Band 1, Hct 34.1. Alb was 3.1.
Patient was given 4L NS for SBPs in 80s. She was also given
rectal tylenol.
VS on transfer were 65, 83/39, 23, 100/2L. She has 2 20G PIV.
.
On the floor, she is comfortable appearing. She is at first only
arousable to touch/sternal rub and then later has become
arousable to voice.

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, large acute
territorial
infarction or large masses. There is a hypodensity in the right
basal
ganglia, 2:17, likely old ischemic event, unchanged. Ventricles
and sulci are
prominent, likely age related. There is no shift of midline
structures.
There is improved appearance of the paranasal sinuses and
resolution of
previously seen opacity on [**2143-4-19**]. There is mucosal
thickening in the
ethmoid air cells. The mastoid air cells appear well
pneumatized. The
osseous structures appear within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Radiology Report PORTABLE ABDOMEN [**2143-7-11**] 8:14 AM
IMPRESSION: Non obstructive bowel gas pattern with no evidence
for free air.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2143-7-14**]):
      Culture workup discontinued. Further incubation showed
contamination
      with mixed skin/genital flora. Clinical significance of
isolate(s)
      uncertain. Interpret with caution.

Brief Hospital Course:
81F with hx of PD, chronic aspiration with h/o aspiration PNA
and J-tube placement now NPO, chronic foley for neurogenic
bladder, CAD, admitted for MS changes and septic shock, likely
secondary to urosepsis. Sepsis resolved within a day with
antibiotics and fluids.  Sensitivity came back with
.
Active Isssue:
# septic shock: Patient transferred from nursing home to [**Last Name (un) 4199**]
Hosptial with decreased level of alertness and decreased urine
output for 24-36 hours.  Found to have leukocytosis, acute renal
failure with creat 2.3 up from 0.5. Given antibiotics and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. In ED, Creat up to 3.2.
Given 4 L of fluid with some improvement in blood pressure which
had dropped to 80s systolic.  Troponin elevated. Patient
transferred to MICU for further care. In MICU O2 sats in 90s
without supplemental oxygen. BP was 100-105 systolic initially.
With fluids stopped, BP dropped within one hour to 90 systolic.
Mental status improved from ED; patient now able to answer a few
questions. Blood nd urine cultures drawn. Treated with cefepime
and vancomycin. Patient currently stable and afebrile with good
urine output.  Cause of sepsis most likely infectious given
leukocytosis and positive UA.  Differential less likely GI
source though is tender on exam, and CXR without clear
infiltrate. KUB shows no signs of obstruction. Cardiac etiology
may contribute to hypotension given elevated troponin (0.12) at
OSH. Trop here down to 0.05. EKG without changes but V-paced.
OSH cultures negative.  Urine culture here was noted have
PROTEUS MIRABILIS that was very sensitive.  She was started on
Bactrim via J-Tube due to concern for poor bioavailibility of
cephalosporins (as need to be converted to active form in small
intestins).  She improved and was discharged in stable
condition.

# Metabolic Encephalopathy: Patient trasferred from nurcing home
for decreased alertness and responsiveness. Patient returned to
baseline with fluids, antibiotics, and resumption of Parkinson's
medications.  Was likely due to infection versus uremia. Head CT
negative.  Patient returned to baseline after treatment of her
infection.

# acute renal failure: patient admitted with a Cr of 3.2.
Improved to Cr 1.5 (from 3.2 yesterday, baseline 0.5) with fluid
administration.  lytes WNL. FeNA=1.02%

# troponin elevation: Elevated to 0.12 at OSH in setting of
renal failure. Trop today 0.05.

# parkinson's Disease with dementia: Patient was worse than
baseline on admission, but improved with home regimen.  She was
continued on outpatient regimen of Sinemet.  Continued on
ropinirole 4 mg TID and entacapone 200 mg 4x
