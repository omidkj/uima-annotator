who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2132-6-23**] with a complaint of
abdominal pain. She states that she had an "upset stomach"
during the day on [**2132-6-23**], ate a small amount for dinner and

right-sided abdominal pain. She called EMS and was taken to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation. Initially, she had shortness of breath
worse than baseline (she is on O2 2 L/min PRN for COPD at home)
but per patient no chest pain or palpitations. She was placed on
CPAP by EMS, and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] records did complain of some chest
pain following use of CPAP. She had no vomiting, diarrhea,
changes in bowel habits or blood in stool. On arrival to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she was found to be febrile to T max of 104F. Labs at [**Hospital1 **]
showed elevated LFTs (transaminases in 500s, TB 1.8, AP 137),
WBC 21.5 with 19% bands, and RUQ U/S showed stones in the GB and
ductal dilatation felt to be consistent with a diagnosis of
acute cholecystitis. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP today
with a plan to return to [**Hospital3 **] post-procedure.

Reports
[**2132-6-26**] Chest Xray
IMPRESSION:
1. Small left pleural effusion and left retrocardiac opacity.
Mild right
basilar atelectasis.

overlying
structures and repeat imaging, if possible, to better evaluate
this region.

[**2132-6-26**] ERCP Report
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
moderate sedation. The patient was placed in the prone position
and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced
under direct visualization until the third part of the duodenum
was reached. Careful visualization was performed. The procedure
was not difficult. The quality of the preparation was good. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
complications.
.
Findings:
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Two non-bleeding periampullary diverticula with
large opening were found on the rim of the major papilla.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.

Biliary Tree: A severe diffuse dilation was seen at the main
duct with the CBD measuring approximately 20 mm. The dilation
was more pronounced in th proximal and mid-CBD and less in the
distal biliary tree. Many round stones ranging in size from 5 mm
to 8 mm were seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
Limited contrast injection was performed due to cholangitis,
resulting in limited visualization of the remainder of the
biliary tree.
.
Procedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A
small amount of self-limited bleeding occurred occurred after
the sphinterotomy.  Multiple bile duct stones were extracted
successfully using a 12mm biliary balloon [**Last Name (un) **].  A
sphincterotomy and stone extraction was performed given the
patient's age and co-morbid conditions in an attempt to decrease
number of procedures.  A stent was not placed as the
sphincterotomy maintained good drainage and the stones appeared
cleared.
.
