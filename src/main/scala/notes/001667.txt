Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain/Transfer for catherization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo male with a history of significant
vascular disease and CAD, including CABG in [**2194**] with LIMA to
LAD and SVG to OM and SVG to PDA of RCA, s/p BMS to distal SVG
to RPDA on [**3-/2206**], LCEA in [**2202**], and LAKA in [**2200**] as well as
multiple PVD procedures who woke up the morning of presentation
with some chest pain and heart burn after having a cup of coffee
with breakfast.  He states his isosorbide usually relieves
anginal symptoms, but it had not worked this morning.  He tried
sublingual nitroglycerine x3 as well with no relief.  His pain
was burning/sharp in nature, centrally located, without
radiation to the upper extremities.  He denied nausea, vomiting,
or diaphoresis with the event.  Given his symptoms, his wife
took him to [**Name (NI) **] for further evaluation.  OF note, the patient
had a similary presentation in early [**Month (only) **] where ACS workup was
negative for an MI.
  At [**Month (only) **], his chest pain was [**4-1**] described as "indgiestion".
VS at time of presentation were NIBP 107/56, Pulse 84,
REspratory 22, )2sat 90 % on RA.  T97.4.  EKG at that time
showed RBBB with new ST segment elevations in aVR, V1/V2 with
STD in V4-V6 as well as AVL,I.  Ol Q waves were noted in III,
AVF.  Troponin I at that time were elevated at 0.109 with CKMB
of 7.4.  Heparin gtt was started.  Patient was planned to have a
catherization for possible STEMI, however the [**Month/Year (2) **] lab at [**Month/Year (2) **]
was down and patient requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.
  At [**Hospital1 18**], patient transferred directly to the [**Hospital1 **] lab.
Received morphine prior to transfer with resolution of chest
pain.  There, a right radial approach was attempted, however
total occlusion of the right subclavian artery was encountered.
The radial approach was abandoned and femoral approach was
attempted via the RFA.  Angiography revealed a patent LMCA with
40% distal, 70% LAD, patent LIMA at touchdown, occluded LCX and
RCA, with Patnet SVG-RCA/SVG-LCX and LIMA-LAD.  Left subclavian
was also noted to be occluded when imaged.  Both carotids were
noted to be severely diseased with origin of the right SC after
spearate origin of the two carotids.  Also noted were 90%
occluded left and right external iliacs at CFA level.
Hemodynamics revealed brachial NIBP to be about 80 mmHg lower
than central blood pressures, with AO BP of about 150mmHg.  No
stents were placed at that time, and the patient continued to be
chest pain free.  He was transferred to the CCU for further
monitroing and eventual initiation of heparin gtt.
  In the CCU, the patient is in NAD.  Right groin noted to have
continual oozing from recent catherization site.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, denies CP, SOB, nausea, vomiting.  Has had
diarrhea for last 4 days and took loperamide the day prior to
presentation given diarrehal symptoms.  No blood in bowel
movements.  No dysuria or hematuria but endorses frequent
urinary hesitancy.  Denies joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools.
Has chronic angina.  No PND/orthopnea currently, although has
had HF exacerbations several times in the last several months.
