CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 47 year old male with newly
diagnosed mitral valve murmur who is a postoperative admit,
admitted directly to the Operating Room for mitral valve
repair.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47 year old man who
complained of a one year history of heart murmur found
incidentally by his primary care provider after he went to
see him for a shoulder injury.  He was referred to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 36828**]
a cardiologist who did a transesophageal echocardiogram which
revealed severe mitral regurgitation.  He was then referred
to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital6 256**] who
repeated the transesophageal echocardiogram and then
proceeded to cardiac catheterization in [**2149-10-16**].
Repeat transesophageal echocardiogram showed severe mitral
regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, normal left
ventricular function, PA systolic blood pressure of 42 and 4+
mitral regurgitation with mildly thickened mitral valve
leaflets and a partially failed mitral valve leaflet.
Cardiac catheterization showed a moderately dilated left
atrium, moderately dilated left ventricle.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function was normal.  Ejection fraction
55-60% with 4+ mitral regurgitation and no evidence of
coronary artery disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, treated
for the past year, mitral regurgitation and a left shoulder
fracture repaired with pins in [**2148-12-16**].

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Hydrochlorothiazide and
Univasc.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Occupation is a supervisor at PVE
Industries.  He lives at home with his wife and two children.
No tobacco use, no alcohol use and no other drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination prior to
admission was temperature 97.8, blood pressure 157/90,
heartrate 64.  Height is 64 1 inch, weight is 230 lbs.  In
general, this is a middle aged man in no acute distress.
Skin, no rashes or lesions.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat reveals pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements intact, nonicteric.  Mucous
membranes are moist.  Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy
and no jugulovenous distension.  Chest is clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm
with Grade III/VI systolic murmur heard best over the left
sternal border.  Abdomen is soft, obese, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds, no bruit or palpable
masses.  Extremities are warm and dry with no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  Varicosities, minimal in the right lower
extremity, none on the left lower extremity.  Neurological
was intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Palpable
femoral, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial and radial pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram is sinus rhythm at [**Street Address(2) 36829**] changes and normal axis checks.  White count 7,
hematocrit 40.9, sodium 144, potassium 4.4, chloride 108,
carbon dioxide 26, BUN 15, creatinine 1.0, glucose 203.
Chest x-ray with no active pulmonary disease and no
pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously the patient was a
direct admission to the Operating Room where he underwent a
quadrangular resection and mitral valve ring annuloplasty.
Please see the operation report for full details.  He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At
the time of transfer his blood pressure was 110/55 with PA
pressure of 29/60 and heartrate in the 80s.  He was
transferred with only Propofol infusion.  He did well in the
immediate postoperative period, however, he remained
intubated over night on the day of his surgery.  On the
morning of postoperative day #1 he was weaned from the
ventilator and extubated and in the late afternoon of
postoperative day #1 he was transferred to the floor for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.  On
postoperative day #2 the patient did experience an episode of
rapid atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response in the
160s.  He was treated with intravenous Lopressor and
Diltiazem and begun on Amiodarone p.o.  After achieving good
rate control, his Diltiazem was discontinued and he was
changed to oral Lopressor.  Over the next several days the
patient remained hemodynamically stable.  His activity level
was increased with the assistance of physical therapy and the
nursing staff.  On postoperative day #4 he was felt to be
ready and stable to be discharged home on postoperative day
#5.

At the time of discharge the patient's vital signs were
temperature 98.4, heartrate 74, sinus rhythm, blood pressure
125/70, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 94%.  Weight
preoperatively was 105 kg and at discharge is 113.2 kg.
Laboratory on the day prior to discharge revealed white count
9.8, hematocrit 22.8, platelets 140, sodium 141, potassium
