Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
female who was transferred from an outside hospital for a
hemothorax of her right lung after falling off a stationary
bicycle onto a wooden bedpost.  She had no loss of
consciousness, no vertigo, or palpitations.  Her past medical
history includes hypertension.  In the ER at the outside
hospital on [**6-30**], she was noted to have right rib fractures
and a pleural fluid collection.  On [**7-1**], a chest tube was
placed with 500 cc of blood drained.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital where an angio was done.  No
other source of blood loss was found.  The chest tube came
out on [**2106-7-4**].  The patient was briefly intubated during
this period.  The patient also experienced paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and has been diagnosed with a sick sinus
syndrome during her hospitalization.  A pacemaker was placed.
The patient was coumadinized only for 2 days secondary to
concerns for a rebleed.  After the chest tube came out, the
fluid reaccumulated and appeared of high viscosity.  So, the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for
further work-up.  She arrived on [**2106-7-10**].

ASSESSMENT:  The patient was admitted for a video-assisted
thoracoscopy and drainage procedure.

LABS AND STUDIES:  CT:  Hiatal hernia on left, right
hemothorax, atelectasis of right lower lobe.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day 2 ([**2106-7-11**]), the patient
underwent a right-sided video-assisted thoracoscopy with
evacuation of hemothorax.  The case was complicated by a
tracheal tear upon intubation.  Please see dictated op note
for further details.  Postoperatively, the patient was placed
on a CPAP mask, with 10 of pressure support and 5 of PEEP,
and was satting at 96 percent with a blood gas of 7.35, 52,
144, 30 and 2.  The patient's respiration rate was 23.  The
patient was also started on vancomycin, levofloxacin and
Flagyl for prophylaxis following the tracheal tear.  A chest
tube was also placed intraoperatively and was without an air
leak postoperatively.  The patient was postoperatively placed
on BIPAP because of saturations of approximately 90 percent.

On postoperative day 2, the patient had been weaned from
BIPAP and was satting 99 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula,
with a respiration rate of 17.  Her breath sounds were coarse
bilaterally, and the chest tube was continued on suction.
The patient on the previous day had had marginal urine
output, but had responded well to a bolus of IV fluids.  The
patient also had a hematocrit of 28.4 and was transfused with
1 units of packed red blood cells.  The patient also had a
bout of nausea for which she was given metoclopramide to
moderately good effect.  Her shortness of breath had
improved.  She continued to have a poor lung exam with
crackles bilaterally.

Diuresis was begun on postoperative day 3 starting with 10 of
IV Lasix.  As this had only a small effect, the patient's
Lasix was increased on each day until she reached 80 mg of po
Lasix [**Hospital1 **] which worked well.  The patient had a chest x-ray
with the chest tube on water-seal which showed no
pneumothorax, bilateral effusions, and improved congestive
heart failure.  The patient was also started on a regular
diet with Boost supplements.  Later on postoperative day 3,
the chest tube was pulled.  The patient was also noted to
have multiple PVC's, and her propranolol was increased to 120
mg qd, electrolytes were checked which were normal, and the
patient was preemptively given 2 gm of magnesium sulfate.

On postoperative day 4, the patient was noted to have a flail
chest in back which presumably had been there since the
patient arrived.  She, however, was not particularly short of
breath, and no treatment was undertaken.  Later on
postoperative day 4, the patient underwent a bronchoscopy
which showed a 2.5 cm nonhealing tear in the trachea just
proximal to the carina.  The patient was, therefore,
continued on IV antibiotics with the plan to repeat the
bronchoscopy in a few days to see if healing had begun.  Over
those following few days, the patient received aggressive
chest PT, aggressive diuresis, and electrolyte replacement.

On postoperative day 8, the patient underwent a repeat
bronchoscopy which showed good healing of the tracheal tear
with approximately two-thirds of the wound closed.  As the
patient was doing well and  healing well, she was discharged
to rehab later that same day.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  To rehab extended care facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  In addition to admitting diagnoses, the
patient had a traumatic right hemothorax on [**6-30**] and is
status post a right video-assisted thoracoscopy with
evacuation of hemothorax, complicated by an intraoperative
tear of her trachea near the carina.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Furosemide 80 mg po bid.
2. Propranolol 160 mg po qd.
3. Digoxin 125 mcg po qd.
4. Protonix 40 mg po qd.
5. Albuterol nebulizers.
6. Dilaudid 2 mg po q 2 h prn.
7. Acetaminophen 325 mg 1-2 tablets po q 4-6 h prn.
8. Miconazole powder applied qid prn.
