MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *6.0 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)

Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.4 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Aorta - Valve Level: 1.9 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aorta - Ascending: 3.2 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the body
of the LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body
of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
LAA. All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the left
atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
thickening of
mitral valve chordae. Torn mitral chordae. Severe (4+) MR.
Eccentric MR jet.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous
echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Torn mitral chordae are present. Severe
(4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Reason: Evaluate right pneumothorax

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
89 year old man with MR s/p CABG/MVR s/p chest tube pull. with
small right pneumothorax
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate right pneumothorax
PA AND LATERAL CHEST [**2119-12-17**] AT 08:42 HOURS.

HISTORY: Pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2119-12-16**].

FINDINGS: There is baseline emphysema. Evidence of prior CABG is
again noted. There are bilateral pleural effusions.
Near-complete left lower lobe collapse is also again evident.
Otherwise, there is no focal consolidation. The previously noted
right internal jugular vascular sheath has been removed. No
pneumothorax is evident.

IMPRESSION: Interval removal of right internal jugular approach
vascular sheath. Near-complete left lower lobe collapse.
Bilateral effusions.










Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to medicine service on [**2119-12-13**]. He had respiratory
arrest shortly upon arrival to the floor, and a code was called.
Echo showed wide open MR.  Intubated, taken emergently to the
cath lab.  IABP was placed.  He was found to have 2vCAD, and was
taken emergently to the OR for CABG X 3 (LIMA>LAD, SVG>OM,
SVG>RCA) and MVR (25mm pericardial).  Post-op he was taken to
the CSRU on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off by the
following morning.  He was extubated early am on [**12-15**], and had
his IABP removed.  He was transferred to the telemetry floor on
[**12-16**].  He went in to AFib later that day with a controlled
ventricular rate, and stable BP. He was started on coumadin for
this. He progressed slowly from a mobility standpoint, and has
remained hemodynamically stable throughout.  He is ready to be
discharged to a rehab facility to progress with ambulation and
independence on POD#6.
