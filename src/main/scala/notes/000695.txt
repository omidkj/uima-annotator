ED with sepsis to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  I am now being called for left

She was found unresponsive in bed at [**Location (un) 15383**] Home where
she lives, incontinent, fever to 104.  No seizure activity
noted.
+N/V for several days beforehand.  In our ED she was 104.8
degrees F and hypotensive to the 80's.  Her BP picked up with
IVF, she was given CTX/Vanco/Flagyl in the ED (now on CTX/Vanco
in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]), and steroids were increased to stress dose (from 20mg
hydrocort a day to 50 IV q6).  She had an LP yesterday that was
unremarkable.  No OP withdrawn, 4 cc obtained in the ED.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was noted to have left sided weakness at around
4:30am, team was notified at 7:30am, and neurology was called
around 9:45am.  Patient seen immediately.  Please see my exam

inferior dimensions.  dx'd ~5yrs ago per pt at BU. Patient was
admitted in [**10-21**] and underwent extensive evaluation of this
