[**2-24**] - xrays of her right knee show good hardware alignment
without evidence of fracture or other complications.

[**2-25**] - TTE (ECHO)
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2128-2-24**] and, later that day, was
taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5322**] for R TKA without
complication.  Please see operative report for details.
Postoperatively the patient had apnea and despite using CPAP,
developed respiratory failure and required intubation.  She had
some ST depressions on her EKG at this same time.  Cardiac
enzymes were sent and were negative.  She was transferred to the
the [**Hospital Ward Name **] and was admitted to the ICU.  She was extubated
on POD 1 and had no further respiratory distress.  She was
treated with CPAP at night.  An ECHO was obtained and showed no
wall motion abnormalities and a EF of 75%.  Repeat enzymes were
negative.  She was transferred out of the ICU to a telemetry
bed.  She had no significant abnormalities on her telemetry.
She did not have any chest pain or SOB after the ICU.

The patient received IV antibiotics for 24 hours
postoperatively, as well as lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting
on the morning of POD#1.  Starting on POD 2, the patient was
placed in a CPM machine with range of motion that started at
0-45 degrees of flexion before being increased to 90 degrees as
tolerated.***  The drain was removed without incident on POD#2.
The Foley catheter was removed without incident. The surgical
dressing was removed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was
found to be clean, dry, and intact without erythema or purulent
drainage.

While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by physical
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient's hematocrit was
stable, and the patient's pain was adequately controlled on a PO
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and
the wound was benign. The patient was discharged to
rehabilitation in a stable condition.  The patient's
weight-bearing status was WBAT.  The patient is to continue
using the CPM machine advancing as tolerated to 0-100 degrees.
