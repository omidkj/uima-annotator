History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 60 yo F transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for

persistent fevers. She has failed multiple ERCP stent
palacements. Per OSH records, she developed fever to 101.8 and
white count of 16.8 today prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 **]. Her
amylase/lipase have normalized. The patient underwent
tracheostomy on [**2198-7-12**] and was weaned from the vent on [**2198-7-24**],
and has been stable on trach mask w/ 10L O2.  Of note, pt has
been treated for VRE and CDiff during her extended
hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 60F with gallstone pancreatitis [**6-9**] with
unsuccessful ERCP
complicated by ARDS (now s/p trach) and severe pancreatitis
resulting in multiple pseudocysts with prolonged, intermittent
fevers. Was at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital/[**Hospital1 **] for extended period
with VRE from pseudocysts, pseudomonas PNA and UTI (treated with
amikacin, details unclear), and c diff treated with oral vanco.
Was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for futher management and possible cyst
gastrectomy.

The patient was admitted from OSH at the beginning of [**Month (only) 216**],
expressing suicidal ideation, refusing ventilator, refusing
surgery. Per psychiatry evaluation, patient having delirium,
currently denying suicidal ideation and expressing desire to go
ahead with further medical/surgical interventions.

Over the ensuing days, her affect improved, the suicidal
ideation ceased, and she agreed to treatment of her
pancreatitis. Upon transfer, was thought to be poor candidate
for cyst gastrostomy, and has been managed with multiple
pseudocyst
debridements - OR on [**9-10**] (placement of two drainage and
irrigation systems), [**9-14**] (necrosectomy), [**9-18**] (necrosectomy),
[**9-25**] (laparoscopic necrosectomy, 2 L flank drains placed, others
not changed, of note there was a concern for a possible enteric
fistula based on the nature of the drainge). She was found to
have stool leakage and then then underwent a CT scan which
revealed a pancreaticocolonic fistula. No small bowel fistula
was ever identified on Small Bowel Follow Through study. Based
on this finding, she was made NPO and put on TPN, which she
needs to continue on until surgical follow up.

She also underwent GJ tube placement on [**2198-9-5**]. The GJ is not
currently being used and should be clamped until after her
follow up visit.

As far as her infectious disease course during this
hospitalization, pseudocyst cultures have grown heavy
pseudomonas and sparse enterococcus. She had a BAL with 10-100K
oral flora and >100k pseudomonas ([**Last Name (un) 36**] to pip-tazo, tobra, but
intermed to meropenem and R to cipro). C diff was negative x 3
but was sent here on oral vancomycin and finished a 14 day
course.

She was on linezolid/meropenem/oral vanco then changed to
linezolid/pip-tazo/tobra (conventional dosing)/oral vanco. Based
on sensitivities of the pseudomonas and the enterococcus, was
then on a course of dapto, zosyn, tobramycin. At that time,
adequate drainage was in place after drains placed in OR, and
remaining positive cultures of drain fluid most likely
represented colonization rather than infection, and so once
completed over 14 days of antibiotics, they were discontinued on
[**9-20**].

Had a possible VAP with RLL infiltrate/collapse, BAL [**9-1**] done
and with 2+polys, grew pseudomonas, treated with zosyn and
inhaled tobra initially, and then iv tobra, and completed a
treatment course on [**9-13**] in case of a VAP or aspiration pna.
Antibiotics were then resumed when there was evidence of colonic
fistula formation. At the time of discharge, she was on IV
Ciprofloxacin and IV Tobramycin, which she should continue for 2
weeks until surgical follow up.
