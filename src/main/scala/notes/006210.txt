History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 66 year old woman with unknown PMH who is
admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress, altered mental
status, and hyponatremia.  History is obtained from the medical
record, as the patient is unable to give history and no other
sources of history are currently available.  The patient lives
in a group home and the manager of the group home apparently
called EMS because the patient was "not acting herself."  EMS
found the patient to be SOB and with O2sat 88% on RA with RR 30.
did complain of cough for 2-3 days, but no F/C, CP, or N/V/D.
.
In the ED, VS: 96.3, HR 103, BP 154/89, O2sat 99% while on nebs.
 Initially she was apparently wheezing and in some distress.
She was given prednisone 60mg, azithromycin 500mg, ceftriaxone
1g IV, and continuous nebs. She was then placed on CPAP.  When
her CXR showed CHF, she was given aspirin 325 and lasix 40mg IV,
and a ntg gtt was started. She put out 3.5L of urine to the
lasix.
.
The patient was about to be transferred to the ICU, when she was
noted to be more somnolent and difficult to arouse.  It was
decided to intubate her for airway protection.  Just prior to
intubation, ABG was 7.32/67/79.  She was given versed for
sedation and started on a propofol gtt.  She was then taken for
head CT and chest CT prior to coming up to the ICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea: The patient was intubated for airway protection and
was then extubated on [**2-28**], and continued doing well
post-extubation.  The patient was thought to have pneumonia
given her elevated the CTA chest read describing tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities, elevated WBC, and cough.  The patient was not thought
to be in failure as her BNP was 239.  Given the patient's long
history of smoking and emphysema on CTA, she was treated with
steroids.  Her cardiac enzymes were negative for two sets.  She
was treated while hospitalized with steriods, broad spectrum
antibiotics (vanc, zosyn, flagyl) and nebulizers while
hospitalized.  The patient was then converted to augmentin to
finish a 10 day course of antibiotics for her pneumonia.  The
patient was also discharged with a steroid taper.  She had
increased oxygen requirements when transferred to the floor but
was eventaully weaned off of oxygen supplementation.  Blood and
sputum cultures were negative at time of discharge.  The patient
requested assistance with smoking cessation.  She will be
discharged with zyban and instructed to use the nicotine patch.
.
# Hyponatremia - Slowly correcting since admission (Na 116 on
[**2-27**], upon transfer to floor 125). Etiology has been difficult
to determine. Had brisk diuresis in ED and MICU, and sodium
trended up. Urine sodium was subsequently less than 10,
suggesting that she may have crossed over from hypervolemia to
hypovolemia.  She also did not appear volume overloaded (no JVD,
no peripheral edema, MM slightly dry). She was started on
normal saline and her repeat sodium was normal and was stable
upon discharge.
.
# Leukocytosis -The patient's leukocytosis was attributed to the
pneumonia initially then to the steroids that she began during
her hospital course.  The patient was treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics and did not spike during her hospital stay.
.
# Hyperglycemia - denies history of diabetes, is now on
corticosteroid therapy, which is likely causing high serum
glucose levels. She did not require SSI while on the floor.

The patient's son was very involved during the hospital stay. HE
lives in [**State 4260**] and he was going to take the patient with him to
live with hinm in [**State 4260**] on the week of discharge. He was advised
to make a PCP appointment for the patient as soon as he reached
[**State 4260**] and to inform the PCP of this hospitalization. He was given
the business card and contact information for Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (NI) 21386**] (med attending) prior to discharge to give to the new
provider in case the doctor had any questions about this
hospitalization. It was also suggested to them that in case the
patient ended up not going to [**State 4260**] and living alone in MA, he
should arrange to more care eg VNA etc via the patient's
PCP/hospital.
