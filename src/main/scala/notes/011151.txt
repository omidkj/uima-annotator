Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of localized
perforation.  She was initially managed non-operatively, until
her pain worsened and her HR increased to 140s.  She was then
taken to the OR for exploration/lysis of adhesions, washout,
drain placement and jejunostomy placement.  Finding included
peritonitis with biliary fluid in the upper abdomen and pelvis.
Postoperatively she improved, but was noted to have a hoarse
voice.  She was maintained on TPN, kept NPO.  Tube feeds were
started through her J-tube and after several days, was titrated
up to a goal rate of 90cc/hr.  She was then taken for an UGI
swallow to eval for possible leak of her G-J and J-J
anastamoses.  Pt choked on the gastrographin and the study was
aborted when contrast was noted in the trachea.  Speech and
swallow and ENT evaluated her for hoarseness and inability to
swallow.  They determined that she was unable to tolerate
liquids by mouth (solids were not evaluated since pre-pyloric
leak had not been excluded) and that she had a paralysis of her
right vocal cord.  Pt was mainitained NPO until her voice had
noticably improved on POD 15 at which time she was cleared with
Speech and Swallow and tried with soft solids.  After tolerating
soft solids, she was discharged home with VNA to cycle her tube
feeds at night and to follow up with ENT and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**].
