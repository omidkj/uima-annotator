AFB cultures are still pending although all AFB smears are
negative from sputum and intra op pleural fluid and tissue.

Imaging:
.
Chest x-ray:
PA and lateral views of the chest. No prior. There is a
moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion. There is also
likely right
middle and lower lobe atelectasis. Linear opacity at the left
lung base suggestive of atelectasis and there is suggestion of
left apical calcified granulomas, but there is no confluent
consolidation or left effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is within normal limits. Hypertrophic changes are seen in the
spine. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior
cholecystectomy. Osseous and soft tissue structures are
otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion with
components of middle and lower lobe atelectasis.
.
Chest CT w/o contrast:
1. Large possibly loculated non-hemorrhagic right pleural
effusion could be entirely responsible for collapse of the right
lower lobe.
2. Contents of the right lower lobe indeterminate. Since
bronchopneumonia is present in the left lung I suspect there is
pneumonia in the right also.
3. Suggest echocardiography for evaluation of possible tamponade
from
surprisingly small pericardial effusion.
