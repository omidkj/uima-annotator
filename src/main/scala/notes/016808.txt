History of Present Illness:
50 y/o M w/Alport syndrome, ESRD on HD, CHF, HTN, who presented
to the ED last pm c/o left sided chest pain.  Per the notes, the
pt developed left sided chest pain at rest, constant, lasting 2

transferred to the MICU for further care.

COMPARISON: [**2187-9-19**].

FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal
extra-axial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift. The
ventricles are normal, and the cisterns are patent. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interface is preserved. The visualized
paranasal sinuses are clear. A loop of the orogastric tube is
present in the nasopharynx.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o AAM w/PMHx significant for Alport's disease and ESRD on
HD, with numerous past admissions for hypertensive emergency and
altered mental status.
Patient was initially found to have hypertensive emergency, with
systolic blood pressures in the 260s with signs of end-organ
damage (flash pulmonary edema and altered mental status.)  It is
unclear whether this is due to worsening renal fxn, increased
volume load with a two day delay since prior hemodialysis, or
drug use, with history of prior cocaine use. Patient was placed
on a nitroglycerin drip initially, and was hemodialyzed
urgently. He was then placed back on metoprolol and lisinopril
as well. His serum toxicology screens were sent and were
positive only for tylenol. His lethargy improved as well with
improvement in his blood pressure, and on discharge was alert
and oriented. His head CT was negative.
*
Patient was initially found to be in hypoxic respiratory
failure, and was intubated. This was thought due to flash
pulmonary edema in setting of hypertensive emergency. Patient
received hemodialysis, and was extubated after hemodialysis. On
discharge, he had a clear lung exam and good oxygen saturations
on room air.
*
Patient initially presented with complaints of chest pain, with
negative cardiac enzymes except for positive troponin in setting
of ESRD. EKG showed no ischemic changes. He was continued on
ASA, BB, and ACEI. His LDL in [**2185**] was 83, indicating no need
for initiation of a statin.
*
Patient initially had leukocytosis, likely in setting of stress.
 Patient remained afebrile and was not started on antibiotics.
*
Patient was noted to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis, with
AG 26, likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis, and
returned to baseline with dialysis. He was also noted to have
metabolic alkalosis, of unclear etiology.
*
Patient has ESRD secondary to Alport's, with history of 2 failed
transplants in past. He was continued on sevelamer, and
continued on hemodialysis. His pruritus was thought secondary to
uremia and he received a course of steroids. He also had
restless legs, for which he was discharged home on mirapex. His
ferritin level was checked and was elevated.
*
Patient remained full code throughout his hospital stay. He was
discharged to home in stable condition.
