HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  As per MICU Admission Note.

75 year old female with extensive past medical history, most
recently complicated by incarceration of a bowel at stoma
from prior colectomy for colon cancer.  Recent admission in
[**2196-1-27**], with maroon stool and found to have the
incarcerated parastomal hernia and status post colectomy and
ileostomy.  The patient also had a recent admit on [**2196-2-27**], with urinary tract infection and was sent to
rehabilitation and then readmitted in [**2196-3-26**], with
decreased p.o.'s, feculent emesis and also found to have
prerenal failure and urinary tract infection of that improved
significantly with hydration.  The patient also has a past
medical history of severe depression and question of
Parkinsonism.

She was at rehabilitation when she started feeling nauseous
for a few days.  A Chem 7 at rehabilitation revealed a
hyperkalemia to 7.  She was sent by ambulance to [**Hospital6 1760**] and along the way became
unresponsive.  She soon recovered respiration and pulse but
remained unresponsive and arrived at the [**Hospital6 1760**] EW without a pulse.  The
patient was asystolic and CPR was initiated x one minute in
which the patient received Epinephrine, an amp of Atropine,
an amp of Calcium Chloride, 10 units of Insulin, D50
Bicarbonate then another amp of Epinephrine, another amp of
Calcium Chloride and more Bicarbonate.  The patient was then
intubated for airway protection.  The patient also became
hypotensive to a blood pressure of 69 and she was given four
to five liters of normal saline as a fluid rehydration.  At
this time her potassium was found to be 8.9 and her
Bicarbonate was 10 and a blood gas demonstrated pH of 7.2;
PO2 of 128; PCO2 of 20.  During this CPR, the patient had
various runs of brady and tachy cardias, all with wide
complex QRS.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  Blood
pressure, 116/39; pulse, 146; 87% with a poor wave form.  The
patient was intubated and sedated.  Pupils were equal and
reactive.  Sclera were anicteric.  The patient had an
otherwise unremarkable examination with cool extremities.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION SHOWED:  Sodium, 123; potassium,
8.9; chloride, 89; bicarbonate, 10.  BUN, 99; creatinine,
4.8.  Glucose, 309.  Free calcium, 1.87.  White blood count,

magnesium, 2.8; phosphorus, 10.3.  Arterial blood gases,
7.2/20/128.

The patient was admitted overnight to the MICU.  She was
rehydrated aggressively with normal saline and her
electrolytes abnormalities self-corrected as well as her
renal failure.  She was then transferred to the Floor.

EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:  Afebrile; blood
pressure, 108/45; pulse, 75; respirations, 13; 100% on three
liter nasal cannula.  Central venous pressure, 9 to 10.  The
patient had had 2,026 of intravenous fluid in/2,020 of urine
out and only 200 of ostomy out.  General, alert and oriented
x 2.  Pleasant.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils
are equal and reactive to light and accommodation.  Anicteric
sclera.  Mucous membranes, moist.  Neck, no jugular venous
distention.  Right IJ in place.  Chest, clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm.  S2, soft
systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Abdomen had normal active bowel sounds.  Old ostomy site was
clean, dry and intact.  The new ostomy bag showed dark stool.
Abdomen was nontender, nondistended with no organomegaly.
Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurological,
strength, [**5-30**], bilateral upper and lower extremities.  There
was a tremor of initiation greater on the right than left
side.

White blood count, 13,000, down from 27,000.  Hematocrit, 25,
down from 38 and stabilized at 25, status post large volume
hydration.  Platelets, 319.  Sodium, 143; potassium, 3.7,
down from 8.9; bicarbonate, 27; chloride, 105.  BUN, 45, down
from 99; admission creatinine, 1.3, down from 4.8 on
admission.  Glucose, 152.  Troponin, 5.9; CK, negative x 3.
The troponin peak was 5.9; next one was 4.2 six hours later.
ALT, 11; AST, 17.  Alkaline phosphatase, 43.  Calcium, 9.3;
magnesium, 1.7; phosphorus, 3.4; amylase, 66; lipase, 185.

Electrocardiogram, initially on admission, showed sinus
rhythm with prolonged PR of 224; prolonged QRS of 142; large
R wave in V1 and V2 with poor R wave progression and T wave
depressions V1 through V5 that were new.

On [**2196-5-11**], the patient had an electrocardiogram with slow
atrial flutter with ventricular rate that was irregular at 25
beats per minute with peak T waves.  This was her admission
electrocardiogram.

Renal ultrasound done showed kidneys of 10 and 11 cm with no
hydronephrosis.  Incidentally, positive gallstones were
noted.  A chest x-ray, initially on admission, showed
perihilar haziness consistent with mild congestive heart
failure and on the next day, [**2196-5-12**], showed improved
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75 year old female with ileostomy
and multiple abdominal surgeries, depression, who is admitted
with acute renal failure leading to hyperkalemia and acidosis
leading to cardiac arrest.

The patient improved dramatically with rehydration with
correction of her renal failure and electrolyte abnormalities
after less than 24 hours of rehydration.  It was felt that
the patient, due to her depression, was not taking good p.o.
and also had some large ostomy output and became gradually
dehydrated, leading to prerenal failure and subsequent
hyperkalemia/acidosis.

1.  Renal - Prerenal/Acute renal failure in the setting of
dehydration secondary to poor p.o.'s and large ostomy output
likely.  This was improved with intravenous fluids.  Negative
renal ultrasound.  The renal failure rapidly corrected with
intravenous hydration and was stable throughout the remainder
of the admission.  On day of discharge, her creatinine was
0.6 with a BUN of 9.

2.  Cardiology - The patient was status post PEA arrest in
the setting of acidosis and hyperkalemia of 8.9.  After
correction of her potassium and acidosis and intravenous
hydration, the patient was revived and remained stable for
the remainder of the hospitalization.

3.  Electrophysiologic - The patient had one episode of
atrial fibrillation, status post her cardiac arrest that was
electrically cardioverted.  The patient remained in sinus
rhythm after cardioversion.  She did have a troponin of 5.9
status post cardioversion that was likely the result of
shock.  Her TSH was normal.

4.  Pump - The patient had some mild congestive heart failure
after her PEA arrest that was likely due to pump dysfunction
corrected status post resumed sinus rhythm.  She has no
further episodes of congestive heart failure.

Regarding the Troponin, this is most likely secondary to
cardiac arrest and electrocardioversion and resolved after
these interventions.

5.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition - The patient, on
admission, had severe hyperkalemia secondary to acute renal
failure that was corrected upon admission with calcium,
Insulin, intravenous fluid hydration and resolution of her
acute renal failure.  She also had an anion gap acidosis
likely also secondary to her acute renal function and also
resolve after intravenous fluid hydration and bicarbonate
