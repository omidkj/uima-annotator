Brief Hospital Course:
82M admitted with abdominal pain and was found to have a small
bowel obstruction. He was initially treated for a urine culture
growing e.coli.  While being observed the patient went into
atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 130's which rate improved
with lopressor.  He has a history of atrial fibrillation.
Patient was initially observed but failed to improve clinically,
complaining of increased abdominal pain.  He underwent
exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions, with repair of
two enterotomies made during the operation.

Neuro: Post-operatively there were periods where he was
delerious and not oriented.  This was attributed to narcotic
analgesia and disrupted sleep.  The narcotics were discontinued
and a geriatrics consult was placed.  Seroquel was recommended
for sleep and his mental status has cleared off narcotics.  He
is on tylenol, ultram, and motrin for pain control.

CV: He was hypotensive requiring pressor support in the
immediate post-operative period.  These were able to be weaned
off and he has remained hemodynamically stable.  He did require
an amiodarone gtt for a-fib with rapid ventricular response.  He
has been transitioned to PO amiodarone and lopressor.  He is
currently rate controlled.  He was transiently hypertensive
requiring additional IV hydralzine.  His blood pressure is now
stable on his home antihypertensive regimen.

Pulm: He remained intubated in the immediate post-operative
period as he was resuscitated and supported through his septic
episode.  He was extubated without difficulty and on his
outpatient regimen of combinvent.
.
GI: While he was NPO he was started on TPN and then tube feeds.
He was then advanced to a regular cardiac/renal diet without
difficulty.  He is having normal BMs and passing flatus.  He did
have some spotting of BRBPR for 2 days.  He was examined and
there were no hemorrhoids seen.  His spotting stopped.  His
hematocrit remained stable.
.
GU: He required lasix diuresis as his dry weight was up a number
of kilograms.  He is now voiding without difficulty.
.
FEN: He was on TPN for a few days post-operatively while waiting
for bowel function to return.  He is currently on a regular
diet.
.
Heme:  His hematocrit has remained stable post-operatively.  His
coumadin was held.  He can resume his coumadin per his
cardiologist's discretion.  He has remained in good rate control
on amiodarone and lopressor.
.
ID: He was treated with broad spectrum Vanc and Zosyn for
sepsis.  His cultures have ultimately grown no bacteria and no
source was isolated.  He complete a course of antibiotics and
has remained afebrile with a normal WBC.
.
Dispo:  Physical therapy was consulted and it was recommended
that he be discharged to rehab for additional physical therapy
services.
