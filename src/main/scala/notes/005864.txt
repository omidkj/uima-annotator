Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the West 3 service and taken to
the operating room on [**2134-5-31**] for a repair of her complicated
incarcerated ventral
incisional hernia.  The procedure included plastic surgery for a
component separation and ob/gyn for a total abdominal
hysterectomy (reader referred to the respective Operative Notes
for details). After the procedure in the operating room,
patient's respiratory status worsened, she was re-intubated and
transferred directly to the ICU.

The patient had an extended stay in the ICU where major issues
including monitoring her abdominal compartment pressures for the
development of abdominal compartment syndrome and stabilizing
respiratory status. After she was extubated and transferred to
the floor, the patient was discovered to have bilataral PEs and
was bridged to coumadin therapy and she also had a leukocytosis
secondary to a respiratory process.

In further detail, by pertinent system:

Respiratory:
Her ventilator settings went from PEEP/PS 16/8 to 24/10 in
response to continued worsening of respiratory status.  Patient
showed signs of fluid under-resuscitation and received multiple
boluses of albumin in addition to crystalloid.

On POD 1 and 2, patient remained intubated and effort to wean
respirator from 80% FiO2 was unfruitful. Her respiratory status
was concerning for atelectasis vs. PE.  Lower extremity dopplers
did not show evidence of DVTs.

Ventilator wean attempt was made again and this time successful,
decreasing FiO2 to 60%, then 50%.  By POD 4, she was
transitioned to CPAP, paralytics stopped and sedation minimized
and by POD 5, she was extubated.  Also on POD 5, she was started
on TPN to bridge nutritional status until the return of bowel
function and diet.

On POD 6, with stable respiratory status, she was transferred to
the floor, on TPN and NPO.  Patient was OOB and ambulating but
during her first night on the floor, she complained of mild
shortness of breath which gradually improved through the morning
of POD 7.  She also had two small bowel movements and her diet
was advanced to sips of clears.

On POD 8, patient showed worsening leukocytosis, now at 14.3
(from 12 on POD 7 and 10.3 on POD 6) but had no more complaints
of shortness of breath.  UA, UCx, CXR ordered (all negative for
infectious process) and the foley catheter was removed.

On POD 9, Ms. [**Known lastname **], who was afebrile and not in respiratory
distress, had CT angio which was positive for multifocal
bilateral pulmonary emboli.  She was started on a heparin drip
at 9300 units initial bolus and 2100/hr which was adjusted over
the next two days from supratherapeutic (PTT>150) to therapeutic
PTT (67.3) at a rate of 1200 units/hr on POD 10.  She was dosed
with 2 mg of coumadin from POD 9 through POD 13.  Her heparin
drip was stopped on POD 11 and switched over to low molecular
weight heparin (lovenox) at 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] to ease transition to
discharge.  Her INR level went from 1.4 (POD 9) to 1.9 (POD 12)
to 2.3 (POD 13) to 2.9 (POD 14, day of discharge).  On day of
discharge, patient was instructed to take 1 mg of coumadin to be
followed by 2 mg daily until she followed up with her PCP within
three days.

Neuro:
Patient had no major neurological issues during her stay. In the
ICU, she was on a versed and fentanyl drip for sedation and
gradually weaned to complement the respiratory ventilator wean
attempts.  Paralytics were stopped entirely on POD 5.

GI:
Patient was NPO during her ICU stay.  She was started on TPN on
POD 5.  She was advanced from NPO to sips of clears on POD 6,
after transfer to the floor.  She tolerated it well and was
successfully advanced to a regular diet on POD 7. Her TPN was
stopped on POD 7.  During her stay, her electrolytes were
carefully monitored and repleted as necessary.

GU:
In the immediate days post-operatively, bladder pressures were
measured q6 hours to assess for the development of compartment
syndrome.  Bladder pressures remained in the low twenties and
transitioned to the high teens during POD 1 and 2 and to the
mid-teens therafter.

CV: Patient received three units of PRBCs post operatively.  On
POD 2, in response to Hct in the low twenties compared to 31.8
pre-op, she was transfused with one unit PRBCs.  On POD 3,
patient received 2 units of PRBCs.  Hct responded to the low
thirties.  On discharge, her Hct was 29.9.

ID: Leukocytosis, as discussed above.  Her WBC continued to
remain elevated after POD 7 (14.3).  CXR done on POD 7 showed
ambiguous opacities in the left lobe consistent with atelectasis
but unable to rule out pulmonary infection.  This remained
largely unimproved on POD 9 when her WBC count was 17.1.  She
was started on antibiotics of vancomycin, levofloxacin and
cefepime as empiric therapy to cover for nocosomial pneumonia;
vancomycin and cefepime were stopped on POD 11 for low suspicion
of nocosomial pneumonia, leaving only levofloxacin from POD 11
onwards.  Her white count was trending down on discharge, from
15.4 (POD 12), 11.4 (POD 13) and 10.0 (day of discharge, POD
14).

Drains:
Patient had two [**Doctor Last Name **] drains placed in the superficial lateral
aspects of the wound.  Output gradually decreased throughout her
stay after several days of decreasing output and 0 ml during POD
13, the JP right-sided [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was removed.  The left sided
[**Doctor Last Name **] drain continued to put out smal amounts (25 ml) on
discharge and was left in for removal during followup.

On day of discharge, patient was afebrile, vital signs stable,
ambulating, tolerating PO, at therapeutic INR and plans for
follow up.  She was discharged home with VNA services for wound
and drain care on POD 14.
