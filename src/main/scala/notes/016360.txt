None

History of Present Illness:
50F with asthma, OSA, UC, anxiety/depression with recent
admission [**1-29**] for asthma exacerbation presents from home with
chief complaint of dyspnea for 2 days. Presented to ED, unable
to speak in full sentences, wheezing on exam, no chest
discomfort. EKG unchanged, CEs x 1 negative. Got nebs, Mg and
steroids. Improved temporarily on bipap, decompensated when off,
ABG off BiPAP: 7.32/56/39, however repeat improved 7.37/46/160
RLE swelling, d-dimer nl, LENIs done
In ED VS:
HR 80s, 100% BiPAP 140/72 afebrile
Transfered to ICU for BiPAP, management of respiratory issues.
On arrival pt in respiratory distress, receiving continuous
nebs. Reports feeling like she was getting a cold 2 days ago,
she developed worsening dyspnea over this time. This is her
typical presentation for an asthma flare however she states this
is the worst it has ever been. She has been hospitalized for
asthma exacerbations before but has never required intubation or
ICU care. She reports increased cough and production of thick
white sputum in the absence of fevers. Has had more "air hunger"
lately with increased use of inhalers at home. She has tried
using her CPAP during the day for relief. She also has taken
40mg of prednisone daily for the past 2 days without noting an
improvement in her symptoms. At baseline pt is unable to walk up
1 flight of stairs without stopping for dyspnea. She can
ambulate around her house, but otherwise is severely limited in
her exercise capacity, she has been at this level for
approximately the past year. She endorses 5 pillow orthopnea.
Mild HA, not new for her. Denies chest discomfort, hearburn,
n/v/abd pain, has some loose stool reporting irregular bowel
habits are normal for her UC, no dysuria, some increased RLE
with decreased sensation for the past 2 days without inciting
event, improved with wrapping/elevation.
States she is depressed especially in setting of her acute
illness and is very anxious about not being able to breathe,
denies SI.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2173-4-8**] 10:52 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for cardiopulm process

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 yo F severe asthma/COPD p/w SOB, no F/C, no CP, exam c/w
reactive airways w/o focality
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for cardiopulm process
HISTORY: Asthma, COPD, shortness of breath.

COMPARISON: [**2173-1-21**].

FINDINGS: AP view of the chest in upright position is limited
due to underpenetration. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. There is no pneumothorax, consolidation, pleural
effusion. Low lung volumes. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: Limited study. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
====================================================
ECG:
Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to
the previous
tracing the rate is slower

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT

Reason: eval for DVT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 yo F severe asthma/COPD p/w SOB, no F/C, no CP,notes RLE
swelling over few weeks, no h/o DVT
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for DVT
HISTORY: COPD, shortness of breath. Rule out DVT.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: Ultrasound evaluation of the right lower extremity
deep venous system using grayscale, color, and pulse wave
Doppler reveals the veins to be fully compressible with normal
color flow, Doppler waveforms, augmentation, and respiratory
variation in flow.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT involving the right lower
extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 year old woman with asthma, OSA, depression/anxiety, Obesity,
UC presents with SOB.
.
ICU course:
#Respiratory: Initial as showed respiratory acidosis and
hypoxia, however suspect this was venous. Repeat was near
normal. Ddx includes asthma flare, Pickwickian syndrome. CXR
possibly showed fluid overload, however no crackles on exam or
history of CHF, recent normal ECHO, cardiac etiologies unlikely
especially in setting of negative enzymes and unchanged EKG. No
fevers, no leukocytosis with increased sputum production, no
infiltrate on CXR. Not susicious for PNA or infection, although
bronchitis possible. In absence of objective findings will hold
on antibiotics for now. Nl d-dimer with RLE swelling, u/s read
pending. PE likely in setting of nl D-dimer.
-High dose steroid burst with IV solumedrol 125mg Q6 with taper,
pt did not respond to home tx with 40mg prednisone.
-CPAP, home settings 12cm h20

-Continuous albuterol nebs, ipratropium
-continue home monteleukast, zileuton
-f/u RLE u/s read although low liklihood PE esp with nl D-dimer

.
#OSA.
-CPAP, 12cm h20 at night
-Modenafil
.
#RLE swelling: Very subtle on exam. D-dimer nl. Not suspicious
for DVT.
-f/u RLE u/s.
-Tylenol PRN pain
-Wrap and elevate
.
#UC. Continue Mesalamine.
.
#Depression with psychotic features. Continue fluoxetine and
aripiprazole
.
#GERD. PPI
.
#HTN. Continue diltiazem with parameters
.

FLOOR COURSE:
ASTHMA exacerbation:  Solumedrol transitioned to prednisone.
Pulmonary status at baseline by discharge. Right lower extremity
non invasive read as no DVT. Slow prednisone taper on discharge.
 Tiotropium, advair.
