Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
60 yo female with a PMH of CAD s/p MI, RHF s/p AICD placement,
SLE, pulm HTN, COPD, and recent PE presents from
[**Hospital3 **] center for acute desaturation to 50's
(home 2LNC at baseline). Patient reports feeling short of breath
at that time but cannot recall any event leading to this. She
was not eating (?asp) or exercising. Her husband feels she is a
bit more confused than at baseline.
.
Patient was evaluated by nursing staff at her rehab center. Her
VS were 97.8 85 109/66 93%. She was found to have an ABG of
7.35/57/75/30 and CXR with b/l pleural effusions. She was sent
to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room for further work-up.
.
Upon arrival to the ER her VS were 97.8 90 129/71 18 90%. She
was found to have worsening R pleural effusion and decreasing O2
saturation on room air. She was given Levofloxacin 750mg IV. Her
DNR/DNI status was confirmed with her and the patient. She was
admitted to the MICU for further work-up and treatment of her
acute on chronic hypoxia.
.
Of note, patient has had multiple admissions for hypoxia. She
was discharged [**2167-11-3**] for long admission due to aspiration
pneumonits and small PE's found after recent hip fracture and
surgery. There also seemed to be an element of CHF at that time
due to being fluid-overloaded on exam and responding well to
lasix.
.
The patient arrived at the MICU on BiPAP mask with O2
saturations in the 80's. Her BP was 109/44. She did not have any
complaints except for the mask bothering her. She again
reiterated not wanting to be intubated.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD s/p MI; PCI to LCx in [**2164**]; most recent stress [**10-8**]
2. CHF, s/p AICD for low EF (30% in [**5-8**]% in [**10-8**]) thought
to be due to systemic sclerosis, most recently 50-55% in [**10-9**]
3. R heart failure according to ECHO in [**10-8**]
4. Severe Pulmonary Hypertension,
5. Systemic Sclerosis with ischemia to L index finger with
osteomyelitis
6. Severe Raynaud's syndome
7. SLE
8. C. Diff diarrhea while on antibiotics multiple times in the
past
9. COPD
10. GERD
11. Occipital Neuralgia
12. h/o SBO/lysis of adhesions
13. h/o meningitis [**3-9**]


Social History:
-- Now living at rehab
-- Married with two children
-- 25 pack year smoking history
Per [**2167-11-5**] Discharge Letter to PCP:
"A family meeting took place on Monday, [**2167-11-2**] with
palliative care, social work, the medicine team, and the
patient's husband and two daughters.  Prognosis and goals of
care were discussed.  They agreed that they would be okay with
a nasogastric tube for feeding and would not like to undergo
the risk of a procedure to place a g-tube or peg-tube.  Their
ultimate goal would be for the patient to return home where she
could spend time with family including her grandchildren whom
she adores greatly.  They hope for improvement in her condition
and her functionality at the rehab.  If significant sustained
progress at a rehab is not appearing likely after a trial of a
several weeks or the patient's condition begins to decline
further, they would likely consider transitioning to
comfort-oriented care at home with hospice."
.
-- Patient had a trial of thickened fluids for PO, but she
didn't like this much and an NG tube was placed for feeds
.

Study Date of [**2167-12-7**] 4:31 AM
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: Bilateral lower lung opacities
appear
slightly increased on the right side. Upper lungs are clear.
There is mild
cephalization of pulmonary vasculature compatible with mild
congestive heart
failure. Heart is enlarged. Aorta is calcified and tortuous. A
left-sided
cardiac pacer with the leads overlying the right atrium and
right ventricle is
stable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Increased bibasilar opacities represent pleural effusion with
adjacent
atelectasis or pneumonia/aspiration.
2. Cardiomegaly and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 yoF w/ complicated pulmonary history (including recent PE,
aspiration pneumonitis, P-HTN and CHF) and dysphagia [**2-2**]
CREST/scleroderma, presenting with acute onset hypoxia while at
rehab. Ultimately unable to protect her airway and continued to
aspirate. Pt and family were adamantly DNR DNI and opposed to
invassive procedures such as feeding tubes. Given her prolonged
and complicated recent hospitalizations and rehab stays, the
patient was made CMO. She expired shortly thereafter.
.
#. HYPOXIA: suspect due to aspiration whether pneumonitis vs.
pneumonia; likley due to esophageal dysmotility in setting of
scleroderma (?CREST is likely). Low suspicion for PE given INR
was 2.3 on coumadin; also did not appear volume overloaded on
exam and had low UOP after lasix 20 mg IV by EMS so likely no
element of failure currently. As noted, Pt adamantly DNR DNI.
Family agreed with this decision. Unable to maintain sat as she
continued to aspirate on the floor. She ultimately went into
respiratory failure from aspiration and expired.
