Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2180-1-13**] Exploratory Laparotomy, Small Bowel Resection, Primary

History of Present Illness:
83 yo female with h/o dCHF, CAD, CKD on HD, HTN, DMII, dementia,
recent admission in [**11-2**] for septic hip and MRSA bacteremia
(currently on vancomycin during HD), who presented to the ED
after completion of her hemodialysis session where she was noted
to have an elevated BP of 208/124 in the setting of an acute on
subacute on chronic decline in mental status as endorsed by her
daughter. The patient was admitted for further evaluation for
her BP.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 98.2 HR 74 BP 188/89 RR 18 O2 100%
on RA. Pt was AAOx2 (not to time) in the ED. Her home BP meds
(Metoprolol and Isosorbide Mononitrate) were given. She became
combative and noncompliant when taking VS so she was then was
given Haldol 2.5mg IV x1. Labs were notable for Trop 0.13 (which
is above her baseline). EKG showed NSR, diffuse T wave
flattening. Repeat EKG was same. She given full dose ASA.
Cardiology stated that her EKG changes are likely [**1-26**] HTN, CKD,
not ACS. Pt's BG was 70-100s range, not hypoglycemic. CXR was
neg. CT head was neg. Pt not producing urine so no UA was sent.
Repeat CEs are pending at time of transfer. VS on transfer were
T 99.1 HR 73 BP 143/92 RR 18 O2 100% on RA.
.
On the floor, the patient found to be very somnolent but
arousable to verbal stimuli. She is unable to recount her
history and was found to be oriented only to person. She
initially endorsed diffuse pain and discomfort, citing that she
does not feel well. She later endorsed pain in both legs that
she localized more to her right hip and knee. She denies any
chest pain, any difficulty breathing, any belly pain. She did
however note occasional discomfort in her backside when
adjusting her position in the bed.

IMAGING:
- [**1-6**] CT abd/pelvis: Partial SBO, no definite transition point
is identified, however, it is most likely in mid to distal small
bowel. The obstruction is likely due to adhesions given the pt's
surgical history. No evidence of bowel strangulation. Small to
mod amt of fluid is identified within the abdomen and pelvis.
Pneumobilia, predominantly in the L liver lobe, new since [**11-2**]
exam. Nephrolithiasis without evidence of obstruction.
- [**1-11**] CT abd/pelvis: progression of small bowel obstruction,
with focal point of transition in the RLQ, with no evidence of
pneumatosis or extraluminal gas. Stable amt of abdominal and
pelvic ascites. Stable pneumobilia in the L hepatic lobe.
Bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 y/o female admitted to Medicine initially for hypertensive
emergency who developed small bowel obstruction, and new onset
atrial fibrillation.

**The following portion of summary were issues/events identified
while on the Medicine Service as dictated per Medical team:
.
# Hypotension: On HD4, patient had an episode of hypotension
related to afib with RVR. Heart rate responded incompletely to
diltiazem and she was transferred to the ICU. On presentation to
the ICU, the patient was hypotensive in context of abdominal
distension and atrial fibrillation.  New a-fib is related to
sympathetic outflow in the context of pain and hypovolemia
related to small bowel obstruction. Gentle fluid boluses were
given as needed. With improved rate control, hypotension
resolved.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: New onset, but in context of
known underlying cardiac disease, likely hypovolemia and stress
of partial SBO. Pt was fluid resuscitated and started on
diltiazem drip. Drip was converted to PO 30mg q6h with good
control.
.
# Complete bowel obstruction: On HD3, patient developed
abdominal distention and pain, that night she began vomiting KUB
showed dilated loops of bowel and an NG tube was placed for SBO.
The tube was maintained to suction x 5 days without significant
diminution in output. Repeat CT scan showed complete small bowel
obstruction with a transition point. Surgery recommended urgent
lysis of adhesions.  A family meeting was held and patient's HCP
[**Name (NI) **] agreed that surgery was in line with goals of care. The
following day patient was transferred to surgery.

On [**1-13**] she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of
adhesion and small bowel resection.  Intraoperatively, she was
noted to have an internal hernia with perforation of the small
bowel. Approximately 1 foot of small bowel was resected and the
abdomen was closed. EBL was approximately 100ml. The pt was
admitted to the TICU intubated and on a neo gtt. She was
persistently hypotensive on POD 0 and was started on vasopressin
gtt. Trop peaked at 0.31, with an unchanged EKG post op. On POD
1, the patient was extubated. She was bolused for hypotension
and tachycardia. Her pressors were weaned off on POD 2. She was
also transfused 1u prbc. On POD 3, the patient was transferred
to the floor in stable condition
