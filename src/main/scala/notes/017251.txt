RADIOLOGY:

[**2154-12-13**]:
CXR - Extensive multifocal patchy consolidations, consistent
with aspiration or pneumonia. Mild congestive heart failure with
a small right pleural effusion.
CT ABD - Severe right hydronephrosis secondary to large
obstructing ureteropelvic junction stone. Two other
non-obstructing right kidney stones are present. Patchy
consolidation in the right lung, concerning for pneumonia.
[**2154-12-14**]:
CXR - Increased interstitial markings in both apices with
clearing of patchy opacity at the right base. While this may
represent congestive failure, the heart is normal in size and
this more likely represents focal infiltrates or aspiration.
IR NEPHROGRAM/NEPHROSTOMY - Antegrade nephrostogram revealed
moderate hydronephrosis with multiple filling defects in the
renal pelvis consistent with one or more stones or clot.
Contrast passes beyond the area of obstruction into the urinary
bladder, where there is a suprapubic catheter present.
Successful placement of an 8 French percutaneous nephrostomy
tube via a right upper pole calyx. The tip of the catheter is
present in the renal pelvis. The catheter was placed to external
bag drainage.
[**2154-12-15**]:
CXR - Since previous exam yesterday morning, there is now
confluent density in the right upper lobe with bilateral pleural
effusions. This suggests aspiration. Patient also appears to be
in failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE @ [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) **]:

1. Sepsis: The patient was admitted to the ICU after receiving
      ceftriaxone and ceftazidime in the emergency department.
He quickly
      became increasingly hypotensive and a groin line was
placed in the left
      femoral artery.  Overnight physician notes an art stick
occurred while
      attempting to place femoral catheter in the right groin.
There were no
      hematomas noted.
      After IV access was obtained, the patient was started on
Levophed for
      pressure support.  He also received aggressive fluid
resuscitation  with
      a total of 4 liters of IV fluids.  The patient was
continued on
      ceftazidime for IV antibiotics.  ID consult was obtained
and agreed with
      this for now pending further culture data.  The patient's
temperature
      curve continued to go down, however, repeat white count
was 22,000.
2. UTI: Due to the likelihood that UTI was the source of his
bacteremia,
      urologic consultation was obtained. The suprapubic
catheter was flushed
      and irrigated easily.  Abdominal ultrasound was obtained,
which reveals
      marked right hydronephrosis. Initial plan after speaking
with in town
      urology was to proceed with CT to assess for level of
obstruction.
      However, once Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 391**] could be reached, given the
patient's  poor
      respiratory status and DNR/DNI status, a decision was made
to transfer
      into [**Location (un) 86**] for IR placement of percutaneous drain to
drain infection
      and to avoid CT scan at this point. This was discussed
with the
      patient's family and they were in agreement with the plan.
3. Respiratory status: The patient, after aggressive fluid
      resuscitation, chest x-ray shows some mild pulmonary
edema. He continues
      to sat well with a face mask of oxygen on 10 liters of the
Venti-mask.
      His volume status should be watched closely as he is
DNR/DNI.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is
1.1. On
      admission labs, his creatinine was 1.4 and the following
morning,
      remains elevated at 1.5. There is concern for development
of ATN (acute
      tubular necrosis) due to an hour or so of hypotension.
However, the
      patient remains with good urine output at this point.
5.  FEN (fluids, electrolytes, nutrition): Due the patient's
poor
      mental status, NG tube was placed to provide PO
medications. Tube feeds
      have not been begun and he has remained NPO. His
electrolytes have been
      repleted.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE @ [**Hospital1 18**]:

Pt admitted to MICU on [**2154-12-13**] with urosepsis secondary to
urinary obstruction, hypotension requiring pressors, aspiration
pneumonia, & coagulopathy.  Pt was continued on broad spectrum
antibiotics, received fluids & pressors for hypotension,
transfusion of blood products for coagulopathy, had central
venous line placed, and IR placement of nephrostomy tube to
relieve urinary obstruction.  On [**2154-12-15**], the MICU team met
with the pt's family & PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] aggressive treatment, there
had been no significant improvement in pt's condition, at this
time the family decided to change treatment to comfort measures
only (CMO), discontinuing pressors & aggressive treatment
although continuing with antibiotics.  Pt transferred to the
medicine wards on [**2154-12-16**] with CMO, d/c'ing antibiotics & IVF,
morphine boluses prn.  Pt continued to become more unresponsive
over the next couple days.  Discussed option of home hospice
with family, but it had been pt's desire to remain in hospital.
Pt expired & was pronounced dead on [**2154-12-21**] at 0920.  Pt's
family declined autopsy & made arrangements for body to be
donated to the medical school per pt's wishes.
