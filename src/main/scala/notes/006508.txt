HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 107446**] is an 85-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for
hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well
as diverticular disease who presented to the Emergency
Department with syncope and supraventricular tachycardia, as
well as progressive abdominal tenderness.  Of note, is that
the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 1760**] after being admitted for a
subarachnoid hemorrhage after a fall.  She was also
readmitted earlier in [**Month (only) 404**] for a fall at the
rehabilitation center and then sent back.  Prior to
admission, the patient was apparently having diarrhea and
emesis.  She had a KUB performed at the rehabilitation
facility.  She has also been having decreased oral intake and
decreased appetite.

On the night prior to admission, the patient was found
nonverbal, on the floor.  She was found to be tachycardic to
120/130s with systolic blood pressure of approximately 100
per report.  Consequently, the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital6 256**] where she was found to
be in supraventricular tachycardia and a heart rate in the
160s.  The heart rate was broken with some beta-blocker and
fluid repletion.  In addition, in the Emergency Room, the
patient was noted to be significantly hypertensive to low
200s systolic blood pressure.  She was also noted to be
having progressive abdominal tenderness with peritoneal
signs.  A CT of the abdomen and chest performed on [**2158-12-26**] showed extensive wall thickening and probable
pneumatosis coli of the distal jejunum, highly suspicious for
ischemic bowel.  There was no evidence of free air in the
abdomen to suggest perforation.  In addition, a large
periaortic enhancing mass was noted with central
calcification.  The patient was consequently admitted to
General Surgery for further management.

periumbilical lower abdominal tenderness, peritoneal signs.

well-perfused.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count
24.9, hematocrit 45.2, platelet count 332,000.  Sodium 139,
potassium 3.1, BUN 30, creatinine 1.0, glucose 169.  Troponin
less than 0.3.  Creatinine kinase 41.  Urinalysis showed no
signs of urinary tract infection.  Electrocardiogram showed
supraventricular tachycardia, no ST changes.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a CAT scan of
the abdomen and chest which showed a large periaortic
enhancing mass with central calcification.  In addition,
extensive wall thickening and probable pneumatosis coli of
the distal jejunum was noted which was highly suspicious for
ischemic bowel.  In light of the CT findings, as well as
supraventricular tachycardia and physical examination, the
decision was made to proceed to the Operating Room for a
surgical intervention.  The decision was discussed with the
family and consent was obtained.

On [**2158-12-26**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room and underwent exploratory laparotomy, reduction of the
internal hernia, segmental enterectomy. end-to-end
anastomosis, as well as sharp wedge biopsy of the
retroperitoneal mass seen on the CAT scan.  Blood loss was
less than 100 cc.  The patient received approximately 5000 cc
of fluid.  There were no complications.  Please see the full
operative report for details.  The small bowel and the
retroperitoneal biopsy were sent to the Pathology Department.
The patient remained intubated and was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit in fair condition. She was resuscitated
with intravenous fluids.  She remained tachycardic.  Her
heart rate was controlled with a diltiazem drip.  Pulmonary
toilet was initiated.  She still demonstrated metabolic
acidosis by blood gas.  She was placed on Flagyl.  The
pulmonary artery catheter was placed at the time.

The patient continued to be very lethargic.  She was afebrile
postoperatively.  Her blood gas showed some improvement
postoperatively.  Her hematocrit remained stable and her
white blood cell count remained elevated.  Ciprofloxacin was
added to her regimen.  In addition, she was placed on a
beta-blocker.  An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2158-12-28**] which showed an ejection fraction of 60%.  The
nasogastric tube appeared to be functioning properly.  On
[**2158-12-28**], after discussion with the family, the
patient was made "Do Not Resuscitate" and "Do Not Intubate."
The patient continued to have persistent significant
requirement for fluid and a fixed metabolic acidosis, which
was concerning for continued bowel ischemia.

The patient was consequently taken back to the Operating Room
on [**2158-12-29**].  She again underwent segmental
enterectomy including the anastomosis, as well as resection
partial enterostomy with secondary necessary to resect the
Ileo right colon with a jejunal colic.  The blood loss was
less than 100 cc.  The perioperative course was significant
for hypotension and decreased urine output.  The patient
remained intubated and was transferred back to the Intensive
Care Unit.  Please see the full operative note for details.
Her postoperative course was significant for decreased urine
output, as well as increasing requirement for ventilator
support.  Her urine output picked up slightly.  The patient
was started on trans-parental nutrition.  She was given fresh
frozen plasma for an INR of 2.0.  She remained to have large
base excess on the blood gas.  Blood cultures obtained on
[**2159-1-5**] grew coagulase positive Staph aureus.  Her
white blood cell count remained elevated.  She was eventually
switched to CPAP.  She continued to have low cardiac index
and cardiac output.  An echocardiogram was repeated on
[**2159-1-3**] which again showed an ejection fraction of
at least 60%.

On postoperative day eight and five, the patient was
transferred with one unit of packed red blood cells.  The
patient was also noted to have melena and assumed to have
gastrointestinal bleed, likely lower gastrointestinal bleed.
She continued to be intubated.  She was treated with
Captopril for after load reduction.  The patient was also
started on tube feedings.  The ventilator was changed to
SIMV.  The patient was maintained on ampicillin for positive
blood cultures.  She remained afebrile with stable blood
pressure.

The patient continued to show no significant improvement.
Her creatinine was noted to be rising as well.  A Dop-off
tube was placed for tube feedings.  Another discussion with
the family took place.  The decision was made to extubate the
patient and transfer the patient to the regular floor.  The
patient was consequently made comfort measures only.  The
patient continued to receive respiratory care on the floor.
She was given some intravenous albumin.  After being made
comfort measures only, the patient's TPN was discontinued and
the
