History of Present Illness:
71 year old female w/ diabetes, htn, on ASA/plavix p/w
experssive aphasia x 2-3 days brought back by EMS after being
signed out AMA earlier today. earlier today she had been
evaluated for aphasia which neurology thought at that time not
to be an acute neurological problem. However patient was found
to be hyperglycemic to FSBG 440. She has had similar
presentations in the past, seen by neuro and attributed to
hyperglycemic episodes. Now, pt states her speech is more
garbled than normal and her daughter also noticed the same over
the telephone. Denies HA, cp/sob, numbness, weakness, tingling,
gait problems or other symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 99.4 108 124/46 22 99%.  Physical
exam showed no clear neuro deficits and patient had a
fluctuating level of consciousness.  Labs were significant for a
glucose of 705 and 136/4.4/99/17/31/1.1
.
Seen earlier today for expressive aphasia by neurology who felt
unlikely to be stroke.  Hyperglycemia with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
consciousness but she left AMA.  Now BS 700's with AG.  No
insight into medical condition currently.  8 SC regular insulin
and then on insulin drip.  Clear CXR.  No other symptoms.  Given
2L IVF.

Pertinent Results:
Images:
.
[**2131-9-23**] CTA Head/neck: No hemorrhage large territorial infarct or
acute process on non-contrast scan.  Small vessel ischemic
changes. CTA and perfusion imaging in progress.

[**2131-9-23**] CT head w/o contrast: No acute intracranial process.

[**2131-9-23**] CXR: Limited study with low lung volumes, but otherwise
no acute pulmonary process noted.

EKG:  NSR, poor R wave progression

TTE [**2131-9-25**] The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is moderate
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no left
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 y/o F w/ CAD, HTN, TIA, HLD presenting to ED w/ AMS and
glucose of 704 and found to be in DKA.

#DKA: On presentation to the ED, FSBG 705 with 40 ketones/1000
glucose in urine. She was admitted to the ICU where she was
aggressively given IVF for hypovolemia, repleted with potassium,
and contiued on insulin drip + dextrose until her anion gap was
within normal limits at which time the patient was given her
usual basal dose of 15U humalog and put onto lantus sliding
scale. She was transferred to the floor where she seen by
[**Hospital1 **] physicians who helped in adjusting her sliding scale.
After one day on the floor her BS were under better control. She
no longer had a gap and was tolerating PO.

It is unknown what the percipiting event for this patient's DKA
was. CXR clear, WBC wnl, U/A clean. LFTs/trop/lipase
unremarkable. Now with leukocytosis this AM and low grade fever,
but still no clear source of infection.  Patient endorses full
compliance with home insulin regimen. After discharge, it was
noted on her Microbiology results that she had 10,000 GPC in
her urine culture.  Her UA was  negative for infection
