Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old white male
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with a history of a recent
fall late on the evening of the [**2-2**], at which
time he landed on the back of his head with a report of a
loss of consciousness for an unknown period of time.  The
patient reported that he awoke and noted he was still at home
and others took him to the Emergency Room.  At the [**Hospital3 9683**], a CT scan was positive for a small subacute right
sided frontal parietal subdural hematoma with layered blood
posteriorly, which was felt to be new since the prior CT scan
done after a fall on [**2126-11-4**].  The patient was
therefore transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for further Neurosurgical assessment and a plan.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Recent history of falls.
2.  History of unstable angina in the past.
3.  History of chronic atrial fibrillation.
4.  History of a transient ischemic attack in [**2118**].
5.  History of peptic ulcer disease.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
8.  History of seizure disorder status post an motor vehicle
accident in [**2119**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of three-vessel coronary artery disease status
post stent in [**2118**].
2.  Bilateral carotid endarterectomies in [**2118**].
3.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2118**].
4.  Transurethral resection of the prostate in [**2117**].
5.  Status post subdural hematoma secondary to motor vehicle
accident in [**2119**].  This reportedly was never evacuated and
after which he developed a seizure disorder.

ALLERGIES:   He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 1 p.o. q. day.
2.  Dilantin 100 mg p.o. three times a day.
3.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Zocor 20 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Coumadin, which was discontinued after the fall,[**2128**]8 hours
prior to admission.
7.  Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
8.  Sotalol 80 mg p.o. twice a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He reports he quit tobacco smoking 20 years
prior to admission.  He denies the use of alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, he was an
elderly appearing white male seen while supine in bed, awake,
alert, confused, but knows his name and knew the day's date
but did not know the place or follow any simple commands very
well.  He had a positive left upper extremity drift and the
pupils were equal, round and reactive to light and
accommodation.  His extraocular movements are intact.
Peripheral field examination was inconsistent.  He moved all
extremities.  Strength was five over five in all groups.
There was a mild left pronator drift.  The sensory
examination was intact but limited secondary to poor patient
compliance.  On deep tendon reflexes the patient was tense in
all extremities and reflexes were unable to be obtained at
the time of examination due to increased tone.  Plantar
responses were downgoing weakly bilaterally.  The neck was
supple without nodes or adenopathy.  The lungs were clear.
The heart showed an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm
consistent with atrial fibrillation.  Abdominal examination
was soft and nontender, nondistended, and bowel sounds were
present in all four quadrants.  Extremities were without
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  He was transferred to the
hospital with Venodyne on, so the Venodyne were present at
the time of examination.

LABORATORY:  Review of the [**Hospital3 **] CT scan dated the
[**11-2**] revealed a subacute subdural hematoma of the
right frontal parietal area measuring approximately 2.1 cm
thick and approximately 6.0 cm long, along the right frontal
parietal area with a slight midline shift and preservation of
the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction and moderate widening and prominent
sulci on the left, which was consistent with long-standing
brain atrophy.

Coagulation studies at [**Hospital3 **] at 07:55 a.m. on the
[**2126-12-4**], were reported as a PT of 21, PTT 31.6
and an INR of 2.86.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the clinical findings, the patient
was admitted to the hospital Neurosurgical Intensive Care
Unit and arrangements were made for INR to be corrected with
fresh frozen plasma urgently, with a goal to get the INR
below 1.3.  A repeat CT scan was scheduled for the morning
and the patient was admitted to the hospital Neurosurgical
Intensive Care Unit.

Upon review with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6910**], on the following day the
patient was felt to have a subdural hematoma with indication
for evacuation of the clot and due to the findings, the
patient was taken to the Operating Room where the patient
underwent a bur-hole drainage of the subdural hematoma with
placement of a subdural drain.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was returned to the Neurosurgical
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

The patient's neurologic status improved moderately.  He
still showed evidence of occasional confusion.  Physical
examination was otherwise unchanged and the subdural drains
were removed on the second postoperative day after adequate
drainage and repeat CT scans confirmed a reasonably good
drainage.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the Floor,
however, due to an episode of respiratory distress while out
on the Medical-Surgical Floor, the patient was urgently
re-intubated and readmitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive
Care Unit.  He was suctioned aggressively and found to have
multiple mucous plugs and tolerated this well.  A chest x-ray
was obtained which showed a small pneumothorax.  A chest tube
was placed by the Cardiothoracic Service and he was followed
in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit for several more
days.  The chest tube was subsequently removed.

The patient was returned again to the Medical-Surgical Floor
and did well for several days.  He was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital **] Hospital on
[**2127-1-3**], with follow-up to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6910**] in the
Clinic in several weeks' time.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Stable and improved.

DISPOSITION:   Discharge to the [**Hospital1 700**]
for aggressive Physical Therapy and Occupational [**Hospital **]
rehabilitation services as an inpatient.
