History of Present Illness:
76 year old female resident of [**Location **] Reb, with h/o of bladder
carcinoma, DVT in left upper extremity, hyperlipidemia, HTN and
angina who was initially admitted with 3 days of abdominal pain

.
CT abd: There has been interval development of a short focal
segment of mild bowel wall thickening involving the sigmoid
colon with subtle adjacent fatty stranding. Note is also made of
a few surgical clips in the deep pelvis adjacent to the bladder,
which have been placed in the interval. There is no free air or
free fluid. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is
appreciated.
.
CXR: Tip of right jugular CV line is in region of cavoatrial
junction. No pneumothorax. There is cardiomegaly and pulmonary
vascular engorgement, consistent with CHF/fluid overload. In
addition, there are bibasilar atelectases. The stability of
associated consolidation in the left lower lobe cannot be ruled
out.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) leukocytosis/UTI/?colitis: The patient was admitted to
internal medicine for evaluation and treatment of her UTI and
her ?colitis seen on her CT abdomen.  The patient was evaluated
by the surgical service, who was concerned that the inflammation
around the colon could be infectious, and recommended antibiotic
coverage to include diverticulitis and c. diff colitis.  The
possibility remains, however, that the bowel wall thickening is
merely a post-operative and post-XRT change from her bladder
cancer.  The patient was initially treated with
Vanco/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl, and saw little improvement in her
symptoms.  Her urine culture from [**8-7**] then came back growing
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa sensitive to ceftazidime as well as
enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.  She was continued on
flagyl as well for concern for intraabdominal process.  The
patient experienced diarrhea, which was sent for stool studies,
including c. diff, all negative.

MICU TRANSFER:
On the morning of [**8-16**], the patient was noted to have a WBC jump
from 24 to 30, with low systolic pressure down to 80s-90s, as
well as hypoxia at 88% on 3L (increased from her baseline of
2L), necessitating NRB. A lactate was 4.2. She was started on
levophed and wide open fluids and transferred to the MICU.

On arrival in the MICU she was hypothermic (T 92.4), with MAPs
in the 70s on levophed. She was placed on BiPap 10/5 with 80%
FiO2, but ABG was 7.3/34/112 - A-a gradient 275. A CXR showed
worsening CHF and persistent LLL opacity. She was
semi-electively intubated in anticipation of fluid requirements
for hypotension in the face of a presumed failing heart with
pulmonary edema and cold, clammy extremities. She had a L
subclavian central line placed.  Her antibiotics were broadened
to include tobramycin and caspofungin per ID recommendations.
She had an abdominal x-ray which showed a vague increased
density over the bladder of unclear significance, without
apparent free air or obstruction.  Surgery was following,
however felt the patient was too unstable to be taken to the OR
for laparotomy given her pressor requirement.

She was aggressively hydrated, but despite this, had increasing
pressor requirements.  Given her CHF and cold extremities, as
well as known RV failure, there was concern for a cardiogenic
source of her shock.  A stat echo showed normal LV function with
marked dilitation of the right ventricular cavity as well as
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis and 4+ TR.
 PE was considered, however the patient was too unstable to have
a CTA, and the echo result was not significantly changed from
prior echo subsequent to which a CTA had been negative for PE.
Her pressor requirement gradually escalated over the course of 8
or so hours, until she was maxed out on 4 pressors with fluids
running wide open.  In this setting, her HR and BP continued to
trend down, and attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation in
this setting were deemed futile.  She expired at 12:25 a.m. with
her husband at the bedside, in no apparent pain.

2) CHF: Per report, the patient had been treated with Lasix 80mg
PO daily until recently, when her low blood pressures became
prohibitive.  The patient had bibasilar crackles in the ED, and
was given Lasix 40mg IV x1 with good urine output response.
However, the patient subsequently became hypotensive and
required 250cc boluses x3 with improvement to BPs of 90s over
palp.  The patient's blood pressures remained low throughout her
stay, and her CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.  It was
decided that a blood transfusion would improve bother her anemia
as well as her intravascular volume status, and so a transfusion
on 1u PRBC was given, with improvement of SBP to the low 100s.
Per previous echocardiogram reports, the patient
