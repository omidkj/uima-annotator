Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4588**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77230**] is an 87F with a PMH s/f CHF with an EF of 30%, A fib
s/p pacemaker not anticoagulated, on home O2 who presented on
[**2193-8-24**] after developing acute onset of shortness of breath
with a new O2 requirement (her baseline is 92% on 2L, and she
was requiring 6L NC to maintain sats).  Otherwise her ROS was
negative.  She ruled out for an MI by enzymes.  The team
attempted to diurese her for a presumed CHF exacerbation based
on her CXR findings of cephalization and pleural effusions, they
anticoagulated her for suspicion for a PE and a chads score of
4, and put her in for an echo and CTA of the chest.  Initially
her hemodynamics improved with diuresis, with a decrease in her
creatinine, so the team attempted further diuresis today.  She
has recieved a total of 160mg of IV lasix, and has put out
approximately 1100cc of urine.
Today the patient was noted to drop her sats to 70s on room air
whenever she would take her face mask off.  She was in no acute
respiratory distress, and was mentating well with this.  An ABG
was obtained which showed 7.44/41/48.  She was taken down for a
STAT CTA, and transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77230**] is an 87F with a PMH s/f chronic systolic HF (EF
30%), afib off coumadin, with baseline home O2 requirement who
presents with acute worsening of dyspnea and new oxygen
requirement.

1)Respiratory distress: Likely CHF exacerbation given Chest
X-ray findings. She is normally on 2L of O2 at home, which
increased to 6L during her hospital stay. She received 160mg IV
Lasix on the floor with 2L of urine output. In the MICU, she
received an additional 80mg IV. Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Her oxygen requirements continued to improve with diuresis. On
the day of discharge, she was at baseline of 2 liters and
satting at 90-91%. She had been adequately diuresed and it was
felt that low baseline saturations were likely secondary to
bibasilar atelectasis as identified on Chest CT. Her home Lasix
dose was increased and she was discharged on 60mg PO BID, (vs
40mg PO BID on admission). Clinically she appeared euvolemic at
the time of discharge. Discharged with instruction to encourage
ambulation, incentive spirometry to improve air movement.

2)Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.3-1.5; elevated
to 2.0 on admission.
Her Cr was monitored closely and her medications were renally
dosed. Her creatinine stabilized at 1.7 and it was felt that
this liekly represents new baseline creatinine for her.

3)Chronic systolic/diastolic heart failure: Patient was diuresed
as above. Losartan was held in light of elevated creatinine, but
restarted prior to discharge. She was continued on beta-blocker.
ECHO showed improvement of global systolic function with EF of
50-55%, improved from [**2193-1-10**] Echo with 30% EF.

4)HTN: She was continued on home regimen of Amlodipine and
Metoprolol.

5)Atrial fibrillation: s/p pacemaker. She is not on
anticoagulation as an outpatient. She was continued on
beta-blocker for rate control. Her outpatient PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 15303**]
rehab was contact[**Name (NI) **] and it was recommended that anticoagulation
be initiated for atrial fibrillation.He will investigate why
this was not previosuly done and consider starting. No
anticoagulation was started while inpatient.

6)Dementia: Continued on Aricept and Namenda.

7)Hypothyroidism: Continued on Levothyroxine.

8)DM type II: Patient is on Glipizide as outpatient; this was
held in light of her acute renal failure. She was placed on an
insulin sliding scale with good blood sugar control. Prior to
discharge, glipizide was restarted at home dose.

9)Gout: Continued on Allopurinol which was renally dosed.

10)Depression: Continued on Paxil.
