APC ablation of granulation tissue in the trachea and
tracheostomy stoma revision/dilatation with trach upgrade to #7


History of Present Illness:
58 year old female with history of COPD, OSA, Pulmonary HTN
admitted to MICU service  at [**Hospital1 3278**] for bronchoscopy evaluation.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital6 **] on
[**2122-2-16**] in Respiratory failure. She was intubated in the ED and
was difficult to wean leading to a trach and PEG being placed
during that admission.  She also developed abdominal distention
and was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia. She had
part of a colon resected in a colostomy and rectal pouch
performed.  During the admission, she became septic and
developed
ATN requiring HD.  She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital3 33538**] for rehabilitation where  she was weaned off HD and her
dependence on the Ventilator. Over the past couple of weeks, the
patient noted feeling like something was stuck in her throat as
well as increased difficulty breathing. She was also noted to
have increased yellow and bloody secretions from her trach site.

The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 3278**] for
Bronchoscopy to further eval her trach site. After being
evaluated it was found that she had severe TBM and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and Y stent placement.

On Admission: tach Portex #6

Brief Hospital Course:
58 F transferred from [**Hospital1 3278**] with Severe TBM, OSA for placement
of Y stent by Interventional Pulmonary.

Admitted to SICU and underwent bronch which demonstrated mild
tracheal
stenosis w/ moderate amount of granulation tissue noted at the
site of the stoma. The mid portion of the trachea was noted to
have severe tracheomalacia with greater
than 95% occlusion during exhalation. The distal trachea had
mild tracheomalacia, approximately 65%. The right main stem
bronchus had mild bronchomalacia at about 65%. Bronchus
intermedius was noted to have moderate bronchomalacia estimated
at about 80%. The left main stem bronchus was noted to have
moderate bronchomalacia estimated at approximately 80%
occlusion.

She was taken to the OR on [**2122-7-24**] and underwent rigid [**Last Name (un) 1066**] with
microdebrider to granulation tissue and APC to coaggulate
bleeding.  Her tracheostomy stoma was then dilated with a Blue
Rhino and a new tracheostomy, a Portex size #7, was inserted.

She did well post operatively and will be transferred back to
rehab [**2122-7-25**].

Will need to continue PPI [**Hospital1 **] and ranitidine qhs for GERD and
complete 8 days of zosyn for VAP.

She is scheduled for follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
Interventional pulmonary in 2 weeks.  She is planned to undergo
Rigid Bronch with stoma revision and T-tube placement then.
