History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 39752**] is an 80 year old female well known to the cardiac
surgery service s/p coronary artery bypass grafting times one
with reverse saphenous vein to the right coronary artery, aortic
valve replacement, [**Street Address(2) 17167**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical BioCore tissue valve
on [**2160-7-10**] with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see her discharge
summary for further details of her hospital course postop. On
[**2160-7-15**] she was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. She
presented to the emergency department of [**Hospital1 827**] complaining of chest pain and her family reported
altered mental status. Her chest pain was determined to be
sternal incisional discomfort, as it was reliably reproducible.
Her ECG was normal. She was started on antibiotics for a urinary
tract infection.  While in the emergency department she became
hypotensive. She was fluid resucitated and required pressor
support and was therefore admitted to the cardiac surgery
intensive care unit.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A prominent
Chiari network is present (normal variant).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move normally. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion. Effusion
echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No RA or RV diastolic collapse.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal image quality -
patient unable to cooperate. Emergency study performed by the
cardiology fellow on call.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
inferior wall and mid inferolateral walls. There is normal
contraction of the remaining segments (overall LVEF 55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is well-seated and the
aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The
gradients across the aortic valve are not well assessed. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. Overlying the
right ventricle, the effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. No right atrial
or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

IMPRESSION: Overall normal left ventricular systolic function
with inferior wall/inferolateral hypokinesis, as described.
Well-seated bioprothetic aortic valve without aortic
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Small to
moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
