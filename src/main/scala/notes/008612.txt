Date of Birth:  [**2114-1-7**]        Sex:  F

Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old
woman with past medical history significant for end-stage
renal disease and poorly controlled hypertension who was
brought in to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department by EMS after her husband activated 911
due to her lethargy and decreased responsiveness.  Of note,
the patient has had multiple admissions to the same facility
over the prior year for uncontrolled hypertension and
associated chest pain without evidence of myocardial
ischemia, all in the setting of poor medicine compliance and
missed dialysis sessions.  On history, the patient reports
missing approximately two weeks worth of hemodialysis
appointments after her most recent infected Tunneled catheter
was removed.  The patient reported feeling both tired and
depressed, expressing suicidal ideations, and admitted
refusal of dialysis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise significant for the absence of
chest pain or cough, but presence of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea over the week leading to admission.  The patient
denied headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, significant
for multiple tunneled catheter dialysis infections.

Hypertension.

Hepatitis C.

Polysubstance abuse.

Asthma.

History of left-sided CVA with residual right-sided weakness.

Bilateral internal jugular clots in [**5-6**].

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN, KEFZOL, CODEINE, and VANCOMYCIN.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Bumex 2 mg b.i.d.
2. Enalapril 40 mg q.d.
3. Labetalol 600 mg b.i.d.
4. Clonidine 0.3 mg TTP patch.
5. Norvasc 10 mg q.d.
6. Iron sulfate supplements.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2 degrees, blood
pressure 164/104, heart rate 100 to 110, respiratory rate 16,
saturating 97 percent on room air.  In general, tearful and
angry appearing woman, responding to questions, and in no
acute distress.  HEENT exam:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Sclarea anicteric.  Chest is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac without murmur.
Abdomen:  Soft and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No pedal edema, fistula, left antecubital fossa
with palpable thrill.  Neuro:  Alert and oriented to person,
place, month, and year.  Following commands.  Moving all
extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission, sodium 141, potassium
5.8, chloride 114, bicarbonate 11, BUN 107, creatinine 10.6,
glucose 115, calcium 7.7, magnesium 2.2, and phosphorous 7.8.
CBC, white blood cell count 8.7, hematocrit 36.5, and
platelets 277.  Coags within normal limits.  Chest x-ray,
cardiomegaly with mild vascular congestion.  EKG, normal
sinus rhythm of 90, LVH, and left atrial enlargement.  CT of
the head is significant for right thalamic hypodense lesion,
new compared with prior study of [**3-6**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hypertensive urgency.  The
patient was placed on Nipride drip in the emergency
department to which she responded well.  Her outpatient
medications including labetalol, Enalapril, and Norvasc were
reinitiated given her recent noncompliance with these
medications.  Additionally, a Catapres patch was placed on
the patient.  Given her fluid overload secondary to dialysis
noncompliance, plans were made to initiate hemodialysis after
appropriate access was placed.  The patient was maintained on
Nipride drip upon transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
and throughout her three to four day hospital course was
placed back on her outpatient regimen with the Nipride drip
being weaned off during her second day of Medical Intensive
Care Unit stay.

End stage renal disease.  Interventional Radiology was
consulted from the emergency department to establish access
for hemodialysis.  The patient initially refused such
intervention, but ultimately consented to such on the evening
of admission.  The renal consult team was asked to see the
patient in the emergency department and managed her end-stage
renal disease throughout her hospital course, receiving
several rounds of hemodialysis prior to discharge.  The
patient's outpatient nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**], evaluated the
patient on a daily basis in the Medical Intensive Care Unit
and contributed to her care.

Psychiatry.  The patient expressed suicidal ideations and all
her statements that indicated her noncompliance with
medications and hemodialysis were secondary to her
depression.  The psychiatry consult team evaluated the
patient in the emergency department and consulted during her
Medical Intensive Care Unit stay and deemed her competent to
make decisions regarding her own care and not an acute risk
to herself or others.

Neurology.  Given the above-mentioned CT findings, the
Neurology Stroke Consult Service was consulted and felt that
the findings seen on CT were consistent with small-vessel
disease resulting in a lacunar infarct.  Given the patient's
nonfocal neurology exam, recommendations were made to control
the patient's blood pressure adequately and start the patient
on one daily aspirin.  Further lifestyle modifications,
specifically that regarding recreational drug abuse and
tobacco use were recommended as well as testing a baseline
lipid panel, which was pending at the time of discharge.

Lymphadenopathy.  During her Medical Intensive Care Unit
stay, the patient was noted to have a tender left
submandibular lymph node approximately 1 cm to 2 cm in size
without evidence of pharyngitis or other oropharyngeal
lesions.  In light of this, an HIV test was sent and was
pending at the time of discharge; and the patient was
instructed to followup with her primary care physician
regarding the persistence of such a lesion.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  End-stage renal disease.

Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Enalapril 10 mg 4 tablets p.o. q.d.
