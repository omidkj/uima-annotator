Brief Hospital Course:
[**2106-9-24**]: On arrival to the ED, the patient had gross proptosis
and a large hematoma surrounding his left eye. A left lateral
canthotomy was performed to release any blood/pressure in the
retrobulbar space. The patient was taken to CT scan for further
analysis of his head, c-spine, abdomen and pelvis. He was
transferred to the trauma SICU for overnight observation and
management.

[**2106-9-25**] to [**2106-9-30**]: Patient was successfully extubated and
transferred to the floor. His head/face CT revealed a left
orbital floor fracture extending into the inferior aspect of the
medial wall, but with no muscular entrapment. The patient had no
other injuries other than those to his face. The patient did
well on the floor and will be taken to the operating room by the
plastics team next week for ORIF, titanium mesh placement of the
patient's left oribtal floor fx. The patient will return to his
facility in the interim until surgery. At the time of discharge
he was tolerating PO and his pain well controlled on oral pain
medication.
