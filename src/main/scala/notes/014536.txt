Date of Birth:   [**2052-7-20**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old woman
with mitral valve disease diagnosed in [**2106-10-12**].  At
that time, she presented to her primary care physician with
fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, dizziness.  She has noticed
that her quality of life has become significantly impacted
over the ensuing months.  An initial echocardiogram revealed
an ejection fraction greater than 60% with 3+ mitral
regurgitation.

Her review of symptoms is negative for claudication,
orthopnea, and pedal edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mitral valve disease, as described above.
2.  Borderline hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Denied history of hypertension, diabetes, or coronary
artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Denied.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father passed away at age 78
of a MI.  The patient's mother has a history of diabetes.
One brother has asthma.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with adult children.
She denied the use or abuse of alcohol or tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient is status
post cardiac catheterization and looks well and is in no
distress.  Vital signs:  Heart rate 56, blood pressure
106/60.   HEENT:  Extraocular muscles were intact.  The
oropharynx was without lesions.  Neck:  Supple and soft with
no bruits or JVD.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without appreciable murmur.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended without organomegaly.
Extremities:  Without edema, warm and well perfuse.  Pulses:
She has symmetrical and strong pulses at the carotids,
radials, femorals, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial
arteries.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram performed on
[**2106-11-26**] revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 60 and
3+ mitral regurgitation.  She had normal atrium and
ventricles and a normal aorta.

Cardiac catheterization performed on [**2107-2-21**]
revealed a wedge pressure of 10, left dominant normal
coronaries, 2+ mitral regurgitation with prolapse and an
ejection fraction of 65%.

Her EKG is unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats
per minute.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 44944**] was admitted to the [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2107-2-28**].  On the
day of admission she underwent a right thoracotomy and
minimally invasive mitral valve repair and annuloplasty.
This was performed with a #26 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] band.  The
procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and assisted
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] .................... .  The procedure was
performed with a total bypass time of 134 minutes and cross
clamp time of 106 minutes.

The procedure was complicated by [**Male First Name (un) **] after the repair.  This
condition was reversed by the administration of volume and
rate control.  The procedure was without complications.
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more
details.

The patient was transferred from the Operating Room to the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit intubated and in stable
condition.

The remainder of Mrs.[**Hospital 44945**] hospital course was
relatively unremarkable.  In the Cardiac Surgery ICU, she was
extubated on postoperative day number one and weaned from all
vasoactive drips.  Initially, she was in a high junctional
rhythm which precluded the administration of beta blockers to
treat her [**Male First Name (un) **]; however, by postoperative day number two, she
had reverted into normal sinus rhythm and low-dose beta
blockade was established.

By postoperative day number three, she was stable and ready
to be transferred to Regular Patient Care floor.  It was
noted that in the process of administering a twice daily dose
of Lopressor and diuresis with Lasix, she had marginal blood
pressures in the 80s systolic.  Although she was without
symptoms, the decision was made to decrease the extent of her
beta blockade.

On postoperative day number five, she was stabilized on all
cardiovascular medications.  She was ambulating to a level V,
tolerating p.o. and had excellent pain control.  She is ready
to be discharged to home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 44944**] looks well
and has a bright affect.  Vital signs:  Her temperature is
98.7, heart rate 76 and in sinus rhythm, blood pressure
110/74, breathing 20 per minute and saturating 96% on room
air.  General:  She is comfortable.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  She has a well healing right
thoracotomy wound without any evidence of erythema or
infection.  Heart:  Regular.  There is trace pedal edema.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Mitral regurgitation.
2.  Congestive heart failure, status post mitral valve repair
and annuloplasty.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. while taking Lasix.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
pain.
6.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. while taking Percocet.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] in three to six weeks.  She should call his office to
arrange an appointment.

The patient needs to follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 437**], in the coming week.
