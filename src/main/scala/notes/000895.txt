ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Although the patient was initially slated
for discharge to rehabilitation facility on [**2186-7-7**],
subsequent evaluations by physical therapy suggested the
patient would be a suitable candidate for discharge to home
following resolution of his acute medical issues.  The
patient was therefore scheduled for discharge to home with
VNA services; however, his discharge was again delayed
secondary to the fact that the patient did not have a
preexisting relationship with a primary care physician or
cardiologist who could provide adequate supervision of his
Coumadin therapy on an outpatient basis.  The patient
therefore remained in house through [**2186-7-11**], at which point
he was cleared for discharge to home with services and
instructions for follow-up.
