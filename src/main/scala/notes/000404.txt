Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 25383**] was initially admitted to the MICU given concern for
her tachypnea and tachycardia.  She was treated for pneumonia
with levofloxacin and for COPD with steroids and nebulizers.
Her oxygen saturations remained in the high 90s with 3L
supplemental oxygen.  Her chest-xray did not show consolidation.
 She tested negative for legionella urinary antigen and was
negative for flu.  She was transferred to a regular medical
floor on the second day of her hospitalization.  Her warfarin
for her knee replacement was held when her INR became
supratherapeutic >5 in the setting of antibiotic use.

On the floor, the following issues were managed:
# Respiratory distress. Patient was treated for CAP/HAP with
levoquin and discharged to complete a 7 day course. CXR on
admission showed hyperinflation without focal findings and
repeat showed now interval change.  No sputum culture to guide
therapy.  She was also treated for COPD flare/bronchitis with
burst of prednisone 60mg daily and with aggressive nebulizer
treatment. Over the course her stay, her resp status
dramatically improved. She was discharged with a slow 10 day
taper.  She was weaned off oxygen with some residual cough. Lung
exam improved with some residual crackles and wheezing at bases.
 Had been ruled out for flu. PE also possible but less likely
given therapeutic on coumadin on admission. Viral culture showed
RSV and after discussion with ID the treatment is just
supportive care.
.
#.Anemia. Hct stable. Iron studies c/w mixed iron deficiency and
likely chronic disease. Recent baseline hct low 30s, however was
40 on admission likely hemoconcentrated in setting of illness.
No obvious bleeding. Hct remained stable. Her iron was increased
to [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Coagulopathy: Pt on warfarin at home for planned 4 week
post-op course since [**1-26**]. Elevated INR in setting of abx use
on admission but then became subtherapeutic after holding doses.
 It was restarted but she was not yet therapeutic upon
discharge. No evidence of bleeding.
.
# Anxiety: stable, cont home PRN ativan
.
# HTN: reasonably controlled, cont home lisinopril
.
# TKR: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Has outpatient appt with him on
Friday. Cont warfarin management as above, patient to go home
with PT, pain control with oxycodone.  Given subQhep while
subtherapeutic on coumadin and TEDS.
