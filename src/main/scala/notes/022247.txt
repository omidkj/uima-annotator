Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30158**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
66 year-old female with COPD and multiple admissions for
exacerbation, who presents from home with 5-7 days of SOB, cough
productive of white sputum, and increased use of nebulizers.
Denies any fevers, chills, CP/pressure, LH/dizziness.
.
In the ED, VS 96.6, 100, 132/81, 26, 90% RA. Initial exam with
poor air movement throughout. Given nebs, methylprednisolone 125
mg IV, ceftriaxone and azithromycin. ABG 7.45/39/60. She became
tachypnic to the 40s and was placed on BiPAP with good effect ->
ABG 7.40/42/120. CTA performed and negative for PE.
.
The patient was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia. On transfer,
the patient noted her breathing was improved. "I am hungry and
want my breakfast." The patient was taken off BiPAP on arrival.

.
MICU course: The patient was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for CAP. The patient was started on steroids IV.
She was started on spiriva. The patient developed a rash thought
to be secondary to hypersensitivity to the cleaning products
used; it is improving despite continuing the above antibiotics.
The patient developed leukocytosis thought secondary to
steroids. The patient had sinus tachycardia thought secondary to
albuterol which was improved prior to transfer.
.
On transfer, the patient states her SOB is much improved, to 70%
of baseline. The patient's cough continues but is also improved.
The patient complains of mild generalized abdominal discomfort
attibuted to constipation. The patient denies fevers, chills,
chest pain. The patient denies hearing voices. No other
complaints.
.
Recent admission in [**Month (only) 547**]:
COPD exacerbation: She was hypoxic and required a face mask
initially. She was given standing nebulizers and started on IV
steroids, switched to oral prednisone after 3 days. She was
given Augmentin for inflammatory effect, and should complete a
7-day course (last day = [**2123-4-29**]). CTA chest was performed and
was negative for PE or pneumonia. Pt was evaluated by pulmonary
who recommended a long steroid taper (4-6 weeks) along with
Advair inhaled daily. She should take 40mg prednisone x 7days
([**Date range (1) 46556**]), then 20mg x 7days ([**Date range (1) 70307**]), then 10mg x 7days
([**Date range (1) 70308**]), then 5mg x 7days ([**Date range (1) 70309**]), then stop. The cause
for her flare is unkonwn, possibly viral illness vs allergies.
Speech and swallow evaluation was performed to see if aspiration
pneumonitis was the trigger, and revealed no difficulty with
swallowing and no sign of aspiration. She should remain on
supplemental O2 until she can maintain O2 saturations >93% on
room air at rest and with ambulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year-old female with history of COPD presenting with
shortness of breath, cough productive of white sputum, and
hypoxia.
.
1. Hypoxia: Most likely represented a COPD exacerbation, likely
due to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was afebrile
but had mild leukocytosis and complained of a productive cough.
The patient was recently treated for community-acquired
pneumonia. A viral bronchitis could also have precipitated the
exacerbation. The patient had no evidence of congestive heart
failure on physical examination or imaging; the patient does not
have an echocardiogram in our system. CTA was negative for
pulmonary embolus on admission. The patient was initially
maintained on BiPAP but her oxygen requirement quickly improved.
The patient was given steroids, initially intravenously, then
changed to oral for a slow taper. The patient was started on
spiriva. The patient was continued on albuterol nebulizers
standing and with xopenex nebulizers as needed. The patient was
continued on advair. The patient was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia and changed to
levofloxacin prior to discharge to complete a ten day course.
The patient's oxygen requirement improved during admission and
she did not require oxygen on discharge. The patient is on home
O2 2L at baseline overnight and with exertion. The patient was
advised to stop smoking.
.
2. Tachycardia: The patient had sinus tachycardia to heart rate
120s during admission. This was likely due to albuterol. The
tachycardia improved with the change of albuterol to xopenex
nebulizers as needed.
.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count was 13.1
on admission, likely due to the patient's pneumonia as above.
The white blood cell count increased to 22-24 after initiation
of steroids, likely secondary to demarginalization of white
blood cells. The patient remained afebrile. Urinalysis was
negative for infection.
.
4. Rash: The patient developed a rash during admission,
initially an erythematous macular pruritic rash on the trunk and
flanks. This was likely a reaction to cleaning products and
improved during admission by using bleach-free sheets and
different self-care products. This was unlikely a reaction to
her antibiotics as it improved prior to changing the regimen.
The patient was given benadryl and sarna as needed.
