Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1350**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck pain and arm weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Bilateral laminotomy, C3, C4.
2. Posterior cervical fusion, C3-C4, C4-C5.
3. Posterolateral spinal instrumentation C3, C4, C5.
4. Application of local autograft for fusion augmentation.
5. Application of allograft for fusion augmentation


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 61229**] is a 49-year-old male who was
diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in [**2104**]. Since that time,
he has been diagnosed with multiple metastases including
skeletal metastases. Recently, he developed neck pain which
was progressive, and then associated with weakness of his
left arm in the C5 distribution with deltoid and also biceps
weakness. This caused considerable loss of function. He
underwent an MRI as recommended by his medical oncologist,
which demonstrated an infiltrative lesion within C4, causing
spinal cord compression as well as severe nerve root
compression. CSF space was obliterated and there was spinal
cord signal change. There was considerable instability within
the C4 vertebral body. Due to the nature of this disease, in
concert with the severity of symptoms, pending spinal
instability and spinal cord compression, he elected to
undergo surgical treatment to help accomplish the goals of
anterior cervical spinal cord decompression with interbody
reconstruction and fusion.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61229**] was diagnosed with a 1.45 mm thick,
[**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV melanoma from his lower back in [**2104**].  He
underwent wide local excision and bilateral inguinal negative
sentinel lymph node biopsies. He developed left inguinal
recurrence in [**12/2111**], undergoing completion left inguinal lymph
node dissection on [**2112-2-8**] with pathology revealing melanoma
in four of nine nodes with extracapsular extension.  He received
radiation therapy to the left inguinal region completing in
05/[**2111**].  He began interferon off protocol in [**5-/2112**] with
therapy discontinued on [**2112-10-19**] due to radiation colitis.  In
[**2-/2113**], he underwent biopsy of a right clavicular lesion by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing a 0.45 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level III melanoma.  He
underwent wide local excision in 04/[**2112**].  In [**6-/2114**], he had
biopsy of a left mandible skin lesion revealing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10834**] level
III, 0.51 mm thick melanoma with three mitoses per mm2.  On
[**2114-7-23**], he underwent wide local excision and sentinel lymph
node biopsy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**] with no residual
melanoma
at the primary site, but one of three lymph nodes showed a
microscopic deposit of melanoma.  He underwent modified left
neck
dissection on [**2114-7-30**] with no melanoma noted in seven
additional nodes.  In [**2115-6-4**], he underwent biopsy of a new
right chest wall skin lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing metastatic
melanoma not seen at the margin without an epidermal component
and two mitoses per mm2.  It was unclear whether this
represented
an in-tranist metastasis from his right clavicle melanoma or an
epidermatrophic metastasis. He underwent right chest wide local
excision and right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1924**] on [**2115-7-18**].  There was no evidence of residual
melanoma in the chest or in the sentinel lymph node.  Staging
scans were negative and he began GM-CSF off protocol on
[**2115-9-4**], completing 13 cycles in [**2116-8-4**]. Torso CT in
[**9-11**] revealed new small bilateral pulmonary nodules and an
abnormal right kidney. CT guided biopsy of the right kidney on
[**2116-10-27**] confirmed metastatic melanoma. He began the Phase I/II
RAF 265 trial on [**2116-12-22**]. Therapy was held on C1W4, [**1-12**], due
to
visual problems, fatigue and anorexia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service and
taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure.  Refer to
the dictated operative note for further details.  The surgery
was without complication and the patient was transferred to the
PACU in a stable condition.  TEDs/pnemoboots were used for
postoperative DVT prophylaxis.  Intravenous antibiotics were
continued for 24hrs postop per standard protocol. Initial postop
pain was controlled with a PCA.  Diet was advanced as tolerated.
 The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication when
tolerating PO diet.  Foley was removed on POD#2.  Physical
therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate.
Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable.  On the day of
discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs,
comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
Patient was scheduled for lumbar spinal decompression and fusion
but the surgery was cancelled due to persistent fever and on the
advise of Oncology team.
