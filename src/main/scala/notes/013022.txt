Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath with exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Patch clousre of right sinus of Valsalva aneurysm [**2128-5-25**]


History of Present Illness:
56 year old male with known right sinus of Valsalva aneurysm and
mildly dilated Aortic root and minimally dilated ascending
aorta. Followed with serial
echocardiograms and CT scans. The echocardiograms for several
years leading up to visit in [**2125**] showed pretty stable aneurysm
measuring approximately 5.2cm. Recommendation was no surgery and
follow-up in 1 year with repeat CT and Echo. Recently underwent
CT scan in [**2128-1-22**] but given lack of contrast, it was
difficult to assess the sinuses of Valsalva. Aorta measured
4.0cm
at level of main pulmonary artery. He underwent an echo
which revealed the aorta at the level of the sinus measured
6.1cm. He was underwent cardiac catheterization in
preperation for surgical repair and found to have clean
coronaries.
He is admitted for surgical repair.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
transgastric technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The aortic root is severely dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There was a 2cm x 2cm [**Location (un) 49109**] aneurysm of the right coronary
sinus with a broad neck. No associated VSDs seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before
surgical incsion.

Post Bypass:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
No valvular findings.
Intact thoracic aorta.
The sinus patch appears intact and no flow across. The old
aneurysm appears to be excluded from the main
flow.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 56 year old male with
known right sinus of Valsalva aneurysm and mildly dilated Aortic
root and minimally dilated ascending aorta. Followed with serial
echocardiograms and CT scans. The echocardiograms showed
increased aneurysm size and surgerical repair was advised.
During the pre-op work up a diagnostic cardiac cath was done on
[**4-8**] showed non- significant coronary disease.
On [**5-25**] he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a
patch closure of his right sinus of valsalva. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Later that day he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. He was started on lopressor
and lasix. Chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed
per protocol.  He did develop an ileus.  General surgery was
consulted.  The patient was kept NPO on IVF with an NGT.  Ileus
resolved and the patient's diet was advanced as tolerated.
Additionally, he developed pain in the left foot.  XRay showed
no fracture or bony abnormality detected.

He was evaluated by physical therapy for strength and
conditioning and cleared for discharge to home on POD#9. All
instructions and appointments were advised.
