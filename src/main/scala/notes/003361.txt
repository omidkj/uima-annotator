Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
VT storm, unable to extubate after VT ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with coronary artery disease
status post single vessel CABG with previous critical aortic
stenosis status post-aortic valve repair in [**2196**], status post
AICD, history of PEA arrest, history of VT, who presented to [**Hospital1 **] with VT storm [**2-25**] with 40 ICD shocks and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for VT ablation.  Pt. with VT initially post CABG/AVR,
and was started on amiodarone and mexelitine which he did not
tolerate.
.
The patient reports sitting at home watching TV, then went to
the bathroom and felt ICD fire.  The patient denies prior
palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath or dizziness.  ICD
fired several times.
.
At [**Hospital3 **], pt. continued ot have VT in the ED, and the
patient was was started on lidocaine and amiodarone drips and
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  He was started on p.o.
Amiodarone load and lidocaine drip was discontinued without any
further episodes of VT.  The patient had a cardiac cath which is
unchanged from [**3-10**].  He has LAD 40% ostial lesion, left
circumflex, 70% ostial lesion, RCA 40% mid lesion with patent
left circ.  He also had an TTE demonstrating reduced EF (30-35%)
compared to 1 year ago (40%).
.
Transferred here for VT ablation.  In EP lab, intubated and
found to have 2 separate foci near mitral valve annulus. [**12-5**] VT
foci were able to be ablated.  In addition, had pacer adjusted
such that when VT was induced burst pacing extinguished 2nd site
of VT.  He was initially extubated, but was somewhat somnolent,
and given a h/o hypoxia-induced PEA arrest s/p extubation from
inguinal repair last year, pt. was re-intubated easily and
transferred to PACU for further monitoring.  Of note, pt. was
positive 1L during procedure.
.
In PACU, had CXR demonstrating likely reflecting left pleural
effusion and fluid overload.  Currently, pt. is intubated,
sedated on propofol, L arterial sheath pulled at 7PM.
.
Review of symptoms unable to be obtained [**1-5**] sedation.  Review
of PMH shows recent MCA stroke, with need for walker at
baseline.  No report of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Per [**Hospital1 **] notes, he denied recent fevers, chills or rigors.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
CXR on admission: Lung volumes are low with opacification of the
left lower lobe, likely reflecting left pleural effusion and
atelectasis.  Consolidation can't be excluded.  Vascular
redistribution in the right upper lobe suggests fluid overload.
.
CXR at [**Hospital3 **] ([**2-25**]):
The diaphragms are markedly elevated with low lung volumes.
This makes evaluation of the lung bases impossible.  There is
suggestion of increasing interstitial opacities of the upper
lung zones which could be a function of the high diaphragms or
some superimposed edema.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2199-2-25**] demonstrated (per [**Hospital1 **] ECHO report):
Technically difficult study.  LV dimensions mildly dilated.
Global LV systolic function is moderately to severely reduced
with an estimated EF of 30-35%. There is global hypokinesis with
abnormal septal motion.  RV is mildly dilated with moderate
hypokinesis. There is moderate biatrial enlargement.  Aortic
valve bioprosthesis appears to be well seated with appropriate
gradients for this valve. Trace AR. Mitral leaflets are mildly
thickened with mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with moderate PHTN. Estimated
PASP is 43 mmHg + CVP.  A minimal pericardial effusion is seen.
Pacer wire is noted in right heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].  Compared to prior
study dated [**2198-6-30**], LV systolic function appears somewhat lower
on the current study.
.
ETT performed on [**11-8**] demonstrated:
A Dobutamine stress echo was carried out during which time peak
HR of 127bpm was obtained (86% of maximum predicted HR).  At
rest, LVEF estimated 25%. Evidence of LVH as well as LAE. Global
LV systolic dysfunction.  Aortic valve moderately calcified with
40mmHg peak gradient and 20mmHg mean valve gradient.  This
represents no significant change from prior study of [**2196-11-8**].
With Dobutamine, LVEF increased to 35-40%.  Again, global
hypokinesis was seen.  Peak gradient increased to 65mmHg with
mean gradient of 26 mmHg.  Unfortunately, LVOT velocity could
not be obtained either at rest or at peak dose Dobutamine,
therefore aortic valve area could not be calculated.  These
findings however appear to be most consistent with a
cardiomyopathy with moderate AS rather than hemodynamic
insignificant AS.  Suggest clinical correlation.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2199-2-25**] demonstrated:
 The patient had a cardiac cath which is unchanged from [**3-10**].
He is LAV 40% ostial lesion, left circumflex, 70% ostial lesion,
RCA 40% mid lesion and he describes to us left circumflex is
patent.
