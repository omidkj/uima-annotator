Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for eval of aortic stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2105-2-26**] - CABGx1 (Vein->Diagonal artery), AVR (23mm pericardial
valve)
[**2105-2-25**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is an 82-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia,
hypertension , aortic stenosis and CAD.  He underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2104-9-16**] where he was found to have a
90% lesion in his proximal large diagonal branch and a 50%
lesion in the distal RCA.  He subsequently had a stent to his
diag .  He returned to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2105-2-16**] by ambulance
after he almost fell due to dizziness. He had also been having
worsening shortness of breath for approximately 2 weeks.   He
was found on CXR in the ED to have pneumonia and CHF.  His BNP
was 3466 on admission.  He was admitted, diuresed and given
antibiotics, which he finished prior to discharge. He was felt
to be stable and essentially baseline upon discharge with marked
improvement. A repeat echo at [**Hospital1 46**] showed a new EF of 20% and
severe AS although echos have traditionally overestimated
gradient and underestimated his valve area. Case in point, an
echo in [**7-18**] showed: concentric LVH, LVEF 60%. a peak gradient
of 77 mmHG, mean of 50 mmHG, maximum velocity 4.4 m/s,[**Location (un) 109**]
0.5cm2. However, cardiac catheterization in [**9-17**] showed a peak
to peak gradient of 20 mm Hg and a calculated aortic valve area
of 1.24 cm2. Thus at that time was not referred to aortic valve
replacement. He was referred here from [**Hospital1 46**] for evalation of
his coronaries and his valve area, as either may be the cause of
his newly worsened heart failure.

The patient notes slowly progressive decrease in functional
status, with DOE after ascending one flight of stairs. The
patient also endorses occasional PND without orthopnea. He also
notes positional lightheadedness but no syncope or exertional
lightheadness. He denies chest discomfort, either exertional or
at rest. He has previously been scheduled for possible AVR but
has failed to meet criteria based on his catherizations.

TTE:
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <<0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets and supporting structures are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Normal left
ventricular cavity size with severe global hypokinesis with
relative sparing of apical segments (suggestive of a
non-ischemic etiology). Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR:
The only comparison study is from [**2100-6-29**]. As on this
examination, there is marked hyperexpansion of the lungs with
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of the
aorta. Mild prominence of interstitial markings could reflect
chronic lung disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or
both. Some atelectatic change is seen at the left base. Blunting
of both costophrenic angles is consistent with bilateral pleural
effusions or scarring from previous inflammatory changes.

Specifically, no evidence of acute pneumonia.

[**2105-2-25**] Chest CT Scan
1) Significant calcification of the aortic valve and to a lesser
degree of the aortic annulus. However, the calcification
bypasses the ascending aorta by at least 11 cm.
2) A lesion in the right lobe of the liver requires evaluation.
Consider a dedicated liver CT with contrast or MRI.
3) Calcified cyst-like structure in the spleen. The differential
would include a traumatic cyst, epidermoid, or parasitic cyst.
Evaluation with US or Abdominal CT is recommended.
4) Prominent interstitial thickening seen in the lung bases left
more than right which could be attributed to infection and/or
aspiration. Please clinically correlate.

[**2105-2-26**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is dilated. Moderate spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
2. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s).
3. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
4. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %).
5. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis.
6. The aortic root is moderately
