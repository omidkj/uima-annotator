Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2166-8-28**]. Potassium was 7.0. This was treated with IV
insulin, dextrose, bicarb and calcium gluconate. EKG revealed
non-specific lateral and anterolateral ST-T wave changes. Repeat
potassium was 5.0. CT of the head revealed no intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect.Chest and abdominal CT demonstrated
the following " 1. Diffuse bilateral segmental and subsegmental
pulmonary emboli.
2. New large splenic infarct.
3. 5 mm nodule in the right lower lobe, which appears more
prominent than on [**2166-3-25**], possibly related to slice selection.
Follow-up is recommended in 3 months." On exam, he was awake,
oriented to person & hospital only. Respiratory rate was even,
and non-labored. Breath sounds were decreased at the bases. He
was transferred to the SICU for close monitoring.
He was started on IV heparin and PTTs were monitored for goal 0f
60-80. Coumadin was initiated. INR was 1.0 on [**2166-9-1**]. A TTE was
done to evaluate for source of PEs and to assess for PFO. This
demonstrated " Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
3. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.
4. No evidence of endocarditis seen.". Bilateral lower extremity
noninvasive ultrasounds was done. A deep vein thrombosis was
identified within the right popliteal vein.
A left subclavian central venous line was inserted and a CXR
demonstrated the tip in the upper SVC. "Compared to the previous
study, the lungs are better expanded and there is near complete
resolution of multifocal parenchymal opacities. Lung volumes
still remain low with crowding of the pulmonary vessels.
Residual right basilar opacity is present." A liver duplex
demonstrated:
"1. Limited study shows heterogeneously echoic subhepatic area
which likely represents evolution of previously identified
collection in this area.
2. Normal liver Doppler ultrasound.
3. Ultrasound-guided mark over the right lobe of the liver
placed for biopsy to be performed by clinical staff."

He was transferred out of the SICU and back to the med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit
once stable on hospital day 3.

He was started on Solumedrol 250mg IV qd for three days for
presumed transplant rejection based on elevated LFTs (AST 997,
ALT 1148, Alk Phos 1440 and t.bili of 1.4). LFTs decreased to
AST 27, ALT 147, alk phos 564, and t.bili of 0.3 on [**2166-9-1**].
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to help manage hyperglycemia. Glucoses
ranged between 180 and 430 at which time he was started on an
insulin drip with glucoses imroving to 150. The insulin drip was
tapered off and sliding scale insulin with long acting insulin
resumed. He was continued on Prednisone 10mg qd, cellcept 500mg
qid and prograf 1.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Prograf levels were 13.5, 9.3, 10.6
and 10.1.
A post pyloric feeding tube was replaced and tube feedings of
Nepro were started with goal rate of 60cc. The rate was advanced
without any GI discomfort. [**Hospital1 **] was consulted. Cycled tube
feedings at 60cc/hour x 14 hours were recommended.

Psychiatry was consulted for evaluation of his depression.
Initial recommendations included restarting Ritalin to help
increase energy level due to depression and to encourage
improved po intake. Remeron was recommended as well as taper of
Zoloft. Ritalin was held, zoloft was tapered off and Remeron was
initiated. A follow up psychiatry consult generated
recommendations to delay restarting Ritalin,taper Zoloft and
holding off on starting Remeron and Marinol until less confused.
An EEG was recommended as well as checking TSH and B12 level. On
admission, a urine tox screen was negative.

Blood cultures and a CMV viral load was drawn on [**2166-8-29**]. All
were negative. WBC dropped to 1.9 on hospital day 2, and
subsequently increased to 9.6 after administration of neupogen.

Vital signs were stable and he was afebrile.
