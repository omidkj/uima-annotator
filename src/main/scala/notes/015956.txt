Chief Complaint:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 56552**].
HPI: 19 y/o male with ALL day 176 s/p MUD allogenic stem cell
transplant with GVHD of skin, gut/liver, and now possibly lung.
He was admitted on eweek prior for new onset DOE of about two
weeks now. During workup last admission, CXR was abnormal with
bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates. High resolution CT showed
tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance in lower lobes consistant with infectious
process. Echo showed normal EF. He was seen by Pulmonary, and
bronchoscopy was done. BAL was non contributory, negative for
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 56553**] was negative. He was started on combivent and
his pulmocort was changed to fluticasone. He was started on
azithromycin to cover atypical PNA, atovaquonefor PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. He had [**Name Initial (PRE) 1570**]'s checked on [**2168-4-26**], which showed FEV1
of 0.95 L. Last bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed a
hypocellular marrow with a cellularity of less than 10%. No
evidence of leukemia was seen and he was full donor chimerism.
.
He comes in today after being seen in the clinic with continued
SOB. He is being admitted for further workup and possibly open
lung biopsy.
.
Oncology History: He was diagnosed with pre-B-cell ALL in [**2166-6-17**]
after presenting with fatigue, DOE, dizziness, 20lb. weight
loss, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. He was found to have
pancytopenia with a Hct of 15. Following diagnosis he underwent
induction therapy on the E-2993 protocol, with intrathecal
methotrexate on day 24 as per protocol. His initial bone marrow
aspiration and biopsy on day +24 showed resolution of most of
his prior abnormal cytogenetics, but persistence of aneuploidy
4. He received phase II of induction chemotherapy with
cyclophosphamide, ARA-C, 6-MP for 28 days. He received
intensification with high-dose MTX, followed by consolidation
therapy with cyclophosphamide and etoposide (EP-16). This was
completed with the addition of dexamethasone and 6-TG in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2167**]. In [**2167-5-15**], he underwent a repeat bone marrow aspirate
and biopsy. The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed karyotype
47,XYY, and no evidence by FISH of the prior mentioned
cytogenetic abnormalities. A recent bone marrow biopsy revealed
mildly hypocellular marrow with maturing trilineage
hematopoiesis and no evidence of ALL, but cytogenetic testing
revealed aneuploidy of chromosome 4 in 12% of cells. He was
admitted on [**2167-8-28**] and began repeat induction with the
ECOG-2993 protocol including Daunarubicin, Vincristine,
Prednisone, and L-Asparaginase with intrathecal methotrexate on
day 10. LP cytology results demonstrated no malignant cells in
sampled CSF. The patient's course of chemotherapy was
complicated by hypomania secondary to high dose prednisone,
hypofibrinogenemia secondary to therapy with L-Asparaginase,
neutropenic fever, and multiple LFT abnormalities. The etiology
of the rise in his transaminases was thought most likely to be
due to a drug reaction. The viral testing was negative. Given
that he was scheduled to undergo an allogeneic transplant with
Cytoxan and TBI conditioning, he did undergo a liver biopsy to
assess the degree of fibrosis as well as inflammation prior to
proceeding with transplant. The liver biopsy showed moderate
microvascular steatosis with mild bile duct injury and
occasional apoptotic hepatocytes, consistent with drug injury.
Special stains for fungi, herpes simplex virus, and CMV were
negative. However, given that his ALT was still at 200, the
transplant planned for [**10-8**] was delayed until [**2167-10-29**] to try
and reduce the risk of VOD. Bone marrow bx from [**10-1**] showed
markedly hypocellular marrow with early recovering trilineage
hemopoesis, no residual ALL identified. Pt was admitted on
[**2167-10-23**] precondition with cytoxan and TBI for an allo transplant.
Last allo transplant complicated by GVH for which he was on
steroids and cyclosporin.

HPI: 19 y/o male with ALL several months out from MUD allogenic
stem cell transplant complicated by GVHD of skin, gut/liver. He
was admitted recently for new onset DOE, workup up with
bronchospopy which was negative for infectious cause, and
discharged, on azithromycin for atypical PNA and atovaquone for
PCP prophylaxis, with room air saturation in the mid 90's with
ambulation.  He was readmitted after clinic visit showed no
improvement in symptomes. His antibiotics were changed to Vanco,
Cefepime, and Levofloxacin. He underwent VATS procedure for
definitve diagnosis between BOOP/BO vs. Infection. Procedure
went well, but post op course was complicated by chest tube
related pneumothorax.
.
He reports feeling well currently with no SOB, but with some
left sided pain with inspiration, coughing. Pain has been well
controlled with morphine PCA. He denies headache, dysuria,
constipation or diarrhea. He has a good appetite.
