Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
 respiratory distress, transferred from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 y/o male with a PMH significant for HTN and
?history of pleurisy 20+ year ago, with symptoms of dyspnea,
tachypnea, and pleuritic chest pain intermittently since [**Month (only) 359**]
of this year, who presented with acute respiratory distress 1
day ago.  History is obtained primarily from the patient's
family due to patient's respiratory status and lack of records:
.
The patient is generally a healthy male with only HTN who began
having pulmonary symptoms back in [**Month (only) 359**] of this year.  Per his
wife, the patient was having intermittent dyspnea with exertion
and at rest with pleuritic chest pain.  No orthopnea, PND.  In
addition, he has intermittent fevers with temps up to 101.4 with
his symptoms - no night sweats.  No cough, hemoptysis, URI
symptoms.  No recent known sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] saw his PCP for
these symptoms and was tried on at least 2 course of antibiotics
with minimal improvement.  In addition, he saw a pulmonologist
as well, and was told that his symptoms may be secondary to an
"allergy" exposure.  He has had several CXRs and CT scans which
reportedly "did not show anything bad."  He had a negative PPD 1
month ago and has had no exposures to TB or other agents that
the family is aware of.  Between his episodes of symptoms, he
would feel well back to his baseline and was back to his
baseline state of health for 3-4 weeks prior to this
presentation.  He recently traveled to [**State 4260**] for a business trip
and returned late Wednesday night (3 days PTA) and was feeling
well until yesterday (Friday) morning when he began having
symptoms of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain again.  This
occured while he was at work and he was noted to appear very ill
by his secretary, who called EMS.  The patient also reported
symptoms of nausea and dizzness at the time of his respiratory
distress.  He was taken to [**Hospital6 17032**] by EMS.

.
At the OSH, initial VS were T 97.3, BP 97/50, HR 60, RR 28-30,
SaO2 100%/2L. The patient was dyspneic but able to speak
complete sentences per the family. He became progressively
tachypneic into the 50's and diaphoretic, unable to complete
full sentences. A CXR by report demonstrated "multiple opacities
in the right lung field and RLL infiltrate." An initial ABG was
7.46/28/36 on 2 L NC. Per report, a CT (?CTA) of the chest
showed bilateral infiltrates. He spiked to 101.6 around 9pm at
the OSH. He received 750 mg IV levaquin, 2 gm IV Rocephin, and
60 mg IV solumedrol q6 hours. He also received IV morphine and
ativan. During his ED course, he became progressively dyspneic
and tachypneic, and was feeling more fatigued. A repeat CXR per
report showed worsening bilateral infiltrates. The patient was
intubated subsequently for hypoxic respiratory distress around 3
am [**2152-1-15**] on settings AC 500x14, FiO2 100%, PEEP 10 with PIP's
28-30.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and sedated.
 A left IJ CVL was placed and a right A-line was placed.  He was
briefly on peripheral dopamine for hypotension (SBP 80's) in the
setting of increased sedation while intubated.
.
ROS - No URI sx, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain (except for the
pleuritic chest pain at the time of symptoms), n/v/abdominal
pain, diarrhea, blood in stools, dysuria, hematuria, edema.
+40-lb weight loss since Septemeber intentionally. No changes in
appetite. No early satiety. No skin changes. +frequent travels
to the East Coast and Midwest for business.

.
IMAGING - OSH CT reviewed in detail with radiology: Diffuse
airspace disease, with less involvement of the anterior
segments; no PE appreciated; 1 calcified granuloma in the RUL;
no emphysematous changes
.
[**1-14**] EKG at OSH - Sinus bradycardia at 58 bpm. Slightly
prolonged PR interval. LAD. No ischemic ST or T wave changes
noted. No prior for comparison.
.
[**1-17**] CT chest:
Endotracheal tube terminates just above the thoracic inlet
level, approximately 7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube
terminates in the stomach, and a left internal jugular catheter
terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein.
Within the lungs, dependent areas of consolidation are present
within both lower lobes, and a gradient of ground-glass
attenuation is present in the remainder of the lungs, more
prominent posteriorly with relative sparing of the most
nondependent anterior portions of the lungs. Specifically, there
are no areas of consolidation within the least dependent
portions of the lungs. Central airways are remarkable for
retained secretions within the right main, right upper lobe, and
bronchus intermedius. Incidental note is made of a calcified
granuloma in the right upper lobe with associated calcified
lymph nodes in the right paratracheal and right hilar regions.
Slightly prominent noncalcified lymph nodes are present within
the subcarinal region. Heart size is normal. Coronary artery
calcifications are present. No pericardial or substantial
pleural effusions are identified.
Examination was not specifically tailored to evaluate the
subdiaphragmatic region, but adrenal glands are well visualized
and normal in appearance. High attenuation is present within the
gallbladder, possibly due to vicarious excretion if the patient
has had recent intravenous contrast-enhanced study (no contrast
given for this examination).
Skeletal structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic
skeletal lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Lung parenchymal findings consistent with provided history of
ARDS, but coexisting infection cannot be excluded by imaging
alone.
2. Proximal position of endotracheal tube which has been
advanced since the time of the CT scan (as documented on
separate CXR).
3. High attenuation material within the gallbladder, possibly
due to vicarious excretion of contrast if the patient has
received recent contrast administration. In the absence of
contrast administration, this may represent high attenuation
sludge. Gallbladder ultrasound could be considered if warranted
clinically.
.
Echo [**1-17**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal
