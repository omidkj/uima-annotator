Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year-old female
with multiple medical problems including coronary artery
disease status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction between 30
and 40%, type 2 diabetes, breast carcinoma status post
bilateral mastectomy, hypothyroidism, status post
cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease,
osteoarthritis, parietal lobe AVM, gastroesophageal reflux
disease and a history of thrombocytopenia and a history of
hyponatremia.  The patient was found unresponsive in her
house by some neighbors and EMS was therefore called.  Prior
to this the patient had refused all social interventions
including visiting nurse and home health aids.  It was noted
by her close friend and proxy Ms. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 99202**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 99203**]
that the patient while refusing these home services had been
limited to the [**Location (un) 448**] of her two story house and was
unable to reach the second story to shower, because of
generalized weakness.

When the patient was brought to the Emergency Department on
the [**5-30**] her vital signs were temperature 95, blood
pressure 200/85, heart rate 68, respirations 18 and sating
96% on room air.  The patient was found to be unable to
follow directions, would not lie still.  CT was attempted,
however, not done secondary to agitation.  In the Emergency
Department the patient's blood pressure began to fall, second
blood pressure was noted to be 118/68, subsequent blood
pressure was 80/40, telemetry indicated heart rate of
recorded is 56 in the Emergency Department notes.  Blood
sugars were also found to be 66 and she was given 1 amp of
D50.  Dopamine was started to maintain the patient's blood
pressure.  The patient remained sleepy and hypothermic with a
temperature of 36.6 degrees centigrade.  A bear hugger was
started and blood cultures were drawn.  The patient's O2 sats
dropped to 78% and the patient was started on 100%
nonrebreather mask.  It was decided at this point by the
Emergency Department to intubate the patient at this time.
Anesthesia was called, because it was difficult to intubate.
Anesthesia made multiple attempts to intubate, but given her
anatomy the attempt was difficult.  A fiberoptic machine was
brought from the Operating Room with successful intubation
with a #6, however, as a result of this intubation the
patient developed epistaxis and required packings placed by
ENT to control the bleeding.  The patient was therefore
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
care.

Upon presentation to the Intensive Care Unit the patient's
vital signs were blood pressure 120/78, heart rate 88,
respirations 8, and she was 97% on the ventilator.  She was
unresponsive to voice.  Heart examination was regular, though
notable for a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur.  Lung
examination was notable for bilateral wheezes as well as
bilateral rhonchi.  The abdomen was soft, notable for
normoactive bowel sounds and there was 1+ bilateral edema of
the lower extremities.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  It should be noted the patient as mentioned
above has been living alone.  She does not drink or does not
smoke and has no involved family except for possibly a
nephew.  The patient's proxy is her friend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 99203**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Zestril 5 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg a day,
Protonix 40 mg a day, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., folate 1 mg a
day, thiamine 100 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily.

Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram was sinus rhythm with primary AV delay and
left bundle branch block.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 3.4, hematocrit 34.9,
glucose 128, sodium 131, potassium 7.2 hemolyzed repeat was
3.6, chloride 90, bicarbonate was 19, BUN 116, creatinine 3.5
with glucose of 76.  Urinalysis was notable for moderate
blood, 0 to 2 reds, no ketones, 30 protein, 0 to 2 white
blood cells.  Initial CK was 116 and blood gas was 7.22 pH,
PCO2 of 39, PO2 129.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was empirically treated with
Flagyl 500 mg intravenous q 8 hours, Ampicillin 1 gram
intravenous q 8 hours and Levofloxacin 250 mg intravenous
q.d. dosed for renal function.  She was continued on the
phenylephrine pressor and was also given intravenous
Dexamethasone, because of the swelling had resulted from the
traumatic intubation attempts on her.  Her Dopamine drip was
at 10 micrograms per kilogram per hour when she was admitted
to the floor.

Her time to wean off the vent was delayed, because of the
issue of epistaxis packing put by ENT Department to control
the bleeding.  They recommended a full five to seven day
course of packing at which time they would reevaluate for any
source of bleeding.  She also was noted to have marked pharyngeal
edema limiting the size of her upper airway this is despite
initial doses of the intravenous Dexamethasone.  The plan was
decided to continue the intravenous steroids transitioning to
Prednisone 40 po q day to be delivered via her OG tube.  After
five days the oropharynx was reevaluated by ENT who asked us to
wait for an additional day.  The packing was removed by ENT after
approximately six days.  There was some residual bleeding,
but no significant bleed was noted just a little bit of
oozing.  The decision was therefore made to extubate the
patient on the subsequent day.  The patient's sedation was
changed from Versed and Fentanyl to Propofol, because of the
shorter half life and the patient was successfully weaned on
the first attempt the subsequent day.  The patient was noted
to have copious secretions at that point and some question of
her ability to cough to protect her airway, so the decision
was made to keep the patient in the unit for an additional
day for observation.

The plan at this point is to call the patient out on to the
floor.  The primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 35914**] has
been sent word of this planned transfer and we are waiting
for administrative disposition for this transfer for this to
occur.  Further details will be dictated including discharge
plans by the accepting medical team when that time arrives,
but planned day for call out from the unit to the floor is
today [**2198-5-9**].
