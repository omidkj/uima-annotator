Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemorrhage


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated

History of Present Illness:
56 yo with unknown medical history was found down and presented
to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  At around 4pm today, the notes say that he
went to the car to "de-stress" and collapsed next to the car.
EMS was called and he presented to [**Hospital1 **] (EMS note not
available).  At [**Hospital1 **], his SBP was in the 200s and blood
glucose 44.  He was noted to have slurred speech, flaccid on the
left side, eyes deviated to the right, right mouth droop, left
neglect, and not following commands.  A head CT was done, which
showed a right basal ganglia bleed 5.6 x 2.2 cm with edema and
midline shift.  He was intubated (unclear if deteriorated for
because of CT findings) and sedated with Feantanyl 50 mcg,
Versed 6mg, Ativan 2mg, Vec 10mg, Succ 100, and Etomidate 20mg.
He was also loaded with Dilantin 1gm.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

Since arrival, he has had repeat imaging, which shows that the
hemorrhage is a little larger at 6.2 x 2.6cm.  His SBP has been
in the 130s.  He remains intubated and sedated on Propofol.

Renal Ultrasound:[**2133-3-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for renal artery stenosis.
2. Normal-sized kidneys. 5 cm septated right upper pole cyst,
and 1.2-cm left interpolar cystic lesion with minimal internal
echogenicity, six-month followup study is advised to document
stability.

CT Torso:
1. No evidence of acute bony or soft organ injury.
2. Multifocal consolidation within the lungs, atypical in
appearance for aspiration, and most likely representing
aspiration, though other pneumonia cannot be excluded.
3. Possible bladder wall thickening.

CT Head [**3-2**]:
1. Large right lenticular nucleus intraparenchymal hemorrhage
with slight surrounding edema, slightly larger since the recent
OSH study; the findings suggest an underlying hypertensive
etiology. If more detailed evaluation is needed, recommend
scanning the outside study into PACS for side-by-side
comparison.
2. Slight effacement of the right lateral ventricular atrium and
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and leftward shift of the midline structures, by
approximately 3 mm.

CT/CTA [**3-4**]:
1. Right basal ganglia hemorrhage which is not significantly
changed compared to the prior CT of [**2133-3-3**].
2. CT angiography demonstrates no evidence of aneurysm or
abnormal vascular structures or evidence of stenosis or
occlusion.

CT [**2133-3-20**]:
IMPRESSION: Decrease in the amount of hyperdense blood with
persistent surrounding edema and mass effect consistent with
evolving hemorrhage. No new intraparenchymal hemorrhage
identified.

Cardiac ECHO [**2133-3-6**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate aortic regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14611**] was admitted to the ICU for further manegement. His
hospital course by problem is as follows:

1) R Basal Ganglia bleed:Felt to be due to untreated
hypertension.
Mr. [**Known lastname 14611**] remained very hypertensive during his initial course,
and he was treated with IV antihypertensives.  The patient was
transitioned to PO blood pressure medications including
hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol and lisinopril.  A CTA was done
to look for an underlying AVM or aneurysm as he could not get an
MRI. This study showed no vascular anomaly. His other secondary
stroke risk factors including LDL and A1c were checked and were
WNL. It was felt that the mechanism for his bleed was likely
hypertensive. He was gradually started on standing metoprolol
which was titrated. He was also treated with Mannitol to reduce
the intracerebral edema. This was tapered on day #4. He was also
treated with thiamine. He was ruled out for an MI with CE on
admission and a TTE was done which showed LVH.

He was initially started on dilantin. This was stopped, however
several days into his course, he was noted to have shaking
movements. He was therefore restarted on Dilantin and then
transitioned to Keppra for relative thrombocytopenia.
