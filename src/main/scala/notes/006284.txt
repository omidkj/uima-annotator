Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2185-11-25**] 6:29 AM
The ET tube tip remains in unchanged standard position. The
right PICC line tip terminates in mid SVC. The heart size is
enlarged but unchanged. The sternal wires are intact. There is
some improvement in the previously demonstrated pulmonary edema.
The bilateral pleural effusions are grossly unchanged as well as
bibasilar atelectasis.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2185-11-22**] 1:04 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
.
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2185-11-24**] 5:47 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study without intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
2. No evidence of significant bowel obstruction.
3. Small free fluid along the right paracolic gutter inferior to
the cecum.
4. No free air.
5. Bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar consolidations,
most likely due to atelectasis.
6. High density in IVC, right iliac and common femoral vein
worrisome for thrombosis.
.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2185-11-24**] 5:46 PM
IMPRESSION: Air-fluid level in the sphenoid sinus on the right
and complete opacification of the left sphenoid sinus with
aerosolized secretions, most likely representing acute
sinusitis.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) PORT  [**2185-11-24**] 9:51 AM
IMPRESSION:
Distended loops of the entire large bowel. Diagnostic
considerations include a distal obstruction, ileus, and less
likely toxic megacolon (given that haustral folds appear normal.
.
CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**2185-11-13**] 5:56 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-operative scan demonstrate a posterior fusion of C2
through C5 with no evidence of abscess.
2. Lung apices demonstrate consolidation in the right middle
lobe which will be further commented on dedicated chest CT.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The small fluid collection in
the surgical site posterior to the spine appears somewhat larger
than on the cervical spine CT of [**2185-10-31**]. The collection is
poorly evaluated on both studies due to overlying artifact from
the fusion hardware. It may be better analyzed with MR imaging.
However, the apparent enlargement raises a concern of a CSF leak
or an abscess. There is no evidence of an enhancing rim on this
examination. However, this area is so obscured by artifact that
enhancement would be difficult to detect if present
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2185-11-13**] 5:18 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Right upper, mid and bibasilar consolidation concerning for
aspiration versus multifocal pneumonia. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
3. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
4. Diffuse stranding in the soft tissues consistent with
anasarca
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2185-11-13**] 4:18 PM
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity which may represent
atelectasis or pneumonia, but unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo with quadriplegia from recent MVA, ventilator dependent,
now p/w multifocal pneumonia.
.
# Sinusitis:  Although the patient was treated for a full course
of antibiotics for VAP, he still had refractory fevers.  After
scanning of the sinuses and abdomen, it was determined that the
patient had acute sinusitis that was likely causing temperature
spikes.  He had his medication changed to Levofloxacin and was
treated concominantly with Afrin and Nasal saline.  After these
measures were taken the patient remained afebrile.
.
# Multifocal PNA: The patient was started on broad coverage with
Vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected ventilator associated
pneumonia.  The patient fever curve trended downward through the
course of his hospital stay and he received frequent suctioning
to reduce recurrent aspiration.  After sputum cultures grew out
pansensitive Klebsiella oxytoca and pansensitive E. coli,
antibiotic therapy was switched to Ceftriaxone for a full
course.  CXRs revealed moderate improvement in his lung fields,
although had constant small pleural effusions.
.
C.diff - The patient was having fevers refractory to Ceftriaxone
and the patient was also having some abdominal distension.  He
was started empirically on Flagyl and is to finish a 14 day
course of this medication.  The patient had stool studies
obtained and has had 3 negative for C. diff.  The abdominal
distension was thought to be due to constipation, and this
resolved after institution of an aggressive bowel regimen.
.
Fluid collection at surgical site - As the patient was having
fevers despite antibiotic therapy, he had a CT that revealed an
accumulation of fluid at the surgical site.  This was initially
thought to be a CSF leak or an abscess as his fevers were
intermittent, but it was thought that this collections was a
likely due to post-operative changes.  He had his neck re-imaged
and there was no interval change suggestive of a constant CSF
leak or abscess formation/growth.
.
# Respiratory failure:  This patient is ventilator dependent
since the MVA, and given his phrenic nerve paralysis he is
exempt from typical weaning protocol, and the patient was
maintained on a PEEP of 5 while in house.  A wean was
nonsuccessful and this can be attempted while at rehab. However,
the patient was given PSV sprints and he was also able to
tolerate cuff deflation in order to phonate.
.
# Quadriplegia: The patient was maintained on his current care
regimen consisting of PT and skin prophylaxis.  These are
