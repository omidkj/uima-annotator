Brief Hospital Course:
54 y/o female with CAD, mechanical AVR, MVannuloplasty, on
coumadin, who was admitted for pain control s/p fall with
hospital course c/b hypotension and hematocrit drop of unclear
etiology requiring [**Name (NI) 153**] overnight observation. Subsequently
remained hemodynamically stable.

1. Hypotension: On admission the patient was found to have a
blood pressure in 100's systolic. She was otherwise asymptomatic
(no lightheadedness, dizziness, dyspnea or chest pain). However,
of concern is that she normally has poorly controlled
hypertension and she remained with low systolic BP's off all
anti-hypertensives. Aggressive work up was performed to rule out
bleed given her recent fall. She was guaiac negative on exam. CT
scan of the thigh and pelvis were performed which showed no
evidence of bleed. CT head on admission was also negative for
bleed. It was suspected that her hypotension might be secondary
to opiate analgesics she recieved on admission, therefore opioid
analgesics were discontinued. However BP's remained low. SBP
decreased to the 80's-90's and she was given NS prn boluses to
maintain BP >100. She initially responded well to boluses, but
SBP then fell to 70's systolic. During her hospitalization, her
BPs remained on the low side and required prn NS boluses. Her
hematocrits were also being followed. Afternoon of [**2-17**], patient
was found to have a SBP 70s. Patient awake/alert but diaphoretic
and given 250cc NS bolus. Had an EKG which showed a new RBBB.
Right femoral line placed and given 2L NS but SBP remained in
the 80s with good UOP (1000cc after foley placed). Given her
history of significant cardiac disease and new RBBB, cardiology
was consulted and a stat bedside echo was performed to r/o
cardiogenic shock, which was unchanged from prior echo. Pt was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hemodynamic monitoring.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], hematocrit that was checked showed drop 29.7 to
25.9. Etiology of hematocrit drop was unclear as on admission
patient had full work up which was negative for hematoma. [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
team wanted to perform an NG lavage to r/o GI bleed, but patient
did not want this done. She was transfused 1 upRBC. (Of note,
she developed T 103 mid-transfusion; blood was sent for
transfusion reaction. She was later transfused a full unit of
RBCs). Despite low BPs, patient continued to mentate and have
brisk UOP, suggesting adequate end organ perfusion. She had a
[**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test to r/o adrenal insufficiency as cause for her
hypotension, which was normal. Pt did have a mild temperature
and sepsis was entertained as possible etiology of hypotension.
CXR showed vague RLL infiltrate, and she was started on empiric
vancomycin/levofloxacin pending culture data. She remained
stable overnight, with stable blood pressure and hematocrit and
was transferred back to the medicine service.

On return to the medicine service her blood pressures gradually
normally, trending upwards to 120's systolic of
anti-hypertensives. Her blood pressure meds may be re-started as
outpatient as her BP/HR tolerates. She subsequently remained
afebrile and HD stable, with cultures negative, suggesting
against infectious etiology of her hypotension. In addition,
repeat CXR PA and Lat showed resolution of vague RLL infiltrate.
Vancomycin was discontinued and she will complete a seven day
course of levofloxacin on [**2-24**].

2. Anemia- The patient has a noted history of hemolysis
secondary to mechanical valve. Her LDH on admission was mildly
elevated w/ Haptoglobin less than 20. However, her levels were
not significantly elevated from baseline to suggest this as the
cause of her acute hematocrit drop. As mentioned she had no
evidence of bleed by multiple CT studies. Her hct drop may have
been dilutional secondary to recieving aggressive IVF repletion
with her hypotension. Following her transfusion in the ICU, her
hematocrit remained stable at 30 and she required no further
transfusions.

3. Mechanical AVR-Given her risk of thrombosis, in setting of no
obvious bleeding, she was re-started on anti-coagulation. She
was started on IV heparin since her INR was sub-therapeutic and
she was continued on this until her INR was greater than 2 on
coumadin.

4. CAD- Known CAD s/p CABG with recent Cath in [**9-1**] with stents
X 4 to RCA/RPDA. She had a new RBBB seen on EKG but stat ECHO
showed
