Hepatitis B/C who presented with hemoptysis and now transferred
from CSRU with strep pneumonia. He presented to [**Hospital **] clinic

Cardiac Risk Factors: +Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension
.
Cardiac History:
1. Coronary artery disease
- s/p anterior ST elevation MI in [**4-/2112**]
- s/p coronary angiography demonstrating a mid LAD occlusion
with
filling via collaterals.
He was treated medically because of the presumed chronic nature
of the LAD occlusion.
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30% and anterior
/anteroseptal
akinesis
3. Moderate mitral regurgitation.


Social History:
- Pt currently using [**3-27**] cig/day with a 35 PPY history
- Per chart there is history of alcohol abuse; per pt sober
since age 15 yo.

not
recently seen.

Family History:
M - died of lung cancer when he was 3 yo
F - murdered when he was 7

Physical Exam:
VS: T 98.9, BP 124/66, P71, R 20, 97% on RA. FSG 107
Gen: Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NC/AT. MMM, OP clear
CV: RRR S1 S2 soft SM at apex; heart sounds overall difficult to
hear
Chest: + crackles in left post lung fields (mid-lower), few in R
lateral fields. no wheeze/rhonchi
Abd: Obese, soft, NT/ND. c/o diffuse R sided TTP (but states
always feels like that) occ voluntary guarding, no rebound. L
side soft, NT. Tympanic to percussion. No HSM by percussion
Ext: No pitting edema, warm, LLE shorter than right. Pt unable
to bend LLE due to lack of patella.


Pertinent Results:
Micro data: BAL [**10-5**]: E.coli (pansensitive except R to levoflox)

S. pneumo
Fungal cx prelim negative
AFB smear negative, Cx pending
Blood Cx [**10-6**] NGTD
.
Studies:
Bronchial washings/path: neg for malignant cells
.
CT chest noncontrast ([**10-4**]): 1. Interval progression of right
middle and left lobe ground-glass and nodular opacities. There
are also new nodules in the right lower lobe. While these could
represent infectious/inflammatory process or pulmonary
hemorrhage, malignancy such as bronchoalveolar carcinoma should
also be considered.
2. Secretions versus blood products in the dependent aspect of
distal airways.
3. Coronary arterial calcifications.
4. Hepatic cirrhosis; splenomegaly and varices - findings
compatible with portal hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 M with CAD, CHF, h/o hemoptysis; admitted for septic symptoms
following bronch; found to have S.pneumo/E.coli PNA.
.
#) CAP/sepsis: He had bronchoscopy as above and BAL from RML
grew S. pneumo and E.coli. After becoming febrile and
hypotensive, he was transferred to the CSRU.  Zosyn and
vancomycin were started in the CSRU.  With further culture data
he was switched to PO Augmentin for a total of a 10 day course.
Blood cultures were negative.  Pneumovax was given.
.
#) Hemoptysis:  The most likely etiology was his pneumonia as
above; however, he should get further workup as an outpatient
once his acute illness is over to r/o possible malignancy.
Bronchoalverolar carcinoma could not be ruled out from CT.  No
endobronchial lesions were seen on bronch this admission. Bronch
washings were negative for malignant cells.
.
#) CAD s/p MI: He was supposed to be going for CABG; this was
held for hemoptysis evaluation and acute illness.  This now
needs rescheduling.  He will followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] next
month.  We continued his aspirin, beta blocker, ACE, statin, and
nitrate.
.
#) CHF: There were no signs of overt volume overload. We
continued his beta blocker and ACE inhibitor and kept him on a
low sodium diet.
.
# Hep B, C: no active issues.
.
# h/o IVDU: Methadone was continued.
.
# Depression: He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for consult in CSRU. He has
capacity to make decisions.
.
# Diabetes: Overall well controlled here.  Continued on his home
regimen of Lantus as well as sliding scale insulin.
.
# Hypertension: Continued Toprol, Lisinopril and Imdur.
