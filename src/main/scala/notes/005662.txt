breath. History obtained per medical records from outside
hospital. He was given nebs and lasix with little improvement.
Also complained of chest pain on initial presentation. He then
required intubation given tenuous respiratory status. Emergent
bronch was done which demonstrated exophytic mass. Pulm at
outside hospital felt that he needed argon laser therapy and was
thus transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. After intubation and Rt subclavian
central line placement his SBP dropped into the 70-80 range. He
was bolused and started on levophed which was titrated off. He
was also given azithromycin, vanco, and ceftrizaxone and high
dose steroids for possible PNA dn COPD exacerbation.

ECG- NSR at 98, borderline RAD, IVCD, significant artifact in V2
thus this lead is uninterpretable, Twave inversion in inferior
leads, Twave flattening in lateral leads. No olds for
comparison.

CXR- outside report- Right subclavian in good position.
Infiltrates in right mid/lower lobes
.
CXR- Bilateral lower lobe infiltrates Rt>Lt. Bilateral hilar
fullness. ETT 8cm above carina. Right subclavian in SVC.


Bronch [**2122-3-17**]: Large fungating papillary mass, suggestive of
papillomatosis involving L mainstem and L arytenoid.


Brief Hospital Course:
 82 yo M with COPD/asthma presents with respiratory failure,
probably due to COPD/papillomatosis.
.
Respiratory Failure- Appeared to be multifactorial from
multifocal pneumonia in RLL field, COPD, and obstructing mass in
bronchi.
OSH culture = Moraxella, beta-lactamase producing.  Was started
on CTX/Azithro, and vanco was added.   Aggressive
Bronchodilators, steroid taper was also begun.
Bronchoscopy by IP showed mass to be pappilomatosis, caused by
HPV.  They removed the largest of the masses, and referred the
patient to
.
 Hypotension- Occurred after intubation in the setting of
sedation and mechanical ventilation. Also concern for septic
picture given possible pneumonia and elevated WBC. However
hypotension likely related to sedation and autoPEEP
levophed was started for MAPs<65 -> Off [**2122-3-16**].

On hospital day 4, the patient developed tachycardia with an
atrial fibrillation rhythm.  Attempts were made to decrease his
heart rate with lopressor and diltiazem.  His blood pressure
began to drift slowly down, and amiodarone was begun to try to
chemically convert him to a sinus rhythm.  On the amiodarone
bolus, his blood pressure dropped to the 60s for 15 minutes.
The amio was stopped.  Nor-epinephrine was started, with no
effect.  Levophed was then begun, with a rise in his blood
pressure.  A few hours later, on HD 5, the patietn's blodd
pressure again dropped and he developed bradycardia.  A short
period of CPR was begun, with return to a perfusing rhythm.  The
patient's family decided at this time that the patient would not
wish to be maintained on the ventilator or have CPR performed.
Pressors were maxed out, and when this appeared to be
unsuccessful, the patietn was  extubated at the wishes of his
family, and he expired 20 minutes later.
