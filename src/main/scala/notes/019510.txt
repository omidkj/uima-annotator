Service: MED

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
On intial presentation, abdominal pain.  Transferred to us for
possible stenting of L mainstem bronchus occluded by SCC of the
lung.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-4**].
Tracheal intubation [**9-4**], with extubation [**9-5**].

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 51 y.o. male with a history of heavy alcohol
abuse, admitted [**8-27**] to [**Hospital 11485**] Hospital with abdominal pain
and found to have pancreatitis with lipase 560.  The same day,
he was found to have a L lung whiteout on CXR, further evaluated
with chest CT which showed a L hilar mass with pleural effusion.
 On [**8-29**] the patient was going to have a bronchoscopy, but went
into AF with RVR 180, BP 80/40.  He was transfered to the ICU,
started on a diltiazem drip, and went back into NSR within a few
hours.  On [**8-30**] he had a brochoscopy which showed a mass just
below the carina and a complete obstruction of the L mainstem
bronchus 2-4 cm below the mass.  Tissue biopsy showed SCC, and
patient was transferred to us for possible stenting.

The patient says he drinks about 12 beers a day.  His pain
resolved while at [**Hospital1 11485**] after being NPO for two days.  He had
one episode of pancreatitis 15 years ago, and another in [**2195**].

The patient denies any SOB, CP, HA, N/V/D.  He does note a 27
pound weight loss since the winter.  No dysphagia.  He has a
chronic cough with some wheezing, without hemoptysis.  Clear
white sputum.

Past Medical History:
Esophagitis
Alcoholic hepatitis
Pancreatitis
Cholelithiasis
Etoh abuse

Social History:
Patient is divorced, but still lives with his wife and 3
children.  They live in [**Location (un) 22201**], near [**Location (un) 5583**] Mass.  He is
still working as an extruder operator.  When he first moved here
from Poland in [**2162**] he worked for three years on a tobacco farm.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CT torso [**2199-9-2**] -
1) 3.2x3.9 cm hilar mass with extension into subcarinal area,
causing complete collapse of the L lung and a large pleural
effusion.  Exact borders of pulmonary mass can't be visualized
due to lack of IV contrast, but a rough estimate is given at 7.4
x 7.0 cm.
2) Subcentimeter R middle lobe lung nodule
3) Small R pleural effusion
4) Pancreatic calcifications consistent with chronic
pancreatitis
5) Chronic calcifications consisten with splenic granulomas

CT head [**2199-9-2**] -
Negative unenhanced head CT.  MRI with gadolinium would be
helpful if there is clinical suspicion of metastases.  Cavum
spetum pellucidum.

Bronchoscopy [**2199-9-4**] - 100% obstruction left main bronchus with
tumor.

Micro:
[**2199-9-3**] BCx: Strep pneumoniae 2/4 bottles.  Sensitive to
Ceftriaxone, penicillin, erythromycin, levofloxacin,
tetracycline, TMP-SMX, vancomycin.
[**2199-9-3**] UCx: Contaminated.
[**2199-9-5**] BCx: Pending.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 51 y.o. male transferred from [**Hospital1 11485**] with L mainstem
bronchus complete obstruction secondary to SCC, originally
admitted for acute pancreatitis.

1) Airway:  The patient was seen by interventional pulomonology
on arrival, who recommended a CT scan with contrast to stage the
carcinoma prior to stenting, as if the patient were low stage he
may be a surgical candidate rather than palliative, which is
what stenting would accomplish.  Unfortunately, the patient has
a prior history of a contrast allergy, therefore we performed
the CT scan without contrast.  It demonstrated a large pleural
effusion on the L side, with a rim of cortex, with complete
collapse of the left lung and a large hilar mass.
Interventional pulmonology attempted a thoracentesis, however
the effusion was extremely thick and bloody, and no aspirate was
obtained.  He was taken to the OR for rigid bronchoscopy with
possible stenting on [**9-4**], however during the course of the
procedure the patient desaturated to 70 percent, most likely
secondary to laryngospasm, and required intubation.  Stenting
was unable to be performed, as the lumen was completely
obstructed without a patent airway distally.  The patient was
transfered to the MICU post intubation, and remained intubated
for less than 24 hours, being successfully extubated on the
morning of [**9-5**].  Post-extubation he was stable, with a HR in
the 80s, BP 104/57, RR in the 20s, with 93% saturation on room
air.

We have spoken with the patient about the option of thoracotomy
with decortication, however the patient is currently refusing
any operative procedures, and wants to go back to [**Hospital1 11485**] for
any further care.  He may, however, consider it in the future.
It is currently unclear whether the thick material occupying his
thoracic cavity is tumor or empyema.

As far as staging goes, the CT scan performed at our hospital
did not have contrast, and therefore is not a great study for
evaluating for metastases.  It showed results as described in
the Pertinent Results section.  Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 57786**] has an
elevated ALP level in the 200s, without transaminase elevation,
in addition to an elevated GGT.  This could indicate hepatic
involvement.

2) Streptococcal bacteremia:  The patient ran a low grade fever
multiple times duing the course of his stay, with tmax of 102.8
on [**2199-9-3**].  Additionally, wbc increased to 20, and he also
developed a thrombocytosis.  Blood cultures were positive for S.
Pneumoniae, with a likely source being post-obstructive
pneumonia.  He was started on ceftriaxone [**9-4**], pending
sensitivities.  It is pan-sensitive, and he could be switched to
PO Levaquin if desired when he arrives at [**Hospital 11485**] Hospital.  He
has remained afebrile since starting ceftriaxone. Surveillance
blood cultures were drawn on the day of discharge, and are
currently pending.

2) Pancreatitis:  Patient has been without abdominal pain since
[**8-29**], and without tenderness on physical exam.  He has been give
IVF at 150 cc/hr for the duration of his stay, and did not
require any analgesic medication.  He has been able to tolerate
a regular house diet since the night after his arrival.  IVF
were continued throughout since he was NPO for procedures for
much of the time.

3) Etoh:  Patient norma
