History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70223**] 73 M history of CAD sp stent in mid RCA, LAD, L
Circ, PAD who s presented to [**Hospital6 2910**] on
[**2186-5-23**] for SOB.
Pt recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] earlier this year and had
common femoral endarterectomy on left complicated with injury to
vein and subsequent DVT. He was placed on coumadin.
Pt recently reports SOB and presented to OSH where he was found
to have echo revealing EF drop from baseline 30% down to 10%,
progressed aortic stenosis with highly calcified immobile alve
and 0.5cm2 by echo. At OSH he received IV lasix diuresis. He was
given Vit K to reverse coumadin. (U/S showed no acute DVT on
left thigh) He had cardiac cath revealing critical AS with 45mm
peak gradient. No changed with dobutamine. Mid RCA had 80%
lesion and was not stented. Left circ stents widely patent. LAD
stents patent. right ostial left circ lesion proximal to prior
stent. LV function depressed at 20-25% by LV gram with global
moderate hypokinesis, [**12-25**]+MR. Pt also found to have high grade
PAD in right common femoral artery, highly calcified plaque with
100% occlusion after SFA, and profunda femoris high grade
disease. Post-cath BP in the 85-90s.
Pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for consult with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Plan for
aortic valve replacement, CABG. Needs carotid studies and vein
mapping.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient says he is comfortable. Feels
SOB but no different from prior. States he cant walk more then 3
yards without feeling very SOB. This has been occuring since
3/[**2185**]. He also reports productive cough of white sputum that
has been getting progressively worse this past year. Denies any
CP, no palpitations.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis. he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
