Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1850**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty maintaining oxygenation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and ventilation
Bronchoscopy with broncheoalveolar lavage
Chest tube placement for pneumothorax
Transesophageal echocardiography
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
   57 M with COPD and diverticulitis who presented to OSH on
[**2181-1-28**] with 3 days of SOB, cough, elevated WBC count (to 25
with 2% bands up to 8% on same day). In the ER, the patient was
found to be hypotensive, hypoxic and hypercarbic (sats 70% in ED
ABG: 6.99/200/?) and he was emergently intubated.  At OSH, Head
CT negative for bleed; + for sinusitis of maxillary, left
sphenoid, frontal sinuses. He also underwent a spiral chest CT
on admission which was negative for a PE, but positive for an
infiltrate suspicisous for a LLL atelectasis vs PNA, spiculated
LUL nodule, and borderline mediastinal LAD.  Pt grew out H flu
from sputum collected on [**1-28**]. Pt was treated with Levofloxacin,
and ceftriaxone for empiric PNA coverage and steroids for COPD
flare. Transiently on pressors (dopa); weaned off dopa [**1-30**].  Pt
noted to have non-specific EKG changes and ruled in for NSTEMI
with troponin leak, peak 2.52 on [**1-28**]. EKG changes resolved.
[**2-2**] pt noted to have tube feeds suctioned from ETT so
antibiotic coverage broadened to include flagyl. Pt appeared to
be improving over hospital course with resolving acidemia, Ph
7.14/66/413 on [**1-28**]--> 7.32/72/69 on [**2-5**] with decreased PEEP 5,
FiO2 0.5.
No event note found in record, but pt had CT w/ contrast done am
on [**2-5**] which showed 75% collapse of L lung, no evidence midline
shift. Chest tube placed urgently by general surgery with
re-expansion of lung, only 20% residual pneumothorax on CXR post
tube placement.
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern about tension PTX given ?
difficulty oxygenating.

[**2181-2-9**] LE US:
"BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT
Reason: LE SWELLING
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with lower extremity swelling and bilateral
thrombophlebitis per osh report. Please examine both legs for
dvt.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?dvt
STUDY: Doppler ultrasound of lower extremity veins.
INDICATION: Thrombophlebitis. Rule out DVT.
TECHNIQUE: Standard grayscale, pulse wave, and color flow
imaging of the lower extremities were performed.
COMPARISON: No studies available for comparison.

REPORT:
RIGHT SIDE: The right common femoral vein, proximal profunda
femoral vein, great saphenous vein are identified. These are all
patent with normal compressibility, augmentation, and
respiratory variation. The right popliteal vein also
demonstrates normal compressibility, augmentation, respiratory
variation. No evidence of right-sided DVT is seen.

LEFT SIDE: Left common femoral vein is clearly identified and
demonstrates normal compressibility, augmentation, and
respiratory variation. The saphenous vein, popliteal vein,
femoral vein, superficial and deep femoral veins are also all
identified, demonstrate normal color flow imaging,
compressibility, augmentation and respiratory variation..

CONCLUSION:
No evidence of above-knee DVT on either side."

[**2181-2-9**] TTE:
"MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 4.8 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.5 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.8 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): <= 9 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)

INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a
focal LV wall motion abnormality  cannot be fully excluded. No
resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP. Normal mitral valve supporting structures.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal
tricuspid valve
supporting structures. Physiologic TR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views. Suboptimal image quality as
the patient was difficult to position. Suboptimal image quality
- ventilator.

Conclusions:
Images limited to the subcostal window. The left atrium is
normal in size.  Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and systolic function are normal  (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion."
