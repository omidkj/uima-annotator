IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 57-year-old class III obesity, BMI
50 with significant co morbidities and thought to be an
excellent candidate for gastric resection surgery. Risks and
benefits were discussed and patient decided to proceed with
gastric resection surgery. For details of surgery please see
operative note.

Postoperative day #1 the patient had borderline urine output.
She was afebrile, vital signs were stable.  She had only made
273 cc in the operating room and PACU and 41 cc in the last
two hours that were checked.  Her exam was appropriate.  She
was continued on LR with 20 of potassium at 150.  Her NG tube
was discontinued.  She was started on a stage I diet and
encouraged to get out of bed and ambulate.

On postoperative day #2 the patient had a T max of 101.4 and
pulse of 114.  Urine output was adequate.  Her abdomen was
soft and the G tube was in place and incision was clean, dry
and intact.  A hematocrit done on postoperative day #1 was
30.7, potassium 4.8, creatinine 1.2 and on postoperative day
#2 she was considered stable, started on stage II diet and
her IV was Hep-Locked.  She was started on po Lopressor and
Hydrochlorothiazide though urine output was decreased
yesterday and picked up during postoperative day #2 and
continued the Foley to monitor urine output.  She was started
on Roxicet an Zantac po for pain control and prophylaxis
respectively.

On the night of postoperative day #2 to postoperative day #3
resident was called to see patient for left upper quadrant
discomfort, incisional pain and shortness of breath.  At this
point in time patient was afebrile, was making adequate urine
output, had decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally
but otherwise exam was appropriate.  The patient was 92% on
room air and 97% on three liters.  The chest x-ray was done
at that point in time which showed extensive bibasilar
atelectasis and left hemidiaphragm obscured because of
atelectasis.  The patient's respiratory rate was 20.
Respiratory care was called and patient was given a nebulizer
treatment which patient stated she subjectively felt better.
During the day, postoperative day #3, the patient was stating
that she still feels that her breathing was limited but she
denied chest pain in the morning, was afebrile, vital signs
stable, adequate urine output with decreased breath sounds at
the bases.  Abdomen was soft, slightly distended.  She was
continued on Roxicet, continued on pulmonary toilet. Her
Foley was discontinued.  For diabetes she was started on a
regular insulin sliding scale which she had been started on
in the recovery room after surgery.  Her Heparin subcutaneous
was changed to Lovenox.  During the day on postoperative day
#3 the patient started complaining of substernal chest pain
without radiation and slightly increasing shortness of
breath.  She stated that her abdominal pain had decreased
because her G tube was actually placed to gravity. Her vital
signs at this point were stable except her pulse was 129.
She was slightly short of breath and slightly diaphoretic
with decreased breath sounds at the bases.  A Chem 10 done on
that day showed that she had sodium of 137, potassium 4.1,
chloride 88, CO2 23, BUN 19, creatinine .9, glucose 233 and
EKG showed a heart rate of 117 and left bundle branch block
which did not change from her previous EKG except for the
tachycardiac.  Thus, at this time on postoperative day #3 she
had self limited chest pain with continued shortness of
breath and tachycardia.  Cardiovascularly she was ruled out
for an MI with serial enzymes, started on telemetry and her
po Lopressor was changed to IV.  Bec
