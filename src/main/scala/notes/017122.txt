[**1-10**] CXR Large left and moderate right pleural effusions are new
from [**2161**]. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette may indicate a
pericardial effusion. Retrocardiac opacity is concerning for
infection. Irregularity of the left aspect of the trachea may
indicate an invasive lesion. Hilar contours appear normal.

[**1-16**] CXR:
The current study demonstrates unchanged bilateral pleural
effusions and bibasal opacities, left more than right that might
represent a combination of atelectasis and infectious process
potentially hidden by combination of pleural effusion and
atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Note again
is made of the significant deviation of the trachea to the right
with focal narrowing of the AP diameter of the trachea up to 9
mm compared to 24 mm below that point, findings that can be seen
dating back to [**2162-5-7**], but significantly increased since
then and might be consistent with enlarging thyroid lesion in
the left lobe of the thyroid as well as other potentially
present upper mediastinal process, correlation with thyroid
ultrasound and chest CT is highly required . here is no
pneumothorax. There is no interval progression of pulmonary
edema.
.
[**1-10**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There
is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 30-35%). The estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
moderate ([**12-22**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The is mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH with moderate to severe
biventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-5-11**],
right ventricle has dilated. Biventricular systolic function has
significantly deteriorated and there is
