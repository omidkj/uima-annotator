Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for respiratory distress, acute renal failure

endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 yoM w/ a h/o htn, emphysema, EtOH abuse who is
transferred from OSH w/ respiratory distress, pulmonary
infiltrates, ARF, and ? Goodpastures. Upon arrival, patient has
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status and is unable to provide
history.  the following is obtained from the patient's wife and
OSH medical records.  Patient presented to OSH on [**12-9**] w/
complaints of 1 week of progressive SOB. His wife notes that
~1week ago he began a drinking binge.  Over the week, she
reports he has been drinking 24 hours a day, mostly straight
vodka.  She is unable to report exact amounts of intake but has
found empty bottles throughout the house. As the week
progressed, he began to complain of worsening SOB at rest. At
baseline, patient has SOB w/ minimal exertion, sleeps on 3
pillows at night, and uses 2L home O2 at night, sometimes during
the day when his breathing is worse. He does not due stairs and
his wife estimates he would be SOB walking less than a block.
Over the last week, he has required O2 day and night and has
been increasingly restless at night and has been unable to
sleep. She also notes he complained of some chest and epigastric
pain over the last week. He described it as a [**6-16**] on
presentation to OSH. She also notes that patient has a chronic
cough and it has been productive of yellow sputum over the last
week. She thinks he may have had a fever but did not take his
temperature.  He has had a decreased appetite and has been
eating less than usual.  He eats an unhealthy diet at baseline
but has had no significant change in the types of food he's
eaten.  He has had no recent sick contacts or travel.  He had
been constipated for 5 days prior to admission and his wife also
feels that he had decreased UOP over the same time period. He
received the flu shot ~1 month ago.  Per his wife's report, he
has had 2 hospital admissions in the last 2 years for similar
complaints of SOB in the setting EtOH binges although this has
been the most severe.
.
Upon admission to OSH, he was complaining of SOB.  His initial
ABG was 7.38/24/106. He had a CXR performed which reportedly
showed an enlarged heart and pulmonary edema.  His BNP was 530.
His creatinine on presentation was 1.9. He was admitted for
possible CHF exacerbation and ? ACS. He was intially treated w/
NTG gtt. Cardiac enzymes were negative x 2. He was diuresed and
put out ~2L.  He creatinine subsequently rose to 2.4.  He was
also started on Toprol XL and lisinopril for presumed CHF.  He
reportedly had increasing respiratory distress and was
transferred to the MICU.  In the MICU he was briefly on BiPAP
but was quickly weaned to 5LNC w/ O2 sats in [**Doctor Last Name **] low 90s.  His
BPs on the floor were SBPs in 90s-110s but in the ICU his SBPs
were 70s to 90s.  He was not started on any pressors. He had a
PA catheter placed which showed a PCWP of 10.  However, he had 2
ECHOs performed which reportedly showed normal systolic
function. He was diuresed and his renal function continued to
worsen w/ a peak BUN of 77 and creatinine of 3.3. He was started
on moxifloxacin on [**12-10**] for potential pulmonary infection in
setting of productive cough and leukocytosis. Nephrology was
consulted regarding his worsening renal failure.  By report, the
nephrologist did not see any RBC casts or other casts on mico
analysis.  He felt that his ARF was likely prerenal.  Patient
then received some IVF with increase in his UOP. Prior to
transfer he became increasingly disoriented and received a dose
of ativan for ? withdrawal. He also had blood cultures drawn and
received a dose of vancomycin for unclear reasons.

Social History:

son in [**Name (NI) 108**]. Smokes 2.5-3 ppd.  Has smoked for the last 50
years although amount has increased in the last few years. Heavy
EtOH use per his wife.  She reports that he typically has a
drinking binge lasting ~1 wk once a month. He usually begins
with beer and ends with straight vodka.  His binge typically
ends when his breathing gets more severe.  He has been drinking
at this pace for the last 4 years. He has never had any seizures
or DTs per his wife's report.  He has quit drinking for 1 year
in the past w/o incident.

Pertinent Results:
ECG [**12-11**]: NSR @ 90. Low voltage. Nl axis and intervals. LAE. TWF
in aVL. Early repol in V2. No ST/TW abnormalities. Compared to
ECGs from OSH, no sig change.
.
CXR [**12-13**]: There is slight improvement in left lower lobe
opacity, but new large right lower lobe consolidation is
demonstrated suggesting new focus of aspiration given its rapid
appearance. The patient is in mild volume overload but no overt
pulmonary edema is present. The left retrocardiac atelectasis is
unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated
with the right pleural effusion significantly increased since
the previous study, most likely accompanying the new right lower
lobe consolidation.
.
CXR [**12-17**]: In comparison with the study of [**2148-12-16**], the right
hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen and the right lung is actively
clear. Improving atelectatic changes at the left base.
.
Echo: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
diastolic LV dysfunction with elevated filling pressures.
.
Stool studies: C.diff positive
