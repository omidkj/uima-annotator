Admission Date:  [**2185-9-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-9-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2107-11-7**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 78-year-old white
male with a history of known coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction in [**2178**], status post PTCA of the
left anterior descending artery in [**2178**], who subsequently
developed VT with episodes of syncope and had AICD placed in
[**2178**], also with history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes type 2 insulin requiring, who
underwent EP ablation of VT focus today, [**2185-9-5**].

The patient reports having had no chest pain, shortness of
breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, PND, and was doing
well until several months prior to admission.  He was told by
his cardiologist that his ICD device was having to overdrive
pace his ventricle for episodes for ventricular tachycardia.
The patient was unaware of the ventricular tachycardia and
was asymptomatic during episodes.  Then the patient's ICD
device delivered a shock on [**2185-8-12**].  The patient
recalls being asymptomatic prior to defibrillation.  He was
advised by his cardiologist to have an electrophysiological
study with mapping and ablation of his ventricular
tachycardia focus.

The patient underwent mapping and ablation on [**2185-9-5**].
Subsequently, status post ablation, the patient developed a
profuse bleeding and large hematoma formation at his right
groin catheterization site.  At this time, the patient
reported only mild nausea, mild groin and leg pain.  His
femoral catheterization sheath was removed, and direct
pressure was applied to the bleeding site for over two hours.
Throughout this time, his blood pressure remained stable in
the 140s/50s with heart rate in the 60s.  A STAT hematocrit
laboratory value was sent with result of 26.4.  It is unclear
what is the patient's baseline hematocrit.

Vascular Surgery was consulted, and they advised that the
patient be typed and crossed for 4 units of blood, and
transfused 2 units.  In the interim, the patient was sent for
an ultrasound which demonstrated no evidence of
pseudoaneurysm formation at the site of the femoral hematoma.
He was volume resuscitated with 3 liters of IV fluid.  The
bleeding stopped and pressure dressing was applied.

The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
further monitoring.  On arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, he
was pain free.  He denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath, dizziness, back pain, fevers, chills.  He did have
one episode of emesis upon arrival to the unit, but denied
any recurrent nausea.  Repeat hematocrit was sent with a
value of 37.5.  Therefore, the patient was not initially
transfused after arrival to the CCU.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Coronary artery disease:  Patient is status post
myocardial infarction in [**2178**], status post PTCA of the left
anterior descending artery in [**2178**].  He was continued on
medical management with aspirin 325 po q day, Isordil 20 mg
po bid, Lipitor.  His Lipitor dose was increased to 40 mg po
q day and was to be modified after a check of his lipid
profile.  Originally, the patient's ACE inhibitor was held
secondary to his falling hematocrit, the question of any
blood pressure lability.

Patient was not started on a beta blocker secondary to his
history of reactive airway disease.  However, it is felt that
the patient should clarify with his PCP the role of beta
blockade and could perhaps be started on a beta blocker in
the future.  As the patient was status post ablation for
ventricular tachycardia, he is monitored on telemetry for
arrhythmias.  Additionally, he had an ICD in place, which was
functional.

Overnight he had occasional episodes of ectopy with PVCs in
singlets and couplets.  He did not have any runs of
ventricular tachycardia.  On hospital day #2, his verapamil
240 mg po q day and ACE inhibitor were reinstated.  He
remained hemodynamically stable with stable blood pressures
and heart rates.

On hospital day #2, an echocardiogram was done to assess the
patient's left ventricular function and assess for any
valvular abnormalities.  Echocardiogram demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 40%, mild left atrial dilatation.  Mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
severe hypo/akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral
wall and basal inferior wall.  The aortic v
