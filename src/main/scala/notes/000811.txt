Admission Date:  [**2147-10-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2147-11-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2096-9-24**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name 147**]

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease requiring revascularization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old female
with a history of increasing fatigue, increasing dyspnea on
exertion and chest discomfort with known rheumatic fever, who
was admitted for cardiac catheterization on [**2147-10-27**].  This
demonstrated 80% left main coronary artery with moderate
mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was
significant for noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus,
hypertension and rheumatic fever.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications on admission
included Diovan, atenolol, Glucophage, Glucotrol, aspirin,
Lasix, Flonase, iron sulfate and Claritin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had an allergy to Tylenol #3.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was a 51-year-old obese female in no apparent distress.
Neurologically, she was grossly intact.  The lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  The cardiac examination was
significant for an S1 and S2 and a grade II/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  The abdomen was obese and soft with active
bowel sounds.  The extremities were warm with palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and no peripheral edema
noted.

PLAN:  The plan was to perform coronary artery bypass
grafting and mitral valve replacement, which was scheduled
tentatively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for [**2147-10-30**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicine
service.  She stated that she needed a root canal for two
broken teeth.  The oromaxillofacial surgery service was
called and the patient underwent a tooth extraction on
[**2147-10-28**].  She developed chest discomfort that she
associated with the stress of surgery.  Given what appeared
to be angina, she was started on heparin drip.

The patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] on
[**2147-10-30**], where coronary artery bypass grafting times two
was performed as follows:  left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending artery and radial artery to obtuse
marginal artery as well as mitral valve replacement with a
#29 Carbomedics.  The patient was maintained on nitroglycerin
postoperatively in the cardiac surgery recovery unit, given
her radial artery bypass graft.  She did well and was
extubated without complications.  Lasix, Lopressor, aspirin
and Imdur were begun.  Her chest tubes were removed and she
was transferred to the floor.

The patient was doing well on the floor until postoperative
day #2, when she developed rapid atrial fibrillation with a
heart rate in the 160s, requiring intravenous Lopressor for
rate control.  She was also begun on amiodarone.  She was
relatively well rate controlled in a rhythm that alternated
between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter when, on
postoperative day #4, it was noted that the patient had a
long, approximately 4.2 second, pause in which there was no
ventricular response to her atrial flutter.  The cardiology
service was consulted and she subsequently had two further
episodes with syncopal symptoms.

At this time, her amiodarone was decreased and her Lopressor
was stopped.  She was started on a heparin drip, given her
persistent atrial flutter/fibrillation.  Coumadin had also
been started.  The cardiology consultant recommended that the
patient would benefit from pacemaker placement; however, the
patient requested if there were any alternative treatments
and was informed that cardioversion would be an appropriate
second choice to try to disrupt the atrial fibrillation and
see if the patient had persistent pauses post cardioversion.

A transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained to ensure that
there was no clot in the left atrium.  At that time, a
significant clot was found in the left atrial appendage,
which contraindicated cardioversion.  Hence, the patient was
scheduled for pacemaker placement.  Her Coumadin was held.
Once her INR dropped to below 1.8, the patient underwent dual
chamber pacemaker placement with a Medtronics bipolar pacing,
bipolar sensing pacemaker.  She tolerated the procedure well
and was restarted immediately on her Coumadin as well as on a
heparin drip.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was doing well and on
postoperative day #11, given the fact that she was afebrile
with a relatively well controlled heart rate and she was
doing well despite being in persistent atrial
fibrillation/flutter with excellent rate control, that she
would be stable for discharge.  On the day of discharge, the
patient was clear to auscultation and in a regular rhythm.
Her sternum was stable and dry.  Her abdomen was soft.  Her
extremities were well perfused with minimal edema.

DISCHARGE DIET:  The patient was discharged on a cardiac
diet.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times ten days.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times ten days.
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d.
Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
Motrin 600 mg p.o. every six hours p.r.n.
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Sliding scale insulin.
Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.d.
Heparin intravenous drip at 700 units per hour.
Percocet.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The instructions for anticoagulation
were that a target INR of 3 to 3.5 should be attained.  Until
that occurs, heparin should be maintained with a target
partial thromboplastin time of 60 to 80.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is scheduled for a follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in one month and a pacemaker clinic
follow up in one week.  The phone number for the clinic is
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59**].
The patient was instructed
