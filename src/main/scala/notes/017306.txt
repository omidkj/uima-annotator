Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea/vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 98977**] is a 65 yo woman with history of chronic
diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, mixed obstructive and
restrictive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea (uses
CPAP), Type II diabetes, and chronic kidney disease who presents
with 2 days of nausea, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia.

She has had chronic shortness of breath felt to be related to
volume overload from chronic diastolic CHF.  Her metolazone was
increased to 2x/week about 2 weeks ago.  Since then she reports
decreasing weight (has lost about 7 lbs).  One week ago, she
began to develop more fatigue and felt that her legs began to
buckle more frequently.  Also endorses worsening leg cramping.
She has also felt nausea for the last several days and vomited
once two days ago.  She was seen by her PCP yesterday who
checked electrolytes.  She was called by her PCP this morning
due to hypokalemia and hypercalcemia and told to come into the
ED.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.2, BP 181/75, HR 59, RR 18,
O2sat 97% RA.  Lab results were significant for stable troponin
(0.09), K of 2.7, and calcium of 12.5.  In the ED she endorsed
shortness of breath and CXR showed evidence of pulmonary edema.
She received KCl 60 meq po and 40 meq IV, verapamil SR 240 mg po
and Carvedilol 12.5 mg po prior to transfer to the medicine
floor.

Currently she reports feeling tired with slight nausea.  She
reports her breathing feels pretty good.  She feels she can walk
150 feet without getting short of breath, but states her
functional status has declined significantly after a rehab stay
in [**4-2**] after an ankle fracture.

Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI.  Also endorses having chills for 9 months,
intermittent fleeting chest achiness that feels "empty" in
character, also with constipation
(-) Denies fever, headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied diarrhea or abdominal pain. No recent change
in bowel or bladder habits. No blood in stool.  No dysuria.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Studies:

[**2138-7-10**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 60. Intraventricular
conduction delay of left bundle-branch block type. Leftward
axis. Q-T interval prolongation. Generalized non-specific
repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2138-3-16**] Q-T interval prolongation is new and there are
mid-precordial U waves consistent with hypokalemia.

[**2138-7-10**] CXR: Cardiomegaly, mild congestion, trace left pleural
effusion. Nodular opacities in the right mid lung, possibly
representing healing rib fractures, though true pulmonary
nodules cannot be excluded. *****A CT of the chest is
recommended to further evaluate. Findings and recommendations
were communicated with housestaff.*****

[**2138-7-15**] Renal Ultrasound: 1. Right simple renal cysts. 2.
Normal-appearing left kidney. 3. No evidence of obstructive
renal disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 98977**] is a 65 yo woman with history of chronic
diastolic CHF, pulmonary HTN, mixed obstructive and restrictive
pulmonary disease, OSA on CPAP, T2DM, and CKD who presented with
nausea, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia with hospital course
complicated by CCU transfer for bradycardia and hypotension.

#. Hypokalemia: On admission she was hypokalemic to 2.7.  This
was felt to be related to an increase in her metolazone dosing
prior to admission.  Metolazone was held and her potassium was
supplemented and returned to [**Location 213**] range.  She will be
discharged on potassium supplements 20 meq po daily at the
recommendation of the renal team. Patient should have her
electrolytes monitored within one week of discharge.

#. Hypercalcemia: She had hypercalcemia on admission felt to be
related to intravascular volume depletion and increase in recent
metolazone dosing.  She had a normal PTH level. Her calcium
supplements were held, as was her metolazone and she was gently
rehydrate and her calcium levels improved.

#.  Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Due to her electrolyte
abnormalities, she was gently rehydrated with 2 liters of normal
saline over 2 days.  She gradually became short of breath with
this fluid and her oxygenation worsened.  Her Lasix was
restarted in intravenous form and her oxygenation improved.  She
was initially given her home carvedilol and verapamil but then
developed bradycardia so these were held.  She was changed to a
lower dose of verapamil and labetalol.  Her home lasix was
restarted.

#. Syncope and bradycardia: She developed bradycardia to the
40's on [**2138-7-13**] and had an episode of syncope without trauma.
She was found to be in complete heart block with junctional
escape rhythm felt to be due to accumulation of nodal blocking
agents in setting of worsening renal failure.  She became
hypotensive during this episode and she was transferred to the
CCU.  She was placed on a dopamine drip transiently for
hypotension.  Her verapamil dose was decreased and her
carvedilol was switched to labetalol.  Her heart rate
subsequently remained in normal range.

#. CKD Stage IV: Creatinine elevated on admission to 4.4 from
recent baseline of 4.0.   Her cre
