history significant for congestive heart failure with an

a right colectomy in [**12/2194**], who now has an enterocutaneous
fistula that developed since the colectomy.  The patient has
had ongoing infections at the ostomy site and had an ostomy
bag in place.  Surgery was delayed based upon the patient's
poor cardiac status and was finally only done at the behest
of the patient and his wife.

PLAN:  The patient was admitted to undergo repair of his
enterocutaneous fistula.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2197-4-10**], the patient went an
exploratory laparotomy with resection of his enterocutaneous
fistula resulting in an ileocolic anastomosis.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  Please see dictated op note
for details.  The patient went to the ICU postoperatively for
total of three days, where he had an uneventful course and
was gently diuresed.  He continued in atrial fibrillation
throughout his hospital course and that atrial fibrillation
was marked by frequent PVCs and short bursts of PVCs.  The
patient ultimately was placed back on his digoxin and
carvedilol, but as he continued to have these events, his
carvedilol was increased and his digoxin was decreased to the
discharge doses (see below).

On postoperative day four, the patient complained of some
chest pain and shortness of breath, and EKG was therefore
obtained, which showed no acute ischemic changes.  In fact,
there were no changes from his EKG preoperatively.  Patient
nevertheless was continued on telemetry and three sets of
enzymes were obtained, and the patient ruled out for a MI.

The patient's abdominal wounds where the fistulas were were
packed throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course with wet-to-
dry's and remained clean throughout his hospital course.
When the patient was discharged, the fistula sites were to be
changed by VNA twice a day with wet-to-dry's.

On postoperative day six, the patient continued to report no
flatus.  His diet was advanced nevertheless to sips and 2 mg
of Coumadin was started and continued throughout the
remainder of his hospital course.

On postoperative day seven, the patient had some mild
distention, but reported flatus, and was therefore advanced
to clears diet, which he tolerated well.

On postoperative day eight, the patient continued to report
flatus.  He tolerated a regular diet, and was therefore sent
home.  His INR upon discharge was 1, and his Coumadin was
continued at 2 per day.  The patient also had several bowel
movements on the previous day, but on the day of discharge,
that diarrhea had subsided.
