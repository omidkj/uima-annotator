HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old gentleman
with known aortic stenosis and cardiomyopathy who had been
complaining of a several month history of increasing fatigue
and muscle ache with worsening dyspnea on exertion.
Echocardiogram [**2148-7-18**], showed an ejection fraction of
20 percent with a dilated right ventricle, aortic valve area
of 0.8, aortic valve gradient of 80 mmHg, 1 to 2 plus aortic
insufficiency, 1 to 2 plus mitral regurgitation.  The patient
had a cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 205**] which showed aortic
valve area of 0.6 cm squared and aortic valve gradient of 45
mmHg, 2 plus aortic regurgitation, 2 to 3 plus mitral
regurgitation and ejection fraction of 26 percent, global
hypokinesis and a 50 percent mid left anterior descending
coronary artery occlusion and moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
for operative management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Dilated cardiomyopathy.

Atrial fibrillation.

Status post cholecystectomy.

Status post left optic nerve infarct.

Status post hernia repair.

Status post permanent pacer insertion for heart block.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day.
2. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day.
3. Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. day.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is a
retired real estate [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  The patient drinks three to five
alcoholic drinks per week.  He is a remote smoker.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2148-9-15**],
preoperatively for anticoagulation though the patient had
stopped his Coumadin therapy in anticipation of going to the
Operating Room.  Laboratory data was significant for a
hematocrit of 43.8 and INR of 1.3, otherwise unremarkable.
The patient had carotid ultrasound which showed no
significant hemodynamic lesion of the right or left carotid
artery and the patient was taken to the Operating Room on
[**2148-9-17**], by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] where he underwent
aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement and a
Maze procedure.  The aortic valve was a 27 mm pericardial
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] and the mitral valve was 29 mm Mosaic pig
valve.  Total cardiopulmonary bypass time 176 minutes,
crossclamp time 90 minutes.  The patient was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit on epinephrine infusion.

The patient required moderate volume resuscitation
postoperatively with labile hemodynamics and on postoperative
day Number 2 the patient was started on a Milrinone infusion
to improve his hemodynamics with moderate improvement.
Electrophysiology Service was consulted to increase the rate
in his permanent pacemaker to improve his hemodynamics.  The
patient remained intubated.  The patient continued to require
volume resuscitation and increase in his inotropic support
for low cardiac indices.  The patient was started on a
heparin infusion as he was found to be in atrial fibrillation
when his pacemaker was interrogated.  The patient had a
transesophageal echocardiogram on postoperative day Number 4
which showed an ejection fraction of 40 percent, mild local
left ventricular and right ventricular systolic depression,
mild tricuspid regurgitation, stable aortic and mitral
prosthesis.  The patient was started on amiodarone infusion
for control of the atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
still unable to wean from mechanical ventilation, due to his
unstable hemodynamics.  The patient was started on Natrecor
to decrease his pulmonary artery pressures.  On postoperative
day Number 5, the patient spiked a fever to 102.  He was
pancultured.  The patient had blood cultures that were drawn
from his PA catheter which grew gram positive cocci in pairs
and clusters.  The line was removed and resited.  The blood
cultures were eventually one out of four which was coagulase
negative Staphylococcus.  The patient was started on
vancomycin.  The patient was cardioverted from atrial
fibrillation to sinus rhythm with some improvement in his
hemodynamics.  Over the next several days, the patient's
Milrinone was weaned.  The patient remained sedated and
intubated.  The patient was hemodynamic.  The patient had
several more episodes of atrial fibrillation all which caused
increase in his hemodynamics and required cardioversion.

As the patient was unable to be awoken and weaned from the
ventilator by postoperative day Number 10, it was decided
that the patient should undergo a tracheostomy which was done
and a Number 8 Portex Trach was placed.  The bronchoscopy at
that time showed copious thick secretions with edematous
mucosa.  The sputum subsequently grew out methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient continued to
require low dose epinephrine to maintain adequate cardiac
output.  The patient's sedation was gradually weaned with
intermittent increasing agitation and a drop in his
hemodynamics.  By postoperative day Number 17, the patient's
epinephrine had been weaned down and he appeared to be
tolerating it well.  The patient continued on Natrecor,
however, on postoperative day Number 19, it was noted that
the patient had dropping mixing his oxygen saturation and
appeared to be volume depleted.  The patient had all of his
lines changed.  The patient was found to have a continued
drop in hematocrit, and it was realized that the patient had
an increasing abdominal distention.  The patient had a
computerized axial tomography scan of his abdomen which
showed a retroperitoneal bleed.  The heparin anticoagulation
was stopped.  A vascular surgery consult was obtained, and it
was recommended to continue to treat the patient medically.
The measurement of the hematoma was measured at 11 by 11 cm,
extending from the right iliacus muscles to the right psoas
and then extending superiorly with the displacement of the
right kidney anteriorly.  The patient had significant
abdominal distention at this time with concerns for abdominal
compartment syndrome.  The patient had continuous bladder
pressure monitors which remained relatively stable.  However,
the patient's creatinine began to rise with concerns for
renal perfusion.  The patient continued to require blood
transfusions.

A renal consult was obtained and they felt that the rise in
creatinine was due to the patient's acute bleed and volume
depletion, and hypotension requiring pressors.  On
postoperative day Number 22, the patient was noted to have a
drop in his platelet count.  A heparin antibody was sent
which was subsequently negative.  The patient was transfused
platelets as it was felt that he was continuing to have some
bleeding from the retroperitoneal hematoma.  The patient's
creatinine gradually began to decrease over the next several
days.  Critical care consult was obtained for the patient's
failure to wean from the ventilator and continued agitation.
It was recommended that the patient undergo bronchoscopy and
increase some of his ventilator settings.  The patient's
sputum culture continued to grow methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was switched from
vancomycin to linezolid which resulted in a decrease in his
temperature.  The patient's epinephrine over the next several
days was slowly weaned off.  The fentanyl and Versed drips
which had been used for sedation were slowly weaned off.

As the intravenous sedation was weaned off the patient
continued to be more awake and more agitated.  The ventilator
was gradually weaned.  The epinephrine was weaned off by
postoperative day Number 28.  The Natrecor was weaned off by
postoperative day Number 30.  The patient's pulmonary artery
catheter had been removed and his clinical staff indicated
that he was tolerating the wean of his inotrope.  On
postoperative day Number 32, the patient was taken to the
Operating Room for an open gastrostomy tube w
