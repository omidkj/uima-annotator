History of Present Illness:
This 70 year old female with multiple medical issues presented
to the ED with cuts to her legs.  There is a question of
self-inflicted wounds vs. assault.  At the time of EMS arrival
her door was locked from the inside requiring EMS to force
entry.  The patient was found down, responsive, confused, with
no signs of trauma except for the bilateral ankle lacerations,
she was found with large amount of blood on the floor.  No
active bleeding at the time of admission.  She had week pulses
in the ED initially 40/p then up to 80s with IVF.  She was
intubated secondary to nausea/vomiting for airway protection.
She recieved 4 units PRBC and 6 liters IVF, 1 liter LR.  She was
given charcoal for presumed toxic ingestion.  She was admitted
to the T/SICU intubated on PPF and Dopamine.  In the T/SICU she
stabilized.  She was weaned off all drips and extubated the
following AM.  She was then transferred to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
Please see addendum for additional hospital course.
1.  Ankle lacerations - She was evaluated by ortho who advised
that she received a tetanus shot and that the wounds not be
closed when she first arrived.  On the third day of
hospitalization they advised to have the trauma team suture the
wounds.
2.  Increased LFTS - After she was transferred out of the MICU
her LFTs were elevated.  These appeared to be due to shock liver
due to her severe fluid loss from bleeding.  When rechecked
later they had normalized.
3.  CV - Upon tranfer to the floor she was noted to have
crackles throughout her lungs and be SOB.  She had been given a
lot of fluid the prior day.  It was felt that she was in mild
CHF and she was given 20mg Lasix IV with good effect.
4.  Pulmonary - She was noted to be SOB upon transfer to the
floor.  We restarted all of her home asthma medications and
inhalers with good effect.
5.  Psychiatry - The psychiatry team evaluated her while she was
in the MICU and again on the floor.  They initially felt that it
was most likely these wounds were due to assault and not self
inflicted.  However, upon obtaining the police report and with
careful patient questioning, it appeared that the wounds were in
fact self-inflicted.  She will be admitted to a psychiatric
facility.
6.  Her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] and all
of her out-patient medications were restarted.
