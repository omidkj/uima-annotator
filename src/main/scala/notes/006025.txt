Brief Hospital Course:
This is the discharge summary of a patient who expired under the
care of the Trauma Service after a prolonged hospitalization for
multiple severe injuries.  On [**2166-11-20**] she was a restrained
driver in a head-on [**Last Name (un) 8886**] between her car and a
tractor-[**Last Name (un) 28523**].  After a prolonged extrication she was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] where she was found to have the
following injuries:

-thoracic aortic tear at the level of the proximal descending
aorta
-R [**9-20**] rib fracture
-L ischium fracture
-R distal radius & distal ulna fractures
-L 4th metacarpal fracture
-L femur fracture
-L open tibia/fibula fractures

She had multiple surgical procedures throughout her hospital
stay. These included:
[**11-20**]: endovascular stent placed in thoracic aorta. ex-fix L
femur/L tibia, CRPP L metacarpal. closed reduction/splint R
radius/ulna
[**11-24**]: [**Last Name (un) 101**] plate L tibia, [**Last Name (un) 101**] plate L femur, ORIF R distal
radius/ distal ulna, CRPP R MC fx's, R volar orthoplast, L ulnar
gutter orthoplast.
[**11-25**]: IVC filter
[**11-26**]: iliac artery stented. L femoral embolectomy and bovine
patch angioplasty
[**11-28**]: open trach. No PEG [**2-12**] body habitus.
[**12-12**]: removal of femoral bovine patch and replacement with
saphenous vein patch
[**12-23**]: I&D L knee and primary closure, I&D R wrist
[**12-26**]: I&D L abdomen/groin and R wrist
[**1-14**]: I&D L groin, [**Last Name (un) **] and exfix of R wrist
[**1-21**]: partial closure L groin. I&D R wrist. Washout L knee.
[**1-24**]: exploration L groin wound & evacuation of clot.
[**Date range (1) 63248**]: multiple washouts L knee, with ultimate removal of
all hardware and placement of a spanning external fixator, VAC
placement.

Her hospital course was complicated by the following events:
-SEPTIS/PNEUMONIA: Multiple episodes of enterococcal bactermia
and pseudomonal pneumoniam treated with appropriate antibiotics
and resolved.

-HIT+
--found on [**12-2**].
--Received 9 week course of lepirudin gtt anticoagulation.
--Maintained on fondaparinux prophylaxis afterwards.

-POSTERIOR CIRCULATION CVA
--found on [**12-15**]
--neurology consulted, no intervention performed other than
continued anti-coagulation.

-RISING DIRECT BILIRUBIN.
--[**12-4**]: hepatology consulted
--us dopplers: patent vessels, hyperechogenic liver
--[**12-6**]: CT & RUQ US showed no dilated ducts, s/p choly, no
abscesses
--ERCP?
--[**12-7**] GI consulted. Poor ERCP candidate, likely cholestatic
from drug rxn.
--Resolved.

-ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
--early in hospital course had rapid AF --> cardioversion -->
bradycardic arrest --> atropine
--[**2-15**] transferred to SICU for rapid AF with resulting
hypotension. Chemically cardioverted with Amiodarone,
transferred back to floor. She was maintained on amiodarone and
instructed to follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.

-L KNEE WOUND INFECTION: her left knee wound had prolonged
drainage and multiple I+D's after the original ORIF on [**2166-11-24**].
The organisms found on multiple wound cultures were pseudomonas
(ceftazadime sensitive) and MRSA. She had multiple courses of
antibiotics and VAC dressing changes to treat these infections.
Eventually all hardware
