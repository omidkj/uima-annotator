Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lipitor / Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
bradycardia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-8-3**] - Implantation of permanent pacemaker
[**2114-8-7**] - CoreValve (aortic valve) placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 89 year-old Female with a PMH significant for CAD
(with 2-VD on cardia cath without PCI, s/p NSTEMI in [**2111**]),
history of systolic CHF (now EF 60%), HTN, HLD, severe aortic
stenosis (AV gradient 44 mmHg, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.56 cm^2 with valvuloplasty
performed [**1-/2114**]), MR, dementia, hypothyroidism who was recently
scheduled for CoreValve placement (on [**2114-7-31**]) but this was
post-poned given that she experienced a mechanical fall from her
wheelchair on presentation to the hospital. Her walker slipped
backward and her head hit the floor. A CT head was negative. Her
procedure was re-scheduled for [**2114-8-7**], but she presented to
[**Hospital 10478**] [**Hospital3 **]'s ER on [**2114-8-1**] for a syncopal episode and
she was found to be in sinus bradycardia with HR in the 50s.
.
This AM the patient's VNA noted that the patient had some
abdominal discomfort. She started to feel better and went to
move her bowels at 11AM and during Valsalva she developed
lightheadedness and pre-syncopal concerns without LOC or head
injury. EMS responded and the patient was evaluated at
[**Hospital3 13313**] ED where her labs were reassuring, but she
had episodes of sinus bradycardia to the 50s. She was without
further lightheadedness, dizziness or chest pain.
.
Of note, she was initially thought to be too fragile and her
dementia too severe for her to unfergo CoreValve placement, but
by her [**2114-7-6**] appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], she had markedly
improved and was reconsidered for the CoreValve procedure.
.
The patient's most recent hospital admission was on [**2114-6-27**] to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for chest pain attributed to demand ischemia from
her severe aortic stenosis. She was discharged on [**2114-6-29**] with
her previous cardiac medications and the addition of Lasix 20 mg
PO twice daily.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is without chest pain or
trouble breathin. She has no nausea or vomiting, no abdominal
complaints. She denies lightheadedness or dizziness.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep
venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. They deny bleeding at
the time of prior procedures or surgeries. Denies headaches or
vision changes. No cough or upper respiratory symptoms. Denies
chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.
Denies shortness of breath. No nausea or vomiting, denies
abdominal pain. No dysuria or hematuria. No change in bowel
movements or bloody stools. Denies muscle weakness, myalgias or
neurologic complaints. No exertional buttock or calf pain.
