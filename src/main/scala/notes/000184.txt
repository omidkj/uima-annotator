Right lower lobe Efusion

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 22703**] is a 61M with a PMHx of AFib and non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy who has been transfered from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] for
evaluation and management of his ongoing pulmonary issues.  He
initially presented there in [**8-30**] with a cough productive of
yellow sputum and fevers to 101.5.  He was treated for PNA and
discharged to home on a course of cefpodoxime and azithromycin.
On that admission he was found to be supratherapeutic on his
coumadin to an INR of 3.1 secondary to the antibiotics and
adjustments to his regimen were made for the duration of the
course.  The patient states that he never really felt any better
and continued to have a productive cough, intermittent
hemoptysis and fatigue, though he did return to work.  On [**10-16**]
he saw his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] felt that there was radiographic
improvement, but prescribed a course of clarithromycin and
steroids for persistent cough.  Over the course of the night the
patient states that his cough was much worse and he went to the
[**Location (un) 620**] ED.  He was admitted and started on Vanc and Zosyn.  CT
showed a large loculated R pleural effusion as well as a new
nodule on the left (comp CCT [**3-29**]).  Thoracentesis was performed
[**10-18**] and 200cc of bloody fluid was drawn and sent for analysis.
 The decision was made to transfer him to our service for
possible surgical
management.  The patient reports no history of trauma, no sick
contacts, no recent travel history, no history of exposure to
tuberculosis (last PPD 20 years ago--neg).

CXR: [**2152-10-24**] IMPRESSION: Interval removal of two of three
right-sided chest tubes. No pneumothorax.  Persistent
right-sided pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.

Chest CT w/contrast [**2152-10-19**]: FINDINGS: There is a loculated
right pleural effusion with resulting right lower lobe and right
middle lobe collapse. Minimal atelectasis in the left lower lobe
and linear atelectasis in the left upper lobe. There is an 11 mm
x 9 mm nodule in the left upper lobe (image 14, series 2). There
is an additional nodule in the left upper lobe measuring 10 mm x
6 mm (image 18, series 2). There is a right hilar mass 4.5 cm x
2.7 cm x 2 cm. There is resulting narrowing of the bronchus
intermedius and right middle lobe bronchus. There is thickening
of the posterior wall of the bronchus intermedius. There is a
subcarinal lymph node measuring 8 mm x 13 mm. There are right
hilar lymph nodes measuring 15 mm x 18 mm.






Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22703**] was admitted on [**2152-10-18**] for a persistent right
lower lobe effusion. He was continued on his antibiotics
Vancomycin, Zosyn and prednisone. On [**2152-10-19**] he had Thoracic
ultrasound showed a moderate-sized pleural effusion  which was
visualized mostly at the posterior back of the hemothorax just
at the paraspinal area. The fusion seems loculated and not
free-flowing as the anterior part of the
hemothorax very tiny effusion could be visualized, which was
drained for 200 mL of serosanguineous effusion. A chest CT
w/contrast revealed a loculated right pleural effusion with
resulting right lower lobe and right middle lobe collapse.   On
[**2152-10-20**] he was taken to the operating room for successful
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and active
brushings and right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery total
pulmonary decortication.  He was extubated in the operating
room, monitored in the PACU prior to transfer to the floor.  The
3 chest-tubes remained on suction x 48 hrs, a foley to gravity
and Dilaudid PCA for pain.  On POD1-2 his diet was restarted,
the foley was removed and he voided without difficulty.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebs were continued.  Chest film
