Date of Birth:   [**2090-5-23**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU [**Location (un) **]

ADDENDUM:  This discharge summary will cover the events for
Ms. [**Known lastname **] hospital course from [**2163-2-15**] through
discharge.

IMPRESSION:  Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] is a 72-year-old female transferred
to the [**Hospital6 256**] after a full
month progressive decline in functional status,
neurovegetative symptoms, intermittent pneumonia, and fevers
with an exhaustive evaluation revealing only an elevated ESR,
anti double-stranded DNA, and [**Doctor First Name **].  Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on three separate
occasions for respiratory arrest and subsequently PA arrest.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  RESPIRATORY ARREST:  Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] had
been initiated on electroconvulsive treatments for depression
as her other workup had been negative.  Prior to the
patient's ECT treatment on [**2163-3-2**], she was noted to
have a cough and then turned blue.  She received no meds,
shocks, or ECT prior to this event.  An anesthesiologist was
on hand and intubated the patient within minutes prior to the
arrival of the code team.  The patient remained in normal
sinus rhythm throughout.  She also remained hemodynamically
stable.

She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and
was quickly extubated the following day.  The patient's five
day Medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable for
several episodes of multifocal atrial tachycardia.  On
several occasions, the multifocal atrial tachycardia resolved
on its own.  During several of these episodes her blood
pressures dropped from the systolic 120s to systolic in the
60s.  The blood pressure changes were dynamic in relation to
the patient's rates.  On several further occasions of
hypotension with development of MAP, the patient received
Lopressor boluses with resolution of her MAP and control of
her hypotension.

During this aspiration event leading to her MICU admission,
she had been treated for her presumptive aspiration pneumonia
with Aztreonam and vancomycin.  These medications were
continued for 72 hours and discontinued because the patient's
sputum cultures remained negative.

Miss [**Known lastname 18741**] was returned to the medical floor on [**2163-3-6**], upon which she began ECT once again and was started on
steroids for empiric treatment of her inflammatory condition.

On [**2163-3-10**], at 4:55 a.m., a code blue was called and
the patient was found to be in PA arrest.  She was intubated
and amounts of solution and secretions were immediately
suctioned.  She received three amps of bicarbonate, three
amps of epinephrine, and two amps of Atropine and converted
into ventricular fibrillation.  She received nonsynchronized
DCCV and converted to sinus rhythm at 5:07 a.m.

She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit once
again.  She remained intubated until [**2163-3-16**], at which
time she underwent a tracheostomy.  The following day, the
patient tolerated a tracheal tent with decreasing levels of
FI02.  Prior to discharge, the patient had tolerated tracheal
tenting for more than 24 hours.  Her gas (arterial blood) on
tracheal tent with an FI02 of 0.4 was 7.43/51/111.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 18741**] required mechanical ventilation once again, this
would be in accordance with her plan of care and with the
family's wishes despite her DNR status.

Upon readmission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she was
noted to have MSSA positive sputum culture and she was
treated for presumed pneumonia initially with vancomycin
which was converted to Oxacillin upon the return of the
sensitivities, and subsequently changed to Unasyn for
coverage of a VRE UTI as well.  The patient should remain on
Unasyn for a 14 day total course, last dose to be
administered on [**2163-3-30**].

2.  NEUROLOGIC:  Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] was noted to have a moderate
amount of improvement while receiving ECT.  Upon extubation
on her first MICU stay, she was alert and responding
appropriately to questions.  However, upon her resuscitation
from the PA arrest on [**2163-3-10**], her level of neurologic
function was severely diminished.  It was felt that she
suffered a significant anoxic brain injury.

The Neurology Service was consulted and had recommended an
EEG.  The EEG performed on [**2163-3-10**] demonstrated a
burst suppression pattern which was a poor prognostic sign.
The only level of neurologic function she demonstrated
initially was over breathing the ventilator.  An apnea test
demonstrated that she had one breath within 45 seconds.  Up
until the time of discharge, the patient's pupils remained
nonreactive to light, no gag reflex, no dolls eyes, no
withdrawal to pain.

The neurologic consultant indicated that out of 100 patients
with similar findings on examination after an anoxic brain
injury with the EEG pattern, zero would have a chance of
expecting even just a moderate degree of disability in the
long-term prognosis.

The patient was continued with supportive care for this
neurologic injury.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] was noted to have a history
of CHF with an ejection fraction of 55%.  This was felt to be
significant for diastolic failure.  She had several episodes
of decompensated congestive heart failure while in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She responded well to Lasix
boluses with significant diuresis and subsequent improvement
in her oxygen saturation and clinical examination.  Her
fluids were repleted at reduced rates secondary to her
tendency to present in CHF.

4.  HISTORY OF MAT:  Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] has a history of MAT, which
upon admission was controlled with verapamil.  She had been
changed to Lopressor with adequate control of her MAT during
her first admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Status post her PA arrest, the patient had several episodes
of MAT which was recalcitrant to beta blockade.  She had been
placed on a Diltiazem drip on [**2163-3-12**].  This was
converted to an oral dose of Diltiazem with excellent control
of her MAT.  The Diltiazem was titrated up and she will be
discharged on 60 mg of Diltiazem q.i.d.  Of note, the patient
is unable to have an extended release form as she receives
all of her p.o. medications through the PEG tube.

5.  ACID BASE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] has had several acid base
disturbances during her two Intensive Care Unit admissions.
She had a respiratory acidosis with compensation, metabolic
alkalosis during her first Intensive Care Unit stay.  She
subsequently developed a primary metabolic alkalosis with
respiratory acidotic compensation.  The metabolic alkalosis
was secondary to contraction as she had an elevated BUN to
creatinine ratio status post her PA arrest.  Urine
electrolytes were pending at the time of this dictation.

As noted in her last ABG above, the patient was able to
compensate well on a tracheal tent for her metabolic
alkalosis.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Initially, the patient had been
resistant to placement of an NG tube or PEG tube status post
her first respiratory arrest.  The patient's husband and the
patient consented to a PEG tube placement for malnutrition.
The PEG tube was placed on [**2163-3-9**] without
complication.  During her second Intensive Care Unit
admission, the patient was continued on tube feeds at goal.
The patient also had a repeat bedside swallow evaluation on
[**2163-3-8**] which demonstrated evidence of aspiration at
the bedside after all boluses were complete.  It was also
noted during the previous study that the patient had no
spontaneous cough when she aspirated, although on the current
study the patient has a significant cough, although it was
unclear or not that was related to aspiration events as she
was noted to be a silent aspirator in the past.

After the placement of the PEG tube, the patient was to be
given oral supplements only for palliation.

7.  RENAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] renal function had remained within
normal limits until she was status post the PA arrest.  She
had a bump in
