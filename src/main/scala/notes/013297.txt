Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo woman with pulmonary fibrosis and COPD
on transtracheal home oxygen (3-4L) and chronic prednisone (10mg
po daily) who was admitted to the MICU on [**2136-6-6**] for
worsening dyspnea and hypoxia after elective bronchoscopy
earlier that day.  She was admitted in [**Month (only) 958**] (~6 wks prior to
this admission) to an OSH for exacerbation of her shortness of
breath and was discharged to a rehab facility.  Previously, she
had been the primary caretaker for her ill husband, and reports
being able to perform household chores and climb the stairs in
her house, though believes this "wore her out."
.
Because of the six weeks of worsening dyspnea and two days of
increased cough productive of prurulent sputum (which coincided
with an episode of prolonged epistaxis c/w prior history, though
patient denies any link to her SOB), she was scheduled for
elective bronchoscopy on day of admission.  Per IP notes, there
was no bloody secretions in the airways, minimal clear
secretions and no endobronchial lesions.  Pt was monitored post
procedure without event and was transferred back to the rehab
where she and her husband have been living for the last 2
months.  On return to rehab, husband was concerned that she was
increasingly SOB and O2 sats dipped into the 70s.  Husband spoke
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who recommended returning to the ED for
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.1 P 101 BP 141/54 R 24 O2 sat
96%. Patient underwent a CXR which was essentially unchanged
with possible retrocardiac opacity.  She was given
Vanc/Levofloxacin, Albuterol and Ipratropium for possible PNA.
Cultures/Coags were not sent as she was a difficult stick.  Hct
was notably down from recent baseline and was positive with
brown stool. Pt denied any BRBPR or hematemesis and was given IV
PPI.  She was cross matched for blood and GI was notified.  Pt
was ultimately admitted to the ICU for tachypnea and O2
requirement.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was tachypneic but completing full
sentences and not appearing to be in any distress.  There were
no events and she was transferred to the floor the next day.  On
the floor, she is resting comfortably on 4L, speaking full
sentences, though becoming SOB with minimal exertion (such as
sitting forward for lung exam) and with occasional cough.  She
denies any dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, or
vomiting.
.
Review of sytems:  She was denying CP, palpitations, PND,
orthopnea, lightheadedness, tingling, numbness, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea or BRBPR.  She has baseline dark stools due
to iron replacement and this remains unchanged.  She denies
fevers, URI or congestion but reports general decline in resp
status over the last 6 wks and feels SOB has gradually worsened
with some increased cough with scant hemoptysis since episode of
epistaxis.

ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45
%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2134-11-19**], the LVEF is slightly lower.
.
CT CHEST:
1)Severe emphysema combined with pulmonary fibrosis is most
likely due to the syndrome of combined pulmonary fibrosis and
emphysema (CPFE)with no acute pathology.
2)Stable enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and severe
cardiomegaly
