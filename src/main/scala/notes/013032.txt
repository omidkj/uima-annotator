Chief Complaint:
fever, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
86yo woman with recent ICU admission/hospital stay for sepsis
thought secondary to c. difficile colitis now returns two days
after discharge with fever to 102, worsened dyspnea, and
hypoxemia with desaturations to 80's%. Pt has been at
[**Hospital 71048**] rehab since [**10-6**] following L femur ORIF. On [**11-7**] pt
developed fever at rehab and was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ED.
She was started on a 14 day course of levaquin for ? PNA and
returned to rehab. Pt was again taken to NW with fever on [**11-18**].
She was encouraged to continue levaquin, returned to rehab. On
[**11-21**], pt was again taken to NW with fever. Clinical picture c/w
sepsis--febrile, tachycardic with SBPs in 70s. Pt was started on
zosyn and vanc, CVL placed, started on levophed and tx'd to
[**Hospital1 18**] for ICU care. Pt was initially treated with broad spectrum
abx but was transitioned to flagyl with good response. The pt
was discharged on a 14 day course of flagyl on [**11-26**]. Pt was
doing well at rehab. Diarrhea had resolved for approx 1-2 days
and she was afebrile. However, this am was found to have bp
100/52, hr 120s, sats 80s on RA, c/o SOB, was o/w afebrile.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
.
In ED, vitals were: T 102, hr 112, bp 108/58, rr 24, 98% nrb.
She was pan-cultured, and chest film demonstrated bibasilar
infiltrates. CT chest demonstrated small b/l pleural effusions.
She was treated empirically with vancomycin 1g and ceftazidime
2g for ? PNA. CT abd demonstrated pan-colitis. EKG had no
diagnostic ischemic changes, and one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative. Lactate was 1.3. WBC was 29.4 from 12.6 most recently.
BNP 2400. U/A tr leuks/small blood/neg sediment. Transferred to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
On ROS, pt denies dyspnea at present, though + orthopnea for [**3-5**]
years. B/L leg swelling for a few weeks. Denies PND. Denies CP,
HPs. Denies cough. She denies n/v/d/abd pain. + poor appetite
for weeks.

CTPA:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Enlarged main pulmonary artery with right ventriculomegaly
suggestive of elevated right ventricular pressures and pulmonary
hypertension.
3. Interval increase in the small bilateral pleural effusions
and pericardial effusion.
4. Moderate ascites.
5. Stable 4-mm right middle lobe nodule

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Fever: Patient was without evidence of consolidation on CT
and no history of cough. Her U/A was negative. Additionally,
there are no signs/symptoms concerning for osteo at surgery
site. On recent admission was found to be positive for C.
difficile in setting of diarrhea and was started on course of PO
flagyl.  She was nearly halfway through treatment with flagyl
(to which her diarrhea originally responded) when diarrhea
returned associated with fever. Thus, given history of diarrhea,
recently positive C. diff, grossly elevated WBC and pancolitis
on CT, fever seems most likely secondary to C. diff infection.
It is unclear why C. diff responded originally to flagyl and
then clinical picture worsened, but upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
flagyl was stopped and PO vancomycin was initiated.  With PO
vanco her fever resolved, WBC improved and diarrhea resolved.
She will continue on a 2 week course of vanco (10days left at
d/c).  Repeat stool studies were unremarkable.
.
2) Dyspnea: Appeared more consistent with heart failure than
pneumonia given long h/o orthopnea/LE edema, elevated BNP on
admission and, as above, without cough nor clear infiltrates on
imaging.  There was no echo available in our records, but h/o LE
edema/orthopnea dates back 5+ years.  A TTE done here showed
moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade,
hyperdynamic EF.  She may have diastolic dysfunction.  The
pericardial effusion is likely from total body fluid overload.
There was no evidence of ACS.  AFter her ICU stay, she diuresed
on her own without lasix.  Her oxygenation improved and she was
on RA.  She had no SOB.  Her peripheral edema also improved.
She may need lasix in the future to keep her euvolemic but at
this point is diuresing well without it.
.
3) Tachycardia: Patient was admitted with ST in the setting of
fever.  Also, as above, she appeared clinically intravascularly
dry in setting of diarrhea/poor po. Her tachycardia did respond
well to IV hydration (was a total of 6L positive over 1st 24
hours of hospitalization including ED course)and heart rate
improved from 120s on admission to 90s. Given that her EF was
not known on admission, following the IV hydration throughout
the 1st 24 hours of admission, additional maintenance IV fluids
were held while PO fluids were encouraged.  Her heart rate was
well controlled henceforth.
.
4) Hyponatremia:  Sodium was found to be 136 on admission to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and following NS resuscitation decreased to 132.  IVFs were
held and sodium was trended.  It improved as the pt diuresed
into the low normal range.
.
5) Anemia:  Her baseline is unclear, but hematocrit in our
system has long been low.  Hct did drop mildly on admission
following IVFs, but this is in the setting of nearly 6L positive
so is most likely hemodilutional.  Hematocrit was followed and
stool guaiac was evaluated.  Her hct was stable and iron studies
showed iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease so she was
started on iron.
.
6)  Neuropathy: She was continued on her home dose neurontin
with adequate control of her neuropathic pain.
.
7) S/P Left ORIF: She was continued on her outpatient pain
control regimen with methadone and prn vicodin.  Her home
celebrex was stopped in setting of heart failure.
.
8) Hypothyroid:  She was continued on her home dose of
synthroid.  Her TSH was elevated at 11 but free t4 was wnl so
she likely had sick euthyroid.  Thyroid function tests can be
rechecked in [**1-4**] weeks.
