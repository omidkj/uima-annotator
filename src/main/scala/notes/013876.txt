History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year old man with history of metastatic
prostate cancer, parkinson's, hepatitis C, admitted witha chief
complaint of hematemesis. The pt was at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3504**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] NH today
when, per NH report the pt vomited small amount of frank blood
mixed with food. The pt denied pain, dizzyness or
lightheadedness at that time. He also denied chest pain and
shortness of breath.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old man with Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer
and history of GI bleeding, presenting with new episode of
hematemesis.
.
# GI bleed/hematemesis: Patient had an initial upper endoscopy
and was found to have actively bleeding at a GE
(gastro-esophageal) junction ulcer with superimposed clot. This
was the same site as had previously bled, initiating concern for
underlying metastatic or primary malignancy.  This site was
injected with epinephrine, and given his Jehovah's witness
beliefs (no transfusion of blood products), he was initially
admitted to the ICU for close monitoring.  He was treated with
[**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole and sucralfate, and with these measures, his
hematocrit initially dropped from baseline of low 30's to the
mid 20's and stabilized there, without further evidence of
bleeding. A repeat endoscopy after 48hrs showed the known
ulceration but no further active bleeding, as well as an
esophageal nodule, again concerning for malignancy.
He was followed by the GI and surgical services throughout his
hospitalization.
He was discharged on pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] and sucralfate with plans
to follow up with GI in [**3-11**] weeks time for repeat EGD.
.
# Enterococcus urinary tract infection:  Patient was noted to
have a low grade fever during his hospital course and work up
yeilded a positive urine culture for enterococcus.  He was
treated with a 7 day course of ampicillin, to be completed on
discharge.
.
# Neck pain:  Patient was complaining of neck pain upon arrival
to the floor.  Given his history of metastatic prostate cancer,
an MRI C spine was obtained that demonstrated multilevel
cervical spine degenerative changes with spinal canal narrowing.
 There was much motion artifact given his parkinson's tremor,
and because of this they could not rule out cord compression.
However, clinically the patient did not have cord compression as
his strength and sensation remained intact.  The MRI also
demonstrated non specific enhancement at C4-5 vertebrae, and in
the dura by C2/3, likely consistent with degenerative changes.
Patient was otherwise provided a soft neck collar for support
given his spondylosis.
His neurological exam should be monitered for any signs of
weakness/numbness in which case further evaluation should be
done.
.
# Parkinsons Disease: Given the patient's GI bleed, he was made
NPO for several days, thus missing his antiparkinson's
medications. Prior to transfer out of ICU, he developed rigidity
and worsening of his tremor, thought to be a flair of his
parkisons. Neurology was curbsided and agreed with this
diagnosis as opposed to dystonic reaction. He was given a dose
of cogentin with mild improvement but was believed to be
improving spontaneously.
Throughout the remainder of his hospitalization, he continued to
be quite rigid, which was impacting his mobility.  Because of
this, neurology was consulted and recommended increased dose of
his sinemet and of his entacapone with some improvement.
At time of discharge, his rigidity was stable, and he was
maintained on above medications.
.
# Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia: Likely myelosuppression
secondary to metastatic prostate cancer versus Hepatitis C
cirrhosis. All counts remained at patient's baseline throughout
his hospitalization.
.
# Hypertension: Patient's home regimen of toprol XL and
lisinopril were intially held in setting of bleeding. They were
reintroduced upon stabilization of above.
.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: This was not an active issue and
is being managed as an outpatient.
.
# Depression: He was continued on home celexa and trazodone.
.
# Hepatitis C: No active inp
