none


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 82 yo f with COPD (on 2L home O2) s/p admission [**10-14**]
requiring intubation with end of prednisone taper [**10-31**], h/o
CHF, DM, h/o DVT/PE, who presented from rehab with 2 days of
SOB, lethargy, and reports of increased LE edema. Pt reportedly
had been less participatory at PT per rehab team along with her
2 days of SOB. A CXR done yesterday at rehab reportedly showed
bilateral infiltrates, so she was given a dose levofloxacin. Pt
also had hx of FS of 546 at rehab, was given 6 U reg insulin,
and FS improved to 200's.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt had fever to 101.1 (rectal) and was tachypnic to
40's. She was given Lasix 40mg IV, combivent nebs x 3, Meropenem
1g IV, Levofloxacin 500mg IV, tylenol, ASA 325mg PO, solumedrol
125mg IV x 1, and was placed on a nitro gtt. Her breathing
improved after Lasix, nebs, and nitro. She then had SBP in
80's-90's, which improved to 90's to 100's after NS 250cc x 3.
CXR showed new RLL PNA. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
monitoring of resp status and BP.
.
Pt currently denies CP/SOB, F/C, N/V, diarrhea, headache, back
pain, hematochezia, or hematemesis.

.
CXR: Heart normal size with hyperinflated lungs, peripheral
vascular attenuation, and relatively large central pulmonary
vessels. There is a consolidation in the right lower thorax
probably in the lower lobe. Patchy increased markings
bilaterally. Since last exam [**2135-10-25**] the right lower lobe
process has developed and the right IJ line has been removed. A
new right PIC line has its tip in the mid SVC. IMPRESSION:
Severe emphysema and cor pulmonale. New right lower lobe
pneumonia.
.
CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
EKG: NSR @90, RBBB, LAD, peaked T's in V3-V5, <1mm STE V3-V4 (no
sig change from prior tracings)
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are patchy
opacities in both lower lobes, right worse than left. There are
small bilateral pleural effusions. There is a hiatal hernia.
There are multiple calcified gallstones in a nondistended
gallbladder. The liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands are
unremarkable. There are several calcified splenic granulomas.
There are several possible tiny nonobstructing stones at the
lower pole of the left kidney. There is atherosclerotic disease
of the aorta. Stomach, small bowel, and large bowel are grossly
unremarkable. There is no intra-abdominal free air. No
pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
nodes.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Note is again made of
small pelvic free fluid. The previously demonstrated right
adnexal mass is not well appreciated on this study, which is
limited due to lack of IV contrast. The bladder, rectum, and
sigmoid colon are unremarkable.
Bone windows demonstrate apparent anterior and lateral
displacement of what appeared to be fragments of a lower lumbar
vertebral body that appear new compared to the previous exam.
Scout images are limited due to underpenetration. These findings
are suggestive of a possible lower lumbar compression fracture
without retropulsion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe patchy opacities may represent pneumonia
or aspiration.
2. Free fluid in the pelvis again demonstrated. The previously
described right adnexal mass is difficult to discern on this
exam that is limited by the lack of IV contrast.
3. Possible lower lumbar compression fracture.
4. Cholelithiasis.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no significant
interval change in the appearance of the vertebral body and
intervertebral disc changes at the L4-5 level with postcontrast
enhancement consistent with osteomyelitis and discitis, as well
as interval fibrotic reaction. There is no evidence of a
compression fracture. Endplate destructive changes are stable in
appearance. There is no epidural abscess or paraspinal
collection.
Nerve root diverticula seen at nearly all levels from T11-12
through S1-S2 are again identified.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of known osteomyelitis/discitis at
L4-5 level with no evidence of compression fracture, new
paraspinal or abnormal epidural fluid collection.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Bacterial pneumonia:
Patient admitted with new right lower lobe pneumonia.  She is on
2 L NC at baseline but was requiring 4 liters supplemental O2 on
admission.  She was started on vancomycin and cefepime given
history of MRSA and was quickly able to be weaned to her
baseline 2 L NC with medical management.  In addition to IV
antibiotics, she received IV solumedrol for resultant COPD
flare.  She was initially diuresed but no evidence of CHF on CXR
and blood pressure did not tolerate this well so this was not
continued.  Patient has remained stable on vanc/cefepime and is
now down to 1 L supplemental O2.  She has been converted to
advair/spiriva and is receiving albuterol nebs prn.  Her
steroids have been weaned, she is currently taking 50 mg po qd
but will be weaned to 40 mg po qd starting tomorrow.  She is s/p
pneumovax in '[**34**] but received the influenza vaccine prior to
discharge.  PICC placed [**2135-10-26**] for completion of IV antibiotic
course.  Urine legionella antigen is negative and speech and
swallow evaluation in [**10-14**] showed no
