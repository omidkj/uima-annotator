History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo man from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with h/o CAD, hypothyroidism, with
multiple recent hospitalizations including [**Date range (1) 24547**] at [**Hospital1 18**]
for L5 compression fracture c/b cauda equina and s/p
vertebroplasty and decompression/fusion, [**Date range (1) 24548**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for
polymicrobial hardware related vertebral osteomyelitis, and
[**Date range (1) 24549**] at [**Hospital1 882**] for pneumonia, who presents with increased
dyspnea. At that admission he was noted to have a left pleural
effusion that was not drained as he oxgenated well on minimal
O2. He was discharged on [**5-29**] on 2L O2 requirement and 10-day
course of vancomycin and meropenem, which he completed [**7-4**]. He
was switched to suppressive therapy with cefpodoxime and
augmentin on [**7-5**].
.
According to pt's son, pt began to have increased difficulty
breathing and nonproductive cough 3 days ago but most noticeably
yesterday. He was able to participate in his usual PT but did
have transient desaturation to upper 80s. He was reportedly
for persistent dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. An EKG was done
(not sent) which was notable for T wave inversions in V3, and pt
received NTG en route to [**Hospital1 882**] ED.
.
At [**Hospital1 882**] ED, VS were: T 99.1, HR 92, BP 117/66, RR 20, O2at
100% 4LNC. Pt noted to be audibly wheezing on exam. WBC 20 with
76% neutrophils and 2% bands. Cardiac enzymes negative. EKG with
old RBBB but no TWI. He received duoneb with subjective
improvement and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] as he receives most of
his care here.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: T 97.9, HR 94 114/62 26 100 on
mask. Pt somnolent but responding to questions appropriately.
Still with audible wheezing. He was given nebs without
difference. Labs notable for WBC 30 (81 L, no bands), trop 0.16
with CK 40. EKG with RBBB and IVCD; unchanged from baseline. CXR
noted to have slight interval increase in size of left pleural
effusion from [**2112-5-26**] with mild bibasilar atelectasis and no
radiographic evidence of CHF. CTA chest on prelim read with
increased moderate-sized pleural effusion with simple fluid
attenuation and associated compressive atelectasis. Also with
mild ground-glass opacity in the bilateral upper apices and
right middle lobe. No evidence of PE. Patient was given Zosyn
and levoquine 750mg. BP stayed in 90s but dropped to 60-80s for
unclear reasons although mentating ok per report. Improved to
130s after 500cc bolus IV fluid. On transfer, VS T 98.7, HR 102,
BP 133/64, RR 16, O2 sat 94-95% on 4L NC.
.
On the floor, pt somnolent and not responding to questioning.
Per son, at baseline he is conversant and interactive, able to
stand with assistance. He had been afebrile with no symptoms
other than SOB or cough. He has a G-tube in place for nutrition
but able to take po without e/o aspiration. He reportedly had
some chest wall pain from coughing but denied chest pain. No h/o
malignancy.
.
ROS (per son): As above. Soft stools at baseline but no change
in bowel habits. Edema worsened today. Pt has had fluctuating
leg edema since back surgery for which he receives lasix prn at
Rehab.
