Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
83 yo female with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, diastolic
CHF, ESRD on HD, h/o CVA, and Alzheimers dementia presents from
dialysis with a wide complex tachycardia.  Patient denies any
chest pain, shortness of breath, or other complaints.  On the
day of admission, she presented for her routine dialysis
appointment. During the visit she was noted to look unwell and
not herself.  On arrival of EMS, BP 77/50, HR 121, RR 16, O2
95%.  Patient was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for eval.
.
On arrival, HR 135, BP 90/60, RR 16 O2 90%.  On exam, irregular
rhythym, no JVD, guaiac negative.  ECG revealed a wide complex
tachycardia at rate of 140bpm.  Patient was given Amio and
Calcium gluconate.  Then spontaneously converted to NSR at [**Street Address(2) 14412**] elevations inferiorly in II, III, aVF (III > II)
also with reciprocal depression in I, aVL, V6, V5.  Labs with CK
379, MB 43, MBI 11.3, TnT 13.4.  The patient was given Aspirin,
heparin, intergrillin (couldn't swallow plavix) and taken to the
cath lab.
.
Left Heart Cardiac Catheterization demonstrated;
 1.  CTO of RCA
 2.  LMCA: Distal taper with moderate calcification
 3.  LAD: Proximal 50% w/ heavy calcification, D1 80% lesion.
 4.  LCx: Non-dominant w/ distal flow from l-r collaterals
 5.  Unable to cross CTO of RCA though unlikely acute.
.
Patient was then transferred to the CCU for management.
.
On review of symptoms, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA tapered
distally and
was noted to have moderate calcification.  The LAD had a
proximal 50%
stenosis with heavy calcification.  The D1 had an 80% stenosis
at the
origin.  The LCx was a non-dominant vessel without critical
lesions. The
RCA had a total occlusion with distal flow from left-to-right
collaterals.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed moderate-severe systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with an SBP of 172 mmHg.
3.  Supravalvular aortography revealed no evidence of AI and a
normal
ascending aortic diameter.  The aortogram confirmed the total
occlusion
of the RCA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate to severe systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by medical
therapy with
failed PTCA of complete total occlusion of RCA.

Cardiac Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis
(mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Abdominal USD:
IMPRESSION:
1. No gallstones or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation.
2. Focal mild dilation of infrarenal aorta with nonocclusive
mural thrombus, not meeting size criteria for aneurysm.
3. Small kidneys consistent with end-stage renal disease.
4. Possible small cyst at the head of the pancreas; reevaluation
for stability is recommended in one year's time.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:
.
#CAD: Patient was admitted to the CCU post-cath for management.
Was continued on ASA 325mg, Plavix 75mg daily (with anticipated
duration of one month).  Metoprolol was started and titrated to
a dose of 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient was started on captopril at low
dose (to be held pre-dialysis).  Additionally, lipitor 80mg qd
was initiated.  Patient was transfered to the floor post-cath
day 1 without event.  Echo demonstrated LV diastolic dysfunction
with preserved EF, RV dilated with depressed systolic function.
Echo demonstrated mild aortic stenosis.  Recommend outpatient
evaluation.
.
#V.Tach: Patient was monitored on telemetry in the CCU and later
on the floor.  During that time she had no significant runs of
NSVT and no recurrence of her VTach.  It was felt that her
initial presenting VT was likely due to the metabolic
derrangements (hyperkalemia) on presentation and decision was
made not to pursue an EP study at this time.
.
#ESRD: Patient was dialyzed on presentation.  Was mildly
hypotensive post-dialysis and BP meds were held. Patient was
then returned to her usual M/W/F dialysis regimen.  No further
events.
