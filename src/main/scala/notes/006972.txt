Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3021**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Internal Jugular Venous Line Placement.
Right radial arterial line placement.
[**2120-12-3**] Temporary dialysis catheter placement.

History of Present Illness:
A 61-year-old male with a new diagnosis of metastatic renal cell
carcinoma, unknown subtype, with metastatic disease in the right
frontal lobe, pulmonary nodules and marked adenopathy presented
with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia when he did a routine
blood works for debulking nephrectomy.
.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until today
when he underwent a pre-op blood works.  He was found to have
ARF and hyperkalemia.  He stated that in the last week, he had
mild diarrhea that he attributed to stool softeners.  At that
time, he had mild lower abd cramps associated with diarrhea.
After he hold stool softeners, he experienced constipation now.
His last BM was 2-3 days ago.  He also reported that his PO
intake significant decreased due to the lack of appetite.  He
denied weight loss.  He denied lightheadedness, headache,
dizziness, blurry vision, dry mouth, CP, SOB, chest pressure,
N/V, abd pain, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena.  However, over the
past a few weeks, he noticed his urine output had decreased.
.
In our ED, he received Calcium Gluconate and Insulin and
Dextrose.

IMAGING:
[**2120-12-24**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Possible new intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, which could be
better
evaluated by CT if clinically warranted.
2. Increased left lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Unchanged pulmonary metastases.
.
[**2120-12-24**] RENAL U/S: IMPRESSION: Left renal mass compatible with
known renal cell carcinoma, without hydronephrosis in either
kidney.
.
[**2120-12-25**] ECHO: Left atrium moderately dilated. Mild LVH. EF>75%.
Cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Normal PCWP<12mmHg. RV
cavity mildly dilated. Aortic root mildly dilated. Ascending
aorta mildly dilated.
.
[**2120-12-25**] CT C/A/P: IMPRESSION:
1. Slight enlargement of left RCC tumor with stable necrosis and
no evidence to suggest acute infection of the tumor.
2. Progression of mediastinal, hilar, and retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.
3. Enlargement of the known pulmonary metastases with several
new sub-4 mm nodules.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than the
right. Small consolidation in the left base which may represent
atelectasis or possibly early infection.
5. Progression of lytic [**Month/Day/Year 500**] metastases as described above.
.
[**2120-12-26**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is
new. Moderate cardiomegaly is worsened and there is now a new
small pleural effusion. Extensive pulmonary metastasis is only
partially visible. Interval increase in mediastinal caliber is
probably due to venous engorgement, baseline widening due to
extensive fat deposition and some lymph node enlargement. Right
jugular line ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2120-12-27**] ECHO: Left atrium mildly dilated. LVEF >55%. Aortic
root mildly dilated. Ascending aorta mildly dilated.
.
[**2120-12-30**] LE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis.
.
[**2120-12-30**] V/Q SCAN: IMPRESSION: Very low likelihood ratio for
recent pulmonary embolism. Focal left upper lobe
perfusion/ventilation defect corresponds to a known metastatic
nodule in that region.
.
[**2120-12-31**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-27**], the
overall cardiac size is within normal limits and there is no
definite pulmonary vascular congestion. Left pleural effusion
and small right effusion persists. Multiple nodular metastases
are seen as well as extensive prominence of the mediastinum
caliber that could reflect venous engorgement, lymphadenopathy,
or both. Central catheter has been removed.
.
[**2121-1-1**] RENAL U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous and hypervascular left renal mass, without
frank
hydronephrosis. Elevated resistive indices and decreased
diastolic flow, compatible with known partial renal vein
thrombosis.
2. Mildly elevated right renal resistive indices.
.
[**2121-1-7**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: Right frontal lobe lesions again
seen. The surrounding vasogenic edema has decreased in severity.
No post traumatic abnormalities are seen.
.
[**2121-1-7**] CT C-SPINE: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of fracture or malalignment of the cervical
spine.
2. Multiple hypodense thyroid nodules measuring up to 8 mm in
diameter.  Please correlate with any prior history of ultrasound
examinations for thyroid disease.
3. Left pleural effusion.
.
[**2121-1-7**] X-RAY LEFT HUMERUS/SHOULDER: IMPRESSION: Angulated
displaced fracture of the left proximal humerus and humeral
neck. Underlyi
