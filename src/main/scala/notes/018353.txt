Admission Date: [**2131-3-15**]        Discharge Date: [**2131-3-26**]

Date of Birth:  [**2074-6-16**]        Sex:  Male

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
male with high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, and
diabetes mellitus, who underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft on [**2131-3-8**] with LIMA to LAD and SVG to OM.  The RCA
was difficult to mobilize due to pericardial adhesions at
that point, so the patient had stenting of the RCA and R-PLV
with Taxus DES.  The patient did well postoperatively and was
discharged on [**2131-3-14**].  One day prior to arrival, the
patient awoke with shortness of breath and orthopnea and
returned to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where the patient was treated
for CHF and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and coronary artery
bypass graft, and stent as noted.

ALLERGIES:  AMOXICILLIN.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
2. Colace.
3. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
4. Plavix 75 mg q.d.
5. Lasix 40 mg q.d.
6. Potassium chloride 200 mg q.d.
7. Insulin 70/30, 25 units b.i.d.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, occasional ethanol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother deceased of an MI at age 46.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival, vital signs were blood
pressure 138/81, heart rate 92, respiratory rate of 16,
oxygen saturation 96 percent on 2 liters.  Physical exam:
Lying flat in bed in no acute distress.  No JVD.  Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm.  Chest:  With median sternotomy,
mild rales bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, no tenderness to
palpation.  Right groin without hematoma, no bruits, 2 plus
lower extremity edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of
[**Street Address(2) 107667**] depressions in I and aVL.  No changes from
[**2131-2-11**].  Labs included CK of 223, troponin of 0.36, MB of
18, sodium 137, potassium 4.2, chloride 101, bicarbonate 27,
BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, glucose 230.  White blood cell count
was 11, hematocrit was 24.9, and platelets were 323,000.  The
coronary catheterization showed severe three-vessel native
coronary artery disease, widely patent SVG to OM and LIMA to
LAD, instant thrombosis of the Taxus stent to the R-PLV,
unsuccessful attempt to reopen, no ventriculography.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 52-year-old male, recent
CABG, presents with an acute in-stent rethrombosis to the RPL,
unable to be opened during catheterization, here for
treatment of CHF and coronary artery, on medical management.
The patient was initially seen by Cardiology who suggested
recatheterizing the patient, which as previously noted was
unsuccessful.  After catheterization, the patient was
transferred to the CCU for further evaluation and monitoring.
At this point, the level of CK increased from 223 to 748, and
his troponin increased from 0.36 to 1.92.  The patient had
two episodes of nausea, which was his anginal equivalent,
which was resolved with Zofran.  Prior to transfer to the
CCU, the patient was on the floor with labile blood pressures
and bradycardia in the 50s.  Multiple times, the patient
appeared to be in Wenckebach; however, the patient's cross-
cover resident noted the patient to be diaphoretic and
nauseous with positive emesis and shortness of breath.  At
that point, the repeat blood pressure was 78/40.  A repeat
chest x-ray was done, which showed a left pleural effusion
with question of left lower lobe infiltrate and mild CHF.
The patient was given Lasix.  Cardiology was [**Name (NI) 653**], and
it was decided that the patient should be started on a
dopamine drip to increase cardiac output and help with the
blood pressure.

After attempting to use the dopamine drip, CT Surgery and
Cardiology were consulted.  It was decided to discontinue the
Integrilin and continue the Plavix.  The patient's hematocrit
also had dropped to lower than optimal levels, and the
patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells.
As the patient's hypertension continued despite the best
efforts of the floor team, it was decided that the patient
should be transferred to the CCU, and the patient was
transferred on [**2131-3-19**].  Upon transfer to the CCU on
[**2131-3-19**], the patient, however, had decreased blood pressure
and the dopamine was weaned off.  A pulmonary artery catheter
was placed revealing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
18, pulmonary artery pressure of 43/24, CVP of 11, cardiac
output of 5.7, and an SVR of 1081.  The patient was started
on Captopril 25 mg t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg q.d., and
amitriptyline 125 mg b.i.d.  The patient currently appears
close to euvolemia and relatively symptom-free.  The patient
was also hemodynamically stable at that time.  During his CCU
stay, the patient was approximately nontender with CTs
negative throughout.  At this point, the patient was returned
to the floor for additional medical management.  No further
intervention was attempted.  No other surgical intervention
was attempted at this point.  Cardiology was consulted and
informed the team that the patient had in their opinion a
scarred anterior and posterior wall with overall severe left
ventricular contractile dysfunction as a result of the RCA
graft occlusion.  They suggested the need for the usual
chronic heart failure regimen, given the degree of left
ventricular function.  Over the next few days, the patient's
condition continued to improve with only occasional bouts of
nausea.  The final days of his stay in the hospital were
spent attempting to diurese the patient as much as possible
while keeping his blood pressure at a desired level.
Ultimately, the patient was discharged with plans for
followup with his cardiologist and primary care physician.
