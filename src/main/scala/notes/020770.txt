Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization [**2136-11-16**]
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting X 5 [**2136-11-20**] (SVG "Y" to DIAG
and LIMA to LAD; SVG to RPL; SVG "Y" to Ramus and SVG to OM)


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 780**] is a 64 year old woman with known coronary artery
disease s/p non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in [**2133**]
(medically managed), and stroke who presented to an outside
hospital two days ago with chest discomfort. Patient was ruled
out for MI there and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization. No plavix was given.

Patient reports some decreased exercise tolerance over the past
3-4 months (used to walk 3 miles and now feels short of breath
walking shorter distances). She was walking up a [**Doctor Last Name **] one day
prior to admission from OSH and reports feeling chest pressure
like "someone sitting on her chest" with pain radiating to her L
arm. Reports some minor L calf pain as well. +SOB. No other
associated symptoms such as
nausea/vomiting/dizziness/diaphoresis/LH/LOC. Different from her
previous anginal symptoms in [**2133**](diaphoresis, SSCP with
radiation to her L arm). Pressure continued for a few hours and
never completely resolved with SL nitro. Previous chest
pain/pressure has resolved with nitro in the past. Patient
walked to a CVS afterwards and took her blood pressure and found
it to be quite hypertensive 190/101. Patient reports not taking
her nifedipine, but is compliant with her other medications.
Patient also had an episode of epistaxis which resolved. She is
not taking any anticoagulation currently. Denies SOB, PND, or
orthopnea, or lower extremity edema. No history of DVT or PE.
.
Patient was admitted to OSH and ruled out for an MI. EKG was
without acute ischemic changes. She was noted on Chest CT to
have no PE but with CHF and cardiomegaly. She was given 60 mg IV
Lasix and continued on 20 PO Lasix. Started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]. She was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization. Found to
have 3VD including critical left main disease (60%), LCV 80%
ostial, RCA with 60%, ramus 80% ostial. CT surgery was consulted
and have recommended CABG. Patient was transferred to the floor
s/p catherization: she denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath, or pain at her catherization site. She has not received
any plavix.

use (patient is a former smoker with a > 60 ppy history). There
is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is a family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death (father had 3 [**Name2 (NI) **], first at 63, sister with
rheumatic fever and MI at 30, sister with leukemia.)

Neck: Supple with JVP of 3 cm at 60' angle.
CV: PMI at 5/6 IC space. RRR, S1/S2 heard. soft [**2-1**] SM murmur

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
2D, color Doppler or agitated saline contrast with valsalva
release maneuver.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal within
transient mild apical hypokinesis (LVEF 50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being A paced.
1. Biventricular function is preserved
2. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
3. Other findings are unchanged
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
