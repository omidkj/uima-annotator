CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-12-2**] 11:21 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o free air

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 yo F GERD p/w epigastric pain, +BRB rectal and NGL, belly
diffusely tender
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o free air
STUDY: Portable AP view of the chest.

INDICATION: 50-year-old female with epigastric pain. Assess for
free air.

COMPARISONS: None.

FINDINGS: There is no subdiaphragmatic free air. The heart and
mediastinum are unremarkable in appearance. The lungs are clear.
There is no pleural effusion. A nasogastric tube is identified
with side port well below the gastroesophageal junction. The
aorta is mildly ectatic.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. No
subdiaphragmatic free air.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo F w pmh of psychosis, anxiety, htn presents w/ abd pain,
N/V. +NG lavage and small amount of BRBPR on rectal exam. BP
stable, tachycardia responsive to IVF. N/V resolved. Per GI- not
actively bleeding remaining hemodynamically stable overnight,
not requiring any blood transfusions.
.
#UGI: pt. presents w/ UGI of unclear origin. +NG lavage and
BRBPR. tachycardia responsive to fluids. Seen by GI in the ED
who felt that pt. was not actively bleeding. NGT removed for
discomfort. No more vomiting since presentation. Diff. includes
PUD, varices, gastritis, [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **], malignancy, Dieulafoy's
lesion, AV malformation, hemmorhoids. Pt. has been on recent
steroids which could cause PUD. Given history of red drink prior
to presentation, there is potential for contamination of NG
leavage.  Hematocrit trend overnight was stable on q4 hour
checks.  Patient recieved one dose of IV PPI, then switched to
po PPI daily for 2-4 weeks when tolerating po.  Abdominal exam
remained benign.  GI team cleared patient for outpatient
followup prn and po PPI daily for 2-4 weeks on day of transfer.

# tachycardia: likely [**2-4**] to dehydration, as improved with
fluids, with hct 47.0 suggesting hemoconcentration. Tachycardia
could also be [**2-4**] to anxiety.  patient was monitored on
telemetry with episodes of sinus tachycardia that resolved with
po fluids and resuming po atenolol.

# psychosis: pt. hx. unclear, appears to have had a psychotic
break recently at [**Hospital3 2783**] and was section 12'd to
[**Hospital1 **].  Believed to be related to steriods.  Patient
received last dose of IV steriods in ED on presentation to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Psych meds at home dose were continued: risperdol,
ativan, prozac, klonopin, remeron, thorazine, tigan.  We
obtained psychiatric hx from PCP which includes depression
disoder and anxiety. Psychiatry consulted with section 12 and
recommendation to return patient to [**Hospital1 **] with medical
clearance.  BEST team contact[**Name (NI) **] for transfer clearance.

# seizure hx: Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has no history of seizure
disorder. pt. had a transient episode of eye lid fluttering,
associated with tachycardia, 20 sec of unresponsiveness,
spontaneous resolution with ? period of confusion per nurses
report. When the patient was questioned, she states this is her
usual "seizure pattern". She does not report being medicated for
this condition. Patient was not incontinent of stool or bladder.
Episode is not consistent with seizure activity and likely
related to underlying psychiatric disorders.

# leukocytosis- Afebrile throughout entire stay. Unclear source.
Negative CXR.  Likely [**2-4**] steriod dose.

# Hypertension:  Resumed home atenolol.

# FEN: Resumed regular diet, repleted lytes prn
.
# PPX: po PPI, zofran prn, pneumoboots, SSI.
.
# Code status: presumed full
