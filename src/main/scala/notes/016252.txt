Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4760**]
Chief Complaint:
dark stool

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o woman with a history of diabetes, biventricular
congestive heart failure, right sided more than left, right
sided systolic and left sided diastolic, presumed though not
documented coronary artery disease, atrial fibriallation on
coumadin, and chronic kidney disease is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
with a drop in hematocrit and dark stools.
.
She notes that she has been feeling weak for some time. She in
fact correlates her weakness with a recent increase in her
hydralazine dose from 10mg po TID to 25mg po TID three weeks
ago. She had dark "greenish" stool on monday, and had her
routine labs checked on tuesday which include INR and CBC. Her
INR was noted to be 5 and Hct had droppped form 33 to 24. Her
PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and she was brought to the [**Name (NI) **] by her family.
.
On evaluation in the ED, her BP was 110/60, HR 66, INR 7.7, Hct
19.7. She was given 2 units of FFP, 2 units of PRBCs, 10mg po
vitamin K, and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She had an 18G and 20g PIV
in place. Of note, asymptomatic ST depressions were noted on
precordial leads V2-V4.
.
Further review of systmes is notable for the absence of
abdominal pain, though she does remark on an increase in
bloating and indegestion in recent weeks. She denies diarrhea
but does not constipation. She has never had bleeding before and
reports a normal colonoscopy @ [**Hospital1 2025**] a number of years ago. Of
note, her family took note of a recent increase in her blood
sugars, with values in the last several days consistenyl > 300.
The patient has a history of UTIs and hyperglycemia associated
with this, but denies fevers, dysuria, or polyuria currently.
She denies shortness of breath, no chest pain.

The heart is enlarged. There is linear atelectasis in the right
lower lobe.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
There is no acute pulmonary consolidation.
CONCLUSION:
Overall, findings are suggestive of mild-to-moderate CHF. Please
ensure
followup to clearance.

Brief Hospital Course:
 84 y/o woman with diabetes, atrial fibrialltion on coumadin,
biventricular heart failure, presenting with weakness, a drop in
hemaotcrit and guaiac positive stools.  Hospital course also
complicated by afib with RVR

# Gastrointestinal bleed/Acute blood loss anemia:  Patient was
found to have grossly melanotic stools in the ED and a
hematocrit drop to 20 in the setting of an INR of 7.  She was
given Vitamin K 10mg po and two units of FFP and transfused with
a total of 4 units of blood within the first 18 hours of her
presentation.  The source of her bleeding was unclear but
thought to be upper GI given the rise in her BUN and melena.
However, after discussion with GI, the decision was made to not
pursue endoscopy.  Her hematocrit stabilized as her INR
normalized.  Her antihypertensives and betablockers were held
initially, then restarted. Of note, H Pylori was positive, but
favor not treating as she has no symptoms of gastritis and bleed
was in setting of elevated INR. Hct was stable at 29 at
discharge.
.
# Acute on Chronic biventricular diastolic heart failure:
Torsemide was restarted once patient was stable.  Also restarted
BB,  imdur 20 mg three times daily, hydralazine 25 mg three
times daily once hct stabilized. Pt is not on ACE given h/o RAS.
During her admission on the floor, pt developed afib with RVR
(see below), requiring increased dosing of her lopressor. Her
hydralazine and imdur were held in the setting of uptitrating
her lopressor and SBP only in the 100s-110.  Pts cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**], was consulted while pt was here given her tenuous
volume status at home and the need for many medications changes
(ie increasing her lopressor, holding her imdur/hydralazine),
and noted her weight was up 10 lbs from her dry weight. Her
torsemide was continued at 40 mg three times a day, and she
received metolazone 2.5 mg intermittently. Her hydralazine was
restarted at 10 mg TID, her imdur was re-titrated in at 10 mg
tid, and it was felt by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] that if her BP runs in
90s-100s systolic, this is ok. Given her intake and output were
essentially even on her home diuretic regimen, she was started
on lasix 80 mg IV with metolazone 5 mg prior to each dose. Her
weight dropped from 187 lbs down to 185 lbs prior to discharge.
Her home dose of torsemide 40 mg tid and metolazone 2.5 mg as
needed was restarted at discharge as this seems to keep her just
euvolemic.
.
# Leukocytosis/UTI: Pt had GNR in urine from [**2-11**]. CXR [**2-11**] c/w
CHF, no PNA. Started bactrim on [**2-13**] and urine noted to be
growing pansensitive E Coli and Proteus. She completed a 3 day
course of bactrim. Daughter requested we start prophylactic
antibiotics, however it was felt that bactrim would interfere
with pts coumadin, and macrobid could be neurotoxic in the
setting of chronic kidney failure.
.
# Diabetes: Reports elevated and difficult to control blood
sugars of late. Current UTI als
