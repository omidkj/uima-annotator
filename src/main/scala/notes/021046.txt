Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M with a history of HIV (CD 4 331, VL <50 in [**12-15**]), HCV
(VL 4200 in [**11-15**]), DM II, ESRD on HD, diastolic CHF and anemia
transferred from a nursing home with fevers, hypoxia and
worsened anemia.  HOSP COURSE BY PROBLEM:
.
# Hypoxia.  Thought [**2-9**] overload although PNA also considered
given the ? fever.  He was initially treated with cefepime and
levaquin.  He received HD urgently and had 6kg removed with
significant improvement in symptoms.  He was tranferred out of
the ICU and remained stable on the floor with 2L O2 by nasal
canula.  We recommend:
- adhere to low na diet
- HD as scheduled
- extra HD session tomorrow (Monday) per d/w renal team
- complete 5d course of levaquin for ? pneumonia.  Since he is
on every other day dosing, only needs one more dose on Tuesday
- consider outpatient sleep study.
.
# Anemia: at baseline.  Will need IV iron at HD.
.
# INR supratherapeutic: thus making PE very unlikely.  Held
coumadin and recommend continue holding it especially since he
is on levaquin.  Consider recheck in [**2-10**] days.  If remains >6.0,
consider vitamin K.  There was no evidence of active bleeding.
Can restart coumadin when INR < 3.0.
.
# Altered mental status. Mentating well currently. Continue to
monitor.
.
# Cardiac enzyme elevation. Likely secondary to renal failure.
Not elevated compared to prior measurements. No signs of acute
ischemia based upon history and EKG.
.
# ESRD on HD. Patient reports compliance with HD schedule.
.
# History of graft clots.
- Continue systemic anticoagulation. IVC clot as well.  we held
coumadin as above.
.
# HIV. Stable. Continue antiretroviral regimen.
.
# Hep C. Stable. No current therapy.
.
# DM II. Insuling sliding scale.
.
# Diastolic CHF. Fluid removal at HD. Continue cardiac regimen
of beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker and [**Last Name (un) **].
.
# History of multi-drug resistant organisms including VISA
(Vanc-intermediate sensitivity staph aureus) and MRSA.
- Strict contact precautions.
.
# Hypertension. Continue home antihypertensives
.
# Access: Left femoral HD line.
.
# FEN: Cardiac, diabetic, renal diet.
.
# Prophylaxis. Systemic anticoagulation as at home, bowel
regimen.
.
# Code: Full per referral form.
.
# Dispo: back to NH
