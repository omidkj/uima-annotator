History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 48497**] is a 50 y/o F w/ Crohn's dz, anxiety, hx opiod
abuse, bipolar depression w/ hx ECT and multiple suicide
attempts, fibromyalgia, OSA (nonadherent w/ BiPAP) admitted from
ED w/ PNA. Of note, she was discharged yesterday [**4-14**] after
admission from falling off her bicycle due attributed to
dizziness from recently starting Geodon. She had a CXR on [**4-13**]
which showed mild pulmonary edema but no evidence of PNA. She
reportedly presented to the ED today with back pain and
difficulty breathing after having laid in bed all day. Per ED
note, she had been having shortness of breath x1-2 days, with no
associated chest pain, nausea or vomiting. She was BIBA EMS to
ED w/ SaO2 100% on NRB. When NRB removed, she desaturated to 68%
on RA. NC was attempted and since pt was satting 90% on 6L, NRB
was replaced. In the ED, CXR was concerning for B/L PNA. she was
given Vanco/Levo and Zosyn to cover for hospital acquired PNA,
given recent hospitalization.

In the ED VS: T 99.0 HR 102 BP 107/63 RR 18 SaO2 100% NRB
initially, 77% on 2 L NC, 86% on 4L, 92% on 6L, 100% on NRB.
Just prior to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, pt was intubated for increased work
of breathing/ respiratory fatigue.

IMAGING:

CXR PA & LAT [**4-15**]-
Increased bilateral left mid to lower lung > right mid to lower
lung opacities with suggestion of air bronchograms, particularly
on the left, worrisome for worsened infectious process/bilat
pnas. rec clin [**Last Name (un) **]. superimposed mild edema not excluded

TTE [**2120-4-16**]-
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST [**2120-4-17**]-
Massive respiratory motion artifacts limit the interpretability
of
the study. The main findings are diffuse bilateral confluent
pulmonary
opacities. The opacities show a clear gradient of severity from
the dependent towards the non-dependent lung regions, with
predominant ground-glass and reticular opacities in the
non-dependent and consolidations in the dependent lung regions.
There are mild bilateral pleural effusions with maximum
diameters of 1.3 cm on the left. Minimal paraseptal emphysema at
the apex of the right upper lobe. Moderate mediastinal lymph
node enlargement, the largest lymph node is located in left
paratracheal location and measures 20 mm in diameter. No cardiac
enlargement. No pericardial effusion. Nasogastric tube in situ.
No evidence of abdominal abnormalities. Status post intubation,
right central venous access line and gastric tube are in place.
No evidence of coronary calcifications.
No evidence of destructive bone lesions.

IMPRESSION: The described CT findings are consistent with ARDS.
Small right apical paraseptal emphysema.
Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 48497**] is a 50 year-old female who was admitted for
worsening respiratory distress, consistent with ARDS.

ICU Course: [**2120-4-15**]- [**2120-4-22**]

1. ARDS- Ms. [**Known lastname 48497**] arrived to the ICU from the ED intubated
and sedated for increased work of breathing. She had initially
arrived on NRB, but desatted to 68% on RA. Initially, the
thought was pt had worsening B/L PNA, so she was treated for HAP
in the ED w/ Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levofloxacin. In the ICU, TTE
was done on [**4-16**] to evaluate potential component of heart
failure that could contribute to pulmonary edema- TTE revealed
normal biventricular function. She had CT chest done on [**4-17**]
which was consistent with ARDS. Pt underwent bronchoscopy and
had bronchoalveolar lavage which was unrevealing for any
infectious etiology. The reason for her ARDS remains largely
unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1092**] surgery was consulted in the ICU to evaluate
pt for possible VATS-mediated vs. open lung biopsy to help
determine etiology of her respiratory failure, but at the time
it was thought to be too risky to perform on this intubated pt.
Due to prolonged sedation w/ propofol and concern for elevated
triglycerides, Ms. [**Known lastname 48497**] was transitioned to sedation with
ketamine after extensive discussion with pharmacy, with
midazolam and zyprexa for agitation, which the patient tolerated
well. (She did not tolerate sedation with versed/ fentanyl
likely due to history of opiod abuse and multiple psychiatric
medications).  Ms. [**Known lastname 111476**] respiratory status continued to
improve in the ICU; she was weaned from sedation and ventilator
settings and eventually extubated on [**4-21**] with diuresis with
lasix.  Her BNP on admission was > 3000 and after diuresis was <
200. An 8 day course of Vancomycin/Zosyn and Levofloxacin was
completed on [**4-22**] to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia
although she had negative cultures from her bronchoscopy.  [**Doctor First Name **]
was sent to evaluate for potential autoimmune process to explain
her respiratory compromise and returned positive at 1:160 in
diffuse pattern. Scleroderma antibodies and other autoimmune
labs were pending at time of transfer out of ICU and will need
to be followed. Pt will need outpatient pulmonology follow-up
for further evaluate this once all her labs return.  On the
floor, she was continued on PO lasix (10mg every other day) and
her supplemental O2 was weaned to 2-2.5L.  She was discharged on
home O2.

2. Anxiety/Bipolar d/o - patient's psychiatric medications were
held during ICU course as pt was intubated and unable to take PO
medications. Psychiatry evaluated pt in ICU who thought it was
safe to hold psychiatric medications while intubated.  On
transfer to the floor, she was restarted on her home medications
(pregabalin, duloxetine, and klonipin)

3. CROHN'S DISEASE- Mesalamine was held from [**Date range (1) 62159**] and
restarted on [**4
