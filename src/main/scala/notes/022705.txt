History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19420**] is a 42-yo man with cirrhosis [**1-22**] EtOH + HCV on
transplant list, pulmonary HTN, severe diuretic refractory
ascites, and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, who presented to
OSH after being found unresponsive by his mother. [**Name (NI) **] has been
doing well at home since his last hospitalization (see d/c
summary dated [**2148-3-28**]), until this morning. He has been having
weekly therapeutic paracenteses, and his most recent one was
yesterday under ultrasound guidance. He had 7L of clear yellow
ascites removed, and fluid analysis showed no evidence of SBP.
He did receive 4 bags of albumin. Serum labs yesterday also
showed hyponatremia of 124 and creatinine 1.8, so he was advised
to stop his diuretic Aldactone. Per his mother, he missed his
morning dose of lactulose because of the plan for the
procedures, but did have two bowel movements in the morning. He
received his PRN codeine for hand and feet cramps, so his mother
gave him a double-dose of lactulose in the evening as well,
since she "knows that codeine binds him up". He was still doing
well at 3am when she checked on him overnight, but this morning
he was unresponsive, so EMS was called.

He was given Narcan 1mg IV en route to OSH ED without response.
On arrival VS: Temp 96.5F rectal, BP 90/62, HR 90, R 20, SaO2
98% RA. He received an additional Narcan 2mg IV without effect.
Labs were significant for WBC 5.8 w/ 87% PMNs and 2% bands, Hct
21.6, Plts 68; Na 128, K 5.8, Cr 2.0; TBili 9.6, Alb 3.1, INR
1.8, and Lipase 592. Serum EtOH was negative, and ABG was
7.54/27/484 on 100% FiO2. He also received IVF NS 500cc bolus,
Lactulose 30ml, Kayexelate 30g, and 1unit PRBCs. He is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 year-old male with cirrhosis [**1-22**] EtOH & HCV on transplant
list, pulm HTN, severe diuretic refractory ascites, and
recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, who presented to OSH
unresponsive in the setting of getting codeine and missing one
dose of lactulose, found to have an elevated ammonia and
otherwise negative work-up for altered mental status. He
required a brief stay in the MICU, and was then transferred to
the hepatic service. Hospital course was as follows.

1. Hepatic encephalopathy - In the setting of getting codeine
and missing a dose of lactulose, also suggested by elevated
ammonia at OSH and fact that he had not moved bowels in >24hrs.
Other possibilities include variceal bleeding or SBP or
hypercarbia secondary to known sleep apnea and refusal to wear
CPAP machine. Had a paracentesis day prior to admission with 7L
fluid removed, and fluid analysis showing no evidence of SBP.
Should consider possibilty of transient secondary bacterial
peritonitis [**1-22**] paracetnesis yesterday, but exam and labs on
admission did not suggest infection. Regarding variceal
bleeding, he has known grade II varices and h/o Guaiac-positive
stools, but Hct was stable at OSH and he responded well to
transfusion. The patient was continued on cipro and rifaxmin.
Bedside U/S revealed no safe pocket of ascites and little
overall ascites; he was not tapped. He was given lactulose q2hrs
in the ICU. His mental status improved with with increased BM's.
He was then transfered from the ICU to the Liver/Kidney service.
     On arrival to the liver service, his mental status was at
his baseline. He was changed to lactulose five times daily and
continued to do well. He was provided a CPAP machine but refused
to wear it given discomfort. His rifaximin dosing was increased
from 200mg to 400mg TID. He was started on a veget
