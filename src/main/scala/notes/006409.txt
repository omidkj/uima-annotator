Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 38975**] is a 67 yo male with severe COPD, s/p recent
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and atypical pneumonia in
[**Month (only) 547**], cancer of the layrnx who presents with shortness of
breath and productive cough. The patient finished his prednisone
taper approximately 1 week ago.  His wife reports that his
breathing worsened as the steroids were tapered but that it has
been much worse since the steroids were off 1 week ago.  When
his breathing is at it's best, he is able to do some household
chores and walk across the room.  However, for the past few days
he has not been able to get out of his chair.  He has a chronic
cough with white/[**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum at baseline, but the sputum turned
green approximately 3 days ago.  He was started on azithromycin
and levofloxacin approximately 2 days ago without improvement in
his symtoms.  He denies fevers and rigors, but reports feeling
chilled and sweaty.  He does not feel like he has a cold or flu.
 He reports increased wheezing.  His wife reports poor PO intake
and increased confusion, which is typical of his COPD
exacerbation.  Patient's steroids were increased around [**3-14**] and
then quickly tapered. Of note, pt takes Bactrim for PJP PPX
while on steroids.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.2 HR 95 BP 151/67 RR 28 O2SAT:
90% 4L.  He was tachypneic, wheezy on exam and with poor
airflow.  CXR was negative for infiltrates.  His EKG was
unchanged.  He was hypoxic to 88% on 4L so was placed on
non-invasive ventilation with improvemetn in O2 sats to 94-95%.
Patient was given Ipratropium Bromide & Albuterol Nebs,
MethylPREDNISolone Sodium Succ 125mg IV x1, and Levofloxacin
750mg IV x1.  VS prior to transfer were AF 92 133/53 25 95%
CPAP: FiO2 .35 Peep 8.

In the ICU, patient is no longer on non-invasive ventillation.

Past Medical History:
- COPD, on 4L home O2, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Pt uses CPAP at
night and has done so for a long time possibly for OSA vs night
time ventilatory support for COPD.
- Newly diagnosed T1 larynx cancer
- [**Doctor Last Name **] 8 prostate adenocarcinoma
- Depression
- H/o pyloric stenosis
- Memory loss: no formal diagnosis of dementia

Social History:
Patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] 2 grown children.  Reports 4
pack per day times 35 years.  Quit in [**2112**].  Served in [**Country 3992**];
history of [**Doctor Last Name 360**] [**Location (un) 2452**] exposure.  No current alcohol

ECHO [**4-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. A right-to-left shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen during Valsalva maneuver release
(bubble study). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: right-to-left shunt at atrial level (note that
neither the size, nor the predominant directionality, nor the
anatomic classification of the atrail shunt can be determined on
thre basis of a positive bubble study; however, this most likely
represents either a patent foramen ovale or a small secundum
type atrial septal defect)

CXR [**4-4**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.

CT chest [**4-4**] IMPRESSION:
1. Resolution of left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, consistent
with infectious or inflammatory etiology.
2. New patchy consolidations involving the left upper lobe and
lingula,
consistent with bronchopneumonia.
3. Severe emphysema and diffuse bronchial wall thickening.
4. Right renal cystic structure, incompletely characterized. If
clinically
warranted, ultrasound on a non-emergent basis could be
considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o male with a PMHx significant for severe COPD on 4L of
home oxygen, who presented with worsening shortness of breath
and productive cough.

# Dyspnea: Likely related to COPD exacerbation. He has Gold
stage IV COPD. There was a question of an underlying pneumonia
based on CT findings; however, he was not noted to have fevers
or a leukocytosis. He was placed on BiPAP overnight and
tolerated this well. He was transitioned back to NC on th
emorning following admission. Of note, echo showed evidence of
R-to-L shunt, which could be contributing to hypoxemia. He was
placed on ipratropium and albuterol nevs. His dose of advair was
increased. He was also started on prednisone. Given concern for
possible infection, cefepime was started. He was also continued
on his previously-started 5-day course of azithromycin. he
completed the 5-day course of azithro and cefepime was
discontinued on [**4-6**] as there was low suspicion for infection.

Pulmonary recommended the following:
- Consider switching to BiPap 14/10 QHS.
- Continue high-dose Advair (500/50) on discharge.
- Slow prednisone taper on discharge with prompt outpatient
pulmonary clinic follow-up within 1 month while still on taper.
- Outpatient sleep study as soon as possible following
discharge.
- Follow up in sleep clinic following sleep study to titrate
NIPPV settings.

The patient may benefit from BiPAP.  He will discuss with
primary pulmonologist or at sleep clinic appointment to get
BiPAP approved for home use.  It would be more for ventilatory
failure rather than OSA.  In the meantime, he will continue with
CPAP.

# Hypernatremia: On admission, it was felt that this was
hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of poor PO intake. Given
IVFs overnight and sodium was improved this morning.

# Anemia: Hematocrit noted to drift down during the first day of
admission. Guiaic positive on exam. Fe studies c/w borderline
ACD. Hematocrit was stable.

# Thrombocytopenia: Plt count trended down following admission,
and were also noted to be down from recent baseline.
Thrombocytopenia could possi
