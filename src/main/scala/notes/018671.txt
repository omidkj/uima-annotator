History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] is a very nice 81-year-old gentleman with newly
diagnosed ampullary adenocarcinoma. Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] presented
approximately a year ago with right-sided abdominal pain. He was
referred for endoscopy and found to have adenomatous polyps.
Most of these were resected endoscopically.  On [**2132-3-6**],
he underwent a repeat upper endoscopy.  This demonstrated
recurrent adenomas.  Biopsy this time showed poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma. He continues to have persistent
abdominal pain and anorexia.  He states he has lost 35 pounds
over the last year.  He did have a CT scan done today which
demonstrated large mass lesion in the second portion of the
duodenum. The patient was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in her
[**Hospital 79163**] clinic and after discussion with the patient,
he was scheduled for elective Whipple resection on [**2132-4-2**].

DIAGNOSIS:
Whipple resection, pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy
(A-AC):
1.  Invasive adenocarcinoma of the periampullary duodenum,
poorly differentiated, arising from an adenomatous precursor
lesion with high grade dysplasia, with invasion into subserosal
adipose tissue (pT3); lymphovascular and perineural invasion is
present; see synoptic report.
2.  Seven of thirteen lymph nodes with involvement by
adenocarcinoma ([**8-8**]- pN2).
3.  Extrahepatic bile duct segment and ampulla, within normal
limits.
4.  Pancreatic parenchyma with focal changes of low grade
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIn-1), focal dilation of
pancreatic ducts, and squamatization of duct epithelium.

MACROSCOPIC
Specimen Type:  Duodenum.

Other organs Received:  Head of pancreas, Ampulla, Common bile
duct.

Tumor Site:  Duodenum.

Tumor configuration:  Infiltrative.

Tumor Size: Greatest dimension:  4.2 cm.

MICROSCOPIC

Macroscopic Tumor Perforation:  Not identified.

Histologic Type:  Adenocarcinoma (not otherwise characterized).

Histologic Grade:  G3:  Poorly differentiated.

EXTENT OF INVASION
Primary Tumor (pT):  pT3: Tumor invades through the muscularis
propria into the subserosa or into the nonperitonealized
perimuscular tissue (mesentery or retroperitoneum) with
extension 2 cm or less.

Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):  pN2: Metastasis in 4 or more
regional lymph nodes.

Lymph Nodes
    Number examined:  13.
    Number involved:  7.

Distant metastasis:  pMX:  Cannot be assessed.

MARGINS
Segmental Resection or Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple)
    Proximal Margin:  Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
    Distal Margin:  Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
    Circumferential (Radial) or Mesenteric Margin :  Uninvolved
by invasive carcinoma (tumor present 1 mm from margin; see Slide
N).

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple)
    Bile Duct Margin:  Margin uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
    Pancreatic Margin:  Margin uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.



Lymphovascular Invasion: Present



Perineural Invasion: Present

 Additional Pathologic Findings:
        Adenoma(s).

Comments:  Adenomatous precursor of the duodenum is present in
multiple sections, but is shown best on Slide K. No dysplastic
precursor is found within the ampullary region itself, arguing
against the tumor origin from this site.

Clinical:   Ampullary mass.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with ampullary mass was admitted to the Surgical
Oncology Service on [**2132-4-2**] for elective Whipple procedure. On
[**2132-4-2**] , the patient underwent pylorus-preserving
pancreaticoduodenectomy and placement of gold fiducials for
possible postoperative CyberKnife therapy, which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). Inraoperatively patient was transfused with 2 units of
RBC for low HCT, he was extubated post operatively and
transferred in ICU for observation. The patient was
hemodynamically stable. In ICU patient was hypotensive with low
urine output, which was treated with fluid boluses. On POD # 2,
patient was transferred on the floor in stable condition.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was uneventful and followed the
Whipple Clinical Pathway without deviation.  Post-operative pain
was initially well controlled with epidural catheter and
Dilaudid PCA, which was converted to oral pain medication when
tolerating clear liquids. The NG tube was discontinued on POD#2,
and the foley catheter discontinued at midnight of POD# 3. The
patient subsequently voided without problem. The patient was
started on sips of clears on POD# 3, which was progressively
advanced as tolerated to a regular diet by POD# 5.  JP amylase
was sent in the evening of  POD# 5; the JP was discontinued on
POD#7 as the amylase level were low and output continue to
decrease. Patient was started on home dose of Coumadin on POD #
6, and he was bridged with SC Lovenox prior discharge as his INR
was subtherapeutic. Patient will continue on SC Lovenox and
Coumadin until his INR reach therapeutic level, INR will be
motinored by [**Hospital **] Hospital [**Hospital 197**] Clinic as outpatient.
During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive
spirrometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The
patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were
used during this stay. The patient's blood sugar was monitored
regularly throughout the stay; sliding scale  insulin was
administered when indicated.
At the time of discharge on [**2132-4-9**], the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a
regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain
was well controlled. The patient was discharged home without
services. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up
in
