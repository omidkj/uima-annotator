Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: 3.7 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: *4.1 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 64 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - Mean Gradient: 40 mm Hg
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.1 m/sec
Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.2 m/sec
Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 0.92
Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 270 msec
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is very difficult to assess but it may be
normal (LVEF>55%).
2. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2167-12-7**], LV
function may have improved.

COLONOSCOPY:
(Rectal polyp, polypectomy):
Distorted fragment of benign colonic mucosa with melanosis coli;
no
adenomatous change seen (multiple levels examined).


Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo Russian speaking female with extensive PMH presents with
weight gain and increased fatigue over the past 3-4 weeks.
1)Anemia: Pt was recently admitted in [**2170-5-31**] for anemia
work-up and found to have a bleeding gastric ectasia on EGD
which was removed.  Colonoscopy at that time revealed a benign
polyp.  Pt was found to have Hct of 18 on this admission.  Pt
was transferred to the CCU for monitoring and received 8 units
of PRBC with appropriate increase from 18 to 33.  The anemia was
thought to be subacute since she was never hemodynamically
unstable. GI was consulted.  Coumadin was held for suspected GI
bleed.  Colonoscopy was scheduled but held for persistent high
INR which was reversed with vitamin K.  Pt was a difficult prep
and required almost 4-5 days of prepping with Golytely and other
laxative.  Pt finally underwent colonoscopy which revealed no
source of bleed.  Since pt's Hct was stable 25 34-35, no further
diagnostic procedure was done.  If pt were to develop another
acute/subacute anemia, capsule study was recommended.

2) CHF: Pt has a long hx of CHF per old records. Last echo
before admission was from [**2168**] which showed EF of 35-40%.  She
got an echo on [**9-20**] which showed EF>55%.  Pt was initially
started on niseritide and lasix for diuresis for suspected CHF
exacerbation before her initial Hct of 18 came back.  Pt
received lasix between transfusions.  Lisinopril was held for
increased creatinine.  Pt's wt was stable and CHF status was
stable initially.  However, after 5 days of prep for the
colonoscopy, pt started to gain weight everyday and was net
positive daily.  Pt was refractory to standing IV Lasix and
Diuril.  She got PICC line placed under IR and Natrecor gtt was
started with still net positive daily.  Lasix gtt was added and
was titrated up to 10-15mg/hr which gave some reponse initially
but again became refractory to it.  Dopamine gtt was tried but
showed no improvement in UOP.  Pt lost PICC access.  However one
day, she started to respond extremely well with lasix gtt at
10mg/hr and IV Diuril 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] only (without Natrecor).  Pt's
admission weight was 130 kg (128 kg in a clinic note) and has
gotten up as high as 139 kg.  However, she was able to diuresis
1-2L/day and her weight came down to 130kg which is her
baseline.  The diuretics were changed to po form (Lasix po 120
mg [**Hospital1 **] and Diuril po 125 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and pt continued to diuresis
with net negative daily.  Pt's CHF was thought to be possibly
from AS.  If that is the case, valve replacement could improve
her symtoms. Review of the aortic valve orifice and
consideration of valve replacement should be discussed as
outpatient.  Pt needs to follow up with a [**Hospital 1902**] clinic within 1
week.

3) Afib: Pt with hx of atrial fibrillation but now in sinus
rhythm. Rate is bradycardic. Pt noted to have pauses on tele up
to 2 seconds. Pt was continued on amiodarone 200 mg po qd.
Coumadin was held in a setting of GI bleed and also for high INR
prior to colonoscopy.  Coumadin was restarted with goal INR of
[**1-2**].  Pt needs to be seen by her PCP to check her INR level.

4) COPD/restrictive lung dz: Pt was continued on 2 L of oxygen
which is her baseline.  Pt was getting nebulizer prn for
wheezing and SOB.  Pt is on home O2.

5) DM: Pt was initially continued on home meds of avandia and
glyburide and was cover with RISS.  However, avandia was held
while she was NPO.  She will be discharged with her home
regimen.

9) CODE: DNR/ DNI- this was re-discussed with patient and
husband to determine if pt still wants to be DNI/DNR as she has
been DNR/DNI on prior admissions.
