Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for presumed urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic and Therapuetic Paracenteses


History of Present Illness:
51 yo M with decompensated ETOH cirrhosis (diuretic refractory
ascites dependent on [**Doctor First Name 4397**] q2weeks, esophageal variceal
bleeding) on liver transplant list with usual MELD in 20 who was
admitted to a hospital in RI with acute kidney injury and
hypotension attributed to urosepsis. He was hyperkalemic
requiring 1 HD session. On pressors for a brief period of time,
not intubated. Encephalopathic with ascites (ruled out for SBP
with diagnostic para). Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] SICU with labs:
Tbili 1.4, INR 1.5, Creat 4 -> MELD 26.
.
Per d/c summary, Pt presented there on [**10-26**] with abdominal pain
and altered mental status (was described as lethargic at the
time of presentation). Found to have systolic BP in 70's, HR 70,
with distended, mildly tender abdomen. Labs (though these are
not the admission labs - we do not have records of those)
revealed wbcs 6.5 (87 N, 3 B), plts 93, inr 1.7, Una <10, creat
2 and potassium 8. D/C summary notes Na 117. Also must have had
an abnormal UA because admitted to ICU with presumed dx of
urosepsis and started on pressors, vanc, CTX. Hyperkalemia did
not respond to fluids, kayexelate, insulin and bicarb so
eventually dialyzed. Review of OSH records does not show any
ascities fluid studies, but does show a cx with no growth. Also
revlealed a urine cx growing >[**Numeric Identifier 4856**] yeast. He was thought to
have PSE and was treated with lactulose.
.
Of note, pt was recently discharged on [**10-15**] after admission for
hyponatremia and [**Last Name (un) **] thought to be due to overdiuresis in
setting of admission to OSH earlier in the month for pna/sepsis.
He was noted to have baseline systolic BPs in the 70's-90's and
for this reason his nadolol was held upon discharge. Also found
to have yeast in urine on [**2196-10-11**], and it does not appear as
though this was treated.
.
Pt himself is not cooperative w history - he corroborates most
of what I tell him was in the d/c sum but can't recall specific
details himself.
.
In the SICU he was alert and oriented. He complained of RLQ
tenderness at LV paracentesis site from [**10-29**]. He denies
symptoms of polyuria, dysuria, or suprapubic discomfort prior to
admission. PICC placed. Triple lumen in R-IJ. Stooling well.
Started on midodrine, octreotide, nadolol and albumin therapy
for HRS.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI

gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

Pertinent Results:
[**2196-10-31**] CXR: Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular
crowding. The patient is rotated to the right. A right
subclavian PICC line and right internal jugular catheter both
terminate in the region of the superior atriocaval junction. An
enteric tube ends in the region of the pylorus or beyond. Right
middle and lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. A possible small
right pleural effusion versus pleural thickening is stable since
[**2196-8-23**]. No new consolidation is seen. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are stable, allowing for low lung
volumes and patient position. There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
[**2196-10-31**] Liver U/S: The liver is nodular and shrunken consistent
with known cirrhosis. There is a large amount of ascites. The
gallbladder is edematous and filled with stones and sludge.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. No
focal concerning lesions are seen. There is again splenomegaly
measuring 16.9 cm. Color and pulse wave Doppler evaluation of
the liver was performed. The main, anterior right, posterior
right, and left portal veins are patent with antegrade flow. The
hepatic veins are patent. There are normal waveforms within the
hepatic arteries. The IVC is patent and there is a recanalized
paraumbilical vein. The splenic vein and SMV could not be
visualized due to bowel gas in the midline.
IMPRESSION: 1. Normal Doppler evaluation of the liver. 2.
Cirrhosis and portal hypertension including a large amount of
ascites, splenomegaly, and recanalized periumbilical vein. 3.
Cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo M with decompensated ETOH cirrhosis (diuretic refractory
ascites dependent on paracenteses q 2 weeks, esophageal variceal
bleeding s/p banding) currently on transplant list, transferred
here from OSH for continued management of ascites,
encephalopathy, hypotension from presumed urosepsis, and acute
kidney injury possibly secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient has ? HRS and was started on albumin, midodrine,
and octreotide upon admission. His creatinine slowly trended
down towards a recent baseline of about 1.5, until he began to
experience profuse diarrhea (addressed below), when it bumped in
reflection of likely hypovolemia. His creatinine improved by
stopping the diarrhea and giving albumin. His creatinine at
discharge was 1.6.
