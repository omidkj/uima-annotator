Carotid Bruit        Right:-    Left:-

Pertinent Results:
[**2200-12-5**] Cath: Severe 90% LMCA stenosis, 70% RCA stenosis.

[**2200-12-8**] Carotid U/S: 1. 40-59% stenosis of the right internal
carotid artery. 2. Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal
carotid artery.

[**2200-12-10**] Echo: Pre bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is borderline moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.3-cm2 on average, range 0.9- 1.6 cm2,
varies with atrial fibrillation, severe cad precludes dobutamine
stress echo) with poor mobility of left and non coronary cusps.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: Bioprosthetic Aortic valve in place peak gradient
5, mean 2 mm Hg. No perivalvular leaks. Preserved EF- 55%. MR
now trace to mild. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of
the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-12-4**] for further
management of her myocardial infarction and known aortic
stenosis. She underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed
severe left main and right coronary artery disease. An echo
demonstrated severe aortic valve stenosis. Given the severity of
her disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for
surgical management. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner including a carotid ultrasound which showed 40-59%
stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and less than 40%
stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Plavix was stopped
in anticipation of surgery. Dental clearance was obtained.
Heparin was continued given her chronic atrial fibrillation. On
[**2200-12-10**], Ms. [**Known lastname 89480**] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels and
an aortic valve replacement(Left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery and saphenous vein grafts to obtuse
marginal and posterior descending arteries/ Aortic valve
replacement with size 21 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue valve/Aortic
endarterectomy). Please see operative note for
details.Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=120 minutes. Cross Clamp
time= 103 minutes.  On postoperative day one, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty. Beta
blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed. All lines and
drains were discontinued in a timely fashion. She continued to
progress and on postoperative day two, she was transferred to
the step down unit for further recovery. Physical therapy
service was consulted for evaluation of her  strength and
mobility. She was gently diuresed towards her preoperative
weight. Coumadin was resumed for atrial fibrillation. She will
resume outpatient coumadin management as per preoperatively with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**]. She continued to make steady progress and was
discharged to home with VNA on postoperative day 7. All follow
up appointments were advised.
