Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Valium

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with bipolar disorder, COPD,
morbid obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes,
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for therapeutic catheterization for
possible STEMI. She was en-route from [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for psych
evaluation for agitation to [**Doctor First Name **] group home when she became
lethargic and SBP in 90s in the ambulance.  She was diverted to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ER where she was worked up for MI. She noted right
arm pain, back pain, and mild chest pain.  EKG demonstrated
ST-segment elevations on arrival. First set of cardiac enzymes
at [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 **] were within normal limits. Patient has had recent
episodes of chest pain with r/o for MI. Most recent
hospitalization in [**2156-8-17**] for chest/R arm pain following
Dobutamine stress echo was thought to be related to pneumonia
and/or neuropathy. She was noted to be a poor historian on exam
at [**Location (un) 620**].

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**], she was catheterized, which
demonstrated clear coronaries.  During the procedure, the
patient experienced low blood pressures with the BP cuff in the
SBP 60s. When measured with the catheter, they were
approximately 10mmHg higher.

According to her cousin, [**Name (NI) **] is definitely different from her
baseline friendly personality, more combative and agitated.
Cousin stated concern that her behavior over last few weeks
could be related to med changes.  Typically, at baseline, she is
a very reliable historian with facts and usually makes her own
healthcare decisions. Her HCP is her niece [**Name (NI) 11923**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80747**]
who was unable to be reached by the cousin (they are estranged).

Per patient, this chest pain is the same as the chest pain she
has always had. It is reproducible with deep breathing, mostly
on her right side.

ROS was limited by the patient's agitation and limited ability
to focus at time of exam.  She does not appear to have bowel or
bladder complaints. No recent change in appetite, weight loss or
gain.  Per other notes, no cough, fever, or night sweats. She
does have occasional arthralgias, but no myalgias on Zocor. She
denies any headache or rash.


Past Medical History:
Significant for bipolar disorder, hypertension, COPD, sleep
apnea, ulcerative colitis, facial palsy, peripheral vascular
disease, diabetes, triglyceridemia, peripheral neuropathy,
hypertension, CHF, anxiety, and depression.


Social History:
The patient lives at [**Location 1036**] group home. She used to smoke
[**1-17**] pack for 34 years, quit [**2153**]. No alcohol. The patient did do
most ADLs.


Family History:
Notable for CAD, diabetes in father and grandfather.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2156-9-24**]):

Studies:
[**2156-9-22**] EKG - Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Intraventricular
conduction delay. Delayed precordial R wave transition. Peaked T
waves. No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2156-9-22**] AP CXR - FINDINGS: Right costophrenic angle excluded from
view. Mild prominence of pulmonary vasculature consistent with
mild interstitial edema. Faint right upper lobe opacification
may represent asymmetric edema versus pneumonia.  Enlarged
mediastinal silhouette corresponding with fat-enveloped
mediastinum on c
