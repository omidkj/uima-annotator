Studies:
EGD [**2136-8-17**]: 4 cords of grade III large esophageal varices were
seen starting at 20 cm from the incisors in the upper third of
the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. The junctional
varix had red whale signs. The varices were not bleeding.
Severe portal hypertensive gastropathy seen throughout the
stomach with cherry red spots without signs of active bleeding
or oozing. retroflexed revealed small hiatal hernia with small
gastric varices on lesser curvature left undisturbed. Normal
duodenal bulb and second portion
.
Colonoscopy [**2136-8-17**]: Moderate left sided diverticulosis without
signs of active bleeding, otherwise normal colonoscopy to the
cecum. Retroflexion in the rectum revealed hyertrophy of anal
papila and one cord of rectal varices without signs of active or
recent bleed, moderate internal hemorrhoids left undisturbed.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 y.o female with pmhx of  HCV/ETOH cirrhosis decompensated in
the past with grade 1 varices in [**2129**], small amount of ascites,
and encephalopathy with recent diagnosis of metastatic
adenocarcinoma ( thought to be a pancreaticobilliary source) who
received a [**8-2**] EUS with FNA and who presented with
hematochezia and altered mental status.
.
Active Issues
#Hematochezia- Rectum revealed maroon stools. Patient placed on
Octreotide, Pantoprazole drips and started on Ceftriaxone ppx.
Differential included variceal bleed, diverticulosis. Hct
dropped from 35 to 28. Intubated without complication and
underwent EGD which revealed severe esophageal and gastric
varices with diverticulosis on colonoscopy. No role in TIPS per
hepatology given underlying malignancy. CT torso also carried
out which verified malignancy metastases, with enlarged nodes by
liver and pancreas unknown primary. Pt was transferred to the
floor, where her symptoms were controlled with oral morphine for
pain and SL zydas for agitation. There was no blood noted
.
Pain: See above. After being transferred to the floor, patient
was controlled on IV and PO morphine. Eventually switched to all
PO meds. Standing morphine has had to be uptitrated, and at
discharge she was receiving 7.5mg of concentrated SL MS q2h,
with an additional [**5-17**] q1h:breakthrough pain. It is difficult
to assess patient as she is usually sedated, however, she can
become anxious/agitated in the morning and when prompted, will
occasionally report that she has abdominal pain.
.
#Confusion-thought to be multifactorial including hepatic
encephalopathy and delirium post sedation. Was extubated on [**8-17**]
and patient remained agitated and delirious pulling out her
central line placement. A family meeting took place with the
patient's sister and husband who were health care proxies. Poor
prognosis due to underlying malignancy and cirrhosis were
explained to them. Reported that she has weeks to months to
live. Systemic chemo was offered but cons outweighed pros given
that the main concern for the health care proxies were the
comfort of the patient. Therefore, on [**8-18**] she was placed as
comfort care only and lactul
