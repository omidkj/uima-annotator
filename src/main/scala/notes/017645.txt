Surgeon:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 3795**]

HISTORY  OF  THE  PRESENT  ILLNESS:    This  is a 54-year-old
gentleman,  who  was  recently  discharged  on  the  13th  of
[**Month (only) **]  to  rehabilitation  with multiple medical problems,
including  coronary  artery disease, status post [**Female First Name (un) 899**] in [**2115**],
congestive  heart  failure with EF of 20% to 30%, status post
pericardial  stripping,  prostatic mitral and tricuspid valve
placement   in   [**Month (only) 205**],   [**2123**]   for   valve  dysfunction  and
constriction  after radiation; ICD placement for nonsustained
VT  and  low  ER  inducible  VT.    The  patient was admitted
recently  with  shortness  of breath and pulmonary edema.  He
had respiratory distress, which was felt to be multifactorial
and  in part, due to MRSA pneumonia and CHF.  Hospital course
then   was  complicated  by  episodic  hypotension  requiring
transient   inotropic   and  pressor  support.    Hemodynamic
monitoring  was  not  possible  secondary  to  the prosthetic
tricuspid   valve.    Hemodynamics  using  showed  physiology
consistent  with  sepsis.   He improved with antibiotics, and
eventually  he  was  diuresed  and  afterload  reduced.   The
etiology  of  the  infection was thought to be pneumonia.  He
was  covered  broadly.    Cultures  were  negative except for
sputum  with  MRSA.    Pleural effusion was tapped and it was
transudative  with  on  evidence  of infection.  He has had a
chronically  low  hematocrit, which is multifactorial.  There
was  no  evidence  for  DIC.  He did have blood loss from the
left  femoral  artery puncture site and required transfusion,
bronchitic support, and blood loss anemia.

On  the  evening  of the 19th, he was found to be hypotensive
with  the  blood  pressures  in the 70s and poor oxygenation.
His chest x-ray showed CHF versus ARDS.  He developed a fever
to  101.2.   He was started on Dopamine.  He was sent to [**Hospital1 98139**] for further care.  He notes
increased sputum production, but no dyspnea or chest pain.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died from colon cancer.
No  history  of  coronary  artery  disease.    The patient is
married.    He  used  to self employed.  He does not smoke or
drink  alcohol.    He currently lives at [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
Center.

PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION:  The patient is resting comfortably in
bed in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 76/43
left  arm; 97/44 right arm.  Pulse 80.  Saturation 94% on 100
FIO2.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.    Extraocular  muscles  are intact; anicteric
sclerae.  Hearing aids are in place.  Moist mucous membranes.
Neck  was  supple  without  lymphadenopathy.   LUNGS:  Coarse
sounds  throughout;  no  wheezes or rhonchi.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
No  jugular  venous  distention.   Carotids normal with brisk
upstrokes, regular rate and rhythm.  Mechanical S1 and normal
S2;   no  rub  or  gallop.    ABDOMEN:    Abdomen  was  soft,
nondistended,    nontender,    normoactive    bowel   sounds.
EXTREMITIES:    Positive  pitting of the lower extremities of
thigh,  pitting  edema  in  the  arm,  markedly improved from
previous  hospitalization.    There was a well healed scar of
the  left arm, PIC in the right arm.  Dressings to both heels
decubitus  ulcers.    Chest:    Well  healed  scar,  muscular
chest-wall  defect  dressed.    Decubitus  on  sacrum  mildly
erythematous without obvious drainage.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory revealed the hematocrit of 23.4;
platelets  453,000,  white  blood  cell  count of 9.8 with no
bands;  sodium  134;  potassium 5.2; chloride 99; bicarbonate
26;  BUN  123;  creatinine  1.5;  glucose  116;  calcium 7.5;
magnesium  3.4; phosphorus 5.6; albumin 2.5; INR 1.3; PTT 32;
arterial  blood  gas  on  90%  with  FIO2  with  5-cm of PEEP
revealed the pO2 of 7.36, pCO2 of 49, pO2 of 56.  Chest x-ray
showed  diffuse  alveolar  filling  with  patchy interstitial
markings.    The  last echocardiogram revealed an EF of 25 to
35%   with   normal   valve   function;  severe  global  left
ventricular hypokinesis; mild right ventricular dilation.

HOSPITAL  COURSE:    Mr. [**Known lastname **] was treated simultaneously
for infectious pneumonic process, as well as congestive heart
failure.  For pneumonia he had initially received Vancomycin,
and  the  Zosyn.    He was extensively evaluated by the Heart
Failure  Team,  Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **]  for  management  of  his CHF and
possible  candidacy  for  heart transplant.  He was initially
tried  on  Milrinone,  but  failed secondary to hypertension.
Dopamine  was  tried with limited success in conjunction with
aggressive  bolus  Lasix  regimen.  Dopamine was discontinued
and we started using a combination of afterload reduction and
inotropic  support.  The patient did not successfully diurese
to  this  regimen.    Sputum  eventually showed polys with no
organisms,  but  grew  out  a  fairly  resistant Serratia and
Klebsiella   and  was  started  on  Imipenem.    However,  he
developed  a  rash  from  the  Imipenem and he was started on
Bactrim.     The  Bactrim  was  ultimately  discontinued.  He
remained   on   the  Dopamine  until  [**11-19**].    He  had  been
intermittently  tried on Dopamine, Dobutamine, and Lasix drip
with  again  limited  success in terms of diuresis.  Multiple
blood  transfusions  were given to support hematocrit greater
than  30.    His  renal  function intermittently improved and
worsened  based  on  the  degree  of  diuresis.  There was an
episode  of  acute  renal  failure during the week of [**11-10**],  probably secondary to hypotension after failed attempt
to  wean  Dopamine in conjunction with oncotic support in the
form  of  packed  red  blood cells and Lasix.  Renal function
returned closer to baseline of 2.

Multiple  trials  of  trach-mask were attempted, however, the
patient   did  not  have  the  cardiac  function  to  support
spontaneous  ventilation  and  eventually tired.  He has been
intermittently  using between 10 to 20-cm of pressure support
in conjunction with 5-cm to 10-cm of PEEP and an FIO2 ranging
between .4 and 1.

The Dopamine was eventually weaned to off on [**11-29**] and
21st  with  just  Dobutamine and Lasix.  The patient diuresed
fairly successfully 3-4 liters over a [**3-6**] day period.

Access  had  been  a  difficult  issue secondary to extensive
bleeding  in  the  femoral  region  in  the  past.    A right
subclavian was attempted, but failed.  Right internal jugular
complicated  by  arterial  puncture  and a PICC line had been
placed in the right arm, which is functioning at this point.

Over  the  week  of  [**11-12**] to [**11-19**], the patient was tried on
trach-mask trials.  However, this in conjunction with changes
in  the
