Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, rigors

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
68 F w/ metastatic NSCLC, known mets to brain s/p whole brain
[**First Name3 (LF) 16859**] for numerous foci and s/p craniotomy for R temporal lobe
mass resection [**2149-4-10**] who was found to be more somnolent at
rehab.

Tumor hx includes a mediastinoscopy and biopsy followed by
carboplatin and Taxol for 8 cycles. She developed right facial
droop in summer [**2148**] and a head MRI showed 5 enhancing lesions
suggestive of brain metastases. She then received whole brain
cranial irradiation from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D. She then developed
right lower extremity swelling caused by a deep vein thrombosis.
She then developed a R temporal lobe mass w/ surrounding edema
that was felt to be not amenable to [**Last Name (LF) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] surgery was
performed [**4-10**] for palliation. Pt w/ post-op dysarthria.
Discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab [**2149-4-15**].

Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented from [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**2149-5-1**] with fever
to 103 and rigors. On presentation, pt was noted to be poor
historian, but denied fever; reported dyspnea, cough, chest pain
(states has had in past, not new), rigors, x 1 day. Denied
headaches, back pain.

In ED febrile to 102.8. CXR showed RML and RLL infiltrate; CT
suggestive of post-obstructive PNA on R. Mildly hypoxemic and
borderline BP ~100. Received decadron 10 mg IV in ED.

Patient was admitted to MICU initially for management. She was
treated with zosyn and vancomycin for a post-obstructive pna. A
bronchoscopy with stent placement was considered, but position
of obstruction not ideal for stenting, and pt's clinical
condition improved with antibiotics alone. She currently is
stable on NC oxygen, hemodynamically stable. She is therefore
transferred to floor (OMED service).
.
On admission to the OMED service, the patient is again a poor
hisotrian. Review of systems was difficult to obtain, but the
patient does complain of a sore throat.

CTA CHEST ([**2149-5-1**]):
1. Large right hilar mass consistent with known history of lung
cancer invading adjacent mediastinal structures. Mass narrowss
the bronchus intermedius and occludes the right upper lobe
bronchus. There is near complete consolidation of the entire
right middle and right lower lobes.
2. Probable metastatic nodules in the left lower lobe and right
upper lobe. Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

CXR ([**2149-5-1**]):
1) New large right middle and lower lobe consolidation,
aspiration or pneumonia, with small left- sided pleural effusion
representing atelectasis vs pneumonia.
2) Right paratracheal density corresponds to lung mass on same-
day CT.

CT HEAD ([**2149-5-2**]):
There appears to be a small amount of subarachnoid blood
remaining in the posterior right frontal lobe. There appears
resolution in the minimal mass effect. There has been resolution
over the previously noted areas of hemorrhage. The remainder of
the exam is stable.

ECHO ([**2149-5-7**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Post obstructive pneumonia:  Patient presented with fevers,
rigors, dyspnea, cough, hypotension found to have large RML and
RLL post obstructive pneumonia on CXR and Chest CT.  Urine
culture were negative and blood cultures showed no growth as
well.  Once on Zosyn and Vancomycin, she initially showed
clinical improvement with stable hemodynamics.  Pulmonology was
constuled to determine if a bronchoscopy and possible stend
would be worthwhile.  It was felt that the area of pneumonia did
not have a large blockage in the upstream bronchus and that the
bronchus that appeared obstructed did not have an associated
pneumonia.  Given this, it was their feelign that stent
placement would be of little value.  On the evening of [**2149-5-6**],
the patient was found to be acutely hypoxic to the low 90%s with
a NRB mask.  She was intubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and anesthesia noted
food in her oropharynx suggestive of an aspiration event.  She
underwent bronchoscopy in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2149-5-7**] which showed no
evidence of bronchial obstruction.  A right IJ CVL was placed
for monitoring and medication administration on [**2149-5-7**].  The
patient was empirically treated with vanco/Zosyn/azithromycin
but, in spite of these antibiotics, her respiratory failure
continued to worsen and she developed ARDS and septic shock.
She required vasopressin and norepinephrine for blood pressure
support but developed progressively worsening oliguria.  After
numerous discussions with the family, they chose to make her DNR
and, eventually, comfort-measures-only given the severity of her
ARDS and septic shock in the setting of her advanced lung
cancer.  She was put on a morphine drip for comfort and exp
