([**4-20**]) CT COLONOGRAPHY: There is adequate distention of the
colon between the three positions. There are no strictures,
masses, or polyps. A moderate amount of fluid is seen throughout
the colon; however, this displaces with repositioning and does
not interfere with interpretation. There are a few scattered
diverticula are noted at the splenic flexure, the descending
colon and the cecum.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN [**4-24**]: The liver is without focal lesions. The
spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and right kidney are
unremarkable. There is a low-density lesion in the left kidney,
which on prior CT examination has been demonstrated to represent
a cyst. There is an aortic aneurysm, better evaluated on the
recent CT scan.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no free fluid in
the pelvis. No pelvic lymphadenopathy is noted. The small bowel
is unremarkable.

On bone windows, there are no concerning osteolytic or
osteosclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal CT colonography. No evidence for masses or polyps.
Scattered
sigmoid diverticulosis. Please note that the sensitivity of CT
colonography for polyps greater than 1 cm is over 90%.
Sensitivity for polyps 5-9 mm is 70-80%. Flat lesions may be
missed.

2. Fusiform aneurysm of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, better
evaluated on the recent CTA of the torso.

([**4-22**]) ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. Q waves in leads III and aVF.
Poor R wave progression. Consider prior inferior myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2122-4-15**] no
diagnostic interval change.

([**4-15**]) CTA: The aortic arch measures 3.1 cm in transverse
dimension, stable. The mid descending thoracic aorta measures
3.9 x 3.9 cm, stable from prior exam.  Starting at the distal
descending thoracic aorta and extending through the abdominal
aorta to just distal to the level of the renal arteries is
fusiform dilation of the aorta with maximal dimension of 6.6 x
7.0 cm at the level of the origin of the SMA. Above this level,
there is complex septation along the aorta with mural thrombus
and areas of presumed ulcerative plaque. Given the lobulated
margins of the descending thoracic aorta, specifically seen on
series 3, image 65, the possibility of a penetrating
atheromatous ulcer cannot be excluded though overall
configuration is stable. There is no periaortic hematoma or
evidence of aortic rupture. No evidence of aortoenteric fistula.

The celiac, SMA, and renal arteries opacify normally. There is
tortuosity of the distal abdominal aorta with ectasia of the
common iliacs and areas of atherosclerotic plaque noted
primarily involving the left common iliac artery. Also noted is
a right superficial femoral artery aneurysm which measures up to
1.8 cm in dimension, similar to prior exam. There is thrombosis
of the right CSA stent seen on series 3, image 225, unchanged.

CHEST: Nodular enlargement of the thyroid, left greater than
right, is
unchanged and compatible with a goiter. There is associated mass
effect on
the proximal segment of the esophagus. There is no mediastinal,
hilar, or
axillary lymphadenopathy. The esophagus is moderately distended
containing
fluid, mid and distally. Heart size is stably enlarged. No
pleural or
pericardial effusion is seen. Coronary artery calcification and
calcification of the mitral annulus and aortic valve is also
noted. Central pulmonary arterial tree opacifies nor
