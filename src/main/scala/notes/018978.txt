Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted and brought to the operating room for sternal
debridement. He was transferred to the cardiac ICU paralyzed and
sedated with an open chest, requiring pressors for BP control.
Over the next several days the plastic surgery and ID services
were consulted. He was weaned from some of his pressor support
and on POD5 a wound vac was placed, following which he was able
to be weaned from his paralytics and pressor support.
He returned to the OR for further  debridement on [**10-20**], and
again a VAC was placed.
On POD 19 the family asked that the patient be supported with
comfrt measures only.
At 16:46 the pt expired
