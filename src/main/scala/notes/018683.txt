CT Abdomen [**2188-5-26**]
COMPARISON: [**2188-5-25**] CT abdomen and pelvis and chest
radiograph of [**5-26**], [**2187**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained through the chest
without IV
contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were displayed.

FINDINGS: The imaged thyroid gland is normal. There is no
axillary,
mediastinal, or hilar adenopathy meeting CT criteria for
pathologic
enlargement. A left-sided central venous line follows a normal
course
terminating at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein with the
SVC. The
heart is enlarged with trace pericardial fluid. Small hiatal
hernia is
present.

There is a new right-sided pigtail catheter terminating at the
base of the
right lung. Loculated pleural effusion is slightly increased
compared to the
prior study. For example, a collection of fluid at the base
measures 2.6 cm
in maximal width compared to 2.1 cm previously. Gas within the
pleural fluid
is presumably secondary to placement of the pigtail catheter. A
loculated
component of fluid anteriorly measures 5.6 x 11.2 cm. A third
component of
fluid along the right lateral chest measures approximately 4.4 x
2.1 cm. A
small collection of gas within a consolidation at the right lung
base adjacent
to the effusion is similar to prior and concerning for pneumonia
or
necrotizing pneumonia. There is peribronchial thickening. A 5-mm
nodule in the
right lower lobe is not appreciably changed from the prior study
(2:26). A
second nodule measuring 3 mm is seen at the right lung base
(2:33). There is
a small left pleural effusion.

In the visualized upper abdomen, the gallbladder is distended up
to 4.5 cm
with sludge. a fat-containing abdominal wall hernia is
incompletely evaluated.
Hypodensity in the upper pole of the left kidney is better
evaluated on the
prior CT abdomen.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is
identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter with
slight increase
in the loculated pleural effusion which could
