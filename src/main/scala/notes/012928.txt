Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
cholangitis s/p [**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) **] s/p gall bladder stent placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo female with multiple medical problems including type 2
diabetes, CVA, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, atrial
fibrillation, and CHF was admitted from the [**Age over 90 **] suite s/p [**Age over 90 **]
for cholangitis.

She initially presented to the OSH with a mechanical fall for
which she was found to have a right hip fracture. Surgical
repair of her hip was delayed due to multiple complicating
medical issues, including parotiditis, cholecystitis, and
urinary tract infection. Regarding her parotiditis, she
developed a right parotiditis on [**2186-4-26**] for which she was
evaluated by ENT. They drained her right parotid gland which
grew staph aureus and she was started on vancomycin. Regarding
her cholecystitis, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital1 **] and
received rocephin and flagyl. Regarding her urinary tract
infection, she was started on rocephin. She was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] urgently for an [**Hospital1 **].

[**Hospital1 **] demonstrated a "filling defect that appeared like
sludge/stone in the lower third of the common bile duct. A
moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD
measuring 15mm" and a stent was placed. Her procedure was
performed under MAC and was relatively uncomplicated. Upon
arrival to the floor, she reports mild abdominal pain and
fatigue.

fracture site. There is generalized osteopenia. No additional
fractures are seen.

Final Report
HISTORY: Right foot swelling.
Three radiographs of the right foot demonstrate air projecting
along the
dorsum of the forefoot, seen on all three views. Assessment of
the finding is markedly limited by overlying dressing material.
Mild, diffuse,
demineralization limits assessment for osseous fragmentation,
none is seen.  There is evidence of ovoid lucencies involving
the second and third metatarsal shafts. Mild degenerative change
involves the first MTP joint. No tibiotalar joint effusion is
seen.
IMPRESSION:
Air projecting over the dorsum of the forefoot. The finding
likely represents subcutaneous emphysema, although assessment is
markedly limited by overlying dressing material.
Equivocal lucencies involving the second and third metatarsal
shafts. This
finding might also be attributable to the overlying air, but
osseous lesions are not excluded.
These findings would be better assessed with cross-sectional
imaging. CT
examination would better delineate the extent of air and
potential cortical destruction. MRI might be more useful for
evaluation of the regional soft tissues.

[**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital1 **] Report:
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla
Cannulation: Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome. Contrast medium was injected
resulting in complete opacification. A 0.035in in diameter and
260cm in length straight tip glidewire was placed. The existing
guidewire was replaced with a jagwire.

Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was successful and
superficial with a sphincterotome. Contrast medium was injected
resulting in partial opacification.

Biliary Tree: There was a filling defect that appeared like
sludge/stone in the lower third of the common bile duct. A
moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD
measuring 15mm. The cystic duct appeared patent. Two stones were
visualized in the gall bladder. Full cholangiogram not obtained
due to patient's history of cholangitis. A 10FR by 8 cm Cotton
[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully.
Pancreas: A moderate dilation of the main pancreatic duct was
seen in the head of the pancreas.
Impression: There was a filling defect that appeared like
sludge/stone in the lower third of the common bile duct.

CBD measuring 15mm.
The cystic duct appeared patent. Two stones were visualized in
the gall bladder.
A 10FR by 8 cm Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed
successfully.
A moderate dilation of the main pancreatic duct was seen in the
head of the pancreas
