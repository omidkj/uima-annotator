Brief Hospital Course:
68yo M bib EMS to [**Hospital1 18**] trauma bay.  Given thorough evaluation
in trauma bay by trauma and ED staff.  Was emergently intubated
for airway protection secondary to agitation.  Head CT revealed
R EDH, SDH, and SAH with intraparenchymal bleed.  Pt admitted to
Trauma-SICU.  Neurosurgery consult obtained with rec for SBP
control, dilantin, and hourly neuro checks.  Ortho consult
obtained for multiple fx's; no acute surgical issue present.

Pt had L cordis placed on HD 1.  Given banana bag, CIWA protocol
for h/o EtOH abuse; EtOh level 133, other tox negative.  Given
stress dose steroid with taper to home dose equivalent, and
Kefzol.  Hct dropped to 20 and pt given 2U PRBCs, subsequently
stabilized to high-20's.

Begun on TF via NGT.  Repeat Head CT stable.  Resumed on home
meds for cardiac and IBD.  Vent weaning initiated but limited by
patient agitation.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8745**] bolt was placed on HD 4 for pt cont
to not follow commands and become agitated.  The following day
the ICP rose to 30 and the bolt was changed to a drain by
neurosurgery.  Pt spiked a fever to 101 on HD 5, pancultures
were negative.  A neurology consult was obtained.  MRI confirmed
the initial Head CT findings, and a repeat Head CT showed no
changes.  An EEG on HD 6 showed diffused marked and severe
encephalopathy and pt begun on depakote.

Pt continue to spike fever to 101.4, repeat cultures were again
negative, as was CDiff. On HD 9 LENIs were obtained for
persistent fever of  unknown origin, but were negative.  On HD
12 the had a tracheostomy and PEG tube inserted.  The pt
remained stable until HD 14 when the ICP monitor was removed.
On HD 15 a CTA of the chest was obtained for persistent
tachypnea showing bilateral small PEs.  Neurosurgery requested
no anticoagulation or IVC filter be used unless the emboli were
immediately life threatening.  On HD 16 a culture of the pt's
A-line tip grew out MRSA, and Vancomycin was started.  On HD 17
([**2167-12-20**]) the pt was transferred to the floor.  He continuted to
do well on the floor with occaisional episodes of agitation.  On
[**2167-12-22**] a behavioral neurology consult was obtained and the pt
was started on Seroquel and Trazodone with excellent improvement
of agitiation.  He remained stable until discharge on [**2167-12-24**].
