CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2179-8-27**] 3:49 PM
FINDINGS:
There are bibasal effusions with consolidation in the right
lower lobe. The heart and mediastinum appear unremarkable. There
is a TIPS catheter in the right upper quadrant.
The focal opacity in the right lower lobe may represent an early
pneumonia or aspiration.

DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL Study Date of [**2179-8-27**] 4:26 PM
Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] for TIPS evaluation demonstrate two TIPS, one
of
them is completely occluded, the second one has appropriate
wall-to-wall flow with velocities ranging from 94-155 cm/sec,
considerably higher than prior study, suggesting in stent
stenosis.

REVISN HEPATIC SHUNT TIPS Study Date of [**2179-8-30**] 2:41
IMPRESSION:
1. Pre-angioplasty portal venogram demonstrating focal stenosis
of the distal (hepatic vein end) aspect of the TIPS shunt.
2. Angioplasty with 10 x 40 mm balloon with improved flow on
post-angioplasty portal venogram.
3. Drop in portosystemic gradient from 19 mmHg to 9 mmHg.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo M with Ethanol Induced Cirrhosis, Upper GI bleed s/p TIPS
who was admitted for hematemesis.

#  Hematemesis: The patient was admitted to the ICU.  On initial
presentation in the ED, vitals were 98.7, 129/73, 82, 18, 97%
RA. He was found to be guaiac negative. He had hypokalemia which
was repleted, and he had an abdominal US with Dopplers to
evaluate his TIPS which was initially reported to be patent.  He
was given pantoprazole 40 mg IV x 1 and Zofran x 1. He was then
transferred to the MICU for further evaluation. In the MICU, he
was started on an octreotide gtt. Serial hematocrits were
monitored and were stable not requiring any transfusions. He had
no further episodes of vomiting and was tolerating clears
without difficulty. His octreotide gtt was discontinued and he
was transferred to the Hepatorenal service.

# Ethanol Induced Cirrhosis: The patient had a history of TIPs
and these were evaluated on admission.  Although initially
reported as patent, repeat review showed evidence of stenosis
and the patient underwent a successful TIPs revision.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, tolerating
a regular diet and was without pain.  He was discharged with
follow-up in the [**Hospital **] clinic.

# Pneumonia: A chest x-ray in the ED was concerning for a RLL
infiltrate suspicious for a pneumonia or aspiration.  The
patient was started on Levaquin.  He received a 5 day course of
antibiotics.  The patient was afebrile and without evidence of
pneumonia at discharge.

# Diabetic Neuropathy:  The patient's initial presentation
appeared to be related to cymbalta which the patient was
prescribed for treatment diabetic neuropathy of his feet.  The
patient was started on Amitriptyline as an alternative
medication.  The patient responded well to this therapy and was
given instructions to follow-up with his primary care physician
regarding maintenance of this medication.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for concern for nausea, vomiting and
gastrointestinal bleeding.  You did not have any bleeding while
in the hospital.  Your nausea improved and appeared to be
realated to taking Cymbalta. Given your history of espohageal
bleeding, an ultrasound of your liver was performed which showed
your TIPS was occluded.  This was corrected with a TIPS revision
procedure.  You are have follow-up with the liver center on
[**9-14**].  Please attend this appointment as scheduled.

In addition, you will need re-evaluation of your TIPS with an
outpatient ultrasound.  This was scheduled for the same day as
your Liver center appointment ([**9-14**]).  This is scheduled
for 10:30AM.  You cannot eat or drink after midnight the evening
prior to this study.

On your admission, you appeared to have a pneumonia.  You have
completed a 7 day course of antibiotics.  You do not appear to
have any ongoing symptoms but you should follow-up with your
primary care physician.
