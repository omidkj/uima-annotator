CT C-Spine [**12-19**]:
1. [**Location (un) 5621**]-type fracture of C1.
2. Type III comminuted fracture of C2 with posterior angulation
of the superior fracture fragment and likely epidural hematoma
narrowing the spinal canal, likely compressing the spinal cord.
Extension of fracture lines into the transverse foramen
bilaterally.

MRA [**12-20**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of arterial dissection.
Atherosclerotic plaque causing more than 90% stenosis at the
origin of left internal carotid artery.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 76090**] [**12-20**]: IMPRESSION:
1. [**Location (un) 5621**] type C1 fracture and comminuted type III C2
fracture as described above.
2. Prevertebral swelling from C2-C4.
3. No evidence of cord signal abnormalities or cord compression.

[**12-24**] CT Chest IMPRESSION:
1. Predominantly left lower lobe pneumonia with small RLL
component and scattered peribronchovascular ground-glass
opacities within the remaining lobes likely also
infectious/inflammatory in etiology. Presence of secretions
within the distal trachea and proximal mainstem bronchi raises
suspicion for aspiration as the underlying etiology.

2. Hypoattenuating right thyroid lesion likely represents a
benign nodule. This can be evaluated with a dedicated ultrasound
on non-emergent basis.

3. Mild atherosclerotic disease within the left coronary
circulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Trauma ICU under the trauma
team.  He was evaluated with CT of the head adn torso for
further injuries.  The patient was found to have a C1-2 fracture
(for more details, see report), for which neurosurgery was
consulted.   The patient received dexamethasone, and had
frequent neurochecks for evaluation of any changes in his
neurological status.  The patient's blood pressure was
controlled on lopressor, and his oxygenation status was
constantly monitored.

On [**12-20**], otolaryngology was consulted to evaluate the patient's
airway, as the patient began experiencing changes in his voice
with copious secretions.  After fiberoptic examination, it was
felt that the patient's airway must be secured by intubation as
the patient had pooling of secretions, and pharyngeal wall
edema.
Anesthesia was called for nasopharyngeal fiberoptic intubation,
which was completed without complication.  The patient was
extubated on [**12-21**], and did well without any difficulty
protecting his airway.  The patient was noted, however to have a
pneumonia prior to discharge for which he was put on
levofloxacin for a 2 week course; a CT of the chest.  The
patient remained afebrile, with adequate cough, and was stable
for discharge to rehab with continued antibiotics.

As for the patient's neurologic status, a CT c-spine was
repeated, and and MRI/MRV/MRA was performed to evaluate for
epidural hematoma, cord contusion, and vascular injury.
Neurosurgery recommended a Halo, which was subsequently placed
at the bedside without further complications on [**12-21**].  The
patient was evaluated radiographically and found to have good
head alignment.

When appropriate followin extubation, the patient's diet was
advanced, his oxygen was weaned, and the patient was evaluated
and treated by physical and occupational therapy.   He also had
a nutrition consult for proper supplementation if necessary.
The patient was put on DVT and GI prophylaxis throughout his
stay.
