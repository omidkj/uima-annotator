Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo F NH resident with hx of chronic steroid use p/w fevers,
hypotension, hypoxia, nausea and vomiting. Clinically, she had
sepsis with shock since she has fevers, hypoxia, hypotension and
suspected sources are pulmonary.
.
# Septic Shock: Given that she had such a high fever at the NH,
her cough, and new pulmonary infiltrate, suspicion was high for
PNA or influenza. In addition, her n/v and neck stiffness was
worrisome for meningitis. Initially treated for PNA with IV
antibiotics.  Pt was given vanc/levo/ceftriaxone in ED.  She had
a central line placed.  CVP was monitored with goal of [**9-26**] was
maintained with IVF, she required ~12L in the first 36 hours.
She was also started on levophed which was titrated to map>60
and weaned off.  Pt on steroids at home and was given stress
dose steroids since she is stereoid.  Sputum, blood cultures and
urine legionella ag and DFA for influenza were negative.  Her
antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin in ICU.
 She defervesced quickly and was transferred to the floor.  She
continued to improve on the floor, and her sputum grew minimal
numbers of MRSA.  She was then continued on vancomycin only, and
she remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable and w/o
leukocytosis.  She will complete 6 more days of vancomycin for a
total of 15 days.  She will also continue to titrate down her
steroids slowly back to her home dose of 10mg per day.
.
# Volume status - No history of heart failure, initially pt with
low cvp and given aggressive IVF as above.  On HD3, pt noted to
have bilateral crackles on exam thought likely due to aggressive
volume repletion.  IVF was discontinued and pt was given 20 IV
lasix prior to transfer to floor for diuresis as this was
thought to be contributing to some hypoxia (pt on 2L O2 on
transfer).  Prior to discharge, pt did not appear to be volume
overloaded on exam, she was breathing >93% on RA, and her I/O
were even.  Daughter requested ECHO as inpt but given her
clinical picture, emergent ECHO was not indicated at this time.
Will defer to PCP to schedule ECHO if warranted.
.
# prolonged PTT - pt noted to have oozing from central line; PTT
elevated at 110 w/ normal INR w/o obvious etiology.  She has
only received heparin sc 5000u tid and flushes through CL.  She
does not have a history of lupus.  Repeat coags drawn from
peripheral draw showed PTT of 70.  She had minimal oozing from
PICC placed later in the day.  Checked stat coags which showed
prolonged PTT of 44, 9 hours after last heparin exposure.  She
did not have further bleeding and PTT normalized by the next
day.  Restarted heparin flushes and would give SC heparin only
when pt is not ambulating.  Would recommend checking coags in
the week after discharge to ensure she does not have prolonged
PTT.  Pt has inhibitor study pending - this should be followed
up by PCP.
.
# Anemia: Pt has a history of iron defiency anemia and on iron
at home, however, she dropped 8 HCT points since admission.
There was no clear source of bleeding.  Likely lab error vs.
hemodilution. Hct remained stable thereafter.
.
# Polymyositis: methotrexate held as pt had pneumosepsis - will
defer to rheumatologist to restart as needed.
.
# Chronic Pain: Reduced her fentanyl patch to 50mcg q72hrs;
continued neurontin, and percocet prn - she reported good pain
relief and remained alert and appropriate prior to discharge.
.
# Schizophrenia: continued Geodon and Klonapin
.
# Hypothryoidism: Continued synthroid
.
# FEN: regular diet
.
# Ppx: Hep SC if pt not ambulating, already takes PPI, skin
protection with regular turning.
.
# Lines: R SCL plaed in ED
