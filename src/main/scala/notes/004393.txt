CR CHEST ([**2104-10-16**]):
1. Mild generalized bronchitis. Study did not include assessment
of small
airway obstruction.
2. No lung nodule other than calcified granuloma.
3. Top normal size ascending thoracic aorta could be related to
aortic
stenosis in the presence of aortic valvular calcification.
Clinical
correlation advised.
4. Atherosclerotic calcification predominantly aorta, head and
neck vessels
and splenic artery, not coronaries.
5. Transfusion related hyper-attenuation in the liver and
splenomegaly.
6. Suggest ultrasound to exclude thyroid nodule.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST 11/1/08IMPRESSION:
1. High-grade large bowel obstruction with a transition point
located at the
level of distal descending colon near the prior site of surgical
anastomosis.
Possible etiologies include colorectal carcinoma recurrence,
post surgical
stricture or diverticular disease..
2. No lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. No other site of
recurrence is noted.
3. Fibroid uterus.
4. Unchanged 3mm right middle lobe nodule.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Bronchitis: Patient admited with neutropenic fever. She
received neupogen and was started on cefepime. Azythromicin was
added for concern for atypical bacteria with CAP. CXR was
unremarkable, but CT scan was suggestive of bronchitis. Cefepime
was stopped in day 2, when patient's ANC >1000, and pt completed
a 5-day course of Azythromycin. Patient's cough improved.
Patient did not require oxygen and is being discharged breathing
comfortably in room air.
.
#. Aplastic anemia: Patient with HCT <25, will get blood. [**Month (only) 116**] do
ATG/CSA when patient recovers from surgery. Pt's HCT was
followed in the hospital requiring multiple transfussions (6
RBC). Patient's platelets are in low range 15-40,000 range
during hosptialization and required 2 units in the peri-surgical
days.
.
#. Abdominal obstruction: Pt with abdominal distention and
decreased bowel sounds and CT scan showed complete obstruction
of the descending colon, close to prior surgery site. Was taken
to the OR in [**10-18**]. Perioperatively, she received both packed
red blood cells and platelets. Following an uncomplicated
exploratory laparotomy,lysis of adhesions, and transverse loop
colostomy, the patient was admitted to the surgical ICU for
further management. She was transferred to the floor on [**10-21**].
Primary care was transferred to the BMT service on [**10-23**]. Patient
will need close follow up and work up for recurrent colonic
cancer.
