Pertinent Results:
CT chest:
Innumberable 1-2mm wide nodules, many centrilobular, are
scattered through the lungs, more profuse in some regions than
on prior studies.
There is no pleural effusion. Atelectais is present in the
dependent portions of both lungs. The heart demonstrates left
ventricular dilatation. The great vessels are normal in size.
Bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is stable.
Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy is again noted and unchanged.
There is a stable left thyroid lobe nodule.
No bone findings suspicious for malignancy.
The study is not designed for the subdiaphragmatic evaluation
except to note a
26 x 23 mm hypodense lesion in the left lobe of the liver with
peripheral enhancement, likely a hemangioma.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patchy ground-glass opacity in the anterior segment of the
left upper lobe, just above the lingula may represent an acute
infectious process including PCP.
2. 11 x 8 mm nodule in the left lower lobe. Followup CT in three
months is recommended to document stability.
3. Bilateral [**Year (4 digits) **] small nodules in the range of [**1-6**] mm in a
peribronchial distribution. Differential diagnosis includes
peribronchial granulomas from inhalation of foreign substances,
sarcoid although not typical in distribution, and chronic
lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.
4. Stable 2.6 x 2.3 cm hepatic hemangioma.

Sputum AFB negative x 3, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5963**].  Fungal markers negative.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)Pneumonia: Pt was admitted with pneumonia, started on
Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin. Induced sputum AFB and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5963**].
Discharged on Levofloxacin with plan to continue for 7 more
days.

2)Thrush:  Patient states that nystatin had not worked for her
in the past and so she was treated with fluconazole.

3)Back pain:  CT abd to r/o renal infart was unchanged.  Back
pain was clinically consistent with musculo skeletal pain.

4)HIV:  Follow up scheduled this week with infectious disease
team.  ID team followed her throughout hospital course.  She is
not on HAART or prophylactic antibiotics.

5)Anticardiolopin ab syndrome:  Pt's INR was therapuetic on
admission, was initially given doses she reported that she took
at home, but as her INR drifted down on these doses, she was
re-questioned, and admitted that she had forgotten that she had
more recently been on a higher dose of coumadin 4 mg po qd,
advised by [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital **] clinic.  Her dose was increased to
coumadin 5 mg po qd, no interactions with levofloxacin, and she
was advised to have her INR checked within one week.

6)Depression/anxiety: Patient was started on Prozac and ativan
bridge, showed great improvement.  Follow up to be made with
PCP.
