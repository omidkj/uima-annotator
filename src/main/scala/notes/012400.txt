Date of Birth:   [**2061-4-8**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old
gentleman who has a past medical history of atrial
fibrillation (on Coumadin) who had been complaining of back
pain for about one week.

The patient reported that he awoke at about 1 a.m. on
[**2-27**] with upper chest and throat pain and pounding in
his chest.

The patient was taken to the Emergency Room where he
underwent a computed tomography scan which showed a type 1
aortic dissection with a large hematoma without obvious
pleural or pericardial effusion.  The patient was taken
emergently to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
repair of the type 1 aortic dissection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Atrial fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Preoperative medications included
verapamil, flecainide, and Coumadin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On initial physical
examination, the patient was alert, awake, and oriented times
three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.
Strength was [**5-7**] in the upper and lower extremities
bilaterally.  Heart revealed normal first heart sounds and
second heart sounds.  No third heart sounds or fourth heart
sounds.  No murmurs.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft and nontender.
Extremities with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses and radial pulses
bilaterally.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken
emergently to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
repair of his type 1 aortic dissection.  The patient
underwent a super coronary arch graft with resuspension of
the aortic valve with a 26-mm gel weave and a coronary artery
bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery.  Total bypass time was 193 minutes.
Cross-clamp time was 119 minutes.  Please see the Operative
Note for further details.

The patient was transported to the Intensive Care Unit on
dobutamine, Levophed, and propofol drips.  Upon arrival to
the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was noted to be in
ventricular fibrillation requiring multiple attempts at
cardioversion.  Amiodarone and lidocaine boluses were given
per advanced cardiac life support protocol.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
at the bedside.  The patient was subsequently resuscitated
and returned to a stable rhythm.

The patient was initially coagulopathic with a moderate
amount of bleeding from his chest tubes requiring multiple
blood products and protamine to reverse his coagulopathy.

On postoperative day one, the patient remained intubated on a
low-dose epinephrine and Levophed drip as well as a lidocaine
drip.  The patient's hemodynamics showed adequate cardiac
output with gas exchange.  The patient's sedation was weaned
on postoperative day one, and the patient moved all
extremities to command and nodded his head appropriately to
questions.  The propofol was restarted as the patient's blood
pressure and oxygen saturations varied with the propofol off.
The lidocaine infusion was decreased from 3 mg per minute to
2 mg per minute.  The Levophed was weaned off.  The patient
was continued on epinephrine.  The patient continued on
mechanical ventilation with adequate gas exchange.

The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation on postoperative day two.  He initially required
a significant amount of pulmonary toilet.  The patient was
noted to be in a junctional rhythm and was A-paced at a rate
of 70.  The epinephrine was weaned off.  The patient was
continued on a lidocaine infusion.  The patient was started
on hydralazine for blood pressure control.

On postoperative day three, the patient was noted
intermittently to be in atrial fibrillation, rate controlled,
and then converted into a paced rhythm at 70.  The lidocaine
drip was discontinued.  The patient was started on
amiodarone.

On postoperative day four, the patient began to ambulate in
the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient continued to have a
junctional rhythm and intermittent atrial fibrillation.  The
patient was continued on Lopressor and amiodarone.

On postoperative day six, because of the patient's continued
atrial fibrillation versus a junctional rhythm, a discussion
was undertaken with the patient's cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about appropriate treatment of the atrial
fibrillation, and it was decided that the patient was no
longer a candidate for anticoagulation.  Attempt should be
made to keep the patient out of atrial fibrillation.

With the patient's demonstrated intolerance of both beta
blocker and amiodarone, it was decided to consult the
Electrophysiology Service for a question of a implantation of
a pacemaker.  The Electrophysiology Service recommended
discontinuing the beta blocker and increasing the patient's
amiodarone.

On postoperative day seven, the patient had converted back
into rapid atrial fibrillation.  The patient was restarted on
Lopressor.  The patient continued to progress from a Physical
Therapy standpoint.  On postoperative day seven, the patient
was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular
part of the hospital.  The Electrophysiology Service felt the
patient should wait another couple of days to see of the
patient regained his own sinus rhythm.

On postoperative day eight, the Electrophysiology Service
decided that cardioversion for the patient's atrial
fibrillation to see if he could maintain a sinus rhythm.  The
patient was taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory and
cardioverted on [**3-6**].  The patient converted into a sinus
rhythm with a rate of 50 to 60.

On the morning on postoperative day nine, the patient
converted back into atrial fibrillation with rates of 100 to
110s.  It was decided that the patient would be taken for a
pacemaker insertion.

The patient was taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory
where a [**Company 1543**] dual-chamber pacemaker (serial number
[**Serial Number 109862**]) was inserted in the right side.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  In the Pacemaker Laboratory,
it was noted that the patient had high right-sided filling
pressures.  It was recommended by the Electrophysiology
Service that the patient undergo an aggressive amiodarone
load.  The patient was returned to the floor in stable
condition with AV pacing, which he tolerated well.  The
patient was started on aggressive diuretics, and his
peripheral edema continued to decrease over the next couple
of days.

On postoperative day ten, the patient was noted to be quite
dyspneic.  The patient was given extra doses of Lasix.

By postoperative day fourteen, it was felt that the patient
had undergone sufficient diuresis and was stable from a
Physical Therapy standpoint and could be discharged to home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: Temperature maximum was
98.2, his pulse was 70 (AV-paced), his blood pressure was
112/69, his respiratory rate was 17, and his oxygen
saturation was 97% on room air.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  Laboratory data
revealed his white blood cell count was 9, his hematocrit was
31.8, and his platelet count was 409.  Sodium was 137,
potassium was 4.4, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 28,
blood urea nitrogen was 36, creatinine was 1.5, and blood
glucose was 75.  Neurologically, the patient was alert,
awake, and oriented times three; nonfocal.  Heart was regular
in rate and rhythm without rubs or murmurs.  Respiratory
examination revealed breath sounds were clear bilaterally,
decreased at the left base.  Gastrointestinal examination
revealed the abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There were positive bowel sounds.  The sternal
incision was open to air.  The staples had been discontinued.
There was no erythema or drainage.  The sternum was stable.
Left lower extremity Steri-Strips were intact.  There was no
erythema or drainage.  The bilateral lower extremities had 2
to 3+ pitting edema (left greater than
