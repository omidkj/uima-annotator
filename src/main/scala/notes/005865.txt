Seizure and Hemorrhage

Intubation
Arterial line placement bilaterally.


History of Present Illness:
50 year-old man with a history of HTN, chol, right parietal
infarct [**8-13**], s/p R CEA (stenosis 80%) [**2128-9-30**], admitted to
[**Hospital **] Hospital [**2128-10-3**] with status epilepticus and worsening
left hemiparesis ([**Doctor Last Name 555**] vs new stroke), then with decreasing
alertness [**10-6**] and repeat CT with parieto-occipital hemorrhage.

Pt presented in [**8-13**] with left hemiparesis, had right parietal
infarct, and recovered well with only mild residual hemiparesis.
Workup revealed an 80% R ICA stenosis. He was discharged on ASA,
lipitor and coumadin. He then underwent R CEA on [**2128-9-30**],
without
complications and was discharged on [**10-1**].

On [**2128-10-3**], family observed clonic movements of left arm
followed
by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at home. No h/o headache
or
head injury. EMS arrived and en route to [**Hospital **] Hospital he had
another GTC lasting 2.5 minutes, and was given valium 5mg IMx1,
and he became combative and restless. He was intubated for
airway
protection, given morphine, ativan and 1gm fosphenytoin with
good
effect and resolution of seziures. Etiology of seizures was
unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 430**] CT at that time showed only old right parietal
stroke. Bilateral carotid ultrasound without stenosis. On exam,
he had worsened left hemiparesis, unclear if due to [**Name (NI) 555**] vs
new
right-sided stroke. Head CT [**10-5**] unchanged, and CTA neck without
carotid disease. Pt was never stable enough for MRI.

On [**10-5**], motor exam was uncahnged but he was increasingly
lethargic. Sedation was discontinued, and by the evening of [**10-5**]
he was agitated and combative. On morning of [**10-6**] he started to
become more lethargic, and this progressed over the day despite
lack of sedation. He also had worsening hypertension that was
refractory to labetalol, enalaprilat, and metoprolol. he was
started on nipride with increased doses of enalaprilat and
metoprolol with SBP 170s (goal). Due to increased lethargy,
neurology consultant recommended repeat head CT which showed
large right temporo-occipital bleed with extension into right
ambient cistern, 5x4x1.8 cm. CT also showed diffuse edema R>L
and
narrowing of the ambient cistern concerning for early herniation
so pt started on decadron and mannitol. Exam prior to transfer
with no purposeful movement, some movement of bilateral limbs
with deep sternal rub, increased tone on left, equal and
reactive
pupil's with +oculocephalic reflex.

T 97.8  BP 194/108  HR 119
AC FiO2 1.0  650x16  PEEP 5  O2 sat 99%
General: Appears stated age, intubated
HEENT: NC/AT Sclera anicteric
Neck: Supple. R CEA incision c/d/i, stapled
Lungs: Clear to auscultation anterolaterally
CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no murmur.
Abd: Soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
Extr: No edema, good dorsalis pedis pulses

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status: Awake, agitated, bucking vent, vigorously moving
right arm and leg, responding to noxious stimulus of a-line
placement. Does not follow commands. No obvious neglect

Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to
3 mm bilaterally, brisk. Does turn head to both sides, unable to
assess VOR as pt too awake but does not look right or left to
command. Corneal reflexes normal bilaterally. No upper face
droop
with grimace to noxious, difficult to assess lower face given
intubation.

Motor: Normal bulk. Decreased tone left arm and leg. No
fasiculations. No tremor. Vigorously moves right arm and leg to
noxious/spontaneously with full strength. Some flexion of left
arm in response to arterial stick but otherwise minimal, no
spontaneous movement left leg.

Sensation: Withdraws right arm/leg. Minimal, near absent
posturing of left leg and arm to noxious.

Reflexes: DTRs brisker left vs right. Toes were up on right,
mute
on left.

Unable to assess coordination and gait given mental status.

Studies:
Head MRI:
Evolving right parietal hematoma with extension into the
adjacent lateral ventricle and basal CSF cisterns, with much
associated vasogenic edema. In this clinical setting,
intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to hyperperfusion post
carotid endarterectomy remains a distinct possibility.
Hemorrhage into a pre-existing vascular malformation is
possible. Other etiologies, such as hemorrhage secondary to
amyloid angiopathy, overcoagulation, or pre-existing tumor,
either primary or secondary, are thought to be less likely.
Followup MRA or CTA will provide further information, to exclude
underlying vascular malformation.
----
Head CT:Large area of parietal occipital intraparenchymal
hemorrhage which extends into the ambient cistern and
quadrigeminal plate cistern all the way to the foramen magnum in
the subarachnoid space. No or minimal shift of midline
structures to the left. Normal-sized ventricles without evidence
of hydrocephalus. The pattern of white matter hypodensity is not
characteristic for infarction, and a white matter process,
including a tumor and a multifocal vascular process, should be
considered as a cause for this hemorrhage. An MRI/MRA is
recommended. This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 9:40am
on [**2128-10-7**].
----
CTA:Fetal type posterior communicating arteries bilaterally as
described. No definite evidence of aneurysm.
----
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]:Anterolisthesis with posterior disc bulge at L4-L5
with associated bilateral pars defect. Increased L4-L5 disc
T2-signal, which may reflect spinal degeneration, although
possible infection cannot be excluded. Recommend clinical
correlation and followup radiographs to monitor for interval
change.
