Lungs: decreased BS in RLL posteriorly with dullness to
percussion
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS
Extremities: no edema, 2+ DP/PT pulses
Neuro: Pt awake but unable to follow commands


Pertinent Results:
CT Chest on [**2159-2-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Despite new small caliber right apical pleural drain, large
right
hydropneumothorax persists, with interval increase in air
component and large layering fluid component containing clot.
2.  Asbestos-related pleural plaques. No pleural mass.
3.  Right middle and lower lobe collapse and upper lobe
segmental atelectasis due to combination of retained secretions
and compression by effusion. Bronchoscopy should be helpful to
evaluate and clear the endobronchial components.
4.  Decreasing small left pleural effusion.
5.  Stable, fusiform 4.8cm dilatation, ascending thoracic aorta.


CT Chest on [**2159-1-6**]:
IMPRESSION:  Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left, with extensive continuous pleural plaque
calcification due to asbestos exposure.  Differentiation between
mass (mesotelioma , lung ca. ) , and collapsed lung is difficult
without IV We cannot exclude a mass in the right lower lobe.
Depending on the results of pleural effusion cytology,
contrast-enhanced CT is recommended.
Dilatation of the ascending aorta.
Extensive coronary calcifications.
Extensive calcification of the aortic valve.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109257**] is a 71yo male with PMH as listed above who presents
with FTT and was found to have a large R sided pleural effusion
on cxray.
.
#)R pleural effusion: Patient found to have large R sided
pleural effusion on cxray. In context of recent weight loss and
lethargy concerned about underlying malignancy. He has a past
history of smoking cigars but currently has no tobacco use. Pt
now s/p thoracentesis. Afebrile and has no leukocytosis.
Cytology from thoracentesis and pleural biopsies were negative,
although gross findings concerning for malignancy. Chest tube
and pleurex catheters were placed. Chest tube has been pulled
after drainage plateaued and pleural catheter still in place to
drain fluid as needed.  Fluid studies from [**2-1**] show gram +
cocci in clusters, cell count with diff is pending. Pleural
fluid hematocrit is 16 and also high counts concerning for
empyema.  Patient subsequently became hypotensive and was
transferred to MICU service for further management of
empyema/hypotension.  Chest-tube was placed.  Patient eventually
succumbed to complications from empyema and expired.
.
#)Anemia: Baseline Hct in low 30's. Hct on admission~35 and
dropped to 31, 28, and then 22, received 2 units PRBC and bumped
to 29. Had recurrent hemothorax that eventually led to patient
becoming hypotensive and transferred to the ICU.
.
#)Weight loss: Per OMR and fellow's note patient has had
significant weight loss over the past several months. Per OMR,
when he saw his geriatrician in [**11-22**] he had lost ~20lbs at that
time. Likely underlying malignancy given new pleural effusion.
[**Name (NI) **] sister who is healthcare proxy has refused PEG tube
placement in the past.  Started low-dose megestrol for appetite
stimulation, as patient's sister has specifically requested
this.  Liver enzymes elevated, particularly alkaline phos,
source unclear. Could be due to biliary stasis due to decreased
PO intake, as GGT also elevated. Nutrition supplements with
Ensure.  Nutrition consulted.  Malignancy workup as above.
.
#)Lethargy: Patient initially extremely tired and not responsive
to commands. Likely related to large R sided pleural effusion.
Has improved somewhat after thoracentesis. He has also had
significant weight loss with poor PO intake over the past few
weeks.  TSH WNL.  Anemia work-up as below
.
#)Frontal lobe dementia: Continue home regimen of memantine.
.
#)CAD: s/p CABG. Patient denies chest pain on this admission.
Patient had troponin leak after hypotensive episode. Continue
ASA, beta blocker
.
#) History of CVA: Ct ASA 325mg PO daily
.
#)Hypertension: Patient does not appear to be on any medications
at home although history of HTN documented in OMR. He was
started on beta-blocker in ED.  Continue Metoprolol 12.5mg PO
BID  with hold parameters.
.
#)Type 2 DM: Patient on Metformin at home. Per OMR, BSs~120's.
Given poor PO intake concerned that his BSs may drop.  Held oral
regimen; restarted at time of discharge
.
