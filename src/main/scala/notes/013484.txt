Admission Date:  [**2103-1-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2103-2-1**]


Service:  A-COVE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxic respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Hospital 96852**] nursing
home resident who presents with several days of fatigue,
malaise, no pep, and worsening shortness of breath.  She
notes several days of cough with yellowish sputum, dyspnea on
exertion, and now it has progressed dyspnea at rest.  She
denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain or
orthopnea.  At baseline the patient is very active and able
to walk half a block without needing to stop or rest.

The patient was given Lasix in the Emergency Department with
improvement in her saturations and her FIO2 requirement.  She
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further
medical care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Cardiomyopathy.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
9.  Left hip fracture in [**2101**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Ambien, aspirin, Lasix 60 mg
p.o. q.d., Combivent, albuterol, levothyroxine 0.075,
Zestril 75 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed temperature of 97.1, pulse of 90 to 110
(sinus), blood pressure 88/50, respiratory rate of 20 to 30,
and oxygen saturation greater than 93%.  Alert and oriented
times three.  Spoke in full sentences, anicteric.  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Chest with rhonchi
and diffuse wheezes, severe kyphosis.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities without
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Notable
laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count
of 17.8, hematocrit of 31, platelets of 270.  Chem-7 revealed
a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.5, chloride of 99,
bicarbonate of 31, blood urea nitrogen of 17, creatinine
of 0.5, blood sugar of 125.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray with right multifocal
opacities and question of pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   PULMONARY:  Pneumonia; multilobar
infiltrate consistent with Staphylococcus, and vancomycin and
levofloxacin were initiated.

Over the course of the next few days, the patient's FIO2
needs decreased.  The patient was do not resuscitate/do not
intubate and was not intubated.  She was transferred to the
A-Cove Service on [**2103-1-30**] with oxygen saturations of
93% on 5 liters nasal cannula.  Meter-dosed inhalers and
nebulizers were initiated for presumed chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation; although steroids were not
begun given her likely pneumonia.

Arterial blood gas on [**1-28**] was 7.44/52/61.  Lasix was
initiated p.r.n. for decreased oxygen saturations, but none
was given standing given the patient's history of
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with congestive heart
failure.

On the floor, the patient continued to have episodes of acute
respiratory distress while eating and resolving spontaneously
with coughing, suggestive of mucous plugging.  The patient
was made n.p.o. and Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage
of her pneumonia.  Steroids were started as the patient
continued to have diffuse wheezing on examination.

However, in the morning of [**2-1**], the patient continued to
have significant respiratory distress, was diaphoretic,
tachycardic to the 110s and 120s, and initially responsive by
mental status began to wane rapidly.  Arterial blood gas was
7.03/129/99/37 on 100% face mask.  Electrocardiogram was
tachycardic with no significant acute ST-T wave changes, and
the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit again
for BiPAP initiation.

Soon after transfer to the Intensive Care Unit the [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy (Mr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29079**]) was notified of her
situation and felt that the patient should continue to be do
not resuscitate/do not intubate.  A 40% Venti-mask was
placed, and the patient was given morphine for comfort.  Soon
afterwards, at 1320 on [**2-1**], the patient expired.  An
autopsy was refused.
