Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from outside hospital for carotid stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Carotid angiography
Carotid stenting
Electrophysiology study
Biventricular pacemaker and ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 84 year-old male with a history of dilated
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15%, LBBB, and GI bleed who
presented to [**Hospital3 10377**] on [**2153-7-1**] with syncope.  He
states that he was in his usual state of health at the
drive-through for Honey Dew Donut when he fainted and hit a
wall.  The event was not preceded by any symptoms including CP,
SOB, dizziness, nausea, or diaphoresis.  He was initially going
to be referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a biventricular ICD but an MRA of
the carotids showed 55-60% stenosis in the left internal
carotid.  However, carotid ultrasound showed high velocities in
the left internal carotid suggestive of an 80-95% stenosis.

Pt states that he had only fainted once before, about 1.5 years
ago, when he was found to be in CHF.  He reports some increased
DOE over the past few months, becoming more SOB after walking up
1.5 flight of stairs.  He also denies chest pain, palpitations,
orthopnea, or PND.  He denies any headaches, lightheadedness or
vertigo, vision changes, difficulty speaking, or weakness.

Past Medical History:
systolic congestive heart failure with LVEF of 15%
Gastrointestinal bleed
Hiatal hernia
GERD

Social History:
Social history is significant for 70 pack-year history of
tobacco use; patient stopped smoking 1.5 years ago when
diagnosed with congestive heart failure.  Pt used to have 1
alcoholic drink every 1-2 days but has also stopped.  There is
no history of illicit drug use. Pt used to do dry wall & plaster
but is retired.  He lives with wife (recovering from recent
admission for sciatica), is able to perform activities of daily
living.


Family History:
He had two sons, but both passed away.  One had lymphoma, other
unknown.  There is no family history of premature coronary
artery disease or sudden death.

Studies-
.

.
TELEMETRY at OSH in [**6-17**]: No significant pauses, no VT.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM at OSH in [**2152**]: Severe global hypokinesis with
EF of 15%.  Mild MR and Mild TR.

CAROTID DUPLEX at OSH on [**2153-7-3**]:
1. Severe heterogeneous calcified plaque in both carotid
systems, right greater than left
2. Flow velocities throughout the right ICA and common carotid
suggests an occlusion
3. Flow velocities within the left ICA suggest a high grade
80-95% stenosis.
4. Vertebral flow is antegrade bilaterally

MRA at OSH on [**2153-7-3**]: Examination degraded by patient motion.
Occlusion of the right carotid arterial system with
reconstitution primarily via the ophthalmic and right A1
segments.

MRI BRAIN at OSH on [**2153-7-3**]:
Examination degraded by patient motion.  Diffuse cerebral
atrophy and scattered small old supra and infratentorial
infarcts.  Focal encephalomalacia of the right frontoparietal
region probably represents an old watershed infarct.
.
EKG ([**2153-7-9**]):
Sinus bradycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch
block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-7-9**] no diagnostic
interim change.
TRACING #2
.
EKG [**2153-7-10**]: rate of 54bpm
Sinus bradycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch
block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-7-10**] sinus rhythm has
appeared.
.
Carotid Cath [**2153-7-9**]
COMMENTS:
1. Access: Retro RFA with catheter selective to LCCA.
2. Thoracic aorta: Type II arch with noted occlusion of RCCA.
3. Carotid/Vertebrals: The RCCA is occluded. The right vertebral
is
patent. The LCCA has mild orign disease without noted
significant
gradient. The ipsilateral CCA fills the ECA and ICA with the ICA
filling
the ipsilateral ACA and MCA with robust cross filling from a
patent ACOM
to the contralateral territories (right ACA and MCA).
4. Successful PTA/stent to left ICA with a [**6-17**] x40mm Acculink
stent
posted with a 4.0mm balloon. Excellent result with normal flow
down
vessel and 20% residual. Patient remained neurologically intact.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. 70% stenosis of left ICA.
2. Occluded right ICA.
3. Successful PTA/stent to left ICA with a 6-8x40mm
self-expanding stent
and posted with a 4.5mm balloon.
.
CXR [**2153-7-11**]
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The pacemaker/AICD is seen overlying
the left chest wall, with one lead residing in the right atrium
and two overlying the expected location of the right ventricle.
The heart size is top normal. The pulmonary vasculature is
normal. Mild pleural thickening is seen, particularly along the
right lateral chest wall. There is no focal
consolidation or pneumothorax.
.
 CXR [**2153-7-12**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-11**], there is no
interval change.  The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper
limits of normal in size. There is no change in the appearance
of the pacemaker lead. No acute pneumonia.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Carotid stenosis:
Pt gently hydrated with normal saline and then given bicarb
prior to carotid angiography, also given Mucomyst for renal
protection.  Behavioral Neurology evaluated patient, reported no
focal neurological findings before or after the procedure.
During the procedure patient had stenting of Left internal
carotid artery. Pt tolerated the procedure well and was observed
overnight in the CCU. Pt is now on plavix and aspirin.
.
# Syncope possibly secondary to dysrhythmia
Due to bradycardia and a recent syncopal episode, the patient
had an electophysiology study on [**2153-7-10**]. As a result it was
thought that the pt would benefit from Biventricular Implantable
Cardioverter and Defibrillator (BiICD) placement to prevent
bradycardia and future syncope. Pt had a known history of LBBB,
and atrial fibrillation, and while in the hospital he has had
sinus bradycardia into the 30's, rare PVCs and PACs. In the EP
lab atrial fibrillation was induced, the patient had
unsuccessful conversion with ibutelide, and later the patient
had 5 seconds of tachycardia to 120's. On [**2153-7-11**], patient had a
[**Company 1543**] BiV/ICD via cephalic and axillary, and before the
procedure had converted spontaneously into sinus rhythm. The
pacemaker's inferior lead briefly intermittently simulated the
phrenic nerve, but it was adjusted to resolve this issue. Pt had
a small hematoma in the area of the procedure, a pre
