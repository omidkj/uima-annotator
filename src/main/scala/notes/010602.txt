Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotrachial intubation on [**2160-12-20**]


History of Present Illness:
44 yo man with PMH significant for depression, paranoid
psychosis, diabetes, and possibly previous hyponatremia,
initially admitted to ED for trauma s/p fall found to be
hyponatremic with Na 103. Per the patient's wife, he had been
feeling "unwell" for the past few days with "flu-like" symptoms.
On further questioning, she reports some of this is his anxiety
attacks, and possibly his paranoid delusions. In addition,
however, he was having full body diaphoresis, like being hosed
down with water. On the day of admission, he went to work and
was witnessed to fall/collapse from a standing position. He was
intubated in the field. No evidence of seizure activity.
The patient was given hypertonic saline in the ED for correction
of hyponatremia. He also received a tetanus shot. His facial
lacerations were sutured.
Per his wife, the patient had not started any new medications
recently. He does drink a lot of seltzer, approximately a 2L
bottle a day, but this has been true for years. She denied him
having any cough, shortness of breath, weakness, facial
weakness, headache, photophobia, or fever. He had an episode of
similar diaphoresis approximately two years ago, which was
different in that he did not lose consciousness, and was
apparently extensively worked up at [**Hospital3 13313**]. Per
his wife, he was never given a particular etiology except
possibly medications and possibly polydipsia.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-12-21**] 6:42 AM
CHEST: A portable supine AP view at 6:15 a.m. is compared to
previous exam a day ago. Since the previous exam, there is new
right upper lobe collapse. The remainder of the lungs is clear.
The positions of the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are
unchanged and they are in satisfactory position.
.
CT head: Equivocal blurring versus artifact in the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter
junction in the temporal lobes. A follow-up study is suggested.
.
CT C-spine: No evidence of fracture or dislocation. Scarring at
the lung apices, particularly the left.
.
CT sinus/mandible/maxillofacial: : No evidence of fracture or
postseptal injury.
.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2160-12-24**] 3:41 PM
CONCLUSION: The brain appears normal. There are paranasal sinus
and mastoid inflammatory changes, and scalp swelling or a scalp
hematoma.
.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2160-12-23**] 2:41 PM
CONCLUSION:
1. Slightly technically limited examination, but there is no
intra-abdominal malignancy seen.
2. Extensive bilateral chest consolidation in this intubated
patient with some nonspecific ground glass opacities identified.
Appearances are unchanged from previous day's chest CT.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-12-25**] 6:38 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-21**], 10th, and 11th.
Mild pulmonary edema and mediastinal vascular engorgement have
improved substantially. Although both could be reflection of
increased positive pressure ventilatory support, the findings
may also represent clearing of cardiac decompensation. The areas
is previously ascribed to pneumonia are also improving,
particularly in the right upper lobe indicating pneumonia was
not as extensive as previously feared.
Heart size is normal and there is no pleural effusion or
indication of pneumothorax.
ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube is looped
several times in the stomach. No central venous catheter is
seen.
