None

History of Present Illness:
54 yo F with h/o HIV on HAART (CD4=437 [**8-3**]), DM2 (diet
controlled), CKD, R-sided CHF w/severe pulm HTN, with two recent
admissions to [**Hospital1 112**] for hypersensitivity reaction c/b
polymicrobial bacteremia (including VRE/MRSA), iatrogenic
[**Location (un) 3484**], recent C. diff colitis s/p recent hospitalization at
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**9-10**] to [**10-10**] for fluid overload (treated with lasix
gtt and metolazone), MRSA septicemia (requiring MICU stay, IVF,
CVL, and treated with IV vancomycin), skin breakdown (bactroban
cream TID), and hyponatremia.  The patient was discharged to
rehab off of diuretics, which were stopped as it was felt she
was intravascularly volume depleted. The patient had just
finished her course of PO vancomycin for C. diff on Friday (two
days before admission).

Earlier today, the patient was found to be acting out and
yelling in pain at her nursing facility. On the ambulance ride
to [**Hospital1 **], the patient's blood glucose was found to be
"low." At [**Hospital1 **], CXR negative. The patient was given
1 amp of D50 and 500mL [**Hospital1 1868**] of saline, after which she stopped
complaining of discomfort. The patient was requiring increasing
oxygen, but otherwise her vital signs were stable. Her blood
pressures were never below 110 systolic, and pulse was generally
in 60s-70s. The patient was hypothermic to 95.8 there. After
discussion with her son [**Name (NI) 2855**], it was decided to bring her to
[**Hospital1 **], where she has received most of her care.
Here she was also found to have a wide-complex, sinusoidal EKG.
Due to concern for hyperkalemia (hemolyzed blood sample),
patient was given 6g calcium gluconate, nebulizer, 10 units of
insulin and an amp of bicarb. She did not receive kayexelate.
She was found to have hypothermia here as well and placed in a
Beir Hugger. She was breathing rapidly and deeply and appeared
to have increasing oxygenation requirement. The patient was
eventually transferred to the ICU on CPAP 10/5 with 50% FiO2.

On my interview, the patient reported that she was much more
comfortable with the CPAP. She confirmed the history above and
reported that she continued to have pain, especially in her
shoulders and legs. When specifically asked, she also endorsed
chest pain.

Past Medical History:
- HIV, diagnosed in [**2158**], on HAART (CD4=437 [**8-3**]),
-Patient recently presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**7-11**] with severe
desquamating rash and transferred to [**Hospital1 112**] burn unit. Rash was
determined to desquamating lichenoid hypersensitivity reaction
which was treated by stopping ART, avoidance of cephalosporins
and drugs of abuse such as cocaine. Dermatology was consulted on
admission and recommended wrapping patient in saran wrap and
using Vaseline for skin care. No mucosal involvement was noted
on admission. She was given copious IVF, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Hugger was
utilized given insensible losses and impaired thermoregulation.
Dermatology re-evaluation on [**2183-8-11**] revealed worsening mucosal
involvement and new erythroderma. This raised concern for
progression of her severe drug hypersensitivity eruption. This
was felt to be secondary to ART, specifically abacavir and
lamuvidine, and potentially ceftriaxone to her recent admission
to [**Hospital1 112**].  She is not currently on any related medications. Of
note, her last attempted ART was on [**7-29**] resulting in
maculo-papular rash. s/p Transfer to [**Hospital1 756**] Burn Unit [**8-11**]

Imaging:
[**2183-10-12**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
significant
change from prior.

[**2183-10-13**] CT abdomen:
1.  New, moderate-to-large volume ascites as compared to
[**2182-8-22**] exam, which appears to be simple.
2.  Increase in heart size compared to prior, consistent with
worsening right heart failure as documented in previous
cardiology notes.  Suspect that the ascites may be related to
the right heart failure.
2.  Cholelithiasis.
3.  Dysmorphic appearance of the right kidney with some capsular

calcifications likely secondary to prior hematoma.
