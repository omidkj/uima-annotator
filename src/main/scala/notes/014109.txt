Brief Hospital Course:
[**2134-12-5**] 84F a/w COPD exacerbation earlier this week to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**].
Initial presenting symptoms were productive cough with worsening
dyspnea. She was admitted to the medical service and started on
antibiotics and steroids. There was some improvement to her
clinical status. However, yesterday afternoon, she complained of
back pain. When examined, it was noted that she had ecchymosis
to
her L flank as this was likely due to her subcutaneous heparin
injections. Her symptoms did not improve and hematoma continue
to
increase in size and involving anterior abdomen. An overnight CT
scan was obtained and showed several pockets of the hematoma
along the abdominal wall in the musculature. The extent is
greater than 20 cm craniocaudal with the largest hematoma
measuring roughly 13 x 7 cm. There is no retroperitoneal or
intraperitoneal extension.

Her Hct on admission was 34 and did drop to 28 during this
episode and with 2u pRBC, Hct (per report) responded at 29.
Blood
pressure and urine output remained marginal and she continued to
have tachycardia. She was transferred to the ICU for further
observation. Hct this AM was 24.6. Decision was then made to
