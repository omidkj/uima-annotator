Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4358**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
69F h/o HTN, hypothyroidism, tracheobronchomalacia s/p surgery
[**1-/2106**], COPD on 4L home O2, OSA on VPAP, prior admission for PNA
with and ICU stay, who p/w 3d of pain in back of head, unsteady
gait, and cough. Pt states that her symptoms began 3-4 days ago
with pain in the back of her head, more significant on the R
side. It starts at the back of the head, near the occiput, and
travels up the scalp to the forehead. This pain is intermittent,
shooting sharp pain that happens every 5-10 min and has been
increasing in frequency. She has tried ibuprofen for the pain
but with no relif. She denies any associated dizziness,
lightheadedness, or blurry vision.

She has also been having a productive cough of thick, yellow
sputum, along with increasing oxygen requirement. She notes that
she has oxygen at home, but usually only uses it in the car (at
4L) but recently has been having to use it during the day as
well. Her wife, who is at her bedside, has noticed that the pt
has had an unsteady gait for the past few days in which the pt
will stumble after walking a few steps and she states she has to
catch the pt to prevent her from falling.

In ED VS were 98.6 86 122/68 16 95% 4L.  Labs significant for
WBC 18.7 with left shift. CXR demonstrated large LUL
consolidation, widening of mediastinum [**3-3**] lymphadenopathy.
Given levaquin 750mg IV x1.  VS on transfer T 102.1, HR 88, BP
115/59, rr 22 - 26, SpO2 95% on 4LO2 NC.

On the floor, T 101.7, BP 124/60. She appeared comfortable and
was accompanied by her wife who was at her bedside. Her wife
noted that she felt she had an upper respiratory tract infection
about 4-5 days prior. She was experiencing the shooting pains at
the back of her head during the interview, but she stated it
didn't prevent her from doing her daily activities. She endorsed
an intentional 70lb weight loss in the past 16 mos.

IMAGING
[**2106-11-25**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. Left atrial enlargement.
Incomplete right bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2105-12-17**] ventricular bigeminy no longer exists.

[**2106-11-25**] CHEST (PA & LAT): There is widening of the mediastinum,
particularly the right lower paratracheal region, compatible
with lymphadenopathy, as demonstrated on the recent chest CTs
from [**2106-10-19**] and [**2106-4-5**]. There is a new
consolidative opacity in the left upper lobe compatible with
pneumonia. Lungs are hyperinflated with lucency and relative
attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings in the upper lobes
compatible with underlying emphysema. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is present. There are mild degenerative changes of
the thoracic spine. Right-sided rib deformities are unchanged.

[**2106-11-25**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute
hemorrhage, large acute territorial infarction, or large masses.
There are bilateral subcortical and periventricular white matter
hypodensities in keeping with chronic small vessel ischemic
changes. Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration. Mucosal thickening is seen in all the paranasal
sinuses, most severe in the left frontal and right sphenoid
sinus, with sparing of the right frontal sinus, which is .
Mastoid air cells are well pneumatized.

[**2106-11-26**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Lung volumes are lower today than
yesterday and there is mild vascular congestion but not florid
pulmonary edema. Lower lung volumes exaggerate the size of the
already large area of consolidation in the left upper lobe, but
the overall impression is that it has grown. There is no
appreciable left pleural effusion. Mediastinal fullness suggests
central lymph node enlargement, not surprising in the face of a
large area of pneumonia. Heart size is top normal. No
pneumothorax. Patient has had right chest surgery, entailing
posterior upper rib fractures, which are not completely fused.

[**2106-11-26**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST: There is dense consolidation
with air bronchograms centered predominantly within the lingula
with extension into the apicoposterior segment of the superior
lobe. Scattered additional predominantly peripheral interstitial
abnormalities were present on the prior examination and likely
represent fibrosis. There is severe upper lobe predominant
emphysema. A 3-mm left apical pulmonary nodule is unchanged
(3:7), as is a 4-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule (3:27)
dating back to [**2105-11-17**], establishing one-year stability.
There is mild bilateral dependent atelectasis. There are
coronary artery and aortic calcifications. No pericardial
effusion is seen. A left hilar node measures 2.0 cm in short
axis, a right paratracheal node 1.5 cm in short axis, and a
prevascular node 1.6 cm in short axis, all increased in size
from [**2106-10-27**] CT. Other smaller reactive nodes are noted
throughout the mediastinum.

[**2106-11-28**] CHEST X-RAY:
IMPRESSION: Compared to the film from two days prior, there has
been some interval partial clearing of the dense left-sided
infiltrate, which although still present, has slightly more
aerated lung within it. Right upper rib fractures are again seen
secondary to prior surgery. There continues to be mild vascular
congestion.
