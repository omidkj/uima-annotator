OTHER STUDIES
==============
TTE [**2110-3-5**]:
IMPRESSION: Preserved regional and global left ventricular
function. Mild right ventricular dilatation with mild global
hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.

[**2110-3-4**] ercp:
The ampulla was bulging and fleshy. (biopsy)
The old stent was removed with a snare.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in complete opacification.  A straight tip
.035in guidewire was placed. At least one large, 14 mm, stone
and large amount of sludge were seen in CBD. CBD measured 18 mm.
   A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. Given the
large size of stone, sphincteroplasty was performed with a 12 mm
balloon. A large 14 mm stone and large amount of sludge were
extracted successfully using a 15 mm balloon. At the end of
procedure CBD was free of stone or debris.  Otherwise normal
ercp to third part of the duodenum.

Chest Radiograph [**2110-3-5**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-1**]:
Severe cardiomegaly has worsened and there is mild interstitial
edema, but
most significant change is new moderate right pleural effusion.
Infusion port catheter ends in the right atrium. No
pneumothorax.

CT Abdomen and Pelvis w/o Contrast [**2110-3-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, moderate on the
right and
small on the left.
2. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with a catheter terminating
in the right
atrium.
3. Moderate intra- and extra-hepatic pneumobilia, findings
consistent with
recent ERCP and sphincterotomy.
4. Vascular calcifications with moderate plaque seen at the
origins of the
celiac axis and right renal artery.
5. No free fluid within the peritoneal cavity or retroperitoneum
to suggest
hematoma.
6. Stable small uncomplicated ventral hernia.
7. Unchanged hepatic
