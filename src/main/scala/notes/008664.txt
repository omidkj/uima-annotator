Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB/cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old man with h/o HIV (last CD4 182, VL 56
per report), on HAART, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] ED
with shortness of breath and cough.
.
The patient reports 6-8 weeks of progressively worsening
shortness of breath and productive cough. He was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital6 302**] for hyponatremia and left
from rehab last week (unclear if he left AMA or was discharged
home). He notes that he was short of breath at the OSH, but that
it has gotten worse over the past week. He now gets short of
breath with any movement. He stopped smoking 4 days prior to
admission [**2-10**] to SOB. According to the daughter, the patient has
been ill since [**40**]/[**2138**]. He has had multiple hospitalizations
(frequently leaves AMA), has lost weight, decreased appetite. No
fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria,
headache, sore throat, congestion.
.
Pt received the following meds at the OSH ED: Azithromycin 500mg
IV, Bactrim 250mg IV, Solumedrol 125mg IV, Ceftriaxone 1g IV.
CXR was unchanged from prior CXR last month.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.5 BP 132/78 P 102 RR 18 O2sat
98% 4LNC. BP was noted to drift down to SBP 90s, so the patient
was given 2LNS. CXR showed bilateral patchy interstitial
opacification of the lower lobes. Vitals on transfer: P 92 BP
101/68 RR 18 O2sat 100%4LNC.
.
On the floor, the patient reported feeling improved. Breathing
seemed less strenuous. However, given concern for hypotension,
hypoxia, and possible decompensation overnight, he was
transferred to the MICU for further monitoring.
.
In the MICU, the patient remains comfortable on nasal cannula.
SOB had improved and BP stabilized in the 120s-130s. He was
called out to the medical floor Sunday morning. The patient
continued to remain Hemodynamically stable with improving oxygen
requirements to 3L NC this am. In the hour prior to transfer the
patient had a rapid increase in work of breathing. Although his
saturations held in the low 90s he was increasing tachypneic and
tachycardic. Per nursing he was slightly disoriented, however
eating without signs of aspiration. He was intubated on the
floor with 60mcg of prpofol and 20 of succ.

Given gradual decline in respiratory function (6-8 weeks), this
appears to be a more chronic process that is acutely worsened by
evolving PNA within the LLL and GNR in sputum.  There seems to
be underlying lung obstructive pathology that was not previously
identified(probable COPD).  Pt continued to receive meropenem
for GNR identified on BAL Cx; pt's respiratory status continued
to decline.  Family decided that given severe underlying disease
and poor prognosis in regard to returning to desired quality of
life, pt was to be extubated and placed on CMO with DNI/DNR.  Pt
expired shortly after extubation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old man with h/o HIV on HAART (last CD4
182, VL 56), HTN, who presents with 6-8 week h/o progressively
worsening shortness of breath.
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given gradual decline in
respiratory function (6-8 weeks), this appears to be a more
chronic process that is acutely worsened by evolving PNA within
the LLL and GNR in sputum.  There seems to be underlying lung
obstructive pathology that has not been identified yet (probable
COPD).  Had planned for extubation  but depends on outcome of
family meeting.

- Family states that patient would not desire to be trached; per
family not to be reintubated. Per family, will extubate today
with CMO -> expired shortly after extubation.

- Reiterate with family that extubation is unlikely to be
successful.

- Attempting PSV prior to extubation.

- Sedation: wean sedation; change from drip to bolus of fentanyl

- continue zyprexa 2.5 [**Hospital1 **]

.

# Acidosis:  possible proximal RTA with elevated Cl and
suboptimal increase in bicarb; proximal RTA most likely
secondary to anti retrovirals. Resolving with a  bicarbonate
level approx. 30

- Combivir once a day started instead of tenofavir to avoid RTA

- trend lactate, Cr

- Renal/ID recs.

.

#. HIV: Pt was diagnosed in [**2126**]. Last CD4 182, VL 56, as per
OSH records. Pt reports being adherent with current regimen of
Kaletra and Truvada. However, per daugther the patients mental
status has been deteriorating and med compliance could be an
issue.

- await the result of HLA typing.

- serum toxo serology sent (pending) and started bactrim DS
qday; if negative, change Bactrim every other day

- continue combivir

.

#. Anemia: Pt with macrocytic anemia. Appears at baseline. B12,
folate normal, likely [**2-10**] HIV meds.  HCT continues to trend
down.

- monitor HCT

-transfuse < 21

.

# Cachexia: Likely [**2-10**] AIDs.

- NG tube feeds

-started reglan

.

# COPD: continue INH steroids. Continue MDI

.
# FEN: IVF bolus prn, replete electrolytes, regular di
