female with a history of severe aortic stenosis,
hypertension, coronary artery disease, who presented to
outside hospital emergency [**Hospital1 **] after a mechanical fall.
According to the patient she was walking to the television to
turn it on when she slipped and fell on her left side.  The
patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, and
dizziness.  There was no loss of consciousness.  They
presented to the outside hospital emergency [**Hospital1 **] where
radiographs revealed a comminuted fracture of the distal left
femur extending into the joint surface.  The patient was

patient was admitted for surgical fixation of her fracture.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient reports having had
myocardial infarction and had a normal exercise stress test
at [**Hospital1 **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a year and a half ago.  She never had
cardiac catheterization.  She has been followed by primary
care physician for cardiac problems.  [**Name (NI) **] obtained from
the outside hospital, [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **], echocardiogram was
done on [**2132-1-17**] with an ejection fraction of 30%,
severe aortic stenosis with the aortic valve area of 0.7 cm
squared.  The patient denied a history of hypertension,
diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco use, congestive heart
failure, chest pain or syncopal episodes.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix, Metoprolol, [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel and
Acetaminophen.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone at home and is
independent with all activities of daily living.  She
ambulates one flight of stairs in-house.

Echocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular
hypertrophy, 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V1 to V3, no change
compared to echocardiogram from [**2131-1-16**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation
reveals the patient is a white female in no distress.  Head
atraumatic, normocephalic.  Eyes, extraocular movements
intact.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart
regular rate and rhythm.  Left lower extremity with flexion
deformity.  No ulcerations, no abrasions.  Extensor hallucis
longus, flexor hallucis longus, anterior tibialis [**5-19**], normal
sensation to light touch in L1-S1.  Dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial pulses 2+.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to severity of aortic stenosis, the
patient was transferred to the Medical Service.  The case was
discussed with Anesthesia.  They feel that it was not safe
for the patient to proceed without further workup.  The
patient went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on
[**2132-10-31**] where the patient underwent valvuloplasty of
the aortic valve.  As a result, gradient across the aortic
valve was decreased from 87 to 33 mm of mercury, E to A
increased from baseline of 0.36 cm square to 0.65 square.
After angioplasty the patient had episode of bleeding on
[**2132-11-1**] and had developed a large groin hematoma.
Hematocrit fell down to 21 with blood pressure as low as 56
to 20.  The patient was resuscitated with fluids and started
on Dopamine.  The patient was intubated and transferred to
the Cardiac Care Unit.  Pressures throughout the stay in the
Cardiac Unit the patient has been noted to be arousable and
followed commands on request.  Left EJ line, the patient
received blood transfusions with 5 units of red blood cells
and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma.  Hematocrit, blood
pressure and heartrate stabilized in acceptable range.  The
patient had several episodes of tachycardia and atrial
flutter which normalized with Amiodarone.

On [**2132-11-5**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room where she underwent open reduction and internal fixation
with [**Last Name (un) 101**] plate placement.  She was operated on by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 284**].  She tolerated the procedure well and went back
to the Cardiac Care Unit.  It was noted that the patient had
a lack of cough lead and could not be extubated immediately.
She was started on Dexamethasone to decrease the swelling
prior to orthopedic surgery.  She was extubated on [**2132-11-7**].  It was noted that the patient had a somewhat
slowness of speech.  Neurology consult was requested.  Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] saw the patient and did not believe the patient
had aphasia and the reason for slowed speech was secondary to
coming off of intubation along with Fentanyl therapy.
Neurological examination was entirely nonlocalized.

At the time of this dictation, [**2132-11-7**], the patient
is alert and has no problems talking to her providers and
family.  The patient was mobilized by physical therapy who
notes she is nonweightbearing on the left lower extremity.
The patient has [**Doctor Last Name **] immobilizer block in extension.  The
patient needs prolonged course of rehabilitation.  The
patient was screened by rehabilitation facility and will be
tentatively discharged there on [**2132-11-10**], and
addendum will be dictated.
