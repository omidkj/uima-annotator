Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed globally(LVEF= 45 %). The right ventricle displays
borderline normal free wall function. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
regurgitation is mostly central but has a slight posterior lean.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is AV paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 55-60%. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is in situ.
It appears well seated. There is trace mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral stenosis. The remainder of valvular function
remains unchanged. The thoracic aorta appears intact after
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
