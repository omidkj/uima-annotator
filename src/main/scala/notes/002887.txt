Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, back pain, and tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 76281**] is a pleasant 41 yo gentleman with history of
severe crush injury to the left lower extremity in [**2165**],
followed by a saddle embolus in [**2169**], and subsequent below the
knee amputation, now presenting with shortness of breath and
back pain.  Pt states that following his initial deep vein
thrombosis (DVT), he had another DVT in [**2178**] and was started on
coumadin, however this was discontinued after seeing hematology
in [**2181**] because the clots were thought to be provoked.  He is
now presenting with pleuritic back pain, tachycardia, shortness
of breath for 2 days, drenching night sweats for several days,
consistent with prior pulmonary emboli. Of note,
hypercoagulation workup performed in the past was negative.  He
has recently been driving to [**Location (un) 3844**] for fitting of his
prosthesis and states that he noted that the night sweats began
with his first trip to [**Location (un) 3844**], however the pain and
dyspnea began just yesterday.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.6 115 132/79 20 98%.  EKG showed
sinus tach, V2 with RBBB morphology, CT showed massive PE.
Patient was started on heparin gtt, given morphine and dilaudid
for pain, as well as a dose of ceftriaxone for unclear reasons.
Currently 100% on 4L.  Vitals on 97 24 97% on 4L 121/85.

On the floor, pt is complaining of ongoing R-sided back pain and
shortness of breath.

Past Medical History:
-crush injury to his leg in a workplace injury in [**2165**], followed
by amputation due to severe pain and swelling in [**2169**], also
complicated by multiple stump infections
-Reflex sympathetic dystrophy, s/p sympathemectomy prior to leg
amputation
-PE [**2169**], [**2178**]
-Depression
-recent tx for h. pylori

Social History:
He is single, and currently living with two daughters.  Smokes 1
ppd, no alcohol or drugs. Has 5 children, is divorced.  On
longterm disability, formerly steel worker.

Family History:
Mother with history of DVT/PE. No family history of CAD or
diabetes, to his knowledge.

STUDIES:
[**2184-11-9**] CXR:
Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There has
been interval removal of the previously seen left-sided PICC.
Mildly increased perihilar opacities suggest mild pulmonary
vascular engorgement. Subtle opacity at the medial right lung
base may be due to atelectasis or focal consolidation. Dedicate
PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the
main pulmonary appearing enlarged, which may be due to pulmonary
hypertension. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

[**2184-11-9**] CTA chest:
1. Extensive pulmonary emboli affecting the distal right and
left main pulmonary arteries and all lobes with evidence of
right heart strain. Main pulmonary artery is also enlarged.
Recommend echocardiogram for further evaluation.
2. Right lower lobe pulmonary infarct. Small right pleural
effusion with overlying atelectasis; however, additional infarct
in this region cannot be excluded.
3. 7-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. Recommend
three-month
followup with chest CT if no history of malignancy, otherwise
PET-CT.

[**2184-11-9**] LENIs: No evidence of DVT.

[**2184-11-10**] TTE: The left atrium is dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with mild global
hypokinesis and evidence of right ventricular pressure/volume
overload. Pulmonary artery pressure is moderately elevated.
Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 76281**] is a pleasant 41 yo gentleman, with history of
DVTs/PE, who was admitted for SOB, back pain, found to have
massive pulmonary embolus.

# Pulmonary embolus: Patient with history of PEs in the past,
now off coumadin since [**2181**]. Prior hypercoaguability work-up
negative. Admitted to MICU with massive pulmonary embolus on
admission CT. He was initially started on heparin gtt given clot
burden, but decision was made not to perform lysis with TPA. He
was transitioned to Lovenox while being bridged to Coumadin, as
there was no indication for thrombolysis or other procedures. He
began therapy with Coumadin on [**2184-11-10**] with 5mg daily and INR
upon discharge on [**11-12**] was 1.3. Since his last three
measurements of INR was 1.3 on 5mg of Coumadin daily, his dosage
was increased to 7.5mg daily upon discharge, along with lovenox
injections. LENIs showed no DVT. ECHO showed severe right heart
strain. He will have follow-up in [**Month (only) 956**] for repeat ECHO,
unless a sooner appointment becomes available.

# Chest Pain: Location is in the right mid-axillary line just
under the axilla that is pleuritic and musculoskeletal in
nature. Likely related to infarction of lung secondary to
massive PE. Pain controlled with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, and
Oxycodone, with Morphine IV for br
