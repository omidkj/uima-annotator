History of Present Illness:
71 year old male with h/o known C3-4 spinal stenosis with
cervical radiculopathy, HTN, DMII, AFIB on coumadin, s/p left
knee replacement who initially presented to the ED with about
[**2-17**] day history of mid back and right shoulder pain and
difficulty ambluating.
.
The patient is not a very good historian. His wife is a poor
historian as well. Per his wife, the patient had not been able
to ambulate over the last 2-3 days because of pain. His wife had
been giving him Oxycodone over the last few days for pain. His
wife also notes [**2-17**] week history of progressive LE edema and
increasing abdominal girth. The patient had a fever of 103 at
home. He reports b/l hand tingling. He denies dysuria,
frequency, bladder or bowel incontinence, cough, SOB, CP,
palpatations. He denies a h/o trauma. He walks with a cane or
walker at baseline. He reports [**2-17**] day history of constipation.
No vision changes. No photophobia.
.
Of note, he is scheduled for a cervical laminectomy with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2180-12-13**]. He receives his care at [**Hospital 882**] hospital.
.
ED course: Vitals T 100.3, BP 140/68, RR 16, Sat 95% on 2L. The

for presumed PNA.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO Study Date of [**2180-11-22**]
1. The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2180-11-18**]
Discitis and osteomyelitis at L1-2 level with epidural abscess
at L2 level, unchanged from the previous MRI study. Enhancement
of the epidural soft tissues in the lower thoracic and upper
lumbar region is unchanged. No new abnormalities are identified
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W &W/O CONTRAST  [**2180-11-18**]
No evidence of epidural abscess, discitis or osteomyelitis in
the thoracic region. Multilevel degenerative changes. Evaluation
of paraspinal soft tissues and thoracic region is limited, as
the axial images were not obtained
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W& W/O CONTRAST  [**2180-11-16**]
Probable progression of epidural abscess at L2. Increased
enhancement of the intervertebral disc and the adjacent
vertebral bodies at L1-2. Epidural enhancing tissue extending
superiorly from the L1-2 level to T9.
A repeat examination is recommended to evaluate paraspinal soft
tissue swelling in the lower thoracic spine. No evidence of
osteomyelitis, discitis, or epidural abscess in the cervical
spine. However, the evaluation of this level is quite limited.
.
BONE SCAN  [**2180-11-15**]
Reason: PT WITH C3-4 SPINAL STENOSIS, ? OSTEOMYELITIS
1) Increased uptake at the left knee prosthesis on all three
phases,
suggestive of osteomyelitis or septic joint. 2) Intense uptake
in upper lumbar spine, correlating with site of suspected L1/2
discitis by prior MRI. 3)Increased bone uptake on the right at
approximately T11 may be degenerative. Consider anatomic imaging
if there is clinical suspicion of infection at this site. 4)
Increased uptake in the upper cervical spine and peripheral
joints, most likely degenerative.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2180-11-11**]
IMPRESSION: No free air. No dilated bowel loops. Findings
suggestive of right lower lobe pneumonia
.
CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST  [**2180-11-11**]
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
right lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis.
2. Mild left lower lobe compressive atelectasis.
3. Cardiomegaly with a small pericardial effusion.
4. Tiny punctate focus of gas noted within the biliary system,
which may be related to prior sphincterotomy
.
XR L knee [**2180-11-9**]: Large left knee effusion and prepatellar
soft tissue swelling.
.
CT lumbar spine [**2180-11-8**]: 1. Evaluation for epidural abscess is
very limited on this examination and was much better assessed on
the MRI from the same day. No definite epidural abscess can be
seen on this CT examination. No areas of abnormal enhancement
are noted within the paraspinal tissues. 2. Narrowing of the
L1-2 intervertebral disc space with irregularly marginated,
sclerotic endplates of the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies consistent
with discitis, which was previously seen on the MR from the same
day. 3. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above with
mild grade I L4 on L5 retrolisthesis.
.
MRI lumbar spine [**2180-11-8**]: 1. Limited study secondary to patient
motion.
2. Findings are worrisome for L1/2 discitis, and probable
epidural abscess posterior to L2 vertebral body as described
above. There is mild spinal stenosis at this level. 3.
Arachnoiditis 4. Severe degenerative spinal stenosis at L3/4. 5.
Mild retrolisthesis of L4 upon L5 with moderate degenerative
spinal stenosis at this level.
.
LENI [**2180-11-8**]: no evidence of DVT
.
Echo [**2180-11-7**]: LVEF 50%, 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Septal hypokinesis is
present. 3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 4.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
.
CT abd [**2180-11-7**]: Bilateral low attenuation non-enhancing
densities in the perirenal space, likely representing
hemorrhage. Inflammatory stranding from pyelonephritis or stone
passage seems less likely.
.
CXR [**2180-11-6**]: 1. Bilateral small pleural effusions. Left basal
atelectasis.
2. Left superior mediastinal widening due to enlargement of the
left lobe of the thyroid
