History of Present Illness:
72F with history of CAD, DM2, tobacco abuse, who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] c/o malaise, SOB and cough x 3 weeks. She
reports baseline SOB with exertion, which has not significantly
worsened over the past several weeks. Denies CP and dizziness
but does report an epigastric "empty feeling," which she has
experienced intermittently at rest over the past several weeks,
which lasts minutes and is not associated with eating. In
addition, she describes baseline SOB with exertion that has been
unchanged for the past 4 months, but denies significant
orthopnea or PND. She does have peripheral edema in ankles at
baseline, which has not worsened recently. She has had a cough
productive of yellow sputum over the past 3 weeks, but denies
hemoptysis, fever, chills, night sweats and sick contacts. In
the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she was found to have elevated cardiac biomarkers
(troponin I of 4.8) and elevated BNP (1900), with ECG showing
inferolateral TWI. Treated with heparin, clopidogrel, aspirin,
statin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

Conclusions
Prebypass
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**2180-2-18**] at 900am

Post bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine,
milrinone and norepinephrine. RV systolic function is slightly
improved. LVEF is unchanged. Aorta is intact post decannulation.

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
