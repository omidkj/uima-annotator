showed significant free air. Notably, the patient was taking
significant amounts of naproxen prior to her hip surgery
secondary to pain and did receive a few doses of celebrex
postoperatively.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F was admitted and taken to the operating room for repair of a
cecal perforation with right colectomy and ileocecal
anastomosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the ICU postoperatively, where she remained intubated
and required pressors to maintain her blood pressure.

Neuro: she was initially on versed/fentayl for sedation while
intubated, and these were weaned from drips to intermittent, and
finally discontinued upon extubation on POD7.  She received
intermittent morphine for pain control and at present just takes
tylenol for pain as necessary.

CV: she was on neosynephrine in the initial postoperative period
to maintain her blood pressures, but all pressors were weaned by
POD#1 and she received albumin and fluid boluses for blood
pressure support.  She did not require pressors through the
remainder of her stay.  She was started on diltiazem for
management of sinus tachycardia, which she continued to receive
throughout the remainder of her stay. She did have a high BP
with systolic of 200s which was controlled with prn hydralazine.
We started her on torsemide 20 once daily todat at the time of
discharge.

Resp: she remained intubated postoperatively, and failed a
spontaneous breathing trial on POD2.  CXR showed volume
overload, and she was subsequently diuresed with lasix in order
to return to her baseline volume status.  She was briefly on a
lasix drip on POD [**1-31**], and eventually transitioned to her home
lasix dose of 20mg.  After a successful spontaneous breathing
trial, she was extubated on POD7, and tolerated this well.  She
was initially on 4L of oxygen, and this was gradually weaned
throughout the remainder of her stay as she continued to diurese
back to her baseline weight.

GI/FEN: she was made NPO postoperatively with an NGT in place,
and had a postoperative ileus with no bowel function for several
days.  She was started on tube feeds on POD5 and advanced to
goal.  TFs were held on POD8 due to high residuals, and she was
started on TPN on POD11 in order to give her nutrition while not
tolerating enteral feeding.  However, her distention improved
and on POD13 she was restarted on her TFs.  After a successful
clamping trial, she also passed a speech and swallow eval and
was started on a soft solid diet on POD13.  Her NGT was
discontinued.
On POD8, she did have a CT scan due to a rising WBC count, which
showed a R perihepatic collection.  This was drained with IR,
50cc serosanguinous fluid removed.  On [**2177-8-22**], she again had a
repeat CT abdomen for surveillance, which showed an abdominal
fluid collection with was drained in IR. She is on a regular;
mechanical soft Supplement: Ensure breakfast, lunch, dinner

ID: she was placed on empiric vancomycin and zosyn
postoperatively due to her cecal perforation.  She continued on
this regimen, with micafungin added on POD5 due to blood
cultures positive for fungus (C. tropicalis).  She continued on
vancomycin/zosyn/micafungin, and the vancomycin was d/c'ed on
POD13. ID recommends continuing antibiotics atleast 7 days post
drainage which will be [**6-28**]

Heme:  she was transfused 1U prbc's on POD1 for a Hct 25, which
improved appropriately after transfusion.  She did not require
any additional blood during the remainder of her hospital stay,
as her hematocrits were stable with no evidence of bleeding.
