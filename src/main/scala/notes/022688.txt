[**2190-10-5**] UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Left sided dual-chamber
pacemaker leads terminating in the right atrium and right
ventricle is in unchanged position.  There is mild to moderate
cardiomegaly which is stable. Aortic knob calcifications are
redemonstrated. Pulmonary vascularity does not appear markedly
engorged. There are bibasilar airspace opacifications, slightly
worse in the interval, which could represent atelectasis, but
infection is not excluded. Trace bilateral pleural effusions
persist. No pneumothorax. No acute osseous findings are
otherwise demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Worsening bibasilar airspace opacities with small
bilateral
pleural effusions, which may be secondary to atelectasis, but
infection is not excluded.
.
[**2190-10-5**] EKG: Probable "fine" atrial fibrillation. Diffuse ST-T
wave abnormalities are non-specific. Since the previous tracing
of [**2190-7-5**] ST-T wave changes are less prominent.
.
CXR ([**2190-10-19**]): Pulmonary edema with stable left pleural
effusion and decreased right pleural effusion. Right perihilar
atelectasis stable in size with increased density.
.
CXR ([**2190-10-21**]): 1. Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than
right, stable since [**2190-10-12**].
2. Pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
80F NH resident with L MCA CVA, CAD, AFib on coumadin, and
recent hospitalization for LGIB with admitted with fever,
hypoxemia, and report of melena.
.
1. Comfort measures only:  After extensive discussion with
family, decision was made to make her as comfortable as possibe.
 She appears comfortable and clinically seems to be improving.
On morphine concentrated solution 1-5mg po Q2prn respiratory
discomfort. Also on hysocyamine, xopenex/ipratroprium nebs prn.
.
2. Fever and hypoxia - Initial differential included aspiration
pneumonitis, HCAP, ateletasis, or pulm edema.  With fever,
leukocytosis, and bandemia, she was empirically started for HCAP
with vanc/levo/cefepime. Blood and urine culture were negative
with no pneumonia on CXR.  She was continued on levofloxacin
while vancomycin and cefepime were discontinued.  She continued
to be afebrile.  Levofloxacin was discontinued on [**10-8**].  She
was noted to have low grade temperature of 100.4 and
leucocytosis on [**10-11**] with normal hemodynamics. Blood and urine
cultures were negative with unchanged CXR.  Stool studies were
negative as well.  Levofloxacin was restarted with improvement
in her leucocystosis.  She continued to be afebrile.
Levofloxacin was discontinued on [**2190-10-19**].
.
3. Melena/Diarrhea - Recent hospitilization for lower GI Bleed.
Likely from her ischemic colitis.  Continued on pantoprazole 40
mg once a day.  Stool brown guaiac positive on admission.  Her
hematocrit had been stable throughout her hospital stay.  She
was given one unit of PRBCs for drop in her hematocrit to 22.1
from baseline of 25.2 on [**10-14**].  Rectal tube was continued.
Iron was continued as well during her hospital stay.  She
continued to have diarrhea/melena > 800 cc a day from rectal
tube.  Clostridium difficile toxin x 3 were negative.  Stool
studies x 2 were negative.  CMV viral load negative. TTG-IgA for
celiac disease was negative.  Loperamide 2 mg po QID was started
which seemed to have decreased her stool output.  Rectal tube
was discontinued.  Chromogranin A level was elevated which
Gastroenterology agreed did not require workup as she is
currently comfort measures only.
.
4. LLQ pain: Likely from her ischemic colitis.  Has been same
for past few months.  No change in intensity or characteristics
per her.
.
5. AFib- Rate well controlled with metoprol 12.5 mg po TID and
diltiazem 60 mg po QID.  CHADS2 score of 5. Anticoagulated with
Lovenox during her hospital stay.  Her metoprolol and diltiazem
were discontinued once she was made comfort measures only.
.
6. CAD: Was not on aspirin on admission with concern for LGIB.
Continued on simvastatin during the hospital which was
eventually discontinued for the same reason aspirin not started
after weighing in the mortality ben
