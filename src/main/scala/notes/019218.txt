Chief Complaint:
left weakness

History of Present Illness:
HPI:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4643**] is a 73 year old Right handed man with history of
DM2,HTN, prior stroke, left thumb MRSA infection complicated by
lumbar osteomyelitis s/p decompression, seizure disorder with
falls at home.The patient was hospitalized on the neurosurgery
service about 1 yr ago for lumbar decompressive
surgery for his osteomyelitis.
He had a witnessed GTCS about 4-5 days ago at his home. Before
that he had a fall 2-3 weeks ago. He was taken to OSH for
managemnt of his seizure. He was noted to have significant
weakness over his left UL, LL and left sided facial droop at
OSH.
This weakness, as per communication with his daughter and
documents appers to be very new. The residual weakness resulting
from stroke is on his right side and that too has significantly
improved over time. Initailly he was thoiught to have a stroke,
and was evaluated with CT/MRI Brain which did not show any new
stroke. It however showed a small subacute-chronic SDH over
right parietal area. His weakness was thought to be Todds
paresis vs Cervical myelopathy.
He underwent MRI of his cervical spine which showed a
significant stensosis at c4 c5 area and hence he was refd to
[**Hospital1 18**]. In the meantime he was given methyprednisone, his
weakness per daughter improved somewhat after the steroids but
still much less as compared to baseline. Moreever the patient is
talkative,
irritable and this is something new per his daughter.
With regard to his seizures, began 3-4 years ago, followed by
neurology at [**Hospital1 1474**] VA, typical seizure characterized as
staring spells followed by generalized stiffening, + postictal
period following. Has been well controlled on dilantin.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring.  His exam
remained with left leg greater than left arm weakness.  He was
readied for the OR.  He was also seen in consultation by stroke
neurology who felt his symptoms and MRI were not compatible with
stroke.  On [**10-8**] he went to OR where under general anesthesia he
underwent ACDF C4-5.  He tolerated this procedure well, was
extubated transferred to PACU and then floor.  His post op exam
showed marked improvement in left weakness - able to lift leg
off the bed.  Diet and activity were advanced. His wound was
clean and dry.  His was seen in consultation by PT/OT who felt
he was appropriate for rehab. He was seen by orthopedics for
chronic right shoulder injury/fracture. They recommended the
patient's shoulder be placed in a sling, and recommend
outpatient follow up in the ortho clinic in [**3-19**] weeks.  His
urine showed normal UA but culture grew staph on [**10-6**].  Repeat
UA and urine culture were done, bacteria grew and were speciated
and appropriate antibiotics were begun.

On [**10-11**] he began to have poor oral intake, specifically with
thin liquids and even custard/applesauce, so IV fluids were used
to keep the patient hydrated. Speech/swallow team reevaluated
the patient and he continued to be at high risk for aspirating.
General surgery consult was requested for PEG placement which
patient consented to and was performed without difficulty [**10-16**].
His exam at discharge showed full strength throught with the
exception of right deltoid/trapezius which pt refused to test
due to right shoulder pain.  Orthopedics did see patient in
house and requested follow up as outpt in [**3-19**] weeks to consider
shoulder replacement.  He used sling which helped with pain
relief.

He worked with PT and OT during hospital stay who recommended
rehab placement.
