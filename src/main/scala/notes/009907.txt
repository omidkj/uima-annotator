CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2112-9-28**] 3:43 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: Please eval for infiltrate/interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old man with bilateral pleural effusions with new oxygen
requirement.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for infiltrate/interval change
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation for interval change in a
patient with bilateral pleural effusions.

Portable radiograph was reviewed and compared to [**9-24**]
and [**2112-9-22**]. Overall gradual increase of bilateral
pleural effusions . The cardiac silhouette is markedly increased
due to known right atrial enlargement and pericardial effusion.
The distal portion of pacemaker lead terminates in the right
ventricle.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing
wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Dilated IVC
(>2.5cm) with no
change with respiration (estimated RAP >20 mmHg). Dilated
coronary sinus
(diameter >15mm).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF
(>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Markedly dilated RV cavity. RV
function
depressed.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Mildly
dilated aortic
arch. Focal calcifications in aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. Mild AS (AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2).

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Thickened/fibrotic
tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Severe [4+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion. Ascites.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. The coronary sinus
is dilated
(diameter >15mm). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in
the aortic
arch. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2112-6-15**], both atria are even more dilated (massive biatrial
enlargement is
present) and th tricuspid regurgitation is now frankly severe.
