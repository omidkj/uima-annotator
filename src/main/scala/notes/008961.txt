Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for complaints of
dysphagia and intolerance to certain foods, and was found to
have a migrated esophageal stent, with esophageal stricture. He
was taken to the operating room on [**2119-10-9**] where Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a redo laparotomy, with lysis of
adhesions, substernal colon interposition with creation of
coloesophageal and cologastric anastomosis, partial resection of
manubrium, clavicle, and first rib, and a feeding jejunostomy.
The patient recovered in the intensive care unit, and was
transfered to the floor on [**2119-10-12**].

He underwent swallow evaluation [**2119-10-13**] revealing patent
coloesophageal and cologastric anastomoses without evidence of
leak. Prompt distal passage of contrast into the small bowel
with minimal contrast retention in the neoesophagus. The patient
is tolerating tube feedings, along with full liquid diet.

Pain management has been a big issue, along with anxiety. The
patient was transitioned to oxycontin on Monday [**2119-10-16**] and has
had anxiety mostly controlled with lorazepam.

PT evaluated the patient and deemed him safe to transfer home.
The patients wife is aware of these recommendations. The patient
and wife were given written and verbal DC instructions, and
showed repeat demonstration on JP management, as abdominal JP's
remained in the patient given its continued drainage.
