Service:  CCU
This is an interim discharge summary; will have follow-up
discharge summary.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89 year old man with
hypertension, negative stress Thallium in [**2174-1-1**], who
diaphoresis while watching television at 8:10 p.m. the night
of admission.  It was followed by a syncopal episode times
one.

He arrived to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department at
9:10 p.m. with a blood pressure of 62/32.  An
electrocardiogram was done at that time which showed ST
anterior leads and a third degree heart block.  He was lysed
with Retavase 10 cc times two at 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. and
started on Heparin, Aspirin, Aggrestat and Dopamine.

He was electively intubated prior to [**Location (un) 7622**] and taken
directly to catheterization laboratory upon admission to [**Hospital1 1444**].

Cardiac catheterization showed no significant disease of the
left main, mild diffuse disease of the left anterior
descending, right coronary artery was a small vessel without
disease, and total occlusion of proximal dominant CX.
Hemodynamics Swan showed  pulmonary artery pressures of 45/22,
wedge pressure of 22 and right atrial pressure of 7.

While in the catheterization laboratory, the patient
developed multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia during
the attempted pacemaker placement for transient complete heart
block.   Amiodarone was started.  He was transferred to the CCU
intubated and on Dopamine.

6.  Negative stress Thallium in [**2174-1-1**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Transurethral resection of prostate.
2.  Gastrectomy [**2144**], for peptic ulcer disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no drugs, no alcohol.  The
patient lives with wife.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to CCU, temperature was
93.3, blood pressure 108/64, heart rate 84, respiratory rate
12, oxygen saturation 96% on FIO2 of 100%.  In general, the
patient is intubated and sedated.  The endotracheal tube and
oral gastric tube are in place.  His jugular venous
distention was not elevated and his neck was supple.  His
chest was clear to auscultation anteriorly, but the patient
was lying flat due to femoral catheter.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate, soft S1 and normal S2.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.  His abdomen
was soft.  He had a healed midline scar.  On abdominal
examination, it was nontender, nondistended, normoactive
bowel sounds were present.  Femoral sheath was in place in
the right groin.  There was no bruit but minimal oozing was
present at the site.  He had 0-1+ posterior tibialis and
dorsalis pedis pulses on the left and 1+ to 2+ posterior
tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses on the right.  The skin
was warm and dry.  There was slight pallor to the skin
diffusely.  On neurologic examination, he opened eyes
occasionally.  He was not able to follow commands.  His
pupils were dilated.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white blood cell count was
22.4, hemoglobin 10.3, hematocrit 31.1, platelets 334,000.
Prothrombin time 14.3, partial thromboplastin time 33.8, INR
1.4.  Sodium 135, potassium 4.0, chloride 107, bicarbonate
17, blood urea nitrogen 23, creatinine 0.9, glucose 299.  CK
peaked at 4609 on admission, CK MB 624 with an index of 13.5
also peaked on admission.  Troponin I was greater than 50.
Triglycerides 61, HDL 53, LDL 71.

Electrocardiogram performed at outside hospital [**2174-8-16**], at
9:00 p.m. showed 2:1 AV block, 2.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevations
in the inferior leads, 3.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depressions in V1
through V3.  Repeat electrocardiogram at outside hospital
[**2174-8-16**], at 2230 showed first degree AV delay, 3.0 to 4.[**Street Address(2) 27948**] elevation in II, 2.0 to 3.[**Street Address(2) 2811**]
elevation in III and aVF, ST depressions in V1 through V4.

Transthoracic echocardiogram performed [**2174-8-17**], showed an
ejection fraction of 35 to 40% with moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting regional wall
motion abnormalities including inferolateral akinesis and
basal inferior akinesis, mild inferior hypokinesis, mild
aortic stenosis, 1+ mitral regurgitation.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 89 year old man with very large
inferior posterior ST elevation myocardial infarction with
third degree AV block, lysed at outpatient hospital.  The
patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory where he
was found to have one vessel disease and a stent placed to
the left circumflex artery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Coronary artery disease - The patient presented from
outside hospital after being given thrombolytics and taken to
the cardiac catheterization laboratory where he was found to
have one vessel disease, left circumflex, which was stented
with zero percent residual stenosis.  He was continued on
Aggrestat for eighteen hours, started on Aspirin and Plavix.

His cardiac enzymes were cycled and showed a peak on his
admission laboratories of CK 4609, MB fraction 624 and an
index of 13.5 with a troponin greater than 50.  Cardiac
enzymes trended down through his hospital course.

He was initially started on Lipitor 10 mg but was
discontinued when LDL came back at 71 with a total
cholesterol of 136.  Lopressor was started and titrated to
tolerance.
2.  Systolic dysfunction - A transthoracic echocardiogram
performed [**2174-8-17**], showed a depressed ejection fraction of
35 to 40%.  He was treated with
Neo-Synephrine and Milrinone for hypotension and low cardiac
outputs for  approximately the first week
of CCU stay. Pressors were weaned to off on
approximately CCU day number six and Captopril was slowly
titrated up as blood pressure tolerated.  He also required
diuresis and had net negative three liters from dry weight at the
time of dictation.

3.  Arrhythmias - The patient presented from outside hospital
with electrocardiograms consistent with third degree heart
block.  This did not recur after reperfusion.  he had 2 episodes
of sustained ventricular tachycardia during the first 48 hours
and was treated with Amiodarone.  This was discontinued when
after development of acute lung infiltrate and hypoxia without
recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias.
 4. Pulmonary- The patient was electively intubated prior to
transport from outside hospital.  Serial chest x-rays were
performed while in the Intensive Care Unit which indicated
congestive heart failure with a consolidation in the left
lobe.  He was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia and
aggressively diuresed.  Due to chest x-ray and clinical
findings, he was transiently switched to adult respiratory
distress syndrome ventilation protocol with increased
respiratory rate and decreased tidal volumes. The infiltrate
slowly resolved and  he was extubated [**2174-8-28**], and was
tolerating extubation well at the time of dictation.

5.  Infectious disease - The patient developed fever on CCU
day number two which continued for approximately the first
week of hospital course.  He was pancultured with a negative
urine culture and sputum culture with one of four blood
cultures positive for alpha Streptococcus thought to be a
contaminant.  He was continued on antibiotic regimen which
included Levaquin, Vancomycin and Flagyl for a fourteen day
course covering aspiration pneumonia.  His fever defervesced
upon starting Flagyl.  The Swan catheter tip was cultured and
found to be negative.

6.  Hematology - The patient's hematocrit dropped as low as
26 throughout hospital stay and he was transfused a total of
four units packed red blood cells at the time of dictation.
He has been stable with a hematocrit of 130 for a number of
days after transfusion.  His drop in hematocrit was thought
most likely secondary to a small groin hematoma post cardiac
catheterization.  The patient was guaiac negative.

7.  Endocrine - The patient was with elevated blood sugar
close to 300 on the first
