   ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2126-3-6**]):    NO GROWTH.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2126-3-2**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.

EKG [**2-25**]:  Sinus tachycardia and occasional ventricular ectopy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2125-7-24**] there are now more
prominent Q waves suggesting interim inferior myocardial
infarction. In addition, the ST segment depressions in leads I,
II, III and aVF are more prominent. Both atrial and ventricular
ectopy have appeared, the rate has increased and there is more
prominent downsloping ST segment depression in leads V5-V6. Rule
out myocardial infarction.

Catheterization [**2-25**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Retrograde access was obtained via the right CFA using a 6
French
sheath. Abdominal aortic angiography demonstrated moderate
distal
disease with a small infrarenal saccular aneurysm.
2. Nonselective angiography of the bilateral, single renal
arteries
demonstrated 40% proximal disease bilaterally.
3. The right CIA had a 50% lesion in the origin with a 6 mmHg
mean
gradient after administration of IA nitroglycerin. There was
diffuse
disease in the rightIIA with up to 50% stenoses.
4. The left CIA had proximal 60% disease with a 40 mmHg
peak-to-peak
gradient. The IIA had diffuse 40% disease. The distal EIA had an

eccentric 60% stenosis. The left SFA was ostially occluded and
reconstituted at the adductor canal. The left PFA had a 50%
lesion at
its origin. No angiographically apparent, flow-limiting disease
was
noted in the popliteal aftery. The AT had serial lesions with a
total
occlusion in the mid-shin. Slow filling was noted of the DP. The

peroneal had mild disease and terminated at the ankle. The PT
was the
principle vessel to the foot.
5. Successful treatment of the totally occluded left SFA using
adventitial dissection, an Outback catheter, angioplasty, and
stenting
with three overlapping self-expanding stents (from distal to
proximal
6.0 x 100 mm Absolute, 6.0 x 100 mm Dynalink, and 6.0 x 80 mm
Absolute)
all postdilated with a 6.0 mm balloon. Final angiography
demonstrated no
residual stenosis, a small proximal perforation, a distal
perforation
treated with prolonged balloon inflation and protamine, and
normal flow
(See PTCA Comments).
6. Successful treatment of ostial left PFA disease with a 5.0 x
18 mm
Highsail balloon. Final angigoraphy demonstrated a 30% residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal
flow (See
PTCA Comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild abdominal aorta and renal artery disease.
2. Moderate disease in the right CIA and IIA.
3. Diffuse disease in left lower extremity with totally occluded
SFA.
4. Successful stenting of left SFA.
5. Balloon angioplasty of the left PFA.
6. Perforation of the distal SFA treated with balloon inflation
and
protamine.

Arterial Duplex [**2-27**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of left leg
pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.

Catheterization [**2-27**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Initial angiography was obtained by access of the right CFA
to the
contralateral left SFA using a 6 French sheath. The abdominal
aorta had
mild distal disease.
2. The right lower extremity was significant for a right CIA
with a
tubular 70% lesion.
3. The left lower extremity was significant for a left CIA with
a 90%
focal lesion. The EIA had an 80% lesion in the midsegment as
well as a
90% distal EIA lesion. The CFA had no significant disease. The
previous
stents in the SFA was without significant disease and normal
flow. The
distal perforation site was sealed. The origin of the SFA had a
70%
dissection. The origin of the PFA had a 70% tubular lesion.
4. Successful atherectomy using a SilverHawk LS device on the
left SFA,
PFA, and EIA. An 8.0 x 28 mm Dynalink self-expanding stent was
delivered
to the proximal EIA and postdilated with a 6.0 x 12 mm Viatrack
balloon
at 12 ATM. Final angiography demonstrated a 10% residual
stenosis in the
PFA, no residual stenosis, in the SFA, no residual stenosis in
the EIA,
no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.
5. The left proximal CIA lesion was dilated with an 8.0 x 38 mm
Genesis
stent at 12 ATM. Final angiography demonstrated no residual
stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.
6. The right CIA was stented with an 8.0 x 29 mm Genesis stent
at 12
ATM. A perforation was noted which was treated with multiple 5
minute
balloon inflations, administration of protamine, and finally
placement
of an 8.0 x 30 mm WallGraft covered stent postdilated with an
8.0 mm SDS
balloon. Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, a
small
persistent perforation, and normal flow.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Significant disease in the right CIA.
2. Significant disease in the left CIA, EIA, SFA, and PFA.
3. Successful atherectomy of the left SFA, PFA, and EIA.
4. Successful stenting of the left EIA.
5. Successful stenting of the left CIA.
6. Successful stenting of the right CIA.
7. Perforation of the right CIA treated with protamine, blood
pressure
control, prolonged balloon inflations, and a covered stent.

EKG [**2-27**]:  Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V delay.  Probable
left atrial abnormality.  Prominent inferior Q waves - are
nonspecific.  Modest nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.  Since
