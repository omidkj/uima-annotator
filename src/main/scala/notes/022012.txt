stable and neurologically intact. About 2300 resident was call
for activity suggestive of a seizure. Ct head obtained without
acute changes.blood gsases shwed patient ventilating and
oxygenating adequately. Neuro was consulted.FElt symptoms [**Last Name (un) 8966**]
secondary to embolic etology or ( but less likely) re expression
of old deficits. in the setting of bradycardia and hypotension.
Maintain systolic blood pressure greater than 130. continue
antiplatlet thearphy moniter neruro status. optmize glycemic
control.CT head obtained no bleed or or developing ischemia.

held for stooling.Remains in SICU.REpeat EEG remains negative
for seizure activity.Neuro felt mental status changes secondary
to metabilic encelopathy.

liquids. and significant orapharyngeal dysphagia. Continue tube
feed and
maintain NPO.. Will require speech thearphy at rehab facility to
address dysphagia and dysarthria, and likely right hemisphere
cognitive-linguistic defecits.GI service conslulted.Endoscopic
PEG placed. [**2199-10-2**]. Seen by OT and recommend rehablitittion
would be benefical . has not met goals set by them on first
visit [**9-26**].

over the weekend. repeat MRI of head done.no new changes.
Improved mental status to baseline. Tube feed slowly progressed
@ time of discharge promote with fiber [**2-7**] strnght @ 70 cc/hr.
Check residuals q4h if <100cc increase tube feed to 75cc and in
eight hours to 80cc if residule <100cc. Patient then will be at
goal rate.Patient tolerating feeds.
