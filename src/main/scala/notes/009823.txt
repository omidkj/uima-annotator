carcinomatosis.
Increase in size/number of innumerable hepatic metastasis and
large pancreatic mass consistent with significant interval
progression of disease. Evid of splenic infarcts.

.
[**2-4**] Noncontrast Head CT: No sign of hemorrhage, shift. No overt
interval change from [**2161-1-31**]. No overt extracranial

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old female with breast ca and progressive metastatic
pancreatic ca who presented with acute shortness of breath and
was found to have bilateraly pulmonary emboli. She was started
on IV heparin but developed a persistent GI bleed.  Her mental
status remained poor despite holding sedating medications and
negative head CT.  Given her poor prognosis due to her
progressive cancer, bilateral pulmonary emboli and inability to
anticoagulate due to persistent GI bleeding, her family made the
decision to make the patient DNR/DNI and eventually CMO.  She
was started on a morphine drip and continued on oxygen mask for
comfort.  She died on [**2161-2-10**] at 2:50pm.
