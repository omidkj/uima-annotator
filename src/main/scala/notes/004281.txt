History of Present Illness:
73YO male with hx CAD s/p CABG with redo [**2120**], CHF with EF 30%,
afib, DM, CRI, PVD who has recent [**Hospital1 18**] stay last month for
decompensated heart failure and ARF that required CCU stay for
tailored therapy and CVVH presents today with worsening DOE. Pt
reports that he has been working with [**Hospital 1902**] clinic to try to
manage his weight gain of 11 lbs since being discharged on
[**2139-4-18**]. His metolazone has been tepered off and his lasix was
increased to 120mg QAM/ 80mg QPM (from 80mg [**Hospital1 **]). He reports
increased DOE today during his work as an [**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Hospital1 778**]. This
worsened to the point that he got SOB walking across a room. He
had some transient chest tightness that was relieved with rest
but no ongoing chest pain. He has chronic non-productive cough,
no fever. He has marked increase in his LE edema in past [**1-26**]
weeks, L>R per baseline. He had a stress test just 4 days ago
that showed defects and is aware that cath is planned for him in
the near future. He has no ongoing SOB currently. He notes easy
fatiguability but - n/v, abd pain. dizziness, LH. -PND,
-orthopnea.  He uses 2 pillows at night.

Past Medical History:
CAD (CABG [**2109**] AND [**2120**])
CHF w/ EF 30%, diastolic dysfx
- recent admit with CCU transfer for tailored therapy [**3-30**]. The
patient had a Swan line placed and initially was maintained on
dopamine and vasopressin. His wedge was 33, PAP 63/29, cardiac
output 4.4, cardiac index 2.07. Numbers improved when placed on
Milrinone. He ultimately required CVVH due to severe volume
overload. He was stabilized and transferred back to a floor
where he was maintained on Lasix and metolazone with good urine
output and faily stable renal
function.

[**2139-5-12**] CXR:
1. Mild pulmonary edema.
2. Left lower lobe patchy atelectasis versus pneumonia.
.
[**2139-5-12**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Since the previous
tracing of [**2138-4-6**] the rate has decreased. ST-T wave
abnormalities are more
marked. Clinical correlation is suggested
.
[**2139-5-14**]
BRIEF HISTORY:   73 year old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy
(EF 20%)
referred for cardiac catheterization for non-ST elevation MI. HI
last
catheterization was on [**2131-4-12**] that showed left dominant system
with
patent LMCA and ramus only, otherwise occluded LAD, LCX, and
RCA. The
LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, and SVG-PDA were all patent.


INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class II,  stable.
Prior CABG
[**2109**] & [**2120**].

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Graft Angiography: of 2 saphenous vein bypass grafts was
performed using
a 5 French right [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Arterial Conduit Angiography:  of a left internal mammary artery
graft
was performed using a preformed [**Female First Name (un) 899**] catheter, with manual
contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Percutaneous coronary revascularization of an additional vessel
was
performed using placement of drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
