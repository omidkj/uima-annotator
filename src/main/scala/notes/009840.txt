Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was
performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions
(see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] notified in person.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being AV paced.

1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 15 mmHg). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. MR is improved to [**1-26**] +
3. Ascending aorta is intact post decannulation
4. Other findings are unchanged
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2643**] was admitted and underwent cardiac catherization which
revealed no significant coronary artery disease but did confirm
severe aortic stenosis. On [**3-7**] she was brought to the operating
room, in holding area prior to surgery she was noted for
hematuria.  Urology was consulted, three wat foley was placed,
no cystoscopy indicated and was okay to heparinize for valve
replacement surgery.  She under went an aortic valve
replacement, please see operative report for further details.
She was transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic
monitoring.  In the first twenty four hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
complications.  On post operative day one she was started on
beta blockers and diuretics.  Her foley remained in but she had
no hematuria post operatively, it was discussed with urology,
urine for cytology sent, and plan for follow up as outpatient
with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11189**], appointment [**2125-4-26**].  She was transferred to the
floor for the remainder of her care.  Physical therapy worked
with her on strength and mobility.  On post operative day two
she experienced rapid atrial fibrillation and remained
hemodynamically stable. Beta-blockers were optimized, Amiodar
