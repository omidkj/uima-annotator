Chief Complaint:
right internal carotid bifurcation aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cranitomy for clipping of aneurysm


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 12330**] is a 62-year-old woman who presented back in the
summer of [**2131**] with a high-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage from a
ruptured left posterior communicating artery aneurysm. She
underwent successful endovascular coil embolization of the
aneurysm with preservation of the left fetal posterior cerebral
artery origin. Since then, she made a remarkable recovery and
underwent follow-up angiography which revealed a stable
appearance of her left posterior communicating artery aneurysm.
In addition at that time, she was noted to [**Hospital1 **] a wide necked,
right internal carotid artery bifurcation aneurysm which had not
ruptured and which was not deemed suitable for endovascular
therapy. Accordingly, she is undergoing this craniotomy for
clipping of this aneurysm giving her high risk for rupture with
a history of previous subarachnoid hemorrhage.

RADIOLOGY:

[**2132-12-24**] Cerebral angiogram: stable with no bleeding [full report
not available at time of this dictation]

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 year old female with a known right internal carotid
aneurysm who was admitted for elective clipping of this known
aneurysm given her recent history of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
She tolerated this procedure well without complications.
Post-operatively she was extubated and transferred to the
intensive care unit for close blood pressure and neurologic
monitorring. Her post-operative course was uneventful and she
remained neurologically stable with stable vital signs. Her pain
was well controlled throughout her post-operative course. She
underwent a cerebral angiogram on post-operative day 1 which
demonstrated no acute bleeding and stable vasculature [full
report was not available at the time of this dictation]. She was
transferred to the floor on post-operative day 1 in stable
condition. She was discharged on post-operative day 2 in stable
condition with planned follow-up in 1 week for re-evaluation and
staple removal. All questions were answered to her satisfaction
at time of discharge.
