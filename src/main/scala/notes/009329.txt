History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo M w/PMHx x for seizures and mental
retardation who was admitted from the ED as a transfer from an
OSH after a 40 minute episode of status epilepticus. He was in
his USOH at his nursing home today when he developed acute onset
of seizures for approx 40 minutes prior to arrival of EMS. He
was given Valium and versed and brought to [**Hospital 81472**], where
he was intubated for airway protection, and given Dilantin,
Ativan, and ceftriaxone and vancomycin. He was noted to have
fevers to 105 at [**Hospital3 3583**]. From there, he was transferred
to our ED, where he was extubated without difficulty. He was
noted to have elevated cardiac enzymes, and a bedside echo was
performed which showed no acute wall motion abnormalities. An LP
was attempted and was unsuccessful. Patient is currently
nonverbal.

Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
overall normal systolic function (focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded). Moderately dilated ascending aorta
and aortic root.
.
EKG: NSR. No acute ST-T changes.
CXR: Negative for infiltrate.

[**2-6**]: MRI C-spine:

INDICATION: New paralysis, seizure, fever.

COMPARISON: No previous studies.

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR images of
the cervical
spine, with axial gradient echo images. Following intravenous
gadolinium
administration, sagittal and axial T1-weighted images were
obtained.

FINDINGS: Vertebral body height, alignment, and bone marrow
signal are
normal. There is no evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis,
epidural collection,
leptomeningeal enhancement, or paravertebral collection.

At C3/4, there is a broad-based disc/osteophyte complex
resulting in mild
spinal canal stenosis. There is no deformation of the spinal
cord.

At C5/6, there is a large right paracentral disc extrusion
extending
inferiorly, which indents the right anterior aspect of the
spinal cord and
displaces the cord to the left. There is no evidence of cord
signal
abnormalities. There is moderate spinal canal stenosis. The
protrusion also
extends into the right neural foramen, resulting in moderate
narrowing.

At C6/7, there is a broad-based disc/osteophyte complex which
results in mild
spinal canal stenosis. There is no deformation of the spinal
cord.

The imaged portion of the posterior fossa appears unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis, epidural collection,
or
paravertebral collection.

2. Large right paracentral and foraminal disc protrusion at
C5/6, which
indents the right anterior spinal cord and results in moderate
spinal canal
stenosis. The right neural foramen is moderately narrowed.

3. Mild spinal canal stenosis at C3/4 and at C6/7.

MRI Head without contrast:

FINDINGS: There is no focus of abnormal slow diffusion to
suggest infarct.
MRA is limited, and evaluation of the intracranial vessels is
not possible;
however, the vertebral, basilar, and internal carotid arteries
appear grossly
patent. There is no evidence of hemorrhage. No shift of midline
structures
identified.

IMPRESSION: Limited study, demonstrating no evidence of
hemorrhage or
infarct. Limited MRA demonstrates patent vertebral, basilar, and
internal
carotid arteries; however, evaluation of the intracranial
vessels is not
possible.


Brief Hospital Course:
68M with mental retardation (documented prior baseline MS is
that of a 2year old), h/o PE/DVT on chronic lifelong, CHF,
hypokalemia now with multiple medical issues including suspected
cord compression with quadriparesis (though with some
improvements in neuro status able to move [**3-29**] extrem (still
can't move RUE), presumed meningitis, initially severe
hypokalemia, NSTEMI (demand induced), and seizures upon
presentation, with working dx of meningitis).  Pt initially
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] before transfer to inpatient floor.
<br>

# Suspected cord compression with quadriparesis:
Neurology and Neurosurgical team followed patient.  Patient was
put into a cervial [**Location (un) **]-J collar and this should be continued
for 4-6 weeks until seen by neurosurgery as outpatient.
Neurosurgery may consider future intervention but wanted to wait
until after infection cleared.  Follow up appointment were
arranged with neurology and neurosurgery.
<br>

# Suspected meningitis:
There was a high suspicion for meningitis, given constellation
of fevers, WBC, seizure. Neurology team recommending against LP
given cord compression.  MRI was done and was considered poor
yield given sig time on abx. Patient will be given empiric
vanc/ctx/amp/acyclovir for 14 day treatment course.  Patient
will follow up with neuro as an outpatient.
<br>

# Seizures:  The patient had seizures at admission.  The
apateitn had no further episodes after that.  The patient was
continued on his fosphenytoin 100 IV q8
initially.  Neuro though it would be best to transition to
keppra. Plan is for 3 days, then plan for 500mg qam/1000mg qpm
for 3 days, then for 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for 3 days, then for 1000
qam/1500mg qpm for 3 days, then 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] continuously then.
Once at 1000/1500mg dosing will start slowly weaning OFF
phenytoin (switched to fosphenytoin [**2-10**] from phenytoin as less
risk for crystalization in picc)
<br>

# NSTEMI:
Demand related. echo showed no evidence of wall motion
abnormality
Patient was given asa, lipitor and low dose beta blocker
<br>

# Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient appeared euvolemic during his
hospital course.  Diuretics [**Last Name (un) 8966**] held due to persistent
hypokalemia.  Fluid status should be monitored closely at LTAC
and diuretics should be restarted as needed.
<br>

# Hypokalemia:
Renal was consulted.  They felt that it was likely diuretic
related.  They did not feel that there was an underlying kidney
disorder.  Patient will be discharged on daily KCl.  Her K
should be monitored closely at his LTAC.
<br>

# h/o DVT/PE:
Has been anticoagulated chronically as an outpt.  Patient was
continuexd on warfarin.  His INR should be monitored closely aat
LTAC facility.
