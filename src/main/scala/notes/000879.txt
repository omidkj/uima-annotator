Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal regional LV systolic function. Mild
global LV hypokinesis. Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Off pump CABG

1. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.

2.Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).

3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

7. Post revascularization inferior wall is moderately
hypokinetic. EF 40%

He was transferred to cardiac surgery. On [**1-21**] he was taken to
the operating room on where he underwent an off pump CABG x 3.
He was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. He was
