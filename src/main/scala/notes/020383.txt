History of Present Illness:
78M with h/o Parkinson's Disease, CAD s/p CABG, h/o TIA, s/p
recent hospitalization for pna ([**Date range (1) 65931**]) now with worsening
weakness. Per pt's wife since he got sick with the pneumonia his
Parkinson's has been acting up and he has been having increasing

In the ED, initial VS were T: 99.8F BP: 171/109 HR: 102 RR: 18
SaO2: 98% on 2L NC. Initial labs were notable for leukocytosis
to 17
(89% N). CXR demonstrated resolving RML and RLL PNA. Pt was
given Tylenol 650mg po, aspirin 325mg po, vancomycin 1g IV,
Zosyn 4.5g IV, ticlid 250mg, carbidopa 25/Levodopa 100, Comtan

dropped to systolics in the 80's. He was then given boluses of
1L NS x 3 and BP improved to 120's and he was transferred to the
MICU.

GEN: pt very somnolent, awakens to voice but then falls asleep
again.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP slightly dry.
NECK: No carotid bruit, + elevated JVP.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2118-4-17**]: Two views of the chest demonstrate stable [**Month/Day/Year 1192**]
cardiomegaly, mediastinal contours, and sternal sutures. There
has been significant improvement in airspace opacity of the
right middle and lower lobes seen on [**2118-4-10**]. A small amount
of residual opacity remains in these locales. The left lung is
clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There has
been no change from [**2118-4-10**] in multiple thoracic vertebral wedge
deformities and associated kyphosis.
IMPRESSION: Improving right middle and right lower lobe
pneumonia.
.
ECG: NSR at 97. nl axis, borderline QT interval. Q's in III
(old). ST depressions in I, II, AVL, V3-6 (old), J point
elevation in V1-2 (old). No sig changes from prior.
.
[**4-19**] cxr:
IMPRESSION:
1. NG tube in proximal stomach.
2. Progressive multifocal pneumonia.
.
[**4-21**] head ct:
FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. Irregular low
attenuation foci in bilateral lentiform nuclei, left greater
than right with associated volume loss are consistent with
chronic lacunar infarction. Scattered focal low attenuation
lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter are
consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. The surrounding soft tissue
and osseous structures are unremarkable. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. No change
since [**2117-12-10**].
.
cxr [**4-21**]: IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema. Worsening left
lower lobe pneumonia
.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in
echotexture with no focal masses. A nonshadowing gallstone or
sludge ball is seen within the gallbladder measuring 8 x 7 x 5
mm. The common bile duct measures 4 mm. There is no biliary
dilatation. The portal vein is patent with antegrade flow. There
is no ascites. The right kidney measures 11.2 cm, and there is
no hydronephrosis.

IMPRESSION: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo M with Parkinson's, CAD, s/p recent admission for pna now
with likely aspiration pna [**2-25**] increased secretions
.
Micu course involved, the patient had hypotension and was given
IVF and zosyn/vanc (concern for pna/sepsis). The patient had
angioedema and was switched to levo/flagyl. Given his
hypotension his lasix was held as were other bp meds. He failed
his speech and swallow and had an ngt placed. He was
normotensive and transferred to the floor.
.
Floor course:
# hypotension: The patient's hypotension resolved since
receiving IVF. The cause was likely multifactorial including
poor intake likely due to parkinsons's disease, increased
diarrhea and finally possibly some sepsis as with white count
and pneumonia. During the majority of the patient's course he
was npo so IVF were continued and he was treated for his
pneumonia.  His blood pressure was normal on the floor and his
blood pressure medications were reintroduced as tolerated.
.
# pneumonia: The patient had presumed aspiration pneumonia as
the patient had increased secretions.  In the MICU he was on
zosyn and vancomycin but had angioedema and due to this allergic
reaction, he was switched to levofloxacin and flagyl.  He
continued to fail speech and swallow evaluations given his
increased secretions.  During his course he developed an
increased white count, an increased work of breathing and
tachypnea.  His cxr showed worsening and he was presumed to have
worsened aspiration pneumonia, especially given his ongoing risk
of aspiration.  He was put on daptomycin, flagyl and aztreonam
and he improved, initially though he continued to aspirate and
his continued aspiration made his pneumonia worse to the point
where his prognosis was poor.  The patient had an episode of
hypoxia and tachycardia, which was attributed to his increasing
secretions.  He was aggressively suctioned and a scopalamine
patch was placed, but given this and his poor prognosis the
family decided to make the patient CMO.  Antibiotics were
discontinued and the patient was given morphine and scopalamine
for comfort.
.
# Parkinson's: The family fears the patient's parkinson's is
worsening, though the patient's recent decline in functioning
and mentation could also be related to his infection.  He was
continued on his home doses of carbidopa/levodopa and
entacapone, and he appeared less lethargic and bradykinetic as
his infection improved.  The patient's outpatient neurologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65932**], was contact[**Name (NI) **] and he recommended keeping his
medications at the same dose and having an inpatient neurologist
see him.  The inpatient team did not have any medication changes
to add, though they recommended Movement Disorders consult as
his dysphagia may have been related to Progressive Supranuclear
Palsy.  During the patient's course he lost his NG tube and he
had difficulty with oral intake to the point where he could not
receive his parkinson's medications.  The pharmacy did not carry
the oral disintegrating sinemet, and neurology said they could
not recommend alternative IV medications to treat his
parkinson's.  Unfortunately without his medications the patient
became more
