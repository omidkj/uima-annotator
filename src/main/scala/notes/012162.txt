History of Present Illness:
34 year-old woman with a history of refractory epilepsy and
[**Doctor Last Name **] encephalitis transferred from OSH with increased
seizure frequency. Unfortunately, pt is unaccompanied and
presently non-verbal so most of history from medical record.
.
Per OSH records, EMS arrived at pt's apt a few minutes after a
generalized convulsion per visiting nurse who was present.
Visiting RN also reported pt had 6 focal seizures in ~35
minutes. Pt had at least 1 more generalized seizure at OSH and
multiple focal right face seizures, and received ativan 1mg x2
and used the VNS magnet as well. She was initially unresponsive
on arrival to OSH, and developed increased alertness while
there but she was using her right arm only minimally and was
non-
verbal, which is atypical for her. Labs and head CT were
unremarkable (see below) except for AED levels that were low-
normal. She was transferred for further management.
.
Pt is unable to tell me how many focal or generlized seizures
she
has had today. She reports having ~30 seizures yesterday. At
baseline per OMR notes she has 5-10 per day.
.
ROS: No fever, chills. +Cough for 2 days. No headache, chest
pain, sore throat.


Past Medical History:
1. Epilepsy. Seizures started at age 11, with remission from age
16 to 22. Has right facial motor seizures daily, exact frequency
unclear. Unclear baseline frequency of GTC. Did well during
pregnancy with seizure control, currently meds being titrated
down. Also with VNS.
2. OSA, previous OMR notes report CPAP 11, unable to verify if
currently using given mental status
3. Multiple injuries [**12-27**] seizures
4. h/o right arm and leg fracture
5. Migraine headache
6. [**Doctor Last Name 73**] encephalitis
7. Cervical cancer s/p laser surgery


Social History:
Has visiting nurse, lives with fiancee and new baby. Uses
wheelchair at home.


Family History:
Adopted, kids with no seizures


Physical Exam:
T 99.9  BP 124/79  HR 90s  RR 15  O2 sat 100% 4L NC
(though RR 30 and O2 sat 93% when having focal seizure)
General: Appears stated age, frequent motor seizures
HEENT: NC/AT Sclera anicteric. OP clear
Neck: Supple
Lungs: +Cough, few bibasilar crackles
CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no murmur.
Abd: Soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
Extr: No edema
.
Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status: Awake, somewhat sleepy with yawning, inattentive.
Mostly non-verbal, occasionally moans and rarely says words or
phrases. Answers questions (nods, shakes head, can point to word
or numbers on page but does not write) and follows simple
commands mostly appropriately but is extremely slow to do so. No
obvious neglect.
.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 5 to
3 mm bilaterally, brisk. Extraocular movements intact, bilateral
end-gaze nystagmus. Facial sensation intact to light touch.
Right
facial droop, varying severity depending on how far out from
focal seizure. Normal oropharyngeal movement. Tongue midline, no
fasciculations. Has multiple mostly right face motor seizures,
begin with tonic phase and then followed by clonic involving
platysma as well as orbicularis oculus and oris with some tongue
and jaw involvement as well.
.
Motor: Normal bulk and tone bilaterally, fasiculations absent in
upper and lower extremities. No tremor. Formal strength testing
complicated by some inattention, giveway weakness and poor
effort. However, left arm is full strength. Right arm with
pronator drift, and at least 4/5 strength. Legs with bilateral
IP
weakness but at least 3, left dorsiflexion full and right
dorsiflexion at least 4.
.
Sensation was intact to light touch in all 4 extremities.
.
Reflexes: DTRs trace to absent throughout. Toes withdrew.
.
Coordination is normal on finger-nose-finger on left, did not
perform on right.
Gait deferred.

Torso CT 12/01:1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation and patchy
opacity in the right upper lobe. Given the distribution,
aspiration should be considered.
2. A 9-mm segment of small bowel intussusception, that likely
represents so- called "transient intussusception." There is no
evidence of proximal dilatation or obstruction of small bowel.

----
CT head [**10-26**]:There is opacification of multiple paranasal
sinuses, likely related to the patient's intubation. Again seen
is a left frontoparietal craniotomy defect. Chronic changes of
brain injury are seen in the left hemisphere including
encephalomalacia and ex vacuo ventricular dilitation, with an
associated slight shift of normally midline structures to the
left, unchanged since the prior study. The fluid in the extra-
axial space under the craniotomy flap that was present on the
prior exam has resolved. No areas of intra- or extra- axial
acute hemorrhage are identified. There are no findings to
suggest major vascular territorial infarction. There are post-
surgical changes in the area of the craniotomy, the remaining
soft tissue structures including the orbits appear unremarkable.
----
LENIs [**10-31**]:Nonocclusive thrombus within the left common femoral,
greater saphenous, and mid superficial femoral veins.
----
Head CT [**10-31**]:: Limited study, due to severe image degradation
from beam- hardening and streak artifacts, as detailed above. No
displacement of the normally midline structures, or change in
the configuration of the ventricular system since the prior head
CT. Repeat head CT, without metallic devices, would obviously be
a more sensitive means to assess the brain parenchyma.
----
CTA [**10-31**]:IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral central pulmonary embolism involving bilateral main
pulmonary arteries, as well as bilateral upper and lower lobe
branches.
2. Associated mosaic perfusion of bilateral lungs.
3. Improving atelectasis.
----
Torso CT [**11-3**]:IMPRESSION:
1. Marked increase in airspace consolidation within the right
and left lungs as described above.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. No evidence of hematoma within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
.
US RUQ: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound. No son[**Name (NI) 493**]
evidence of acalculous cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.Neuro:
She was initially admitted to the neuro-stepdown unit to monitor
given her frequent focal motor facial seizures.  These initially
improved with a phenobarbital load and she appeared to be
improving.  Her phenobarbital level was good at 42 after her
load.  She was continued on her home AEDs.  Unfortunately, she
then began to have an increase in her facial seizures(6-8/hr)
without complete recovery in between.  She was unable to talk in
between seizures and then started to desat into the 80s despite
5LNC oxygen.  For this reason, she was intubated, transferred to
the ICU and put on a pentobarb drip.  This achieved burst
supression.  She was continued in this state for sev
