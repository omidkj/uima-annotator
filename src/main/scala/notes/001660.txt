HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
female, who was admitted on [**2129-6-6**], initially went to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after an episode of DKA.  On admission, she initially
noted 7 days of nausea, vomiting with some diarrhea, urinary
frequency, and fevers and chills times 2 days.  Of note, she
had a recent bilateral knee arthroscopy 11 days prior.
Initially, she had a white blood cell count 16.9, elevated
creatinine of 2.0, and an anion gap of 39 with a pH of 7.02
on ABG.  Initial infectious workup was unremarkable and the
patient was placed on an insulin drip until her anion gap
closed.  She subsequently was able to tolerate p.o. and was
placed on NPH regimen 40 units in the morning and 40 units at
night [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations as well as a Humalog sliding
scale.  Her course in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was notable for orthopedic
evaluation of the knees, who felt her knees were an unlikely
source of infection and no further imaging was needed.  She
had a recent radioactive iodine ablation of her thyroid and
thyroid function tests were done, which will be checked as an
outpatient.  During the hospital course, she did note some
vague abdominal discomfort, but was able to tolerate p.o.
with normal liver and pancreatic labs.

respirations 15 to 33, and saturating 99 percent on room air.
General appearance:  The patient is resting comfortably in no

moist.  Poor dentition.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac exam is regular rate and rhythm.  No
murmurs are noted.  Abdomen:  Good bowel sounds, tympanic,
and diffuse tenderness to palpation most notably over the
epigastric region.  No evidence of rebound tenderness.
Extremities have trace lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Clean incision sites on knees bilaterally.  No significant
swelling.  Neurological exam:  Grossly nonfocal.

normal BUN and creatinine of 13 and 0.6 with the glucose of
269.  Normal LFTs, normal alkaline phosphatase, normal
bilirubin, and normal amylase and lipase.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient appears to
present with an episode of DKA with an unclear precipitant.
After she tolerated p.o., she was placed on a stable NPH
regimen as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations and was transferred out
of the ICU.  She had stable glucose control throughout the
rest of her hospital stay and will follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as
an outpatient.

Abdominal pain.  The patient appears to have some chronic
abdominal pain of unclear etiology.  It was felt that she may
have a component of gastroparesis and was placed on Reglan.
She does have some reflux type symptoms.  She was placed on a
PPI b.i.d.  Ultrasound was unremarkable and labs did not
reveal any etiology for abdominal pain.  She did not have
significant improvement with medication changes during her
visit and she will follow up with Gastroenterology as an
outpatient.

Musculoskeletal.  She is on Vioxx and Darvocet p.r.n.
Orthopedics have evaluated her knees and felt that this was
unlikely source of an infection and unlikely to be the cause
of her DKA.  She will continue to follow up with the
Orthopedics as an outpatient.

Thyroid.  She was recently given reactive iodine and was
continued on methimazole.  Followup with Endocrine as an
outpatient.

FEN.  Her creatinine returned to [**Location 213**] after she was

vomiting, but was subsequently able to tolerate p.o. at the
time of discharge.
