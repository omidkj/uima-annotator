ECG Study Date of [**2106-11-1**]  1:51:44 PM

Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing the Q-T interval is
shorter.

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2106-11-1**] 3:22 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or edema.
2. Bilateral hilar prominence, recommend further evaluation with
chest CT to exclude hilar lymphadenopathy.

TEE (Complete) Done [**2106-11-2**] at 3:10:31 PM      FINAL
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
