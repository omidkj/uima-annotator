History of Present Illness:
86 F with Alzheimer's dementia who lives in a nursing home with
PMHx of htn and hyperlipidemia presented to [**Hospital3 1443**] ED
for vague symptoms documented to be shortness of breath and back
pain.  EKG was concerning for STEMI in the inferior leads and
her troponins were elevated to 1.35.  Her BP dropped to the 60's
and she was placed on dopamine 10 mg and fluids were not given
because of concerns for CHF.  She was given asa, plavix and
integrillin and transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cath.

LAD and 70% mid large aneurysm in Diag, mild Lcx disease.  BMS
was placed in the RCA.  RHC showed a mean wedge of 24.  She
remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the CCU
for further care.

On initial exam at [**Hospital1 18**] she thought she was visiting her father
in the morning and did not know where she is or her current
situation.  She denied any complaints including SOB or chest
pain.
.
ROS: She denied orthopnea, PND, peripheral edema, claudication,
LH, palpitations.  She denied fevers, chills, abd pain, n/v/d.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 F with Alzheimer's dementia who lives in a nursing home with
PMHx of htn and hyperlipidemia with inferior STEMI.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: Her initial EKG was concerning for right sided
STEMI given ST elevations in III>II and right sided V4 shows
STE. Cardiac cath was performed, showing a mid RCA 80% as the
likely culprit lesion.  She received a BMS to her RCA. Other
pertinent findings of her catheterization included a 90%
proximal LAD stenosis, an 70% mid vessel stenosis, and a large
aneurysm of the diagonal branch.  The LCx had mild luminal
irregularities.  Given the large aneurysm, no intervention was
done to the LAD.  She was given asa, plavix, bblocker, statin,
and ace-i. Her BBlocker was titrated for better control of her
HR.  She was transferred to the floor on [**2158-4-23**]. While there
she had no further evidence of ischemia, although she did have
an episode of hypotension (described below in "pump" section).
Cardiac enzymes were consistent with resolving past MI rather
than new event.
.
# Pump: Upon admission, she was in failure given mean wedge 24
and crackles 3/4 up on both lungs. Also, CI low at 2.0.  ECHO
showed moderately depressed overall left ventricular systolic
function (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the
inferior septum, inferior free wall, and posterior
(inferolateral) wall.  She also had mild pulm artery systolic
hypertension. She was diuresed and appeared initially to improve
clinically. On [**4-24**], she was helped out of bed by a physical
therapist and began to feel "woozy"; she had pressures in the
60s-70s systolic. She was bolused and then given additional
fluids for a total of approximately 500 cc NS, after having been
negative 800 cc from midnight to the morning after diuresis. Her
lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol were held during the day. They
were restarted at the doses given as discharge medications
(below) without further events.
.
# Rhythm: Sinus. No h/o dysrhythmias. She was monitored on
telemetry. She did have some relative tachycardia (heart rates
up to the 90s) for which we initially increased metoprolol to
12.5 TID, but after her episode of hypotension we changed this
back to [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
.
# Valves: On echocardiogram, she had aortic valve stenosis with
valve area 1.2-1.9.  It also showed mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+)
mitral regurgitation. Likely this combination of valve problems
has contributed significantly to her delicate fluid balance as
she is preload dependent but easily susceptible to fluid
overload.
.
# HTN: Held home valsartan.
-- Low dose beta-blocker and lisinopril, continuing home
furosemide
.
# Osteoporosis: she was maintained on vitamin D, calcium, and
Fosamax
.
# Prophylaxis: SQ heparin, bowel regimen
.
# Code: full

# Communication: daughter
