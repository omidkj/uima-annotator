IMAGING
.
HEAD AND NECK PET-CT [**9-15**]:
.
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
12.1 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2184-9-15**]);
***************** AMENDED REPORT *****************
.
INDICATION:68 year old male with history of stage III squamous
cell carcinoma presenting as a right oropharyngeal mass. He is
s/p radiation therapy and therapy with cetuximab.
 .
METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration
of F-18
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained
for attenuation correction and for fusion with emission PET
images. [The noncontrast CT images are not used to diagnose
disease independently of the PET images.] A series of
overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting
blood glucose level, measured by glucometer before injection of
FDG, was 139 mg/dL.
.
The area imaged spanned the region from the head to the thighs.
Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused
with emission PET images to assist with the anatomic
localization of tracer uptake. The determination of the site of
tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important implications
regarding the significance of that uptake.
.
INTERPRETATION:
Comparison is made to PET/CT of [**2184-4-29**].
.
HEAD/NECK: The right oropharyngeal mass extending from the
hypophyarynx to the cricoid cartilage seen in the PET/CT dated
[**2184-4-29**] is seen again. The FDG-avidity of the mass has
decreased since the last scan. The SUVmax today is 7.9 when
compared to 16.3 last time. The mass continues to extend past
the midline to the left. The craniocaudal extension is still
unclear. The left level IIb node seen on the prior study is no
longer seen and there is no new nodal involvement. There is low
level FDG-avidity of the muscles and soft tissue in the
posterior part of the neck and also in the base of the neck
which is most likely secondary to radiation therapy (Images
57-62). There is no abnormal FDG-avid focus in the head.
.
CHEST: There is no FDG-avid mediastinal, hilar or axillary
lymphadenopathy. The right upper lobe nodule described in the
last PET/CT is stable. There is a new ground glass opacity in
the periphery of the right upper lobe and may be secondary to
infection, follow up is recommended (Image 73). This is
non-FDG-avid. The 2 mm right middle lobe nodule is stable(Image
80). The left lower lobe opacity is seen again and continues to
be non-FDG-avid. It currently measures 10.4mm x 11.1mm.
.
ABDOMEN/PELVIS: There is no abnormal hepatic, splenic or adrenal
gland FDG
uptake. There is no FDG-avid abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy.
There is physiologic tracer accumulation in the gastrointestinal
and genitourinary  tracts. The focal FDG-avid lesion in the
redundant sigmoid colon is not seen today. The FDG-avidity seen
in the left scrotum has also resolved.The focal FDG uptake in
the right upper quadrant is also not seen today. Contrast is
seen in the kidney and the bowel.
.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:There are non-FDG-avid degenerative changes in
the thoracolumbar spine. There is no FDG-avid or destructive
bone lesion. The focal FDG-avid lesion described in the
iliopsoas tendon anterior to the neck of the left femur has
resolved though the hypodense CT correlate is persistent further
reinforcing an infective etiology.
.
Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary
glands, GI and GU tracts, liver and spleen.
.
IMPRESSION: 1. Interval decrease in FDG-avidity of the right
oropharyngeal mass. No new FDG-avid lymphadenopathy. The left
level II lymph node is not apparent anymore. 2. Stable right
upper lobe, right middle lobe nodules. Stable left lower lobe
opacity. Resolution of the focal FDG-avidity in the right lower
lobe. 3. Resolution of the FDG-avid focus in the sigmoid colon
and in the left  iliopsoas tendon.
.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**9-30**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild
mitral regurgitation.
.
CHEST X-RAY [**10-3**]
HISTORY: Throat cancer. Recent tracheostomy. Poor respiratory
status.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-2**], most recently 4:34
p.m.:
Volume loss in the left lower lobe has improved, revealing new
consolidation, probably pneumonia. Heart size is normal,
pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged, but there is no
pulmonary edema. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. No
mediastinal widening or pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
 [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:
68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted
for weakness and dehydration.
.
He was initially admitted to the oncology floor. However, he was
soon transferred from the oncology service to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU
(combined medical/surgical ICU, with medical team managing Mr.
[**Known lastname 28253**]) for hypoxia.
.
His course, primarily in the ICU, is summarized by issue:
.
# Hypoxia and respiratory failure, secondary to pneumonia:
He was originally admitted to the oncology service and there
became hypoxic. When the patient was on the floor, his ABG on
50% FiO2 was 7.51/30/65 when satting 92%.  Patient was
transferred to ICU on [**9-16**] for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
When patient arrived on [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was satting at 95-100% on 50%
FiO2.  This respiratory distress was most likely from right
middle lobe PNA seen on CXR, although he did have a high BNP and
heart failure may have contributed acutely. He had thick,
fluorescent green mucous in oropharynx which was foul smelling,
making pseudomonas possible.
.
MSSA grew out of his sputum on a sample from [**9-18**]. GNRs had been
seen on sputum gram stain from this same sample. Broad coverage
was continued.
