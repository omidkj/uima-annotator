Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
vertigo this morning

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cerebral angiography
intubation


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 70 year-old woman with a history of CAD,
hypothyroidism and depression who presents following an episode
of vertigo this morning.  Patient was intubated at the time of
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], so history was obtained from [**Location (un) **]
medical
records and the patient's son.  Reportedly at 7:30am the patient
reported sudden onset of severe vertigo accompanied by nausea
and
vomiting, to the extent that she was unable to stand or walk.
She called EMS, however they had to call the police department
to
get into the house, as the patient was so vertiginous she was
unable to even walk to the door to let them in.  She was taken
to
[**Hospital3 7569**], and apparently on evaluation there she was
initially reportedly 'neurologically intact' aside from a mild
nystagmus and gait instability.  She underwent a NCHCT which
showed evidence of prior infarcts, however no new hemorrhage or
infarct.  Arrangements were made to transport her to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation, and [**Location (un) **] arrived at 9:45am.  In the
process of obtaining signout and preparing her for transport,
they report that she acutely decompensated, developing left
facial droop, left arm and leg weakness, and dysarthria and
swallowing difficulties.  She was noted to be quite agitated,
flailing her arm and leg on the right side.  Given the acute
decline, the decision was made to intubate her, which was done
at
10:07am, and then she was immediately transferred to [**Hospital1 18**],
arriving at 10:49am.



Past Medical History:
- Hypothyroidism
- CAD s/p stenting,
- s/p CEA
- Depression
- Prior TIAs, which son describes as transient left sided
weakness that resolved.


Social History:
unknown

Family History:
unknown

Physical Exam:
P: 40 R: 16  BP: 160/80 SaO2: 100% intubated
General: Intubated, sedated, not following commands.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated. No nuchal rigidity
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W
Cardiac: RRR, nl. S1S2, no M/R/G noted
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or
organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP pulses
bilaterally.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic (performed off sedation, ~1 hour after patient
received fentanyl, versed and succinylcholine for intubation)

-Mental Status: Not responsive to verbal or painful stimuli

-Cranial Nerves: Pupils 2mm and minimally reactive.  Sluggish
corneals, negative oculocephalics.  Intact gag.

-Motor/Sensory: Flaccid paralysis throughout.  Triple flexion
vs.
withdrawal on the right leg to painful, stimuli, otherwise no
response in other limbs.

Plantar response was extensor on the right, mute on the left.



Pertinent Results:
[**2106-1-15**] EEG This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of
a slow
background, reaching a maximum of 6 Hz. This represents a
moderate
encephalopathy. It is also abnormal due to the presence of L>R
hemisphere bursts of delta slowing, suggesting additional focal
subcortical dysfunction, though the tracing cannot specify the
etiology.
There were no electrographic seizures in the recording.

[**2106-1-11**] MRI/A 1. Multiple acute/subacute infarcts, both in the
supra- and infratentorial compartments as described above.
2. Lack of flow related enhancement in the right vertebral and
the right
posterior cerebral artery, are consistent with occlusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU service after tPA was given and
it was determined that she was not a candidate for intervention
due to b/l vertebral artery occlusion. She was intubated and
during hospital course she became less responsive and stopped
moving her extremities or withdrawing to painful stimuli. EEG
was consistent with encephalopathy, but no evidence of seizures.
Discussion with family memebers revealed that she would not want
to live like this and the decision wa smade with her son to not
trach/PEG and to make her comfort measures only.

Patient was extubated with family present and died within 24
hours.
