HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old man with a
past medical history significant for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
currently in remission since [**2146**] after chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, and surgical resection, who was in his
usual state of health until the morning of admission when he
woke up feeling fatigued.  Patient states he grew
increasingly short of breath with walking around at around 11
in the morning; he got out of his car at 12:45 pm and walked
up some stairs, whereupon he became even more short of
breath, lightheaded, and dizzy.  His friends took him to the
fire department, and from there, he was taken to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital.

At that hospital, he was found to be tachycardic at 114-132,
hypertensive with a blood pressure of 150/90, and with low O2
sats that were not recorded.  On 100% nonrebreather, he was
sating 100%, and was eventually dropped to 2 liters nasal
cannula where he was sating 94%.  No arterial blood gas was
drawn at the outside hospital.  An electrocardiogram was
done, but not sent with records.  His chest x-ray was
negative for any findings.  A CT scan of the chest was done
at the outside hospital which revealed bilateral massive
pulmonary emboli.  A CT scan of the brain was obtained which
was negative.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

He is a [**Hospital3 328**] Cancer Institute/[**Hospital1 20954**] Hospital
patient, but [**Hospital1 20954**] Hospital is on diversion, so he
was sent here instead.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in [**2142**] after he
presented with right neck swelling.  He had a lymph node and
parotid biopsy on the right side which showed follicular
small cell cleaved lymphoma.  He also had a right tibial
biopsy during workup of a tibial mass which showed
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of a large cell diffuse type.  He is
status post chemotherapy with chlorambucil between [**2142**] and
[**2144**], he is status post chemotherapy with CHOP x6, status
post XRT to the right tibia with recurrence in [**2147-1-23**].
He is status post parotid gland removal with recurrence of
right neck non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2145**].  He then underwent
more XRT and CHOP, and he eventually underwent an autologous
stem cell transplant in [**2147-4-25**] that was complicated by
febrile neutropenia.  He had tumor excision from his right
tibia in [**2147-2-23**].
2. Knee surgeries:  Arthroscopic meniscus repair in [**2146**],
total knee replacement on the right in [**2150-4-25**]
complicated by infection requiring washout and plastic
surgery as well as chronic antibiotic therapy for positive
cultures, coag-neg Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella.
3. Nonmalignant tumor removed from chest at age 19.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Occasional cigars x32 years.  Drinks 3-4
beers a day.  Retired delivery driver.  Lives in Winton with
his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has eight children and 14 grandchildren.

FAMILY HISTORY:  [**Name (NI) **] father died at the age of 52 of a
myocardial infarction.  [**Name (NI) **] mother died of old age in
her 80s.  Patient has a brother who died of cancer when he
was 41.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for occasional chest pain
lasting 15-30 seconds over the past 4-5 months.  Positive for
knee pain which is chronic.  Positive for muscle tightness in
his calf.  Positive for nausea, but no vomiting.  Positive
for diarrhea, which he attributes to antibiotics.  His review
of systems is negative for angina on exertion, calf pain, or
tenderness, fever, chills, cough, or hemoptysis, diaphoresis,
night sweats, chills, decreased appetite, or weight loss.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Rifampin 300 mg po bid.
2. Levaquin 250-500 mg po q day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.0, heart
rate 97, blood pressure 120/66, respiratory rate 19, sating
99% on 2.5 liters.  His physical examination was remarkable
for a right cheek and right neck surgical scar, no jugular
venous distention, clear lungs, a tachycardic heart that was
regular in rhythm, but had distant heart sounds, but no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops, a guaiac negative rectal
examination, and an extremity examination which revealed a
warm right lower extremity that was slightly swollen, but had
no cords, [**Last Name (un) 5813**] sign or excessive tenderness.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Complete blood count
revealed a white count of 9.8 with a normal differential.
His hematocrit was 42.1, platelets were 153.  Coagulation
profile revealed a PT of 12.8, PTT of 19.4, and an INR of
1.1.  The patient's Chem-7 revealed normal electrolytes and a
creatinine of 1.2.

Chest x-ray as mentioned earlier was negative.  CT scan of
the chest as mentioned earlier showed bilateral pulmonary
emboli and no hilar masses, lymphadenopathy, or effusions.

An electrocardiogram was obtained in the hospital which
revealed sinus tachycardia at 100, normal axis, and normal
intervals with no ischemic changes, and a S1 and an inverted
T wave in III.

ASSESSMENT:  This 67-year-old man with a history of a
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and knee surgery, who complains of
shortness of breath x1 day and has been diagnosed with
bilateral pulmonary emboli at an outside hospital, and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
potential lytic therapy.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Pulmonary.  The patient was diagnosed with bilateral
pulmonary emboli from a CT scan.  He was maintained on
supplemental O2, from which he was eventually weaned.  He was
continued on the Heparin drip, which he had been started on
at the outside hospital, in order to keep his PTT therapeutic
at 60-80 seconds.  The decision was made not to perform lytic
therapy on the patient, as he was hemodynamically stable.  He
was started on Coumadin on hospital day #2.  Because by the
time of discharge, the patient's INR had not been
therapeutic, the decision was made to send the patient home
on Lovenox therapy until his INR is therapeutic.  His Heparin
drip was discontinued 2-3 hours after starting Lovenox
therapy.

2. Cardiovascular.  The patient has a family history of
coronary artery disease, is a smoker, and is over 55, all of
which were risk factors for developing coronary artery
disease and being at risk for an ischemic or infarct event.
Given his prior history of chest pain in the past, the
patient was tested for infarct or ischemia with serial
electrocardiograms and cardiac enzymes.  He was maintained on
Telemetry.

His second set of enzymes revealed a troponin of 4, but this
is likely that this was secondary to heart strain from the
pulmonary emboli.  His CK and CK MB remained flat.  The
patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram for
assessment of hemodynamic stability as well as free wall
motion abnormalities that may indicate a cardiac event.  His
cardiac echocardiogram was normal and revealed an ejection
fraction of about 55% or more.

3. Hematology/Oncology.  Given the patient's diagnosis of
pulmonary emboli, the differential diagnosis behind the cause
of this included former knee surgery which could predispose
hypercoagulation, a coagulation disorder which is highly
unlikely, and a recurrent malignancy.  The patient had lower
extremity Dopplers which revealed active clot in the
superficial femoral and the common femoral vein.  He was
treated for these deep venous thromboses with Heparin and
eventually further coagulation with Coumadin and Lovenox.
The patient's stools were guaiacked while he was here and
remained guaiac negative.  His hematocrit remained stable
throughout his hospital stay.

The decision was made to contact the patient's oncologist,
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2405**] at [**Hospital1 20954**] Hospital [**Hospital3 328**] Cancer
Institute.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2405**] agreed that the patient needed
further followup.  There was no indication of current
malignancy either on CT examination or laboratory studies.

4. Infectious Disease.  The patient has a history of right
knee coag-neg Staph and Klebsiella since [**Month (only) **],
