Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
woman with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes
mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who
presented to an outside hospital complaining of mid-sternal
pressure like chest pain which he rated 7 out of 10 in
severity.  The patient states she had chest pain the night
prior but it went away and she thought it was just gas.  She
awoke this morning with the same chest pain.  She says that
the pain radiates to both arms causing tingling.  She also
has nausea but no vomiting, no diaphoresis, and no increase
in her normal shortness of breath.

The patient denies similar chest pain in the recent past.
She has no orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, but she
states that in the last month she had been having some lower
extremity edema.  The patient has a questionable history of
congestive heart failure and says in the past she was
hospitalized approximately eight years ago with shortness of
breath and some chest pain, and was told that she has
congestive heart failure.

The patient was admitted to the outside hospital and had ST
elevations in leads V2 through V4.  She was started on
sublingual Nitroglycerin times two, heparin, aspirin, a
Nitroglycerin drip, with a resolution of her chest pain.  Her
first CPK was 65, troponin 0.454.  The patient was
mediflighted to [**Hospital1 69**] for
emergent catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from chronic
bronchitis.  She is O2 dependent on two liters nasal cannula
at home.
2.  Diverticulitis.
3.  Colon abscess, status post colectomy and colostomy in
[**2105**].
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  Congestive heart failure.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Digoxin 0.125 mg q. day.
2.  Klonopin 0.5 mg q. day.
3.  Zestril 5 mg q. day.
4.  Atrovent nebulizer.
5.  Albuterol nebulizer.
6.  Lasix 40 mg q. day.
7.  Zantac 150 mg twice a day.
8.  Actimol 5 mg q. day.
9.  NPH 40/20 regimen and takes regular insulin 2 and 2.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Distant smoking history.  She quit over 50
years ago.  No alcohol.  Lives in a senior home.  Has a home
health aide three times a week and a visiting nurse one time
a week.  She says she is able to cook for herself and perform
some activities of daily living.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

The patient went to cardiac catheterization.  Hemodynamics
revealed a wedge pressure of 27, RA-pressure of 15, a
pulmonary artery pressure of 43/25 with a mean of 32 and a
right ventricle pressure of 43/17.  Left main showed distal
20% blocking.  Left anterior descending showed proximal 80%
tubular stenosis, 30 to 40% mid-tubular stenosis and mild
diffuse disease distally.  The left circumflex supplies a
large distal obtuse marginal; luminal irregularities
throughout.  Ramus was small caliber but tubular subtotal
occlusion was present proximally with slow flow.  The right
coronary artery had ulcerated proximal 40% stenosis and
diffuse mild disease.

INTERVENTIONS:  The proximal left anterior descending was
dilated and stented with residual 10% stenosis.  The ramus
lesion was dilated with some improvement in flow, however,
the decision was made to not attempt a stent as it is
unlikely to be the culprit vessel.  The patient was started
on Lasix, Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and came to the floor
still on the Nitroglycerin drip.

On admission, her temperature was 97.0 F.; blood pressure
111/81; pulse 95 with normal sinus rhythm and occasional
premature ventricular contractions.  Respiratory rate 18;
pulse oximetry 99% on two liters.  PA-pressure was 43/21.
She was a pale, elderly woman in no acute distress.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  Poor dentition.  No jugular venous
pressure was present or carotid bruit.  Distant heart sounds;
regular rate; S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs had
bibasilar crackles and positive for expiratory wheezing.  She
had positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.
Colostomy bag was in her left lower quadrant.  The patient
had trace edema, good radial pulses and dorsalis pedis
pulses.  The femoral sheath site was in the right femoral
vein and was not bleeding and no bruit was present.  Skin was
dry and warm, and the peripheral was warm.  Neurologically,
the patient was shaky but says she is shaky at baseline.
Otherwise, neurologically, she was grossly intact.

At the outside hospital, the patient had a hematocrit of
31.9.  Her sodium was 138/4.0, 99/34, 14/0.9, 188.  Calcium
7.9, albumin 2.8.  LDH was 725, alkaline phosphatase 59,
LT/OT was 43/30.

Her first CPK was 65 and troponin I was 0.45.  The subsequent
CPK on admission was 1519 with MB of 168, and with an index
of 11.1.

Her labs at [**Hospital1 69**] at 01:00
p.m. showed a white blood cell count of 15.6, hemoglobin and
hematocrit of 8.8/25.9 and platelets of 162.

Old EKG on [**2109-7-17**], showed 94 beats per minute, normal
sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.  No axis
deviation.  On [**2109-8-7**] at 09:00 a.m., normal sinus rhythm,
[**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V2 through V6, Q in V1 and V2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Systematically:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has coronary artery disease
with two vessel disease seen on catheterization status post
stenting of her proximal left anterior descending, so she was
continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Integrilin for 18 hours.
Beta blockers were initially withheld secondary to chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease but were started the following
morning, attempted trial first with a 5 mg push which was
tolerated.  The patient did not have any respiratory issues.
She was then titrated up on a p.o. dose initially at 12.5 mg
of Lopressor twice a day.

The patient had no further chest pain during the hospital
course.  Her CPKs peaked on the night of the 24th at 1519 and
an MB of 168, and the next morning it had dropped off to
1023, and an MB of 50.  Lipid panel was sent out and revealed
a triglyceride of 210, HDL of 47, LDL of 99.  The patient
will likely be started on a statin in the near future.

Pump - the patient had elevated PA pressure and capillary
wedge pressures and was diuresed with Lasix.  Her O2
saturation improved as she diuresed throughout the hospital
course.  An echocardiogram was done the following day which
showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 35%.  Conclusions were
left atrium is normal size, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size, moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the
distal half of the septum, anterior wall and distal lateral
inferior walls.  The apex is also akinetic, but not
aneurysmal and no discrete left ventricular thrombus is seen.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motions are
normal.  The patient has no aortic regurgitation, no
significant aortic stenosis, one plus mitral regurgitation
and an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure normal.

IMPRESSION:  Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
extensive regional systolic dysfunction consistent with
coronary artery disease, a mid left anterior descending that
wraps around the apex, mild mitral regurgitation.

Rate and rhythm:  The patient had an elevated rate on the
night of admission.  She was sedated and given some Diltiazem
20 mg intravenous push with some resolution of her
tachycardia.  Overnight, she had an episode of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation.  She was continually monitored during
the hospital course.  She was started on beta blocker the
next morning and had good rate control.  If the patient
continues to have episodes of atrial fibrillation, the
patient may require long-term anti-coagulation.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient has known chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and was started back on her Atrovent and
Albuterol nebulizers and daily dose of Prednisone 10 mg.  She
was initially quite wheezy on admission but after nebulizers
improved.  Her lungs sounded quite wet on admission to the
floor, but after diuresing also improved.  At time of
discharge, she is likely close to her baseline
