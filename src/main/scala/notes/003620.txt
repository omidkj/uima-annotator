Cefazolin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8404**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal jugular central venous catheter insertion

History of Present Illness:
77 year old male with a history of known 5 cm AAA and
penetrating thoracic aortic ulcerations, CHF with EF 30-35%, DM,
ESRD on HD(MWF) via LUE AV fistula, carotid disease, chronic
dyspnea on 3LNC, previous MSSA bacteremia presents from dialysis
with hypotension.  Pt here from dialysis after full run with c/o
bright red blood from rectum on toilet paper. Denies abd pain,
CP, SOB, lightheadedness, or dizziness in dialysis. Of note,
patient admitted from [**Date range (1) 29411**] for similar presenation after
dialysis. He had a CT scan at that point which ruled out AAA
rupture. He was initially on dopamine but once it was determined
that thigh BPs were higher than arms, he was quickly weaned off.
It was ultimately thought that BPs low from intravascular
depletion after dialysis. He had an episode of somnolent and
delirium after receiving ativan. During this admission he was
also intubated on admission after reaction while getting blood
and Vancomycin while hypertensive so thought to have flash pulm
edema. This resolved quickly. He was guaic positive previously.
.
In the ED initial vitals were: 96.8 72 97/68 20 93% 3L.
Triggered for BPs to 70s -> bolus. Prior to transfer, 98.6, HR
74 paced, 103/67, 16 100% 3l n/c. V-Paced, [**Doctor Last Name **] to prior. Brwn
stool, guaiac positive. CBC- hct stable. Pt SBPs 90s, int then
dropped to 70s, trigger x3 but asymptomatic. Cautious IVF->500cc
fluids x2. Asictes thought [**1-14**] CHF in past. RIJ placed in ED for
levofed on 0.01 BPs now 96/65 77. Mentating ok. Doesn't urinate
a lot.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was asking for food but was
otherwise without complaints. His SBPs in thighs showed SBPs in
200s and levofed was immediately shut off. There was noticeable
difference in upper ext BPs by 100mmHG lower which had been
reported previously. He reported not feeling well in the months
prior but no recent changes in symptoms since recent hospital
discharge. Reports having occasional episodes of spots bright
red blood in toilet but no profuse bleeding. Denied CP, SOB,
cough, fever, dizziness, N/V/D but did endorse abdomen more
distended.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
or constipation. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old male with a 5 cm AAA and penetrating thoracic aortic
ulcerations, CHF with EF 30-35%, DM, ESRD on HD(MWF) via LUE AV
fistula, carotid disease, chronic dyspnea on 3LNC, previous MSSA
bacteremia presents from dialysis with hypotension.
.
#. Hypotension/hypertension: The patient was initially thought
to be hypotensive, with blood pressures in his right arm as low
as the 70s. He was never symptomatic. In the emergency
department, he was treated with IV fluids. Additoinally, a
central venous catheter was placed in the ED, norepinephrine,
and the patient was transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, prior records were reviewed, including the
partially-completed discharge summary from the patient's
[**Date range (1) 29412**] admission for asymptomatic hypotension after
dialysis. During this prior admission, it was determined that
the blood pressures in his right upper extremity were
significantly different (by 100 points) from his right thigh
pressures, and it was recommended that blood pressures be
checked in the patient's thigh. Based on this information, the
patient's right thigh pressure was checked and was found to be
in the 200s. Norepinephrine was shut off, with improvement in
the patient's right thigh pressure to the 160s. As before, the
patient had a significant difference between his his right arm
and thigh blood pressures. Antihypertensives were initially
held, but the right thigh blood pressure rose to the 230s during
ultrafiltration on [**2201-5-17**]. Lisinopril and metoprolol were
restarted, with improvement in the patient's right blood
pressure to the 160s. The patient was never symptomatic.
.
Consideration was given to whether the patient's arm-thigh blood
pressure difference might be a sign of acute aortic pathology.
The same concern was raised during the patient's [**Date range (1) 29411**]
admission, during which CT angiography of the chest from showed
extensive but stable aortic atherosclerotic disease, and CTA of
the abdomen and pelvis showing the patient's known abdominal
aortic aneurysm without evidence of leak or rupture.
.
The patient's arm-thigh blood pressure difference was discussed
with the vascular team who cared for the patient during his
prior admission. They concluded that it was very difficult to
determine the patient's true aortic blood pressure, which was
probably somewhere in between the blood pressures that were
being measured in the patient's arm and thigh. They thought the
patient's arm pressure was probably more accurate, but that it
might not be completely accurate given the patient's extensive
periphe
