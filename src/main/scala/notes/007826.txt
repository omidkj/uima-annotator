Reports-
CXR
FINDINGS: Portable upright AP chest radiograph is obtained. A
left IJ
dialysis catheter is seen with the tip in the expected location
of the
cavoatrial junction. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
again noted.
Increased opacity at the right lung base is concerning for
pneumonia. Scarring in the upper lungs is again noted and has
been previously assessed on multiple prior CT scans. The heart
is enlarged. Central pulmonary vessels appear slightly
prominent, which may be secondary to mild fluid overload. No
pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures
appear grossly intact.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, suggestion of mild congestion. Opacity
at the right lung base concerning for pneumonia.

Echo
The left atrium is elongated. A right-to-left shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest (by bubble study); cannot
distinguish between a patent foramen ovale vs an atrial septal
defect on the basis of this study. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully
coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2185-9-5**], right-to-left shunting is now identified at
the atrial level.

MRV-
IMPRESSION:

1. Occlusion of the righ internal jugular vein.
2. Moderate stenosis of the right subclavian vein.
3. Moderate stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein near the
confluence
with SVC.
4. Small amount of adherent fibrin around the portion of the
left IJ venous catheter within the SVC. Otherwise the SVC
grossly patent.
5. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
6. Known interstitial disease not well evaluated by MR.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 y.o. F with hx of sarcoid, ESRD, HTN, admitted with SOB with
hypoxia in setting of fever concerning for PNA.

1. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to decresed RV function and
worsening lung disease at baseline as well as contribution of
volume overload given history of not being able to complete full
HD sessions in the last few weeks.  Pt was intially on BiPAP
which was rapidly converted to her baseline 3 L NC.  Albuterol
and ipratropium nebs RTC.  Treated patient with vancomycin and
levofloxacin for pnemonia.  Pt received HD while in the
hospital.  She was discharged to complete 8 day course of
vancomycin and levofloxacin.

2. Sepsis: On admission, the patient had high fever and elevated
lactate of 2.9 with likely pneumonia on CXR in the RLL.
Cultures sent and NGTD.  Pt will continue vancomycin and
levofloxacin to complete 8 day course. Vancomycin via HD
protocol.

3. Melena: During HD session in ICU, pt became tachypnic,
tachycardic and hypertensive.  She was initially treated with
nebs and CXR did not show a change from prior.  She then had a
large bowel movement; this was melena.  Femoral line was placed
at bedside.  GI was consulted.  IV PPI gtt was initiated and
later changed to po PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI did not decide to pursue
endoscopy as this was likely due to known AVMs.  Instead, hct
was monitored.  1 pRBC was transfused during hospitalization
with some resolution of her tachycard
