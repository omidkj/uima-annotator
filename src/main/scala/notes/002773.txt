HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 86-year-old female
with a history of congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes,
complicated by end stage renal disease and hypertension who
presented with acute onset of dyspnea.  Patient reported
being in her usual state of health until the morning of
admission, when she awoke with severe dyspnea and
diaphoresis.  She informed her niece who telephoned EMS.  Per
EMS reports, the patient was found in profound respiratory
distress, diaphoretic with pale and cool skin.  EMS also
noted jugular venous distention to her jaw, wheezing and
bibasilar rales half way up her lungs.  Pulse of 95.  Blood
pressure of 220/100.  Respiratory rate of 36 and oxygen
saturation of 90%.  Later, 100% on nonrebreather mask.  She
was placed on a high flow of oxygen and given 0.04 mg of
sublingual nitroglycerin, ten times over the course of her
stay and with EMS and 100 mg of Lasix.  Her blood pressure
improved to 164/doppler.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reported worsening lower
extremity edema and orthopnea over the past two
months,resulting in the need for two pillows and sleep at
times in a chair.  Patient denied any cardiac symptoms
including angina, palpitations, lightheadedness, any cold
symptoms including fever, headaches, shakes, chills and
urinary symptoms including frequency, dysuria discharge and
any gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, emesis.

PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure.  Diagnosed of congestive heart
failure with echocardiogram in [**2172-8-3**] showing an
ejection fraction of greater than 60%.
2.  Type 2 diabetes, complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy,
and peripheral neuropathy.
3.  Diverticulosis with multiple episodes of lower
gastrointestinal bleeding.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Polymyalgia rheumatica.
6.  Urinary frequency with hematuria and proteinuria.
7.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy in [**2134**] for
fibroids.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Allopurinol 100 mg q.d.
2.  Norvasc 10 mg q.d.
3.  Atenolol 100 mg q.d.
4.  Lasix 60 mg b.i.d.
5.  Insulin NPH 10 units subcutaneous q.a.m.
6.  Tylenol 1-2 tablets q. 6 hours prn.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her niece.  She is widowed
with five children.  Uses a walker for ambulation.  She
smokes 20-30 pack years and quit four years ago.  No alcohol
use.  She has a history of blood transfusions, the first one
being in [**2134**] during her total abdominal hysterectomy.  Her
mother had coronary artery disease and diabetes.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the Emergency Department,
her vitals were:  Blood pressure of 180/doppler.  Heart rate
of 90.  Respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturation of 90%
on nonrebreather mask.  The patient was oriented times three,
bilateral diffuse crackles were found on lung exam,
nitroglycerin was titrated to 100 mcg/hour.  She was also
given Lasix 100 mg intravenously, morphine 2 mg intravenous
and aspirin 60 mg.  She was placed on BiPAP.  The patient
eventually demonstrated subjective improvement in breathing
with respiratory rate coming down to the 20s.  There was no
urine output to an additional 100 mg of Lasix intravenously.
Her arterial blood gases were 7.26, 37 and 351.  Natrecor was
started with a 2 mg/kg bolus followed by a drip at 0.01
mcg/kg/minute.  She was given Diuril 50 mg intravenous for
urine output of only 200 cc.

MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  Due to the patient's
continued poor respiratory status, she was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit with a temperature of 96.6.
Heart rate of 74.  Blood pressure of 132/58.  Respiratory
rate of 19 and saturation of 92% on BiPAP.  Her exam was
notable for jugular venous distention up to the jaw, [**4-8**]
holosystolic ejection murmur, heard diffusely over her
precordium, bibasilar crackles half way up her lungs with
anterior wheezing and 3+ pitting edema in her lower
extremities.

LABORATORIES:  Her laboratories are notable only for a BUN of
68 and a creatinine of 6.8, phosphate of 6.7 and a PTH of
1448.  Chest x-ray revealed alveolar edema.  Abdominal CT,
which was taken for concern of retroperitoneal bleed causing
a low hematocrit was unconcerning.  The electrocardiogram
revealed no changes from the previous electrocardiogram and
the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.

The patient underwent Dialysis twice over the weekend via the
left femoral for her volume overload.  Her edema and
respiratory distress resolved allowing the discontinuation of
BiPAP and she was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition on the following po medications:
Aspirin 81 mg q.d., hydralazine 30 mg q. 6 hours, isosorbide
dinitrate 10 mg t.i.d., Toprol 100 mg q.d., and Sevelamer 800
mg t.i.d.  She was also placed on an insulin sliding scale,
pneumonic boots and subcutaneous heparin.

COURSE ON THE WARDS:  In summary, we accepted an 86-year-old
female with a history of congestive heart failure, type 2
diabetes, complicated by end stage renal disease and
hypertension who presented with acute or subacute dyspnea due
to pulmonary edema secondary to either acute ischemic event
or subacute worsening of renal failure.  The patient's vitals
on acceptance were a temperature of 98, a heart rate of 88,
blood pressure of 160/99, respiratory rate of 24 and an
oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Her exam was notable
only for her 3/6 systolic murmur and scattered
bibasilar crackles on lung exam.  On Monday, the patient
refused a pharmacological stress test.  She was, however,
followed by the Heart Failure Team and educated regarding
diet modification compliance and the signs and symptoms of
congestive heart failure.  The patient underwent Dialysis on
Tuesday, the 22nd, and Thursday, without complications.  On
Wednesday, a Permacath was placed in her right internal
jugular while an AV fistula was done in her left arm, both by
Transplant Surgery.  Lisinopril was instituted in place of
hydralazine with good effect.

At the time of discharge, the patient's blood pressure was
138/60.  Heart Failure Team has given instructions not to
lower her systolic blood pressure below the 130s for now to
give her system time to adapt.  Of note, is an eye infection
that developed on Tuesday, for which the patient was given
tobramycin drops.  The patient was discharged to
rehabilitation in good condition with instructions to
continue hemodialysis regimen.  A follow-up appointment has
been arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2067**] of the Heart Failure Clinic.
