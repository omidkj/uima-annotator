Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP attempted, unable to cannulate major papilla


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 yo male with a history of CAD s/p CABG, CHF
s/p ICD placement, afib on coumadin, chronic alcoholic
pancreatitis, and s/p whipple procedure (Puestow procedure) who
presents with fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal
pain. Reports that he had non-radiating periumbilical abdominal
pain that started 4 days PTA and was associated with nausea.
Pain was dissimilar from prior pancreatitis or SBO pain or other
pain he has had in past. Pain resolved by the following day. On
day PTA, pain recurred and was more severe and associated with
N/V/D, fevers, and chills. Denies melena, hematochezia, LH,
dizziness, chest pain, SOB, cough. Emesis was dry heaves,
non-bloody. He initially presented to an OSH where due to
eleavted LFTs and bilirubin,  RUQ ultrasound was performed and
was reportedly unremarkable.  He was given a dose of zosyn and
transferred for possible ERCP. Of note, he reports ETOH intake
on Tues and Thursday of this week. Also c/o pruritus which is
stable from baseline.

In the ED, initial vs were: pain 8, T 97.5, HR 90, BP 110/80, RR
16, O2 sat 93%.  Patient was repeatedly hypotensive with SBPs
70s-80s and required multiple 250cc boluses of IVF which were
given gently due to history of CHF.  Right IJ CVL was placed.
Labs were notable for WBC count 22.4K with 5 bands, K 3.2,
creatinine 1.1 (up from 0.7), ALT 95, AST 112, Tbili 3.9, INR
3.4, lactate 2.2, and a positive UA.  CT abdomen and pelvis with
contrast showed no acute pathology.  He was evaluated by surgery
and ERCP team.  He received vancomycin 1g IV, dilaudid 1 mg IV,
and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV.  Vital signs on sign-out were T
97.6, HR 83, BP 107/66, RR 16, O2 sat 95% on RA with improvement
in abdominal pain.

On arrival to the ICU, he reported abdominal pain was much
improved compared with yesterday, currently [**2-16**]. Denies nausea
but reports his usual back pain is more severe due to bed
positioning.

On arrival to the floor, he reported his abdominal pain to be
resolved. He also denied nausea and vomitting.

CT ABD/PELVIS W/CONTRAST10/16:
1. Prior Puestow procedure with minimal surrounding stranding,
nonspecific.
2. Decrease in size of cystic lesions in the region of the
proximal pancreas are likely residual pseudocysts.
3. Lymphadenopathy, as above.
4. Progression of lower lumbar spine degenerative changes, as
above.

CXR [**10-21**] IMPRESSION:
Broken sternal wires. Small bilateral pleural effusions and
underyling
collapse/consolidation. Mild assymetric upper zone
redistribution.

ERCP [**10-23**] Impression: Cannulation of suspected minor papilla
superficially with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.

Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification
of thin, irregular pancreatic duct.
Due to altered anatomy, redundant folds and edema, the major
papilla was unable to be located for cannulation.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations: Return to floor
Continue with current antibiotic therapy for [**10-19**] day course
Consider pancreatic protocol CT scan to further delineate the
pancreatic/biliary anatomy as patient is unable to get MRCP due
to defibrillator.
Pending resolution of current inflammation, would consider
repeat ERCP in [**1-8**] weeks if clinically indicated.
