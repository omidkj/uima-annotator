Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for cardiac catheterization s/p VT arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76M with history of CAD s/p CABG ([**2106**] at [**Hospital1 18**]
LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PDA), EF of 30%, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, [**Hospital 2182**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.
Recently he reports having worsening shortness of breath and
chest discomfort. A stress echocardiogram (per report) was
performed and was abnormal (per one report severe hypokinesis of
LV w/ EF of 25-35%). He was scheduled for elective
catheterization at [**Hospital **] Hospital yesterday. In the
cardiovascular suite prior to cath on [**5-3**] he became
unresponsive, unclear if lost pulse. The rhythm on tele showed
Polymorophic VT c/w Torsades. He was electrically cardioverted
x4, no compressions, and successfully converted to sinus. He was
then admitted to the ICU. He was treated briefly with amiodarone
gtt (stopped due to bradycardia) and levophed gtt. He was
started on a heparin gtt. Labs at the time notable for K+ of 2.9
and Mg of 2.4.  Other labs WBC 14.3, HCT 40.4, PLT 313, CR 0.9,
Ck 1400, CK MB 7.3, Troponin-I 6.27-->7.72-->9.98. He had an
uneventful course overnight and was transferred this morning for
cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**]. Vitals at transfer were
afebrile 104/74  40-60s (PR prolongation) 18  97%2L
.
He was taken to cardiac catheterization here where noted to have
90% stenosis at LIMA to LAD anastamosis for which he received 1
DES, stenosis at Left Main to LCX that before could be
intervened. Transferred to CCU post-catheterization where he
denies chest pain, shortnes of breath, or complaint of any kind.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC CATH [**2119-5-4**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated native three-vessel disease. The LMCA had a distal
80%
lesion that extended into the LCx. The LAD had an extensive 80%
stenosis
extending from the proximal to mid-vessel. The LCx had a
proximal 80%
stenosis and occluded first and second obtuse marginal branches.
The RCA
was occluded proximally and collateralized via the LIMA-LAD.
2. Graft angiography demonstrated an occluded SVG-OM and
SVG-RCA. The
LIMA-LAD had a 90% anastomotic stenosis.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right-sided filling
pressures
and elevated left-sided filling pressures, with a PCWP of 19 mm
Hg.
There was no pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension. The
cardiac index
was preserved at 1.8 L/min/m2. There was mild systemic arterial
hypertension, with an SBP of 143 mm Hg. There was no gradient
upon
pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LIMA-LAD anastamosis with
a 2.5 x
12mm Promus drug eluting stent which was postdilated to 2.5mm.
Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically
apparent
dissection, and TIMI 3 flow. (see PTCA comments for details)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Occluded SVG-RCA and SVG-OM. LIMA-LAD anastomotic stenosis.
3. Elevated left-sided filling pressures.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LIMA-LAD anastamosis.
.
ECHO ([**2119-5-5**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with inferior and septal hypo- to akinesis. There is mild
hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 30-35%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional and global left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, most c/w multivessel CAD. Mild calcific
aortic stenosis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

to OM, SVG to PDA), EF 30-35%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: He was admitted to the CCU following
cardiac catherization. He was continued on aspirin, plavix,
atorvastatin and beta blocker.
On hospital day 1, he developed chest pain consistent with prior
angina. EKG showed rate related ventricular conduction delay
with repolarization abnormalties that resolved with better rate
control. Chest pain resolved improved with SLNG and resolved
with maalox. He remained chest pain free for the remainder of
the hospitalization. Plan is to return to [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab to fix
circumflex lesion in native circulation as an outpatient. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4455**] has been asked to coordinate this with [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiology
intake nurses at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22225**]. pt was told to stop lansoprazole
and take Ranitidine instead.
.
# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA ARREST: The polymorphic VT c/w
Torsades at the outside hospital was thought to be due to
metabolic abnormalities, notably hypokalemia, and possibly
cardiac ischemia.  There did not appear to be
