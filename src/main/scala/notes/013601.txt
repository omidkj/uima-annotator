History of Present Illness:
54 year-old man with a history of CHF (LVEF 25%), DM1 s/p
panc/kidney transplant, CAD s/p CABG was recently hospitalized
for DOE thought [**1-10**] to a RLL PNA, CHF, and possible amiodarone
toxicity, he was discharged on [**4-16**] to rehab with a 3L oxygen
requirement.  He refused to go to rehab so went home instead but
ended up back in the ER and was eventually sent to rehab at
[**Hospital1 **].  Per his wife, he has been going down-[**Doctor Last Name **] ever since
he entered rehab where they continued to fluid-restrict and
diurese him to the point of him feeling very dehydrated.  He did
not have any fevers as far as she knows.  He complained of SOB
at the nursing home today and was found to be hypoxic to the 80s
on RA, and satting 90% on 6L, was noted to have a bandemia on
his WBC, and set to the ED.
.
In the ED, he was noted to be febrile to 101.2  BP 106/70 and
was 88% on RA, and placed on 6L O2 with sats 93-100, in addition
a RIJ was placed with a CVP of 4.  He was given Vancomycin,
levaquin, flagyl, and sent to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he was complaining of lower abd pain X 2
wks.  No N/V/diarrhea. + constipation. No cough.  No f/c.

.
EKG: 70bpm NA, LBBB, unchanged from previous
.
CXR [**2110-4-25**]
The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG with broken
lower sternal wires  broken, unchanged.  The left-sided
pacemaker with its two leads terminating in the right atrium and
right ventricle is unchanged. The heart size is enlarged but
stable.
There is slight worsening of left lower lobe opacity which is
kmown
to be partially due to  round atelectasis but a new overlying
infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  In addition, there
is worsening of the right lower lobe consolidation, thus a
combination of this finding is strongly suggestive for
aspiration, although bilateral infection process is a
possibility.
.
Gallbladder US [**2110-4-25**]:
1. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.
2. Small right-sided pleural effusion.
.
Echo [**2110-5-3**]
Conclusions:
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (EF 20%),
with more
prominent septal hypokinesis. Due to limited views, more precise
regional wall
motion abnormalities cannot be assessed. Right ventricular
chamber size is
normal. There is moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion. Severe left ventricular
systolic
dysfunction. Moderate aortic regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-14**], no
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a 54 yo male with pmh of CHF
(EF 25%), DM1 s/p pancreatic/ kidney transplant, CAD s/p CABG,
admitted for SOB/hypoxia, found to have asp. PNA. He was
transferred to the CCU [**1-10**] to VT/VF. In the CCU he had several
episodes of VT/VF s/p multiple shocks. He was started on CVVH
[**1-10**] to ARF. He remained ventilator dependent. He had
intermittent pressor requirements and was maintained on a
lidocaine GTT. He was made DNR/DNI and expired from cardiac
arrest.
.
1. VT/VF: Pt. has a h/o of VT in the past for which an ICD was
placed. On day of transfer to the CCU, the patient had several
episodes of VT/VF and was shocked numerous time by his ICD
unsuccessfully, requiring external shocks as well. Etiology of
the current episode is likely due to his pre-disposition to this
arrythmia in combination with metabolic derrangements
(hyperkalemia, acidosis). Pt. was given lidocaine boluses, his
metabolic derrangements were corrected and burst pacing was used
to terminate his VT. He was kept on a lidocaine drip
transiently. While weaning off the lidocaine drip, mexiletine
has been started. Despite antiarrythmics, he continued to have
episodes of VT which again req. several external shocks. Because
of his rapidly deteriorating condition, he was made DNR/DNI. He
expired surrounded by his family.
.
2) Hypovolemia: Pt. appeared dry on admission, with high BUN/CRT
ratio. He was also several pounds below his dry weight.  He
received aggressive re-hydration. His volume status was
monitored by clinical exam and by CVP.
.
3) SOB/Hypoxia: Multifactoral etiology. He had
amiodarone-induced pulm fibrosis and aspiration PNA. It was felt
that his SOB was not due to CHF. He remained intubated since the
VT/VF e
