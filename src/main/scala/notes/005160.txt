Service:  Trauma Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
gentleman who was struck by a car while walking.

He was initially taken to [**Hospital6 **] Emergency
Department where he was alert but with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale
of 12 to 13.  He was found to have a small left parietal
bleed, a right humeral head fracture, a right tibial plateau
fracture, a right distal clavicle fracture, and a right two
through fifth rib fracture.  His cervical spine films were
negative by plain film and by CAT scan.  An abdominal CT had
no intra-abdominal injury.  There, he was given a tetanus,
placed in a right sling, his right knee was immobilized, and
he was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for neurosurgical and orthopaedic care.

Upon arrival, he was complaining of right shoulder and right
knee pain, and a Foley catheter was placed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure.
4.  Gastrointestinal bleed.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Colon polyps.
7.  Anemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Levoxyl, pyridostigmine, Lasix,
Flomax.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination heart rate was 84, blood pressure of 112 by
palpation, respiratory rate of 22, oxygen saturation of 94%
on face mask.  [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale was 16.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light at 2 mm
to 1 mm.  Extraocular movements were intact.  Tympanic
membranes were clear bilaterally.  The oropharynx without
injury.  No cervical spine tenderness to palpation.  Lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No crepitus.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender.
Pelvis was stable and nontender.  Rectal with normal tone.
No blood.  Foley in place.  Extremities revealed 3+ bilateral
pitting edema but with palpable dorsalis pedis pulses equal
bilaterally.  Right shoulder swelling and tenderness over the
distal clavicle and over his right ribs.  Swelling of his
right knee with immobilizer in place.  Right arm was in a
sling.  Ecchymosis over his right shoulder.  Neurologically,
cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  Motor strength
was [**4-25**] in the bilateral upper and lower extremities.
Sensation was fully intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratories revealed a hematocrit at [**Hospital6 12826**] of 30.3, and repeat hematocrit at [**Hospital1 346**] of 25.3, platelets were 113.  INR
of 1.6 and PTT of 36.1.  Urinalysis had 20 to 50 red blood
cells and 0 to 2 white blood cells.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm
at 60, left axis deviation, normal intervals.  Q waves in
III, aVF and I.  No acute ischemic changes.

Chest x-ray showed a right pulmonary contusion, right distal
clavicle fracture, right rib fracture.

The rest of the studies as detailed in the History of Present
Illness.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 84-year-old gentleman, status post
struck in automobile pedestrian accident, with right
intracranial and subdural hematomas, and multiple orthopaedic
injuries.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for frequent neurologic checks.  An
arterial blood gas was obtained an a PA catheter was placed
to guide initial fluid management as his blood pressure began
to trend downward to the 90s/60s.

Orthopaedics was consulted for his multiple injuries, and
Neurosurgery was consulted for his intracranial hemorrhage
and subdural hematoma.  Nonoperative management was deemed
for his cranial injury.  He was placed on a q.1h. neurologic
checks with a repeat CAT scan in 24 hours and blood pressure
control.  His INR was slightly elevated, so he was transfused
2 units of fresh frozen plasma and was started on
Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. for seizure prophylaxis.

For his orthopaedics, Orthopaedic Surgery evaluated his
injuries and felt that nonoperative management of his right
distal clavicle and right proximal humerus fracture was
optimal with a right sling.  For his right tibial plateau
fracture, Orthopaedics elected for nonoperative management
with a cast placed and strict nonweightbearing.

In terms of his intracranial and subdural hematomas, a repeat
CAT scan in 24 hours showed no advancement of that.  His INR
was kept below 1.4 with repeat fresh frozen plasma, and his
mental status remained intact, as well as his motor and
sensory examinations.  He slowly improved back to close to
his baseline.

The patient was observed closely in the Intensive Care Unit
for four days and then transferred to the floor.  He did have
an episode prior to leaving the Intensive Care Unit when he
had dyspnea which was treated with Lasix and albuterol.  A
CAT scan showed bilateral pleural effusions, for which
bilateral chest tubes were placed for serosanguineous fluid.
These were left in place for two days and then discontinued,
as they only drained a small amount of serosanguineous fluid.

He was placed on Protonix, Dilantin, and subcutaneous heparin
for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.  He was continued on
his pyridostigmine, Synthroid, and Flomax; and he was also
given Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis which was to be
continued until [**4-27**].

Upon transfer to the floor he remained stable.  Physical
Therapy evaluated the patient and felt that he was
appropriate for discharge to a rehabilitation facility, which
would be more appropriate for his continued rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To a rehabilitation facility; the exact
facility was still pending at the time of this dictation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  For his rehabilitation, the patient
is nonweightbearing on his right upper extremity and right
lower extremity with goals of bed to wheelchair transfers.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Status post automobile pedestrian accident.
 2.  Right intracranial hemorrhage.
 3.  Right subdural hematoma.
 4.  Right clavicle fracture.
 5.  Right proximal humerus fracture.
 6.  Right tibial plateau fracture.
 7.  Congestive heart failure.
 8.  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
 9.  Hypothyroidism.
10.  Colon polyps.
11.  Anemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Levoxyl 150 mcg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Pyridostigmine 60 mg p.o. t.i.d.
 3.  Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. (until [**4-27**]).
 4.  Miconazole powder to affected areas b.i.d.
 5.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
 6.  Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.h.s.
 7.  Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.
 8.  Morphine sulfate 2 mg intravenously subcutaneous q.4h.
p.r.n.
 9.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
