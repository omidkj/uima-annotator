Intensive Care Unit Medicine Service on [**2200-4-7**], with the
chief complaint of acute myocardial infarction and fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53 year old
white female with a history of coronary artery disease,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and two pack per day
tobacco use with previous coronary artery bypass graft
surgery presenting to an outside hospital on [**2200-4-6**], with a
two day history of fevers and confusion.  The patient had a

While in the outside hospital Emergency Department, the
patient complained of chest pain.  The patient states that
she has had this pain for approximately two weeks with no
relief.  She was given Levofloxacin for apparent community
acquired pneumonia and cardiac enzymes were cycled.  The
patient was found to have a troponin of 3.98 which rose to
6.10 as well as CK MBs of 17.3 and 15.2 but no CPKs were
recorded.  The patient's white blood cell count at that time
was 20.6.  The patient received Lovenox and Aspirin and was
transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

Of note, the patient's husband reports that she possibly took
approximately 17 tablets of 300 mg of Neurontin in the five
days prior to admission.

respiratory rate 17, blood pressure 89/50 with a mean of 67,
oxygen saturation 98% on nonrebreather.  Of note, the patient
states that her blood pressure usually runs between 80 and 90

difficulty remembering and formulating thoughts.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular

question of upper airway sounds transmitted to the anterior
and midaxillary line.  Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel
sounds.  The extremities were warm, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  No edema.  Femoral pulses 2+, no bruits.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative per Emergency
Department report at the outside hospital.

LABORATORY DATA:  From the outside hospital, white count 20.6
with 89 neutrophils, 1 band, 5 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes,
hematocrit 38.2, platelets 222, MCV 94.9.  Sodium 138,
potassium 4.1, chloride 98, bicarbonate 37, blood urea
nitrogen 16, creatinine 0.7, glucose 111.  Prothrombin time
12.3, partial thromboplastin time 28.9, INR 1.05.  As
previously mentioned, troponin was 3.98 and 6.10 as well as
CK MBs of 17.3 and 15.2 although no CPKs obtainable.  Albumin
3.4, total protein 6.5, alkaline phosphatase 148, AST 109,
ALT 25, total bilirubin 0.3, calcium 8.9.  Urinalysis was
notable for urine protein of 30.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of
88 beats per minute.  Q-Tc 443, normal axis.  ST elevations
in leads III, aVF, ST depressions in leads I, aVL and V1
through V3 with a Q wave in lead III.

Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate and no pulmonary edema
although CT scan did show some question of a left lower lobe
infiltrate not seen on chest x-ray.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for management of
confusion, fever, elevated white count, chest pain, and
question of myocardial infarction in the setting of coronary
artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft four
years prior.  CKs were cycled.  The patient was held NPO and
family members were [**Name (NI) 653**].  The patient was continued on
Levofloxacin as started at the outside hospital and given
inhalers p.r.n.

A psychiatry consultation was obtained on the morning of
[**2200-4-7**], given the patient's significant degree of
disorientation and confusion and labile emotions.  The
psychiatrist's impression was that the patient was suffering
from delirium with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
examination with poor memory.  At the time of the interview,
the patient was agreeing to consider catheterization although
it was noted that if she changed her mind given the
importance of this procedure that her husband and children
should be [**Doctor Last Name 653**] regarding consent for the procedure and
that her capacity to consent at that time should be held in
question.  Recommendations were made for Haldol p.r.n. as
well as Xanax.  B12, folate, RPR and TSH were all ordered
which returned as normal.  The patient also had a head CT at
the outside hospital which was unremarkable.

CKs were sent at our hospital with initial level of CPK 464,
MB 12 and a troponin of 49 obtained.  The patient had been
placed on Heparin prior to the anticipation of cardiac
catheterization. The patient was initially consented to have
cardiac catheterization on [**2200-4-7**], although had an acute
decompensation in mental status and anxiety attack and it was
determined that she would be at high risk for the procedure
at that time.  Thus, the procedure was deferred to the
morning of [**2200-4-8**], and findings were as follows:

Left ventricular ejection fraction 62%.  Inferior
hypokinesis.  Normal valves.  Discrete proximal right
coronary artery lesion of 100% stenosis.  Left main 100%
discrete stenosis.  Mid left anterior descending discrete
100% stenosis, 50% discrete midcircumflex stenosis.  Bypass
graft saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was
100% discrete stenosis.  Left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending patent and RIMA to the right
coronary artery with a 40% stenosis.  No intervention was
performed.

It was determined that the patient should be maximized on
medical therapy only.  The patient was prescribed with
Aspirin and Plavix at that time and given diuresis for
increasing oxygen requirement.  The patient returned to the
floor in stable condition and was to the Step-Down Cardiac
Unit on [**2200-4-8**].  The patient returned to baseline mental
status throughout the remainder of her hospital stay and was
determined to be in stable condition by [**2200-4-10**], to be
discharged.  The patient was in agreement with this plan.

    bypass graft in [**2195**], now with occluded saphenous vein
    graft to be medically managed.

3.  Elevated cholesterol.
4.  Chronic low back pain.
5.  Bronchitis with possible acute pneumonia.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Depression.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times nine days to complete
