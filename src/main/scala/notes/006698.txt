[**2153-7-26**] ECG:Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular
response. Right bundle-branch block. Loss of R waves in the
anteroseptal leads suggests old anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. Generalized low QRS voltage. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2153-7-17**] no significant diagnostic change.
.
[**2153-7-26**] PORTABLE AP CHEST: Comparison is made to [**2153-7-17**].
Lung volumes remain low with worsening retrocardiac opacity. A
small left pleural effusion may be present. There is no evidence
of pneumothorax.
Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG with an
unchanged enlarged cardiac silhouette. Pulmonary vascularity
appears stable and there is no evidence of overt edema. A
Port-A- Cath is in stable course and position.
.
IMPRESSION: Worsening retrocardiac opacity may represent
atelectasis however focal infectious consolidation cannot be
excluded. When clinically feasible, PA and lateral views would
help further evaluate.

Brief Hospital Course:
78M with CHF and longstanding cardiac cirrhosis presented with
repeated exacerbation of cardiac cirrhosis. Admitted to MICU for
paracentesis and hemodynamic monitoring, subsequently
transferred to floor for follow-up care. Pt presented on [**7-26**]
with exacerbated ascites severe enough to cause shortness of
breath and dyspnea. On [**7-27**] he underwent paracentesis with
removal of 4.3 liters of fluid (negative for SBP). His symptoms
drastically improved. On admission his diuretics were briefly
held for concern of renal failure, but were restarted on
transfer to the floor [**7-28**]. However, given his renal failure and
relative hyponatremia, his lasix dose was decreased and should
be titrated upwards with care. Urine output was acceptable
throughout. On [**7-30**] patient underwent regularly scheduled
paracentesis and was discharged back to his rehab facility.
.
With regards to his CHF, his digoxin level was 1.0 on admission.
Dig was held initially but restarted on the floor.
.
With regards to his DYSPNEA, his oxygen saturations have
remained normal off of supplemental oxygen. He denies SOB and
now speaks in complete sentences without breathlessness. His
crackles at lungh bases may represent transudative effusions
passing via diaphragm.
.
With regards to his ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, his baseline
is variable and fluctuates between 1 and 2. On admission, his
creatinine was 2.0, and on discharge it was 1.5. As mentioned,
he was never oliguric. His lasix and aldactone were restarted,
but lasix was continued at a lower dose than on admission.
.
With regards to his ANASARCA/EDEMA, he underwent 2 paracenteses,
on [**7-27**] and [**7-30**]. His perionteal fluid showed no evidence of SBP.
.
With regards to his ANEMIA, he received 2 units PRBCs in the
MICU with appropriate bump in Hct. His baseline Hct 24-28, and
on discharge it was stable at 27.9.
.
With regards to his HYPOTHYROIDISM, we continued his
levothyroxine 150 mcg po qd thoughout his stay.
.
With regards to his A-FIB, his rate was well controlled
throughout his stay. As with previous admissions, the decision
was made not to anticoagulate him based on his history of GI
bleeding from colonic AVMs.
.
With regards to his DELIRIUM, he briefly exhibited confused and
aggressive behavior in the MICU, and was placed on Abilify qd.
However, on transfer to the floor, no such behavior was noted,
and the medication will be d/c'ed on discharge.
.
He ate a regular diet, and minimal IVF was given for fear of
developing more ascites.
.
Prophylactically, he complained of constipation despite being on
Senna/Colace. We added bisacodyl 10mg po/pr qd and milk of
magnesia, with good effect. We continued his PPI. He was not
anticoagulated as mentioned above.
.
He continues to be DNR/DNI code status.
