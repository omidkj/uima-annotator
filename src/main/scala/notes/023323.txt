Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**]
Chief Complaint:
 BRBPR s/p catheterization procedure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory Laparotomy
Right Colectomy
Ileocolostomy

Cardiac cathetrization with stenting of the RPLB and RPDA.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 y.o. man with a history of HTN, CAD who underwent
catheterization on [**2121-9-24**] with placement of a total of 5
stents (4 drug eluting in the PLB, PDA and RCA (mid, distal and
proximal) transferred from the CMI service for BRBPR. The
patient was cath'd in the setting of uncontrolled HTN,
progressive DOE x 6 months and a positive stress test. The
patient's cath was without complication and revealed one vessel
disease with in-stent restenosis from a prior cath to the RCA.
Approximately 24 hours post-cath, while on aspirin and plavix
(last heparin pre-cath) the patient had 3 episodes of BRBPR. The
patient has remained hemodynamically stable with BP in the
108-115/50's range with pulse in the 80's. The patient is
without symptoms, denying CP, SOB, dizziness or lightheadedness.
The patient's Hct dropped from 34.2 post-cath to 29.9. NG lavage
was negative for blood.

Colonoscopy showed 2 AVMs near the cecum in the ascending colon,
started bleeding on manipulation - BiCapped/injected,
accidentally perforated cecum. Pt. descended into septic shock,
and was taken to OR for R colectomy and washout.

Past Medical History:
2 infrarenal aortic aneurysms (1.4cm, 2.3cm)
HTN
CAD. s/p cath in [**2116**] due to abnormal stress with totally
occluded mid RCA and 50-70%proximal RCA with successful stenting

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2121-9-25**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal, and the cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic
function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%), without regional wall motion
abnormalities. There is
abnormal flow in the left ventricle, consistent with a
mid-cavitary gradient.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic
root and the ascending aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets
(?number) are moderately thickened. There may be minimal aortic
valve
stenosis, however present evaluation of aortic valve area is
limited by
high-velocity contamination from the intracavitary gradient.
Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Small left ventricular cavity with hyperdynamic left
ventricular
systolic function. Mid-cavitary gradient. Probable minimal
aortic stenosis.
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.

A repeat transthoracic study to reassess the mid-cavitary
gradient and
determine severity of aortic stenosis may be performed following
an
intravenous fluid challenge.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2121-9-27**] 8:38 PM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with 2 infrarenal aotic aneursysms, HTN, CAD,
s/p elective cath, with new LGIB, s/p EGD, cauterized for
polyps/hemmorhoids, today w/ severe abd pain, unable to have BM.


IMPRESSION:
1. There is stranding and cecal wall thickening within the right
lower quadrant, with tiny adjacent foci of air. This is
consistent with focal perforation. There is adjacent fluid
within the mesentery and pelvis also noted.
2. There is calcification of the gallbladder wall and then the
gallbladder lumen, findings are consistent with a single large
calcified stone or porcelain gallbladder.
3. There is aortic calcification noted, however there is no
significant aneurysmal dilatation identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
The Surgical service assumed care of the patient and he went to
the OR on [**2121-9-28**]. A
Colonoscopy showed 2 AVMs near the cecum in the ascending colon,
started bleeding on manipulation - BiCapped/injected,
accidentally perforated cecum. Pt. descended into septic shock,
and was taken to OR for R colectomy and washout.

Post-operatively he was admitted to SICU. Intermittently, he was
hypotensive/tachycardic, and responsive to IVF.
Cardiology was consulted and they stated that post op, he had a
brief period on Levophed and neo now off pressors HD sable. [**3-5**]
episodes of SOB lasting ~ 10 mins
EKG unchanged, sinus with RBBB, old inf qs. He had a slight bump
of CK, trop now trending down. He was started back on ASA,
Plavix, Zocor.

Pain: He became slightly confused with IV Morphine. The
narcotics were discontinued and he was comfortable with Tylenol.


ABD/GI: He was NPO, with IV fluids. His abdomen was round and
largely distended. He reported + flatus and +BM. His abdomen
began to soften over the next few days. His diet was slowly
advanced. His incision was intact.

Resp: He was on O2 via nasal cannula and had O2 saturation in
the 90's. As he became more mobile, his O2 requirements
decreased and was discontinued.

PT: PT evaluated this patient and cleared him for home.

[**9-29**] MRSA: neg., VRE: neg.  all blood and urine cultures were
negative.
*****
On [**10-5**], he was getting ready for discharge, but then was noted
to have salmon-colored fluid emanating from the lower portion of
his midline incision. Bedside inspection demonstrated no
evidence of evisceration. The decision was made to take the
patient to the operating room for further exploration and to
address a likely dehiscence. The fascia was repaired with
figure-of-eight Prolene sutures and 4 retention sutures.

Post-operatively, he was NPO and antibiotics were continued. He
had a PCA for pain control and was on bedrest for 1 day. He was
then assisted by PT on POD [**9-1**] and encouraged to ambulate
safely. His antibiotics were D/C'd on POD [**9
