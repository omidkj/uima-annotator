Brief Hospital Course:
 A/P: 42 yo M w/ Hx of bipolar disorder on Paxil, Effexor,
nortriptyline; R shoulder pain on Morphine who presents with AH,
agitation, and Tmax 101.2.
.
# Psych:  Patient has possible serotonin syndrome (on Paxil 60mg
daily, Effexor 300mg, and nortriptyline 40 [**Hospital1 **]), presents with
delerium, hallucinations, myoclonus/tremor, tachycardia, and
fever.  NMS is a possibility with fever and MS change (on
olanzapine), but usually less acute in onset.  Infectious causes
have been effectively ruled out: CXR nl, UA with rare bacteria,
blood cx NGTD, LP normal.  The other likely diagnosis was
baclofen withdrawal (rigidity, hallucinations, hyperthermia).
Other diagnoses entertained also included anticholinergic
delirium, opioid withdrawal (very high doses of morphine as
outpatient and was recently switched <1 day to methadone), EtOH
withdrawal as BAL 1.2 at OSH, [**Location (un) 3484**] syndrome as hypokalemic
but random cortisol 20.6 so less likely, elevated Na, and
agitation. Patient initially on Ativan and Cyproheptadine, which
have been which were stopped. An ABG was checked and it was
normal.  TSH low normal at 0.83. The leading diagnosis was
serotonin syndrome. In consultation with the psychiatry service
all his psychiatric medications were held including effexor,
nortriptyline, paxil, Zyprexa, Klonopin, Norflex, amantadine,
Zonegram, Lamictal, Zolpedim, Methocarbamol. He was restarted on
his Baclofen 5mg TID and maintained on a Valium CIWA scale for
possible withdrawal and intermittent mild agitation. He required
only 5mg Valium every 6 hours at maximum. At the time of
discharge, his vitals were stable, without tachycardia or fever,
the patient was calm and denying hallucinations. It was felt
that he was stable enough to return home with close psychiatric
follow up by his VNA and his outpatient psychiatrist. Prior to
discharge we was restarted on olanzapine 20mg PO QHS with
further medication changes to be determined by his outpatient
psychiatrist.
.
# Peripheral Neuropathy: Patient began noting increasing old
peripheral neuropathy in hands and feet after discontinuation of
Nortryptyline. This medication was restarted in consultation
with Psychiatry for the patients comfort with good effect.
.
# R shoulder pain: Patient on MS Contin 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] as
outpatient, switched to Methadone at [**Hospital 1680**] Hospital. The
methadone was stopped and the patient was changed to PRN
Morphine IR q4 with good effect and no signs of withdrawal. He
should follow up with the Pain Center after discharge.
.
# Elevated CK: His CK was up to 1436 upon admission, with
concern for rhabdomyolysis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
However it continued to trend down with some gentle hydration,
1436->1175->817->362->188 upon discharge.
.
# EKG changes: Initially EKG showed ST depression in V2-V5, no
prior EKG to compare. He was ruled out for acute coronary
syndrome by negative cardiac biomarkers times 3 and and repeat
EKG showed improvement/resolution of these changes.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia
- Holding Lipitor while CK elevated
.
# fEN/PPx - no indication for PPI, not on PPI at home.  No
aspiration concern currently, Regular diet: feeds with
supervision.
