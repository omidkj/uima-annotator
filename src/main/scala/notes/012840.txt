Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 174**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-11-2**] for surgical
repair of her atrial septal defect. She was taken directly to

septal defect. Please see operative note for details. She
tolerated the operation well and postoperatively she was taken
to the intensive care unit for monitoring. She was
hemodynamically stable in the immediate post operative period,
she awoke neurologically [**Date Range 5235**] and was extubated. She was
started on beta blockade, statin and aspirin. On POD 1 she
experienced right hand numbness which resolved over the day.

conservative management with warm compresses. She was then
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. She was
gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with her
postoperative strength and mobility. The remainder of her post
