[**2118-6-17**]:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
[**Month/Day/Year 113**] contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF=30 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST CPB:
1. Imprpoved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolc function, EF = 30-35%.
(Milrinone and Epinephrine)
2. Saddle shaped complete annuloplasty ring seen in the
mitralposition. Well seated and good leaflet excursion.
Peak gradient = 10 mm HG and a mean gradiet of 4 mm HG (Cardiac
output 5 lit/min)
3. Trace TR and intact aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission Heparin was started and he underwent mitral
repair and single coronary graft as noted.  See operative note
for details. He weaned fom pressors onNeo Synephrine,
Epinephrine and Propofol infusions.  His ejection fraction post
bypass was still 30-40 %.

He transferred to the ICU where he awakened intact, was weaned
and extubated and pressors were weaned off.  His CTs were
removed per protocol as were temporary pacing wires.

Coumadin was begun for his chronic atrial fibrillation. He was
diuresed towards his preoperative weiht and Physical Therapy
worked with him for mobility and strength.

Arrangements were made for Coumadin follow up at [**Hospital **] Medical
[**Hospital 197**] Clinic as preop. He will be staying at his daughter's
home after discharge until he returns to his own home. VNA will
see him as well. He was discharged home with VNA services on
post operative day 4 in stable condition.  All follow up
appointments were arranged.
