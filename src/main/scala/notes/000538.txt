Imaging:
[**2111-7-17**]: Chest CT (oupt): Bilateral apical consolidation with
traction bronchiectasis consistent with post-radiation changes.
Bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities in both upper lobes and
right lower lobe, which may be due to infectious or inflammatory
etiology.  A
followup CT scan is recommended in 3 months. Stable right-sided
septal thickening and right pleural thickening.
.
[**8-2**] MRI head: Small (4 x 7 mm), ring-enhancing mass within the
left pontine tegmentum, with signal and enhancement
characteristics of some concern for an abscess. Neoplastic
disease would be a secondary consideration, in view of the
history of prior breast cancer. Rim enhancement would be very
atypical for an infarct.
.
[**8-4**]: Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall  motion is normal (LVEF>=60%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
[**8-4**]: CT chest: New moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
bilateral basilar atelectasis. Bilateral apical consolidation
with traction bronchiectasis. No evidence of lymphangitic spread
of disease.
.
[**8-4**]: CT neck: No evidence of lymphadenopathy noted on this neck
CT. Sinus disease. Bilateral pleural effusion.
.
[**8-6**]: CT sinuses: The left sphenoid cell is almost completely
opacified.  This may be second
