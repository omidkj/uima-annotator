Admission Date:  [**2182-1-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2182-1-22**]


Service:  [**Year (4 digits) **]

DIAGNOSES:  Left middle cerebral artery stroke.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
Russian-speaking left-handed man with a left parietal stroke
in [**2170**], hypertension, and mild memory problems who presented
on [**2182-1-8**] with a dense aphasia and right facial
droop with right arm weakness.  He had a similar episode and
was recently admitted but this quickly resolved and workup
was unremarkable.

In the Emergency Room, MR imaging revealed a left
frontoparietal refusion spilling.  He was given IV TPA at 12
noon.  He was subsequently admitted to the Neurological
Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.

Unfortunately, he had no clinical improvement and remains
mute with a dense right hemiparesis.  Subsequent MR imaging
and angiogram revealed no flow beyond the proximal left MCA.
He was, therefore, admitted to the Neurologic Medicine
Service for further treatment.

who is functionally quite intact.  He has a daughter who is
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 105641**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 105642**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General appearance:  The
patient was an elderly man in no acute distress.  Vital
signs:  Temperature maximum 38.6, blood pressure
147-187/58-80, SP02 98% on room air.  Head and neck:  Supple.
Mucous membranes moist.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm,
normal rate.  Pulmonary:  Good air movement but has some
crackles at the bases.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Neurologic:  Mr. [**Known lastname 105640**] is
minimally arousable and does not respond to name.  Cranial
nerves:  There was no anisocoria.  The pupils react normally
to light.  The eyes deviated to the left but appeared to
cross midline.  Does not track.  Does not respond to visual
threat.  Facial droop on the right noted.  Motor system:
Tone is increased in the lower extremities bilaterally.
Right arm is flaccid.  Moves left arm and leg spontaneously.
Right leg contracture, passively moved.  Reflexes:  Brisk,
more so on the right.  Plantar reflexes were extensor on the
right, flexor on the left.  Sensory:  Appears to respond to
touch and temperature in all extremities except for the right
arm and hand.

LABORATORY DATA/OTHER STUDIES:  White count 10.2, hemoglobin
12.9, hematocrit 36.3, heart rate 87.  Differential with 82
PMNs, 0 bands, 8.3 lymphs.  Sodium 143, potassium 4.6,
chloride 112, bicarbonate 21, BUN 31, creatinine 1.3.

Chest x-ray:  Left lower lobe infiltrate with some evidence
of volume overload.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 105640**] has suffered a complete left
MCA occlusion with resultant infarction and dense right
hemiplegia with aphasia.  He has shown minimal to no
improvement over the course of his hospitalization.  However,
during the course he was more alert and interactive.  He was
able to respond to name call on the right and has made
several efforts to mumble and grunt that are not
understandable but shows clear evidence of attempts to
communicate.

His pneumonia was treated successfully with levofloxacin and
metronidazole.

After extensive discussion with his daughter and son in-law
and his likely poor recovery prognosis, they indicated that
Mr. [**Known lastname 105640**] would not want to carry on life without the
quality of life that he has indicated to his daughter that he
expects.  Therefore, based on Mr. [**Known lastname 105643**] wishes as
articulated by his family, he was made a DNR-DNI.  Within the
subsequent weeks of discussion given his minimal clinical
improvement, his daughter states that he would not want
further life sustaining treatments and, therefore, after a
meeting with the family, the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the
house staff, we have decided to focus on Mr. [**Known lastname 105643**]
comfort care.

Therefore, his fluids and antibiotics along with other
medications were discontinued except for medications that
provide comfort such as morphine and Ativan.

Mr. [**Known lastname 105640**] was not aware enough to take food and swallow
consistently, but as he becomes more alert and awake, we have
been able to give him a trial of food for his comfort.  We
recognize that this may result in pneumonia; however, his
family is aware and is fully supportive of this endeavor.

At the time of this dictation, Mr. [**Known lastname 105640**] is clinically
stable and comfortable.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Comfortable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to a palliative care facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Complete proximal left middle cerebral
artery infarction with resultant global aphasia and dense
right hemiplegia.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypotension.
2.  Left parietal stroke in [**2170**].
3.  Chronic low back pain.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Early dementia.
6.  Chronic renal failure.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Tylenol 650 mg p.r. q six hours scheduled.
2.  Morphine 1-2 mg IV q. four hours p.r.n. discomfort.

Thank you for the opportunity to care for this very
unfortunate [**Age over 90 **]-year-old.
