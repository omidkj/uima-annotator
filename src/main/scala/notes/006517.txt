Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and lethargy at outpatient HD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) removal of right internal jugular dialysis line
2) placement of left internal jugular temporary HD line
3) conversion of temporary HD line to left internal jugular
tunneled catheter
4) hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
55 year-old male with a history of ESRD on [**Hospital 58910**] transferred from
outpatient HD for fever to 102 and lethargy. Prior to transfer,
blood cultures were drawn and he was given a dose of Vancomycin
and ceftazidime. Of note, he was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 404**]
and [**Month (only) 956**] of this year also with fevers. In [**Month (only) 404**], he was
treated empirically for a line infection, although cultures were
negative, and completed a 14-day course of Vancomycin. During
the admission in [**Month (only) 956**], patient found to have pneumonia and
was treated with 14-days of levofloxacin
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were T:102.9 BP:176/81 HR:78 RR:16
O2Sat:96% on 3L. He was subsquently found to be markedly
hypertensive (199/106) and hypoxic (86% on 4 litres), feeling
lethargic. He was started on a nitroglycerin gtt at 16:50 and
placed on non-rebreather. By 18:55, patient's blood pressure had
come down to 133/65. Given the hypoxia, there was concern for
pneumonia so he was empirically given 1 dose of levofloxacin
750mg IV after blood cultures were again drawn. He received a
chest CT-A for hypoxia that demonstrated pulmonary oedema with
embolism. He also received a head CT given mental status changes
and this was unremarkable. Patient's oxygenation improved with
blood prsesure control, and supplemental oxygenation was
down-titrated to 3 litres nasal cannula, with a saturation of
95%. He was admitted for further workup.
.
With his wife providing interpretation this AM, he denies any
feeling any fevers, chills, pain, or SOB. No cough or new sputum
production. No worsening peripheral edema. He endorses a higher
salt diet intake recently, but states he has taken all of his
medications as prescribed without fail and has attended all HD
sessions as usual.

status as well as CHF.
.
[**2189-5-11**] CTA CHEST IMPRESSION:
1. No central or proximal segmental pulmonary embolism.
Respiratory motion limits more distal assessment.
2. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
effusions with associated lower lobe atelectasis. Borderline
mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be reactive.
3. Moderate size pericardial effusion, which is larger than on

IMPRESSION: Thickened edematous tissue surrounding the right
hemodialysis port as it travels through the subcutaneous
tissues. The appearance of this tissue is worrisome for an
infectious site.
.
[**5-13**] Transthoracic Echo:
IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of endocarditis or abscess seen.
There is a Chiari network/prominent Eustachian valve seen which,
at least theoretically, could [**Hospital1 **] a vegetation. There is a
moderate to large pericardial effusion mostly located behind the
infero-lateral wall which is 2cm at its maximum width in
diastole. No echo evidence of tamponade. Mild pulmonary artery
systoli hypertension.
.
[**5-14**] Temporary Line PLacement
Successful placement of temporary double-lumen hemodialysis
catheter via the left internal jugular vein, with the catheter
tip located in the proximal right atrium. The line is ready to
use.
.
[**2189-5-15**] TUNNELLED CATH PLACEMENT
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 15.5 French, 27-cm
tip-to-cuff double- lumen hemodialysis catheter via the left
internal jugular vein with the tip in the right atrium. Bleeding
in the access site was felt to reflect the effect of aspirin and
Plavix therapy and was successfully controlled with manual
pressure and Gelfoam embolization of the tunnel.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year-old male with ESRD on HD, labile hypertension, and h/o
recent line infection now p/w fever and lethargy, found to have
high grade MRSA bacteremia likely to due to line infection.
Infection likely responsible for sympathetic discharge leading
to hypertensive urgency, which in turn led to pulmonary oedema
on presentation. Hospital course by problem:
.
#. MRSA Line Sepsis -  blood cultures (in house and from outpt
HD) grew MRSA, line also grew MRSA. Had been started on vanc at
HD prior to admission, continued qHD while in-house. Will need 4
weeks of vancomycin from last positive blood culture ([**2189-5-12**]),
neding with HD on [**2189-6-8**]. Transplant surgery removed right IJ
line on [**5-12**], IR placed temporary left IJ line on [**5-14**], and
converted to left IJ tunneled catheter on [**2189-5-15**]. Pt was
afebrile after admission. Had a TTE without e/o endocarditis,
therefore a TEE was not needed.
.
#. ESRD - was markedly volume overloaded on presentation,
improved with HD. Was serially dialyzed with improvement in
volume status, electr
