Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 452**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o. man with seizure d/o and chronic cough p/w
worsening productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and fever up
to 103.4 rectally. He was originally admitted to the MICU for a
transiet pressor requirement.  He was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin antibiotic therapy for a likely left-sided
pneumonia.  His oxygenation status was stable throughout his
hospital course.  He was changed to cefpodoxime and azithromycin
PO for a total 2-week course. Cardiac etiology for his pleuritic
chest pain was continued but the EKG remaied unchanged and his
cardiac enzymes were negative.  I slightly elevated troponin was
attributed to acute renal failure.
.
During the hospitalization he had frequent evening episodes of
delirium thought to be secondary to his hospitalization and
recent infection.  Repeat blood and urine cultures remained
negative.  He was redirectable.  Concern for seizure was raised
but per his family and health care aid, his seizures present
with tonic clonic movements or episodes of staring.  He remained
on his home dose of Keppra. His family requested to not use any
antipsychotics.  He had a 1:1 sitter and was alert and oriented
at discharge.
.
The patient presented with an elevated creatinine to 1.4 with a
baseline Cr of 1.0 to 1.2.  This was believed to be

.
Acute renal failure: baseline cr 0.8-1.0. Admission creatinine
peaked at 1.4 thought to be likely pre-renal in setting of
sepsis. Creatinine trended down with hydration and was 0.7 on
discharge.
.
He was discharged home with VNA services and physical therapy
and has 24-hour caregivers at home.
