Radiology:

CTA head - high density material seen tracking along sulci in
the
frontal lobes bilaterally, temporal lobes bilaterally, with
blood
layering in the lateral ventricles, in the suprasellar cistern,
consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. blood tracking along
falx and left tentorium also seen, suggesting subdural hematoma
as well.  largest focus of blood seen midline, just superior to
anterior horns of lateral ventricles, with slight mass effect on
the anterior horns of lateral ventricles. CTA demonstrates [**7-2**]

ACOM aneurysm, apparently on left side.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: infiltrate?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with SAH, now with fever
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
infiltrate?
INDICATION: 78-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage, now
with fever.

COMPARISON: AP upright portable chest x-ray dated [**2102-2-14**].

AP SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: Right subclavian central
venous catheter and nasogastric tubes are in unchanged position.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal
and stable. There are mild intramural aortic calcifications.
Right perihilar consolidation appears less prominent than on
prior exam, and may represent resolving pneumonia. Mild left
lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease in intensity of right perihilar
consolidation, consistent with resolving pneumonia. No new
consolidations are identified.
2. Nasogastric tube remains with the proximal side-port closely
possitioned at the GE junction and advancement is recommended.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2102-2-11**]  9:49:54 AM


Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation with possible left anterior
fascicular block.
Probable left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2102-2-1**] no diagnostic change.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall
normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Moderate PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly
thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic
gradient is likely related to high stroke volume. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

No cardiac source of embolus identified.
