CATH:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe
left main and two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
calcified
with a distal 80% lesion leading into the ostial LAD and ostial
LCx. The
LAD was calcified with the ostial 80% lesion and mild diffuse
disease.
The LCx was calcified with the ostial 80% lesion and an
additional 80%
stenosis proximally. The AV groove LCx was small distally. The
RCA had a
high anterior origin and was mildly calcified with mild diffuse
plaquing
to 25%.
2. Abdominal aortography demonstrated mild tapering of the
distal aorta,
a 60% proximal left renal artery stenosis, and mild bilateral
common
iliac artery plaquing to 30% on the right.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate systemic
arterial
hypertension (SBP 174 mm Hg). The left ventricular filling
pressure was
moderately elevated (LVEDP 23 mm Hg). There was no gradient upon

pullback of the catheter from the LV into the aorta.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left main and two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate left renal artery stenosis.

ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to
distal inferolateral wall hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with normal global systolic function. Estimated elevated left
ventricular filling pressures.

Intra-op Echo [**2134-6-14**]
PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being a-paced. There is overall
normal biventricular systolic function. The thoracic aorta
appears intact. No significant change from the pre-bypass study.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old female with history of diabetese c/b foot ulcers,
CHF presents with NSTEMI on POD#1 from skin grafting to right
foot ulcers.  The patient remained on the medicine service for
preoperative Plavix washout.  She did develop some epistaxis.
ENT was consulted.  This resolved with Afrin and pressure.  She
was transferred to cardiac surgery on [**2134-6-14**].  She was brought
to the operating room on [**2134-6-14**] where the patient underwent
CABGx4 as detailed in the operative report.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was used for surgical
antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1 found the patient extubated,
alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  She
did develop hyponatremia, which improved with free water
restriction.  This will be followed by cardiology as an
outpatient.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor
for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  Given her recent skin graft to right foot ulceers-
she is non-weight bearing on the RLE.  She will follow up with
podiatry next week.  By the time of discharge on POD 4, the
sternal wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was disch
