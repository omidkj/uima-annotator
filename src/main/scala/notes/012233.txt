Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Found Down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral CVL line placement
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of insulin dependent
DM, HTN, and cerebrovascular disease who presented after being
found unresponsive at her home and having had a PEA arrest.  The
patient was last seen three days prior to presentation when she
reported feeling somewhat unwell but had no particular
localizing symptoms.  She was not seen in the ensuing days over
the weekend and then today her paperboy noted multiple papers
piled up on the porch.   He called the police who broke into the
house and discovered the patient breathing but minimally
reponsive.  EMS was then called and arrived on the scene found
her in rapid AF with hypotension, intubated the patient in the
field, and brought her to the ED.  En route to the ED the
patient did have a PEA arrest and received epinephrine and
atropine before arriving in the ED where converted to VF,
received one defibrillation attempt, and then another round of
epi/atropine before return of spontaneous circulation though she
was quite hypotensive.  She also received one amp bicarbonate,
six liters of fluid, and was started on phenylephrine.  ET tube
was replaced in ED due to noted abdominal distension and concern
field intubation was esophageal.  PIV placed in the field noted
to be infiltrated with surrounding arm cold.  Labs revealed
leukocytosis to 19.1, lactate of 6.6 and ABG 7.13/65/38.  CT
scan head showed hypoattenuation of the entire left parietal
lobe, CT chest with bilateral pleural effusions/ consolidations
and multiple pulmonary emboli with clot in the left atrial
appendage.  She received vancomycin and pipercillin-tazobactam
for undifferentiated shock.  Cardiology was consulted regarding
atrial fibrillation and recommended against rate control given
it was felt high rate was needed to compensate for poor
contractility post arrest.

Past Medical History:

OTHER RESULTS
==============
Images:
CT spine: No acute fracture or malalignment.
.
CT abdoman/ pelvis:
1. Segmental pulmonary emboli - right and left lower lobes.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and right middle
and lower lobe opacities (infection, atelectasis, aspiration).
3. Cardiomegaly and [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement
4. Clot in left atrial appendage
5. Multiple bilateral rib fractures.
6. Periportal edema and gallstones.
.
CT head:
-Large confluent areas of hypoattenuation involving the entire
left parietal lobe, the left temporal lobe and the right
posterior parietal region -- concerning for diffuse ischemia.
-Local mass effect and sulcal effacemnt - No midline shift or
signs of herniation.
-No ICH or fracture.
.
EKG: afib with RVR


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/oF with insulin dependent DM, afib not coumadin, recent CVA
w/o residual neurologic deficits found unresponsive at home,
likely down time 2-3 days, in afib with RVR c/b PEA arrest en
route to hospital, now intubated, with massive MCA infarcts, LV
thrombus, bilateral PE.

At presentation it was unclear how long the patient had been
immobilized though her lactic acidosis, high CK, and story of
missing multiple papers would suggest a prolonged
incapacitation.  Unclear what was the primary lesion though
given PE, embolic strokes, and clot in left atrial appendage
would suspect widespread embolism from atrial clot with CVA
causing profound alteration in mental status and obtundation.
Patient likely then with secondary rhabdomyolysis and lactic
acidosis from muscle breakdown, poor perfusion, and likely
hypoventilation/poor perfusion.

At time of her arrival patient with no purposeful neurological
activity, posturing and large areas of ischemia from emboli.
She was in severe shock with two pressors required to maintain
blood pressures likely from components of obstructive (secondary
to PE) and distributive (due to acidosis, SIRS) pathology.
Given these factors prognosis was considered to be extremely
poor.  After arrival of the family and discussion of very poor
prognosis they agreed to make the patient DNR/DNI and withdraw
pressors and life sustaining treatments.  She was started on
morphine drip for comfort, extubated, and vasopressors were
stopped.  She passed away < 30 minutes later.  Family refused
autopsy.
