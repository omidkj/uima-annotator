Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Intraoperative hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electrophysiological study


History of Present Illness:
This 65 year old male has non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and an
LVEF between 20-30%. He has a biventricular ICD and has
recurrent ventricular tachycardia despite being treated with
Sotalol. He received a shock from his ICD, last was [**2157-9-8**] for
sustained ventricular tachycardia associated with loss of
conciousness. Multiple morphologies of VT in EP procedure
thought to be [**1-11**] epicardial source. Had labile pressures to
70's systolic that was responsive to pressors (Dopa and Neo),
felt to be secondary to anesthesia. CT Abdomen/Pelvis
preliminary negative for bleed.
On arrival to floor patient was extubated and responsive.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion.

Physical Exam:

Pertinent Results:
CT abd:
IMPRESSION:
1. No radiologic evidence to suggest a cause for sudden
hypotension. In
particular, there is no retroperitoneal bleed seen or hematoma
in the region
of the access site in the right groin.
2. These findings were conveyed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 11 a.m. on
[**2157-10-18**].

[**10-18**] Echo:
LV systolic function appears depressed. The right ventricular
free wall may be hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 YO gentleman with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p ICD with
multiple runs of VT despite sotalol therapy transferred from EP
lab to CCU for labile intraoperative bloop pressures.
.
# PUMP: Hypotension felt to be secondary to anesthesia
medications received during the procedure. Intrabadominal/RP
bleed and pericardial effusion were ruled out by imaging. Pt
initially put on neo drip which was weaned. His pressures
improved and he was hemodynamically stabled by time of
discharge. Lisinopril and carvedilol was initially held and then
resumed.
.
# RHYTHM: Per EP study, VT focus thought to be epicardial. While
epicardial ablation is a possibility, pt clearly has intolerance
to anesthestic medications and would likely need a bypass via
tandem heart to maintain adequate pressures during the surgery.
Thus, pt will be medically managed for now. Medical management
was optimized and patient's sotolol dose was increased from 80mg
[**Hospital1 **] to 120mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt told to follow up with his outpatient EP
cardiologist.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**],

You came to [**Hospital1 **] for a study of your heart to
determine why you were having some dangerous heart rhythms. The
study ruled out one area of your heart causing these rhythms.
Unfortunately, your blood pressure became very low, probably
because of your reaction to the anesthesia. The low blood
pressure meant that one area of your heart could not be checked
to see if it is the source of the dangerous rhythm. To help
control your heart rate and rhythm, we have increased the dose
of your sotalol.

Please increase the dose of sotalol to 120 mg two times a day.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

Followup Instructions:
Patient should follow up with his cardiologist in [**12-11**] weeks.
