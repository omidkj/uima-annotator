shortness of breath

None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 19 year-old Indian with no significant PMH but a
recent diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%,
2D-Echo [**2185-11-15**]), presenting with acute-onset of shortness of
breath for 2-days.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to the
[**Hospital1 1516**]-Cardiology service on [**2185-10-17**] when he presented with
palpitations, dyspnea, some URI symptoms, which was associated
with substernal chest pain, found to have evidence of volume
overload and peripheral edema consistent with decompensated
dilated cardiomyopathy. A 2D-Echo was performed and showed 3+
mitral regurgitation with an LVEF of 15-20%. He was started on a
Nitro gtt and aggressively diuresed, requiring a Lasix gtt with
conversion to PO Torsemide prior to discharge. His weight on
admission was 97 kg (dry weight estimated at 90 kg) and this
improved to 89.8 kg at discharge. In terms of cardiomyopathy
investigation - his HIV, Lyme antibody, CMV, EBV, hepatitis
serologies, TSH and [**Location (un) **] virus testing were all negative.
Of note, the patient has a strong family history of dilated
cardiomyopathy, with two uncles who expired in their 30s from
heart failure. Additions to his medication list at that time
included an ACEI, beta-blocker and spironolactone. He was also
loaded with Digoxin and was uptitrated to 375 mcg PO daily. He
was discharged on [**2185-10-26**]. The patient's 2D-Echo was repeated on
[**2185-10-31**] showed similar findings after initiation medical
therapies.
.
He now presented with shortness of breath while at his
rehabilitation facility the day prior to admission, [**2185-11-12**],
which was occurring at rest and worst with exertion. This was
associated with substernal chest pain that radiated to the right
scalp, worse with deep inspiration and relieved by leaning
forward. He has noted no unintentional weight gain, leg
swelling. He also denied fevers or chills, nausea, palpitations
and diaphoresis. He denies URI symptoms or productive cough or
abdominal pain.
.
In the ED, initial VS 98.1 105 137/79 15 100%RA. His exam was
notable for tachypnea, tachycardia, but no leg swelling or JVP
elevation. His WBC was 21.1 (N 82.9%, L 10.3%), pro-BNP 2968,
Troponin < 0.01. In the ED, his tachypnea progressed and he
required RSI (etomidate, succinylcholine) for airway protection
and increased work of breathing. Cardiology was consulted.
Cardiac U/S in the ED showed no evidence of pericardial
effusion, poor squeeze and a dilated left ventricle. CTA chest
showed small, LLL subsegmental pulmonary embolus with possible
right lung base PNA. Prior to transfer, VS 97.7 100 99/72 22
100% intubated (500/22/5/1.0).
.
In the MICU, patient was started on heparin gtt following bolus
for small, LLL subsegmental pulmonary embolus. They continued
Vancomycin, Cefepime and Levofloxacin for presumed
healthcare-associated pneumonia given CT findings of right lung
base consolidation. Cardiology recommended discontinuing
anti-hypertensives and continuing anticoagulation. He was
extubated on [**11-13**] and his heparin gtt was bridged to Coumadin
with some mild hemoptysis. He spiked a temperature to 101.5F,
developed tachycardia to the 120s and had a repeat 2D-Echo on
[**11-14**] showing right ventricular systolic function that was more
severely impaired when compared to the [**10-31**] study. He developed
intermittent abdominal pain with hyperbilirubinemia and a
moderate transaminitis concerning for cardiogenic hepatic
congestion. A RUQ ultrasound showed prominent hepatic veins,
mild distention of the gallbladder with mild wall thickening and
no gallstones. At this point, his outpatient Cardiologist, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**], recommended transfer to the CCU for IV Lasix and
Milrinone therapy given his biventricular cardiac failure.
.
On arrival to CCU, has some nausea and on-going small volume
hemoptysis but he is without lightheadedness or dizziness. He
denies chest pain or trouble breathing.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative; see HPI for details.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
It is notable for dyspnea on exertion, but no paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. He did notes some orthopnea, but was without
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
