Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Persistent left-sided hip pain s/p DHS [**10-3**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left bipolar hip replacement


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87-year-old female with history of stroke,
depression and dementia related to the stroke. She presents
today after a witnessed physical altercation with her one of her
caregivers ([**Name (NI) **]); this caregiver lives with the patient and she
is being admitted for protection at this point.

She does have a recent diagnosis of severe pain in the left hip
and left knee after a fall in [**9-/2161**] at which time she had a
left hip fracture; this was treated with ORIF. She has had
recurrent severe pain in the left hip. Recently, she was seen by
orthopedist and a total hip replacement was suggested as the
quality of life appears significantly affected by the persistent
left hip pain and knee pain; there was a plan for possible
surgery next week. She finds it aggravating her day-to-day
activities. Even getting out of bed to go to the bathroom now
becomes a major endeavor.


Past Medical History:
-HTN
-GI Bleed--[**2158**], in setting of NSAID use as well as H.Pylori
infection, which was treated. That hospitalization included ICU
admission with multiple PRBC transfusions, several EGDs with
clipping and electrocaudery of bleeding lesion, intubation and
tx for PNA, and IMI that was likely in the setting of anemia.
-CAD--had an elevation in trop in setting of GIB as above (Echo
in [**10-31**] showed preserved EF (55%) with basal inferolateral
hypokinesis and septal apex hypokinesis, and [**11-30**]+ MR)
-CVA--[**10-31**] with L hemiparesis (distal right middle cerebral
artery
lenticulostriate artery infarction)
-Dementia--probable [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body

Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic
function
appears depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include apical hypokinesis/akinesis/dyskinesis; cannot exclude
mid lateral hypokinesis. No left ventricular thrombus
identified; cannot exclude. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic

hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
EF 45%

Brief Hospital Course:
1) HIP:
She was evaluated by the Orthopaedics department and was
consented for surgical correction. On [**2162-8-17**], she was prepped
and brought down to the operating room for surgery.
Intra-operatively, she was closely monitored and was transfused
3 units of PRBC intraoperatively and remained hemodynamically
stable. She tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty
or complication. Post-operatively, she was extubated and
transferred to the PACU for further stabilization and
monitoring. She was then transferred to the floor for further
recovery. On the floor, her was hypotensive (BP-80's) and low
UOP. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring. In
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was transfused 2 units of PRBC for postoperative
anemia and remained stable afterwards. She then remained
hemodynamically stable with her pain controlled. She was again,
transferred to the floor. On the floor, she was noticed to have
persistent internal rotation of her left hip. An Xray done 1
week after surgery showed a re-dislocation of the hip
prosthesis.  She was taken back to the OR for a open reduction.
She will follow up with the Orthopedic team as an outpatient.
She will continue on prophylactic Lovenox for a total of 3 weeks
per Ortho team.
.
2) PNEUMONIA:
Also developed hosp acquired pneumonia - zosyn and vanc started.
 PNA improved with no fevers/ SOB/Cough.  Completed course of
antibiotics.  No further fevers.
.
3) ARF:
Developed ARF (cr 0.5 --> 1.3 ) - u. eos + --> doubt vanc/zosyn.
Could be from lisinopril that was started 2 days before the ARF
developed.  Vanco also stopped and creatinine trended down back
to baseline so that may have been etiology.
.
4) NSTEMI:
5 days post-op had dislocated hip again - was planning to go to
OR - but had new ST changes that AM; hence did not go to OR
(given not an emergent surgery). Enzymes showed NSTEMI which was
medically managed.  Pt did not have any angina with this.
Enzymes trended down.  Pt did then return to the OR for
reduction and did not have any cardiac complications from that
surgery.  Started on beta blocker and captopril which have been
titrated up to acheive BP/HR control.  These should be continued
to be titrated as an outpatient.  Statin and ASA added.
.
5) CHF:
Exam and CXR show pulmonary edema, likely due fluids received
for post-op hypotension and MI.  She has been gently diuresed as
renal function was up.  Has improved but still requires further
diuresis.  EF 45%.
.
6) DEMENTIA:  Has baseline [**Last Name (un) **] body dementia.  Seen by
geriatrics.  On seroquel and aricept.
.
7) C DIFF COLITIS:  About 2 weeks in to hospital course,
developed cdiff and started on flagyl.  She will be discharged
on PO Flagyl to complete a total of a 10 day course.
.
8) UTI:  Treated with zosyn which she was on for pna.
