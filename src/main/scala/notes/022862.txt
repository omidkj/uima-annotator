Right sided PICC line
Left-sided thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
43 year old male with no significant PMH who p/w 2 weeks of
malaise, myalgias, fevers/chills. Over this time period he was
seen at multiple EDs ([**Hospital3 **], [**Hospital3 **], [**Hospital1 112**]) for
dehydration/viral illness:
[**2-18**]: seen at [**Hospital3 **], found to have a clear CXR, WBC 5,
HCT 39 and Cr 1.1.  Given fluids.  Prescribed cipro, took it QD
x5 days.
[**2-20**]: seen at New [**University/College **], flu swab negative, again given
fluids.
[**2-22**]: seen at [**Hospital1 112**], negative orthostatics.
.
As above, patient had malaise, myalgias, headaches and episodes
of the 'shivers.' He noted decreased POs and fluids, as well as
episodes of confusion.  He notes dark urine and decreased urine
output.  He did endorse some diarrhea and later some lower
abdominal pain.  He denies cough/congestion though he endorsed
this elsewhere in the chart.  He denies sore throat or runny
nose. He has had no recent travel outside of [**Location (un) 511**], no
dental procedures, no unusual foods, no pets, denies IVDU.  He
does have a co-worker with recent bronchitis.
.
ED Course: VS on arrival: t 97.2, HR 100, BP 134/64, RR 17, SPO2
97%.  Patient had BUN 159 and Cr of 7.1; U/A showed casts, large
leuk and blood, few bacteria, 100 protein.  Patient received 6L
IVF with minimal urine output.
.
Pt c/o SOB with O2 saturation in mid 90s, found to have mild end
expiratory wheeze.  Repeat CXR showed persistent left lower lobe
atelectasis, new left mid lobe atelectasis, small left effusion
and new interstitial edema.  Looked like fluid overload (had
gotten 6L IVF for ARF), received neb and Lasix 20mg IV --> put
out 200 cc urine and felt better.
.
He was seen by renal team, found to have an active urine
sediment with WBC/RBC casts and bacteria.  Initially thought to
have post-strep or post-viral glomerulernephritis, and due to
this concern he received a renal biopsy.  Soon after this he
spiked a temperature to 102.8, with tachycardia in 120's,
tachypnea and rigors.  Blood cultures revealed 4/4 bottles with
GPC.  He received Cipro 500mg PO, Vancomycin 1gm IV. BP range
106-142/50-60s.
.
Patient was then sent to the MICU for close observation before
transfer to floor.

Past Medical History:
No known PMH, has not had medical care in many years.

Blood Bank Diagnosis of new Big E antigen:
DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a new
diagnosis
of Anti-E antibody. E-antigen is a member of the Rhesus blood
group
systems. Anti-E antibody is clinically significant and capable
of
causing hemolytic transfusion reactions.
In the future, Mr. [**Known lastname **] should receive E-antigen negative
products for
all red cell transfusions. Approximately 71% of ABO compatible
blood
will be E-antigen negative. A wallet card and a letter stating
the
above information will be sent to the patient.

chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three
