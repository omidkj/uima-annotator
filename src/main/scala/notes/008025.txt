Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Coronary artery Bypass Grafting /Aortic Valve
Replacement(Left internal mammary artery grafted to left
anterior descending artery. Saphenous vein grafted to Obtuse
Marginal/Right coronary artery)/ (#21mm [**Doctor Last Name **] tissue Aortic

History of Present Illness:
73 year old man with past medical history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, chronic atrial fibrillation, referred for
cardiac catherization for evaluation
of coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.  The patient
presented with chest pain in the setting of rapid atrial
fibrillation, and was found to have positive cardiac biomarkers
at OSH as well as severe atrial stenosis on echocardiography
with estimated valve area of 0.5 cm2 and EF 60%. Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath which revealed CAD. Csurg was consulted
for evaluation for AVR/CABG.  He underwent dental extractions
[**2194-3-6**] in preparation for
surgery.  He was then transferred to rehab for antibiotic
therapy for lower leg cellulitis.  He was treated with
Vancomycin and Cipro and was eventually discharged to home.  He
was home for 9 days and then was found to have a UTI by his PCP
and was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**4-14**] and was treated
with Imipenem. His foley was changed and he was sent back to
rehab on [**4-18**] and
was transferred here today for surgery in the morning.  He had a
power PICC placed last week.  He had a negative urine culture
on[**4-21**].


Past Medical History:
- Hypertension
- Chronic atrial fibrillation, on aspirin and not anticoagulated
[**1-7**] recurrent epistaxis on warfarin
- Diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 60%)
- Aortic stenosis
- H/o cervical fracture age 29 s/p C3-5 laminectomy, resulting
in mild atony of LE muscles and neurogenic bladder, with
indwelling Foley catheter x5 years
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Benign prostatic hyperplasia
- Multiple UTIs
- CKD stage I-II
- S/p skin cancer resection left shoulder 6 years ago
- BLE draining cellulitis x 3-4 weeks

Social History:
Lives in [**Hospital1 1474**] alone, [**Last Name (un) **] lives in the area and helps with
care. Married 30 years. No children. was a truck driver for some
time and then did consulting at [**Hospital6 33**]. School
through 8th grade. Smoked until [**2149**] (3 pack daily). No illicit
drugs. EtOH: Pt endorses drinking whiskey in the past, but not
so far this century.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. Father with Peripheral vascular disease leading
to bilateral amputation at 71, CVA at 72. Mother with HTN died
at 84 secondary to complication of CVA.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed

regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 - 45 %), with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
Patient is AV-Paced, on low dose Phenylephrine.
Good biventricular systolic fxn. EF now 45 - 50%.
Prosthetic aortic valve is in place with no leak and no AI. Mean
residual gradient = 9 mmHg.
MR is 1+ - 2+.
Aorta intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2194-4-29**] 4:45 PM
Final Report CHEST RADIOGRAPH
INDICATION: Status post CABG and thoracocentesis.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the signs of
pulmonary
edema have decreased. Nonetheless, small bilateral pleural
effusions are
still seen. In almost unchanged manner, a retrocardiac
atelectasis is shown.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, the venous introduction
sheath is in unchanged position.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
