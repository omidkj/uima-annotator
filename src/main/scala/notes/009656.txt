Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
78 yo M with h/o severe AS (valve area 0.6) currently awaiting
AVR, CAD, and diastolic CHF presenting with shortness of breath
that began yesterday evening.  He has been experiencing DOE for
the past year but has never experienced symptoms at rest before.
 He reports that in the last three days, he has had two meals of
Chinese food as well as soup and a sub.  He has noted that his
feet have been more swollen in the past few days and he was
unable to lay flat overnight.  He did not experience chest pain
or pressure and did not feel that his heart was racing.
.
He was scheduled to undergo AVR in [**2-/2180**], but this was placed
on hold due to an unexplained leukocytosis.  During his pre-op
workup, he noted pain and a "bump" in his right sholder/axilla.
He recently underwent a skin biopsy and ultrasound guided LN
biospy which was c/w melanoma.  He is currently followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 519**].  The full work up and management plan of his melanoma is
pending.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were 99.6 108 118/77 22 97%.  He
was noted to be in afib with rates in the 100s.  He was
reportedly tachypneic with oxygen stats in the 90s without
improvement from nasal cannula.  He was palced on BIPAP with
improvedment in his sats.  His CXR was c/w pulmonary edema for
which he was given lasix 20 mg IV x1, but unfortunately UOP was
not recorded.  A bedside echo reportedly did not reveal bowing
and a CTA was negative for PE.  His troponin was negative x1.
.
He was given metoprolol 2.5 mg IV x2, without significant
improvement in his rhythm or his rate.  His BP remained
borderline stable, reportedly ranging from 90s-100s systolic.
He was admitted to the CCU for further management and
monitoring.

[**4-6**] MR HEAD
1. No evidence of metastatic disease to the brain.
2. Abnormal signal at the level of the posterior aspect of the
clivus as well as involving the dens and C2 vertebral body
suspicious for metastatic disease.

[**4-5**] CTA CHEST
1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic
pathology.
2. Interval increase in size of the right axillary mass,
multiple mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules,
concerning for metastatic disease.
3. Extensive calcification in the aortic annulus, likely
resulting in aortic stenosis. Severe coronary arterial
calcification. Bilateral small pleural effusions with bibasal
opacities, which may represent infection or aspiration.

[**4-5**] URINE CYTOLOGY - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo M with severe AS (valve area of 0.6) awaiting AVR, known
afib (previously on warfarin/now on lovenox), dCHF and recently
diagnosed melanoma presenting with acute onset of shortness of
breath at rest.

# Dyspnea / Acute on chronic diastolic CHF:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4223**] admits to occasional dietary indescretions leading
to heart failure exacerbations, and most recently over the
weekend he had chinese food.  He was noted on admission CXR to
have pulmonary edema with bibasilar crackles on exam. He was
diuresed gently with PRN lasix throughout his hospital stay, to
avoid significant preload reductions. His dyspnea improved with
continued diuresis and he was discharged home on 40mg lasix PO
daily.

# Critical aortic stenosis
Valve area of 0.6 with gradients around 40. He had been
scheduled to undergo a valve repair, but this was held due to
his leukocytosis. Further evaluation revealed melanoma and a
large axillary mass of unknown etiology. Given his poor
prognosis if he does have metastatic disease, the decision was
made to pursue symptomatic treatment of his AS with
valvuloplasty. He was discharged home with plan to return on
Monday to the cath lab for valvuloplasty.

# Melanoma
He recently underwent a skin biopsy which was consistent with
melanoma. He is currently followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**]. He also
underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of an axillary lymph node.
The preliminary path results suggest that this is not melanoma,
but may be a sarcoma. Results were still pending on discharge.
When the path results are finalized, further decisions regarding
his oncologic treatment will be addressed. A CTA showed interval
enlargement of the axillary lymph node, as well as possible lung
mets.

# Atrial fibrillation with borderline RVR
He had previously been treated with atenolol. His atrial fib was
challenging to control over the course of the hospitalization.
He had initially presented to the ED with rates in the 110s. He
received IV metoprolol with  modest control. He had recurrent
episodes of HRs to the 130s and was controlled with metoprolol,
eventually discharged on metoprolol 25mg TID and diltiazem 30mg
QID. His warfarin had been switched to lovenox pending surgery,
but these were stopped for his planned valvuloplasty on
discharge.

# CAD:
Pt is s/p MI in [**2169**] and [**2177**], most recent PCI in [**2177**] (BMS).
His cath from [**2-/2180**] revealed mild stable CAD.  Pt denies CP
during this admission. With negative troponins and no evidence
of ischemia on ECG. Continued aspirin.
.
# Leukocytosis:
The patients WBC count continues to rise.  He denies recent
fevers.  He was recently evaluated by ID, but the etiology of
his rising white count remains unclear.  His differential is
currently left shifted without abnormal cells noted.  Unlikely
to be caused by his recently dx malignancy and there is no
current evidence
