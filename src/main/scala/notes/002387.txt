CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 58-year-old
morbidly obese man with diabetes type 2, CAD status post
multiple MIs, stents, prior V-fib arrest x2 resident at
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital Rehab had hemodialysis as usual
on [**2173-12-18**].

Date prior to admission, complained of GI distress treated
with Reglan.  Day of admission was found with malaise,
shaking chills, hypotensive with temperature of 99.1, blood
pressure 60/palp, heart rate in the 120s, O2 saturation 97%,
and he denied chest pain.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for workup
for hypotension.

On admission, he denied chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, and fatigue.

Past hospitalizations:  [**2173-8-12**] to [**2173-9-20**] V-fib arrest,
Clostridium difficile colitis, MRSA, VRE bacteremia,
aspiration pneumonia.  On [**2173-9-23**] acute pulmonary edema.  He
has also had a history of mid LAD instent thrombosis status
post re-stented, intubation complicated by failure to wean
requiring tracheostomy, Citrobacter, and VRE bacteremia,
Pseudomonas, and Citrobacter, ventilator-associated
pneumonia, meropenem desensitization, ATN leading to renal
failure, sepsis from Pseudomonas, VRE, and Citrobacter.  VRE
bacteremia, Pseudomonas infection of bladder, bacteremia,
tracheitis.  Urticaria from an allergic reaction to Zosyn.
Pseudomonas found later to be associated with pneumonia and
Zosyn desensitization, meropenem desensitization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CAD status post MI in '[**60**], '[**67**], '[**68**], [**2171**], and [**2172**].

8. CHF due to systolic dysfunction.
9. Clostridium difficile colitis.
10. MRSA bacteremia.

12. End-stage renal failure on dialysis from diabetes and
ATN.
13. Anxiety.

Distant regular heart rate.  Chest:  Right PICC and dialysis
catheter without erythema or discharge.  Abdomen is soft,
obese, and nontender, positive bowel sounds, incontinent of
stool.  Trace edema on extremities.  Neurologic:  Awake with
occasional slurring, lethargic, conversant with 1-2 words at
a time, moves all four extremities to command.

EKG paced at 94, unchanged since [**2173-11-4**].

Chest x-ray:  No infiltrate, no failure, right PICC up
towards right IJ, right dialysis catheter in place, trache,
pacer wires from the left.

LABORATORIES:  White count 23, hematocrit 33, platelets 223.
Creatinine 4.6.  Troponin 0.21, INR of 1.3.  Lactate of 7.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
1. ID:  Sepsis.  Patient had multiple possible sources for
sepsis, most likely is Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer
approximately 30 x 30 x 20 cm in dimension draining liquid
stool.  Question of rectal fistula as possible etiology or
osteo.

Patient also had possibly UTI.  Other etiologies include
lines and catheters, pneumonia which although not appreciated
radiographically still in the differential as well as
Clostridium difficile colitis currently on Vancomycin with
watery stools.  He was continued on meropenem, linezolid, and
p.o. Vancomycin for empiric coverage for Pseudomonas, VRE,
MRSA, and Clostridium difficile.  He received one dose of
gentamicin.  Cultures were obtained.  He was continued on the
antibiotics.

2. Cardiac:  Patient was hypotensive.  History of ischemic
cardiomyopathy.  He was enrolled in the ........ protocol.
He received 6 liters of fluid.  Initially, the patient was
anuric.  His blood pressure continued to drop over the course
of his hospitalization.  His CVP had remained between 10 and
15.  He was started on pressors.  He was started first on
Neo-Synephrine then Levophed, and vasopressin, and dobutamine
with little response.  His mixed venous O2 was 71%.  His
troponins trended down from 0.21 to 0.19, and patient's
lactate continued to rise to a high of 14.4 over the course
of his hospitalization.

3. CAD:  He was continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.
His beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were held.  For V-fib, he
was continued on his amiodarone.

4. Pulmonary:  His ventilatory status was stable on
admission.  He was placed on CPAP and pressure supports 10
and 5.  The patient over his hospitalization, he had acute
respiratory distress likely flash pulmonary edema, was
changed to assist control with improvement of his ventilation
and respiratory status.  He did, however, continue to become
progressively acidotic with severe lactic acidosis.

5. Renal:  He was hydrated.  No hemodialysis due to his
hypotension.  He had an anion gap acidosis secondary to
hyperperfusion and lactic acidosis.

6. Code:  Patient was initially admitted as full code.
Daughter, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who is the healthcare proxy after
multiple discussions with the daughter over the course of his
hospitalization, given his status as well as his poor
prognosis, patient was made CMO on [**2173-12-21**] at 9 a.m.
Patient was pronounced on [**2173-12-21**] at 10:20 a.m.  No autopsy
was to be done per the daughter.
