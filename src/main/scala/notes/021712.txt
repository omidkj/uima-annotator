HEENT: WNL

in place. Sub Q air noted
COR: tacycardic S1, S2

Pertinent Results:
chest CT [**2103-9-14**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate left pneumothorax with two chest tubes in place. The
lower of the two left chest tubes abuts the pericardial surface
during part of its course and also traverses the left major
fissure before terminating just above the diaphragm.

2. Multifocal pneumonia superimposed upon severe emphysema, with
consolidation, most pronounced in the left lower lobe.
Aspiration pneumonia should be considered.

3. Spiculated 1.9 cm diameter nodule in right upper lobe.
Although possibly related to the multifocal infection, the
morphology is concerning for a primary bronchogenic carcinoma.
Followup CT in 6 to 8 weeks after completion of antibiotic
therapy is recommended.

4. Small pleural effusions.

5. Diffuse subcutaneous emphysema and a small amount of
pneumomediastinum.


Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admiited to the general surgical floor w/ 2 left chest
tubes to sxn. He quickly developed increased resp distress, use
of accessory muscles and was transfered to the ICU for Bipap
(w/o peep d/t PTX). He was also given IV steroids and broad
spectrum IVAB.
A lengthy discussion was had with the patient regarding his
overall prognosis and he was made DNR/DNI in accordance with his
wishes.
A talc pleurdesis was performed on [**2103-9-15**].
Pt's resp status continued to decline over the next 3 days and
after a family meeting, a decision was made to pursue comfort
care.  A palliative care consult was obtained and pt was started
on a morphine drip. Pt subsequently expired comforatbly in the
company of his family on [**2103-9-18**].

 The following is a note from [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 952**]:

I am sad to inform you that Mr. [**Known firstname 68449**] [**Known lastname 24397**] died on [**2103-9-18**] from respiratory failure.  After arriving at the [**Hospital1 1444**], he was thoroughly evaluated by
our pulmonary service as well as myself.  Unfortunately, he did
not meet any criteria for lung volume reduction surgery, nor did
he have an area of isolated blebs that could be resected to
eliminate his air leak and improve respiratory biomechanics.  We
therefore performed a talc pleurodesis which solved the pleural
leak, and we were able to remove his chest tubes.  Within a few
days, however, it was obvious that he would likely never leave
the intensive care unit given his end-stage COPD.  After a long
discussion with his family and the multidisciplinary team caring
for him, all were in agreement that we should allow him to pass
peacefully as was his wish.  Therefore, in the presence of his
family, he died on [**2103-9-18**].

Once again, thank you for allowing us to participate in his
care.

Sincerely,

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 951**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 952**] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD
