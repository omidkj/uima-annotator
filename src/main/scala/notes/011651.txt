Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented for elective removal of her gallbladder on
[**2190-1-6**].  She was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy.  However, due to difficulties with retraction
and adhesion with the laparoscopic approach, it was converted to
an open cholecystectomy.  The operation took approximately 4
hours total and proceeded without complication.  Please refer to
Dr.[**Name (NI) 1863**] operative summary for additional details.

Post-operatively, a foley catheter was placed with good urine
output >500 cc.  She was sent to the PACU in stable condition.
She was transferred to the ICU for further post-operative
monitoring.

Overnight into POD 1, the patient's urine output faced a sharp
decline, trending to zero.  Given her 7L positive fluid status
she was given one dose of albumin on transfer to the ICU.  Urine
output failed to increase substantially.  Her Cr at this point
was 1.2 and increased in the morning to 1.7, peaked at 1.9.
Hyperkalemia was treated and trending down.  Seen by renal
service and given lasix 160 mg in PM of POD 1 then 80 mg on POD
2 AM.  Urine output picked up to 3L.

Her oxygen requirement increased on the AM of POD 1, requiring
intubation later that day. Over the next 24 hours, she was
aggressively diuresed and weaned to CPAP. Her Cr returned to
baseline of 0.8 and her urine output was excellent. She was
weaned to CPAP and extubated on POD#2. With aggressive chest PT,
pulmonary toilet, and physical therapy, she was weaned to 5L NC
with good O2 sats by POD#4. She tolerated a regular diet and her
incision was healing well. She was transferred to the floor on
poD#5.

On the floor her vital signs were routinely monitored and she
remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Her oxygen
saturation was routinely monitored and her supplemental oxygen
was weaned from 5 L to 3 L NC. She remained without respiratory
compromise and continued with incentive spirometry and pulmonary
toileting. Her diet was slowly advanced starting on POD#5, and
by discharge she was tolerating a regular diet without
nausea/vomiting. She was also started on a bowel regimen to
avoid constipation. Her foley catheter remained in place with
adequate urine output. Her electrolytes were monitored and
repleted as needed. She remained without leukocytosis or
evidence of infection.

Overnight on POD#5 she began to express suicidal ideation.
Psychiatry was consulted, and upon initial evaluation it was
thought that she was actively suicidal and section 12 was
initiated.  Suicide precautions were maintained with a 1:1
sitter. However, upon later re-evaluation on POD#6, it became
clear that she was not actively suicidal and that some of her
behavior and statements may have been related to delirium
related to pain/medications/hypoxia. Suicide precautions and
section 12 were removed and she remained without evidence of
suicidal ideation for the remainder of her hospitalization.

On POD#7, she remained hemodynamically stable without evidence
of infection. She was tolerated a regular diet and her urine
output remained adequate. Her mental status was clear and she
denied suicidal ideation. She was discharged to her nursing
facility with follow up scheduled in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic on [**2190-1-28**].
