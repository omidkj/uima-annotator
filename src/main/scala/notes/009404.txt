[**2196-10-20**] ECHO
Pre Bypass:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF=20 %). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the ascending and
descending aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Post Bypass:
Left ventricular function is improved. The EF is now around 30%.
The motion of the lateral and anterolateral walls is improved.
Mild MR and mild AI remain. The calculated aortic valve area is
similar. The aorta is intact.
