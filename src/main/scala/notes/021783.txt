Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**9-10**] and underwent cardiac
catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system and severe three vessel disease. The LMCA had severe
diffuse disease with 70% stenosis in the mid vessel. The D1 had
70% stenosis at the mid segment. The LCX had severe diffuse 80%
stenosis proximally and 70% stenosis distally after the OM2
takeoff. The RCA was not evaluated due to known total
occlusiosn. The aortography revealed 4+ aortic insufficiency.
Based on the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted and
further evaluation was performed. Underwent AVR/CABG X3 / IABP
placement on [**9-12**] and transferred to CSRU in stable condition.
(Chart from [**9-10**] to [**9-19**] is missing - medical records was
notified ).IABP was removed in the unit postoperatively.He spent
several additional days in the CSRU for management of diuresis
and rhythm. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed after the
patient transferred to the floor. He continued to work on
ambulation and pulmonary toilet while remaining in atrial
fibrillation over the next several days. Adjustments were made
in his BP meds and to optimize diuresis. He was restarted on
coumadin with goal INR 2.0-2.5. On day of discharge [**9-26**] (please
see exam), INR 3.2, so coumadin dose for today will be held. Pt.
