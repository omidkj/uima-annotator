Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
61 yo male with PMH HIV on HAART (CD4 224, [**8-20**]), HCV, rectal
adenocarcinoma stage 2 (s/p LAR [**5-19**]) transferred to CCU after
acute syncopal episode with elevated cardiac enzymes and severe
cardiomyopathy. Pt states that he has had several episodes of
lightheadedness and falling without LOC over the past week.
First episodes occurred several days ago while gardening. Pt
states that episodes are triggered by bending his head. Pt
denies CP, SOB, diaphoresis prior to episode. Pt had episodes of
likely LOC 3 days prior to admission and night before admission.
Pt states that the night before admission, he was standing in
his kitchen when his wife found him on the ground. He does not
recall any prodromal symptoms. When he came to, he did not feel
nauseous but felt briefly confused. On day of admission, pt
states he experienced [**6-25**] substernal chest tightness without
radiation, with mild SOB and no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis.
Pain lasted continously from 8am to 1pm, when he went to see his
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he was walking to his PCP's office, he syncopized and
fell on his face. Denies prodromal symptoms or witnessed seizure
activity.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without
complaints of chest pain. Found to have EKG changes with SR,
LVH, with new ST depressions in V5-6. Pt was given Aspirin,
heparin, Metoprolol. Pt's BP dropped from systolic 130s to
80-90s after Metoprolol. Pt was seen by cardiology fellow who
performed an echo which found a severely depressed EF of [**9-30**]%,
4+MR, 4+TR, [**1-18**]+ AI, with all 4 [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] dilated. Pt also had a
negative head CT, no fractures on cervical CT. Pt presented with
right periorbital echymosis and edema; orbital CT showed
multiple fractures. Pt was evaluated by oromaxilofacial surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Pt is s/p NSTEMI with peak CK of 620, peak Tn of 2.18.
Pt was continued on aspirin. Initially, heparin was started, but
was discontinued since pt has Hep C cirrhosis with coagulopathy.
Baseline LFTs were sent off and pt was started on Lipitor.
Lipitor was also discontinued in the setting of pt's liver
disease. Beta-blocker and ACEI were initially held in the
setting of hypotension in the ED. On HD4, small doses of ACEi
and beta-blocker were started.  Catheterization was defered in
setting of initial fever and elevated creatinine.  Cardiac
catheterization performed on [**11-14**] showed three vessel coronary
artery disease w/ chronic RCA occlusion and mild to moderate
diastolic dysfunction.  Patient beta-blocker and ACEi were
increased in dosage and follow up appointments were made with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9625**] within in a week post discharge and cardiology.
.
2. Pump: Pt has severe dilated cardiomyopathy with severely
depressed EF of 20%. Etiologies of cardiomyopathy include HIV,
multivessel CAD, infectious. Initially, pt was felt to be volume
overloaded since he had elevated JVP. Pt was given Lasix 10mg
without any significant urine output. Foley was placed with
adequate urine output noted. On HD 3, pt became hypotensive to
50-60s. Given several IVF boluses without improvement in BP.
Dopa started and levo was added. Swan was placed and initial
numbers were suggestive by not completely consistent with
sepsis, since the pt has a low SVR and normal CI on 2 pressors.
It was thought that pt may be septic and Neo was started;
Dopamine and Levophed were subsequently discontinued. Pt was
also started on empiric vancomycin and zosyn. Repeat swan
numbers showed decreased CI and significantly elevated SVR. Neo
was discontinued on HD4, with maintenance of normal blood
pressures. Transient hypotension was most likely secondary to
volume depletion. On HD4, pt was restarted on ACEi and BB.
Incidentally, it was noted that pt's fluctuations in mental
status seems to correlate with blood pressures. Pt appeared more
alert with BP >120s and appeared more lethargic and confused
with BP in 100-110s. Goal BP was set at >120. On HD5, pt was
started on longer active ACEi, lisinopril 2.5mg and continued on
coreg 3.125.  Catheterization showed diastolic dysfunction.
This was attributed to cardiomyopathy secondary to the patinet's
HIV infection.  His systloiuc blood pressure became persistenty
elevated to the 160's between [**Date range (1) 14898**].  As a result his
Lisionpril was increased to 10 mg daily and his Carvedilol was
increased to 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
3. Rhythm: Pt is at high risk of arrythmia given his severe
cardiomyopathy. Found to be hyperkalemic and given kayexalate
with normalization of potassium.  Pt heart rhythm remained
stable without any acute issues on telemetry throughout rest of
hospitalization.
.
4. Valvular disease: Pt had 3+ MR, 3+ TR, [**12-17**]+ AI. Possible
etiology of valvular disease is secondary to dilated
cardiomyopathy. Pt was restarted on ACEI for afterload
reduction.
.
5. Syncope: Unclear etiology. Differential diagnosis includes
ischemia, arrythmia, valvular disease, cardiomyopathy,
neurological causes, vasovagal. Most likely cardiovascular
cuases include valvular disease and severe cardiomyopathy. Pt
was not found to be orthostatic, but orthostasis is a good
possibility. From a neurological standpoint: History is not
consistent with seizure. Head CT was negative for stroke. On
HD1, during the evening, pt had several episodes of brief
unresponsiveness. During these episodes, pt appeared purple,
eyes deviated upwards, at one point looked like he was choking.
Pt responded to stimulation. Afterwards, pt had mild, transient
confusion. Neuro was consulted about the etiology of syncope and
felt that it was most likely cardiac or orthostasis. EEG was
negative. MRI of the brain showed signs of HIV encephalopathy,
but no acute changes. Patient was instructed to follow up with
PCP in one week to arrange tilt table test.
.
6. s/p fall/Orbital fractures: Cervical CT showed no spinal
fractures. Orbital CT showed multiple right-sided orbital facial
fractures. Orofacialmaxillary surgery was consulted. Pt was
managed conservatively per the recommendation of OFM surgery.
.
7. ID: Pt initially presented with fevers. These are most likely
secondary to local periorbital blood/fluid collection and
possible sinusitis. Antibiotics were
