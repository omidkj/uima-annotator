History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77 yo man with pmhx CAD s/p CABG (4v disease,
unknown anatomy), PVd s/p atherectomy, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, 2nd
degree AV block s/p PMP who p/w one month of progressive dyspnea
on exertion. Of note, last week the patient had one episode of
epistaxis and melena which has since resolved. He went to his
PCP who checked [**Name Initial (PRE) **] crit and found it to be 32 which was 5 points
lower than [**Month (only) **] when it was at baseline 37. He was guaic
negative in ED and reported that his last BM was brown. He did
have some blood on tissue when he wiped. Patient has also had a
mildly productive cough for the last month, but denies sick
contacts, fevers, chills. He sleeps with 2 pillows because he
feels more comfortable, denies PND. Has LE edema at baseline
that he doesnt feel is worse over the last month. Denies calf
pain and no recent plane trips. He reports that over the last
month his dyspnea on exertion has worsened to the point that he
can't walk up a flight of stairs without getting short of breath
which is new for him. He denies any associated chest pain,
palpatations, N/V/D associated with the sob. Of note, he has
never experienced chest pain even before he had his CABG.

The patient had a chest film in the ED that revealed some mild
edema for which the patient received 20mg IV lasix. The patient
additionally received neb treatments given evidence of
bronchospasm on exam and history of significant COPD.

Of additional note lab values in the ED revealed flat CKs but an
elevated troponin of .76, increased from previous values of .23
-.34 in [**2130-6-17**] in the setting of impaired but stable renal
function ( creatinine 1.3, BL 1.1-1.4).

ECG was performed revealing V-pacing without significant change
from previous. The patient last had an echocardiogram performed
in [**2130-4-17**] revealing mildly depressed EF without focal WMA
although limited in view, as well as diastolic dysfunction.

In the ED the patient received ASA, Plavix 75mg, Lipitor 80mg. A
heparin gtt was not started given initial concern for GI
bleeding and impression that symptoms were not escalating to
suggest ACS. A beta blocker was not administered given history
of significant bronchospasm (Dilt as outpatient).

iron studies: TIBC 347, ferritin 37, iron 21, TRF 267

PT 13.5, PTT 27.5, INR 1.2

CXR: Findings consistent with CHF. Bilateral pleural effusions,
left greater than right.

Cardiac Cath:

1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevation of right and left filling pressures with low
cardiac index.
3. Unsuccessful PCI of the ramus intermedius.

Echo:

The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
0-5mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There  is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis  of the distal half of the
septum. The remaining segments contract well.

The  right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are  moderately thickened but aortic valve
stenosis is not suggested. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild tricuspid
stenosis (area >1.5cm2). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-4-17**],
distal septal hypokinesis is now suggested (may be related to
IVCD as also suggested on
prior study) and the right ventricular cavity now appears
dilated. Trace
aortic regurgitation was present on review of the prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: A/P: Patient is a 77 year old Male with history of CAD s/p
4V CABG in [**2118**] who presents with 1 month of worsening DOE with
intial concern for GI bleeding, but subsequently found to have
elevated Troponin and ruled in for NSTEMI.
.
# DOE - Troponin elevated despite stable renal function. On
admission, the patient appeared to be clinically mildly fluid
overloaded which would not completely account for the
significantly elevated troponin. Patient ruled in for NSTEMI.
Patient was taken to cath lab:
.
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevation of right and left filling pressures with low
cardiac index.
3. Unsuccessful PCI of the ramus intermedius.
.
Given his low CI and high filling pressures and hypotension post
cath, he was sent to the CCU where he underwent diuresis with
stable BP.
.
Anemia was felt to be contributing to his symptoms. Earlier this
month, patient had a hematocrit of 44 at PCPs office and on
admission it was 31. Patient had brown guaic positive stool. He
was transfused one unit of blood and his hematocrit responded
appropriately.
.
COPD could also be contributing to his dyspnea and his
breathlessness improved with nebulizer treatments and advair, as
well as with the above diuresis.
.
# CAD- see above. We continued asa, atorvastatin, diovan. Plavix
held for GIB and diovan held for elevated creatinine initially.
These were subsequently added back.
.
# GI bleed / blood loss anemia- patient reported to have
epistaxis and dark stools one week ago. Had guaic positive stool
on this admission. Transfused one unit with appropriate crit
bump to get crit over 30 in setting of nstemi. We also started
protonix.   Pt was told to pursue outpatient GI follow-up and
colonoscopy.
.
# COPD - advair, nebs prn given.
.
# HTN- we held diovan initailly given rising creatinine; added
back prior to discharge. We continued Diltiazem 60mg qid,
converted back to SR on discharge. We gave nitropaste for
further afterload reduction.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - we continued atorvastatin
