being defibrillated x2 by EMS with return of sinus rhythm.  He
got 1 round of epi and lidocaine and was intubated for
unreponsiveness.  He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where he was
loaded with amiodarone 150mg and started on a drip.  He was in
stable condition and extubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evalution and treatment.

Chest CT:
1. Densely calcified aortic valve with ascending aortic
calcifications as described above
2. Left apical ground-glass opacity, could be infectious,
attention on followup is recommended.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Small right pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis.
5. Mild emphysema and pulmonary nodules measuring up to 5 mm. A
6 month follow-up is recommended.

ECHO:
PREBYPASS Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild inferior wall hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results at the time of the study.

POSTBYPASS The patient is AV-paced on a phenylephrine infusion.
A new bioprosthetic aortic valve is seen. It appears well
seated. There is mild aortic regurgitation. Residual peak/mean
gradients are 10/6 mmHg respectively. Inferior wall hypokinesis
persists but overall left ventricular systolic function
continues to be normal (LVEF>55%). Trivial mitral regurgitation
and moderate tricuspid regurgitation remain. The thoracic aorta
is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28045**] is an 82 year old male with Coronary artery disease
s/p CABG in [**2142**], (LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to the
ramus intermedius and posterolateral branch of the circumflex),
pacemaker placement for CHB after CABG, HTN, severe aortic
stenosis who presents after witnessed VF arrest that occurred
while walking up stairs at a funeral. He was treated with
defibrillation x3, epi, lidocaine and taken to OSH then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluaution. He has known severe aortic
stenosis. Pre-op ECHO revealed Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2). A
cardiac cath revealed patent bypass grafts. Pre-operative work
up was completed and Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 28044**] was taken to the operating room
on [**2153-8-16**] where he underwent AVR (#23mm [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial).
Please refer to Dr[**Doctor Last Name **] operative report for further details.
Post operatively he was admitted to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. He awoke neurologically intact and was weaned from
the ventilator and extubated with out difficulty. He was started
on betablockers,aspirin, statin and diuresed toward his pre-op
weight. Post operative his permanent pacemaker was functioning
well and his temporary pacing wires and chest tubes were removed
per protocol. He was evaulated by physical therpay for strength
and conditioning. Mr. [**Known lastname 28045**] was cleared for discharge to home
with VNA services on POD#4. Follow up appointments were advised.
