Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**]
Chief Complaint:
Slurred speech, nausea, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 53 year old right handed Italian American man
with past medical history of left parietal stroke 1 year ago
with
slurred speech, right sided incoordination (followed at [**Hospital1 2025**]),
obesity, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, diabetes,
hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, CAD status post angioplasty, who presented
to ED today for evaluation of several day history of slurred
speech and 1 day of vertigo, nausea, vomiting.

Patient is unable to give a history so history taken from his
girlfriend. She states that she has noticed intermittent
slurring
of his speech for past 3 days. Yesterday, he seemed off balance
and unsteady when walking. Then this morning, he had a right
sided headache radiating from his right posterolateral neck up
to
over the vertex. Then around 10am, he started to have
nausea and vomiting of non-bloody, non-bilious material. He
became diaphoretic. He felt dizzy, like sensation room was
spinning and felt unsteady when walking. EMS was called and he
was transported to ED. Finger stick en route 175.

Patient able to tell me that he has had double vision and
problems with his hearing for months. No dysphagia. He feels
like
he is off balance and that he has to hold onto things to walk.
His right side is clumsier than usual. He states this is exactly
how he felt during his stroke, with exception of the nausea and
vomiting.

No recent illnesses, fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, cough, sputum, abdominal pain, increased
urinary frequency, dysuria. No new visual changes (states
diplopia has been going on for months), comprehension
difficulty,
focal numbness, weakness, paresthesias. No bowel or bladder
incontinence.

CT head [**1-8**]:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect or shift of the normally midline
structures. The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns demonstrate no
effacement. The patient is status post left parietal lobe
infarct with hypodense sequelae at this site. There is no
hydrocephalus. The paranasal sinuses are clear. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter junction is indistinct.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CT head [**1-9**]:
No intracranial hemorrhage is identified. Within the right
cerebellar hemisphere, there is a large area of low attenuation,
which was not seen previously, with associated slight mass
effect. The remainder of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation
is preserved. There is an area of decreased attenuation within
the left parietal lobe, which is increased, and corresponds to
chronic changes from prior infarct. The ventricles are
symmetric, and there is no shift of normally midline structures.
Soft tissue and osseous structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: There is a new area of low attenuation within the
right cerebellar hemisphere, which is concerning for a acute
right cerebellar infarct. No intracranial hemorrhage is
identified.
.
CTA head: prelim.
1. No evidence of vertebral artery or carotid dissection.
2. Area of decreased attentuation within the right cerebellar
hemisphere is again seen, likely representing subacute infarct.
Recons pending.
.
RUQ US:
1. Diffuse increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma,
consistent with fatty infiltration. Other forms of liver
disease, including more severe forms such as hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
2. No radiographic evidence for acute cholecystitis or
cholelithiasis. No gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic
fluid, or intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
.
CT head [**1-12**]:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage is seen. The previously
identified areas of low attenuation in the left parietal lobe,
as well as the right cerebellar hemisphere are unchanged.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normal midline structures.
Overall, the exam is not significantly changed from [**2190-1-9**].
.
Right LENIs [**1-13**]:
No evidence of DVT.
.
ECG:
Atrial fibrillation
Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is 53 year old man with a past medical history of
stroke one year ago (slurred speech and right sided
incoordination), obesity, type II DM, COPD, atrial fibrillation,
and a history of melanoma who presented to the ED [**1-8**] with a
three day history of slurred speech, imbalance, and vertigo.
