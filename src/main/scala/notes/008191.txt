.
[**2106-4-11**] GIB study:
IMPRESSION: Single focus of tracer uptake in the right lower
abdomen that likely represents a focus of bleeding, the location
of which cannot be determined due to its static nature.
.
[**2106-4-13**] CXR: CONCLUSION: No new focus of pneumonia.
Progressively resolving bilateral parenchymal opacities,
consistent with resolving aspiration pneumonitis..
.
[**2106-4-13**] Colonoscopy:
Findings:
 Mucosa: Localized superficial ulceration with no bleeding was
noted in the proximal ascending colon. These findings are
compatible with postpolypectomy site. The area was difficult to
visualize due to residual fecal material and also, the area was
technicially difficult to reach. There was no evidence of active
bleeding.
Impression: Small ulceration in the proximal ascending colon
compatible with postpolypectomy site


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  79 yo M with COPD, AFib, recently
diagnosed PE, recently admitted for BRBPR in setting of
anticoagulation, now presents with BRBPR.
.
* Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
Nuclear study with evidence of static bleeding (RLQ) at
unspecified location.  Colonoscopy demonstrated superficial
ulceration and small clot at post-polypectomy site, which is the
same location as that seen on the red tag cell scan.  Restarted
antiocagulation, advanced diet.  Hct stablilized on [**2106-4-14**].
Pantoprazole changed to daily dosing.
.
* Pulmonary Embolism: dx in [**2106-2-21**]. Given 4 units of FFP and
1 mg of vitamin IV for reversal. Upper and lower extremity
ultrasounds were negative for DVT. Discussed filter, but given
that bleeding site most likely secondary to post-polypectomy,
agreed with restarting anti-coagulation with heparin bridge to
coumadin. Follow up with PCP for duration of treatment.  Patient
was therapeutic at discharge.
.
* CAD: during last admission, he was noted to develop anginal
symptoms in setting of tachycardia. Continued statin,
beta-blocker, held aspirin.
- PCP to readdress long term aspirin use in setting of GIB.
consider restarting after treatment course completed for PE.
.
* COPD - severe, uses 3L oxygen at home at night
- cont prednisone at 25 mg-> tapered to 15 mg [**2106-4-15**] (on
bactrim for PCP prophylaxis given long use)
- continued monteleukast, advair, tiotropium, and albuterol
nebs.
.
* Atrial Fibrillation - in sinus.  thought to be in setting of
PE.  Should discuss with cardiologist/PCP re the need for
longterm anticoagulation in setting of 2 serious GIB for PE
treatment.
- resumed rate controlling meds with beta-blockade and CCB
.
* diastolic dysfunction:  continued TEDs, ACE, low Na diet
.
* HTN: resumed outpatient regimen.
.
* thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology. HIT Ab negative. Resolved.

.
* Oral Candidiasis: started clotrimazole
.
*Prophylaxis: PPI,  SSI [**Hospital1 **] while on steroids, hold bowel
regimen.  contact precautions for MRSA, [**Name (NI) **].
*FEN: NPO for now, low Na cardiac diet when able to take POs
*Code Status: Full
