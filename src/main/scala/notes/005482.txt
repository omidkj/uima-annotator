HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old woman with
past medical history of non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis who was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2117-4-24**] for hypoglycemia
and mental status changes.  The patient reportedly went on a
starvation diet 6 days prior to admission.  The night before
admission the patient was found to be lethargic with blood
sugars of 39 per her husband.  The following morning the
patient continued to be unarousable and lethargic; EMS was
called, her blood sugar was found to be 11.  At that point
patient was administered 3 amps of D50 in addition to Narcan
which led to the patient being partially arousable.  She was
subsequently brought to the Emergency Room and intubated for
airway protection.  The patient also got activated charcoal,
Ceftriaxone and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit she was treated for
aspiration pneumonia with Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  A head CT
and lumbar puncture was not possible due to patient's body
habitus.  A neuro consult was obtained; EEG showed no
seizures, however, showed positive spindle, consistent with
metabolic encephalopathy.  The patient was successfully
extubated, and her mental status improved slowly.  She was
diuresed in the Medical Intensive Care Unit in light of
radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  The
patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Company 191**] firm for
further care on [**2117-4-30**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, morbid obesity, hypertension, status post right hip
fracture in [**2112**], osteoarthritis, history of MRSA cellulitis,
history of urinary incontinence, depression, COPD, history of
left lower quadrant abdominal wall hematoma and recurrent
abdominal cellulitis.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, sliding scale insulin, insulin
NPH 30 units subcu [**Hospital1 **], MS Contin 50 mg po q day, Paxil 60 mg
po q day, Clonazepam one tablet po bid, Meclizine one tablet
po tid, Celebrex 200 mg po q day.  On transfer to the
medicine service, NPH insulin, sliding scale insulin, subcu
Heparin, Protonix, Lasix 40 mg IV tid, Norvasc 10 mg po q
day, Captopril 75 mg po tid, Combivent MDI.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives at home with husband, has
hospital bed at home, minimal activities of daily living.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer temperature 98.7, pulse
92, blood pressure 125/53, respiratory rate 22, sats 96% on
three liters via nasal cannula.  In general, morbidly obese,
lying in bed in no apparent distress, slow speech.  HEENT:
Mucus membranes moist, no lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary clear
to auscultation anteriorly.  Cardiovascular, distant heart
sounds, S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen obese,
nontender, non distended, positive bowel sounds, multiple
well healed scars in abdomen.  Extremities, positive pitting
edema bilaterally, venous changes in lower extremities
bilaterally.  Neuro, alert and oriented times three, no focal
neurologic deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.9, hematocrit 40,
platelet count 214,000, sodium 141, potassium 3.6, chloride
97, CO2 34, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 240.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Neuro:  The patient's neurologic status was monitored
clinically every day.  The patient made slow improvement in
her mental status.  She had cleared sensorium at time of
discharge.  The patient's speech was initially slurred,
however, it returned to baseline at time of discharge.

2.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on NPH insulin with
slowly increasing doses as well as sliding scale of insulin
to control her blood sugars.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient likely has obstructive sleep
apnea given her body habitus and occasional desats at night.
The patient was put on C-pap at night with good results.  The
patient continued to be on two liters of oxygen via nasal
cannula.  The patient was initially diuresed with Lasix in
light of radiographic evidence for congestive heart failure.
However, patient developed a contraction alkalosis and
hypokalemia secondary to diuresis and Lasix was discontinued.
The patient did not have additional crackles on lung exam and
her O2 requirements did not go up, therefore there was no
need to continue diuresis with Lasix.

4.  Cardiovascular:  The patient's high blood pressure was
controlled with Captopril as well as Norvasc.  Towards the
latter half of her stay, Hydrochlorothiazide was added to her
regimen for better control of her blood pressure.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the course
of her stay in the hospital.

5.  GI:  The patient was amenable to considering gastroplasty
given her morbid obesity.  A surgical consult was obtained
from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The surgical team advised patient to
follow-up once her medical issues were resolved.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Altered mental status secondary to profound hypoglycemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  NPH 30 units subcu q a.m., 20 units
subcu q p.m., Regular insulin sliding scale, subcu Heparin
5000 units subcu [**Hospital1 **], Protonix 40 mg po q day,
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po q day, Norvasc 10 mg po q day,
Captopril 100 mg po tid, Combivent MDI 2 puffs qid, Flovent
MDI 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **], KCL 40 mEq po q day, Paxil 40 mg po q day,
