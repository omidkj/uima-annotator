Brief Hospital Course:
1. Anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction
Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] approximately 16 hours after the
intial onset of [**7-3**] substernal chest pain.  However given the
patient's age, the extent of coronary artery disease, and late
presentation, the patient was not deemed a suitable candidate
for cardiac catherization and was tranferred to the CCU for
medical management.  At the time of tranfer the patient's PAP
was 40/17, PCWP was 17, CI was
1.7 and PA sat was 49%.  Enzymes from the OSH were notable for
CK 1043, MB 123, MB 11.8 and Trop I 45.2.  EKG from the OSH
showed T wave inversions and Q waves in V1-V3.  An echo done at
the [**Hospital1 **], showed an EF of 15-20%, and depressed left ventricular
systolic function.  (An echo a year prior had been completely
normal). Throughout his course patient was medically managed for
his coronary artery disease with aspirin, lipitor and plavix.
Cardiac enzymes trended downward and with gentle diuresis
patient's cardiac index improved to 3.15.
.
2. Aflutter
The patient's initial course was complicated on the day of
presentation by atrial flutter, with HR>150.  Early in the
hospital course the patient was asymptomatic during these
episodes and would revert back into normal sinus rhythm.  The
patient was medically managed with Amiodarone.  On [**2176-6-17**] the
patient reverted back into atrial flutter while going to the
bathroom. Thus, despite being on Amiodarone, it became apparent
that with the slightest exertion the patient was unstable.  The
decision was made cardiac ablation.  This intervention was a
temporary one because the patient reverted back into aflutter
approximately 2-3 hours following the procedure..  The final
decision has been to give the patient an amiodarone load over
the course of one month, 400 mg / day.  Pt was also started on
Coumadin.  However this was later held due to elevated INRs.
.
3. Hypotension
On [**2176-6-19**], the patient became acutely hypotensive, SBP's
70s-80s.  An echo revealed no cardiac effusion (s/p day 1
cardiac ablation).  Blood cultures were sent which later came
back negative.  An EKG was done which showed no significant
changes.  The patient responded to 2 liters of fluids.  SBP
improved to the 120s.  Pressors were never administered.  The
patient returned to the CCU for overnight monitoring.
.
Given the patient's poor P.O. intake throughout his course, this
hypotensive episode may have resulted from the patient being
intravascularly depleted.  The patient was started on
maintenance fluids.
.
5. Nutrition
The patient has had poor P.O. intake throughout hospitalization.
 The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and
esophageal strictures requiring dilatation. To better assess the
patient's aspiration risk, a speech and swallow was done.  The
patient did not show evidence of aspiration during the study.
The patient was noted to have an extremely discoordinated oral
phase.  A GI consult was then obtained to rule out the
possibility of a stricture.  A barium study was done.  Due to
the limitations of the study, GI recommended an outpt eval in
2-3weeks.
.
In order to improve the patient's nutritional status, the
patient has been receiving tube feeds through a nasogastric
tube.
.
6.Hypoxia
.On [**2176-6-22**], the patient became acutely hypoxic, desatting to
89% on 4L.  A CXR showed bilateral effusions, left lower lobe
collapse, consolidation, and mild background of CHF.  The
patient was readmitted to the CCU for diuresis.  The patient was
started on on ceftriaxone for presumed pneumonia.  The patient
was already on Flagyll for C.diff.
.
7. Infection
.
On the day of admission the patient was continued on Flagyll due
to a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia from the nursing home.
Stool cultures later came back positiove for C. diff.  The
decision was made to continue the antibiotic for a 14 day
course.
.
UA
.
On [**2176-6-24**], a family meeting was called to address the goals of
care for Mr. [**Known lastname **].  His children, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 29572**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29573**] with RN were present.  As the patient's
cardiac and pulmonary status continued a tenuous course, a
decision was made to ask the family whether they agreed that a
Swan Ganz pulmonary artery catheter should be placed.  The
family unanimously agreed that the patient would not have wanted
continued invasive monitoring, and the request was made to make
Mr. [**Known lastname **] DNR/DNI status, and then finally, CMO status.  He
was made comfortable with a morphine IV drip after Palliative
Care was consulted.  The patient expired within the next 36
hours secondary to respiratory arrest/hypoxia.  His family was
notified, and elected not to undergo autopsy.
