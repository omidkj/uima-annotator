Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy [**5-17**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75 yo F with morbid obesity, AF on coumadin, and
porphyria who presents with an acute onset of GI bleed. She
noticed BRBPR in her bed pan this morning at her nursing home.
Her VS were stable at the time (BP 148/78) She reports 3 bloody
BMs at her nursing home after being given lactulose 2 am,
another 2 at [**Hospital3 4107**], and 1 in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Pt was
unable to report the consistency and color of the blood [**1-23**] her
body habitus, but states she was told it was 'red and bloody'
and clotted. She reports she may have been on antibiotics ('some
penicillin') recently but does not know the results. Her INR was
recently supratherapeutic to 4.7 on [**4-28**] -> 3.6 on [**4-30**].8 on
[**5-2**], and 2.0 on [**5-9**]. Her coumadin was held from [**4-28**] - [**5-2**] for
her supratherapeutic INR. She also reports a history of
diverticulitis 30 years ago, but no bleeding. She denies any
recent ibuprofen or alcohol use. No uncooked hamburgers or fresh
water ingestion. She was transferred to [**Hospital3 **], where
she recieved 1 U PRBCs. Labs significant for a Cre of 1.3, INR
of 2.5, and Hct was noted to be 29.3 She had 2 PIVs placed and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.8 128/62 67 16 97% on RA. Labs
notable for Hct stable at 28.6 and Cre of 1.2. She refused NG
lavage. Maroon colored blood clots admixed with stool were noted
in the ED. Patient was crossmatched for 4 [**Location 16678**] and PRBCs,
and was given 10 mg IV vitamin K in the ED.  GI was consulted in
the ED, who recommended INR reversal and NPO for possible
colonoscopy tomorrow vs. tagged RBC scan. She was transferred to
the MICU for treatment of active GI bleed. On transfer, VS were
afebrile 66 161/62 14 94% on room air.
 .
On the floor, she denies any fevers, chills, cough, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, LH, dizziness, or syncope. She has
chronic SOB from her asthma. She reports she is bedbound but can
be transferred to a wheelchair. She reports a LLE laceration on
transfer from bed to wheelchair a few day ago that is s/p
repair.

Imaging/results:
CXR [**5-15**]: IMPRESSION: Technically limited study. Lateral view
demonstrates moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Otherwise, no
new gross focal abnormality concerning for pneumonia
.
C-scope [**5-17**]:
Impression: Polyp in the colon
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, descending colon and
ascending colon
Two prominent folds at approximately 25cm. Erythema of the
mucosa was also noted in this area likely due to scope trauma.
Ulceration in the anus-->biopsy
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum
Recommendations: Follow-up biopsies. Pt will need repeat
colonoscopy in near future for removal of polyps.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old female with h/o Afib on coumadin, morbid obesity,
DM, Gout, remote diverticulitis who was admitted from [**Hospital1 1501**] with
hematochezia in setting of therapuetic INR. Initially presented
to OSH. Recieved 1U at OSH and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. Admitted to
MICU.  Recieved 2U more prbc for active hematochezia and 2U FFP
and Vitamin K for INR 2.5 at OSH. Refused NGT but low suspicion
for UGIB as she remained stable. Strong suspicion for
diverticular bleed given acute history and spontaneous resolved.
 Her HCT stabilized around 30s and she was transfered out of
MICU [**5-14**]. Plan was for EGD/[**Last Name (un) **], but this was delayed by a few
days because of both poor prep and difficulty arranging for OR
time (couldnt do in GI suite due to weight). Finally underwent
colonoscopy on [**5-17**], EGD not done due to high risk procedure and
low suspicion for UGIB. C-scope showed diverticulosis, rectal
ulcer (would not have expected such a brisk bleed), and polyps
(nonbleeding)-->likely diverticular bleed.
She needs f/u C-scope for removal of polyps in future (not done
due to recent bleed). GI will contact with biopsy of rectal
ulcer to r/o malignancy. Will reccommend it should be safe to
resume prior dose of coumadin after 1week (so less risk for
bleeding from rectal ulcer biopsy site). Also ASA 81 was
resumed. Her HCT was above 30 for 4days before discharge. She
was tolerating diet. Placed on PO PPI daily (on asa/coumadin).
Other issues during this hospitalization: Her creat was 1.3 on
admission. She got blood and gentle fluids. Creat improved to
0.8 and was stable thereafter. She was total body volume
overloaded [**1-23**] acute dCHF (hypoxia, UE/LE edema, wheezing) and
got IV lasix X2 with neg 5L and creat remained stable. She will
be discharged on lasix 40mg daily and her creat should be
followed. Kept on lisinopril at higher dose. Presumed not on BB
due to bad asthma. Her Afib was not rate controlled and she was
started on dilt which was titrated to 240mg (HR 80s). Also her
BP was not controlled and her lisinopril was increased to 10,
dilt added as above, and lasix added as above. Her BP was
120/80s but would go to 180SBP when she was anxious/upset. Her
O2 sats were okay 92% during day but she would desat at night,
likely OSA, she has refused CPAP in past. Can consider giving
nocturnal O2 so can avoid stress on heart/hypoxia. Asthma was
stable on claritin and inhalers. Some fluid component to
wheezing, improved with diuresis.
Rest of meds are kept the same.

Below is progress note from day of discharge
75 year old female with h/o Afib on coumadin, morbid obesity,
DM, Gout, remote diverticulitis who is admitted with
hematochezia in setting of therapuetic INR. Stable. Transfered
out of MICU [**5-14**]. Awaiting EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on [**5-17**], delayed due to poor
prep and issue related to body habitus. Has issues with Afib/RVR
and dCHF.
.
Acute GI bleed: Patient likely with lower GI bleed given history
of diverticulosis and HDS while active hematochezia. Lower
suspicion for UGIB. Hct 29-30 stable after total 3U prbc. INR
reversed with ffp and vit K.
