Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro:  On arrival, the patient was awake, but minimally alert
and seemed to be unaware of her surroundings. Over the course of
her stay, she was maintained on the minimum amount of pain
medication necessary to adequately control her pain. As a stay
progress, she became more alert and interactive, and after
extubation, was alert, oriented, and very interactive. At the
time of discharge, the patient was alert, oriented times three,
and had a nonfocal neurologic exam. She was moving all four
extremities, and complained only of tenderness of the abdomen.
Still sluggish with decreased interactiveness but appropriate.

CV: Initially, the patient was tachycardic ranging up to 140.
She initially required a diltiazem drip to control her
tachycardia, but as her stay progressed, the diltiazem drip was
weaned, and she was restarted on her home rate control
medications.  She also initially required some low doses of
Neo-Synephrine. This was weaned to fully off finally on hospital
day seven, and she did not require any more
pressors. She is now controlled well on an oral diltiazema and
metoprolol regimen. She has not yet restarted her isosorbide,
diovan, or pradaxa. Those are currently on hold. The patient has
atrial fibrillation at baseline and fluctuates from sinus
tachycardia into afib with rate control 90-115 and stable [**Month/Day/Year **]
pressures.

R: After her surgery, the patient was vent dependent for several
days. On post operative day two, she was weaned to pressure
support. She remained on these settings until postoperative day
nine, after which she was extubated. From that point on, she
tolerated minimal oxygen, and Room air.  After extubation, the
decision was made by the family, after a long family meeting, to
make the patient DNR/DNI. She is getting albuterol and
ipratropium inhalers as needed.

GI: On postoperative day two, she began to have stool from her
ostomy. Her tube feeds restarted on postoperative day four and
she continued to tolerate these throughout her stay. On
postoperative day 11, she failed a speech and swallow test,
after extubation, and had a dobhoff feeding tube placed, as she
had initially had an OGT while intubated.  On postoperative day
one, the patient had a wound VAC placed over the midline
laparotomy incision. Last change [**9-11**]. End ileostomy with stool
output, scant mucous output from mucous fistula. Two Jp drains
from OR removed prior to discharge. Famotidine prophylaxis
ongoing.

GU: The patient made adequate urine throughout her stay, which
was monitored with the catheter. On postoperative day six, she
began to have signs consistent with pulmonary edema. She was
started on a Lasix drip , But was only slightly negative for the
first several days. On postoperative day nine, she began to
diurese quite effectively, with no compromise of her hemodynamic
stability. On postoperative day 11, Lasix drip as stopped and
she was continued on intermittent Lasix. She continued to have
excellent output after this. She should continue to have close
monitoring of I's and O's and urine output.

Heme: In total, the patient received two units of packed red
[**Month/Year (2) **] cells. Her hematocrit was monitored frequently. After her
surgery, her hematocrit remained stable throughout her stay.
Pradaxa is being held at this time because it cannot be crushed
via the dophoff tube. The patient's PCP should determine the
patient's risk for stroke in setting of afib. For now no
anticoagulation. Hep
