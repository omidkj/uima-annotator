   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

[**2137-5-8**] 5:15 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Assess for intracranial processes/bleed

INDICATION: 61-year-old man with repair of aortic aneurysm and
confusion and dementia. Please evaluate for intracranial
processes.

No comparison is available.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: No edema, masses, mass effect, hemorrhage, or
infarction is noted. The ventricles and sulci are mildly
prominent consistent with age-appropriate involutional changes.
The periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent
with small vessel disease. The visualized portion of paranasal
sinuses are clear. The mastoid air cells are filled with fluid
most likely related to the recent intubation. Note is also made
of calcification within the intrapetrosal and intracavernosal
portion of the both carotid arteries and in the vertebral
arteries.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology including no
hemorrhage.

Findings

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Dilated RV cavity.
Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Normal
PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF 70-80%). The right ventricular cavity is borderline dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2137-4-29**], the left ventricle is now hyperdynamic. Right
ventricular size and function appear similar grossly, but the
right ventricle is suboptimally visualized in both studies,
precluding definitive assessment and comparison.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)INDICATION: Shortness of breath

As compared to the previous examination, the nasogastric tube
and the central venous access line has been removed. The cardiac
silhouette is of unchanged size. The pre-existing subtle left
basal opacities have cleared; the right basal opacities are
slightly more extensive than on the previous examination. There
is no evidence of pleural effusion. No other relevant changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admiited and preop'd for AAA repair

Abdominal aortic aneurysm with right renal artery stenosis and
bilateral iliac artery
occlusive disease.

PROCEDURE:

Resection and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Eversion endarterectomy and reimplantation of right renal artery
into graft.
Repair of aneurysm with 20 x 10 aortobifemoral bypass.

Tolerated the procedure well.. No complications.

Transfered to the [**Year/Month/Day 42137**] in stable condition

While in the [**Name (NI) **] pt was weaned from pressure support. It was
noticed that the patient had loose stool with rising lactate.

Stat GS consult for endoscopy, high suspicion for ischemic
colitis.
Imaging:  Colonoscopy - 30cc from anal verge - no signs of
ischemia

followed lactates and base excess, all trending down. Pt
stablalizes.

Pt also recieved Blood products for blood loss in the OR.

Pt had runs of V tach and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
