Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2132-8-30**]: Comparison is [**2132-8-29**] and before. The patient is
post-median sternotomy with changes of CABG. Mediastinal contour
is unremarkable. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left and minimal plate-like atelectasis at the bases. There is
no pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Small pleural effusions, otherwise
no significant abnormality.

Echocardiogram [**2132-8-27**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: Normal biventricular systolic function. LVEF 55%.
Intact thoracic aorta. No new valvular findings.

Cardiac Cath [**2132-8-22**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this
left dominant system demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA
had no angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had a proximal
90% severe in-stent restenosis. The Cx had a 60-70% stenosis at
the origin. The RCA was a small non-dominant vessel with no
angiographically apparent disease. 2. Limited resting
hemodynamics revealed slightly elevated left sided filling
pressures with an LVEDP of 21 mmmHg. The central aortic pressure
was 145/56 mmHg. There was no transvalvular gradient on pullback
from the LV to the aorta. 3. Left ventriculography revealed an
ejection fraction of 68%. There was no abnormal wall motion
present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21883**] was brought to the operating room on [**2132-8-27**] where he
underwent Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 2. Cross clamp time =
29 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time = 44 minutes. Please
refer to operative report for further surgical details. Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated in stable but
critical condition. He awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without difficulty. He was weaned off pressor support,
was hemodynamically stable, and was started on Beta
blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuretics. On postoperative day one
he was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. On post-op day two he went into atrial
fibrillation, with amiodarone and increased beta-blocker he
converted to sinus rhythm within 24 hrs. He was started on
Coumadin but after several days of no atrial fibrillation,
Coumadin was stopped. Physical Therapy was consulted for
evaluation of strength and mobility. He developed bilateral
forearm phlebitis from amiodarone infusions and was started on
course of Keflex. By the time of discharge on post-op day seven
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was
discharged to home with VNA in good condition. All follow up
instructions were advised.
