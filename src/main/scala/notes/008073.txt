History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F with history of HTN, CKD (baseline 1.8) presents initially
to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**] with complaint of back pain between her
shoulder blades and nausea.  Symptoms started intermittently and
gradually over the last few days.  Had a recent fall, but
symptoms preceded the fall, and she had no injuries from the
fall.  Never had this pain before.  Denies CP, SOB, vomiting,
fevers, chills, diarrhea.  Found to have troponin I of 0.13.
EKG with ST elevation in inferolateral leads.  Transferred here
for cath.
.
In the cath lab, she was found to have a distal full thrombotic
occlusion of the distal right posterolateral.  PCI was
attempted, but wire was unable to be fully passed, unable to
obtain flow through the PL, remains occluded.  Received plavix
300 mg x1.  She was noted to be hypertensive to the 190s,
started on a nitro drip prior to coming to the CCU.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she endorses a little nausea, but denies
any chest pain, back pain, SOB, diaphoresis.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black

Imaging:
[**2166-3-7**] Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated two-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
free of
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD had a

mid-vessel long 70% stenosis with large and tortuous diagonal
branches.
The LCx was proximally chronically occluded with left-to-left
collaterals filling the obtuse marginal system.  The RCA had
mild
luminal irregularities; there was a 100% thrombotic total
occlusion of
the distal PL.
2) A 2.0 x 12 mm balloon was used as the primary reperfusion
therapy for
the occlusion, but failed to reestablish stable flow; given
severe renal
insufficiency and the small territory at risk, further attempts
at
reperfusion were abandoned (see interventional details).
3) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic
arterial
hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 194/84 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Medical management of STEMI.
2. Secondary prevention of CAD.

ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation,
the pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an
OVERestimation of true mitral valve area. An eccentric jet of
severe ([**2-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-12-8**],
the LVEF is now depressed (post MI). The degree of MR has
probably increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a95 F with history of HTN, CKD presents with STEMI

#. STEMI - The patient presented to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**] with back
pain between her shoulder blades and nausea. She was found to
have an elevated troponin I of 0.13 with an EKG demonstrating ST
elevations in inferolateral leads.  The patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.  In the cath lab, she was found
to have a distal full thrombotic occlusion of the distal right
posterolateral.  PCI was attempted, but wire was unable to be
fully passed and the artery remained occluded. She received
plavix 300 mg x1 and ASA.  She was noted to be hypertensive to
the 190s, started on a nitro drip prior to transfer to the CCU.
The patient also has mid LAD vessel long 70% stenosis of the mid
LAD and a proximally and chronically occluded LCx with left to
left collateraols filling from the OM system.  An ECHO
demonstrated decreased EF of 45%, with mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation was seen. An eccentric jet of
severe ([**2-23**]+) mitral regurgitation was seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation was seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There was no pericardial effusion.
She was started on asa 25 for a least one month (which could be
lowered to 81mg after one month) and plavix 75mg for 6 month.
She was also started on atorvastatin 80mg.  She was also
continued on metoprolol succinate 50mg, whi
