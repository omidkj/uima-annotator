Admission Date:  [**2150-6-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2150-7-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2105-2-24**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Oncology

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained in the hospital until
[**7-21**], mostly because of placement issues.  Originally
thought that he would go to [**Hospital6 310**],
but by the time he was discharged on [**7-21**], he was
stable enough to go home with home services.

On [**7-15**], the patient had a gallium study done and this
revealed interval disappearance of focally increased activity
within the axilla and inguinal regions compared with previous
gallium study done on [**2149-1-20**].  On [**7-15**], the
patient also received 2 units of packed red blood cells
because of a hematocrit of 26 with good response.  His
absolute neutrophil count continued to increase, and he
remained afebrile.  His allopurinol was continued for 10 days
post chemotherapy, and then it was discontinued.  His renal
function remained stable.  We continued to replete his
electrolytes as needed.  He was started on magnesium twice a
day because of continual required repletions.  The acyclovir
was continued for 10 days total until the date of discharge
and was switched from intravenous to p.o. 400 mg five times a
day.  When the patient was afebrile for more than 48 hours
with an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 1000, his
ceftazidime was discontinued.  His Nystatin and Peridex were
continued throughout his hospitalization stay and were
prescribed upon discharge, as were his antiretroviral therapy
and Bactrim.  His creatine kinase continued to trend
downward, and upon discharge was 455.  His prednisone
continued to be weaned and eventually discontinued.  His
hemoptysis eventually resolved.  He did have some low-grade
fevers in the low 100s, thought to be secondary to his
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  His Neupogen was discontinued on
[**7-19**] because of a stable and increasing white blood
cell count up to 15.3.

On [**7-21**], the patient was seen by Physical Therapy and
it was thought that he was stable enough to go home instead
of to rehabilitation.  The patient was discharged and he went
immediately to his appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for his
intrathecal chemotherapy.
