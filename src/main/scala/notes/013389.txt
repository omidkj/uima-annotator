CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2102-6-9**]:
Mild interstitial edema with cardiomegaly.
.
TTE [**2102-6-12**]:
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the septum and inferior wall. The right
ventricular cavity is not well seen but appears mildly dilated
and probably hypertrophied. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Dilatation and probable hypertrophy of the right ventricle, its
function cannot be accurately assessed. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Biatrial enlargement.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2102-6-14**]:
1. Subtle line at the right lung apex with evidence of some lung
markings beyond it, could represent a skinfold. Followup
radiograph to definitively exclude pneumothorax is recommended.
This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
2. Left chest wall transvenous pacer with right atrial and
ventricular leads in standard location without a left
pneumothorax.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with hypertension,  chronic right heart
failure, coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2083**],
atrial fibrillation on warfarin admitted with asymptomtic
bradycardia and acute on chronic renal failure in the setting of
recent diarrhea and weight gain.

# Rhythm:
Asymptomatic bradycardia, with history of atrial fibrillation.
Pt was admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.  Pt remained
asymptomatic throughout his stay even though she had heart rates
that dropped as low as high 20s.  His coumadin was held and he
received 2.5mg vitamin K on [**2102-6-11**] in preparation for pace maker
placment.  Appreciate electrophysiology recommendations.  A Pace
maker was placed on [**6-13**] without complication.

# Pump: Has fine crackles at bases and 1+ edema in BLE. Has
right sided heart failure per out patient cardiologist ([**Doctor Last Name **])
and elevated BNP.  An ECHO was done which showed EF 30-35%,
moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. Dilatation and
probable hypertrophy of the right ventricle. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension and biatrial enlargement. His Lasix
was held for some diarrhea and acute on chronic renal failure.
He was discharged on decreased lasix dose of 20 mg twice daily.
.
#. CAD: History of CAD s/p CABG in 80s. Remained asymtomatic
during her stay here. He was continued on his statin.  Patient
will have device clinic, electrophysiology and cardiology follow
up as out patient.
.
# Diarrhea: 3 large liquid bowel movements which resolved on
admission.  C.diff test was negative.  Most likely due to
transient viral infection.
.
# Chronic Kidney Disease: Unclear baseline. His Cr was 3.7 and
trended down to 2.5 (felt to be baseline; but unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) **]
likely due to poor forward flow in the setting of bradycardia.
His home lasix was held in setting of ARF and restarted at
decreased dose on discharge.  His trandolapril was discontinued
during this stay.
.
# Anemia: Currently at baseline of 34-36.
.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH and free T4 within normal limits.
Continued on home synthroid.
.
# Depression: Continued home wellbutrin and celexa
.
