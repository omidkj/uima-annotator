Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization ([**2179-2-18**])

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 78 y/o active M who has been feeling bad for the
last 10 days.  His girlfriend had a GI illness previously and
developed symptoms of URTI and diarrhea.  He went to ED at
[**Location (un) **] yesterday with SOB and was found to be in heart failure
and was to be admitted but left AMA.  Patient then was seen by
his cardiologist who performed an echo at [**Location (un) **] and found to
have reduced LVEF of 15%.  Patient returned to [**Location **] where he
recieved aspirin, plavix, and started on Nitro gtt and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath where he was found to have 3
vessel disease with 60% proximal LAD, 80% mid LAD, 70% mid LCx,
and 90% RCA lesions.  Patient also with elevated wedge of 33 and
CI of 1.2.  He was given 20 IV lasix in cath lab and gentle
dobutamine.  Patient denies any chest pain.  No current chest
pain, no shortness of breath.  States he had several episodes of
PND and chest tightness a few days prior.  No fever or chills.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization ([**2179-2-18**]):  Selective coronary
angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated a three
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had mild
non-obstructive disease.  The LAD had diffuse disease along with
a 60% proximal stenosis and an 80% bifrucation lesion at the
mid-distal segment.  The LCx had a 60-70% stenosis in its mid
vessel as well as a diffuse disease.  The dominant RCA had a 90%
mid vessel stenosis as well as the diffuse disease throughout.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a severely elevated right and left
sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 19 mm Hg and a mean
PCWP of 33 mm Hg. The cardiac index was severely depressed at
1.2 l/min/m2.  Left ventriculography was deferred given elevated
filling pressures.
.
TTE ([**2179-2-19**]): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
EKG ([**2179-2-18**]): NSR @ 84, low voltage in limb leads, normal
intervals, Flat T V4-V5
.
Persantine myocardial perfusion study ([**2179-2-22**]):
1) Severe, globally decreased left ventricular wall motion with
an LVEF of 19%.  2) Moderate, fixed inferior wall defect. 3)
Dilated LV cavity.  4)There is no significant change in reduced
uptake in the inferior wall on delayed 24 hour images which
suggests non-viability.  These findings can be further evaluated
with an FDG-PET viability scan, if clinically indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1137**] was initially admitted from the cath lab to the CCU
on a low dose dobutamine drip and with an IABP in place.
Overnight, he was aggressively diuresed with Lasix and has a
significant improvement in his cardiac index.  The dobutamine
was quickly weaned off and his IABP was removed.  His TSH and
ferritin were normal and helped rule out metabolic causes of his
cardiomyopathy.  He was started on low dose digoxin and
spironolactone and was titrated up on an ACEi and carvedilol.
He was called out to the floor where he underwent evaluation for
CABG by the CT surgery team.  Carotid dopplers showed an
insignificant amount of atherosclerosis.  A persantine
myocardial viability study confirmed his markedly depressed LVEF
(19%) and delyaed images showed no evidence of uptake throughout
his fixed inferior wall defect, which is suggestive of
nonviability.  Since he was asymptomatic and being maximally
medically managed, he was discharged home with plans to followup
with cardiology and cardiac surgery.
