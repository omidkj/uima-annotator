Echocardiogram [**2200-4-8**]
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis in
theRCA distribution in addition to the global LV hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname **]
[**Known lastname 21883**] before surgical incision.

POST-BYPASS:
Normal RV systolic function.
Overall LVEF 35%. Prebypass hypokinetic areas remain.
Intact thoracic aorta.
The aortic bioprosthetic valve is insitu, well positioned and
functioning well with a transaortic valvular mean gradient of
11mm of Hg.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21883**] was brought to the operating room on [**2200-4-8**], where
he underwent Redo- Sternotomy, AVR ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11688**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue) with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  While in the operating room he received 2 units of
PRBC for HCT of 23. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was  transferred to the CVICU in
stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.   POD 1
the patient extubated, he was alert, oriented and  breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable. He weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  He was gently diuresed toward his
preoperative weight.  His renal function remained within normal
limits with good urine output.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  His blood
sugars were less than 150. On [**2200-4-11**] he developed rapid atrial
fibrillation and converted to sinus rhythm with IV Lopressor and
amiodarone.  He remained hemodynamically stable. He was
transfused with 1 unit of PRBC on [**2200-4-12**] for HCT of 27.   He
tolerated a regular cardiac diet. He was evaluated by physical
therapy for assistance with strength and mobility.  He ambulated
in the halls with a rolling walker and assistance.  His pain was
well controlled with oral analgesics. Coumadin was started for A
Fin coverage.He continued to make steady progress and was
discharged to Health So [**Location (un) 1514**] NH on POD #6. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his cardiologist/PCP as an outpatient.
Target INR 2.0-2.5 for A Fib. First INR blood draw tomorrow at
rehab.
