was for scheduled left superficial parotidectomy and deep facial
nerve dissection([**2137-7-23**]).

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Surgery: the patient went to the operating room for the
above-mentioned procedure as scheduled. The surgery was
successful, completely removing the left parotid gland and
dissecting all the branches of the facial nerve while keeping
the nerve intact. Post-operatively he does have some very slight
weakness of the upper branches of the nerve, but function is
essentially intact. His pain was well-controlled on oral pain
medications and he is taking good po's and producing good urine
upon discharge on POD2. Intr-op complication as described below.

2. Tachycardia/Hypotension: In the OR, pt was hypotensive to the
80s and was started on neosynephrine. Also found to be
tachycardic to the 130s. Intraoperative ABG was: 7.36/45/81/26.
In the OR pt received metoprolol (10 mg), was briefly on an
esmolol drip, and received fluid boluses (total fluids 2600cc
with UO 285cc). Pt transferred to the ICU intubated on propofol
and on phenylephrine gtt. Upon arrival to intensive care unit,
90s systolic with HR in 120s. Initially, pt was placed on
esmolol drip. Because we wanted to quickly extubate pt, and
would need to rebolus esmolol and titrate, decision was made to
give IV metoprolol. After successful extubation, we restarted
beta blocker (metoprolol for ability to titrate better). He was
low susupision for MI, however enzymes were sent and after three
sets of negative enzymes he ruled-out for MI and was taken off
telemetry when he was transferred to the floor on POD1. His
a-fib was stable throughout the hospitalization. His coumadin
was held and can be restarted the evening of POD2 at the regular
dose (no loading dose is necessary). An outpatient
echocardiogram is recommended as the patient reports he had one
1-2 years ago at OSH.

3. Respiratory Support- Patient was sent to the unit intubated
immediately post-op. He was initially on SIMV changed to CPAP.
FiO2 was easily weaned down and sedation weaned off. Pt was
successfully extubated several hours after surgery and placed on
40% tent mask satting 100% without accessory muscle usage and in
no distress. He was weaned to room air while still in the unit
and is breathing comfortably and saturating well upon discharge.
A post-op CXR was obtained and was not significant for any new
pneumonia/aspiration/chf (see findings section).

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Reason for admission: Squamous cell carcinoma, left scalp.
secondary dx: Atrial fibrillation, CLL


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
Please call immediately or go to the emergency room if you
develop fevers/chills, chest pain or pressure or shortness of
breath, or the operative wound becomes warm, swollen, severely
painful or begins draining pus. You may resume your regular
activities when you get home (such as showering) however avoid
swimming or tub-bathing for 2 weeks.

Please re-start all your home medications tonight. Your coumadin
can begin again at your regular dose. There is no necessity for
any kind of loading dose. Please follow-up with your primary
care doctor/cardiologist for an echocardiogram within the next
several weeks. This is important because of your atrial
fibrillation but can be done as an outpatient.

The pain medication is as needed, however it is important that
you take a stool softener since narcotics tend to be very
constipating. You can take something over-the-counter such as
colace 100mg twice a day or senna for instance. Please call if
you have any questions.
