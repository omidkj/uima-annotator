Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Spehenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2134-11-19**]: Right pterional craniotomy for tumor resection


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 53M s/p fall at home(reportedly tripped on trash),
down for approximately 12hrs. EMS arrived, and he was found to
be disoriented. He was apparently able to walk to the ambulance
of his own volition, but became obtunded, tachycardic and
hypoxic en route to the hospital.  He was intubated at that
time. Head CT was done, which revealed a significantly sized
right fronto-parietal mass, and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for definitive neurosurgical care.

Past Medical History:
HTN, DM, GOUT, OSA, Class III Obestiy

Social History:
Unmarried, resides at home alone. Per brother(who resides in
OH), he was laid off approximately two years ago(previously
workes as a security operations manager for [**Company **]). He reports
since that time, he has had subtle personality changes. Within
the last six months, had become progressively socially recluse,
to the point of neglecting self care.  His parents are
alive(residing in FL-mother with dementia, father w/ [**Name2 (NI) **] IV
Renal CA), a sister(who also resides in FL), and
brother([**Name (NI) **])-whom resides in OH.

Imaging:
CTA of Head: significantly sized sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] mass extending up
to the right fronto parietal region. Measure approx 8cm in
diameter. approx 1.5cm of subfalcineherniation.

CT Head(post-op): showing appropriate resection and
decompression.

Head CT [**11-28**]: area of hypodenisity within the right MCA
distribution. Again noted are expected post-surgical changes.

Head CTA/P [**12-2**]:
1. There is no evidence of acute hemorrhagic transformation.
2. Status post craniotomy. Persistent hypodensity in the right
frontal and
temporal lobes, unchanged. Mass effect upon the ipsilateral
cerebral peduncle with midline shift, is slightly decreased in
size when compared to prior study.
3. Perfusion study demonstrates decreased cerebral blood volume
in the right MCA territory with increased MTT, consistent with
prior right MCA infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks. He
remained intubated and was on dilantin and decadron. He was able
to withdraw all 4 extremities to noxious stimuli. The patient
was morbidly obese and was unable to undergo an MRI because he
was over the weight limit. His CT scan revealed a 7.5 x 5.3 cm
mass in the right middle and anterior cranial fossa with midline
shift and uncal and subfalcine herniation. The patient was taken
to the operating room on [**2134-11-19**] and underwent a right
craniotomy for tumor resection. The procedure was technically
difficult due to the large size of the mass and the proximity of
the MCA. However, the tumor was able to be decompressed well
with no complications. The patient remained intubated and was
brought directly to CT for a post-op scan. It revealed expected
post-operative fluid within the resection cavity, decompression,
and decreased midline shift. The patient then returned to the
ICU.

His exam improved and he was able to follow commands when the
sedation was turned off. He was started on a decadron taper. His
dilantin levels were monitored and adjustments made as
indicated. The patient was extubated on [**11-23**] in the afternoon
without incident. It was further noted that his serum sodium
levels were becoming more elevated(153), so he was started on
100cc of free water q6h.  This was successfully treating his
hypernatremia.  On [**11-24**], he was transferred to the stepdown
unit. The sodium continued to improve. PT and OT worked with the
patient to get him OOB to chair. The patient's brother brought
in a list of home medications and these were added on [**11-26**].
Additionally a psych consult was obtained to determine if the
patient was competent to make his own decisions and to give his
brother permission to assist him with his affairs.

On [**11-27**] the patient was noted to be more obtunded and then
began to have respiratory distress he was immediately
transferred to ICU. He was found to have a hypercarbic acidosis.
Further imaging showed a RLL consolidation and a right mca
hypodensity. He continued to move all extremities with more
spontaneously movement on the right. Attempts to wean the vent
were successful, and he transferred to the neurosurgical
stepdown unit after extubation. LENIS and CTA ruled out DVT/PE.
Perfusion studies were performed for hypodensity on CT. This
showed decreased cerebral blood volume in the right MCA
territory with increased MTT, consistent with prior right MCA
infarct.

He was without neurologic deline but he continued to have
cognitive impairment. He was seen by psychiatry who felt that he
would benefit from inpatient cognitive rehab.
On [**12-8**], he was found to be significantly lethargic, and
minimally following commmands in comparision to previous days. A
blood gas was obtained and he was found to be hypercarbic
acidosis. An urgent Pulmonary and medicine consult was obtained.
He was transferred to the ICU for further pulmonary managment.
After further titration of his non-invasive support, his
acidosis was corrected, and mental status improved. Pulmonary
made significant recommendations as to the subsequent treatment
of his pulmonary management. He was screened and accepted for
disposition to [**Hospital1 **], and this was carried out on [**2134-12-10**]
