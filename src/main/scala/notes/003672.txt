CXR [**7-22**]:  AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are low.
There is bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right. There
is no edema, large effusion or pneumothorax.

Left-sided Port-A-Cath follows a normal course terminating at
the cavoatrial junction. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal
silhouette, hilar contours and pulmonary vasculature are normal.


CXR [**7-24**]:  The tip of the endotracheal tube is 4.1 cm above the
carina and adequately placed. The left Port-A-Catheter is
terminating into the upper SVC. There are no relevant changes in
the lung finding since [**2176-7-23**]. No new focus of
consolidation. There is no pneumothorax/effusion. Heart is
normal size.  The orogastric tube is extending below the level
of diaphragm, though the tip is beyond the view of the
radiograph.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
21F with exercise induced-asthma, multiple allergies, history of
anaphylaxis with multiple intubations in past year presents with
anaphylaxis to peanut.

# Anaphylaxis
Patient presenting with immediate symptoms from encountering
peanuts at zoo and subsequently presented to ER. Her respiratory
status became tenuous in the ER, and she was intubated for
airway protection. She likely had an immediate IgE reaction with
decompensation in the ER secondary to late products of
anaphylaxis causing airway compromise.  She recived famotidine
40 mg IV, solumedrol 125 mg IV q 8 hr and was extubated 12 hours
later.  About 1.5 hours after extubation, she developed
increased dyspnea and abnormal throat sensation.  Her pulse ox
was in the mid-80s with a good plethora, and she appeared very
distressed.  She was reintubated without incident.  There was
later a question of whether the pulse odometer was functioning
correctly, so it is uncertain whether she had hypoxemia prior to
reintubation or whether this represented an equipment failure of
the monitor. She was estivated the next day. Post-extubation
bronchoscopy showed no anatomical abnormalities of the laryngeal
structures or the trachea.

Allergy was consulted and raised the concern that the patient
may have somatization in the setting of a difficult family
situation. [**Hospital1 112**] tryptase and other evaluations had previously
been non diagnostic.  Patient went 24hrs post-extubation without
any further symptoms of respiratory distress or compromise.  In
discussion with the allergy service it was decided that she be
discharged home with a 7 day course of prednisone 60mg and
follow up with her allergist at [**Hospital1 112**] for decision about duration
of taper.
.
# Diabetes:  patient was continued on home lantus and [**Last Name (un) **]
(humalog contains latex)
.
# Leukocytosis:  Likely from adrenergic demargination from
epinephrine and underlying systemic process. Doubt infection
.
# Microcytic Anemia: [**Month (only) 116**] be iron deficiency anemia given
menstrating female

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1)  patient has many signifcant allergies including those to
latex which is present in many medications (NPH apparently).
2)  if feasible and safe, would recommend fiberoptic exam of
laryngeal structures prior to any future intubations to document
or exclude laryngeal edema.
3)  Needs to follow up with [**Hospital1 112**] allergist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 21734**] C.
[**Last Name (un) **] in 1 week
4)  d/c'd home with 60 mg Prednisone PO for 7 days.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].

You were admitted with anaphylaxis following an exposure to
peanut butter.  Due to progressive difficulty breathing you were
intubated on [**7-22**] and treated with epinephrine and
steroids.  You were extubated the following day but required
re-intubation due to declining blood oxygen saturation.  On [**7-24**] you were extubated again and have been doing well.

When returning home, please continue your home medication
regimen.  Additionally the following changes have been made to
your medication regimen:

Please CONTINUE Prednisone 60mg for 7 days then follow the
instructions of your allergist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Last Name (un) 87092**] and
Women's Hospital.

Please see below for follow-up instructions.

Followup Instructions:
Please schedule a follow up appointment with your allergist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21743**] as soon as possible.
