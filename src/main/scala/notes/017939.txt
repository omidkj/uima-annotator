PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
REASON FOR EXAM: S/P AVR.
Comparison is made to prior study [**2158-8-31**].
Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions
with adjacent atelectasis, left greater than right, are
improved. There is no CHF or pneumothorax.
Ill-defined opacity in the anterior segment right upper lobe is
new, could be atelectasis, attention in this area should be
performed in the followup
studies to exclude developing infection. Sternal wires are
aligned. The
patient is status post AVR.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness:  *1.4 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  *1.4 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. No AS. Moderate to severe
(3+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve is
bicuspid. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to severe
(3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 51319**] [**Known lastname **]
before bypass.

POST-BYPASS:

Preserved biventricular functin LVEF >55%.
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position (#27 per
surgeons) No AI or perivalvular leaks, Peak gradient less than 6
mm Hg on multiple measurements.
Aortic contours are intact.
Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**8-28**] for cardiac cath which showed clean coronaries.
Underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2158-8-29**] for aortic valve
replacement (#27mm [**Company 1543**] mosaic). He was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition on phenylephrine and propofol drips.
Extubated that evening and transferred to the stepdown unit on
POD#2. He was started on a low dose betablocker which was
titrated gently due to asymptomatic hypotension. He was diuresed
toward his pre-op weight. His chest tubes and temporary pacing
wires were removed per protocol. He was evaluated by physical
therpay for strength and consitioning and was cleared for
discharge.  He had some asymptomatic hypotension and his beta
blocker was decreased.  He continued to progress and was
discharged to home is stable condition on POD #7.
