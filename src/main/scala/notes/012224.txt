Chief Complaint:
Tylenol Overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 18yo F with PMHx of asthma and "sado-masochism"
admitted from OSH with APAP overdose. She reports that exactly
one month ago her apartment burned down ruining all of her
belongings and killing her cat. She believes that her
ex-boyfriend may have started the fire. She thought she had
gotten over it but then at about 1 am on [**5-17**] patient took 200+
500mg tablets of tylenol. She notes that she didn't know the
APAP was dangerous and didn't have any intent of killing
herself. She said at the time she was reliving the fire and
wondering if there was anything different she could have done.
After the ingestion she fell asleep and thought she was fine but
the day following the ingestion she was vomiting profusely and
her mother finally convinced her to go to the ER at [**Hospital 1727**]
Medical Center.

In the ED at [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center at 5pm on [**5-17**] her tylenol
level was 119. Her LFTs were elevated with INR 3.6, AST 724, ALT
964. She received zofran and reglan and was started on mucomyst
gtt and D5NS at 100ml/hr. She was transferred to the ICU at MMC
and remained stable overnight. Her APAP level dropped to 26 on
[**5-18**] AM; however, her LFTs increased with INR from 1.6->3.3. She
was seen by the psych service who felt she had PTSD from the
fire she had witnessed and did not feel that she was suicidal.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation by the hepatologists
and transplant service for liver transplant.

On the floor at [**Hospital1 18**], she was feeling well. She denied
suicidality and reiterated that she didn't know how dangerous
APAP was and that she did not want to kill herself.

Studies:
[**5-17**]- CXR from OSH: No acute infiltrates, effusions,
cardiopulmonary congestive changes. No parenchymal nodules or
mediastinal abnormalities.

EKG: sinus bradycardia with sinus arrhythmia and non-diagnostic
Q waves inferiorly

TTE [**5-20**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler
imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
  IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Normal
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

Abd. US w/doppler [**5-20**]:
IMPRESSION: No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation
or focal liver lesions. Normal Doppler examination of the liver.


PA/lateral CXR [**5-20**]:
The heart is normal in size and the lungs are clear without
evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Tylenol OD: LFTs rose dramatically in ICU with peak levels
ALT [**Numeric Identifier 11802**], AST [**Numeric Identifier **], AP 9610, and INR 5.9 on [**5-20**]. T. bili
peaked at 4.5 on [**5-19**]. Was on N-acetylcysteine until INR < 2.0.
Given severity of injury a transplant work-up was initiated,
however given her clinical improvement, was unnecessary. CXR,
TTE, and Abd. US completed and all normal. VZV IgG was positive.
Hep serologies negative, HIV negative, CMV negative and rubella
IgG/IgM serologies negative. EBV positive. LFTs trending down
nicely, INR improved to 1.2 today. Her LFTs have been trending
down daily, and expect them to normalize with time.

2. Psych: Psych history still somewhat unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] h/o cutting
and ? PTSD in setting of recent fire. Was followed by therapist
and psychiatrist in the past although denies any diagnosis. Has
been evaluated by SW and psychiatry here, however has not been
completely cooperative with their evaluation and has poor
insight into her actions. Patient denies overt SA, however
admits that mother attempted suicide with tylenol OD in past.
Per our psychiatrists: Though her insight is markedly limited
and her style of interacting with others is less mature than her
age would suggest, she does not appear to be at immediate risk
for harm to herself at this point. She does not have a major
mood or psychotic disorder to explain her ingestion, rather it
seems to have been related to impulsivity, poor coping, and
limited style of asking for help. She does not want inpatient
psychiatric treatment, is willing to follow up as an outpt
(which we confirmed) and at this point, is not involuntarily
committable to warrant inpatient treatment. She remains at
chronic risk for impulsive actions and difficult interpersonal
interactions however, she does not appear to be at immine
