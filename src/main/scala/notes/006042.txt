Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Fluid Retention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71yo male with hx of DM2, HTN, ESRD s/p transplant reports
gradual onset of increasing fluid overload over the past one
month.  Pt. reports he has had fluid retention in his legs and
abdomen.  He reports increasing fatigue and DOE as well as a dry
cough x 2 days.  Was evaluated in heart failure clinic today
with 17lb. weight gain from baseline.  Patient denies CP, +
right shoulder pain chronically x 1 yr.  Reports decreasing PO
intake, with some nausea over last 2 days w/o vomiting.  No PND,
+ orthopnea if lies on back/left side.  Denies fevers, chills,
diaphoresis, syncope.  Pt. reports his UOP has decreased over
the last 2 days.  He feels that his fatigue and DOE is keeping
him from ambulating as he would at baseline.

[**2109-1-2**] Cardiac Echo:
Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2108-2-29**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Overall  normal LVEF (>55%). TDI E/e' >15, suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild
AS (AoVA
1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular  calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR.  Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is severe symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated.  Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue  Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure  (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve  leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild to
moderate aortic valve  stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The  mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is  seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic  hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-2-29**],
estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
..
..
[**1-1**] CXR:IMPRESSION:  New pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left.  Given confluence of the
edema at the lung bases,
underlying infection cannot be entirely excluded and followup
radiographs
after diuresis is suggested
.
[**1-10**] CXR:There is mild cardiomegaly.  Tortuous calcified aorta
is noted.  Bilateral mild effusions are again noted.  Mild
pulmonary edema, slightly better than prior radiograph.  There
is a left retrocardiac and basilar atelectasis again noted.

IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement of CHF.  Small bilateral
effusions and left retrocardiac and basilar atelectasis persist.

.
[**2109-1-3**] Renal Transplant U/S:
IMPRESSION:  Worsening resistive indices, likely reflecting
chronic rejection. At this time, there is little or no antegrade
diastolic flow. Worsening cortical echogenicity.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16659**] is a 71 year old man with a history of diabetes
mellitus type II now on insulin complicated by chronic kidney
disease, s/p renal transplant in [**2105**], diastolic heart failure
and multiple valvular abnoamrlities, hepatitis C who was
admitted with increased dyspnea on exertion, fatigue and fluid
retention.  The following issues were addressed on this
admission:
.
Cardiovascular: pump: Patient volume overloaded on admission
secondary to his heart failure and renal insufficiency.  Over
first day of hospitalization, patient did not diurese well to
lasix and his blood pressures were poorly controlled in the
170's.  He had an episode of acute pulmonary edema on [**1-2**] and
was started on a lasix drip.  He was admitted on lisinopril and
small dose of metorprolol.  The patient diuresed a few liters on
the drip and was transitioned to metalazone and torsemide and
maintained on these through discharge.  The patient's beta
blocker was converted to carvedilol and titrated to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] but
the patient experienced bradycardia with hypotension at this
dose and thus it was held and then started at lower dose before
discharge. Lisinopril was maintained throughout the
hospitalization at varying doses with variation in renal
function and was for a few days around the time of the patient's
bradycardia with hypotension.  On discharge, he was
significantly less dyspneic and was discharge on lisinopril,
carvedilol, hydralazine and metalazone/torsemide.  Patient was
