History of Present Illness:
67 M with CHF, CRF, DM-2 transferred from an OSH with

epigastric pain associated with 2 bouts of non-bloody, bilious
emesis and diarrhea this morning.  He presented to [**Hospital 1562**]
hospital this morning because his pain was so severe.  He was
found to have a  lipase >3000, tbili 2.4,  ALT/AST of 422/260.
CT abd demonstrates distended GB with edema/inflammation with
concern for cholecystitis.  Given his imaging and lab results
there is concern for gallstone pancreatitis.  He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

[**1-8**] RUQ US: Gallbladder is distended with mural wall edema and
irregular debris/sludge in the lumen but no biliary ductal
dilatation or evidence of stones. These findings are concerning
for acute cholecystitis but can overlap with findings seen in
the setting of pancreatitis. A HIDA Scan can be obtained for
further evaluation.
[**2139-1-8**] PERCUTANEOUS CHOLECYSTOSTOMY WITH ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE
8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was introduced
transhepatically into the gallbladder lumen, yielding
spontaneous drainage of turbid bilious material. Approximately
10 cc were sent to microbiology for further analysis. This was
connected to tubing in gravity and bag yielding 120 cc in total
at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure
well without immediate complication. The patient will be
transferred back to the ER and subsequently to the ICU for
further monitoring.

[**2139-1-18**] Chest xray
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-9**], there is
improved aeration of the lungs. PICC remains in place.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Mild fullness of
pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary
venous pressure. Bibasilar atelectatic changes persist.
Continued opacification is seen along the left lateral pleural
surface.



Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the ACS service. He underwent gallbladder
scan which showed acute cholecystitis with concern for
gangrenous gallbladder. A percutaneous gallbladder drainage
catheter was placed by Radiology.

During his hospital stay he was noted with acute delirium. His
delirium was felt likely secondary to benzodiazepines which were
prescribed during his ICU stay. These medications were weaned
and eventually stopped, Olanzapine was started with improvement
in his mental status. He is currently alert and oriented x2-3.

He remained in the ICU for several days and was then transferred
to the regular nursing unit where he progressed slowly. There
was some concern for possible aspiration noted with meals.
Speech and Swallow consultation was ordered; initial bedside
swallow revealed gross aspiration and he was kept NPO for 2 days
with supplemental IV fluids. He was re-evaluated and his diet
was upgraded to thickened liquids with pureed solids. He does
require supervision for all meals. He has required supplemental
nasal oxygen since his aspiration episode, his chest xray shows
bibasilar atelectasis with opacity in the left lung. He is also
receiving schedule nebulizer treatments. It is expected that he
will be able to wean off of the oxygen while at rehab.

His home medications were restarted; his Zoloft started at a
lower dose for a couple of days with goal of his daily 50mg
dose.

He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and
continues to require rehab after his acute hospital stay.

He is being discharged with the gallbladder drain in place and
will return to [**Hospital 2536**] clinic in 2 weeks for determining if drain
can be removed and also to discuss elective cholecystectomy.
