Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-

History of Present Illness:
This a [**Age over 90 **]y/o female with a history of COPD, hypertension,
gastroespohageal reflux who presented with shortness of breath
and dyspnea on exertion X 3 days.
Per nursing home records, the patient was reported to have had
10cc of hemoptysis. O2 sat was 92%. Patient reports substernal
chest pain radiating to the back, lasting seconds.  By history
the pain is pleuritic, because coughing makes it worse.
.
On presentation peak flow was 140; improved to 240 after 1st neb
in the ED. Chest X-ray  showed multilobular consolidation. CT-A
showed no PE or obstructive bronchial lesion, but central
bilateral consolidation secondary to pneumonia and CHF was
noted. An EKG showed TWI in I and avL, and in V4-V6, unchanged
from previous.  Trop was 0.10 in the setting of renal
insufficiency.

Chest X-ray [**2174-11-25**]
1. Multilobar consolidation, which could reflect asymmetrical
edema and/or multilobar pneumonia. A postobstructive process in
the right middle lobe cannot be excluded. By report, the patient
is scheduled to undergo CTA, which will be helpful for more
complete characterization of these findings.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
.
CT-A [**2174-11-25**]
1. No parenchymal mass lesion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. No
acute pulmonary embolus.

2. Central bilateral consolidation mainly along the inferior
hilar regions with patchy areas of consolidation in the upper
and lower lobes. Enlargement of the central arterial pulmonary
vasculature and mild cardiac enlargement suggestive of
background pulmonary hypertension. Small bibasilar pleural
effusions. These findings may all be due to cardiac failure with
pulmonary hypertension. Infective consolidation should be also
considered depending on the current clinical correlation.
Interval followup post-treatment initially with chest x-ray is
advised.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia
The patient was initially maintained on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia.  Because the
patient came from rehabilitation, the decision was made to
change the antibiotic coverage to Levaquin. Her treatment also
consisted of Q2 nebulizer treatments, oxygen and her home dose
of prednisone.  On the morning of HD #2, the patient's course
was complicated by transient desaturation to 88% on 6L NC and a
shovel mask.  On exam the patient had rhonchorous breath sounds,
difficulty mobilizing her secretions. O2 sats improved with
coughing to 91%.  Despite improvement in her O2 sats, the
patient continued to have labored breathing.  She received 10 of
IV lasix and nebulizer treatments.  O2sats improved to 95-99%
on the same amount of O2.  Respiratory therapy recommmended
humidified air to help loosen the secretions.   Patient course
deteriorated on the morning of HD #3.  02sats were initially
stable in the 90s. The patient became tachypneic breathing at an
average rate of 30. Antibiotic coverage was changed to
Ceftazadine because prelim sputum cultures grew gram negative
rods. Despite lasix, morphine and frequent nebulizer treatments,
patient's O2sats decreased to 86% on 6LNC and 100%NRB. The
decision was made to transfer her to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the pt continued to desaturate to the 80s on NC and
FM. She had one episode of desaturation to the 80s which did not
resolve after one minute. CXR showed mucus plugging of the
entire left lung. Pt was placed on her right side and had
rigorous chest PT, and saturations improved to low 90s. Family
was called in. After several days of pt's respiratory status not
improving, pt's status was discussed with family, who decided to
make her CMO. Pt was placed on morphine gtt and died on [**2174-12-5**]
am surrounded by her family.
.
2. Leukocytosis:
Pt's leukocytosis was likely [**2-2**] to pneumonia and UTI. Pt was
afebrile throughout admission. Pt was placed on levaquin, and
blood cultures were negative.
.
3. Hemoptysis:
Pt had episodes of hemoptysis on the floor, but not in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
This was likely [**2-2**] pneumonia. Pt's Hct stayed stable, and stool
was guaiac negative.
.
4. Chest pain:
Pt had episodes of fleeting, pleuritic chest pain on the floor,
with Trop 0.10, which was likely due to renal insufficiency. The
family and patient agreed not to have any intervention for any
possible cardiac issues.
.
5. Acute renal failure:
Pt's acute renal failure was likely due to a dye load with the
CT. Cr improved with fluids.
.
6. HTN:
Pt was continued on Isordil and norvasc.
.
7. CHF:
Pt had evidence of CHF on CXR, with trace edema on the posterior
aspect of her legs.  She was continued on daily lasix prn.
