Nausea and vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7111**] is a 61 y/o M s/p a recent admission for fatigue with
liver and pleural biopsies significant for poorly differentiated
carcinoma who presents from home with nausea and vomiting. His
symptoms began in [**8-24**], when he presented to an outside hospital
with weight loss, fevers, and chills and was found to have
multiple liver masses that were previously thought to be
abscesses. He is s/p multiple drains and antibiotic courses,
most recently a six week course of ceftriaxone and flagyl
completed on [**12-13**] for presumed liver abscesses. Of note, there
have been no positive cultures from the fluid taken from these
abscesses to date so he has been on empiric antibiotic courses.
He was started on PO cipro on [**12-13**] for a planned 2 week course.

.
Patient reports nausea and dry heaves since [**12-13**] and vomiting
since yesterday. Reports 3-4 episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious
vomiting; no coffee grounds, mostly food contents. Denies
unusual eating habits, reports PO intake had been okay since
discharge. He has also had DOE since that time, with a cough
that has persisted for several months. Denies diarrhea/abd
pain/constipation/melena/hematochezia or fevers and chills. He
also endorses a 60lb unintentional weight loss in the last [**2-15**]
months.
.
In the ED initial VS were: 98.3, 110, 97/58, 16, 97%. He was
given zofran and 2.5L of IVF with improvement in his blood
pressure to 107/57. Labs in the ER were notable for lactate of
2.3, white count of 50.4 with 96% neutrophils, AST of 96, HCT of
24.1 and he was admitted to medicine for management of his n/v.
Vital signs prior to transfer were: 98, 89, 107/57, 16, 100% on
RA.
.
ROS was otherwise essentially negative (no chest pain,
palpitations, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, changes in
color of stool, urine, no rashes, recent travel).

STUDIES:
[**2192-12-18**] CXR: Improved expansion but otherwise relatively stable
exam again demonstrated marked elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm. There is a presumed right pleural effusion with
likely loculated component. However, conceivably these pleural
findings could also reflect a solid component and metastatic
pleural disease cannot be entirely excluded particularly in
light of given history. There is likely associated atelectasis
due to the volume loss at the right lower lobe. An early
developing infiltrate is difficult to entirely exclude, but is
felt less likely.

[**2192-12-18**] CT ABD W CONTRAST: 1. Progression of large complex
hepatic lesion which now occupies greater than 60% of the
hepatic parenchyma. Findings are concordant with recent biopsy
results of poorly differentiated carcinoma. At this point, there
are no imaging features suggestive of abscess. 2. Increase in
size and of numerous pulmonary nodules seen on limited views of
the lung bases. 3. New appearance of multiple mesenteric
implants suggestive of metastatic disease.

[**2192-12-19**] R HIP XR: Longitudinally oriented lucency with ground
glass internal matrix and thick sclerotic rim. The appearance is
most suggestive of fibrous dysplasia rather than metastasis.
Lucency in the left sacral ala most likely represents bowel gas,
but repeat pelvic film within the next several weeks could help
to confirm this.

[**2192-12-20**] CXR: The right basal metastatic deposits are
redemonstrated, surrounded by lymphangitic spread of the tumor.
No new consolidations have been seen. The left lung is
unchanged. No new effusion or pneumothorax have been
demonstrated.

[**2192-12-21**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Anterolateral ST segment
elevation suggests an acute injury pattern. Consider acute
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2192-12-5**] sinus tachycardia and ST segment elevation are new.

[**2192-12-21**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effu
