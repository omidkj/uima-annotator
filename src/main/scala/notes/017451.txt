On [**2181-9-20**], the patient underwent a
transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed normal left
ventricular ejection fraction with no vegetation or
abscesses.  Also at that time, the patient became tachypneic
and anxious with his attempt to use a passing uric valve on
his tracheostomy.  This attempt was aborted to be retried at
a later date by a speech therapist in the rehabilitation
facility.  The infectious disease service signed off the case
since the patient had remained afebrile for a number of days
at this time.  From [**9-21**] through [**9-23**] the
patient continued with a slow pressure support wean.

On [**2181-9-24**], the patient again had a fever of
101.7??????.  He became anxious and tachypneic.  He was sedated
and placed back on IMV ventilator support.  He was recultured
at that time.  One out of two blood cultures grew coagulase
positive Staphylococcus which was felt to be a contaminant.
The patient has also had a subsequent blood culture which was
negative.  The patient at that time also had a sputum culture
which grew coagulase positive Staphylococcus.  Since the
patient clinically improved, he remained afebrile without an
elevation in his white count.  He was not started on
antibiotics for this new finding.  On [**9-25**], the
patient remained afebrile.  His respiratory status had
stabilized and his ventilator was changed back to pressure
support ventilation.

Today, [**2181-9-26**], the patient remains afebrile and
hemodynamically stable, ready to be transferred to a
rehabilitation facility.  His physical examination is
essentially unchanged from previous documentation.  His most
recent laboratory values are from today, [**2181-9-26**]
which are as follows:  White blood cell count 8.6000,
hematocrit 27.6, platelet count 206.  PT 13.5, INR 1.2,
sodium 135, potassium 3.9, chloride 99, CO2 32, BUN 28,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 137.  His digoxin level is 0.9.
