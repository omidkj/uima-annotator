Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of triple lumen central venous line
Transesophageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**] is a 57 year-old man with no significant past
medical history apart from hypertension. For the past year he
has noticed increasing DOE. He has an active job as a painter
and was newly unable to climb 1 flight of stairs or walk across
a building without stopping to catch his breath. Dyspnea is
occasionally accompanied by dry or slightly productive cough
with white sputum, which he attributes to postnasal drip. He
denies accompanying CP, palpitation, or wheezing. He saw his PCP
for these complaints and was given an albuterol inhaler. He is
not certain if this helped.
.
Over the past two months, Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**] has been feeling
increasingly short of breath with less and less exertion. Today,
he was even having trouble breathing at rest so he presented to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He denies any chest pain or palpitations.
Also for the past 2 months, Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**] has noted testicular
swelling and pain. This progressed to the point where he could
hardly walk and had trouble positioning himself to urinate. He
denies any pain with urination or defecation. He is not sexually
active.
For the past 2 days he has had increasing abdominal distention.
He continues to have baseline abdominal pain at the site of his
mesh that is unchanged, although he is uncomfortable from the
distention.
.
Of note, he also burned his L lower leg in the bathtub 2 weeks
ago. For the past few days his entire L lower leg has become
more painful and red.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: T 98.2, BP 100/77, HR 60
(unclear if correct [**Location (un) 1131**]), RR 24, O2 Sat 93% o n RA
He was found to be in rapid afib to the 170s. His exam was also
notable for apparent left lower extremity cellulitis. He had
whole body including significant scrotal edema. Lung exam
demonstrated rales. Labs were notable for lactate 2.6, INR 1.9,
WBC 18, elevated LFTs, and creatinine 1.5 (no prior electrolytes
or LFTs in our system). CT of torso was concerning for pneumonia
vs volume overload as well as a subsegmental PE.
.
Arterial line and central venous line were placed. For his
persistent mild hypotension and rapid afib, he received 3 L NS.
He was quite hypoxic with O2 Sat falling to 80% on NC; thus
facemask O2 was started with good O2 Sat. Because of the
hypoxia, hypotension, amd evidence of (albeit small) PE, heparin
gtt was started. He was also given vancomycin 1 g, unasyn 3 g,
and levofloxacin 750 mg IV for both the cellulitis and
pneumonia. For the atrial fibrillation, he was given 10 mg of
diltiazem followed by a diltiazem drip that was initially as
high as 15 mg/h, titrated down to 5 mg/h.

He was admitted to the MICU for further evaluation and
management. His vital signs prior to transfer to were 101,
95/61, 20, 98% on NRB
