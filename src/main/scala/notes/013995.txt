Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Dilantin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness and numbness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 83 year old right handed woman s/p a recent R parietal
hemorrhage ([**7-10**]) in the setting of coumadin therapy, and
residual L sided weakness, who presents with new large R frontal
and intraventricular hemorrhage. She was eating breakfast on
[**9-3**], when she suddenly developed slurred speech, L arm and leg
weakness as well as numbness. No complaints of headache. She was
taken to an OSH where her initial GCS was 14. She became
progressively more somnolent and then vomited, at which time she
was intubated. She was premedicated with lidocaine, fentanyl,
succ, etomidate, propofol and vecuronium for intubation. She is
allergic to dilantin, and was given ativan for seizure
prophylaxis, although no hx of seizure.

ROS negative for recent illness. During her hospitalization from
[**7-17**] to [**7-26**] she also had a UTI that was treated. She was d/c'ed
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-26**] to rehab with notable L homonymous
hemianopsia.

Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. Hypercholesterolemia
3. DVTs (multiple) on coumadin, INR difficult to control per
daughters, recent INR was in the range of 4.
4. Breast cancer [**2114**] s/p lumpectomy, XRT and tamoxifen. No
chemotherapy. No recurrence known.
5. Left hip replacement.
6. Recent diagnosis of CML after w/u of elevated WBC


Social History:
Patient is a very active woman who lives with a family member
but has been largely independent with most ADLs. Widow, has five
children. No known tobacco, EtOH, or illicit drug use.


Family History:
Brother - lymphoma. Son, daughter - DVTs, PE. Multiple family
members with CAD.

Physical Exam:
Physical exam on admission:
BP 210/66  HR 55  RR 16
Intubated, sedated with propofol. No evidence of head trauma.
Heart - RRR no m/r/g
Lungs - diminshed breath sounds at bases bilaterally
Abd - soft, NT/ND
Ext - warm and well perfused.

Neuro:
Not responsive to loud voice or sternal rub. R Pupil 2 mm, L
pupil 3 mm, both minimally reactive. R gaze preference, but EOMI
to dolls maneuver. +sluggish corneals bilaterally.
Minimal grimace to nasal tickle. No gag or cough. To nailbed
pressure,
withdraws RUE, extensor posturing of LUE, triple flexion in LE
bilaterally. Upgoing toes bilaterally. No spontaneous mvmts.

[**9-8**]
U/A mod blood, +nitrite, tr protein, mod leukocytes, 11-20 WBCs

[**9-3**] Head CT - 1. New large right frontal lobe intraparenchymal
hematoma with associated intraventricular hemorrhage and slight
shift of midline structures leftward. 2. Small bilateral
subarachnoid hemorrhage in the frontal lobe regions. 3. Old
hematoma site in the right parietal lobe.

[**9-4**] Head CT - Unchanged right frontal lobe hematoma. There is
extensive adjacent vasogenic edema, with extension of acute
blood into the ventricular system, especially at the ipsilateral
lateral ventricle. Increased acute blood is also seen extending
into the subarachnoid spaces at the cerebral sulci bilaterally.
Prominence of the lateral ventricles and temporal horns persist,
and acute blood is again noted within the third and fourth
ventricles.

[**9-8**] CXR - Right lower lobe progressive consolidation,
concerning for an evolving site of pneumonia. Persistent left
retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to atelectasis or
additional site of pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 year old woman with large R frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with diffuse intraventricular
extension and also subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Neuro - The patient's R frontal hemorrhage (a second hemorrhage
within 2 months), is most likely related to amyloid angiopathy.
She was evaluated by Neurosurgery in the ED; no surgical
intervention was recommended. Hyperventilated, received Mannitol
from [**9-3**] - 10/. Mild increase in edema and increased
subarachnoid hemorrhage on [**9-4**] head CT. Seizure prophylaxis
with Depakote was initiated (Dilantin allergy). Sedation with
Propofol was stopped on [**9-4**], but the patient remained minimally
responsive throughout the hospitalization.

CV - Goal SBP 130-150 initially maintained with nipride drip in
the ED; transitioned to a Labetalol drip upon admission.

Resp - Intubated, ventilated to goal pCO2 25-30. [**9-8**] CXR
revealed right lower lobe pneumonia.

FEN/GI - Initially NPO, received Famotidine. NGT feeds started
on [**9-6**].

ID - Febrile to 102 on [**9-8**]. In addition to pneumonia on CXR,
U/A c/w likely UTI.

Heme - HCT was 38.3 on admission, decreased to 25.9 on [**9-8**].
Blood loss possibly due to increasing intracranial hemorrhage,
GI losses, marrow infiltration related to CML, among other
etiologies.

Code status changed to DNR on [**9-4**]. Given the patient's poor
prognosis related to her large hemorrhage, once fever developed
on [**9-8**], and there was new evidence of likely pneumonia and UTI,
the family decided to transition to comfort measures only. The
patient was extubated, a morphine drip was initiated and
titrated for comfort. Additional medications, interventions, and
workup of anemia/infection were stopped. The patient died on
[**9-8**] after cardiorespiratory arrest, several hours after
extubation.
