.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo F with alcholic cirrhosis admitted with lower GI bleed.
.
1. Abdominal pain: Developed while on steroids, however may be
related to abdominal distention or bloating. High likelyhood of
SBP given alcoholic cirrhosis and high discriminate factor but
per ultrasound small ascites, hence no paracentesis.
Pt afebrile, less pain, stable abdominal bloating which patient
associates with starting predisone therapy. Patient received no
additional benefit from lactulose 60ml TID; therefore,
maintained on 30 ml TID. Patient tolerated increased in
furosemide to 40mg daily, home regimen 20mg 3x weekly.
.
2. Alcoholic hepatitis/cirrhosis: With associated complications
including coagulopathy, encephalopathy. Encephalopathy improved
during stay, however total bilirubin was increasing after
hematocrit had stabilized. Prednisone 40mg started due to high
discriminate factor. Acute improvement of T.bili after
initiation of steroids. Continued patient on lactulose, nadolol
and started ursodiol. Continued furosemide & spironolactone
daily. Encouraged adequate nutrition with calorie counts x 3
days ~ 2000kcal daily. At time of discharge T. bili 10.1.
-- Patient discharged AMA on Prednisone taper starting [**10-26**]
-- To follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] [**Name (STitle) 2974**] [**10-27**].
.
3. GI bleed: In the setting of alcoholic hepatitis/cirrhosis.
Transferred from [**Hospital6 **] with melanic stools,
underwent EGD which showed grade I cords but no bleeding, also
gastritis. Transitioned from IV pantoprazole to oral daily
dosing. Hematocrit levels have remained stable ~ 30. Continued
nadolol.
.
4. Anemia: Baseline 37 in [**Month (only) 404**] but 27 in [**Month (only) 958**]. Likely a
mixture from cirrhosis and blood-loss. B12 high, folate normal.
Patient did not require a packed red blood cell transfusion. EDG
did not show active bleeding.
.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Most likely related to liver disease &
splenic sequestration.
Required a bag of platelets and unit of fresh frozen plasma on
admission [**10-12**]. Afterward patient stabilized.
.
6. Hyponatremia: Most likely r/t liver disease, stable. Pt
mildly encephalopathic on admission, however improved daily with
lactulose. No severe mental status changes.
.
7. Alcoholism: Poor liver candidate due to continued alcoholism.
On admission received one banana bag and placed on CIWA scale.
Required several doses of benzodiazepines initially, but no
doses needed after 48 hours. Patient last drink over one week
prior to discontinuation of CIWA scale on [**10-23**]. Did not require
any ativan after transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Continued on thiamine,
folate, mvi. Social work consulted to assist with addiction and
therapy for alcohol abuse. Patient not interested in any
assistance with her addiction and would routinely deny that she
had been drinking prior to admission.
.
8. Hypertension: Well controlled on nadolol daily for esophageal
prophylaxis
.
9. Left hip pain: Left hip & back pain chronic, has seen
orthopedics at [**Hospital1 112**] and they have recommended a left hip
replacement when the pain becomes severe. Patient was told pain
due to avascular necrosis by her primary care physician not by
orthopedics. Pain controlled with oxycodone as needed and
neurontin.
.
10. Left leg swelling: Complained of leg swelling [**10-22**] LLE LENI
negative for clot. Suspect component of fluid retention due to
prednisone. Patient to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] on [**Last Name (STitle) 2974**] [**10-27**].

.
11. Breast Cancer: s/p lumpectomy, no chemo/rads per pt, Pt to
f/u with oncologist at [**Hospital3 328**]. Had lumpectomy [**2111**], recent
mammogram showed densities that
requires surgical biopsy. Pt to reschedule surgery. Oncologist
at
[**Hospital3 328**] Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5627**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
12. Breast Cancer: s/p lumpectomy, no chemo/rads per patient.
Recent mammogram showed densities that requires surgical biopsy.
Patient to schedule surgery. Oncologist at [**Hospital3 328**] is Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5627**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
13. FEN: Patient fluid resusitated on admission, and
electrolytes were aggressively repleted.
