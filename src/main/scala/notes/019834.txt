History of Present Illness:
Briefly, 44yo man with h/o DM1, ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD s/p BKA
[**6-25**], ?CVA 2y PTA after p/w first seizure, multiple seizures
since, who p/w malaise, confusion, tremors concerning for sz, to
OSH ED. Patient had R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass [**6-15**] and then BKA on [**6-24**]
at [**Hospital1 18**]. He was d/c'd to [**Hospital **] Rehab for 1 week, where starting
several days PTA he began c/o increased urinary frequency and
urgency x several days, but unclear if he produced urine.  Then
2d PTA had an episode of CP, SOB, diaphoresis, occasional
jerking movements of his extremities and fasciculations of his
abdominal muscles in context of elevated BP post-HD, which
resolved spontaneously. On the day PTA, pt again had jerking
movements, became increasingly confused, prompting his wife to
bring him to the [**Hospital6 5016**] ED. In the OSH, he was
noted to be "writhing," which decreased with ativan x 5 mg. Also
received one dose of levofloxacin for presumed UTI, and blood cx
was sent. Had a negative head CT at OSH. Because of hypertension
to SBP 220s, he was started on his home agents, then changed to
nitroprusside. He was also started on insulin gtt for elevated
fsbg in 300s. Patient was intubated to protect airway, then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU at family's request.

Reports:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-7-26**] 3:32 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly and mild congestive heart failure versus volume
overload. Stable right pleural effusion.
2. Right-sided PICC with tip in mid SVC.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2156-7-26**] 1:37 PM
IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema, which may be due to
volume overload in this patient with history of end-stage renal
disease.

FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT  [**2156-7-25**] 11:06 AM
IMPRESSION: Simple fluid collection within the right groin.

CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**2156-7-24**] 9:17 PM
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 4.4 x 4.5 cm low-density rounded lesion within the
right inguinal region. This could represent a pseudoaneurysm or
a mass, however, as contrast was not administered, its
enhancement characteristics cannot be determined. Superinfection
of the lesion cannot be excluded. An ultrasound of this mass is
recommended.

ECG Study date [**2156-7-23**]  5:29:48 PM
Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. Left anterior fascicular
block. Left ventricular hypertrophy with associated ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-7-18**] left axis
deviation is now present.

Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2156-7-23**]
IMPRESSION: This is a moderately abnormal EEG due to the
presence of
bifrontal and widespread slowing superimposed upon a slow
background.
This pattern is most consistent with a mild to moderate
encephalopathy
of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. The technologist did
not note
any episodes of unusual movements, and no evidence for ongoing
seizures
was seen.

[**2156-7-19**] Radiology ART DUP EXT UP UNI LMTD RIGHT   IMPRESSION:
1. Mild fusiform enlargement of the proximal portion of the
right subclavian artery, corresponding to a diameter of 150 per
cent as compared to the contralateral side. This corresponds to
a borderline value for the definition of an aneurysm. No mural
thrombus is seen.
2. Incidental note of the presence of a PICC line in the right
subclavian vein.

[**2156-7-18**] Cardiology ECG Sinus rhythm
Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave
abnormalities
Since previous tracing of [**2156-7-12**], baseline artifact seen

[**2156-7-18**] Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is a normal
routine EEG obtained in wakefulness and brief stage II sleep. No
lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were seen.

[**2156-7-16**] Radiology MR HEAD INTERPRETATION: Limited examination
due to motion artifact. No intracranial masses visualized. No
acute stroke is seen. Few foci of increased T2 signal in the
periventricular white matter which may be related to chronic
hypertension versus chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Opacification of both mastoid air cells.
INTERPRETATION: MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431*
