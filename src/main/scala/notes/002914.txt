Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1190**]
Chief Complaint:
72 year old male admitted on [**2122-7-12**] with right iliac stent
artery aneurysm with a cheif complaint of back pain and mild
shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2122-7-13**]- Endovascular stent graft repair of right common iliac
artery with extender stend into external iliac artery and
hypogastric artery embolization.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 72 year old male s/p AAA orininally presented on
[**2122-5-19**] for SOB, and a CTA of the A/P at that time demonstrated
a RCI aneurysm.  Pt was instructed to follow up at a later date,
as this was not deemed an emergent issue.  On [**2122-6-11**], he
presented for a CAT and IV fluids for his RI.  He was then
discharged and told to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  On [**2122-7-12**],
the pt arrived to have his RCI aneurysm endvascularly repaired.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -59 DISTINCT PROCEDURAL SERVIC

Reason: Locate central and r/o pneumo

AP SUPINE CHEST: Comparison to AP upright chest of 8 hours
prior. There has been interval intubation with the ETT tip 5 cm
above the carina. Right IJ line seen with its tip distal SVC. No
pneumothorax is identified, though limited assessment due to
severe emphysema and overlying tubes. Severe upper lobe bullous
emphysema. There remains bibasilar opacities, which may be
secondary to chronic emphysema, however, it is difficult to
exclude an element of mild CHF/volume overload superimposed on
background emphysematous changes. No pneumonia is seen. There is
a persisting left retrocardiac opacity, which is unchanged
dating back to multiple prior chest x-rays.

IMPRESSION:
1) ETT and right IJ in satisfactory position; no pneumothorax
identified, though limited assessment due to emphysema and
overlying tubes.
2) Equivocal mild CHF/volume overload superimposed on background
emphysema. No new pneumonia. Unchanged appearance of left
retrocardiac opacity. Follow-up again recommended to ensure
resolution is recommended.


ECHO

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.1 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.5 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 4.8 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)

Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.0 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% to 60% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: 3.1 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aorta - Ascending: *3.5 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.5 m/sec
Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.0 m/sec
Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 0.50
Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 252 msec
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): <= 25 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)

Findings:

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting
LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No mass or
vegetation on mitral valve. Trivial MR. LV inflow pattern c/w
impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.


Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is probably normal. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2122-7-14**], there  is probably no change.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. If clinically
indicated, a TEE would better to exclude a small valve
vegetation.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: SOB

PROCEDURE: CT of the chest.

INDICATION: Tachycardic and tachypnic with shortness of breath.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector noncontrast low-dose images of the
chest, and contrast-enhanced images of the chest following rapid
bolus administration of 100 cc of IV Optiray were performed.
Images are reformatted in the sagittal and coronal planes.

IV CONTRAST: Nonionic IV Optiray contrast was used for rapid
bolus administration.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is severe
emphysematous change throughout the lungs, with marked bullous
formation in the upper lobes as well as anteriorly towards the
lung bases. No pulmonary embolism is identified. There are no
areas of consolidation. There are no pleural effusions. There is
a focal 1.2 cm opacity seen in the periphery of the lingula, not
seen on prior study of [**2122-5-11**]. The aorta is markedly
tortuous, and is seen to have mass effect on the left atrium as
before, which might compromise venous return. There is mild
dilatation of both main pulmonary arteries indicative of
pulmonary hypertension. The right pulmonary artery measures 2.5
cm, and the left 2.2 cm. There is no pneumothorax. No
pericardial effusion. Within the imaged portions of the upper
abdomen, no abnormalities are identified.

Bone windows show no suspicious lesions.

Some secretions are noted within the trachea and right main stem
bronchus.

MULTIPLANAR REFORMATTED IMAGES: Images reformatted in the
sagittal and coronal planes show no evidence of pulmonary
embolism. No aortic aneurysm or dissection identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism identified.
2. Severe emphysema with marked bullous changes particularly at
the upper lobes and in the lower thorax anteriorly.
3. Focal 1.2 cm opacity in the periphery of the left lingula,
not seen previously. While this may represent atelectasis or an
inflammatory opacity, short-term followup in one to two months
is recommended to ensure stability or resolution.
