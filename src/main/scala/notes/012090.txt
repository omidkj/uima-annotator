CXR

FINDINGS:

AP single view of the chest has been obtained with the patient

previous AP and lateral chest examination of [**2195-6-21**].
Marked cardiac enlargement including left [**Year (4 digits) **] dilatation and
permanent pacer with single intracavitary electrode are
unchanged. No significant pulmonary vascular congestion is
identified. On previous examination, suspected faint infiltrate
in the left lower lobe area has not progressed. The mostly
linear densities in this area most likely represent a crowded
_____ some linear atelectasis related to the marked cardiac
enlargement. Similar horizontally oriented plate atelectasis are
seen on the right lung base are unchanged. None of these
describe pulmonary abnormalities are unlikely to represent a
pneumonia responsible for the patient's symptoms.
