Allergies:
Remicade

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Blocked picc line and fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R Midline access placement

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a 52 year old female with a history of
Crohn's disease and multiple abdominal surgeries, now with short
gut syndrome on chronic TPN. The patient also has a history of
difficulty with chronic venous access.  She reports that for the
past few weeks, she has noted that one of the lumens of her PICC
is "clogged."  Earlier today, the patient went to [**Hospital **]
Hospital for further evaluation.  The patient states that she
was informed that the other lumen of her PICC was "blocked."
The patient has undergone previous recanalization of her veins
by IR in the past, so she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  On
presentation, she was noted to have a SBP in the 60s.  She
reported having a T=104 at home earlier in the day.  She also
reported feeling "weak" over the past few days.  Multiple
attempts were made to obtain L subclavian access, yet these
attempts were unsuccessful, so a L femoral line was placed and
the patient was given aggressive IVFs (5 L total in ED).  She
was also placed on Levophed.  Her BPs improved to 90s/50s.  Of
note, the patient states that her baseline SBP is around 90.
The patient's labs were notable for a leukocytosis and a
positive UA.  The patient was administered doses of Vanco, Levo,
and Flagyl.  She has been transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.

A/P:  The patient is a 52 year old female with a h/o Crohn's
disease and multiple abdominal surgeries, with short gut
syndrome and chronic venous access issues.  She has been
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of sepsis.
.
#Sepsis:
Likely due to line infection, though there is also the
possibility of an early LLL pneumonia.  Patient cites a h/o
chronic diarrhea, but would also consider possibility of C diff
colitis. Will continue empiric coverage with Vanco, Flagyl, and
Levaquin and f/u blood cx data. Will also obtain fungal cx given
h/o chronic TPN use and risk of fungemia.  At present, pt's
hypotension is responding to IVF resuscitation, so will wean
Levophed with goal to keep SBP>90 (pt's baseline) and UO>30
cc/hr.
,
#Access:
Pt currently has L femoral line due to difficulty obtaining L
subclavian vein access.  Will need to contact IR re: venous
access issues.  PICC will need to be removed and tip sent for
culture.
,
#Chronic diarrhea:
Will send sample for C diff, though suspect her diarrhea is
related to her short gut syndrome. Will continue patient's
antidiarrheal medications. Patient is on empiric Flagyl.
.
#Anxiety/depression:
Will continue outpt Psych meds.
.
#Chronic pain:
Confirmed pain medication dosages with patient. Will continue
her methadone and oxycodone.
.
#Anemia:
Patient has h/o anemia with baselne HCT  26-29 w/ MCV 95. Anemia
likely related to her chronic illness, but possible nutritional
deficiency.  Will continue Fe supplement. Will check B12/folate
levels.
.
#Metabolic acidosis:
VBG notable for CO2=60, possibly related to pt's somnolence.
Will obtain repeat VBG.
.
#Prophylaxis:
PPI and SQ Heparin.
.
#Dispo:
ICU.
