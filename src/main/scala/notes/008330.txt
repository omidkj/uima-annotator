Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2200-8-29**] - Aortic valve replacement with a size 19 [**Doctor Last Name **]
Magna tissue valve.


History of Present Illness:
88 y/o female who sustained a syncopal fall in which she
fractured her right humurus. As she is known to have aortic
stenosis with the most recent echo showing critical aortic
stenosis, it was decided to keep her in house to perform her
aortic valve surgery.

Past Medical History:
Hypothyroid
AS
CHF
AF
Hyperlipidemia
HTN


Social History:
Retired. Never smoked and does not drink alcohol. Lives with
daughter.

Family History:
Unremarkable

Physical Exam:
53 SR  16  104/44
GEN: WDWN elderly female in NAD
SKIN: Warm, dry, no clubbing or cyanosis. Multiple solar/actinic
kertosis and  nevi.
HEENT: PERRL, Anicteric sclera, right orbit with large,
ecchymotic area. OP Benign
NECK: Supple, no JVD, FROM.
LUNGS: CTA bilaterally, mild kyphosis.
HEART: RRR, III/VI SEM
ABD: Soft, ND/NT/NABS
EXT:warm, well perfused, no bruits, no varicosities, mild
peripheral edema. Right should ecchymosis at area of her
fracture.
NEURO: No focal deficits.

Pertinent Results:
[**2200-8-21**] - Carotid Ultrasound
There is a less than 40% right ICA stenosis and less than 40%
left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow in both vertebral
arteries.

[**2200-8-21**] - XRAY
Minimally displaced right proximal humerus fracture through the
greater tuberosity.

[**2200-8-25**] - Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
did not
reveal any flow limiting coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD,
LCx,
and RCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
2. Resting hemodynamic measurement revealed mildly elevated left
and
right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 15 mm Hg and an
RVEDP of
12 mm Hg. The mean PCWP was moderately elevated at 25 mm Hg. The
mean
PASP was mildly elevated at 30 mm Hg. There was severe aortic
valve
stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 64 mm Hg and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of
0.44
cm2. The Fick cardiac index was preserved at 2.51 L/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography did not demonstrate any wall motion
abnormalities. The LVEF was calculated at 63%.

[**2200-8-29**] ECHO
Prebypass:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe aortic stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**1-28**]+)aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild valvular mitral
stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The vena contracta measures 0.6cm.

Postbypass:

There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. There is
no aortic
insufficiency or perivalvular leak seen. Peak gradient is 7mmHg
with a mean gradient of 4mmHg. Preserved bioventricular
function. Aortic contours are intact. All findings were
discussed with [**Month/Day (2) 5059**] at time of exam.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7657**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-8-20**] via transfer from
[**Hospital6 5016**] for surgical management of her aortic
stenosis. TShe was worked-up in the usual preoperatiove manner
including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed less then 40%
bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. She [**Hospital6 1834**] a
cardiac catheterization in preparation for surgery on [**2200-8-25**]
which showed normal coronaries, severe aortic stenosis and an
LVEF of 63%. The orthopedic service was consulted given her
recent right humurus fracture. A sling was applied with
follow-up scheduled for 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**]. In
anticipation of valve replacement, the dental service was
consulted for oral clearance for surgery. After performinhg an
exam and obtaining radiograpghs, it was recommended that 2 or 3
teeth be extracted prior to her valve surgery. On [**2200-8-28**], Ms.
[**Known lastname 7657**] [**Known lastname 1834**] extraction of several teeth by the dental
service. Please see operative note for details. She was then
cleared for surgery. On [**2200-8-29**], Ms. [**Known lastname 7657**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an aortic
valve replacement using a 19mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Pericardial Valve.
Please see separate dictated operative note for details.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Within 24 hours, Ms. [**Known lastname 7657**] had awoken neurologically
intact and was extubated. On postoperative day two, she was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. Ms. [**Known lastname 7657**]
was gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with her
postoperative strength and mobility. She was ready for discharge
to rehab on [**9-2**].
