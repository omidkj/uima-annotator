Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1572**]
Chief Complaint:
  CHF exacerbation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right and left heart cathterization.


History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year old gentleman with CAD s/p stent x 2 (LAD,
RCA), s/p pacemaker for LBBB/syncope, HTN, h.o. MI ([**2070**])
presented to the ED from his cardiologist's office with
worsening shortness of breath.
.
He was feeling in his usual state of health until two weeks ago
when he noted progressive dyspnea on exertion that was apparent
at rest. He has had no medications changes, changes in diet.  He
has had no symptoms of chest pain recently and has not required
use of his SL NTG.  His symptoms have been associated with
exacerbation of an underlying cough that is worse at night and
associated w/ clear phlegm and chronic blood streaking.  He
reports worsening intermitant abdominal cramping and diarrhea.
He denies fevers but notes night-time chills. He has had no
episodes of chest pain during this period. He denied symptoms of
heart failure including symptoms of PND, orthopnea or peripheral
edema.  He is able to lie flat with one pillow. Last friday, his
son was concerned regarding his father's increasing shortness of
breath and called his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who recommended
coming in for his regularly scheduled appointment today.
.
His recent cardiac history is significant for a recent
hospitalization in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year. He had a full workup done
including a coronary angiogram that showed significant stenosis
to the RCA and LAD, with two drug-eluting stents placed.He was
noted to have a new MR murmur at this time.  An outside echo at
that time was reported to have an EF of 20%.  Unfortunately, an
echocardiogram was not done here.  It was felt that it was most
likely ischemic and his medical regimen was adjusted.  This
[**2111-8-5**] he had a repeat echocardiogram done that shows an
EF of 43%, 4+ mitral regurgitation as well as a significant
elevated PA pressures
.
At his cardiology appointment today, his shortness of breath
acutely decompensated.  He was placed on an oxygen face mask
with desaturations to the 70s.  He was referred to the emergency
department where vital signs were significant for HR 97
 190/130 41 70% on facemask. Chest x-ray showed hypervolemia,
pulmonary vascular congestion. A ABG was obtained which showed
respiratory acidosis with a pH 7.20, pCO2 69, pO2 31, HCO3 28,
lactate 2.1.(felt to be venous) CBC showed no abnormalities,
chemistry panel showed Cr 1.7 and hyperglycemia.  A nitro gtt
was started, he was given 40mg IV lasix and 4mg of morphine. He
put out 250 cc urine prior to tranfer to the CCU.  An EKG was
significant for old LBBB and HR 65.  He was started on Bipap
with saturation of 99%.
.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2112-1-11**]
FINDINGS: AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. A
single-lead
pacer device appears unchanged and the distal portion of the
lead is poorly assessed given underpenetration. There is
pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema with bilateral
small pleural effusions, right greater than left. No definite
pneumothorax. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
.
IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with congestive heart failure.
..
CXR [**2112-1-12**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-11**], there is mild
improvement of the still substantial congestive heart failure.
Single-lead pacer device is again seen.
.
.
Echo [**2112-1-12**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal and
anterior hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40-45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-8-12**],
severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has decreased.
Pulmonary pressures are lower.
.
CT Torso w/o Contrast [**2112-1-14**]
1. Moderate calcification within the aortic arch, in this
patient who is
preop for mitral valve replacement.
2. Small nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis.
3. Subpleural ground glass opacities, which can be seen with
nonspecific
interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP).
