2. Status post myocardial infarction.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post motor vehicle crash.
2. Status post myocardial infarction.
3. Status post coronary artery bypass graft x5.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 59-year-old male
who had complaints of angina recently.  He was admitted
through the Emergency Department in Trauma Services after
hitting a house.  The patient did have loss of consciousness,
but was awake when EMS arrived.  Patient was taken to [**Hospital3 6265**], where he had a negative head CT scan, but
electrocardiogram changes in the lateral leads.  He also had
a chin laceration which was sutured.

The patient was given Lopressor, nitroglycerin, Lovenox,
aspirin, and had a chin laceration, and developed
ecchymosis/hematoma.  He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Angina.
2. Hypertension.
3. Increased cholesterol.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin.
2. Zestril.
3. Lipitor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival, the patient is a middle
aged elderly man who was in no acute distress.  Heart rate
93, blood pressure 134/88, respirations 18, and 95% on room
air.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Laceration to chin.
Extraocular movements are intact.  Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light.  Anicteric.  Throat is clear.  Neck is
without masses or lymphadenopathy.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular is regular, rate,
and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Pelvis was stable.  Rectal
examination revealed normal tone and guaiac negative.
Extremities are warm, well perfused, and nonedematous x4.
Back had no step-offs and no tenderness.  Neurologically
intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Complete blood count:
7.5/45.8/278.  Chemistries:  142/5.4/3.4/106/24/11/1.0/158.
CPK is 182 and troponin-I is 0.14.

Head CT scan from outside hospital reveals no bleed and no
fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted as a
trauma transfer.  However, elevated cardiac enzymes ruled in
for myocardial infarction.  CT scan and chest x-ray were
normal.  Patient was begun on aspirin, beta blocker, ACE
inhibitor, statin, Heparin drip, and nitropaste versus
unstable angina and myocardial infarction.

Cardiac catheterization was planned with likely concomitant
EP study for possible ICD placement.  Given the mechanism of
injury and his cardiac risk factors, it is thought that the
patient's motor vehicle accident was probably likely due to
myocardial infarction or arrhythmia leading to loss of
consciousness, loss of control of his vehicle.  The patient
did have IV Integrilin begun.  Diagnosis was made by the
Division of Cardiology of a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.

On [**2159-12-30**], the patient's serial troponins came back on 30.7
and 26.1.  CKs of 445 and 440 respectively.  MB fractions and
index were also elevated.

In the early morning of [**2160-1-1**], the patient complained of a
dull ache in his right upper extremity.  It was evaluated to
be a hematoma, features of right upper extremity swelling,
ecchymosis.  Orthopedics was consulted and recommended only
compression dressings.  No evidence of compartment syndrome.

Later on [**2160-1-1**], the patient had cardiac catheterization
performed.  Cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel
coronary artery disease with left ventricular systolic
dysfunction.  No interventions were performed and the patient
was referred for RV vascularization.  Ejection fraction was
calculated to be 30-35% by echocardiogram.  Throughout this
time, the patient was maintained on a Heparin drip, stopping
in the preprocedure period for the cardiac catheterization.

The patient had coronary artery bypass graft x5 performed on
[**2160-1-3**] with LIMA to the left anterior descending artery,
left radial to diagonal, OM sequential, and saphenous vein
graft to the RPL, PDA sequential.  Patient was transferred to
the Recovery Room on Levophed, milrinone, nitroglycerin, and
propofol drips.

Postoperative day #1, the patient remained on multiple drips
and PEEP was increased.  Lopressor was begun for tachycardia.
Patient was extubated on postoperative day #1 without
incident.  Patient remained fairly tachycardic despite
receiving Hespan and po Lopressor.  Urine output also
remained low despite given Hespan and Lasix.

Postoperative day #3, the patient was transferred to the
floor.  Patient had multiple episodes of tachycardia and was
evaluated by Cardiology and EP.
