Pertinent Results:
EKG ([**2-10**]): Baseline artifact in lead VI. Sinus rhythm. Left
atrial abnormality. Left axis deviation - left anterior
fascicular block. Anteroseptal myocardial infarction with ST-T
wave configuration consistent with an acute process. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2155-6-9**]
left axis deviation and anterior ST-T wave changes of acute
injury are now seen.

CXR ([**2-10**]): Right lower lobe opacification representing
aspiration or pneumonia. Unusual appearance of the left
shoulder. This could represent old trauma, correlate clinically.


Echo ([**2-11**]): The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. There is no
resting left ventricular outflow gradient; a mild gradient was
induced with Valsalva (cough). Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include mid to distal septal and apical
hypokinesis/akinesis.  Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
arch is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet
is eccentric. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and
may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
86F w/COPD p/w SOB found to have COPD exacerbation, RLL PNA but
and STEMI by ECG w/ST elev and +card [**Last Name (un) **].

# Pulm/ID: Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 51835**] on presentation was thought likely [**3-17**]
PNA and COPD exacerbation, along with failure [**3-17**] STEMI. On
admission, she had a low-grade F, WBC w/8 bands. She spiked to
102.8 on [**2-11**]. Two sets of BCx were + for coag negative
staph, but this cleared within 24 hours on levaquin;
surveillance cx were negative. Influenza nasal washings and
culture were negative. She received nebs, chest PT, and a
steroid taper-->60mg x3 days, 40mg x3days, 20mg x3days, then
off. She will being the 20mg x3 days dosing on discharge. She
received levaquin and flagyl for presumptive aspiration PNA and
should continue for a total 14 day course (on d/c day [**7-27**]). Of
note, CXR from [**2155-6-11**] showed similar RLL appearance and pt will
need repeat CXR to document clearance (had repeat CXR [**2155-2-13**],
stable). Otherwise, concern for malignancy. Of note, she had an
acute episode of dyspnea, which was concering for PE. Bilat
LENIs as well as chest CTA were negative for clots and PE,
respectively. The SOB was attributed to COPD and muscous
plugging. She responded well to chest PT. Also, her goal O2 sat
should remain 94-96% on supplementla O2.

# STEMI/CAD: Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] had ST elevations and elevated tropT & CK but
not MB. She had no anginal Sx. Because of her cerebral amyloid
angiopathy (CAA) all anticoagulatory agents were held and cath
was not offered. She was kept on beta-blockade and a statin. Her
cardiac enzymes continued to trend down. Echo showed her  EF to
be 40-45% 2+MR, 1+AR, [**2-15**]+ TR, Resting regional wall motion-->
mid to distal septal and apical hypo
