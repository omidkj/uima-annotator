Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80-year-old
gentleman with multiple medical problems including coronary
artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,
chronic renal insufficiency, hypercholesterolemia, anemia,
with a recent admission for congestive heart failure and new
onset atrial fibrillation, failed cardioversion times two,
and received biventricular pacemaker, and recently started on
Coumadin.  Since his last hospitalization the patient has
been feeling weak and has noticed black stools.

He was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
on this admission and transferred out to the floor on
[**2168-10-8**].  He [**Year (4 digits) **] any syncope, falls, bright red
blood per rectum, or a history of gastrointestinal problems
prior to this admission.  He said that he had been feeling
weak since he was discharged in [**2168-7-26**] and has noticed
several black stools on the days prior to admission.  He says
he uses aspirin once per day for cardiac protection, but he
[**Year (4 digits) **] any other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use.  He
[**Year (4 digits) **] any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.

He was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
from to the Emergency Department on [**2168-10-7**] after
he was noted to have a hematocrit of 22 (down from his
baseline of 30).  A nasogastric lavage in the Emergency
Department was negative, and he received vitamin K and fresh
frozen plasma and was sent to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  He received a total of two units of fresh frozen
plasma, vitamin K, and three units of packed red blood cells,
Protonix 40 mg twice per day and was seen by Gastrointestinal
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

He had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**10-8**] which
showed nodularity and petechiae in the esophagus, antral
erosions in the stomach; consistent with aspirin and
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug induced erosive
gastropathy.  Erosions in the distal bulb of the duodenum.
It was recommended that serum Helicobacter pylori serologies
be checked and a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy be done in
five to eight weeks.  His aspirin was discontinued.  Per
Gastrointestinal, it was felt appropriate to restart his
Coumadin in approximately three to four days after discharge
and to continue Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice per day
indefinitely.

There were no other problems in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, and his hematocrit rose after the transfusions, and he
was hemodynamically stable.  Therefore, it was felt
appropriate to transfer him out to the regular Medicine
Service.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed vital signs of a temperature of 97.8 degrees
Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 150/82, his heart rate was
79, his respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen saturation
was 99% on room air.  In general, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was alert and
oriented times three.  In no acute distress.  He was very
pleasant.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed no scleral icterus.  His pupils were equally round
and reactive to light.  His extraocular muscles were intact.
There was no conjunctival pallor.  His oropharynx revealed
the mucous membranes were moist.  There were no lesions or
exudates.  His cardiovascular examination revealed a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur heard best at left upper sternal
border.  His had normal first heart sounds and second heart
sounds.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  He had no
palpable hepatosplenomegaly.  He had a well-healed midline
scar.  Extremity examination revealed no evidence of
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  His pulses were 2+ and
symmetric.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on transfer revealed a complete blood count with a white
blood cell count of 7.7, his hematocrit was 28.6, his mean
cell volume was 90, and his platelets were 354.  His
prothrombin time was 14.7, and his INR was 1.4, and his
partial thromboplastin time was 28.7.  Chemistries revealed
his sodium was 138, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 105,
bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was 48, and his
creatinine was 2.4 (up from his baseline of 2).  He had
Helicobacter pylori serologies pending from his
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Of note, an echocardiogram in
[**2168-7-26**] revealed an ejection fraction of less than 25%,
left atrial mild dilation, 1+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral
regurgitation, and severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.

His esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2168-10-8**] revealed
no blood in the stomach, small prepyloric benign ulcerations
with no evidence of active bleeding, small duodenal
ulcerations, and mild diffuse gastritis.  In the middle third
of the esophagus was noted patchy nodularity and petechiae of
the mucosa with a stigmata of recent bleeding.  This was also
noted in the lower third of the esophagus.  It was remarked
that this was likely due to his nasogastric tube but should
be re-evaluated with a repeat endoscopy in five to eight
weeks.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  While on
the Medicine Service.

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  Given his history of upper
gastrointestinal bleed and admission to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, the patient was followed by the Gastrointestinal
Service when he came out to the floor.  He was
hemodynamically stable the whole time, and his stools
remained occult-blood positive.  This was felt likely to be
secondary to continued passage of the blood that he had bled
before.  There seemed to be no other signs of rebleeding.

He was continued on his Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice per
day.  His aspirin was discontinued, and he was advised that
he was never to take aspirin again.  His hematocrit and
coagulations were followed when he came to the floor, and his
hematocrit remained stable in the 28 to 30 range until the
day of discharge.  It was felt safe to discharge him home on
[**2168-10-9**].  He had a repeat endoscopy scheduled with
Gastroenterology prior to discharge.

As an outpatient, the patient was never to use nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs or aspirin again.  He was to be
continued on his Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice per day, and
he was to have a repeat endoscopy in five to eight weeks; as
scheduled per Gastroenterology.  He was allowed to restart
his Coumadin on the Tuesday after discharge.
