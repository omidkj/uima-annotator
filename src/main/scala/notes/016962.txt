Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26453**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-1-11**] for elective
surgical management of his aortic valve and coronary artery
disease. He was taken directly to the operating room where he
underwent an aortic valve replacement and two vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting. Postoperatively he was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He developed atrial fibrillation for which amiodarone
was started. On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. He was diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. He developed a left forearm intravenous
infiltrate which was treated with warm compress, elevation and
keflex with improvement. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He was ready for discharge to rehab on POD #6.
