Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status; transfer from MICU

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation; now s/p extubation

History of Present Illness:
71M with multiple myeloma currently on Velcade, mixed
obstructive-restrictive lung disease, PAF, presented to the ED
on [**2167-8-29**] complaining of polyuria.  Per sister, patient has
been fatigued with poor po intake for several weeks. She is not
aware of any acute changes in his health. She took him to his
Velcade appointment on Friday, where he felt fatigued but was of
normal mood and behavior.  He received day 4 of his Velcade at
this time as well as 1u PRBCs.
.
His VS on presentation to the ED were T 99.6, HR 68, BP 106/56,
RR 25, O2sat 97% RA.  His K was 6.0, so he was given Kayexalate
30g. On exam, he had RUQ tenderness with a normal RUQ
ultrasound. He was also noted to be somewhat dyspneic with an
elevated D-dimer so he was sent for a V/Q scan to rule out a PE.
.
Halfway through the scan, he became agitated and combative and
had stool incontinence.  His VS upon return were HR 110, BP
144/65, O2sat 89% NRB. He was dyspneic, diaphoretic, and
nonverbal. He was given Ativan 1mg IV for agitation. On lung
exam, he had very poor air movement. He was intubated in the ED
for airway protection with altered mental status and hypoxic
respiratory failure. CXR showed clear lungs. He was given
Solumedrol 125mg IV, Benadryl 50mg IV, and Pepcid 20mg IV to
treat possible allergic reaction to the radionuclide material.
He was also started on a propofol gtt for sedation and 2L NS. He
was admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
In the MICU, he was quickly weaned off of the ventilator and on
to a nasal cannula at 2L/min on the morning of [**2167-8-31**].  His
mental status remained somewhat impaired in that he was never
fully oriented to place.  He had 2 sets of blood cultures sent
(though it's unclear if he was ever febrile) and grew gram(+)
cocci in pairs/clusters from 3/4 bottles; he was started on
vancomycin.  His sputum culture also had 4+ gram(+) cocci in
pairs/chains.  His warfarin was initially held due to the
possibility of an LP but this was never done since his mental
status seemed to be improving.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**12/2164**] after presenting with
several months of diffuse bony pain; found to have numerous
lytic bony lesions and a monocloncal kappa protein in his UPEP
(>8 grams of kappa proteinuria); diagnosed with stage IIIB kappa
light chain multiple myeloma.  He initially responded well to
Decadron and was then intolerant to thalidomide/Decadron; he
subsequently responded well to Cytoxan/Decadron with a marked
decrease in his kappa excretion and improvement inhis renal
function.  In [**7-/2165**], he underwent an autologous SCT after
treatment with high-dose melphalan.  He went into remission at
this time which he maintained until [**7-/2167**] when he presented to
the ED with dyspnea on exertion; he was found to have 20 grams
of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria and new diabetes insipidus.  A bone
marrow biopsy showed >60% plasma cells.  He was pulsed with
Decadron and discharged on po Decadron for his MM and intranasal
ddAVP for his DI.  On [**2167-8-25**], he was started on Velcade (in
addition to his [**Hospital1 **] Decadron).  He received days 1 and 4 of
Velcade prior to this presentation.

diagnosed in [**12-27**]. Extensive lytic bone lesions (mostly in
pelvis and legs) without renal involvement. s/p autologous stem

cell transplantation in [**7-27**]. Was in remission with Zometa
qo month until [**8-18**] when he had a marrow biopsy showing relapse.

[**First Name (STitle) 1557**]. Baseline creatinine 1.9-2.0.
2. Diabetes insipidus- dx during [**7-29**] hosp., + water deprivation
test and response to ddAVP (thus, likely central)
