Service:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 17988**] is a 68-year-old caucasian female with history of
non-small, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post CHOP treatment
approximately two weeks prior to admission  The patient
presented to the emergency department with complaints of two
days of intermittent fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea.  She
subsequently developed respiratory distress.  She was
emergently intubated for presumed pulmonary edema as seen on
a chest x-ray.  Following the intubation she had a PEA arrest
and was given a total of 3 mg of Epinephrine and 3 mg of
Atropine before regaining a pulse.  The total time of pulse
was approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  She then required
pressors for hypotension which were subsequently weaned
done in the Emergency Room which showed new globally
depressed left ventricular function.  The patient
subsequently ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a CK
of 623 and an MB of 123.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes congestive heart failure and
history of non-Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2179-6-11**].
Diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age 30 with neuropathy,
nephropathy, retinopathy.  Diffuse large cell lymphoma
treated at [**Hospital1 69**] status post
two cycles of chemotherapy with CHOP/Retuxen with Neupogen
and Procrit.  Hypertension, obesity, renal insufficiency with
a history of acute renal failure secondary to interstitial
nephritis, hemorrhoids, arthritis, history of vaginal
bleeding, negative vaginal ultrasound.  Status post
appendectomy, status post third toe amputation.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Premarin
2.  Amlodipine.
3.  NPH insulin.
4.  Multivitamins.
5.  Folate.
6.  Allopurinol.
7.  Lopressor.
8.  Zestril.
9.  B12.
10. B6.
11. Neupogen.
12. Epogen.
13. Effexor.
ALLERGIES:  Vioxx, Celebrex.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission showed temperature of
100.5, pulse 178, blood pressure 94/70.  Respiratory rat 25.
In general the patient was obese, intubated, sedated.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils were equal and reactive
5 mm to 4 mm.  Gaze was upward and slightly to the right.
Neck was obese, unable to assess JVP.  Cardiovascular exam:
Tachycardiac, unable to hear rales.  Pulmonary exam showed
rare diffuse wheezing.  Upper airway sounds, otherwise clear.
Abdominal exam had positive bowel sounds, obese, nontender.
Genitourinary exam shows a massively prolapsed uterus.
Extremities showed 1+ edema and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Neurological examination the patient moved all four
extremities, withdrew to pain and had intact gag reflex.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  Patient had a white count of 11.4,
hemoglobin 10.6, hematocrit 32.1, platelet count 477.  A Chem
7 of 139, 3.6, 102, 23, 17, 1.2, 175.  Urinalysis showed
greater than 50 white cells and many bacteria.

Chest x-ray findings were consistent with flash pulmonary
edema with right base atelectasis verses pneumonia.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 119.
Slightly irregular, normal axis and intervals.  1/[**Street Address(2) 1766**]
depression in the lateral leads, poor R-wave progression.  A
repeat electrocardiogram showed rate of 183 and [**Street Address(2) 17989**]
depression in the lateral leads and in lead 2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Neurological:  A neurology consult was done on [**2179-7-6**] to
assess for anoxic brain injury.  On exam at that point the
patient was intubated, unresponsive to sternal rub and had no
spontaneous movements.  Her pupils were equal and reactive to
light and deviated up to the left with conjugate gaze.
Oculocephalic reflex and corneal reflex were intact.  There
was no blink to threat.  There were fine repetitive eye
movements.  The neurology service recommended an EEG to rule
out status epilepticus, a Head CT and the avoidance of
sedative medications.  Head CT was performed on [**2179-8-5**] which
showed no acute process.  EEG was performed on [**2179-8-6**] which
showed background rhythm of very low voltage, no definite
cortical activity was discernible.  Frequent bursts of
generalized Delta slowing and widespread severe
encephalopathy effecting both cortical and sub-cortical
structures.  On the recommendation of the neurology service
the head CT was repeated on [**2179-8-9**].  This again showed no
bleed, no mass effect or midline shift, only mild atrophy.
On physical examination the patient made no neurologic
improvement throughout the admission.  She continued to be
unresponsive to painful stimuli or to voice.  Continued to
[**Doctor Last Name **] any spontaneous movement and maintained normal brain
stem function.

Respiratory:  The patient was intubated in the emergency
department on [**2179-8-5**] for respiratory failure secondary to
flash pulmonary edema.  Her respiratory status gradually
improved throughout the hospital course.  She required
decreasing ventilatory support.  The tracheostomy was placed
on [**2179-8-12**] for long-term ventilatory access.  By discharge the
patient had been weaned to a pressure support mode at a level
of 12.

Infectious Disease:  Due to fevers and an infiltrate seen on
chest x-ray on admission the patient was started on
Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime on [**2179-8-5**].  On
[**2179-8-6**] the Ciprofloxacin was changed to Levofloxacin.  These
medications were selected to apparently cover for presumed
pneumonia.  Pan cultures were performed.  The only positive
results of these cultures was urinary tract infection with E.
coli.  Vancomycin and Ceftazidime were continued until [**2179-8-12**]
and the Levofloxacin was continued until [**2179-8-14**].  Throughout
treatment with antibiosis, the patient continued to
intermittently spike fevers and repeat cultures were
performed on [**2179-8-16**].  Urine cultures were positive for yeast
greater than 100,000.  In light of the continued fevers and
this focus of infection, the patient was started on Diflucan
on [**2179-8-16**].

Cardiology:  The patient suffered an acute myocardial
infarction at the time of admission with subsequently,
markedly suppressed left ventricular function.  She was
placed on pressors for one day and then successfully weaned
off.  A follow-up echocardiogram done on [**8-9**] to shows
ejection fraction of less than 25%, global left ventricular
hypokinesis and 3+ mitral regurg due to the patient's severe
neurologic condition.  No further cardiac workup was
performed and no interventions were pursued.

By [**2179-8-11**] it became apparent the patient's neurologic status
was unlikely to improve and that she had suffered a severe
anoxic brain injury.  At this time the patient's family
met with the MICU team to discuss further management in light
of the patient's overall prognosis. The patient's family clearly
understands the poor prognosis and the very limited possibility
for recovery. They wish however to continue with supportive care
for this patient at least for a limited amount of time.

Therefore, the a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and a
PICC line were placed on [**2179-8-11**], and a tracheostomy was placed on
[**2179-8-12**] in order to prepare the patient to discharge at an
outside long-term care facility.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  This patient's neurologic status is
very poor and chance for significant recovery is very slim.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Severe anoxic brain injury secondary to 10 to 15 minute
    PEA, cardiac arrest.
2.  Acute myocardial infarction with subsequent suppressed
    left ventricular function.
3.  Respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
4.  Yeast urinary infection.
