History of Present Illness:
58 M c quadriplegia [**2-23**] C4/C5 fracture [**2130**] and vent dependent c
PEG tube [**2-23**] massive thalamic bleed in [**2133**] who presents for
evaluation of clogged G tube. Noted on Saturday to have sluggish
passage of feeds through G tube.  This morning, noted to have no
passage through G tube and sent to [**Hospital1 18**].  On discussion with RN
at rehab facility, pt c no obvious grimacing to abdominal
palpation, no aberrations of vital signs.  Of note was recently
started on cefepime --> transitioned to zosyn for elevated WBC
and + sputum ctx. Also of note, recently had suprapubic catheter
replaced and has had intermittent leakage of urine via penis
over last several days.
.
In ED, VS - 98.0, 62, 108/64, 100% RA, rectal exam performed but
stool not felt and unable to be disimpacted.  CT abdomen showed
multiple abdominal wall abscesses, no evidence for obstruction.
Recevied vancomycin, ceftazidime, and blood cultures drawn. Had
episode of bradycardia to 30 in ED for which pt. received
atropine once with rise in HR to 90s
.
Currently pt minimally responsive as his baseline per rehab
staff.  Cannot answer questions re: pain, discomfort.


Past Medical History:
1. Recent hospitalization for sepsis at [**Hospital1 18**] thought [**2-23**] ESBL
Klebsiella osteomyelitis of L ischium vs. decubiti ulcers
2. Candidal fungemia [**8-26**] at [**Hospital1 2177**] tx c imipenem, vanc, caspo.
3. Quadriplegia s/p C4/C5 fracture [**2-23**] MVA [**2130**]
4. Thalamic hemorrhage [**2133**]
5. Diabetes


Social History:
lives at rehab, unclear [**Name2 (NI) **]/ETOH history


Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
GEN- middle aged man lying supine, arms in flexed position.
VS- 96.1, 108, 208/122, 14, 100% RA
HEENT- Op clear, MMM.  Moves eyes spontaneously
LUNGS- Coarse rhonchi diffusely. No wheeze
HEART- RRR, S1, S2, no murmur
ABDOM- G tube in place. + Erythema around site of G tube entry.
Abdomen distended mildly but not tender.  Hypoactive BS.
EXTRE- wwp, no edema; denuded and atrophic muscles over legs,
clubbing
NEURO- quadriplegic. Occasional will respond to commands such as
closing eyes, showing teeth.


Pertinent Results:
CT abdomen:
1. Extensive fecal material extending from the rectum throughout
the entire colon with rectal wall thickening and likely edema in
association with fecal impaction. These findings raise the
question of stercoral colitis.
2. Probable osteomyelitis of the left ischium and ilium
secondary to a large left sacral decubitus ulcer.
3. No evidence for small bowel obstruction, however, there is
fecalization of small bowel which suggests a functional
obstruction.
4. Multiple anterior abdominal wall abscesses as described
above. Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
5. Gastrostomy tube, IVC filter, and suprapubic catheter
identified.

Port a cath placement:
TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: After informed consent was obtained, the
patient's left upper chest was prepped and draped in a sterile
fashion. Lidocaine with Epinephrine was used to anesthetize the
skin, tract and eventual location of this patient's port. The
subclavian vein was entered with a microcatheter system after
which a tract was made and a port reservoir created within the
subcutaneous tissue. The port was then sutured in place using a
zero-silk suture. The catheter was then measured so the eventual
length would place it in the distal SVC. The vascular entrance
site was then dilated to 9 French after which a peel-away sheath
was placed and the catheter advanced. The catheter was then
joined to the subcutaneous port without incident.

Final chest x-ray demonstrates no kinks in the catheter,
catheter tip in the distal SVC. The catheter was accessed within
the angiography Suite to ensure appropriate infusion and
aspiration. It was then flushed with heparinized saline.

Throughout the procedure, the tract and subcutaneous port
location were irrigated with orthopedic solution.

The overlying skin was closed with a running 2-0 Vicryl suture
(absorbable and no need to remove).

IMPRESSION: Placement of an 8 French subcutaneous port via the
left subclavian vein with the tip in the right atrium. No
complications. The catheter is ready for use.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was [**Hospital 70882**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] only to have his G tube
replaced by IR as it had become clogged.  Given that he was
chronically vented, he was admitted to the ICU.

His G tube was replaced successfully by IR.  There was
difficulty obtaining consent.  If he is transferred from your
facility again, please document who to contact for consent, and
correct phone numbers for this person.

In anticipation of fixing the clogged G tube, he had a CT scan
in the emergency room which showed mutiple fluid filled pockets
in the abdominal wall.  One of these pockets was aspirated and
showed only clotted blood.  It was felt that these were most
likely due to his heparin injections and so heparin sc was
discontinued.

In the emergency room, upon seeing the abdominal wall pockets of
fluid, the emergency room staff were concerned that these could
be abscesses.  Blood cultures were obtained and 2 out of 4
bottles grew gram negative rods.  He was initially treated with
Zosyn, but once the culture demonstrated that it was unlikely to
be pseudomonas, and the resistance pattern was consistent with
an ESBL resistant Klebsiella, Pt was switched to Meropenem.
Meropenem was started on [**5-7**] for a 10 day course.  Last day of
Meropenem is [**2148-5-16**].  it was presumed that his PICC line was
the source.  This was removed and a port-a cath was placed by
IR.

Pt has a history of autonomic dysregulation, this was treated by
continuing his regimen of metoprolol.

Of note, pt was maximally impacted and constipated on arrival,
he required an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 70883**] [**Last Name (un) 49666**] regimen.
