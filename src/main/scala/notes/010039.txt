Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute alcohol intoxication/liver failure/bleeding gastric
varices.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Trans-jugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS).
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
Bronchoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
45M with history of alcoholism presented to OSH with hematemesis
and now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for actively bleeding gastric
varices.
.
The patient was in his USOH until the night prior to admission,
when after drinking approximately a pint of hard liquor, his
wife found him "about to pass out" and she lowered him onto the
bed.  His eyes subsequently rolled back and she called 911, but
patient refused transport. EMTs were called once this happened
again.  The wife was later contact[**Name (NI) **] by the police who were
contact[**Name (NI) **] by someone who witnessed the patient pull to the side
of the road in his truck and discard his clothing, which were
soaked in blood.  The patien later admitted to vomiting a
"bucket-full" of blood on his clothes in his truck.
.
At OSH, pt vomited 1800cc of blood. BP 87/54, HR 139. His hct
was 28 and his INR 2.3 and he received 2U PRBC and 2U FFP. He
was started on octreotide and levofloxacin and underwent an EGD
which showed 4cm gastric fundic varices with active bleeding.
Stomach was full of old and new blood.  No noted esophageal
bleeding lesions.  Nothing was treated endoscopically and the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for octreotide and for TIPS
procedure.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to be tachycardic in 120s-140s with BP
120/80 and hct 32.1.  He was given 10mg IV Valium x 3, banana
bag, calcium gluconate 2g, Octreotide 50mcg/hr and pantoprazole
40mg IV x 1. Denies N/V, abdominal pain, CP, SOB. Reports
tremulousness.  He had an NG lavage which showed dark red blood
which did not clear with 500cc. He was given 2U FFP in the ED.

Past Medical History:
1. Alcohol abuse, drinks 1 pint/day, last sobriety ~2 yrs ago,
no hx of withdrawl sz, previously admitted 2 yrs ago for detox
2. Anxiety
3. Depression
4. Admitted [**5-31**] for "dehydration", wife thought he was "yellow"

.
CXR [**2133-11-10**]: 1. Confluent airspace opacities within the right
and left lower lung zones, suggestive of multifocal pneumonia or
aspiration.
2. Right IJ catheter is seen, with a kink in the proximal most
portion.
.
TIPS [**2133-11-10**]: 1) Portal hypertension with pressure gradient
between the portal vein and hepatic vein measured 14 mmHg prior
to formation of the portosystemic shunt. Large gastric varices
were demonstrated. 2) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt placement and alcohol embolization of two large gastric
varices with good angiographic results was performed. The
post-TIPS portosystemic pressure gradient was reduced to 9 mmHg.
3) Placement of a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous
catheter via the right internal jugular vein with the tip in the
SVC, ready for use.
.
ECG [**2133-11-10**]: Sinus tachycardia; Modest diffuse nonspecific ST-T
wave changes.
.
CXR [**2133-11-11**]: Increased opacification at the left lung base
likely represents worsening pneumonia or aspiration. Improved
aeration of the right lung base probably represents improving
atelectasis.
.
RUQ u/s [**2133-11-11**]: The left portal vein is not visualized. There
is hepatopetal flow within the main portal vein with velocities
of approximately 15 cm/sec. The TIPS is poorly visualized. There
appears to be wall-to-wall flow velocities of approximately 37,
60, and 76 cm/sec returned from the proximal, mid, and distal
TIPS respectively. The IVC is patent. There is no evidence of
intra or perihepatic hematoma.
.
CT head [**2133-11-12**]: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal
extra-axial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift. The
ventricles and basal cisterns are unremarkable. The slightly
lower attenuation of the left temporal lobe is thought to be
artifactual given the slightly asymmetric positioning of the
patient's head. There is no definite focal effacement in this
area. Fluid in the ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses is
probably secondary to endotracheal intubation.
.
CXR [**2133-11-12**]: Heterogeneous opacification at the right lung
base, which cleared between [**11-10**] and 16, has recurred.
Although I cannot exclude pneumonia, the sequence of events more
likely reflects asymmetric edema accompanied by small bilateral
pleural effusions. Left lower lobe atelectasis persists. The
heart is normal size. There is no pneumothorax. Tip of
endotracheal tube at the thoracic inlet is more than 8 cm from
the carina, 4 cm above optimal placement. Tip of the right
jugular sheath projects over the SVC. No pneumothorax or
mediastinal widening.
.
ECG [**2133-11-12**]: Sinus rhythm. Non-diagnostic repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-11-10**]
heart rate is slower. Otherwise, no major change.
.
CXR [**2133-11-13**]: Consolidation in the lungs, particularly the left
has increased substantially since [**10-11**], having improved
between 15 and 16. Some of this may be due to pulmonary edema
but worsening pneumonia, particularly in the left lung is
presumed. Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin
of the clavicles, more than 8 cm from the carina and 4 cm above
optimal placement. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and
out of view. Right internal jugular sheath projects over the
expected course of the right internal jugular vein, but is
sharply folded proximally. There is at least a small left
pleural effusion. The heart is top normal size and unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
.
