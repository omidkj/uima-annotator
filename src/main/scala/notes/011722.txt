CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Decreased hematocrit/recurrent
gastrointestinal bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 77-year-old
female who was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 649**] to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital after undergoing a small
bowel resection and right colectomy for a gastrointestinal
bleed that was secondary to an arteriovenous malformation.
This operation was performed on [**2182-6-12**]. Her postoperative
course was remarkable for an extended ileus, as well as a
methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which
was being treated with TPN and vancomycin. She had been
otherwise doing well at the [**Hospital 8641**] rehabilitation facility,
when she developed abdominal pain and distention, as well as
dark, bloody stools. A CBC was obtained at [**Location (un) 8641**] and this
revealed a hematocrit of 17 and a white blood cell count of
21,000. She was transfused two units of packed red blood
cells and taken by Med Flight from [**Location (un) 8641**] to [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further intensive care.

The patient reported for the past few days to have blood per
rectum, with reported abdominal distention and lower
abdominal pain. She had intermittent nausea with loose stools
but no vomiting. Upon presentation to the Emergency
Department at [**Hospital6 256**], she was
not in any respiratory distress, but she was in mild hypoxia
with continuous lower abdominal pain. She was admitted for
further evaluation of her drop in hematocrit.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, CBC with a white blood cell
count of 21.6, hematocrit 21.8, platelets 197. Chemistries:
Sodium 131, potassium 3.9, chloride 90, bicarbonate 33, BUN
37, creatinine 1.2, glucose 92. Urinalysis was essentially
negative.

Liver function tests:  ALT 15, AST 23, alkaline phosphatase
64, amylase 19, total bilirubin 0.7. Coagulation studies:
INR 1.2, PTT 29.8.

Chest x-ray is unchanged from the study of [**2182-6-29**], with
right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis versus
consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2182-7-2**] to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit. She received five units of
packed red blood cells over the first night. She was made NPO
and given intravenous fluids as well. A post transfusion
hematocrit was 30. On [**2182-7-3**], the patient underwent an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed by the Gastrointestinal
service. There was no blood seen in the stomach, but there
were erosions in the stomach and duodenum which were
consistent with gastritis. It did not explain the patient's
dark, bloody stools, and it was recommended that the patient
receive a colonoscopy the following day. The patient was
properly bowel prepped for a colonoscopy, which was performed
on [**2182-7-4**]. This demonstrated friability and granularity
in the terminal ileum, as well as at the surgical
anastomosis. It was believed that this was the source of the
maroon colored stools. The bleeding was stopped and The
patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient's
hematocrit now remained stable at 34. Throughout the rest of
her hospital course, the patient's gastrointestinal issues
remained stable and the patient did not have any further
bleeding issues.

In terms of the patient's pulmonary status, the patient was
currently being treated with vancomycin for her methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia that was diagnosed
on previous hospitalization. Due to her elevated white blood
cell count, the patient was started on wide spectrum
antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl to
cover for any possible sites that were not visualized on CT
scan. The patient finished a seven day course of vancomycin,
as well as a seven day course of levofloxacin. Her Flagyl was
ultimately discontinued as there was no suspicion for
abscess, and her white blood cell count eventually declined
for several days. It was also thought that her hypoxia was
secondary to her methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia, as well as her underlying chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Due to sputum cultures that were obtained
demonstrating methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia during this hospitalization, the patient's
vancomycin was restarted on [**2182-7-13**] for a total vancomycin
course of [**11-28**] days. Her levofloxacin was discontinued on
[**2182-7-17**] after a total of seven days.

During her Intensive Care Unit course, the patient also
developed increasing lower extremity edema. A Cardiology
consult was obtained. They recommended obtaining an
echocardiogram, which demonstrated overall normal systolic
function with an ejection fraction of greater than 55
percent, with moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. They felt that the patient should be diuresed,
and the patient was started on ethacrynic acid since the
patient was allergic to Lasix. Diuresis of the patient also
improved her oxygenation.

In terms of her nutrition, the patient was admitted with TPN
and this was continued throughout her hospital course. Her
TPN was decreased as appropriate as the patient began taking
more by mouth. By discharge date, the patient was tolerating
a regular diabetic and cardiac diet. The patient remained
fluid overloaded throughout her hospital course, but became
intravascularly dry due to excessive diuresis. On the day
before discharge, the patient was given a normal saline bolus
to help offset an elevated bicarbonate and slightly elevated
creatinine. The patient did not respond to this bolus well,
and the patient became slightly hypoxic during the bolus. The
patient's O2 requirements were increased intermittently, and
was eventually weaned down to her baseline within several
hours of this desaturation episode. The patient's O2
saturations remained stable for the rest of her hospital
course. The patient was successfully transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit on [**2182-7-15**]. Calorie counts were
obtained while the patient was on the floor, and the
nutritionist recommended that the TPN be discontinued as the
patient's p.o. intake had become sufficient.

The patient remained slightly distended in the last few days
of her hospitalization at [**Hospital6 2018**]. The patient was given a rectal tube, Dulcolax
suppository, and manual disimpaction with moderate success. A
Gastrografin enema study was also performed to ensure that
there were no problems with the anastomosis site which would
result in her abdominal distention, but this proved to be
within normal limits.

The care of Ms. [**Known lastname 52593**] was discussed with her pri
