Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia and hypotension s/p cath, SOB at initial
presentation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
 72-year-old male w/ hx of HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD s/p q-wave IMI
and CABG in 01 (LIMA --> LAD, SVG --> OM, SVG --> distal RCA)
and s/p Cypher DES to the right posterior lateral branch in '[**63**]
presented to CMI service last night for outpt cath after having
dyspnea on exertion and mild ST depressions in aVR during
recovery during stress test. At cath today became hypotensive to
70s and bradycardic when inserting catheter into the groin. Was
given atropine x 2 and placed on dopamine drip during the
procedure. After procedure the dopamine drip was weaned off and
pt again become hypotensive, another atropine amp was given
without good effect, therefore dopamine drip was restarted at
20, and pt transferred to the floor. At cath had no obstructive
disease in SVGs nor LIMA. CI was 2.7.
Prior to coming to the floor had CT scan of abdomen that was
negative for an RP bleed. CT scan did however reveal subtantial
scarring, interstitial disease, ?glass-ground appearance at the
base of the lungs although there were only a couple of cuts of
the lower lung included on the film. On review of the medical
chart there is a pre-op CXR in '[**59**] with "bilateral hazy and
reticular opacity in the mid and lower lung zones" but did not
have further work-up at that time. Of note, pt was started on
lasix 2 days ago since his cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] though he
might have fluids in his lungs and wanted to give it a try but
pt does not have a dx of CHF. No other changes in meds. In
addition to poosibly being dehydrated from lasix, pt has over
the past few days pt has been spending a lot of time in the sun
and was NPO after MN for the procedure today.
.
Regarding the initial presentation, pt has had increasing
shortness of breath over the past month. Several weeks ago had
an URI with nasal secretions, was prescribed Advair by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] rhinitis improved but the shortness of breath did not. He
reports currently developing dyspnea with any exertion such as a
flight of stairs, inclines or heavy lifting. He initailly stated
he has never been short of breath prior to a month ago, but when
pressed further states he has had occasional episodes for which
he appararently had PFTs [**2-16**] yrs ago (records are not
available). He denies any hx of joint pains or ahces, rashes,
blood in urine, fevers. His profession was running cranes in
[**Location (un) 86**] and worked as an apple farmer as well. 9 years ago
developed neuropathy and during the work-up had a spinal which
revealed high levels of mercury, lead and other metals per wife.

Stress test on [**2165-11-4**], where he was able to exercise 3 minutes
on a standard [**Doctor First Name **] protocol stopping due to fatigue and dyspnea
achieving a peak heart rate of 122 bpm. He had 0.5-0.[**Street Address(2) 35782**]
depressions in aVR during recovery. Frequent PVC??????s, bigeminy,
couplets, pairs and APB??????s were noted.
.
When seen on the floor the dopamine had been weaned to 4. Pt had
an echo with normal EF (actually >65%) and no sign of tamponade.
Pt stated he had no CP, sob, palp, but was complaining of severe
leg cramps that he has from time to time but usually not this
bad. Pt was given 2mg of morphine for the leg pain and 500cc
bolus of NS with systolic pressures staying in 80s although pt
was completely asymptomatic and with UOP 260cc's over 2-3hrs
after arriving to CCU. EKG without change, enzymes negative at
cath. Dopamine drip was stopped and pt was given another 250cc's
of NS.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the CCU for further work-up and treatment of
his hypotension and bradycardia.  The impression of the CCU team
was that this was most consistent with a vagal response in the
setting of likely dehydration from recent lasix therapy, sun
exposure and NPO status for cath. Pt was completely asymptomatic
aside form leg cramps [**2-15**] dehydration.  The sheath in the groin
was removed quickly, then pt was given a fluid bolus of 750cc
with reolution of hypotension and bradycardia, then weaned off
the dopamine drip.  Maitainance fluids were kept overnight.
Also had nl echo, EKG unchanged, negative troponins to tamponade
and ROMI.   Tele overnight wihtout any events.  Beta blocker was
held overnight and then restarted on dischareg after resolution
of bradycardia and hypotension.
The cath that was done for dyspnea on exertion and mild ST
changes in single lead during recovery did not reveal any
lesions.  The CCU team felt likely dyspnea was related to the
pulmonary process including substantial scarring seen on cuts of
CT abd and bilateral hazy and reticular opacity in the mid and
lower lung zones seen on CXR in '[**59**]; likely an ILD.  The team
agreed pt need w/u for this including high-resolution CT chest,
PFT's and labs including [**Doctor First Name **], ACE, ANCA, RF, anti-GBM, HIV (+/-
BAL and/or biopsy if w/u inconclusive).  The pt and his HCP
(wife) declined any work-up in hospital and wanted to have care
at [**Hospital3 7569**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The
discharge summary was sent to PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was sent out on home
