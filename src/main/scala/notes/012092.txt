HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old female
with type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent, history of Graves'
disease, hyperthyroidism, asthma, hepatitis C, obesity,
inflammatory arthritis, migraines, and a questionable history
of inflammatory bowel disease who presents to the Emergency
Department [**2128-9-23**] from the [**Hospital **] Clinic with blood

control when it was noticed that she was found to be
profoundly hyperglycemic.  Patient reports feeling terrible
for one week, tired, polyuria, polydipsia, feeling
dehydrated, nauseated, weak, with blurry vision.

worsens on inspiration, lasts a few seconds, comes and goes.
Patient reports having this type of chest pain in the past,
and she seen those from her gastroesophageal reflux disease
type symptoms that she complains of repeatedly.

jugular venous distention.  Neck is supple.  Thyroid is not
palpable.  Carotids 2+.  No bruits.  Heart rate is regular
rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  She refused most of the
abdominal exam.  She has normoactive bowel sounds.  Soft,
obese, nondistended, diffusely tender to palpation.  No

dorsalis pedis, popliteal.  Neuro exam:  Alert and oriented
times three, 5/5 strength bilaterally, 2+ deep tendon
reflexes, no focal signs or deficits notable.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count was 5.5,
hematocrit 43.5, platelets 313.  Urinalysis was notable for a
specific gravity of 1.[**Telephone/Fax (1) 102651**] glucose, trace blood,
negative for urinary tract infection.  Chem-7 134, 4.0, 125,
15, 1.2.  Blood sugar is 369, which reportedly is down from
842 and 792 at the [**Hospital **] Clinic.  Anion gap was 9.  CK was
42.  Troponin was less than 0.01.  TSH, T3, T4 were pending.

Chest x-ray was read as normal.

EKG showed no acute changes associated with ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 49-year-old woman with type 2
diabetes, insulin dependent, with severe insulin resistance
and also a reported history of insulin antibodies questioning
diagnosis type 1 versus type 2 diabetes, history of
hyperthyroidism, hypertension, asthma, and marked obesity,
and gastroesophageal reflux disease, who presented to the
Emergency Department and was treated initially for
hyperglycemic with blood sugars reported to be greater than
800.

1.  Hyperglycemia:  Patient had reported blood sugars as high
as 842.  She did not have an anion gap and no evidence of
diabetic ketoacidosis.  She was not ketotic.  However, given
the questionable diagnosis of type 1 versus type 2 diabetes
and severe hyperglycemia, she was treated with aggressive
fluid rehydration.  She was given multiple liters of normal
saline and initially started on insulin drip to better
regulate her blood sugars.  She was continued on the drip to
the morning and to the next night, adjusting her intravenous
fluids appropriately then hyperglycemia.  By the morning of
[**2128-9-24**] the insulin drip was discontinued and the patient
was restarted on her home insulin regimen with continued
close monitoring of her blood sugar.

2.  Hypotension:  Over the course of the first 24 hours of
her hospital stay, the patient became profoundly hypotensive
on the floor on [**2128-9-24**] and was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure and hemodynamic
management.  It was ultimately determined that the patient
was extremely hypovolemic secondary to an osmotic diuresis
that had gone on for multiple days.

She was given three liters of intravenous fluids on the floor
with minimal blood pressure response.  That is why she was
transferred to the Unit for closer hemodynamic monitoring,
where she was given additional liters of intravenous fluid
with normalization of her blood pressure.

With her blood pressure stabilized she was transferred back
from the Intensive Care Unit on [**2128-9-25**] to the floor for
continued management of her oscillating hyper and
hypoglycemia.

3.  Hyperglycemia:  This is a patient who presents with
repeated history of hyperglycemia complicated by a failure to
adequately control her blood sugars.  She reports baseline
sugars in the 200 to 400s at home and subsequently presented
to the [**Hospital **] Clinic following extremely high treatment with
NPH at 80 and 70 q. a.m. and q p.m.  However, during her
hospital stay she had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia, and
her insulin requirement was titrated down accordingly.

In consult with the Endocrine fellow and the input of [**Last Name (un) **]
attendings, she was discharged on an insulin regimen of 50 of
NPH in the morning and 54 NPH at night with an adjusted
sliding scale.  There certainly is concern that this will be
inadequate once the patient returns home and resumes her
normal diet.  However, in house with decreased caloric
consumption and closer blood sugar monitoring, this seemed to
adequately control the patient's blood sugar.  She will be
followed up closely in the [**Hospital **] Clinic over the next week
to titrate her insulin requirements accordingly.

4.  Rule out myocardial infarction:  The patient was
ultimately ruled out for an myocardial infarction per enzymes
and EKG.

5.  Hyperthyroidism:  The patient was diagnosed with Graves'
disease and hyperthyroidism.  During her inpatient stay her
hyperthyroidism was not treated aggressively, and she has
subsequently been scheduled for outpatient follow up with an
uptake study and possible ablation if this is determined
necessary.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.
