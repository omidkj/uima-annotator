History of Present Illness:
84 year-old male with history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2186**], VT with
ICD in [**2186**], systolic dysfunction with EF 30% who is transferred
from OSH for recurrent VT.  He was brought in to OSH by EMS
[**11-12**] after repeated runs of VT with ICD discharges.  He had an
ICD placed in [**2186**] for history of VT and had been stable on
sotalol.  However, in late [**Month (only) 216**] his ICD fired, with resultant
increase in sotalol dose.  On [**2195-11-9**] he had another episode of
310 ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]; he was switched to amiodarone.  When he woke up
yesterday morning, he had multiple shocks and fell, due to
partial unresponsiveness.  EMS started lidocaine gtt at 2 mg/min
after a 100 mg bolus.  Interrogation of his device in the OSH ED
suggests 25-27 discharges.  His primary cardiologist switched
him to amiodarone gtt with 300 mg bolus.  He was admitted to
their ICU.
.
Yesterday, at 5 pm, the patient's amiodarone gtt was weaned with
recurrent VT and ICD fired additional 9 times.  Patient was
awake and alert.  Amiodarone bolus of 150 mg given.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for EP eval.
.
Of note, per the patient he had an episode of emesis yesterday,
which his daughters report appeared to be coffee-grounds.  He
has had no further episodes.  He denies abdominal pain, black
stools, or red stools.  His last BM was yesterday.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any cough, or hemoptysis.  He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.  All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, or syncope.  He has been having
lightheadedness for the past 2 days.

TTE [**11-14**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is severe global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is at least mild aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Cardiac Cath [**11-16**]:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated an LMCA without angiographically significant
disease. The LAD was proximally occluded after D1; the D2 had a
90% lesion at its origin, but was a small vessel. The LCX was a
nondominant vessel that was proximally occluded. The RCA was
proximally occluded.
2. Graft angiography demonstrated a patent sequential SVG to OM1
and OM3. The OM1 was without critical lesions, the OM3 was
widely patent; the inferior pole of OM2 had a 90% lesion at the
origin. The SVG to RCA was widely patent. The LIMA to LAD was
patent.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed very mild systemic
arterial hypertension.
4. Selective angiography showed a tortuous left subclavian
artery, but there were no critical lesions or pressure gradient.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD and patent SVGs.
3. Tortuous left subclavian without critical lesions or pressure
gradient.

CXR [**11-19**]:   Two views of the chest are compared to the prior
examination dated [**2195-11-18**].  Allowing for differences in
technique there is no significant interval change.  Small
bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  There is a stable left
retrocardiac opacity likely reflects underlying atelectasis
and/or consolidation.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is a
pacer device that projects over the left hemithorax with two
leads terminating within the expected region of the right
ventricle and one appears to be terminating within the right
atrium.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Cardiac
Rhythm: The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 827**] on [**2195-11-13**] with VT storm.  He was loaded with an
IV amiodarone drip which was switched to 400 mg amiodarone po
bid after 24 hours. On [**2195-11-16**], he underwent cardiac
catheterization.  To determine if the patient's VT was secondary
to ischemia, he had a cardiac catherization. This demonstrated
severe native vessel disease but with patent bypass grafts.
Specifically, he had a patent sequential SVG to OM1 and OM3.
The OM1 and OM3 were widely patent without critical lesions.  In
the inferior pole of OM2, he had a 90% lesion at the origin.
The SVG to RCA was patent as was the LIMA to LAD. On [**2195-11-17**],
he underwent diagnostic electrophysiology study.  This
demonstrated inducible monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in
the RV outflow tract and apex which was ablated. In addition,
the decision was made to upgrade his pacemaker with an atrial
lead to a dual chambe
