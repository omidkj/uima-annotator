HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87 year old woman who
presents from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Nursing Home who is nonverbal at
baseline with fevers to 102.0, an elevated lactate,
borderline tachycardia and now hemodynamically instability.
At the nursing home his temperature has been noted to be
increased for the past four days.  The patient was started on
Levaquin on [**2175-3-14**], at the nursing home, however,
continued to spike a fever.  Diagnosis was presumptive
pneumonia at that time.  Given continued fevers, Clindamycin
was added at 300 mg t.i.d. for question of aspiration
coverage.  She was also started on nebulizers on [**2175-3-14**].  The family states that she was recently hospitalized
for an infection at [**Hospital6 2910**] and her
discharge summary from [**Hospital6 2910**] noted
that the patient had Staphylococcus septicemia, however,
blood cultures were only 1 out of 2 positive for coagulase
negative Staphylococcus.  The patient per family has been in
the hospital, in and out four times this year, initially
since [**Month (only) 404**] and in [**Month (only) 956**] and then in [**Month (only) 958**], and then
here.  Mostly she goes to [**Hospital6 2910**].  She
has had infections including Clostridium difficile colitis in
[**Month (only) 404**], pneumonias and fevers over the course of her stay
and over the course of this year.

temperature maximum 102.0, pulse 79, blood pressure 126/54,
respiratory rate 24, saturations 100% on 4 liters, nasal
cannula.  In general, she was nonverbal, noncooperative in no
acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, unable to
examine eyes.  Oropharynx was clear.  Membranes were dry.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm.  Distant
heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary, clear

Abdomen was soft, obese, tympanitic, nontender, active bowel
sounds.  Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema,
contracted extremities and palpable dorsalis pedis
bilaterally.  Neurological, noncooperative examination and
nonverbal.  Skin was warm, dry and intact with no evidence of
any breakdown.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed a
white count of 10.0 with 60% neutrophils, 33% lymphocytes,
hematocrit 45.7, platelets 137, sodium 152, potassium 4.1,
chloride 119, bicarbonate 21, BUN 35, creatinine 0.9, glucose
180, calcium 9.6, magnesium 35.5, phosphorus 2.4.  AST, ALT
of 44 and 53.  Lactate of 4.4.  INR 1.2.  Urine cultures
pending, blood cultures pending.  Urinalysis with small
leukocytes, large blood, 30 protein, trace ketones, greater
than 50 red blood cells, 11 to 20 white blood cells and 6 to
10 epithelial cells.

Chest x-ray, the patient was markedly rotated.  Lungs clear
with no pleural effusions.  Marked osteopenia.  Elevation of
the right hemidiaphragm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was an 87 year old woman who presents
from a nursing home with fevers to 102, tachypnea and lactate
of 4.4.

1.  Fevers - The patient came in with fevers to 102, elevated
lactate and was initially admitted under the sepsis protocol,
and she had right subclavian line placed for access and was
hydrated aggressively initially.  Source of infection was
initially unclear, most likely from positive urinalysis.  She
had a urinary tract infection.  Urine cultures have been
negative to date and blood cultures have been negative to
date.  Sputum cultures did show coagulase positive
Staphylococcus aureus, however, this was a bad sample and
likely represents colonization.  The patient was not treated
for this.  There were no plans to treat.  The patient's chest
x-ray and repeat showed no evidence of pneumonia and were
otherwise stable.  Otherwise the patient defervesced after
her initial temperature.  The patient was started on the
Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone which she tolerated without
difficulty.  These were dosed for her creatinine clearance.
As the patient remained afebrile and no clear source of an
infection was identified except for a positive urinalysis,
the patient's antibiotics of Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone were
discontinued.

2.  Hyponatremia - The patient was hyponatremic on admission
with sodium of 152 likely secondary to hypovolemia in light
of the patient's fevers and .....................  The
patient was hydrated aggressively initially and then was
gentle intravenous hydration.  Her sodium improved to 138 and
her fluids were discontinued.

3. Dementia and nonverbal state - Per family back at baseline
she does not communicate, can grimace to pain and will eat
with urging of family members.  The patient's family
confirmed her functional status and the patient was back to
her baseline per her family.  She was continued on her
Zoloft, her Depakote and prn Haldol were on hold during the
course of her admission here.  The patient continued to eat
when encouraged by her family or nursing staff and was taking
reasonable p.o. and her intravenous with hydration was
discontinued.

4.  Diabetes - The patient is stable with initially elevated
blood sugars on admission, likely secondary to response from
her infection is possible.  The patient's family notes that
her blood sugar was only out of control on her initial
admission to the hospital and then resolved.  The patient's
blood sugars by the end of her stay were in the 1-teens to
120s, and will be discharged on home on Glyburide with
sliding scale insulin as needed.

5.  Coronary artery disease - The patient is status post
inferior myocardial infarction per history.  She was started
on a statin here at 80 mg dosed, because of the light
troponin leak on admission which was attributed to demand
ischemia.  She had no electrocardiogram changes.  Eventually
may consider starting the patient on beta blocker, ACE
inhibitor as blood pressure will tolerate.

6.  Anemia - The patient had a stable hematocrit during the
course of her stay and has no anemia of chronic disease and
will continue to follow upon discharge.

7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - The patient was
stable, no evidence of wheezing on examination.  She was
continued on prn Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers as needed.

8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease - The patient was
continued on her dosing of her Zantac.

9.  Aspiration - The patient was aspiration risk, had speech
and swallow evaluation for which she passed and just
recommend p.o. diet consisting of pureed solids and thin
liquids and she requires one to one assistance with all p.o.
and medications be crushed if possible or in liquid form, and
she is only to take thin liquids through a straw and
basically maintain basic aspiration precautions including
sitting upright after meals.  Otherwise the patient was
stable on this regimen and the patient's p.o. intake improved
over the course of her stay.

10. Code status was confirmed in a family meeting to be
Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate.
