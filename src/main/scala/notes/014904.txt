CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: 76 year old man s/p fall down stairs
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man s/p fall down stairs
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
76 year old man s/p fall down stairs
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 76-year-old male status post fall downstairs.

COMPARISONS: Chest radiograph performed earlier the same date at
1451 hours.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT contiguous axial images were obtained from the
thoracic inlet through the mid abdomen without administration of
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reconstructions were
performed.

CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Calcifications are seen
within the coronary vessels and aortic arch. Evaluation of the
vascular structures is limited due to lack of contrast, however,
there is no evidence for aneurysmal dilatation or aortic
intramural hematoma. The esophagus is fluid filled along its
entirety and there is a moderate fluid-filled hiatal hernia. No
pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
nodes are noted. There are multiple fractures involving the
right lateral fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and
eleventh ribs. The six, seventh, eighth and ninth rib fractures
are moderately displaced. There is a small amount of right
basilar pneumothorax, with a moderate high-attenuation right
pleural effusion consistent with a hemopneumothorax. The lungs
demonstrate mild focal pleural thickening and a small thin-
walled bulla at the right apex. Moderate ground-glass and
nodular opacification at the right lung base may represent
aspiration versus atelectasis. No pericardial effusion is seen.

In the upper imaged abdomen, displaced eighth, ninth and tenth
rib fractures appear to contact the lateral margin of the liver
and underlying hepatic laceration cannot be excluded on this
study. There is moderate hyperdense stranding in the
retroperitoneum surrounding the inferior liver edge and right
kidney consistent with retroperitoneal hematoma, incompletely
assessed. There is significant distention of the fluid filled
stomach. The imaged spleen appears grossly unremarkable. There
is a trace amount of free air inferior to the right liver
(series 2, image 47).

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified. In addition to the numerous right-sided rib
fractures described above, there are minimally displaced
fractures involving the right transverse processes of the T3,
T6, T7, T8, vertebral bodies. Vertebral body and disc space
heights are preserved.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple right-sided rib fractures, several displaced, with a
moderate right hemothorax. Small anterior pneumothorax at the
right lung base. Right basilar ground- glass and nodular opacity
may represent aspiration versus atelectasis.
2. Small-to-moderate amount of right retroperitoneal hematoma in
the imaged portion of the upper abdomen. Displaced rib fractures
abut the lateral margin of the right hepatic lobe. Hepatic
laceration cannot be excluded on this study.
3. Massive fluid distention of the stomach and esophagus.
Decompression with a nasogastric tube is recommended.
4. Minimally displaced fractures involving multiple right
transverse processes as described above.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: ?ICH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with fall down stairs and retrograde amnesia and
nausea & head lac
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?ICH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 76-year-old male status post fall presenting with
retrograde amnesia and nausea.

COMPARISONS: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT contiguous axial images were obtained through
the head without intravenous contrast. Multiplanar
reconstructions were performed.

CT HEAD WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is no evidence of
intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures, mass effect or hydrocephalus. No major or minor
vascular territorial infarct is identified. The ventricles and
sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. The basal
cisterns are not effaced. No fractures are identified on the
bone algorithm windows. Soft tissue irregularity, subcutaneous
emphysema and subgaleal hematoma along the right convexity at
the vertex. There is a small fluid level with mucosal thickening
in the right maxillary antrum. Mild mucosal thickening is also
present within the ethmoid air cells. The remainder of the
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence for acute intracranial pathology including
hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Evidence of scalp laceration and subgaleal hematoma along the
vertex. No radiopaque embedded foreign bodies are seen.
3. Mucosal thickening and air-fluid level in the right maxillary
sinus without evidence for fracture, likely reflecting
sinusitis.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: assess lung expansion, for post pull PTX

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with R. chest tube removed now
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess lung expansion, for post pull PTX
CHEST X-RAY

HISTORY: Chest tube removal. Check for pneumothorax.

Three views. Comparison with the previous study done [**2200-1-30**].
The patient is status post trauma with multiple right rib
fractures. A right chest tube has been removed. There are tiny
circumscribed lucencies at the periphery of the right lung that
may represent minimal pleural air. Significant pneumothorax is
identified, however. Pleural thickening and/or fluid is again
demonstrated laterally on the right. There is subsegmental
atelectasis or scarring in the right lung. The left lung appears
clear except for blunting of the costophrenic sulcus. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Degenerative
arthritic changes are again noted in the spine. There is a small
amount of subcutaneous emphysema on the right, as before.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of significant right pneumothorax post
chest tube removal. Small lucencies noted in the right chest may
represent minimal pleural air on that side. There is evidence
for pleural thickening and/or fluid on the right and a small
left pleural effusion. There is persistent mild subcutaneous
emphysema on the right.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the trauma ICU, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Attending
Physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] respiratory status was monitored closely and
serial hematocrits were followed. On the morning of HD 2, he was
noted to have difficulty maintaining his O2 saturation. A chest
x-ray was performed, and an ABG was obtained. Tension
pneumothorax was suspected. He was intubated and needle
decompression followed by chest tube placement was performed. A
central li
