Imaging:
CXR on admission [**6-25**]:
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are decreased since the prior exam. A
hazy opacity
projects over the right lung base on PA projection without a
clear correlate on lateral image. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. No
effusion or pneumothorax is present. Several expansile blastic
metastases are again seen, most notably in the anterior left
sixth rib. Healed fractures of the lateral aspects of several
right middle ribs with associated pleural thickening is
unchanged.  Calcifications of the thoracic aorta are stable.
IMPRESSION: Right lung base opacity/consolidation raising
concern for
pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.

CXR prior to intubation [**6-26**]:
Comparison film [**6-25**]. There is increasing opacification in
both the right and left lungs and I suspect that most of this is
due to failure rather than a diffuse spread of pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Cardiac failure.

CXR [**6-28**]:
HISTORY: ARDS versus severe pneumonia.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-27**], there has been a
dramatic
decrease in bilateral pulmonary opacifications. Rapid clearing
suggests a
flash pulmonary edema in a patient with some enlargement of the
cardiac
silhouette. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia at this time.
The
endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in place.
Evidence of previous right rib fractures with expansion of what
appears to be the seventh or eighth ribs on the left, apparently
consistent with the
patient's known metastatic disease.

CXR [**6-29**]:
The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral multifocal
airspace opacities.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The
mediastinal silhouette is widened but unchanged. The hilar
contours are normal. There is a confluent left lower lobe
opacity. No definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax is
present. An NG tube appears out
