SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives in [**Location 10022**] with her husband.  She
has no toxic habits.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is afebrile, pulse 72, BP 130/70,
respirations 24, O2 sat 94% on room air, 5'3", weighs 210
pounds.  She is alert and oriented x 3 in no apparent
distress.  Her heart is regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs.  Lungs have scattered crackles which are greater on
the left side.  Her abdomen is obese but soft with bowel
sounds.  She is nontender, nondistended.  She is guaiac
negative.  She has slightly palpable pulses with capillary
refill less than 2 seconds.

LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count 9.7, hematocrit
27.4, platelets 185, sodium 147, potassium 4.4, chloride 104,
bicarb 24, BUN 81, creatinine 5.7, glucose 163, PT 13.5, PTT
25.4, INR 1.2.  Her urinalysis was negative.  She is CMV
negative and EBV negative.  Her EKG showed no ischemic
changes.  A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary failure with
bilateral pleural effusions, left side greater than the right
side.  Stress test, per the patient, was within normal
limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  So, the patient was admitted to transplant
surgery.  She was consented for a transplant, and she was
brought to the operating room.  In the operating room, the
patient received immunosuppression with ATG, thymoglobulin
125 mg, Solu-Medrol IV 500 mg, and CellCept 1 gm IV.  She
also received antibiotic prophylaxis with Unasyn and
Diflucan.  The ATG was continued for 3 days, and the
Solu-Medrol was gradually tapered down to 20 mg qd by the
time the patient was discharged, and the CellCept was
continued at 1 mg qd.  She is also on antibiotic prophylaxis
at the time of her discharge with bactrim, Valcyte, and oral
nystatin qid.

Ms. [**Known lastname 97656**] transplanted kidney began functioning very well
almost immediately, and by postoperative day #6, the
patient's creatinine was down to 1.3.  She has been making
good urine.  An ultrasound of the transplanted kidney on
postoperative day #1 showed no perinephric collections, and
normal arterial and venous blood flow with normal resistive
indices.  Postoperatively, the patient's pain control issues
were monitored with opiates, and she will go home on
percocet.

On postoperative day #5, the patient complained of fluid
leakage from the inferior portion of her abdominal wound.
Several of the inferior staples were removed from her wound,
and a gush of serosanguineous fluid was expelled.  This was
sent for culture and followed with wet-to-dry dressing
changes q shift.  There were no signs of infection about this
seroma site, and the patient's fascial layer underneath was
intact.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  On postop day #2, the patient was started on
her hypertensive medicines, and her blood pressure has been
under good control since admission.

RESPIRATORY:  She has had no issues.

GI:  Soon after the surgery, she began tolerating a PO diet
and was slowly advanced to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diabetic diet which she
tolerated well without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.

RENAL:  The patient did postoperatively start making urine,
and her creatinine dropped, as was previously mentioned.  She
also did suffer some electrolyte abnormalities, hyponatremia,
hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

Finally, the patient's last major issue is her mobility.  The
patient's ability to move around is hampered by her weight
and her chronic leg weakness.  Her weakness and pain in her
legs is exacerbated by the hypervolemic state following
surgery, and she has been held in the hospital for several
days now awaiting placement in an appropriate rehab facility.
Therefore, the patient is being discharged today, on [**9-12**], with the following diagnoses on the following
medications:

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Tacrolimus 4 mg po bid.
2. Prednisone 20 mg qd.

6. Nystatin swish and swallow 5 cc po qid.
7. Norvasc 10 qd.
