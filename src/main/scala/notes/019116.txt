Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Pancreatic cystic lesion in neck of pancreas


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Exploratory laparotomy.
2.  Central partial pancreatectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis
    and reconstruction.
3.  Repair of strangulated ventral hernia.
4.  Extended adhesiolysis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64-year-old kidney transplant recipient and has
multiple other medical health issues including diabetes, COPD,
peripheral vascular
disease and coronary artery disease. He has been followed for
a cystic lesion in his pancreas and recently this showed
growth up to a size of 1.5 cm now. This has changed from 2
years ago at which point it was 0.8 cm. An endoscopic
ultrasound was performed to evaluate this and an aspirate of
the lesion yielded a CEA level of 9100. The amylase content
in this was also elevated. There was also concern of other
cystic lesions throughout the pancreas and he was thought to
perhaps have IPMT. Preoperative MRI, however, distinguished
this dominant lesion in the neck of the pancreas to be
distinct from the pancreatic duct. There was one other
smaller cystic lesion in the uncinate process, but distal
glandular cysts were actually felt to be the sequelae of
chronic pancreatitis from a pancreas divisum which was
obvious on the MR as well.

At the request of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**] [**Name (STitle) 2161**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was asked to see
Mr.
[**Known lastname **] about this pancreatic cyst.  After long discussions with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient decided to have surgery.

DIAGNOSIS:

I. Pancreatic neck cyst, excision (A-F):
1. Inflammatory pseudocyst with fibrotic wall.
2. Tiny foci of ductal low grade dysplasia (PanIN  II).
3. No carcinoma.

II. Pancreas distal margin (G-K):
1. Tiny focus of intraductal PanIN I.
2. Otherwise within normal limits.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient tolerated the surgery [see operative note for
further details] and was immediately transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit [SICU] where he remained for 10 days.  He
was intubated for about a week while in the ICU.
Post-operatively, he was also followed by Renal transplant as
well as Infectious Disease for MRSA, VRE, and Candidal
infections.  His hospital course was also complicated by poor
wound healing and cellulitis around the incision area, in which
staples had to be removed.  His abdomenal wound was intially
packed with wet-to-dries and then wound vac was placed to
promote granulation.  He was switched back to wet-to-dries, and
his wound is currently looking healthy with good granulation
tissue.  Due to his multiple morbities, extensive surgery,  and
a fluid collection in the pancreatic bed post-op, a decision was
made to have the patient be on bowel rest and be given TPN to
support his caloric needs.  With antibiotics, TPN, and support
of the physical therapists, the patient has done quite well
after being transferred to the surgical floor.  He has been
afebrile for over a week, while ambulating with some assistance,
and producing good urine.  He will be discharged to a
rehabilitation center in stable condition with specific
instructions for post-hospital care as well as follow-up.
