CXR ([**2159-9-2**]):
1. Marked cardiomegaly, stable.
2. Interval improvement in the degree of congestive heart
failure with a tiny right pleural effusion.
3. Stable appearance of the transvenous pacemaker and leads.
.
CT Torso ([**2159-9-2**]):
1. Likely small subsegmental nonocclusive lingular pulmonary
embolus.
2. Heterogeneous right nephrogram, new from [**2159-7-31**], is
pyelonephritis versus renal infarcts.
3. A moderate right pleural effusion. (enlarged from [**2159-7-31**]), and small ascites (relatively unchanged).
.
Echo [**2159-9-3**]:
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2159-6-12**],the findings are
similar.
.
Echo [**2159-9-4**]:
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. No definite
thrombus identified (cannot definitively exclude). Spontaneous
echo contrast is noted in the left heart consistent with slow
flow. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is moderate
to severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year-old M with nonischemic dilated CMP with EF<20%, multiple
VTE (DVT/PE) who presents with persistent epigastric pain
initially admitted to medicine, transfered to the MICU due to
hypotension on the same day, then CCU the next day for further
management of CHF (tailored therapy).  His hospital course for
this admission is as follows:
.
1 CHF: Severe systolic CHF with EF <20% with moderate MR,
hypotension likely secondary to poor cardiac output.   We
continued his digoxin at home dose.  Central line was placed,
and he was started on dobutamine drip tailored therapy at
15/kg/min on [**2159-9-4**] which was gradually weaned to 12mcg/kg/min
on [**2159-9-6**], and weaned completely on [**2159-9-7**] and his central
line was pulled on the same day.  We monitored him closely for
arrythmias on the tele while he was on the dobutamine drip.
Lasix, [**Last Name (un) **], and spironolactone was held initially given
increased Cr, while he was at the CCU, [**Last Name (un) **] (valsartan 40''),
lasix 40', aldactone 25' was restarted once his Cr function was
back to his baseline.  He was held on most of his heart failure
meds given BP parameter setting (SBP<95), but we adjusted the
parameter to hold meds for SBP<85, and the decision was made not
to take him for right heart cath at the time since he was able
to tolerate his heart failure meds with changing parameters.  He
was discharged home with valsartan 40mg PO qhs, lasix 80mg PO
qday, aldactone 25mg PO qday, digoxin 0.125mg PO qday.
.
2 Ischmia. No CP, no h/o CAD. initial troponin and CK negative.
.
3 Rhythm. pt had sinus tach, likely [**3-1**] to low cardiac output,
anticipate improvement.
.
4 Abdominal Pain. Leading diagnosis is congestion from CHF
causing pain from liver capsule expansion. Somewhat responsive
to PPI. He continued to complained abdominal pain while in the
hopsital, and seemed to improved with pain management.  CT torso
initially was unrevealing.  We fo
