Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**]
Chief Complaint:
RUQ, epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) **] w/placement of 7cm by 10FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent

History of Present Illness:
85 yo M with h/o CAD s/p 2 vessel CABG, s/p bioprosthetic AVR,
HTN, HL, and CRI who presents with RUQ and epigastric pain X 1
week.  Pt reports that 1.5 weeks ago pt awoke with RUQ and
epigastric pain and subjective fevers.  He describes his pain as
constant burning with sharp pains, rating [**5-6**], no radiation,
worse after eating (up to [**9-6**]), and relieved with vomiting.  Pt
had seen his NP who recommended treatment for GERD with Maalox,
Zantac, and Tums.  The following day, pt develop nausea and
vomiting (nonbloody, ?bilious) with any attempt with po intake.
He has not been able to eat or take his medications for a week.
He returned to see the NP and was prescribed omeprazole, to
which he developed an itchy rash and was discontinued.  He
denies any constipation, diarrhea, or BRBPR.  He reports 2 dark
stools over the weekend.  He also endorses dark urine, low urine
output, and "wooziness."  Without improvement, pt presented to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **] [**Name (NI) 620**] [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be in afib with
RVR to rate of 170s, tolerated by BP in 110s/60s.  Tmax of 102.6
with shaking chills.  Labs notable for WBC 12.5 with left shift,
lactate 7.5, AST 212, ALT 318, AlkPhos 703, and TBili 10.48.  CK
87, CK MB 1.7, TropT 0.027.  Pt received cipro, flagyl, and
zofran.  Given suspicion for biliary related sepsis and need for
[**Name (NI) **], pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 86**].

In the ED, initial VS were:  T99.2, 160, 107/88, 14, 94% on 4L.
Repeat labs notable for lactate 1.9, AST 172, ALT 228, AlkPhos
470, TBili 9.8, CK 308, MB 26, MBI 8.4, Trop 0.57.  He was given
zosyn 4.5 gm IV X 1, morphine 4 mg x1.  EKG with afib with RVR.
Pt was given ASA and diltiazem 15 mg IV X 1 with improvement in
HR from 150s to 100s but also dropped his SBPs to 60s briefly,
which came up to 80s.  Pt was given reversal with IV calcium
gluconate, RIJ TLC placed, and started on norepinephrine gtt.
Currently in NSR with HR in 80s. He was reportedly mentating
during this episode.  Cardiology consulted for positive CEs, who
felt this was more demand related and did not recommend heparin
gtt. [**Location (un) **] and surgery were both contact[**Name (NI) **] who recommended
admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with [**Hospital Unit Name **].  He received 3 L NS in the ED.

Currently patient denies any abdominal pain, N/V.  He only
complains of a dry mouth.

ROS:  As above.  Pt denied any headaches.  He reported some
rhinorrhea but no cough, sob.  No chest pain, palpitations.  No
orthopnea, PND, pedal edema.

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p 2 vessel CABG and bioprosthetic AVR in [**2198**]:  left
internal  mammary  artery  to  the  left  anterior descending
coronary  artery, reverse saphenous vein graft from the aorta to
the obtuse marginal coronary artery.
HTN

Social History:
Patient lives with his wife and acts as her caretaker as she has
mild dementia.  He was trained as a merchant [**Hospital1 **] but worked
in construction after he got married.  He previously smoked [**1-31**]
ppd x30 years, quit in [**2164**].  He has 3 alcoholic drinks a year.
No recreational drug use.

Family History:

STUDIES:
RUQ U/S:  Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis or
biliary ductal dilatation.

CXR:  No new focal consolidation or edema. Possible right heart
failure or portosystemic shunting.

EKG:  NSR at 75.  RBBB.  STD in V1, TWI in V1 (old), TWI in III.
 No STE.

TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for
this type of prosthesis. The aortic valve prosthesis cannot be
adequately assessed (leaflets not well seen duet o acoustic
shadowing). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least
moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior report of [**2199-2-12**], a
bioprosthetic AVR is now seen. LVEF has normalized.

[**Year (4 digits) **]: A single periampullary diverticulum with large opening was
found at the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was
successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand
technique. Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification. A mild diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct
with the CBD measuring 10mm. A single 6mm round stone was seen
at the biliary tree. A 7cm by 10FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent
was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent introducer kit.
Good flow of thick and purulent bile was noted following biliary
stent placement. Normal limited pancreatogram.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG and AVR, HTN, and CRI who presents
with RUQ pain, sepsis, elevated LFTs in an obstructive pattern,
and positive CEs.
.
#) Sepsis/Cholangitis/Bacteremia - In setting of elevated WBC,
tachycardia, hypotension (although this was in setting of
getting IV diltiazem), initial elevated lactate, and likely
source for infection. RUQ U/S in ED did not reveal any CBD
dilation; however, given clinical concern for cholangitis, the
pt underwent an urgent [**Doctor Last Name **] in which a 6 mm CBD stone was
visualized along with diffuse dilation of the CBD up to 10 mm.
The CBD stone was extracted, biliary stent placed, and
sphincterotomy was not performed given concern about the pt's
cardiac enzymes and possible need for anti-coagulation (see
below). He was initially given cipro, flagyl at the OSH ED and
was given zosyn, cipro upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was continued
on IV cipro/zosyn overnight without further fevers.  Blood cxs
showed pan-sensitive E. coli. He was initially on levophed gtt
for hypotension, which was easily weaned off upon arrival to the
ICU without need for further IVF boluses. As pt remained HD
stable overnight, he was transferred to the surgery service for
further care by hospital day 2. Per surgery, the pt will need a
cholecystectomy in the future.
.
#) Positive cardiac biomarkers:  Likely secondary to demand
ischemia in the setting of biliary sepsis and developement of
atrial fibrillation with RVR to 150s.  Troponin peaked at 0.63,
CK peaked at 434. EKG without specific changes to suggest
ischemia.  Cardi
