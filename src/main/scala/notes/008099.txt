CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2166-1-14**]
1. Stable diffuse intracranial subarachnoid and intraventricular
hemorrhage with some degree of edema. No hydrocephalus.
2. A 7 x 5 x 4 mm saccular anterior communicating artery
aneurysm, described above.

[**2166-1-14**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:

Stomach is moderately distended with air and fluid. Lungs are
clear. Heart
size is normal. No pleural, hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.

[**2166-1-14**] CTA HEAD
FINDINGS:
CT HEAD: Hyperdense hemorrhage is present within the upper
spinal canal,
pontocerebellar and basal cisterns, bilateral Sylvian fissures
and the
anterior interhemispheric fissure extending along the anterior
falx. There is
also intraventricular hemorrhage layering within the occipital
horns
bilaterally. There is bihemispheric diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrage. The acute
intracranial hemorrage is similar to that seen on the outside
study performed
earlier the same day. The sulci do not appear significantly
effaced athough
the presence of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage limits
evalation of early
cerebral edema. The ventricular system is not enlarged.

The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. No evidence
of large
territorial infarction is demonstrated. No significant mass
effect or shift
of midline structures is present. There is minimal mucosal
thickening within
the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. The remaining paranasal
sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.

CTA HEAD: An irregular anterior communicating artery aneurysm is
present,
possibly originating slightly to the right, pointed anteriorly,
slightly
inferiorly and leftward measuring 7 x 5 x 4 mm.

The intracranial ICA and MCA arteries and branches are normal in
contrast
enhancement and caliber. Bilateral A1 segments and A2 segments
are also
normal in caliber and contrast enhancement. The left vertebral
artery is
dominant. There is fenestration of the proximal Basilar artery.
The Basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries are otherwise
normal in appearance, contrast enhancement, and caliber.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable diffuse intracranial subarachnoid and intraventricular
hemorrhage with some degree of edema. No hydrocephalus.

2. A 7 x 5 x 4 mm saccular anterior communicating artery
aneurysm, described above.

[**2166-1-15**] CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND COILING OF ANEURYSM
VESSELS SELECTED: Right internal carotid artery angiogram, left
common
carotid artery angiogram, left vertebral artery angiogram and
right common
femoral artery angiogram.

INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE: Coil embolization of anterior
communicating artery aneurysm.

TECHNIQUE: The patient is status post intubation. The patient
was placed in the neurointerventional biplane table and both
groins were prepped in a
standard sterile fashion. A preprocedure timeout and huddle was
performed
documenting the patient's identity using various identifiers,
nature of the procedure, lab parameters and patient's history.
The right common femoral artery was accessed using a
micropuncture set. Over a wire, the micropuncture set was
exchanged for a 6 French Terumo sheath. The wire was removed and
a 5 French [**Doctor Last Name **] 2 catheter was inserted over a 0.038 angled
Glidewire. The [**Doctor Last Name **] 2 catheter was advanced into the
above-mentioned vessels and angiograms were performed in AP,
lateral and 3D projections. Using a 0.038 exchange Glidewire,
the [**Doctor Last Name **] 2 catheter was removed and exchanged with a 6 French
straight Neuron catheter. With the Neuron catheter successfully
placed in the distal right internal carotid artery, an Excelsior
microcatheter was advanced through the Neuron catheter over a
Synchro wire and successfully navigated into the right anterior
communicating artery/right A2 segment aneurysm. With the
microcatheter in place, a series of GDC detachable soft coils 4
mm/8 cm, soft and ultrasoft 2 mm/4 cm coils were successfully
deployed within the aneurysm to achieve adequate occlusion.
Post-successful coiling right internal carotid artery angiogram
showed subtle aneurysmal filling. Following this, the catheters
and wires were removed. An angiogram of the right common femoral
artery showed no major occlusive disease. A 6 French Angio-Seal
closure device was used to close the right CFA puncture site. No
post-procedure Complications were observed and the patient was
returned to the
intensive care unit with post-procedure orders.

FINDINGS:

Right internal carotid artery angiogram demonstrated a 6.3 mm x
4.8 mm
saccular aneurysm, incorporating the anterior communicating
artery and right A2 segment. The right middle cerebral and
anterior cerebral arteries showed normal opacification and
branching pattern with no changes in luminal caliber before and
after coiling of the aneurysm.

Left common carotid artery arteriogram demonstrated normal
filling of the left internal and external carotid arteries and
their major branches. The left middle cerebral and anterior
cerebral arteries showed normal opacification and branching
pattern with no evidence of significant filling of the ACom
aneurysm in the pre-coiling state.

Left vertebral artery arteriogram demonstrated normal
opacification of the
left vertebral artery and brisk filling
