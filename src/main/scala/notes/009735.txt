History of Present Illness:
This is a very pleasant 54 yo female w/ pmh significant for L
breast CA-invasive ductal cancer in [**2169**], s/p lumpectomy with
chemo followed by taxol and radiation tx, hx of 45 pack years of
smoking, COPD, Polycythemia and recent dx of stage IV lung Ca
(adenocarcinoma) who comes in today for hypoxia and increase in
SOB. Pt states that she has been using home O2-2L with sats in
at 88-90% for the last month since her dx of lung CA a few weeks
ago. On Wed she went to see her new PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 92442**] [**Name (STitle) 92443**],
due to change insurance coverage, who obtained a CXR at [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Location (un) 620**] which showed RML infiltrate and she was started on
moxifloxin. She denies having any fever or chills at the time
and her cough seems to be improving on tessalon pearls and
guaifenasine-codeine. Her SOB has been stable at home for the
last several days until today when she was off the oxygen for ~
2hours while travelling to see her doctor. She also walked
around at [**Company 12679**] prior to her appointment. She then had
increase in SOB "difficult catching her breath". On arrival to
her PCP office her O2 sat was 78% on RA. She was started on
Oxygen and sent to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED. On arrival to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] her
vitals were: 98.5 HR: 104 BP: 132/68 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat: 88 2 L
Low. Her labs at the time were notable for WBC 8.4/Hgb 16.4/Hct
50.6/ MCV 98.2/ Plats of 257, no diff. BUN of 7/creat of 0.4.
Her D.dimer of 0.8 (normal range of 0-0.49), so she had a CTA
earlier in the day which showed no PE but a lung tumor pressing
on right bronchial and pulmonary artery (prelim report). She was
then transfer to our ED for admission to oncology. Pt has an
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week (new patient eval).

On arrival to our ED her vitals were: 97.2 99 124/69 20 92% 4L.
As per note she was in no appearent distress. Her O2 sats
remained in the low 90s on 4L N/C. She was given nebs and
started on vanco and zosyn for the pna previously seem on cxray
on [**12-2**]. She was then admitted to the ICU due to her O2
requirement and for further monitoring.

On transfer her vitals were: 97.8ta. HR: 104. BP: 122/68. O2:
91% 4lnc. RR 20. She appears well and breathing without any
difficulty. She is accompanied by her 2 children.

ROS: As per HPI, she denies any fever, chills, no wt loss (wt
gain in the last few months), baseline fatigue for the last few
months. Baseline SOB on home O2 at 2L N/c, + non-productive
cough which is improving over the last few days with meds. No
chest pain, no LE edema. Decrease in appetite, no abd pain, no
n/v, no change in her bowel movements. + abd lumps that she
initially noticed in [**Month (only) **]. No bloody stools/no melena. No

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGY HISTORY:
-[**2169**] She was noted to have a 1.5-2.0 cm area of nodularity in
the left breast on examination. A core biopsy was nondiagnostic.
      [**2170-4-28**] she had an excisional biopsy performed. This
showed a 0.9 cm moderately differentiated invasive ductal
cancer. There was DCIS comprising about 5% of the mass. There
was LCIS present. There was no LVI. The cancer was noted to be
ER positive, PR positive and HER 2/neu negative. There was as
positive margin.
-[**5-2**] she underwent a left breast reexcision and sentinel LN
mapping procedure. This showed invasive ductal cancer,
moderately differentiated in several foci around the biopsy
cavity. The largest foci measured 1.5 cm. There was DCIS as well
but the margins were negative for both invasive and in-situ
cancer. There was LCIS present. A single sentinel LN was
identified and this was positive for a metastases measuring 4
mm.
-[**6-1**] She had a completion axillary dissection which showed that
12 additional axillary LN were negative.
- [**Date range (1) 92444**] she received chemotherapy with "dose dense" CA for
4 cycles followed by 4 cycles of taxol.
-[**Date range (1) 92445**] she received breast irradiation under the direction
of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
-[**Date range (1) 92446**] She was treated with tamoxifen
-[**Date range (1) 92447**] she completed a 5 year course of aromasin
-[**Date range (3) 92448**] She was admitted to the [**Hospital6 **] for
bilobar pneumonia and hypoxia. Her initial O2 sat was 77% on RA.
She was given antibiotics and nebulizers. She had a Chest CT on
[**2178-1-9**] which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus. There
were enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with bronchial
cutoff and RML collapse and partial LLL collapse, as well as
bilateral adrenal masses and ?left hepatic lobe lesion. An MRI
of the abdomen on [**2178-1-13**] showed bilateral adrenal adenoma and
focal fatty infiltration of the medial segment of the left lobe
of the liver adjacent to the falciform ligament.
-[**2178-1-30**] She had a repeat chest CT at [**Location (un) 2274**]:
IMPRESSION: Significant improved aeration throughout all lung
zones. Residual atelectasis or small infiltrates right middle
and both lower lobes. No evidence of pathologically enlarged
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Enlarged bilateral adrenal
lesions.
-[**2178-11-5**] seen by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1356**] and reported having noticed 3 firm
masses in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen-one to the left
of the umbilicus measured 4 x 3 cm, one in the epigastrium
measured 1 x 2 cm and one in the later mid abdominal wall
measured 1 x 0.5 cm
-[**2178-11-6**] seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 92449**] who biopsied the mass in the
epigastrium. This showed metastatic adenocarcinoma. The cancer
was positive for CK7, EMA and CEA and negative for ER,
mammoglobin, CK 20, CD 10, S100, TTF-1, vimentin, RCC, PAX 8
andp63. In discussion with the pathologist-she noted that up to
22% of lung cancers may be negative for TTF-1. Differential dx
was either lung or breast cancer by morphology
-[**2178-11-13**] CT scan of the head was negative. Chest CT showed
extensive mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy. There was
compression of the right sided bronchi with atelectasis of the
RML. Abdomen/pelvic CT showed no liver metastases. Prior CT
scans showed a 2.4 cm right adrenal nodule and this was without
change. However the left adrenal nodule is now significantly
larger and more heterogenous appearing measuring 3.7 x 2.0 cm
suggesting superimposed metastatic disease. There are several SQ
nodules: there is a 3.1 cm cavity containing an air-fluid level
a the site of the biopsy (this area was included in the chest CT
from [**2-7**] and was new). There is a 8 mm nodule int he left
lateral anterior SQ fat also new. Inferiorly there are
additional nodules-largest in the left paraumbilical measuring
3.1 cm. Another nodule is seen lateral to the left acetabulum
measuring 1.7 cm, there is a right paramedian nodule posterior
to the gluteus maximus measuring 1.8. There are no bone lesions
seen.
