Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion, decreased po intake

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous nephrostomy tube on the left


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 105149**] is an 88 year old female with recurrent UTIs,
nephrolithiasis, CAD, AF on coumadin, s/p AVR and CAD who
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**11-16**] with fatigue and altered mental
status. She was found to have a urinary tract infection as well
as acute on chronic renal failure. She was started on Meropenem
given history of MDR UTIs in past. She also had a CT head which
showed a new subacute right parietal infarct. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Here, renal US showed moderate to severe left hydronephrosis. CT
Abd/pelvis showed a proximal renal stone with perinephric
stranding. Urology was consulted and recommended IR precutaneous
nephrostomy tubes. She received 4units of FFP to reverse INR
prior to procedure. Following the procedure she required 3L NC
and was noted to have an oxygen saturation of 60% on room air.
She was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring.
.
In the MICU, ABG notable for A-a gradient and CXR with bilateral
infiltrates. She was continued on meropenem and vancomycin was
added for empiric PNA coverage. She was quickly weaned from NRB
back to NC and has continued good oxygenation. She was also
briefly hypotensive after receiving IV and PO metoprolol for AF
with RVR. BP responded to fluids. She was also seen by neurology
based on CT findings and had MRI/MRA which showed a small
hemorrhage in the area of the parietal infarct. INR was 1.7 on
admission, ie subtherapeutic INR. Carotid US was done which was
unchanged from 4/[**2139**]. Based on this, neurology felt that
infarct was likely cardioembolic in origin and less likely to be
[**Country **] related. They recommended restarting heparin bridge,
aspirin and aggrenox.
.
Of note, she was recently discharged [**2140-11-13**] for UTI with left
ureteral stent removal [**2140-11-1**] and was treated with IV
Meropenum for 10 days.
.
This AM, patient denies complaints. She continues to be
confused, oriented to person only.

Past Medical History:

7. MSSA bacteremia/discitis
8. Left heel ulcer
9. Recurrent UTI's
10. History of urosepsis [**6-/2139**]-managed at [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Location (un) **].
11. History of C. difficile colitis
12. Anemia
13. history of Herpes Zoster

Social History:
Patient lives with her son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren.
At baseline, she uses a walker for ambulation. She has several
visiting home health aids that help with her ADLs. Husband
passed away about 30 years ago.

Quit smoking many years ago. Denies drug use, occasional alcohol
use (wine)at social events a few times a year.


Family History:
Mother died of colon cancer at the age of 62.
Father died of "old age" at the age of 84.
Brother died of testicular cancer at the age of 72.
Her children are all alive and in good health.

.
Imaging:
[**Location (un) 620**] Head CT: per verbal report: Acute R superior parietal
infarct suggestive of MCA lesion. Suggest MRI.
.
[**11-16**] CXR: There has been no radiographic change. The right lung
is particularly hyperinflated suggesting emphysema or chronic
small airways obstruction. No focal pulmonary abnormality is
seen. The patient has had median sternotomy, coronary bypass
grafting and aortic valve replacement. Heart size is normal.
There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement, edema or pleural
effusion.
.
[**11-16**] Renal US:  Interval development of moderate-to-severe left
hydronephrosis. No evidence of right hydronephrosis. Prominent
debris or hemorrhage layers dependently within the urinary
bladder.
.
[**11-16**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. New obstructing 7-mm calculus within the proximal left ureter
with
resultant moderate hydronephrosis and perinephric stranding.
2. Nonobstructing renal stone within the left renal pelvis.
3. Little change in 2.2 cm left adnexal cyst over two-year
period. Further
evaluation with pelvic ultrasound may be obtained to exclude
low- grade
genitourinary malignancy given postmenaupausal status.
4. Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
5. Extensive spinal degenerative changes and atherosclerotic
plaque within
the abdominal aorta and major branches.
.
[**11-16**] MR/MRA head:
The right posterior parietal infarction noted on the head CT of
[**2140-11-15**] is again identified and there is a small
amount of
hemorrhage associated with it. The MRA examination demonstrates
no
occlusions, but there is possible narrowing in the inferior
division of the
right middle cerebral artery. No other infarction is detected.
.
[**11-18**]: Echo:
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation present is
normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral
valve leaflets. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: No left atrial thrombus seen. However, transthoracic
echo is NOT accurate at determining presence or absence of
atrial thrombus. Symmetric LVH with a small cavity and
near-hyperdynamic systolic function. At least moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The aortic arch
probably has atheromatous plaque.
.
[**11-18**] Carotid US: Findings as stated above which indicate an
approximately 70% right ICA stenosis, unchanged from the exam of
[**2140-3-14**]. There is
approximately 40% left ICA stenosis, also unchanged. Possibility
of cardiac
disease.
