Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of tunneled cath (previously used for tPN)

History of Present Illness:
54yo F with Crohn's s/p ileostomy and subsequent short gut
syndrome with port-a-cath placement for TPN who presents with
progressive right sided chest pain that comes in waves. The pt
reports sharp 10/10 chest pain under the right breast which is
getting progressively worse. The pain is worsened with deep
inspiration or movement. It initially started one day previously
but has gotten significantly worse over last 12 hours. It is
associated with SOB as well as fevers, chills. The pt denies abd
pain, n/v or increased ostomy output.
.
Given her fever, sx of chest pain and SOB as well as an elevated
WBC count, she was initially thought to have a PNA. She was
therefore given ceftriaxone 1g IV x1 and azithromycin 500mg PO
x1 in the ED. As the CXR was without any evidence of PNA, or
PTX, the pt subsequently received a CTA to evaluate for PE which
revealed multifocal bilateral PNA but no PE. At this time, she
was given Vancomycin 1g IV x1. She was also given morphine 2mg
x3, 4mg IV x2, dolasetron 12.5mg x2 and ativan 1mg IV x1.


Past Medical History:
1. Crohn's disease, dx [**2131**] s/p three bowel resections and
eventual ileostomy, resulting in short gut syndrome
2. Restless leg syndrome

gut syndrome, complicated by clotting x 4, requiring replacement

.

and
tail of the pancreas with a larger cystic lesion in the tail of
the pancreas. A second 9 mm cystic lesion is seen in the head of

the pancreas. These findings are consistent with chronic
pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation

CTA [**2163-1-18**] - IMPRESSION:
1. No definite pulmonary embolism is identified.
2. Peripheral patchy opacities are seen bilaterally, most
consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2163-1-18**] - There are faint ill-defined opacities within the
right lower lung zone and left upper lung zone could represent a
multifocal pneumonic process.
.
CXR [**2163-1-27**] - IMPRESSION: Multilobar pneumonia with interval
worsening in the left lung but slight improvement in the right
lower lobe.
.
Head CT [**2163-2-3**] -
Ordered to evaluate for changes to explain delta MS
CONCLUSION: Left parietal subcortical hypodensity, likely
ischemic. No definite changes since the MR of in [**2160-6-8**].

CXR [**2163-2-3**]
IMPRESSION: Marked improvement.


Brief Hospital Course:
54yo F with Crohn's disease s/p ileostomy with subsequent short
gut syndrome with port-o-cath for TPN presents with acute onset
pleuritic chest pain with fever, chills, and sob.
.
1. Chest pain/Fever/Chills: The acute onset of chest pain was
initially very concerning for a PE, however the Chest CT
demonstrated multifocal consolidation consistent with a
bacterial PNA. This is consistent with the remainder of the pt's
history including fever, chills, sob and an elevated WBC count.
The pt was given ceftriaxone/azithromycin/vancomycin in ED.
Blood, urine and sputum culutres were sent.  Pt's blood cultures
came back positive for Staph Aureus and Enterococcus, both were
pansensitive.  Sputum culture also returned with Staph. Aureus.
Ceftriaxone and azithro were discontinued, and Vacomycin was
continued.  Pt initially was hypoxic requiring NRB for O2 sat of
94%, with any attempt to wean she would desat.  Pt was intubated
prior to tunneled catheter removal, see below.  (The tunneled
catheter later came back for negative for culture.)Earlier that
day pt had a chest x ray which showed diffuse infiltrative
process concerning for ARDS.  Post procedure pt remained
intubated on ARDSnet protocol.  She self extubated the first day
and was reintubated without any complications.  Her O2
requirement improved on the vent over the next few days and she
was weaned off the vent on [**2162-1-26**].  After extubation her o2
requirement was down to 1L NC with sats in mid 90s.  She was
transferred to the floor for further managment.
.
The patient remained afebrile when she transferred to the
medicine service.  She was weaned off the oxygen and for the
remainder of her course her O2sats were stable on room air.  The
patient had completed her antibiotic course while in house.

2. Hx of multiple port-o-cath clots: Although the pt is on
warfarin chronically, her INR was subtherapeutic. Goal INR [**2-25**].
Initially coumadin was increased, however given concern for
infected line, general surgery was consulted who removed the
line in the ICU.
.
3. ARF:  Pt initially with mild [**Doctor First Name 48**], this was thought to be due
to dehydration, after initial volume repletion her renal
function improved to her baseline.
.
4. Psych: The pt has a history of paranoia/depression.  ON
admission she was taking Quetiapine 300 mg QHS and Clonazepam
1mg QAM, 1mg Q3PM, 2 mg PO QHS.  Quetiapine was continued
however clonipin was initially held when she was intubated on
fentynyl/versed.  This was restarted post extubation.

Intially after being transferred from the ICU to the medicine
service the patient was mentating appropriately.  Her course
later became complicated by visual and auditory hallucinations.
She made disturbing comments to the hospital personnel. She was
unable to sleep at night, often pacing the halls.  She required
a 1:1 sitter. Psychiatry was consulted.  They felt that her
presentation was secondary to delirium and was multifactorial.
They attributed it to polypharmacy, recent infection (pneumonia)
and insomnia. A head CT was done which ruled out any acute
processes. The patient refused an LP. They made recommendations
for adjustments to her anti-psychotic medications.  At discharge
the patient was on clonazepam 1mg tid, seroquel 300 [**Hospital1 **] and
neurontin 600 QAM, 1200 QPM and 1200 QHS.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was prolonged because of her
delirium.  Once her mental status improved she was discharged.

.
5. ?Parkinson's Disease/ Akithesia: The patient was maintained
Sinemet.

6. Pain: In addition to her usual neuropathy pain, the pt
initially appeared to have significant pain from the multi-focal
PNA as well. (Home regi
