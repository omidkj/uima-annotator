Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2161-9-23**]
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 yo male with CAD and HTN who presented from home to
OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation, likely
secondary to foreign body aspiration, noted to have positive
cardac enzymes, LBBB on EKG and ST depressions in V4-V6 and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where was admitted to the ICU. In the ICU,
pt's LBBB was determined to be old after d/w pt's outpatient
cardiologist. Pt had an echo done that showed ant-lat
hypokinesis w/ EF 30-35% c/w LAD disease, and repeat EKG showed
that ST depressions had resolved. Cardiology felt that this was
likely rate related ischemia. Pt's troponin peaked at 0.11, and
therefore pt was being considered for cath when he was
transferred to the floor. However, pt then became febrile while
on the floor, and CXR showed likely PNA.  With pt's recent
aspiration hx, we assumed aspiration PNA.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CAD/Systolic Dysfunction: It is still unclear what provoked
patient's respiratory arrest. Given his presenting symptom prior
to the arrest was HA and nausea/vomiting this could have been
suggestive of an MI, however, pt's cath was clean, and pt did
not endorse CP prior to passing out. Unlikely that this was
related to cardiac causes. Troponin elevation likely from chest
compressions gotten at OSH. We continued pt's ASA and statin.
We did a repeat echo which showed somewhat improved ventricular
function.  We continued BB and ACE-I.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Plt count dropped from 180 ([**9-19**]) to 77
([**9-21**]), improved back to 122. Too soon to be Type II HIT and plt
count too low to be Type I HIT. Possible this is related to drug
exposure (vancomycin, levaquin and cefepime given in ED).  Plt
count continued to improve on levofloxacin and flagyl, so
continued these medications and continued to monitor.
.
# Aspiration PNA: Pt with fever and new R-sided opacity on CXR,
with hx of beef stew seen in throat, very suggestive of
aspiration PNA. We started pt on IV levo and flagyl, and then
switched them to PO for dispo. Pt had no fevers while on levo
and flagyl.  Still unclear what caused initial event of passing
out.
.
# HTN: BP mildly elevated. D/C'd felodipine and started
metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril 5mg QD, both of which we then
titrated up to 50mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and 20mg lisinopril QD, as
pt's SBP's had been 160's.
.
# Anxiety/Depression: Mood stable. We continued outpatien
regimen of sertraline and clonazepam
