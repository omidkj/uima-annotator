History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 y/o female s/p LRLT [**1-9**] c/b graft dysfunction on
transplant list, h/o VRE and Klebsiella cholangitis, HTN, CKD,
who p/w symptoms of worsening jaundice, fever to 103 at home,
and "not feeling well" over the last 1 week. After Thansgiving
day last week, she began to feel nauseous and had multiple
episodes of yellowish/bilious emesis with no hematemesis. She
also noted worsening diarrhea (has loose stools at baseline), no
melena or BRBPR and took immodium over the weekend. She
describes new LLQ pain, which is dull and throbbing in nature,
not associated with any factors and relieved with morphine
earlier in the ED. She has baseline RUQ pain of unclear etiology
that is unchanged in nature. Her UOP has decreased over the last
week and is darker, but she denies any dysuria or hematuria. She
took her temperature a few days ago and noted that is was 103,
but has not taken her temperature sicne then. Her n/v resolved
briefly until earlier yesterday when it began again. She noted
new yellowing of her skin 1 day PTA - she notes the last time
she was jaundiced was prior to her transplant. She went to the
liver clinic yesterday for follow-up and in the office, was
noted to be jaundiced with SBP's in the 70's. She was referred
to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were T 98.6, BP 76/46, HR 101, RR 29, SaO2
95%/RA. She given 4 L NS total with partial improvement in her
blood pressures initially to 90's systolic, however her
pressures dropped to the 70's systolic again. A right IJ CVL was
placed and she was started on levophed with improvement in her
MAP's to the 60's (SBP's 80's to 90's). She received
Vancomycin/CTX/flagyl for broad-spectrum coverage after she was
pan-cultured. CXR, CT abd were performed (see below for
results). She continued to mentate well throughout.

She was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 49131**] for
n/v/abdominal and diarrhea, of unclear etiology, improved with
reglan (workup including stool cultures, colonoscopy, gastic
emptying study all unremarkable). Of note, she has never had SBP
and rarely needs paracentesis - perhaps, 1-2x/year
therapeutically. She is on the transplant list for over a year
now.

Physical Exam:
VS: Tc 96.1, BP 88/64, HR 86-90, RR 30-33, SaO2 100%/2 L NC
General: jaundiced-appearing female who is fatigued, but in NAD,
AO x 3, mentating clearly
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI. +scleral icterus. MM dry, OP clear
Neck: supple, RIJ in place with minimal oozing, JVP flat
Chest: crackles over the left base, markedly diminished breath
sounds over the right base, no egophany, no wheezes
CV: RRR s1 s2 normal, no m/g/r
Abd: distended, soft, +TTP over right lower and upper quadrants
and LLQ. Liver span approximately 4 fingerbreadths past the
costal margin, spleen diffusely englarged as well.
Ext: no c/c/e, wwp with good distal pulses b/l

Pertinent Results:
[**1-4**] CXR - AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
There is a new right IJ central line with its tip in the
approximate location of the right atrium. Persistent right
hemidiaphragmatic elevation is noted with right basilar
atelectasis and pleural thickening along the lateral aspect of
the right lower lung. Left lung remains clear. Cardiomediastinal
contour is stable. There is no pneumothorax. The visualized
osseous structures remain intact. The IVC/right atrial stent is
unchanged.
.
[**1-4**] CT abd/pelvis with po contrast only -
1. New poorly defined nodular opacities at the lung bases, which
are
nonspecific, likely representing an infectious etiology. Given
history of immunosuppression, atypical infection such as fungal
infection cannot be entirely excluded.
2. Moderate intra-abdominal ascites.
3. Resolved bowel wall thickening.
4. New small right-sided pleural effusion.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 y/o female with alcoholic cirrhosis, s/p LRLT [**2159**] c/b graft
dysfunction, now p/w fever, hypotension, LLQ abdominal pain. She
met septic shock criteria on admission, requiring pressors
(levophed/vasopression) for her hypotension. Patient was
subsequently found to have MRSA bacteremia, large RA clot
extending from the IVC stent that was placed after the graft
implantation, the course complicated by septic embolic,  and
subsuquent respiratory distress requiring ICU readmission.
Patient becoming more lethargic, aspirating, with a L effusion
concerning for empyema s/p chest tube placement on the left,
with transient improvement but change of goals of care to
DNR/DNI/CMO.  The patient passed away on [**2164-2-8**], approximately 5
hours after care was withdrawn.

# ID/sepsis - She was initially started on broad-spectrum
antibiotics (dapto, caspo, flagyl, cefepime) which was tapered
to Vancomycin when she grew out [**5-11**] blood cultures MRSA from
[**1-4**] and 3/4 [**1-5**]. CT chest showed multiple lung nodules and
paracentesis was negative for SBP. ID was consulted regarding
high-grade bacteremia and possibility of endocarditis. A TTE
demonstrated a large, friable thrombus in the RA and SVC,
prolapsing into the RV on diastole. Initial CT of the chest
demonstrated multiple pulmonary nodules, which were concerning
for septic emboli given the high-grade bacteremia and evidence
of septic thrombophlebitis. Heparin gtt was started for goal PTT
60-80. Pressors were weaned slightly over the days and repeat
TTE on [**1-9**] demonstrated similar clot burden. Interventional and
CT surgery were both consulted regarding possibility of
intervention; however given her clinical instability, the
decision was made to continue with medical management at this
time. Repeat TTE on [**1-12**] showed a decreased size in the thrombus
but with new adherence to the tricus
