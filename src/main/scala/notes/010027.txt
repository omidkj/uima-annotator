History of Present Illness:
89 y/o F chinese-speaking female with severe diastolic heart
failure, atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation, diabetes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with worsening DOE/SOB
for past 3 days. Patient was seen for worsening dyspnea and
shortness of breath by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in heart failure clinic [**2154-8-26**]
and at that time the patient's was started on lasix 20mg daily
and increased toprol dose. Per family, patient's lower extremity
edema improved, but dyspnea persisted. Also intermittant CP,
lasts >5min, occurring several times a day, no current pain and
no pain in ED.
.
In ED, Temp 97.5, HR 75 BP 123/91 RR 26 Pox 98 on 3 LNC. CXR
showed retrocardiac opacity and new bilateral pleural effusions.
No n/v, abd pain, f/c, cough, chest pain. In ED, he received
Levofloxacin 750 mg iv, and nitro SL. She initially had some
relief with better dyspnea after getting nitro. Got 250 ml bolus
and then had respiratory distress and was intuabted. Lactate

======================
IMAGING:
TEE: [**9-9**]: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The right
atrial appendage ejection velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
LV systolic function appears depressed. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta to
47cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA/RA/RAA. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild
aortic regurgitation.
.
TTE [**7-16**]: The atria are moderately dilated. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free
wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal
with normal free wall contractility. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-5-25**],
pulmonary pressures are higher. The other findings are simlar.
.
CXR [**2154-9-7**]:  Cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, which appear new from the
prior study. The aorta remains tortuous with mural
calcifications present. Pulmonary ascularity is normal. The
osseous structures are unchanged. A retrocardiac opacity is
nonspecific, which may represent atelectasis, but infection is
excluded.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Retrocardiac opacity, which could represent atelectasis, but
infection  not excluded.
3. No evidence of pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
89F c diastolic dysfunction with worsening heart failure, atrial
fibrillation not on anticoagulation and mod-severe MR+TR who
presents with acute on chronic worsening of dyspnea.
.
# Dyspnea / Respiratory Failure: Differential diagnosis includes
CHF vs PNA vs MI. Given rapid decompensation with small fluid
bolus, and history of lack of fever, cough, no wbc,
non-impressive CXR, the most likely cause of her dyspnea was
acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, likely worsened
recently by afib. MI was ruled out with unremarkable EKG and
negative cardiac e
