REPEAT OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION

EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, pureed consistency barium, and one cookie coated with
barium were administered. Results follow:

ORAL PHASE:
The oral phase was noted for overall mild deficits with regards
to decreased bolus control and formation, prolonged mastication,
decreased ap tongue movement with pumping behavior, mildly
prolonged oral transit with solids & liquids, and mild oral
residue remaining on the tongue. There was also intermittent
trace premature spillover of thin liquids to the laryngeal
vestibule with thin liquids.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE:
The pharyngeal phase [**Month/Day/Year 3780**] significant improvment from
the
prior exam, as the pt is now demonstrating mild pharyngeal
deficits overall. Hyolaryngeal excursion, laryngeal valve
closure
were both mildly reduced, though epiglottic deflection was
generally incomplete/absence which resulted in a moderate amount
of vallecular residue (solids/purees were greater than liquids).
Bolus propulsion was mildly weakened with mild pyriform sinus
residue noted, mainly with liquids.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION:
Mild penetration occurred during the swallow with thin liquids
due to decreased laryngeal valve closure and also at times
premature spillover. Penetration occurred more with straw sips,
in comparison to cup sips. However, with cued throat clears, the
pt could clear penetration both with straw and cup sips.

No aspiration occurred during the study.

TREATMENT TECHNIQUES:
While the pt was not sensate to either presence of resiude in
his
throat or to penetration that was occurring, the use of repeat
swallows, alternating bites/sips and throat clearing removed
pharyngeal residue and penetration.

SUMMARY:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8484**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] a significant improvement since the last
study. However, he still continues to present with a mild
oropharyngeal dysphagia with the main issues being slowed
mastication, the presence of pharyngeal residue and penetration
with thin liquids. The use of strategies was beneficial at
clearing residue and penetration however, and the pt
demonstrates
good cognitive ability to carryover strategies, even if he has
impaired sensation.
As such, at this time, I would recommend that the pt begin a po
diet consitency of ground consistency solids and thin liquids.
Given the presence of residue remaining in the valleculae with
solids, the 13 mm barium tablet was not administered out of
concern that it could lodge in his valleculae. Therefore, at
this
time, I would recommend that po meds be administered crushed or
in liquid form. Lastly, discussed with MD that given recent lack
of nutrition, team may wish to consider continuing NG tube
feedings for ~24 hrs more, and then d/c tube. Po diet can begin
today however.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Po diet consistency of ground solids, thin liquids. PO meds
crushed or in liquid form.
2. Aspiration precautions, including:
a.  Sit upright at meals.
b.  Swallow 2 times after each bite.
c.  For every sip, swallow-clear your throat - swallow again.
d.  No straws.
e.  Take a sip after each bite.
3. Follow up speech therapy at rehab for dysphagia, diet
advancement.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurse
and
the medical team.

[**2156-12-24**] 3:57 PM

INDICATION: Dobbhoff tube placement.

A feeding tube is in place, terminating within the right lower
lobe bronchus. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or
pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.
There has been interval improvement in bilateral lower lobe
areas of consolidation, and small bilateral pleural effusions
also appear improved in the interval.

IMPRESSION: Malpositioning of feeding tube within the airway as
described. Findings communicated by telephone to Dr. [**Known lastname 8484**] on
the date of the study.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2156-12-23**] 2:36 PM

COMPARISON: Comparison was made to the prior CT scan dated
[**2153-12-28**].

FINDINGS: Study is somewhat limited due to motion artifact, and
also the present study does not include the left dome of the
diaphragm. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable. Note is made
of surgical staples in the left upper quadrant. No free air is
identified in the visualized portion of the abdomen.

IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited study with motion artifact.
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE

REASON: Bruit and TIA.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries. On the left, significant plaque with calcification is
identified.

On the right, peak systolic velocities are 67, 55, 108 in the
ICA, CCA, ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.2. This is
consistent with no stenosis.

On the left, peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid over
the diastolic velocity is 499/152. In the remainder of the
vessel, the peak systolic velocities are 78, 165 in the CCA, ECA
respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 6.3. This is consistent
with an 80-99% stenosis.

There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
