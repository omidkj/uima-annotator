Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, worsening chest CT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20858**] is a 57 y/o F with PMHx of CLL s/p MUD allo
transplant in [**2-27**] and relapse in [**10-27**] now s/p REPOCH, RESHAP
(ANC 103) recently treated with bendamustine and rituximab
[**12-28**], who initially presented from clinic 7 days prior with
worsening of her cough, hypoxia and known infiltrates on chest
CT (RSV, fungal, polymicrobial PNA [**2130-1-20**]) and is now
being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for worsening hypoxia. Last admission
([**Date range (1) 93703**]), she was diagnosed with RSV and treated with IVIG.
During a prior admission [**1-25**], she had a CT scan
suggestive of fungal pneumonia with positive beta glucan and had
BAL [**2130-1-26**] which grew Moraxella, MSSA, and Enterobacter treated
with 21 day course of levofloxacin and started on voriconazole
which was continued until this admission.

In clinic initially, oxygen saturation was 91% on room air and
she complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum and
associated rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. She denies any
fever/chills, decreased po intake, n/v/d, abdominal pain, or
chest pain.

On the floor, patient underwent BAL [**2130-2-24**] which is negative
thus far except for positive RSV. She received Pavilizumab for
RSV and vori was initially changed to posaconazole then ambisome
(first dose [**2130-2-28**]). Repeat chest CT [**2130-2-27**] revealed progression
of bronchogenic infiltrates compared with [**2130-2-22**]. Dermatology
was also consulted for evaluation of rash.

This am, patient had initially been satting high 90s on 2L but
then progressively required more oxygen throughout the day
(93-94% on 7 L face mask with ABG prior to transfer 7.54/35/72
with lactate 1.4).

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient is asymptomatic other than
mild cough and DOE. Denies SOB at rest. Also notes stable
symmetric LE edema. Denies SOB, CP, abdominal pain, rash, N/V/D,
dysuria, headache.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 20858**] was admitted to the BMT service for worsening chest
CT likely secondary to worsening polymicrobial infection. She
continued to worsen on the BMT service with progressive hypoxia
and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management. She was
continued on Ambisome for fungal pneumonia, bactrim for
stenotrophomonas although may be colonizer, Vancomycin and
cefepime for bacterial HAP. She continued to decline and became
increasingly hypoxic. Diuresis was attempted with no improvement
of her hypoxia. Her decline was thought to be secondary to her
neutropenia. Multiple goals of care discussions were held and
the pt was made aware of her poor prognosis, particularly if she
ended up on a ventilator. She still preferred to be intubated
for respiratory failure. She was eventually intubated, despite
her family's wishes of her not to undergo intubation given the
poor likelihood of a good outcome. The family then asked for the
pt to be extubated as they did not want her to suffer. However,
we could not terminally extubate given the patient's expressed
wishes for intubation over several conversations over the past
several days. Under the auspice of the patient's oncologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 410**], the compromise was not to escalate care (ie add a third
pressor, or rescucitate) given its medical futility. The pt
continued to decline and developed ARDS and sepsis. Was started
on pressors, eventually maxed out on 2 pressors and continued to
worsen. Her severe thrombocytopenia persisted, and she developed
oliguric renal failure secondary to shock and began to develop
severe multiorgan system failure. She died on [**2130-3-10**] at 0830.
Her family was notified and they declined an autopsy.
