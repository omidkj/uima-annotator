Chief Complaint:
Transferred from OSH for Trach + PEG
MICU Transfer: Pneumonia on vent

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-tracheostomy
-G-tube placement
-right thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
68F h/o 02-dependent COPD, chronic hypercapneia, s/p mult admits
in last 6mo's COPD exacerbations, though never intubated until
current admission, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for trach and
PEG on [**2123-12-22**].  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt spiked fever to 103.
Workup of the fever revealed severe RLL as well as large,
loculated R pl. effusion (see full report below).  Trach and PEG
postponed to treat these issues.  Pt being transferred to MICU
service for management and tx of PNA.
.
Relevant recent hx includes admission to [**Hospital6 **] on
[**2123-12-12**] w/ hypercarbic resp failure & MS changes.  Admission
ABG on [**2123-12-12**] was 7.13/>115/64 on [**1-5**] of BiPAP.  She was
treated w/ IV steroids, abx, and lasix.  She was thought to have
COPD exacerbation & PNA, as well as possible CHF exacerbation.
Pt failed BiPAP & required intubation.  A triple lumen R-IJ was
placed on [**2123-12-14**] in the setting of hypotension: she reportedly
had SBP into the 80s & required pressors for a short
period--dopamine initially (which made her tachycardic) then
vasopressin.  Cause for her hypotension is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] sputum
from [**12-13**] grew pseudomonas (sensitive to gent, tobra, cefepime,
imipenem, and zosyn).  Because of this cx data, her abx were
changed from levoflox to cefepime.  Bld cx's there were w/o
growth.  Pt was started on TF via NGT.
.
Despite tx, pt was unable to be weaned off of vent.  ABG on
[**2123-12-21**] was 7.36/83/78 on AC [**1-5**], TV 450, Fi02 45%.  Given
overall picture, pt evaluated for trach & PEG at OSH; however,
it was felt that she would be high risk for procedure given her
kyphosis & body habitus, so she was transferred here for
intervention.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was con't on cefepime for tx of PNA as
well as IV steroids & nebs for COPD and dilt gtt for rapid afib.
 The day following admission, [**2123-12-22**], WBC 20 (up from 15 day
prior) and pt febrile to 103.  She was started on vanc in
addition to cefepime.  She underwent chest CT which showed PNA
w/ large, complex effusion.  Additionally, CT showed possible
filling defect in pulm artery, for which CTA was recommended to
further eval.  However, b/c of pt's allergy to iodine, she did
not undergo CTA.
Pt underwent flex bronch on [**12-23**], which showed small white
exophytic playw in RML (likely aspirated food).  Biopy x2 of RML
orifice and BAL of LLL performed.  PPD performed--result
pending.
.
Pt currently c/o dyspnea--stable since admission.  She has had
moderate amount of secretions.  Her afib has improved w/ regard
to rate control.  She was transitioned off dilt gtt and
controlled with dilt PO.
.
ROS: Pt notes no pain, including CP.  Fever y'day.  Feels
"scared" about all that is going on medically.  This is her
first time being intubated.  She feels like she needs lasix.  No
LE swelling, She notes that she only has diabetes while on
steroids.

Past Medical History:
-COPD 02 dependent, chronic hypercapnia, never intubated prior
to current admission
-mild CHF-->LVED 40-45% on OSH echo
-mild pulm HTN w/ PA pressure of 35mmhg by OSH echo

-[**Name (NI) 15764**]>pt reports this is only present while on steroids
-kyphosis
-PVD w/ LE ulcers

Brief Hospital Course:
68F h/o severe COPD, vent-dependent, planned for trach & PEG on
admission deferred after finding MRSA LLL PNA + B pleural
effusions (L>R), treated with vanc/cefepime, also on heparin gtt
for PE.
.
# MRSA Pneumonia: Pt was found to have LLL pneumonia, initially
considered CAP vs. nosocomial as pt had been transferred from
[**Hospital6 **] after being admitted there from home w/ PNA,
and because pt had been vented for over a week before transfer.
Pt received cefepime for pseudomonal coverage per OSH cultures,
and was started on vancomycin for MRSA in sputum.  She should be
continued on vancomycin and cefepime until [**1-1**].
.
# Respiratory distress: Pt originally intubated at OSH because
of hypercarbic failure related to severe COPD, PNA, and pleural
effusions.  Pt found to have bilateral pleural effusions likely
[**3-5**] chronic process, and possibly related to previous infection
(considered unlikely acute empyema).  Because of PNA, pt
initially continued on vent. A right-sided thoracentesis was
performed on [**2123-12-27**] seeking to drain an effusion; this was
complicated by the development of a pneumothorax which required
the placement of a chest tube. Bedside tracheostomy was
subsequently performed by interventional pulmonology on
[**2123-12-28**].
.
# Pulmonary embolism: CT w/o contrast demonstrated filling
defect in pulmonary artery.  Pt administered heparin gtt and to
r/o possible future PE source, bilateral lower extremity
ultrasounds were obtained and confirmed no DVTs.  Pt's
outpatient mgt will require long-term anticoagulation.
Anticoagulation was held briefly in anticipation of her multple
procedures; warfarin was re-started on [**2123-12-29**].  INR 1.3 on
[**2123-12-30**].
.
# COPD, possible exacerbation: Pt's baseline pulmonary function
marked by severe COPD with hypercarbia & baseline 02
requirement.  Pt was therefore maintained on nebulizers and
guaifenesin, and was started on methylprednisolone (Solumedrol)
IV at 40mg IV q8h, which was tapered to 20mg q8h.  Before [**12-27**]
procedure, pt was maintained on stress-dose steroids. On
[**2123-12-29**], she was transitioned to 15 mg daily of PO prednisone.
This dose may be tapered as follows: 15mg on [**12-31**], 10mg on
[**1-1**], 5mg on [**1-2**], 3mg on [**1-3**] mg on [**1-3**] and then
discontinue.
.
# CHF: Pt uses furosemide 60mg daily as home regimen for
baseline CHF, and was restarted on furosemide 60mg QOD to
maximize respiratory capacity and was increased to 60mg PO
daily.  She should continue on lasix 60mg PO daily.
.
# Type II DM: Per pt, elevated glucose only when steroids used.
Pt was initially placed on insulin gtt, which was then changed
to NPH 30units x1 dose AM after MICU transfer.  NPH was titrated
to control sugars Fs<150, and as of [**12-29**], was 20 units [**Hospital1 **].
This may require adjustment as steroids are tapered and
eventually discontinued.
.
# AFib:  Patient was rate-controlled initially on diltiazem gtt
and later on diltiazem PO. Anticoagulation was held in the
setting of surgial procedures but restarted on [**2123-12-29**].
Continue warfarin and titrate to INR 2.0-3.0.
.
# Nutrition: Nutrition was consulted and recommended tube feeds
as follows: Half strength Nutren 2.0 at 50ml/hour with
