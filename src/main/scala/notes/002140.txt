Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-4-18**] Mitral Valve Replacement w/ 25/33 On-X valve, MAZE
procedure, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] ligation

History of Present Illness:
56 y/o female with h/o DM, HTN and MVP who presented to OSH with
acute shortness of breath. She underwent an echo which revealed
a flail mitral valve secondary to torn chordae and an EF of 60%.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical management. Also
during this she developed new onset Atrial Fibrillation.

Depression

Neck: Supple, FROM, -JVD, -carotid bruits
CV: 90 Irreg with holosystolic murmur
Pulm: CTAB
ABD: Soft, NT/ND +BS
Ext: w/d -c/c/e, -varicosities, 2+ pulses throughout
Neuro: MAE, non-focal, A&O x 3

Pertinent Results:
[**4-17**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed no significant flow-limiting disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were all widely patent with only
mild luminal irregularities. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed
mildly elevated right and left heart filling pressures with a
mean RA of 8mmHg and mean PCWP of 18mmHg. The PASP was 34mmHg.
The cardiac index was low-normal at 2.2l/min/m2. 3. Left
ventriculography revealed a calculated LVEF of 71% with no
regional mall motion abnormalities. There was severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation.
[**4-18**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic(EF>75%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The anterior mitral valve leaflet has at least two flail
segments. Chordae can be seen in the left atrium intermittently.
There is at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation. There is
likely more mitral regurgitation present but the jet is
eccentric and posteriorly directed. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. A small secundum atrial septal
defect is present with a left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. POST-BYPASS: Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic
function. Left ventricular ejection fraction is about 55%-60%. A
[**Hospital1 **]-leaflet mechanical prosthetic valve is seated in the mitral
position. There is trace to mild mitral regurgitation which is
normal for this prosthesis. No perivalvular leak is seen but
image quality prevents complete exclusion. Mean gradient across
the mitral valve is 2.6 mm Hg. No evidence of aortic dissection
post de-canulation. The rest of the exam is unchanged from
pre-bypass.
[**4-24**] CXR: Since most recent radiograph, there appears to be
improved aeration to the lower lobes bilaterally with decreased
atelectasis within the retrocardiac region. A small layering
left-sided pleural effusion persists with no appreciable
right-sided effusion identified. A small branching linear
opacity projecting over the right mid hemithorax likely
represents a small area of subsegmental atelectasis and there is
otherwise unchanged appearance to cardiomegaly in this patient
noted to be status post median sternotomy and mitral valve
repair. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**4-16**] from OSH in CHF for cath which was done on [**4-17**].
This revealed 4+ MR, and normal coronaries, EF 70%. Underwent
MVR ( mechanical)/Maze/ligation of left atrial appendage on [**4-18**]
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition
on propofol, insulin, and phenylephrine drips. Extubated that
evening and transferred to the floor on POD #1 to begin
increasing his activity level. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
also removed and coumadin started that evening. Heparin also
started until INR was therapeutic.[**Last Name (un) **] consult obtained for
management of diarrhea since starting metformin. INR 2.9 on POD
#7 and heparin DCed. Cleared for discharge to home with VNA
services on [**4-25**]. Pt. is to make all follow-up appts. as per
discharge instructions. Target INR is 3.0-3.5 for ONYX
mechanical valve. First blood draw [**4-27**] with results to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3321**] for coumadin dosing/management.
