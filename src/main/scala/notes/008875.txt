Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 55627**] was admitted on [**2184-10-11**].  He proceeded to the OR
and underwent a redo MVR with a 29mm mosiac porcine heart valve
via right thoracotomy.  Total cardio-pulmonary bypass time was
85 minutes.  There was no cross clamp time as this operation was
done with a bleeding heart approach.
He was tranferred to the ICU in NSR rate 98, MAP 62, CVP 8, on
neosynephrine, milrinone, insulin, and propofol drips.

He was extubated on the evening of his operative day without any
complications.  His IV medications were weaned and both the
milrinone and the neosynephrine being discontinued on the AM of
POD 2.

He had some post-op tachycardia for which is lopressor dose was
increased and ace inhibitor adjusted.  He was also followed by
the cradiology team and their recommendations were followed.

His chest tubes remained in longer than is typical because of
ongoing drainage.  On POD 3 he was noted to have crepitus in his
right check and upper chest.  His chest tubes x 3 remained on
suction with an air leak. On [**10-18**] (POD 7) the chest tubes were
put to water seal with a subsequent CXR showing a small
pneumthorax and they were again put to suction.  A persistent
pneumothorax remined and on [**10-21**] (POD 9) a thoracic consult was
obtained with rcommendations for doxycycline sclerosis.  The
chest tube was eft to water seal with an ongoing leak but
minimal drainage.  The chest tube was clamped for a 24-hour
period  without any respiratory distress and was eventually
discontinued on [**10-26**] (POD 15) per the recommendations of the
thoracic surgery team.

Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 55628**] was followed by the physical therapy team
throughout his hospital stay with initial evaluation on POD 2
and on POD 7 he was found to be for for home.

On [**10-27**] POD he was found to be safe for discharge home.
