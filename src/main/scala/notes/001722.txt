Date of Birth:   [**2075-4-19**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old man
admitted to the Coronary Care Unit after four left anterior
descending artery stents were placed for an acute
anterolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

The patient has a history of hypertension and a family
history of coronary artery disease.  No known history of
personal coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, or
diabetes mellitus.

He was washing his bus today when he noted the onset of
severe left-sided chest pain (like "knives"), diaphoresis,
and nausea.  He was taken by Emergency Medical Service to
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital in [**Location (un) **] where an acute
anterolateral myocardial infarction was noted on the
electrocardiogram.  He received aspirin, nitroglycerin,
heparin, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for percutaneous coronary intervention.

In the Catheterization Laboratory, the patient had an
Angio-Jet of a complete mid left anterior descending artery
lesion and four stents placed.  He was briefly hypotensive
during the procedure and was given dopamine until an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  He was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit stable off of dopamine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Multiple sclerosis (Symptoms include dysarthria and left
leg weakness worse with exertion.  The patient has just
completed a 6-month regimen of chemotherapy and steroids;
alternating months).
3.  Possible nephrotic syndrome (lower extremity edema,
protein in urine).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included
lisinopril b.i.d., tizanidine, Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
albuterol, and famotidine.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location **] with his wife and four
children.  He drives a [**Hospital1 **] bus.  He has no history of
smoking or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history positive for coronary artery
disease; his sister was deceased at the age of 58, status
post coronary artery bypass graft times three.  His mother
had coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination upon
admission revealed vital signs were stable and unremarkable.
He had no carotid bruits.  His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His heart was regular in rate and
rhythm with soft heart sounds.  His abdomen was benign.  His
right groin catheter site was soft and without hematomas or
bruits.  He had dorsalis pedis pulses present bilaterally.
His neurologic examination revealed alert and mentating well
with dysarthria.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission revealed white blood cell count was 14.6,
hematocrit was 37, platelets were 263.  INR was 1.3, PTT was
98.2.  Sodium was 139, potassium was 4,  chloride was 103,
bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 25, creatinine
was 0.8, and blood glucose was 133.  Calcium was 9.6.  His
first creatine kinase was 300.  His blood gas was
7.41/38/302.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram prior to
catheterization demonstrated a sinus rhythm at the rate of
88, normal axis and normal intervals.  ST elevations in I,
aVL, V2 through V5.  ST depressions in III and aVF.

Catheterization results with pressures which revealed right
atrial pressure mean of 9 mmHg, pulmonary artery was 42/21,
right ventricular was 50/5.  Arteries revealed left anterior
descending artery with diffuse 30% proximal lesion, 100% mid
lesion, 90% origin first diagonal lesion.  The left
circumflex with diffuse 30% ostial/proximal 40% mid, 70% left
posterior descending artery.  The right coronary artery with
mild luminal irregularities.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Coronaries:  As above, the
patient had 2-vessel coronary artery disease and had four
stents placed in his left anterior descending artery.  He was
enrolled in the Cool-MI trial.

The patient was treated with aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor,
captopril, and metoprolol status post myocardial infarction.
His peak creatine kinase was 7436 with a MB fraction of 830.
The creatine kinases after this trended downward.  After his
intervention, the patient did not have any evidence of
ischemia by symptoms or by electrocardiogram.

(b)  Pump:  The patient was maintained on an intra-aortic
balloon pump for one day following his percutaneous coronary
intervention.  The balloon pump was weaned without event.

He had an echocardiogram on day three status post myocardial
infarction which revealed an left ventricular ejection
fraction of 25% to 30%, with severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction; comprising septal, anterior, and apical
akinesis.  The patient was placed on heparin for this
akinesis; which was converted to warfarin prior to discharge.

(c)  Rhythm:  The patient had multiple runs of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia after his myocardial infarction.  The
longest run consisted of 15 beats to 20 beats and occurred
within 48 hours of his infarction.  He had several shorter
runs of 5 beats to 10 beats occurring more than two days
status post myocardial infarction.

The Electrophysiology Service was consulted regarding
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.  They
elected to see the patient in one month when his course of
Plavix was completed and he was at less of a risk of
bleeding.  He was to have a T wave alternans study at this
time and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] of the
Electrophysiology Service.

2.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient oxygenated well throughout
his admission and did not have pulmonary problems.

3.  RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient's creatinine remained stable
at a level under 1 throughout his admission.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a drop in his hematocrit
from 37 to 31.4 after his catheterization.  His hematocrit
remained stable around 30 to 31 after that initial drop, and
he did not receive any blood transfusions.

5.  ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient was noted to have multiple
fasting blood sugars of greater than 126 during this
admission.  He had a hemoglobin A1c that was in the upper
limits of normal range.  He was to follow up with his primary
care physician for further diagnosis and management of
possible type 2 diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
2.  Status post left anterior descending artery stents.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was fair.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
2.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Metoprolol-XL 150 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. (times one month).
7.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with the Cardiology Clinic
at [**Hospital1 69**] in one to two weeks.
2.  The patient was to follow up with Electrophysiology in
three to four weeks.
3.  The patient was to follow up with primary care physician
in one to two weeks.
