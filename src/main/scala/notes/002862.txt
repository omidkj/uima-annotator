Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis
Dynamic l.hip screw placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old F h/o HCV cirrhosis, esophageal varices,
h/o falls, initially p/w encephalopathy and hip pain, now s/p
dynamic hip screw to L hip with difficulty extubating post op
requiring transfer to the MICU. Of note pt admitted [**Date range (1) 7136**]
s/p mechanical fall with L 5th digit fx. Pain noted in left hip
at the time but plain films negative. Pt d/c'd to [**Hospital 7137**].
.
She was readmitted on [**11-18**] after being noted to have fever to
100 at CH in association with abd pain. Pt noted to be
encephalopathic, which cleared with lactulose. Pt's fever
attibuted to pna (? right-sided consolidation) and treated with
levo (increased from home sbp dose)/flagyl. Once pt's mental
status more lucid, she was complaining of L hip pain. MRI
showing left intertrochanteric fracture.
.
On [**11-25**], [**Month/Year (2) **] took pt to OR for DHS. Pre-op CXR [**11-24**] showed
increased effusion on R and increased infiltrate on L. Intra-op,
spiked to 100.9, transiently on neosynephrine. [**Name (NI) **], pt
developed thick, copious secretions felt to preclude extubation.
Pt bronch'd in PACU: sputum cxs ultimately grew out MRSA.
.
Pt transferred to MICU with orthopedics following. Pt treated
initially with vanc/zosyn, narrowed to vanc with above cx
results. PT extubated [**11-26**] at 3 pm. She has been doing well
post-extubation. By report, evaluated by PT and is full weight
bearing, though no note in chart since [**11-25**]. She is transferred
to the medical floor for further evaluation and management.
.
Patient is comfortable on the floor on 3L NC. Without complaints
at this time.


Past Medical History:
-Hepatitis C: genotype 1b; acquired from blood transfusion;
complicated by cirrhosis, splenomegaly, ascites, variceal bleed,
partial portal vein thrombosis. s/p therapeutic tap [**2178-7-12**]
admission
-Diabetes Mellitus 2
-Esophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension s/p banding
after bleed in [**2171**]. Most recent EGD 5/06-2 cords of grade I
varices were seen in the middle third of the esophagus and lower
third of the esophagus non-bleeding and non-amenable to banding.
Also portal gastropathy seen.
-GERD
-HTN
-Asthma
-Depression/anxiety
-history of UTI urosepsis [**12-14**]
-s/p open CCY in [**Country 532**], [**2147**]
-s/p removal of ovary, [**2147**]

Social History:
Patient was admitted from [**Hospital3 2558**]. No EtOH, no tobacco,
no IVDU. Pt is a Holocaust survivor, she was living
independently prior to her last admission and her son was
spending nights with her.

Family History:
Patient was three when her parents were killed in the Holocaust.
Her son denies any health problems.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 97.8 BP 126/50, P 78, Resp 20 98% on 3L
General: Alert, no acute distress, no complaints
HEENT: PERRL, extraocular motions intact, sclera mildly icteric,
dry mucous membranes with some mucosal crusting
Neck: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy
Chest: Decreased breath sounds R base, rhonchorous on L,
difficult to auscultate lower lobes due to positioning
CV: Normal S1/S2, RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
Abd: Soft, nontender, significant distention, hyperactive bowel
sounds
Extr: [**1-13**]+ pitting edema to knees b/l. 2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
L hand in splint, left leg with bruising of medial thigh,
patient propped on pillow for positioning of leg


Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2178-11-18**]): There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
with blunting of the right costophrenic angle. There are
increased interstitial markings bilaterally with areas of
confluent opacities in the right middle lobe and right lower
lobe concerning for asymmetrical pulmonary edema and/or
aspiration. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
The osseous structures and soft tissues are normal.
.
CXR [**12-1**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2178-11-29**],
there is again prominence of interstitial markings consistent
with increased pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the
right base with preservation of pulmonary markings is consistent
with a large pleural effusion. Some underlying atelectatic
change may well be present.
.
The right IJ catheter has been removed. The left PICC line again
extends to the level of the carina.
.
Abdominal US: IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with cirrhosis and
portal hypertension. No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
.
BLE US: IMPRESSION: No DVT, bilateral lower extremities
.
MRI: IMPRESSION:
1. Left intertrochanteric fracture with varus angulation and
marked surrounding muscular and soft tissue hematoma/edema
including a 2.7 x 4.3 x 4.0 cm fluid collection containing
hemorrhage posterior to the proximal left femur and contained
within the gluteus minimus muscle. Marked soft tissue swelling
of the left hip and subcutaneous edema extending
circumferentially around the proximal left thigh.
2. Not mentioned above, there is a focal area of increased
signal on STIR sequence with a ring and arc configuration most
consistent with enchondroma. This is seen distal to the fracture
line.
3. Marked pelvic ascites. Please correlate with patient's
previous medical history.
.
EXAMINATION: Left hip and pelvis.
One view of both hips and the pelvis and four views of the
proximal femur and two views of the distal left femur are
submitted showing a nonhealed nonacute intertrochanteric
fracture of the left femur with only mild superior overriding of
the distal fracture fragment, and no dislocation of the mildly
to moderately degenerated left hip joint. Pelvis is intact.
Distal left femur and knee are normal. There is no knee joint
effusion, and the pelvic ring is intact.
.
IMPRESSION: Study limited by overlying casting material. Mid
shaft fifth proximal phalanx fracture again seen.
.
ECHO: Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
