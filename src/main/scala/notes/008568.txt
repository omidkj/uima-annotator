History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of atrial fibrillation
and not being on Coumadin since admission to this hospital who
was last seen well today at 8.00 am.  Then somebody noticed
after
9.30 am that she was not moving the left side.  Stroke fellow
was
called at 9.58 am for STAT stroke consult.  Stroke fellow was at
the bed side at 10.10 am.  At the time of neurological exam she
was not moving the left side and was looking to the right side.
Order for CT head and CTA was put by the primary team but there
was no CT tech at the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].  CT tech went from [**Hospital Ward Name 12837**]
to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].  Patient was taken to the CT scanner.  Nurse
helpers taking care of the patient started rolling the patient
and reached the elevator but they did not know where is the CT
scanner.  They ran back to the main nursing counter and found
out
that CT scanner is on the [**Location (un) 470**].  They also found out that
due to construction, entrance to the radiology floor may be
blocked.  Patient was first taken to some other floor on Riesman
but then it was found out that it does not lead to anywhere.
Then while inside the elevator patient was taken to the [**Location (un) 13603**] on Riesman  but the entrance to the radiology was blocked.

Patient was then taken to the Main ground floor and help was
asked from the main counter. They informed that Gryzmich
elevator
can lead to radiology but the patient bed was too big for that
elevator.  Patient was then taken out from the bed and was then
put on wheelchair.  She was then taken to the radiology.  By the
time she was on the CT table it was 10.45 am.

HCT [**10-17**]:
1) No hemorrhage or mass effect.
2) Chronic microvascular ischemia and chronic right cerebellar
infarct as detailed above.

CTA [**10-21**]:
CT head demonstrates no evidence of hemorrhage or signs of loss
of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation. CTA of the neck is somewhat
limited due to delayed bolus and also due to reflux in the
vascular structures with particular limited evaluation of the
left carotid and vertebral arteries. Intracranial CTA
demonstrates possible thrombosis in the junction of the M1 and
M2 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. The patient
subsequently was taken to the angiography suite for further
evaluation with cerebral angiog
