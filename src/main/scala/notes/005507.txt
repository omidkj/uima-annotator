woman, with neck pain and C1 on C2 instability, with grade 2
anterolisthesis, who had a C2 fracture with gait disturbance.
The patient has been in a hard collar since [**2180-3-3**]. She
is admitted for occipitocervical fusion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD. The patient had a PTCA in [**2174**] at
[**Hospital1 2025**]. Dyspnea secondary to COPD and emphysema. The patient had
an echo in [**2175-2-1**] with an EF of 55%, 1+ mitral
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Diltiazem 90 mg once daily.
2. Ditropan XL 10 mg.
3. Serevent diskus 2 b.i.d.

9. Multivitamin 1 p.o. once daily.
10.      Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d.
The patient was on Ecotrin and Celebrex which was
discontinued.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Tonsillectomy, appendectomy,
hysterectomy, cataract surgery and right CEA.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is an elderly woman in no acute distress
in a hard collar. The patient is somewhat forgetful but
pleasant. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS:
Clear to auscultation. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, positive
bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. The patient has a
longstanding history of urinary frequency and constipation.
Her strength in her upper extremities is [**4-6**] bilaterally.
Lower strength is [**4-6**].

Her MRI shows no overt cord compression or signal
abnormality. However, on x-rays there is gross C1 on C2
instability.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted status post
occiput to C3 fusion without intraoperative complication.
Postoperatively, her vital signs were stable. She was
monitored in the recovery room. Her strength was [**4-6**] in all
muscle groups. Her sensation was intact to light touch. She
was in a hard collar. She was extubated in the recovery room.
She was kept on q 1 h. neuro checks. Her SBP was kept at less
than 150.

On postoperative day 1, her incision was clean and dry, and
her strength continued to be [**4-6**] in all muscle groups. She
was in a hard collar. She was out-of-bed ambulating. She was
in for a PT and OT evaluation, and continued to be ruled out
for an MI. On her postoperative EKG, she had ST depression
with also elevated CPKs into the 500 range. ST depression was
laterally without chest pain. She was treated with IV
Lopressor and Lasix. She was transferred to the CCU for MI
management, and treated with Lopressor and lisinopril for
rate control. She was in the CCU for 2 days and then
transferred back to the regular floor. The patient was
started on aspirin and continued on Lopressor for rate
control. She was transferred to the regular floor on [**2180-4-26**]. She also had an x-ray on [**4-24**]. She had a bedside
swallow evaluation which she failed with thin liquids. She
was not even able to tolerate 2 tsp of liquid without
coughing. She was kept n.p.o., and they felt that she should
just be reevaluated in a couple of days when some of her
swelling from surgery subsided.

She was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy,
and felt to require a short rehab stay. She did have a couple
of bouts of short runs of V-tach. Her electrolytes were
stable. She will require continued cardiology follow-up, and
will require a catheterization as an outpatient. About 2
weeks after discharge is when she can be safely catheterized
and anticoagulated per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**], the neurosurgeon. Her hard
collar was removed, and a video swallow was repeated on [**4-26**], and she again failed with thin liquids, and she continues
to have a Dobbhoff feeding tube in for nutrition. She will
need to have a video swallow or bedside swallow repeated in 1
week. If she passes at bedside, she may need a video swallow
to assure there is no aspiration. Neurologically, she
remained stable. Cardiovascular stable. Vital signs are
stable.
