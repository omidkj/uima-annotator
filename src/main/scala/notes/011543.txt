Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Left-sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of ventriculostomy drain
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
History obtained from daughter and medical records

The pt is a 75 year-old man with a history of HTN, atrial
fibrrillation on coumadin, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD, and CRI who presented from
home with left-sided weakness.

The pt's daughter reports that she was at parent's house until
about 10pm
on the evening of admission. Pt was at his baseline, and having
no problems. Daughter went home (across the street) and was
called by her mother ~5 minutes later that pt had fallen to
floor. She returned to their house and found pt on floor, unable
to get up. She tried to help him, but he "was dead weight" and
he said he was having trouble moving his legs (both of them). He
said that he "didn't feel well" and daughter noticed that he
seemed to have trouble
breathing. She also noticed that he was pale, was leaning to the
left and was drooling. She called 911. After their arrival, pt
developed "projectile vomiting". Per EMS, he also had vomiting
in ambulance and may have aspirated.

On arrival in ED, SBP 200s, and pt seemed somewhat sleepy and
inattentive. He complained of pain in his stomach and "feeling
lousy." Denied headache. He had no gag reflex, and was intubated
for airway protection with lidocaine, vecuronium, fentanyl,
succinylcholine, and etomidate.

The pt's daughter reported no recent illnesses. Unable to obtain
other ROS due to intubation.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Atrial fibrillation on coumadin, previously on amiodarone
3. CAD, s/p CABG x4 "years ago"
4. DM2, complicated by peripheral neuropathy in his feet
5. COPD and bronchiectasis
6. Hypercholesterolemia
7. Congestive heart failure
8. Peripheral vascular disease
9. Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creat 1.7-2.2
10. Hypothyroidism secondary to amiodarone
11. s/p cholecystectomy

Social History:
The pt lives with wife who is "sick" per daughter. Quit tobacco
in [**2164**], has >100 pack-yr history. No alcohol use.

The pt's father suffered an MI at age 60.

before intubation. Followed axial commands.

light, 4 to 3.5 mm bilaterally. Unable to visualize fundi due to
 roving eye movements. Extraocular movements roving, and do
cross  midline. No gag reflex.

fingers and toes but does not hold up left arm or leg against
gravity

CT head on admission:

FINDINGS: There is extensive intraventricular hemorrhage seen in
the lateral ventricles extending through the third ventricle
into the fourth ventricle. Hydrocephalus is seen. Right lateral
ventricle is larger than the left, measuring 3 cm in width.
Areas of low attenuation are seen in the periventricular white
matter of both cerebral hemispheres, and linear low density
areas in the cerebellar hemispheres, likely representing chronic
microvascular infarction. There is no evidence of brain
herniation. There is no evidence of acute infarction. There is
no shift of normally midline structures. There is probable
moderate brain atrophy. The surrounding soft- tissue and osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage along with
hydrocephalus.

CT head [**2174-8-3**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: The right intraparenchymal hemorrhage is
again visualized; it appears to arise from the right thalamus.
It is not significantly changed in size or appearance. Again
seen is associated edema in the right cerebral hemisphere. There
is now layering intraventricular blood in the lateral, third,
and fourth ventricles. There is interval development of a small
(2 mm wide) low density fluid collection along the left frontal
and parietal cerebral convexity surface. No new regions of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage are identified. There is no acute
major vascular territorial infarct. Osseous and soft tissues
structures are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of small (2 mm) left cerebral
convexity subdural fluid collection, likely a hygroma.
Otherwise, no significant interval change in extensive
intraventricular and right thalamic hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Right basal ganglia hemorrhage: The CT scan on admsission
demonstrated a large basal ganglia bleed on the right side with
significant intraventricular extension.  Shortly after
admission, a ventriculostomy drain was placed by the
neurosurgery service.  tPA was injected into the drain in an
attempt to dissolve the intraventricular clot.  A head CT was
performed on hospital day two which revealed increase in size in
the area of bleed and intraventricular extension.  The pt's
mental status waxed and waned over the cousre of the first four
hospital days.  Although he never opened his eyes to command or
to pain, he would intermittently grasp an examiner's hand on
command.  The ventricular pressure was titrated by the
neurosurgery service in an attempt to wean and remove the drain.
 However, the pt. did not tolerate this well when the drain was
placed above 10cm of H2O.  By the time of hospital day six, the
pt. stopped following any commands and began to clinically
deteriorate.  A family meeting was held on hospital day 7 with
the pt's daughter, [**Name (NI) 41356**], the pt's sister and [**Name2 (NI) 802**], and
members of the neurology, neurosurgery and intensive care unit
teams.  At that time, the decision was made to withdraw support,
extubate the pt and shift the goals of care to comfort measures.
Shortly after extubation, the pt passed away with family members
at his bedside.
