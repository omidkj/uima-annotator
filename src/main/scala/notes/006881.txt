HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old
female with diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia admitted to
outside hospital for COPD flareup.  The patient initially did
well with nebulizers, but on [**8-12**] became acutely short of
breath with ABG of 7.13 and was intubated.  The patient had
been started on doxycycline for right lower lobe infiltrate
and then started on IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  CTA was
negative for PE.  EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation and
concern regarding biphasic T waves.  The patient was started
on IV hydration and nitroglycerin.  The patient was ruled out
for MI by negative enzymes.  The patient with episodes RAF,
PAT, ST, heart rate of 130.  Treated with IV Lopressor and
Cardizem.  Echo on [**8-12**] demonstrated mildly depressed LV
function with an ejection fraction of 55 percent.  Aortic
stenosis valve area 0.6, mean gradient 25, peak gradient 50.
BMP was moderately elevated at the outside hospital.  The
patient was transferred for COPD exacerbation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dyslipidemia,, hypertension, RA,
diabetes type 2, COPD, osteoporosis.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine, quinolones.

MEDICATIONS:  Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, albuterol, Atrovent,
Solu-Medrol, RISS, aspirin, Norvasc, Singular, heparin,
Flovent.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 96, 145/53, 57 on assist
control 600, 14, 0.5, CVP 20, PAP 40/30, 33 to 15 now.  In
general, sedated and intubated.  HEENT right pupil surgical.
Left was reactive to light.  Chest bibasilar crackles.  CV
irregular, [**2-4**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Abdomen
soft, nondistended, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities 1+ edema bilaterally.  Lines right Swan IJ.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission d-dimer was greater than 1000.
Hematocrit 30.7.  EKG showed atrial tachycardia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Coronaries.  Coronaries were clean by recent
catheterization.  The patient was on aspirin, but was changed
to Plavix given history of COPD and a reaction to aspirin
causing COPD to flare.  The patient was held on all beta
blockers, given beta agonists for COPD.  However, the patient
was continued on ACE inhibitors.

2.  Myocardium.  Ejection fraction 50 percent.  The patient's
ACE inhibitor was titrated upward and the patient had a Swan
in and volume status was titrated accordingly.

3.  Aortic stenosis.  The patient's valvular disease was
severe, but not critical which was likely contributing to her
CHF.  There were no active issues during that time.

4.  Rhythm.  MAT occasional COPD with enlarged right atrium.
The patient's rate was controlled with diltiazem drip which
was changed to p.o. diltiazem as the patient tolerated.

5.  Pulmonary.  The patient was on the CCU service and at the
end of hospitalization was transferred to the MICU service.
The patient came in with COPD exacerbation, intubated and
sedated.  The patient was started on methylprednisolone,
inhalers and nebs as scheduled.  The patient was then
extubated successfully, however, was transferred to the MICU
because the patient had worsening COPD exacerbation on
steroids and scheduled albuterol and Atrovent q.two hours.
In the MICU the patient's COPD exacerbation continued to
worsen despite maximal therapy with nebulizers and steroids.
MICU intern documented that the patient was changed to
comfort measures only after discussion with the family.  At
that time, three hours later, at 3:51 in the morning, the
patient was found with cease of respirations.  The patient's
likely cause of death was COPD exacerbation.

6.  ID.  The patient had vent acquired pneumonia and was
treated with antibiotics.

7.  Aortic stenosis.  The patient was not a surgical
candidate throughout this hospitalization.

DISPOSITION:  The patient died on the MICU service, cause
being COPD exacerbation.
