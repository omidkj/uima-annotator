Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19836**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
52 year old male, SLE s/p recent admission 6 weeks ago with
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage re pressetns after 3days of
increased weakness, bilateral LEs, cough with increasing
hemoptysis, malaise and confusion. Per wife as pt confused and
giving poor history he had been increasingly weak since Friday
requiring walker which he had not been using, he fell twice, did
not hit his head and was more confused. She also noted that he
has been coughing with increasing amounts of blood in his
sputum. She did not note any fevers, chills or any other
chnages. Patient denies any other apin, CP, pleuritic pain, HAs,
lightheadedness, or dizziness, no dysphagia although losing
weight, appetite the same. No abd pain, no bleeding from
anywhere else.
.
In ED had sats around 88%on RA, but placed on NRB, had CXR with
possible consolidation of LLL vs hemorrhage and CT scan with
consolidation and obstruction of LLL. Started on levaquin and
decadron and IP consulted for bronch.


Past Medical History:
1. FUO -began in [**2195-4-6**] worked up by heme/onc, Rheum, and ID
workup over the past 8 months which has been completely
unrevealing to date. Of note, the patient has negative HIV yet
persistently low CD4 counts (mid100s), distal esophageal
thickening with EGD [**4-8**] completely normal, left
iliac/hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy s/p left iliac LN FNA bx
which was nondiagnostic (exicisonal bx not attempted b/c
location made it unresectable), and no abnormalities on vast
rheumatological workup including [**Doctor First Name **]/RF/ANCA/Temporal Art Bx.
Colonoscopy, liver bx, nad bone marrow bx were all also
negative. The patient has also had a vast imaging workup
including head CT/MRI in [**7-9**] which showed only mild prominence
of SA space over frontal lobes c/w mild frontal cortical
atrophy. Fevers treated with prednisone in past which has caused
worsening mental status.
2. Cholelithiasis
3. Anemia- Workup has included EGD and colonoscopy as well as
bone marrow biopsy all of which were negative.


Social History:
Born and grew up in [**Country 651**], used to work as a tailor before
immigrating to US in [**2177**]. Worked as a cook in a Chinese
restaurant until he became ill in [**2195-4-6**]. Never been a
smoker. Had significant exposure to second hand smoking at work
place. Drank alcohol 10 years ago. Had contact with prostitute
2-3 years ago.


Family History:
non-contributory. no FH of connective tissue or bleeding d/o.
He knows nothing of the health history of family members but
doesn't recall anyone in his family having similar symptoms to
him.

Physical Exam:
T 103.9/ P 109 BP 126/62 RR 20 O2 89-> 94 on 4L -> 98% on NRB
GEN: confused, lethargic, nad
[**Year (4 digits) 4459**] PERRL, MMM, anicteric, clear OP
CV RRR, tachy no murmurs
CHEST CTAB with consolidation of bilateral bases with e to a
changes, coarse BS bilaterally
Abd soft distended, non tender, +BS
EXT no edema, warm and clammy to touch

Pertinent Results:
CXR:  Consolidation involving the left lower lobe and lingula
with
obliteration of the AP window, likely due to lymphadenopathy.
Small left pleural effusion.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right
lower lobe, likely due to consolidations/atelectasis.
.
CTSCAN: Extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with
obstruction of the superior segment of the left lower lobe
bronchus and narrowing of the basal left lower lobe basal
segment bronchi with post-obstructive consolidation/atelectasis
in the left lower lobe  2)  Multifocal areas of alveolar
consolidation/aspiration pneumonia and left upper lobe and right
lung.  Stable small pericardial effusion and small left pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52 yo man with SLE here with 1 week of cough, hemoptysis
and fevers, and 1 month of increased weakness.
.
1.  Hemoptysis
Given hx of DAH with SLE, will bronch to r/o significant
bleeidng currently. Howver with consolitation with LLL bronchial
collapse concern for an obstructibe endo-bronchial lesion.
Started on ceftriaxone/clinda/levaquin for coverage of
CAP/aspiration pneumonia/ and post-obstructive pneumonia.  Also
given high dose steroids and cytoxan treatment concern for
immunucompomised organisms. Cont atovoqoune for now. Anti-GBM
negative and low suspicion for Goodpastures. Has had 3AFB smears
negative in [**7-10**] for TB so less likely. Possible malignancy
given possible endobronchial lesion as well, but await bronch
findings. Consolidation most likey source of fevers, f/u
cultures.
-Cont Vanco/Zosyn/[**Last Name (un) **] due to immunosuppression, recent
admission with concerns for pseudomonas, aytpical, MRSA
pneumonia etc.
-Unclear why continues to have fevers despite triple abx
therapy, as well as IV steroids.  Await bronch results from
today.
-For bronch today - appreciate pulm recs.  Will send for
g.stain, culture, PCP DFA, AFB, [**Name9 (PRE) **], cytology.  Will attempt to
have pulm bx one of LN in lung to r/o lymphoma/CA.
-Satting well on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] titrate 02 as needed to keep sats>93%
-Switched steroids to Dexa 4mg IV q4, will consider back to
prednisone 80mg po qd per Rheum.
-Hct 32.2 now.  Plts, INR nml.
-Hx of negative AFB, low suspicion for TB at this time.  Will
send for AFB off of bronch.
-Bronch revealed oropharyngeal flora, negative g.stain and
culture, neg PCP and AFB, and normal patency of airways, with a
likely diagnosis of Diffuse Alveolar hemorrahge, with no sign of
pneumonia.
-Patient was discharged home on Levaquin to complete a 10 day
course, and all other antibiotics were stopped.
-Rheum and Pulm recommended continuing Prednisone 80mg po qd, to
have follow up in outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic for consideration of
additional Cytoxan if pt can tolerate.
-
.
2. SLE:
-For now will cont steroids and atuvoqoune, although in light of
infection, will follow closely.
-Cont fosamax/calcium/vitamin d and ppi prophylaxis.
-Rheumatology consulted - appreciate recs.  C3 low, C4 nml.
-Consider switching IV dex back to prednisone 80mg po qd per
rheum recs.
-[**Hospital **] normal, no evidence of pericarditis/pericardial effusion
seen.
-Bronch  results showed likely DAH c/w SLE disease, continued on
Pred 80mg po qd, to be discharged with ? additional Cytoxan as
outpatient.

3. Generalized weakness:
Patient describes a generalized weakness in his extremities that
has gradually progressed over the past month to the point that
he uses a walker for ambulation.  Strength appears moderately
intact to exam, although patient with difficulty/fatigue while
standing or walking during exam.  No localizing symptoms on
neuro exam.  DDx includes steroid myopathy vs polymyositis vs
deconditioning.
-CK 31, which makes myositis very unlikely.  Neuro exam nonfocal
and strength fairly well preserved on exam; do not suspect
spinal cord involvement at this time.  Steroid myopathy vs.
generalized deconditioning is favored at this time.
-Pt to continue to have outpatient PT.
.
4. Myocarditis
Currently stable, with no c/o of CP at this time.  Trop neg x1
set today.  CT chest showed small pericardial effusion, no
clincal sign of tamponade present on exam.  Pt did have 20 beat
run of NSVT earlier today of unknown etiology.
-[**Hospital **] report with normal EF 60%, mild symmetric LVH,
physiologic/trivial pericardial effusion seen.  No RV collapse.
No wall motion abnormalities.  Unchanged from 07/[**2196**].
.
5. NSVT
Patient with 20 beat run of polymorphic NSVT while in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Trop, EKG normal when completed.  Lytes checked and were normal.
 Resolved spontaneously, patient completely asymptomatic at the
time.   Patient with no hx of any cardiac disease.   Had
additional 10 and 9 beat runs of NSVT last night - completely
asymptomatic.
-Troponins normal.  [**Hospital Unit Name **] normal as above.
-EP consulted - will follow up on recs.
-Cont metopro
