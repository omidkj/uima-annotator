MICRO:
Urine ([**2-14**]): no growth

EKG ([**2-14**]): Rate 82. Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V block.
Leftward axis. Poor R wave progression. Lateral ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2134-3-27**] first
degree A-V block is now present.

CXR ([**2-14**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal free air.
2. Stable cardiomegaly.
3. No evidence of decompensated congestive heart failure or
pneumonia.

Hand ([**2-16**]) Xray:
PND

EGD [**2-14**]:
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Blood in the stomach body
Dieulafoy lesion in the Anastomotic site (endoclip)
Both the limbs were identified and no source of bleeding was
noticed in those.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
86 yo F h/o HTN, sCHF, bleeding gastric ulcer s/p partial
gastrectomy [**2072**], hematemesis in [**2128**] [**2-3**] anastamotic bleed,
afib not on coumadin p/w nausea and vomiting, hematemesis
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hematemesis/Acute blood loss Anemia:  Patient was initially
admitted to the ICU for frequent episodes of hematemesis with
stable blood pressures and heart rate in the ED.  Initially Hct
was 36 in setting of dehydration and decreased to 26 after fluid
repletion.  GI was consulted and EGD was done on day of
admission which showed likely Dieulafoy's lesion near
anastatmotic site from prior gastric bypass surgery, and three
clips were placed.  Followup Hct was 24 after EGD, transfused 2
