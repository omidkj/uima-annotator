History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 48 year old gentleman with history of DM-I
s/p pancreatic/kidney transplant s/p failed renal allograft, CAD
s/p MI, systolic CHF, PVD s/p femoral angioplasty and distal
extremity debridement who is now transferred from [**Hospital1 **] Care
for concern for hypotension and delerium. The patient has ESRD
presumably [**3-16**] Diabetic Nephropathy and is currenlty maintained
on PD dialysis given previous complications with MRSA Bacteremia
from line sepsis.
Per report, the patient has at baseline low blood pressure with
normal SBP 90-100. He has however had more recently been
hospitalized at [**Hospital 26580**] Hospital in [**Month (only) 958**] for reported infection
of his PD fluid and seizure like activity. The patient was
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] where per report his SBP has been in the
50s to 70s for 3 weeks. Multiple evaluations for infection have
been negative and he has been empirically treated with Ceftaz
and Zyvox. He was empirically treated for adrenal insufficiency
for some time and has now been with altered sensorium and
delerium for 6 days with additional question of seizure like
activity. The patient was seen by Neurology on [**2199-5-17**] given
report of seizures. Recommendation was made to check EEG and CT
and start Keppra 250mg twice daily. CT revealed vascular
calcification but no acute process. Results of EEG are not
available, patient is not on Keppra on transfer.
On evaluation in the ED the patient dropped his BP to 70s but
was fluid responsive to 1L NS with return to SBP 110-120. The
patient had blood cultures obtained and was given a dose of
Vancomycin (had received Zosyn at OSH as well as Dexamethasone).
An attempt at a right central line was unsuccessful. The patient
is now transferred to the ICU for ongoing management.

CXR [**2199-5-19**]: Since the prior study, there appears to have been
removal of a left-sided pacemaker/AICD. The cardiac,
mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged given
differences in technique. The lungs appear clear apart from
minimal linear opacity in the left lower lobe peripherally,
which was likely present on the prior study and may reflect scar
and/or atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
No definite pleural effusions are seen

[**2198-7-25**] Cardiac Cath
1. The LMCA was free of flow limiting disease. The LAD was a
large wrap around vessel and had an 80% stenosis in the mid
segment after the D1 takeoff. The D1 was subtotally occluded.
The Ramus was a relatively small vessel and was also subtotally
occluded. The LCx and OM branches were moderate size vessels.
The major OM had a 60% stenosis. The RCA was a relatively large
vessel with an extensive R-PL system. The RCA was free of flow
limiting disease. The R-PDA and R-PL had 60% stenoses each in
their mid segments.
2. Left ventriculography demonstrated moderate to severe
systolic
dysfunction. There was anterolateral, apical, and inferoapical
akinesis. The calculated EF was 32%. There was no mitral
regurgitation appreciated.
3. Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart
catheterization
demonstrated normal right heart filling pressures and
