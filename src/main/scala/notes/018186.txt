[**2192-1-23**]
ECG- Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. Atrial ectopy. Left axis
deviation.
There is a late transition with tiny R waves in the anterior
leads consistent with possible infarction. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with associated ST-T wave changes, although ischemia
or infarction cannot be excluded. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2193-1-12**] the rate is slightly slower.
.
CHEST XRAY
IMPRESSION: Stable diffuse radiopacities consistent with known
interstitial
lung disease as well as increased pulmonary edema from the prior
examination.


Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION
84F with pulmonary fibrosis, recent GIB, recent submassive PE
anticoagulated p/w fever and cough productive of green sputum
for 3 days.
.
#Cough and fever: Patient was treated with vancomycin, zosyn and
levofloxacin for healthcare associated pneumonia. On hospital
day two she felt better and was oxygenating more avidly. She was
transferred to the medical floor. As a precaution she had been
started on oseltamivir, which was discontinued after her viral
throat swab reulted negative. Legionella urinary antigen was
negative. Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen was negative. Blood
cultures were negative. Beta glucan was pending at the time of
discharge.  The patient continued to improve and was
transitioned to levofloxacin alone of which she completed a 7
day course. At the time of discharge her oxygen requirement was
at baseline and the patient reported symptom improvement.
.
#Elevated lactate: Resolved with fluids. Metformin was initially
held but was restarted at the time of discharge.
.
# Pulmonary Embolus: [**Date Range 263**] 2.8 at rehab on [**2192-1-23**]. Initially she
was continued on lovenox. Her warfarin was then restarted. Her
[**Date Range 263**] was 3.3 at the time of discharge.  coumadin dosing was as
follows
DATE           [**Date Range 263**]            DOSE
[**2193-1-25**]        3.4              0

[**2193-1-28**]        3.3              0
She was discharge on a regimen of 1 mg of coumadin every other
day.  She will follow-u
