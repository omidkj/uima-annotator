Pertinent Results:
R Ankle/Foot X-ray
1. Prominent soft tissue swelling at the first toe amputation
site with a probable small ulceration of the distal soft
tissues. The appearance of the remaining aspect of the first
metatarsal is unchanged, although radiographs have limited
sensitivity for detection of osteomyelitis.
2. Additional postoperative changes of the right foot are
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, DMII, R foot ulcer, s/p recent amputation,
MSSA bacteremia, who presents with fever/hypotension
.
# MSSA Bacteremia: Initially presented with hypotension and SIRS
criteria including fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, was
admitted to the Medical ICU. Hypotension was fluid responsive
after 2.5L NS and he had no evidence of end organ damage. He did
not require pressor support. Given his recent MSSA bacteremia (S
to oxacillin, clinda) and preliminary R hallux wound culture
with GP Cocci, he was treated empirically with vanco/clinda IV.
Blood culture data returned 4/4 bottles positive for methicillin
sensitive staph aureus, and antibiotics were tapered to IV
nafcillin. Suspected source was his R hallux ulcer which also
grew MSSA. This ulcer was debrided by the podiatry service.
Surveilence blood cultures remained negative to date and he has
remained hemodynamically stable; his last positive blood culture
was on [**2109-8-6**].  Oral dicloxacillin was discussed as an
alternative antibiotic, but he will be discharged on a two week
course of nafcillin IV because of his high grade bacteremia and
diabetes (To be continued through [**8-20**]).  He got a
transesophageal echo as an inpatient to rule out endocarditis
given his risk factors, which was negative.
.
# DM type 2: Controlled with sliding scale insulin while
inpatient. Resumed metformin and glyburide.  With rising
creatine, will monitor for hypoglycemia in the setting of being
on glyburide as well as problems with metformin.   Please
consider changing to glipizide if this becomes a problem.
.
# CAD/CHF: s/p CABG in [**2090**]; no signs of active ischemia or
volume overload. Continued on simvastatin, ASA. Metoprolol,
lasix held until HD stable and subsequently re-started.  Will
start lisinopril today prior to discharge for improved mortality
benefit.  Will need a creatinine check 10 days after starting
ACE-I (on [**8-23**]) to ensure that Cr not elevated.  Consider
starting spironolactone if his creatinine remains stable over
next few days.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Initial creat 1.5, baseline
creat 1.2-1.4. Likely pre-renal component. Volume repleted with
IVF's and pRBC and creatinine returned to baseline levels.  On
discharge, he was 1.5.  He should have this checked in one week.
.
# Insomnia/anxiety: The patient had an episode where he crawled
out of bed after receiving Ativan and Ambien.  We stopped both
of these medications and gave him haldol for sleep (2mg) with
good effect.  As a result of this, he has an abrasion of his
right elbow which is superficial in nature, not requiring
stitches.  He also required olanzapine for anxiety.  He should
follow up with his PCP for his chronic anxiety/insomnia
problems.
.
# Atrial fib: Rate controlled, holding coumadin anti-coagulation
in setting of recent GI bleed. Follow-up with cardiology as
outpatient to assess whether or not to restart coumadin given
that patient is a fall risk.
.
# Anemia: Initial hematocrit 26. guaiac negative. Transfused 1
unit pRBC given h/o CAD and PVD with appropriate increase to 29.
 His hematocrit has been stable since.
.
# R foot ulcer: As above, treated with antibiotics and
debridement. Podiatry and Vascular surgery consulted. Vanco
given for MSSA and levo/flagyl empirically at first, switched to
nafcillin prior to discharge.  He needs to follow up with
vascular surgery as an outpatient given his non-healing ulcer
and repeated infections as well as with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3209**] of podiatry for
repacking/resuturing of foot.
.
# Dispo: Patient seen by PT/OT and it was felt that the best
thing for him in terms of rehabilitation is to go to a rehab
center.
