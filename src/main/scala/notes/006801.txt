HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Hospital 98292**] nursing
home patient with past medical history significant for
hypothyroidism, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline
creatinine of 1.6, and hypertension, who was noted to have a
three day history of progressively worsening mental status.
At baseline, the patient is apparently independent in all her
activities of daily livings, ambulates with a walker, and is
appropriately articulate.  In addition, the patient is status
post three falls over the past three days associated with
slurred speech, and increasing confusion.  Patient's falls
were all unwitnessed at the nursing home, but there was no
reported loss of consciousness.

According to nursing home notes, the patient's po intake was
also poor for the past three or four days.  Of note, her
outpatient Lasix dose had been doubled to 40 mg q day on [**7-27**].

On the night prior to admission, patient was noticed to be
increasingly agitated.  As a result, she was given a total of
1 mg of Ativan.  She was then found unresponsive with
systolic blood pressure in the 70s, heart rate in the 50s,
and was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems obtained from the
patient's daughter was remarkable only for a chronic
persistent pruritic dermatitis on the patient's legs and
trunk for the past 2-3 years for which she has been followed
closely by Dermatology.  Of note, the patient is highly
sensitive to various medications with a history of increased
confusion when given drugs like Celexa, [**Doctor First Name **], and Remeron.
In our Emergency Department, the patient was aggressively
fluid resuscitated with 2.5 liters of normal saline without
any response.  As a result, she was started on a dopamine
drip.  She was started on empiric antibiotics consisting of
Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.  She was also given
stress dosed IV steroids.  She was found to be hypothermic
with a rectal temperature of 88.0 F.

Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate, but
electrocardiogram was without any acute changes.  The patient
was also given a dose of Glucagon for possible beta blocker
overdose without any response.  She was stabilized in the
Emergency Department, and then transferred to the Fenard
Intensive Care Unit for further management.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident.  She
was a former private secretary.  She had two daughters, one
of whom died of cancer.  Her other daughter is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]
and is quite involved in her care.  Her home phone number is
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 98293**] and cell is ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 98294**].  She has no
documented tobacco, alcohol, or IV drug use.  Of note, she is
DNR/DNI in terms of code status.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Rectal temperature 88.0 F, blood
pressure 105/56 on a Levophed drip at 0.5 mcg, heart rate 40
and sating 100% on 70% face mask.  In general, the patient
was quite confused and disoriented.  She responded only
minimally to voice.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Mucous membranes are moist.
Oropharynx is clear, but poor dentition.  Cardiac examination
revealed distant S1, S2, bradycardia, no audible murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Lungs were clear bilaterally with
decreased breath sounds at the right base.  Abdomen was soft
and benign with good bowel sounds.  Extremities showed 1+
pitting pedal edema bilaterally, as well as positive
dopplerable pulses bilaterally.  Skin showed a bilateral
erythematous macular rash with confluent excoriations.  There
were multiple weeping open wounds and ulcerations.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Notable for a white count of 5.7
with 60% neutrophils, and 24% lymphocytes, hematocrit 28.
Platelets 307.  INR 1.1.  Urinalysis was negative.  BUN 62,
creatinine 2.6, potassium 5, sodium 142.  LFTs were all
normal.  Amylase and lipase normal.  TSH 4.6, T3 88, T4 1.2.
Random cortisol 15.9.  Arterial blood gas:  7.33, pCO2 41,
pAO2 215 on a nonrebreather.  Lactate level normal at 1.

Head CT scan was negative for any acute processes.  Chest
x-ray showed a questionable right lower lobe infiltrate.

Electrocardiogram showing normal sinus rhythm at a rate of
50, old right bundle branch block, old T-wave inversions in
leads I, III, V1, and V3.  QTc interval slightly prolonged at
500.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
Hypotension:  The patient's hypotension on initial
presentation remains of unclear etiology.  It is thought that
it was most likely due to beta blocker toxicity in the
setting of acute on chronic renal failure.  She was initially
aggressively fluid resuscitated with normal saline, but soon
developed evidence of congestive heart failure, so it was
decided to be more gentle in terms of hydration.  She was
thus kept on Levophed as a pressor [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for about 48 hours
and then was successfully weaned off.  She was given
stress-dosed steroids initially, but as her random cortisol
were normal, these were soon tapered off.  She was
pancultured and started on empiric antibiotics (Vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and Flagyl) with the thought that she may be
displaying vasodilatory shock.  But as her cultures remain
negative and she remained afebrile, her antibiotics were soon
stopped.

Her cardiac enzymes were cycled and were all found to be
negative.  After a few days, the patient's blood pressure
returns back to baseline and she was found to be hypertensive
with systolics between 130 and 175.  As a result, she was
started on low dosed metoprolol at 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] and low dosed
captopril 6.25 tid.

Hypothermia:  This too remains of unclear etiology.  The
patient's core body temperature returned back to normal with
24 hours of a Bair hugger.  Her electrocardiogram displayed
no signs of hypothermia both on admission and 24 hours later.
She was able to maintain normal body temperature throughout
hospital stay.

Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's acute renal
failure was thought to be due to a combination of prerenal
azotemia in the setting of poor po intake along with
increased Lasix, as well as acute tubular necrosis in the
setting of hypotension.  The patient's medications were all
renally dosed and all nephrotoxic medications were avoided.
Over the course of her admission, the patient's creatinine
returned back to baseline at the time of this dictation.  Her
urine output remained excellent during her hospital stay, and
at no point did she display any acute indication for
hemodialysis.

Congestive heart failure:  With a fluid load on admission,
the patient became hypoxic, and displayed clinical signs of
congestive heart failure.  An echocardiogram is to be
obtained immediately prior to discharge to better assess the
patient's ejection fraction and to evaluate for any valvular
disease.  Daily weights were checked.  Strict in's and out's
were monitored and a 2 gram sodium diet adhered to during her
stay.

Immediately prior to discharge, the patient's chest x-ray
showed increasing signs of pulmonary edema, so she was given
20 mg of po Lasix as well as 20 mg of IV Lasix with good
results.  At the time of this dictation summary, the patient
is still slightly volume overloaded.  As
