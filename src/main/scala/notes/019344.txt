Chief Complaint:
pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardiocentesis, drain placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 43 year old woman with no significant past medical
history and is being transferred to the CCU s/p
pericardiocentesis for recurrent pericardial effusion.
.
Patient was in her usual state of health up until [**2106-4-20**] when
she developed RUQ abdominal pain. She was sent to the ED by her
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] that time she had a normocytic anemia 32.5, AST 74, ALT
148, t bili 0.2, ap 97, lipase 32. An abdominal US showed
abnormal thickening of the gallbladder and cholecystitis, w/o
intra/extra hepatic dilatation, changes c/w fatty liver disease,
and a small pleural effusion. She underwent cholecystectomy and
1 week post op developed pericardial effusion. Patient underwent
pericardiocentisis (effusion was primarily rbcs, few wbcs, and
culture negative, including AFP per report). She underwent work
up with TSH elevated to 5.6, with normal free T4 0.72, negative
[**Doctor First Name **], negative rapid strep. She had a mammogram that showed
benign microcalcifications, no radiographic evidence of
malignancy. A repeat echocardiogram [**5-26**] showed EF 60%, nl LV
thickness and wall motion, normal RV/LA, no valvular dysfunction
and no effusion.
.
1 week prior to this admission, patient developed swelling in
her right neck which was thought to be reactive lymphadenopathy.
She also complains of cough. Over the past two days she
developed DOE and went to [**Hospital6 **] where she was
found to have redeveloped pericardial effusion w/o tamponade.
Blood cx sent and patient started on ceftriaxone. Her labs were
notable for WBC 13.7, INR 1.4, Hct 27.9, ALT 128, AST 69, AP
118, LDH 252.
.
Upon arrival to the floor patient had a pulsus pf 15, and an
echocardiogram that showed tamponade physiology and echodense
mass in the R AV groove extending into the pericardial space
that was not viewed on repeat echo. She underwent CT neck/chest
that preliminarily showed: bl pleural effusions, opacity in RUL
w/o air bronchograms c/w pneumonia but cannot exclude underlying
mass, pathologically enlarged lymph nodes on right, filling
defects in svc and L brachiocephalic. While getting CT scan she
had several episodes of hemoptysis. She also had a RUE US for
RUE edema that showed DVT in R subclavian vein.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
