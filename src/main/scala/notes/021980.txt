Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with Angioplasty of the Right Coronary
Artery


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 74 y/o man who was d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2165-9-12**] after an
ileocolectomy and ventral hernia repair for adenocarcinoma of
the ascending colon.  He has a PMH significant for extensive CAD
w/ multiple interventions upon the RCA and its branches, HTN,
and hypercholesterolemia.  He presented to an outside hospital
today after developing weakness and abdominal pain upon waking
up.  He also noted pressure type pain across his chest that is
unlike his previous episodes of angina.  He states that he has
been having multiple watery stools everyday for the past few
days and recently completed a course of Keflex.
At the outside hospital, he was afebrile, bradycardic to the
50s, and hypotensive to the 80s.  His EKG demonstrated evidence
of an infero-lateral MI with ST elevations in II, III, aVF, V5-6
with reciprocal depressions in I, aVL, V2-3.  He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent catheterization.
At [**Hospital1 18**], his cath showed minimal irregular stenosis of the LAD,
40% hazy LCx after OM1, and a totally occluded RCA distally.
Her distal RCA and PL were both ballooned and refractory clot
was treated with abciximab.  He required dopamine in the lab for
hypotension and was transferred to the CCU still on this
pressor.

Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. AAA repair '[**58**]
3. CAD - cath w/ stenting/rotational atherectomy/brachytherapy
of the RCA/RPL/PDA in 99/00 and an EF 44%
4. Hypercholesterolemia
5. ? COPD

Social History:
Pt notes a 50pk/yr smoking history and quit about 2yrs ago.  He
drinks [**3-23**] glasses of wine per day and denies other drug use.
He lives in [**Hospital1 1474**] w/ a roommate and has never been married.

Family History:
Brother had coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft at 57 years. Mother died of congestive heart
failure and rheumatic fever.  Father with unknown history.

Physical Exam:
Gen: WNWD man lying in bed in NAD
HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, O/P clear, MM very dry
Neck: -LAD/JVD
CV: RRR, S1/S2 wnl, -M/R/G appreciated
Lungs: CTA anteriorly
Abd: Soft, non-tender, surgical staples intact, wound C/D/I,
stomach distended and grossly deformed
Ext: -C/C/E, pulses 2+ bilaterally
Neuro: AxO x3

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Catheterization [**8-23**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
one vessel disease. The LMCA was without significant disease.
The LAD
wrapped around the apex and had minor irregularities. The LCX
was
feeding one major OM which was branching and had a hazy 40%
stenosis
after the OM. The OM did not have flow limiting stenoses. The
RCA was a dominant large vessel ond was occluded distally
withing the stent. There was a large PL and PDA system.
  2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed a normal pulmonary
pressure (PA mean 24 mmHg). The right and left sided filling
pressures were normal(RVEDP 9 mmHg, PCW mean 12 mmHg). Cardiac
output was normal (CO 4.9 l/min, CI 2.3 l/min/m2)
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND FINDINGS [**8-23**]:  The right kidney measures 10.4
cm and the left kidney measures 10.6 cm.  There is no
hydronephrosis in either kidney.  There are no focal masses in
the kidneys.  In the upper pole of the left kidney, there is a
3.2 x 3.0 simple-appearing cyst, demonstrating through
transmission.  Normal dromedary hump on the left kidney is
incidentally noted. There are no perirenal fluid collections.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o man recently s/p abdominal surgery who presented with an
acute infero-lateral STEMI.  His RCA was opened in the lab w/
ballooning and he was transferred to the CCU on dopamine for
hypotension. He was weaned from dopamine drip and transferred to
general medicine floor for further observation. He was continued
on his asa/statin/plavix and his bblocker and ace were
restarted. His Acute Renal Failure on admission resolved with
fluid hydration. His diarrhea was found to be due to C. Diff
infection and he was treated with flagyl.  He was seen by the
surgery team for follow up of his colon resection. He had an
episode of confusion while on the general medicine floor during
which he pulled out his foley catheter. This was thought to be
due to ambien, which he took for sleep that night. He had a
short period of hematuria after pulling foley, but this resolved
and he was able to void without difficulty. He had no episodes
of chest pain post procedure and was discharged with follow up
with a cardiologist and prescriptions for ASA, plavix, statin, b
blocker, and ace inhibitor.
