CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2194-3-26**] 4:52 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after CABG.

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2194-3-21**].

The double-lumen left jugular catheter tip is in distal SVC. The
left PICC line tip cannot be visualized, but most likely is in
the superior or mid SVC. The cardiomegaly is moderate , stable.
The replaced valve is in unchanged position. The post-CABG
sternotomy wires and sutures are unremarkable. The NG tube has
been removed in the meantime. The bilateral basal atelectasis is
grossly unchanged with small left more than right amount of
pleural fluid. The patient continues to be in mild failure,
although there is no frank pulmonary edema. No substantial
pneumothorax is demonstrated.

PICC LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: 67-year-old woman with CABG and mitral valve repair.
Please insert a PICC line for TPN.

The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was
performed.

RADIOLOGIST: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1832**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4686**] performed the procedure.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4686**], the Attending Radiologist, was present and
supervised the entire procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
left basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance
using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images were
obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous
access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guidewire and
a double-lumen PICC line measuring 42 cm in length was then
placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in
the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter
was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The
peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The catheter
was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing
applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
5 French double-lumen PICC line placement via the left basilic
venous approach. Final internal length is 42 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2194-3-17**] 2:30 PM

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW

Reason: assess swallow

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess swallow
INDICATION: 67-year-old woman status post CABG. Assess swallow.

VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOW: A video fluoroscopic oropharyngeal
swallow evaluation was done in conjunction with the speech and
swallow pathology division. Bolus formation, control, and tongue
movement were severely impaired with consistent premature
spillage noted. Once the pharyngeal swallow was initiated palate
elevation, laryngeal elevation and epiglottic deflection were
within functional limits. No episodes of penetration or
aspiration were observed throughout today's evaluation though
evaluation was very limited by patient positioning. Solid
residue was noted remaining in the mid- to- distal esophagus
after the evaluation.

IMPRESSION: Severely prolonged oral phase with no definite
evidence of aspiration, though evaluation was limited. Retained
residue within the esophagus. For further details, please
consult the speech and swallow pathology evaluation available on
CareWeb.


Brief Hospital Course:
    Initially the patient was diuresed aggressively with a Lasix
dri
