HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old male
patient with known heart murmur with bicuspid valve since
childhood followed by serial echocardiograms.  Cardiac
echocardiogram on [**2193-4-3**] showed bicuspid valves, severe
aortic stenosis, aortic valve area of 0.5 cm, peak gradient
135, mean gradient 70, moderate left ventricular hypertrophy
with an EF of 55 percent.  Cardiac catheterization on [**5-14**]
showed normal coronaries with severe AS, PA pressure of
25/10.  The patient was referred for cardiac surgery with
plans to undergo aortic valve replacement on [**2193-7-3**].

pressure 120/60, respiratory rate 20, height 5'8" tall, and
weight 170 pounds.  General:  In no acute distress.  Skin:
No lesions.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact,
anicteric.  Neck is supple.  Carotids with radiated murmur.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:
Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2, 4/6 systolic ejection
murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, with
minimal active bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused, no edema, no varicosities.  Neurologic:  alert and
oriented times three.  Moves all extremities.  Strength:
Equal in upper and lower extremities.  Sensation is intact.
Pulses:  Femoral 2 plus right and left.  Dorsalis pedis 2
plus right and left.  PT 2 plus right and left.  Radial 2
plus right and left.

LABS FROM [**2193-5-2**]:  White count 11.3, hematocrit 44.3,
platelets 208.  INR 1.1, PT 12.7.  Sodium 141, potassium 3.9,
chloride 104, bicarb 28, BUN 12, creatinine 0.9, glucose 101.

EKG:  Sinus bradycardia at 56.  Inverted T waves in I, II,
aVL, and V5 through V6, 2.94 V.

CAROTID ULTRASOUND:  Carotid ultrasound with no significant
disease.  Minimal plaque at the origin of ICAs bilaterally.

SUMMARY OF PFTS:  FVC was 88 percent of predicted, FEV1 105
percent of predicted, FEV1:FVC ratio 120 percent of
predicted.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on his
surgical date, [**2193-7-3**].  Went to the operating room and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm Perimount
Tissue Valve under general anesthesia with an indication of
severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm,
peak gradient of 134, and mean gradient of 70 by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].  His cardiopulmonary bypass time was 153 minutes
with a cross-clamp time of 126 minutes.

He was transferred out of the operating room to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit with a mean arterial pressure of 78,
CVP/RA of 15, PAD 17, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 23, A paced at a rate of 80 per
minute.  He was on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.5 mg/minute and
a propofol drip of 15 mcg/kg/minute.  He was rapidly weaned
and extubated on the evening of his postoperative day.

He was atrial paced at a rate of 80 throughout the evening of
postoperative day.  On postoperative day one, he converted to
atrial fibrillation with a max heart rate of 136 treated with
intravenous Lopressor for rate control.  He was also started
on amiodarone.  He was continued on small Neo-Synephrine drip
for blood pressure support.  On postoperative day one, his
chest tubes were discontinued.

On postoperative day three, his Neo-Synephrine was weaned to
off.  His insulin drip was off and amiodarone was changed to
p.o. and he was in a sinus rhythm with a rate of 70.  He was
transferred 2 units of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit of 23.9, and he was transferred to the inpatient
floor.

On the morning of [**7-7**], heart rate converted again to atrial
fibrillation at a rate of about 140 alternating with sinus
bradycardia and premature atrial contractions.  When in sinus
rhythm and sinus bradycardia, he had a first degree A-V block
with elongated Q-T interval.  On postoperative day number
five, [**2193-7-8**], the amiodarone was decreased secondary to
sinus bradycardia with EKGs follow QTc, atrial and
ventricular pacing wires were discontinued also.

He continued to have some short bursts of atrial fibrillation
on the morning of [**7-10**], postoperative day six.  He
experienced continued rapid atrial fibrillation with a rate
of 140, blood pressure of 120-160 systolic.  He received an
IV amiodarone bolus, which converted him to a normal sinus
rhythm with stable blood pressure.  At this time, it was
decided that the patient should be anticoagulated and he was
started on a Heparin drip with p.o. Coumadin.

He began receiving Coumadin on the 9th, receiving 2 mg of
Coumadin on [**7-8**] mg on [**7-9**].5 mg on [**7-10**] with no
Coumadin on the 12th and 2 mg on the 13th.  His INRs
respectively were 1.1 on the 9th, 1.1 on the 10th, 2.5 on the
12th, and 3.2 on the 13th.  Plan is to discharge the patient
home when his INR is therapeutic.

The patient has also experienced an increased white count
throughout his hospital stay with a high of 22.9 on
postoperative day 1, low of 11.7 on postoperative day three.
On the 13th, his white count is 8.2, still with no conclusive
reason for this increased white count.  No signs or symptoms
of infection with cultures pending and differential pending.

On the afternoon of [**7-12**], postoperative day eight, he has
had no episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation for greater than
24 hours.  The patient has been followed by Physical Therapy
throughout his hospital stay and was found to be safe for
home from the physical therapist's standpoint.  The patient
will be discharged home on the morning of [**2193-7-13**] with
visiting nurses to follow his INR and white blood cell count.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.4, pulse 59 in sinus
rhythm/sinus bradycardia, blood pressure 149/64, respiratory

Chest x-ray on [**2193-7-11**] shows bilateral pleural effusions
