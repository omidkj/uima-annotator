Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 56 year-old male with atrial fibrillation s/p AV
ablation and pacemaker placement, dCHF, hypertension transferred
for pacemaker revision.
.
# pacemaker malfunction:  The patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation s/p AV ablation and is pacemaker dependent.  His
pacemaker was failing to capture when he raised his left arm.
He went into a junctional rhythm on the night of his admission
when his pacemaker mode was changed to DDI with rate of 40.  He
was hemodynamically stable at this rate, and the following day
the patient underwent explant of previous pacemaker and inplant
of a new right sided pacemaker with a single ventricular lead.
The patient's heartrate increased to 70 paced rythm.

#Atrial fibrillation: The patient's coumadin was held and 2mg of
vitamin K was given in anticipation of his pacemaker procedure.
He was restarted on his home dose of coumadin to be followed by
his PCP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**] on discharge.

# CORONARIES:  The patient has no history of CAD.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 46**],

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a
malfunctioning pacemaker.  For this, your old pacemaker was
removed and you had a new one implanted on your right side.
Your heart rate was very low while before you had the new
pacemaker implanted, but this normalized once you had the new
pacemaker implanted.  Your symptoms improved prior to your
discharge.

You should leave your right arm in the sling until you go to
your follow-up appointment.  Also, you should under no
circumstances raise your right arm above shoulder height for 6
weeks as this may cause your pacemaker wires to move to an
improper position.  We understand that you at times require
crutches for movement; you should use your crutches only with
your left arm if at all possible.

You have a follow-up appointment in the pacemaker clinic at the
time written below.  It is very important that you go to this
appointment.

You have been prescribed an antibiotic to take for 1 week as
prophylaxis from your new pacemaker becoming infected.  This
antibiotic should not interfere with your coumadin, however you
should follow up with your primary care provider to check your
coumadin blood levels frequently.
Your amlodipine was also increased to 10mg daily.
You have been given tylenol with codeine to take as needed for
pain for your pacemaker insertion.

Followup Instructions:
You have the following appointments scheduled:

Provider:  [**Name10 (NameIs) 676**] CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] Date/Time:[**2112-3-8**]

and informed him of your admission.  They will be following up
with your visiting nurse when they check your blood coumadin
levels.  You should also make an appointment to see him within
the next 2 weeks.
