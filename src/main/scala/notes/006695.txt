Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Severe global LV hypokinesis. Severely depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Eccentric MR jet. Effective regurgitant orifice is
>=0.40cm2. Severe (4+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated LA pressure.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Mild PR. The end-diastolic PR velocity is increased c/w PA
diastolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Quantitative (3D)
LVEF = 27 %. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. An eccentric,
posterioly directed jet of severe 4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The effective regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2 The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severely depressed left ventricular function. Severe
mitral regurgitation. Depressed right ventricular function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

Final Report
HISTORY: Post cardiac surgery.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**9-21**], the Swan-Ganz
catheter has been
removed. Persistent atelectatic changes at the left base. Little
change in
