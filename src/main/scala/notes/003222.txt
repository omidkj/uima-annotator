Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
65M with hx of hypertension, hypothyroidism presenting with
shortness of breath and fever. He was in his usual state of
health until ~2 weeks ago at which time he developed mild
shortness of breath and cough. He described cough as the
dominant symptom when he first came to the MICU; on transfer to
the medicine service he emphasized the history of dyspnea on
exertion. He denied sinus congestion, headache, rhinorrhea or
sore throat. His dyspnea on exertion continued; he says that
today he came to the emergency department because "my wife made
me" come. He had chest wall pain bilaterally by his history with
me (described as left-sided when he first came in), which he
says was worsened by deep breathing and coughing.
.
In the ED, his initial vital signs were 100.7 132 230/80 42 99%
NRB. He was initially placed on nitroglycerin gtt for blood
pressure control. A CXR was inconclusive for edema vs.
infiltrate. His BNP returned low so the nitroglycerin gtt was
discontinued in favor of labetalol. He received ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin; he grew out GPCs so was started on vancomycin;
these returned as pan-sensitive pneumococcus, so vanco was
d/c'ed and IV penicillin G was started while the patient was in
the MICU. He was called out to the floor as his clinical
condition improved.
.
ROS: no HA, abd pain, no dysuria, no rash, no leg swelling. no
weight gain. no increasing abd girth. + snores, no known apneic
spells during sleep.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 65M with hx of hypertension, hypothyroidism who presented
with fever, cough and respiratory distress.
.
# Respiratory Distress: Exam and imaging were very consistent w
pneumococcal pneumonia, and most conclusively, [**3-31**] blood
cultures from [**6-4**] were positive for strep pneumo. Urine
legionella was negative. There was a small left sided effusion
visualized on CT chest but this was too small for thoracentesis;
ultimately since Mr [**Known lastname **] was improving clinically, the team
felt there was no urgent need to pursue this further unless he
were to worsen. His cultures were no growth starting on [**6-5**]; he
had started on effective treatment in the emergency department
on [**6-4**]. He was continued on penicillin G while on the floor, and
ultimately after consulting the infectious disease service we
decided he would finish out his course on amoxicillin, with
eight more days of antibiosis after the six days he had received
in the hospital.
.
# Hearing loss: Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of a sensation of
discomfort in his ear just prior to coming into the hospital,
and while here he noted decreased hearing in the left ear. On
examination, there were very small bullae in the upper portion
of the tympanic membrane, suggestive of early/mild bullous
myringitis which can be seen with strep pneumoniae. We set him
up with audiologic evaluation, and will refer him to ENT if
indicated based on the audiologic evaluation.

# Penile lesion: Mr [**Known lastname **] had a slightly bulbous and
circumferential depigmented lesion around the foreskin of his
penis. Originally we thought this might have been an unfortunate
effect of the condom catheter but it remained after
discontinuing the catheter. We referred him for [**Known lastname **]
follow-up with concern that this might represent a malignancy.
.
# Hypothyroidism: He had not been on medicines since he had lost
his health care insurance about 5 years prior; he reported
weight gain and poor energy and recalled a past diagnosis of low
thyroid. His TSH was elevated to 37 with FT4 low at 0.45. We
started levothyroxine at previous home dose of 75mcg; given that
his values were checked in the inpatient setting of critical
illness these should be followed up when he is more stable.
.
# Hypertension: He was hypertensive coming in to ED, was mostly
normotensive in the days after that, and then towards the end of
his admission was hypertensive again; he was sent out on a
starting dose of HCTZ. This should be followed up in subsequent
outpatient visits.
.
# Anemia: There was no evidence of blood loss. His labs were
consistent with an anemia of chronic inflammation. This might be
from the pneumonia or some more chronic cause and should be
followed.
.
# Acute renal failure: He was originally in acute renal failure,
likely from pre-renal state exacerbated by NSAIDs. His
creatinine had normalized by the time of discharge.
.
# Abdominal distension: Abdominal U/S showed no ascites or other
acute issues; it did show a possibly fibrotic/cirrhotic liver
but no ascites nor splenomegaly to suggest portal hypertension.
His LFTs were normal as was synthetic function and normal
platelets. His physical exam was benign and as he improved
clinically we saw no evidence of abdominal process, and his
abdominal appearance may simply be from disproportionate
abdominal obesity.
.
# FEN: He was given a heart-healthy diet and lytes were repleted
PRN.
.
#ACCESS: PIV
