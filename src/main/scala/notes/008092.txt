 RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2179-10-6**] 2:50 AM
Reason: [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
88 year old man with esophageal mass eroding into trachea
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? amount of erosion
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Esophageal mass eroding into trachea. Question
amount of erosion.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images of the chest without the use of
intravenous contrast material. Images were displayed with 5- and
1.25-mm slice thickness in the axial plane.

FINDINGS: There is a soft tissue mass, subsuming the esophagus,
extending from the level of the thoracic inlet caudally at least
to the subcarinal level. The maximum dimensions in the axial
plane are 3.6 x 3.6 cm and at least 10 cm in craniocaudal
dimension. The inferior border of the mass is difficult to
determine as it is smoothly tapering. There is apparent invasion
of the posterior wall of the trachea over a segment of
approximately 7 cm. Inferior to the endotracheal tube, the
residual lumen measures 8 x 6 mm. The mass is inseparable from
the innominate artery as well as the aortic arch with possible
invasion of both vessel walls (no residual fat plane). There is
thickening along the posterior aspect of the right main stem
bronchus and bronchus intermedius, likely representing an
extension of the mass. No intraluminal invasion is apparent.
There are bilateral small pleural effusions and mild left
basilar compressive atelectasis. There is bronchiectasis and
surrounding peribronchial fibrotic thickening in the right upper
lobe of uncertain significance. This may represent post
radiation changes if there is a history of malignancy. The
patient is status post midline sternotomy, apparently performed
for treatment of motor vehicle accident trauma, according to the
CareWeb notes.

No acute pathology is seen in the partially visualized upper
abdominal organs. A 1-mm area of calcification on the most
inferior image slice in the left kidney may represent a
nonobstructing calculus or vascular calcification. The study is
not designed for evaluation of abdominal organs.

IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue mass centered around the upper esophagus,
inseparable from the innominate artery and tip of aortic arch
with likely extension into the wall of the right main stem
bronchus and bronchus intermedius. The mass is also invading the
posterior tracheal wall and causing luminal narrowing distal to
the endotracheal tube.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions and mild left basal
atelectasis.
3. Bronchiectasis with peribronchial, likely chronic, thickening
in the right upper lobe of uncertain etiology. Is there a
history of radiation therapy?
4. Partially visualized stone or vascular calcification in the
left kidney.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2179-10-7**] 7:58 AM
Reason: r/o pneumo
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
88 year old man with metastatic esophageal cancer and central
airway obstruction
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o pneumo
AP CHEST, 8:32 A.M., [**10-7**]
HISTORY: Metastatic esophageal cancer. Central airway
obstruction.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-6**]:
Endotracheal tube has been removed, leaving a mild subglottic
edema. Tracheal stent at the level of the aortic arch is
unchanged in position, and the left lung volumes are lower, with
new left lower lobe atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is
engorged and cardiac size has increased, though still top
normal. Mediastinal contours are unchanged, although the extent
of the upper esophageal mass is not fully apparent on plain
radiographs. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion, if any, is
minimal on the left.


Brief Hospital Course:
88M with met esophageal cancer c erosion/compression of trachea
p/w SOB now intubated.
Patient admitted [**2179-10-5**] to ICU for ongoing critical management.
Night of admission, CT of neck/chest done, pre-op for OR- rigid
bronchoscopy, possible stent placement.
HD#2- Maintained in ICU. To OR w/ Inter Pul for:Rigid
bronchoscopy, Flexible bronchoscopy,Balloon dilatation, Metallic
stent placement. Patient re-intubated into metallic stent post
procedure for overnight observation.  Overnight course
significant for transient hypotension related to sedation,
treated w/ decreasing sedation, neo gtt/ IVF for 3hours.  EKG-
no changes, enzymes flat. Hypotension resolved w/ d/c of
sedation in am prior to extubation. T- 100.6; Vanco
HD#3/PPD1- Patient stable in early am, sedation weaned w/o
complication. Pt extubated in controlled critical care setting
w/o complication, RR 20, sat 100% on.50 face tent.  Hct 26.9
from 28.4 pre-op. Pt heomdynamically stable.
Pt stable post- procedure and ready for transfer back to
acute/critical referring facility.
99.2/98.4/84/108/48/16-20/100% .50 face tent. See pertinent
results for lab data.
Patient was transferred back to care under Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12056**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 634**] at
the ICU at [**Hospital6 2561**].
