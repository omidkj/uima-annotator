Pertinent Results:
[**2169-11-27**] ECHO
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesia of
the apex and hypokinesia of the apical as well as mid portions
of the anterior, anteriorseptum and septal walls. . Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2169-11-27**]
at 1020am.

Post bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine
and epinephrine. LV systolic function is slightly improved.
LVEF= 30%. Aorta is intact post decannulation. RV function is
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35981**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2169-11-27**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to four vessels. Please see the operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care
unit. Over the next 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. His drips were weaned and beta blockade, aspirin
and a statin were resumed.  He had atrial fibrillation and
converted with amiodarone.  He was coumadinized for his atrial
fibrillation.  His chest tubes were removed and he was
transferred to the surgical step down floor.  By post-operative
day five he was ready for discharge to home with coumadin
follow-up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
