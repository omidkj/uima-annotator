TTE:   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the basal 2/3rds of the inferolateral and basal inferior walls.
The distal septum is also hypokinetic. The remaining segments
contract well. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Cath:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful PCI of the LAD.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant
system.
The LMCA had no angiographic disease. The LAD had 70% ostial and
sequential 80% proximal lesions with diffuse moderate disease.
The Lcx
had on occluded OM2 with diffuse severe proximal disease and an
80%
mid-vessel lesion. The RCA had an 80% proximal lesion with a
total
occlusion after a high-rising PDA which had proximal disease to
70%.
The rCA filled via LCA collaterals.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated left-sided
filling pressures (PCWP 21 mmHg mean). The right sided filling
pressures were mildly elevated (RA mean 6mmHg, PA mean 30mmHg).
The
calculated cardiac index was 2.1 l/min/m2.
4. Successful PCI of the LAD with rotational atherectomy with a
1.5 mm
burr and PTCA/Stenting using a 2.5 x 28 mm Cypher DES
(overlapping, covering both ostial and proximal LAD lesions). A
7 French IABP was placed in the RFA prophylactically during the
case and removed at the end of the case.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old male with PVD, hx CVA, htn, DM with PNA and early
sepsis, precipitating demand ischemia then unstable angina then
myocardial damage and cardiogenic hemodynamic embarassament.

1.  CAD:  Pt's peak CK 4156.  Initially attributed to demand
event in setting of comorbidities (see below), but then
developed run of symptatic monomorphic VT, which was attributed
to coronary disease, so Mr.[**Known lastname **] was then taken to the cath lab.
Found to have 3VD with probable culprit lesion mid-LAD.  After
extensive discussion with family, the decision to defer CABG was
made based on high risk of peri-operative mortality.  After
overlap stenting of LAD, the pt remains pain free and stable.
Pt was started on aspirin and plavix, and will be on plavix for
at least 9 months.  Beta-blocker was carefully started, given hx
of hypotension.  Will be d/c'd on toprol XL 50 qD.  Also on
lisinopril 10 mg po QD.  High-dose statin for life.  Mr.[**Known lastname **]
could very well continue to have angina that may be secondary to
his non-revascularized LCx, RCA, OM2 or PDA lesions.

2.  Pump:  Pt with EF 35-40% with regional wall motion
abnormalities.  Cardiac output and index 3.5/2.1, PCWP 28, and
SVR 1600.  IABP was used transiently during the pt's cath.  He
transiently required dopamine, which was switched to
neosynephrine then vasopressin.  This pressor requirement was
attributed to combination cardiogenic shock and early sepsis.
He currently has no pressor requirement.  Digoxin was added to
Mr.[**Known lastname **] regimen to augment his inotropy.  Pt diuresed while in
house but does not require any further diuresis as outpt.  Now
that pt is partly revascularized, his EF may have improved
slightly and he may need an ECHO in the future to better
estimate his systolic function.

3.  Rhythm:  Mr.[**Known lastname **] was noted to have a variety of arrhythmias
while in house.  His sinus rhythm has prolonged AV nodal delay
of 225 msec and inferior Q's on surface ECG.  Prior to cath the
pt had occasional 6-8 beat runs of NSVT.  He also had a 40 beat
run monomorphic VT 24 hours following recanulization, which was
self-terminated.  He did not have any further episodes of VT or
NSVT.  Mr.[**Known lastname **] was also noted to go in and out of A-fib/flutter.
 His ventricular response is controlled in the 70's - 90's.
Digoxin was started to further control his rate.  He will be
discharged with toprol XL 50 mg po qD for further rate control
(please watch the pt's PR if deciding to titrate up the
beta-blocker, or any other nodal blocker).  The pt has been
started on coumadin given his very high CHADS risk score of [**6-18**].


4.  ID:  Pt noted to have a dirty UA on admission and a left
lower lobe infiltrate on CXR.  His hypotension was initially
attributed to infection/sepsis, but his hemodynamics were more
consistent with cardiogenic shock (see above).  He was started
on levaquin and ceftriaxone for UTI and PNA.  All urine and
blood cultures have returned with no growth.  Max WBC 24.9 (with
30% bandemia) and temperature 101.9.  These trended down and
currently Mr.[**Known lastname **] has no fever and his WBC count is 8.1.  His
ceftriaxone was d/c'd on day #5.  The patient will continue on
l
