Malaise, fatigue

History of Present Illness:
81 yo h/o COPD, PNAs, PEs, [**First Name3 (LF) 9215**] (EF 55%) recently tapered down
on steroids, presents w 2 days fatigue, malaise, and lethargy.
She notes that SOB and non-productive cough are chronic. She
notes she has gained several lbs in last week. Of note, she
recently completed a course of 6 months of coumadin on [**1-24**] for
a PE. She noted some chills this am but denies any fevers, sick
contacts, myalgias, chest pain, abd. pain, N/V/D, rashes, or
dysuria.
In the ED, initial VS: 99.6 92 129/79 20 100. Later she spiked
to 101.5. At that point she converted to a.fib with RVR up to
the 140s with associated hypotension to the 70s. Given 10mg IV
and 30mg PO diltiazem with rates returned to the 80s and
improved BP. However, her BP subsequently dropped to the 80s
again prior to being sent to the floor. She also received 750mg
levofloxacin, one percocet for hip pain (chronic baseline).

In the MICU, 97/50 on arrival after IVF in the ED. Given stress
dose steroids, levofloxacin, flu ruled out, negative BNP and
D-dimer. CT chest consistent with PNA. Speech and swallow saw
patient and recommended reflux precautions. Afebrile,
79-117/50-85 range in ICU (avg ~100/60), 65, 100RA.
.
Currently, she feels much better and has no complaints.

light touch diffusely
DERM: Multiple echymosis, no rash
.


Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe consolidation is most compatible with a
community-acquired
bacterial infection given the acute time course. There is no
evidence of an
obstructive mass. A 4-week followup with conventional
radiography is
recommended.
2. Stable moderate emphysema.
3. 4-mm right lower lobe nodule, unchanged since [**2140**], does not
require
dedicated followup [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] guidelines.
4. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.

CXR
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The cardiac silhouette is
normal in size.
Mitral annular calcifications are again demonstrated. The
mediastinal and
hilar contours are unremarkable, with aortic knob calcifications

redemonstrated. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. New
ill-defined opacity
is noted within the left lower lobe, worrisome for an area of
infection.
Multiple punctate calcified granulomas are again seen within the
right lung.
[**Hospital1 **]-apical scarring is again demonstrated. There is
hyperinflation of the
lungs with flattening of the diaphragms and relative lucency
within the lung
apices suggestive of underlying emphysema. The osseous
structures demonstrate
no acute skeletal abnormalities.

IMPRESSION: New ill-defined left lower lobe opacity concerning
for pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia: Initially found to have persistent and slightly
worse LLL infiltrate. She presented with SOB and a new O2
requirement, and her baseline cough of 6 year's duration. She
was febrile in the ED but without elevated WBC count. A Flu swab
was checked and found to be negative. On the medicine floor she
was without an O2 requirement or symptomatic hortness of breath.
 Given out concern that this PNA may represent an inadequately
treated prior PNA, her levofloxacin was changed to an MDR
regimen of ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  She was then changed
to cefpodoxime to complete a 7 day total course after the abx
were changed. For symptomatology we gave Cough suppressants PRN,
and continued her home COPD regimen.  We also emailed Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 575**], her primary pulmonologist to discuss possible causes
of recurrent PNA. He will see her as an outpatient.

PLAN GOING FORWARD:
Cefpodoxime 200mg [**Hospital1 **] until [**2-10**]
Azithromycin 500MG QD until [**2-8**]
.
# HCT drop/Iron Deficiency Anemia: This dropped from 32 on
admission to a low of 24 today.  This was thought to be from IVF
resuscitation in the unit. She has no signs of active bleeding,
and is guaiac negative.  She has never had a colonoscopy.
However she continued to drop and was transfused 1 unit PRBC,
she is iron deficient on labs (Ferritin is 21).
.
PLAN GOING FORWARD:
Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] to discuss guaiac cards vs colonoscopy on [**2-23**]
Ferrous Sulfate 325 TID with ascorbic acid
Bowel Regimen
.
# COPD:  For her baseline COPD we continued her home steroids,
spiriva, albuterol etc.
.
# Hypotension: She initially dropped her presures in the setting
of A.fib with RVR and again subsequently dropped likely related
to medication effect and hypovolemia. She was given IVF, and was
at her home baseline on transfer. This never manifested itself
on the floor.
.
# Hyperlipidema:We Continued her home statin, ASA
.
# Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: Stress dose steroids and then
back to home dose.
.
# A.fib: She converted and was in sinus at the time of transfer.
 She is off her coumadin until after her hip replacement
.
