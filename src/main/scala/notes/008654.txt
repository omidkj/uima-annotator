History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 64F with hx of CLL s/p chemo, multiple drug
allergies, recent left TKA at [**Hospital6 2910**] p/w
fever, rash. The pt was in her USOH until [**2200-2-26**] when she
underwent left TKR at NEBH. At the time she received general
anesthesia, receiving perioperative clindamycin, and
postoperative dilaudid for pain control. She was also started on
coumadin for DVT ppx. On Saturday the pt noticed that her legs
and back were a little red. On Monday she noticed progressive
worsening of the rash, with temperatures at home max 101.3. On
[**2200-3-4**], she presented to NEBH where they found her to have a
"diffuse maculopapular rash from head to toe which is confluent
on the face, the neck, the torso, the back, and the lower legs.
It is spotty at the arms and upper thighs." She was found to
have WBC 20.6, HCT 34.1, plt 407, ESR 43, CRP 130, AST 103, ALT
74. CXR clear, BCx NGTD. She was given solumedrol 60mg IV and
benadryl 25mg PO, and was discharged with prednisone taper.

On Wednesday [**2200-3-5**], she presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with
complaints of persistent fever and rash. VS 100.9 93 106/56 18,
though SBP dropped to the 90s, but came up with 2L NS. Labs
showed WBC 32 (94%), AST 119, ALT 145. Derm was consulted and
felt this was likely consistent with drug rash but could not
rule out infection. She was given prednisone 1mg/kg (80mg),
vancomycin, with instructions to start gram negative coverage on
the floor.

On arrival to the ICU, her VS were 113/41 HR 93. She endorsed
some persistent itching/pain from diffuse morbiliform rash
sparing her palms, soles and mucosal membranes, generalized
discomfort but no localized pain. She remained afebrile in the
ICU without tachycardia or hypotension noted.

Just prior to transfer to the medicine floor, she endorses mild
pruritis, which is relieved by the sarna lotion. She reports
that her rash seems to be slightly improved from a few days ago.
She endorses mild anxiety today, which she usually takes
lorazepam for at bedtime for. She denies any fevers today.

SUMMARY OF CLL/SLL HISTORY:
(1) In 10/00, she had removal of a left inguinal lymph node
showing CLL/SLL.
(2) In [**2191**], she had excisional biopsy of a rapidly enlarging
submental mass. This showed small lymphocytic lymphoma; there
was
no evidence of transformation.
(3) On [**2195-10-1**], she saw dermatologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1022**] for
evaluation of a skin rash on her thighs as detailed prior notes.
Biopsies were obtained showing "palisading granulomatous
dermatitis" c/w "granuloma annulare or annular elastocytic
granuloma." She began topical steroids, with improvement in
treated lesions. However, additional asymptomatic disc-shaped
erythematous  lesions have appeared in crops on both thighs.
(4) Begins C1 FCR chemotherapy on [**2195-12-9**]. Course complicated
with 3 separate hospitalizations. Hospitalized [**Date range (1) 101337**] for
febrile neutropenia. No fever source found. Readmitted [**12-26**] to
[**2196-1-7**] with fever to 103.7F. Defervesced with broad antibiotic
coverage; again source not found. Found to have bilateral
pleural
effusions, R>L. On [**2195-12-29**], underwent R thoracentesis with
removal of 1.4 liters fluid that was consistent with exudative
process. Effusion reaccumulated. On [**2196-1-4**], underwent a R
thoracoscopy with drainage of pleural effusion and biopsy of 3
pleural nodules. Fluid was transudative. Pleural fluid cultures
were negative. On [**2196-1-18**], readmitted after developing fever to
103.6F with shortness of breath. Again no source found. Large L
pleural effusion tapped on [**2196-1-19**] with improvement.
(5) Received cycle 2 Fludarabine/Cytoxan X 2 days on [**1-26**] and
[**2196-1-27**]. Rituximab held.
(6) On [**4-9**], [**2-25**], received full dose FCR with Rituxan
included, and Neulasta support.
(7) Received cycle 4 full dose FCR [**Date range (1) 101338**].

Brief Hospital Course:
64F with hx of CLL s/p chemo, multiple drug allergies, recent
left TKR p/w fever, rash, found to have leukocytosis,
transaminitis, elevated lactate.
.
#Fever, Rash: Pt presents with new onset diffuse, confluent
morbiliform rash with a few bullae a week post-operative TKA.
The appearance of the rash, leukocytosis, fever, transaminitis
raise concern for drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome.  She
received clindamycin perioperatively, has a known allergy to
cef/zosyn/sulfas.  It  does not seem that any of these were
given.  She was started on hydromorphone a
