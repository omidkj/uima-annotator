History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21218**] is a 64 year old male with medical history
including hypertension and GERD who was in his usual state of
health until 2 days ago. he reports sunday night that he feeled
some sensation of increasing restlessness and difficulty
sleeping although this is not that atypical for him. Monday
afternoon he had decreased appetitie but attempted to eat some
pineapple and strawberries. He felt nauseous later in the
afternoon and vomited this food up, denies identifiying blood in
his vomitus at that time. The following morning he again felt
increasingly fatigued but went to work per usual. That morning
he felt lightheaded and then had a sense of a need to pass
stool. He reports a sensation of diarrhea but saw that he had
passd what is described as black stool with halo of maroon
around it. He had two additional episodes of passing black stool
that same day with decreased volume. The patient sought care
with his PCP who confirmed guaiac positive stool and sent the
patient to [**Hospital **] hospital for further evaluation. On arrival
he reports sensation at the bottom of his sternal of
burning/pressure that was similar to episodes of what he thought
was reflux, but much more intense. He denies radiation,
nausea/diaphoresis or dyspnea with these symptoms. The patient
reports that at baseline his functional activity is limited
secondary to arthritis and obesity although he recently had an
exercise stress test with imaging that was normal per his verbal
report.
For his symptoms the patient was evaluated at an OSH with Hct of
29. NG lavage at the outside hospital was negative for bright
blood. At [**Location (un) **] he was treated with SL Nitro and Morphine and
subsequently developed hypotension which resolved wiht fluid
bolus. An ECG at the outside hospital was concerning for lateral
ST depressions although enzymes at that time were flat. The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
ED Course: In the ED the patient had vitals of 98.9 132/59 70 16
97% RA. The patient had repeat Hct which was 28 compared to 29
at OSH. Received 2U PRBCs in ED. He was given protonix IV.
Repeat cardiac enzymes now reveal elevated CK and Troponin
312/.30. The patient was seen by cardiology with impression that
he likely has a fixed circ lesion and his current NSTEMI is
secondary to demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed. The patient
reports he does not take ASA daily. He has been taking Ibuprofen
400mg daily for couple weeks for left shoulder discomfort. He
does not actively smoke or drink.

melena/BRBPR which began on [**4-5**]. At OSH patient had "Chest
Pressure" [**8-21**], epigastric, w/ reported ST depressions on
lateral leads, but flat troponins. OSH hct 29. In MICU patient

of blood. GI has been consulted. EGD is planned for AM.
.
No more episodes of CP while in the unit. Pt is NOT on ASA,
plavix or heparin. [**4-6**] ECG, concerning for v3-v6 ST depressions
and TWI, 1mm V1 st elevation, I/AVL ST 1mm ST depressions and
TWI.
.
Patient now ruled in for an NSTEMI. See below.

140/92(131/71-140/94), RR 12, 99% on 3L.
.
Patient arrived on the floor, and developed [**5-21**] SSCP,
nonradiating, ECG w/ and w/o pain were done, patient was given
SL NTG 0.4mg x3 relieved pain down to zero. HR 60 and BP 150/70
w/ [**5-21**] CP. CP developed after patient had repeat melanotic
stool.

FINDINGS: Single frontal chest radiograph examination,showing an
area of increased opacity seen projected over the right heart
border. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent. The heart
size is mildly enlarged. No pleural effusion is seen.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. A focal opacity is seen projected over the right heart border
most likely in the right lung base secondary to either
atelectasis and/or aspiration however pneumonia cannot be
completely excluded since we do not have any prior
studies.Follow up exam in not less than three weeks with a
dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs.
2. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent, indicating
volume overload however no edema is noted.
[**4-6**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid to distal antero-septum,
anterior wall and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect.
