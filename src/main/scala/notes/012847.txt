colonoscopy [**2138-9-26**] performed for change in bowel habis which
demonstrated a large cecal polyp which was biopsied.  The biopsy
returned as adenoma, and thus she returned for endoscopic
mucosal resection (EMR) polypectomy on [**2138-10-27**], where the
procedure was performed without complication.  An endoclip was
placed to prevent bleeding.  The pathology returned as adenoma
without dysplasia or carcinoma.

constipation and she took dulcolax once three days prior.  She
had minor left lower quadrant cramping yesterday, which has

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 45 year-old female with history of cecal polypectomy
[**2138-10-27**] presenting with bright red blood per rectum.
.
# Bright red blood per rectum: Initially admitted into the ICU
for monitoring, and called out to the floor on day of discharge.
Her BRBPR was presumed due to delayed post-polypectomy bleeding
from [**2138-10-27**].  Also on the differential was diverticular bleed
with diverticula noted on recent colonoscopy, although less
likely.  No free air on abdominal x-ray.  No coagulopathy.  She
received two units PRBC [**11-4**] for hct drop to 26 from 33 on
admission, with hct 32 at discharge. She did not have signs of
active bleeding during the day on [**11-4**] or on [**11-5**] (day of
discharge). Colonoscopy was planned for [**11-5**] based on poor prep
for [**11-4**]. The gasteroenterology service was consulted and
followed her during her MICU stay and thereafter. On [**11-5**] the
pt still was not adequately prepped despite Mg Citrate x2 and
Golytley, and given stable hct and no further GI bleeding, GI
decided that colonoscopy was no longer necessary. The patient
was instructed to avoid ASA and NSAIDS for several weeks, and to
return if she had any recurrent bleeding or dizziness.
.
# Adenomatous Polyp: The patient will require repeat colonoscopy
in 1 year for follow up.
.
# Epilepsy: Continued Gabapentin
.
# Depression: Continued Venlafaxine and Clonazepam PRN
.
# Tobacco abuse: Given a nicotine patch. Counseled on cessation
at discharge.

stable, hematocrit stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with complaints of rectal bleeding. This was
thought to be due to the polypectomy that was done on [**2138-10-27**].
You required 2 units of blood while you were in the intensive
care unit. Your bleeding has stopped. You should avoid aspirin,
ibuprofen, motrin, and aleve for the next 2-3 weeks as these can
increase risk of bleeding. You should eat clears and soft solids
for the next day (ie soups, jello, yogurt, mashed potatoes), and
then advance as tolerated to a regular diet.
.
You will need a repeat colonoscopy in 1 year, given that you had
a large adenomatous polyp.
.
You should try to quit smoking as tobacco is harmful to your
lungs and can cause lung cancer. You can talk to your primary
care doctor more about this.
.
Call your doctor or return to the ER for recurrent rectal
bleeding, lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, abdominal pain,
or any other concerning symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
