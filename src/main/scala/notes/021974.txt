CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain, shortness of breath and lower
extremity edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year-old Caucasian
male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction with three stents placed in [**2143**] at
[**Hospital3 2358**] who notes increasing lower extremity swelling,
dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath times one week.  He
has had cellulitis in his lower extremities on and off for
seven years.  Last antibiotic treatment was three to four
months ago.  He had two pillow orthopnea, positive paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, but denies chest pain, although he has had
pressure, but no recently.  Dry cough, denies fevers, chills,
rigors, urinary tract infection symptoms, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, lightheadedness or
dizziness.  His normal weight was approximately 326 pounds in
[**2146-10-31**].  He denies recent salt ingestion, dietary
indiscretion.  The patient states that he is compliant with
medications at home.  The patient has baseline hypoxia at
home with home oxygen.  Denies obstructive sleep apnea or
CPAP use at home.  He reports that with previous myocardial
infarction he did not have chest pain, but had shortness of
breath, which is his anginal equivalent.  At the outside
hospital before transfer the patient was receiving
intravenous Lasix 80 mg as well as a nitro patch.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.8.  Blood pressure
165/79.  Heart rate 93.  Respiratory rate 18.  Satting 92% on
2 liters.  In general, this is a pleasant obese male in no
acute distress.  The patient is edentulous.  Oropharynx is
clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Neck JVP approximately
10 cm no masses.  Chest bilateral bibasilar rales to [**12-3**] of
the way up.  Occasional wheezing.  Coronary distant heart
sounds.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended, obese, decreased bowel sounds.  Groin 2+
femoral pulses on the right.  No bruits.  Extremities
bilateral erythema.  Positive warmth.  No drainage.  2+
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.  Old
scar bilaterally from his bypass.  Neurological alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  Potassium 3.9, creatinine 2.4,
hematocrit 37.8, white blood cell count 9.1 with 78% polys,
9% monocytes as well.  Initial CK was 169, troponin 0.07.
Outside hospital INR was 1.3, creatinine 0.6.  Echocardiogram
at the outside hospital [**10/2146**] EF 29 to 30%, global
hypokinesis, mild four chamber enlargement, mild tricuspid
regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, mild AS per reported.
Electrocardiogram prolonged QRS with right bundle branch
block morphology, left axis deviation, T wave inversions in
V1 to V3, one in AVL, Qs in 3 and AVF, early R wave
progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient
had a known EF of 30% per his last echocardiogram.  However,
he presented with an acute decompensation of his congestive
heart failure, unclear etiology.  Infection versus ischemia
versus dietary indiscretion.  The patient was ruled out for
an acute myocardial infarction while in house.  He was
initially diuresed with a low dose intravenous Lasix,
however, given the extreme amount of volume overload that he
had an Natrecor drip was started for a three day trial fro
which he did not diurese well.  The patient was switched back
to intravenous Lasix with improvement of his diuresis at a
goal of 1 liter out per day.  The patient was maintained on
Carvedilol at his home dose and an ace inhibitor was held
given his chronic renal insufficiency.  The patient was also
on a nitrate initially for afterload reduction.  A repeat
echocardiogram was performed, which showed severe AS with a
gradient of 80 and moderate AI, so nitrates were discontinued
and the patient was judiciously diuresed with intravenous
Lasix.  Digoxin was held during his hospitalization stay in
light of his elevated creatinine.  The patient improved with
diuresis throughout his hospital course to his baseline
weight.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient underwent initial
cardiac catheterization on [**12-26**], which showed
multivessel disease and severe aortic stenosis.  No
intervention was performed in favor of possibly doing
coronary artery bypass graft given his severe three vessel
disease and possible atrial valve repair at which point
cardiac surgery was consulted who recommended that a coronary
artery bypass graft was not recommended in this patient,
however, aortic valve replacement was a consideration.
However, in preparation for the aortic valve repair surgery
the patient should have his coronaries optimized and
therefore went for a repeat catheterization on [**12-27**]
with placement of a stent to his left circumflex artery for
improved flow.  Post catheterization he had some minor slow
groin bleed, which resolved with pressure dressing intact.
The patient was maintained on an aspirin, statin, his Plavix
was discontinued in anticipation of aortic valve surgery.  He
was maintained on aspirin, statin and his Carvedilol for
improvement of his cardiac regimen.

3.  Aortic stenosis:  The patient had a valve area per last
echocardiogram that was obtained at the outside hospital in
[**2144-5-1**] at a valve area of 0.9 cm squared.  The patient
post catheterization showed severe AS and the patient
underwent aortic valve repair surgery on [**2146-12-30**].
The remainder of this hospital course will be dictated
postoperative regarding his aortic valve repair surgery.

4.  Rhythm:  The patient has an EF of 30%.  He had several
runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on [**12-22**]
and [**12-25**], however, the patient was asymptomatic.  The
patient should like benefit from an evaluation by
electrophysiology for determinants of a AICD placement,
intracardiac defibrillator placement, but this evaluation
should be performed after his aortic valvular repair surgery.
The patient had his electrolytes optimized.

5.  Cellulitis:  The patient had mild lower extremity
cellulitis bilaterally given his significant Penicillin
allergy and Levaquin allergy and the fact that the patient
had a history of MRSA.  The patient was gi
