Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 65686**]
Chief Complaint:
confusion, found to have right Frontal and Left parietal brain
lesions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stereotactic Brain Biopsy


History of Present Illness:
85 yo right handed M who was in his usual good state of health
until 2 weeks ago when family began to notice change in mental
status - he lost his way when driving to familiar place and has
not been as engaged in daily activities.  He denies headache,
seizures, visual changes.
.
Patient presented electively on [**12-14**] for stereotactic brain
biopsy of his right frontal lesion.  He tolerated the procedure
well and was extubated in the OR then transferred to the PACU
for recovery.  After a short period of time in the PACU he was
trasnferred to the floor where he remained stable overnight. On
the morning of POD#1 he was seen by physical therapy who
recommended that he would need to be sent to a rehab facility.
Rehab screen was started on [**12-15**]. On the evening on [**12-15**] he
grew increasingly confused and agitated, and was likely
sundowning.  He was given zyprexa SL x 1 and placed in a posey.
He remained agitated overnight, and in the morning was more
calm.  A geriatric consult was obtained, and they recommended
that seroquel be given for agitation, and for his dexamethasone
to be tapered to 2mg [**Hospital1 **].  A UA and CXR were obtained on [**12-16**],
which were both negative for an infectious process. He became
increasingly difficult to arouse on [**12-16**] in the evening, and a
head CT was obtained which demosntrated no acute change.
.
Over the weekend on [**12-17**] and [**12-18**], his mental status remained
confused and agitated.  His morning temp was found to be 101.1
axillary, so blood and urine cultures were obtained.  A chest
XRay was repeated, and given his WBC count to 19, coarse lung
sounds, and fever, it was thought that the patient likely had a
pneumonia.  His was started on Vanc/Zosyn for coverage. In the
afternoon he developed increasing respiratory distress and
tachnypnea. He was transferred to the stepdown unit and diuresed
with lasix. Blood gas remained stable and and EKG as well as
CE's were ordered. Overnight he developed hypotension therefore
he was tranferred to the MICU.

CT HEAD STEREOTACTIC [**12-14**]
1. Redemonstration of right frontal and left parietal enhancing
lesions with resultant surrounding edema, most likely
representing metastatic disease however also could represent
lymphoma.
2. No evidence of midline shift or hydrocephalus.
.
CT HEAD POST-OP [**12-14**]
1. Mild pneumocephalus in the region around the biopsy of the
right frontal lobe mass. No evidence of hemorrhage.

CXR [**12-16**]:
No acute process

CXR [**12-17**]:
Lungs are clear.

LENIS:
No evidence of DVT.

CXR [**12-29**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight
increase in extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion. As
a consequence, the left retrocardiac atelectasis, resulting in
lung parenchymal consolidation, has also slightly increased.
Otherwise, there is no relevant parenchymal change. Unchanged
position of the right PICC line.


Brief Hospital Course:
Neurosurgical Course as above in HPI
====================================
MICU Course [**Date range (1) 88219**]
# Hypotension: Patient was thought to be hypovolemic from
pneumonia as well as diuresis in the step down unit. He was
given IVF with good result. BPs came up to the 120s systolic and
lactate trended down to 1.0 (from 3.4).
# Brain Lesions: Pathology result of brain biopsy revealed B
cell lymphoma. Oncology was consulted and recommended workup
including: SPEP, UPEP, LDH, HIV test, B2 microglobulin. They
also recommended consulting neuro-oncology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] for
further treatment options which will likely include MTX and XRT.
Patient was initially deferred for MTX because of pleural
effusion noted on CXR.
# PNA: given leukocytosis, fever, and increased work of
breathing with LLL infiltrate on CXR consistent with PNA.
Possibly aspiration given poor MS on other services. Continued
vanc/zosyn for planned 8day course (to end [**2168-12-24**]). Leukocytosis
trended down and tachypnea resolved.
# AMS: Patient was noted to be delirious on admission to MICU.
This was thought [**1-18**] infection, hypotension, and underlying
brain lesions. His MS improved with IVF and resolution of his
hypotension although he still remained somewhat disoriented,
worsening at night. Geriatrics followed the patient while
admitted and continues to follow.
=======================================
OMED Course: 85 yo M with hx of Emphysema, A Fib presenting with
confusion, found to have diffuse large B cell lymphoma of the
brain. Hospital stay complicated by delirium, LLL PNA,
hypotension and respiratory distress requiring transfer to MICU.
Transferred to OMED for continued management, and initiation of
MTX.
.
# DLBC CNS Lymphoma: Patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of
right frontal lesion on [**12-14**] showing DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL
LYMPHOMA. CSF flow cytometry showed non-specific T cell dominant
lymphoid profile. He was transferred to Medicine-Oncology
service for initiation of methotrexate therapy, which he
received [**2168-12-27**] and tolerated well except for mild mucositis.
For this he is on Gelclair TID. He had an EEG, which showed
encephalopathy. MRI spine was obtained on [**1-1**], read pending. He
is on Keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **], Decadron 2 mg daily, and prophylactic
daily Omeprazole. He will need a double lumen port placed and
eye exam done prior to his next admission for chemotherapy. He
will need to continue leucovorin and Na bicarbonate for one day
after discharge. He will need to take Na bicarbonate and collect
all of his urine for 24 hours prior to his next admission
(roughly two weeks from his first day of chemotherapy [**2168-12-27**]).
.
# Delirium/Encephalopathy: Likely multifactorial in etiology
infection, brain lesions, hospital environment. Improved during
his hospital course; however, patient remains confused, oriented
to self and general location. We provided frequent re-directing
and reassuring, was placed in a chair for his meals, and started
on Seroquel 37.5 mg nightly to restore his sleep-wake cycle.
.
# L Pleural Effusion: Likely transudative in setting of
receiving IV hydration with MTX protocol. Patient remained
afebrile, without leukocytosis. Received IV Lasix 10mg X2 with
subsequent good urine output and improvement in oxygenation. He
has only needed supplemental oxygen at night for the last two
days.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic. Hematocrit has been trending down. No
signs of bleeding. Stools were guaiac negative. Likely a
component of hemodilution secondary to IVFs. Also likely marrow
suppression from recent illness as retic count was 1.0. Was
transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on [**12-30**] with
appropriate response. This will need to be monitored in the
future.
.
# Transaminitis: Likely secondary to methotrexate therapy.
Patient had no right upper quadrant pain. His bilirubin was
within normal limits. There was no new medications coinciding
with the transaminase elevation. This will need to be monitored
in the fut
