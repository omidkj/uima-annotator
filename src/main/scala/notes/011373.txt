Brief Hospital Course:
GIB: Likely secondary to duodenal ulcer and supratherapeutic
INR. Patient is H. Pylori + - currently being treated.
- INR now wnl 1.3 (after FFP and Vit k)
- Follow serial hcts - on Dc stable
- iv ppi [**Hospital1 **]
- large bore ivs in place - Dc'd on discharge
- check coags each day.
- transfuse for a goal of >28
- volume resuscitate
- cont broad spectrum abx - Dc on discharge
- Hold Coumadin

AAA:  Endovascular stent graft repair of abdominal, tolerated
the procedure no complications. progressed with PT, recommended
rehab.

A fib : Pt on oral Diltiazem and coumadin  as out-pt. r/o with
enzymes. Cardiology consulted - before admission pt was on
coumadin.
CHADS score = 2 (HTN, age) therefore, risk of embolic CVA from
afib 4% per year. Given age, recent massive GIB, known PUD,
risks of restarting coumadin outweigh benefits.  [**Month (only) 116**] consider
restarting aspirin in future once PUD resolved, but would defer
at present.

EKG changes: in setting of hypotension/bleed. 2 sets CE's
negative. 1 Trop 0.04. Likely demand ischemia
