Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization x2
PCI to LAD and L-Cx


History of Present Illness:
53 year old male with hypertension p/w anterior STEMI and new
RBBB now s/p proximal LAD stent. Pt was in his USOH, working at
home in the morning. He was sitting at his desk when he started
to feel "uncomfortable" without specific complaints. Pt lied on
the sofa for about 15minutes without relief. He went upstairs
from his basement where he was working and started to c/o severe
Chest pain and significant SOB. Per pt's mother, pt lied on the
couch then lied on the floor as he could not get comfortable.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] mother called 911 and EMS arrived within 30minutes of onset
of severe CP. Pt did not take any medications for his pain. Per
EMS EKG strip noted ST elevations and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In ED
found to have new RBBB, ST elevations in V1-V6, ST depressions
in II, III, aVF. Pt c/o [**9-28**] CP in ED, received ASA, NTG x2 and
dropped his BP to 90/P, received 500cc IVF bolus with
improvement in BP to 138/102. He was started on Hep gtt, loaded
with Plavix 600mg and 4mg Morphine IV with symptomatic relief.
Pt was taken to the cath lab for immediate intervention.
In cath lab, pt found to have 90% thrombotic LAD lesion, had
3.0x18 cypher stent. Also with 80% mid-circumflex lesion which
was not stented. CO 3.23, CI 1.92. Wedge of 31, RA 11, PA 51/30
mean 39. O2 sats dropped to 76% on 6 liters, got lasix 20mg IV.
Sats improved, but htn, started on ntg gttp. No uop, foley
placed. Vagaled with foley placement, became hypotensive, ntg
d/c'd and given atropine. He responded, and then became htn
again, started back on low-dose ntg.
.
Pt with one prior h/o CP about 2.5 years ago while visiting
[**Country 11150**]. CP at that time was very minimal compared to current
presentation. Per physicians in [**Country 11150**] work up no CAD, negative
EKG. Pt has not had CP since then until current presentation. Pt
has a very sedentary lifestyle with minimal ambulation/activity.
He denies any DOE/SOB at rest, no orthopnea, no PND.

Pertinent Results:
[**2151-5-6**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature depolarizations. Right
bundle-branch block. Left axis deviation. Left anterior
fascicular block. Anterior wall myocardial infarction.
.
[**2151-5-6**] Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a codominant system.
The LMCA
was angiographically normal. The LAD had a proximal 95%
thrombotic
lesion with slow flow. The LCX had a 80% lesion at the takeoff
of a
large OM1. The small nondominant RCA was angiographically
normal.
2. Hemodynamics post intervention showed elevated left sided
filling
pressure (PCWP mean 35 mm Hg with V waves to 46 mm Hg). There
was
moderate pulmonary arteriolar hypertension (PASP 55 mm Hg) in
the
setting of an elevated PCWP. The cardiac index was depressed at
1.9.
3. Patient was hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure,
but was
hypoxic to an O2 sat of 84% on a nonrebreather. He was given 40
mg IV
lasix and started on IV nitroglycerine and his sat improved to
100% with
a couple of deep breaths.
4. Successful placement of 3.0 x 18 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent

postdilated with a 3.5 mm balloon in the proximal LAD for this
acute ST
elevation myocardial infarction. Final angiography demonstrated
no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and
normal
flow
.
[**2151-5-7**] Abd/Pelvis CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Patchy bilateral lower lobe opacities, worrisome for
aspiration. Atelectasis is a less likely possibility.
.
[**2151-5-7**] ECHO:
EF 40%
Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. Anterior, distal
septal and apical hypokinesis to akinesis is present.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
[**2151-5-10**] CXR PA&L:
The heart is upper limits of normal in size. There is upper zone
vascular redistribution and worsening perihilar haziness.
Additionally, there is an asymmetrical opacity at the right apex
at the level of the first anterior right rib and right clavicle.
On the lateral view, there is increased opacity overlying the
lower thoracic spine, corresponding to the posterior basilar
segments of the lower lobes. Additionally, the lungs appear
overinflated with flattening of the hemidiaphragms.
.
[**2151-5-10**] Chest CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Widespread pulmonary ground glass opacities, scattered foci
of consolidation and diffuse septal thickening. These findings
may represent pulmonary hemorrhage and/or pulmonary edema.
Infection is less likely.
2. Small pericardial effusion, slightly enlarged in comparison
to the previous film.
3. Bilateral small nonobstructing renal stones
.
[**2151-5-13**] C. Cath:
COMMENTS:
1.The lesion was predilated with a 2.5 X 12mm Voyager balloon,
stented
with a 3.5 X 18mm Cypher stent and post dilated with a 3.5 X
13mm High
sail balloon with lesion reduction from 80% to 0%. The final
angiogram
showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection
and no
embolisation. The patient left the lab in a stable condition.
2. left ventriculogram was performed in [**Doctor Last Name **] projection with 36
ml of
contrast at 12ml/sec. The entire anterior wall and the apex,
except for
a small area in the anterior basal segment was akinetic. the EF
was
30-35%.
.
Bivalirudin 45 mg bolus, 110 mg hr drip post cath
.
[**2151-5-13**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Right bundle-branch block
with left
anterior fascicular block. Q waves in the inferior leads with
minimal
ST segment elevation and terminal T wave inversion consistent
with acute
evolving myocardial infarction. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave
changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-5-13**] there is probably no
significant change.
