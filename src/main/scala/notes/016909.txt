Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, with RLE pain/edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left thoracentesis [**2160-7-25**]
Bronchoscopy [**2160-7-31**]

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83 year old Chinese/[**Month/Day/Year 8230**] speaking man
with HTN, Type II DM, ESRD on HD (T/T/S), transfered from
dialysis with reported pain and swelling of his RLE. History was
obtained from his son, records and translator.
.
Per patient he had been in his regular state of health, and
receiving dialysis on T/Th/Sa without complication. At dialysis
on day of admission, staff noted that his RLE was swollen, and
warm to palpation. Patient notes that it has been painful for a
few days. Denies any specific injury. Patient also said he has
felt warm, but no recorded fevers. He is somehwat confused on
exam, and it is difficult to tell how much of this is from
difficulty with translation, or baseline dementia.
.
In the ED initial VS were: T 100.6 HR 94 BP 178/58 RR 18 SpO2
94/2L.
On exam, he was noted to have RLE erythema, and 1+ DP pulse on
R, with discoloration and discoloration of the third toe.
Vascular surgery was called, and believed that this was related
to cellulitis. WBC 14.4, lactate 1.2, RLE U/S showed no DVT. CXR
showed a large L pleural effusion worse from prior study [**3-5**].
Patient was admitted to medicine for treatment of cellulitis. VS
on transfer HR 87 BP 162/57 Sp O2 98% on unknown O2.
.
ROS was otherwise positive for SOB, which patient feels at rest,
worsened by any activity. This is not new. ROS otherwise
negative. The pt denied recent unintended weight loss,
headaches, dizziness or vertigo, changes in hearing or vision,
neck stiffness, lymphadenopathy, hematemesis, coffee-ground
emesis, dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, steatorrhea, melena, hematochezia,
cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, orthpnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, leg pain while walking, joint pain.

Past Medical History:

Asthma
COPD

Social History:
Lives with caretaker (mainly [**Name (NI) 8230**] speaking only) who takes
care of him. Also has son who lives nearby and involved in his
care (occasionally goes to hemodialysis with him). Other son
lives out of state and is also involved in his care (visits him

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] is an 83-year-old chinese/[**Known lastname **]-speaking man with a
history of HTN, Type II DM, ESRD on HD, dCHF, COPD, and chronic
left pleural effusion who was admitted for dyspnea and RLE
pain/edema, underwent thoracentesis for large left pleural
effusion on [**7-25**], and had a PEA arrest during his hemodialysis
session on the morning of [**2160-7-26**]. He was transferred to the CCU
for further management.
.
# PEA arrest/respiratory failure: occurred in the setting of
rapidly worsening hypoxia after removing 1L at hemodialysis;
acute on chronic in etiology, as was requiring 4L at time of
admission. Also underwent left thoracentesis for 1.5L on evening
prior to arrest. DDx broad and included PE (unlikely given
improvement on vent following HD and no specific therapy),
tension pneumothorax (not present on CXR post intubation),
mucous plug, worsening pneumonia (there were new infiltrates
apparent on CXR), bronchospasm (long history of COPD), flash
pulmonary edema (given hypertensive episode and CXR
appearances), and worsening effusion, in te
