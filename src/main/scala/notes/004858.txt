Date of Birth:   [**2058-3-30**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain, shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male with
a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
obstructive sleep apnea, with a negative MIBI in [**2131-8-9**]
who presents with complaints of intermittent chest pain times
two days.  The patient was in his usual state of health until
two days ago when he noted waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mild chest
discomfort.  On the morning of admission, the patient was
lifting and object and noted "tugging" and resultant chest
pain of 8 out of 10, intermittently.  The patient then
developed radiation to his back and presented to the
Emergency Department.  At that point the pain was also
radiating to his right arm.  The patient described the pain
as "loaded with gas."  The patient endorses shortness of
breath, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, dizziness.  Patient
denied any nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, palpitations.  The
patient did note dyspnea on exertion.  He also had a chronic
dry cough.  No fever or chills.  The patient states that he
has had night sweats for years.  Last week, the patient had
anterior tibial burning in his left lower extremity.  He does
have a history of deep venous thrombosis.  The patient has
had normal p.o. intake.  He has taken all his blood pressure
medications.  The patient has no recent trauma, no falls, no
bright red blood per rectum or melena.

In the Emergency Department, the patient received 325 mg of
p.o. aspirin, Lopressor 5 mg IV times one, and one inch of
nitroglycerin paste.  The patient is presently chest pain
free without complaint of back pain.  The patient was also
given a half a liter of normal saline bolus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 74-year-old male with a
history of hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
negative MIBI of [**2131**] who presents with chest pain radiating
to the back.  The patient was initially on the C-MED service.
He was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction.  The
patient's enzymes were cycled and his triple CK peaked at
141, troponin peaked at 2.0.  Patient was scheduled for
stress test when he started developing substernal chest pain,
5 out of 10 on [**6-2**].  Electrocardiogram showed ST elevation
in the precordial leads.  Specifically, the patient had 5-[**Street Address(2) 104870**] elevations in leads V2 through V6.  He also had Q-waves
in leads V1 through V3 with loss of R-waves, and T-wave
inversions in V1 through V3 in addition to leads 2 and 3.
The patient was in atrial fibrillation at that point.  The
patient also dropped his pressure.  He was rushed to the
Catheterization Laboratory at this point.  In the lab,
patient was noted to have 100% total occlusion of the
proximal left anterior descending artery.  The lesion was
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied and stented
times one in addition to being treated with bivalirudin.  The
patient's right coronary artery and left circumflex arteries
were normal.  Patient's cardiac index was measured at 1.89.
For this reason, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
The patient's right atrial pressure was a mean of 16, RV of
48/10 and PA pressure of 49/30.  At this point, the patient
was admitted to the CCU.  On [**6-3**], the patient was noted to
be sundowning, found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response rate, increased respiratory rate and
hypoxia, with hypertension.  A total of 30 mg of intravenous
Lopressor were administered, but we were unable to control
the patient's rate or blood pressure.  EKG was unchanged with
ST elevations in V2 through 3.  At this point, the patient
was intubated, load with dig.  He was transiently
hypotensive.  A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained.
This showed an ejection fraction of 25-30%.  He had normal
cavity size, severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal akinesis of the entire septum, distal
two-thirds of the anterior wall, distal inferior wall and
apex.  The remaining segments contracted well.

1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was placed on a
regimen of aspirin, Plavix times nine months for his vent, in
addition to Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.  The patient was also
started on beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.  However, through
the patient's hospitalization, he would have difficulty
maintaining his blood pressure.  In addition, the patient
became bradycardic in response to carvedilol.  The patient's
maximum carvedilol dose was 18.75 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Once the
patient's blood pressure problems were under control, he was
restarted on Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.  However, the patient
became bradycardic into the high 30's on [**2132-6-23**], in
addition to dropping his systolic blood pressure into the low
80's.  For this reason we are holding beta blocker and ACE at
this point.  Hopefully in the near future both of these can
be restarted.  Patient would have no further significant EKG
changes.  There was no suspicion for any further ischemic
changes.  Patient did not have any further episodes of chest
pain through his hospitalization.

2.  Pump:  After the patient's echocardiogram on [**2132-6-3**], the patient was felt to be volume overloaded.  He was
diuresed with 40 mg of intravenous Lasix.  His blood pres
