HAND, AP & LAT. VIEWS LEFT   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 61027**]
Reason: TRAUMA, (P) LEFT HAND, AMPUTATION
 LEFT HAND, FRONTAL VIEWS: Radiographs are obtained separately
of the
patient's distal left upper extremity and the amputated left
hand. There is amputation with straight edge through the distal
carpal row. Along the distal portion of the left upper
extremity, the distal carpal bones are displaced. Bandaging
material and presumed tourniquet are noted. No definite retained
radiopaque foreign body is seen.
IMPRESSION: Status post amputation of the left hand through the
distal carpal row.










Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Plastics consulted
urgently for the left hand amputation and he was taken to the
operating room for revision of the left hand  amputation. There
were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively from a
hemodynamic perspective his blood pressure has remained stable
and his hematocrit is stable at 33.3 with no evidence of any
acute bleeding from his injury site. His wound is currently
covered with xeroform and ABD pad.

Psychiatry was also consulted early on. He was placed on 1:1
supervision; CIWA scale was implemented. It was recommended that
patient be hospitalized in an inpatient mental health facility
once medically cleared.

During his stay he was noted with intermittent low oxygen
saturations and required supplemental oxygen; his saturations
were noted to drop to high 80's% without any symptoms of
shortness of breath or dyspnea. A Pulmonary consult was obtained
at the request of Psychiatry because of concerns over his low
saturations and his medical clearance for transfer to an
inpatient psychiatric facility. It was felt that he likely had
some pulmonary edema and recommended diuresis with Lasix which
was successful. It was also felt that he was likely having a
COPD flare and a 5 day course with Prednisone 40 mg was ordered.
At time of this dictation he has 1 day left to complete the full
course. His oxygen was eventually weaned off with initial
saturations in the low 90's%. His PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 44170**] was contact[**Name (NI) **]
to find out more about his past medical history; he notes that
patient has a greater than 30 year history of tobacco use [**1-23**]
ppd and that he does have a diagnosis of COPD/emphysema and that
his baseline resting saturations run in low 90's. Of note during
ambulation his saturations have dropped to 88-91% without any
symptoms of shortness of breath/dyspnea or tachypnea. From this
standpoint he is deemed medically stable for transfer to an
inpatient psychiatric facility.
