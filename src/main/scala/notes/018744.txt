History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo Russain speaking M with history of CAD s/p CABG, COPD, CHF
(EF 30-35%) and recent MICU admission for PNA, sepsis requiring
intubation, now presenting with SOB, tachypnea, temperature to
102F with desaturation to 79% on room air.  His saturation
improved to 97% with a non rebreather and he was then
transferred to the ED from NH.  Per pt's son, [**Name (NI) **], the pt has
been more SOB and not tolerating po's over the past 2 days at
[**Hospital3 2558**].  He was recently admitted [**2182-6-24**] for aspiration
PNA and sepsis requiring intubation. He failed swallow study at
that time but was d/c'd to rehab reportedly tolerating po's.  In
the ED, the pt was febrile to 102F and given lasix 20mg iv x 1
for slight CHF on CXR. ABG on 70% FM was 7.38/45/60 and BP was
borderline low.  The patient was started on ceftriaxone, flagyl
and azithromycin.  He was admitted to the unit for close
monitoring of blood pressure and pulmonary function.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was treated with flagyl, azithro, and
ceftriaxone to cover both aspiration and nursing home acquired
pneumonia.  He failed a trial of 5L nasal cannulae with
desaturation, but showed improvement on 40% FIO2 by facemask.
Chest PT was performed with emphasis to the site of the left
lower lobe pneumonia.  He was supported with bronchodilators and
steroids with a plan to wean his steroids only if he required a
prolonged duration of therapy.  A discussion was undertaken
about the benefit of NG tube placement with transition to PEG,
in order to limit future aspiration events.  A discussion was
undertaken with the daughter and son, who agreed that this
procedure could be performed pending the patient's approval and
with the assurance of speech and swallow that the patient's
dysphagia would not improve with a temporary rest from
swallowing.  The patient decided to take time to think about
whether or not to have the PEG placed, but agreed to placement
of an NG tube in the interim.  He did have new EKG changes in
V5/V6 with tachycardia.  This resolved after fluid resuscitation
and resoution of tachycardia.  A CXR was not impressive for
signs of pulmonary edema.  Fluids were otherwise kept even with
lasix as needed to prevent volume overload.  The patient
appeared to have a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with
no anion gap.  He is perhaps unable to compensate with this
acute insult in light of his COPD and moderate renal
insufficiency.

The patient was transferred to the medicine floor [**9-18**] and later
that day developed acute respiratory distress with sat 90% on a
nonrebreather mask, respiratory acidosis, and hypotension with
BP90/50 likely due to repeat aspiration He was intubated and
returned to the ICU on the same day.  He was bradycardic HR 48,
thrombocytopenic, and had digitalis toxicity. Digitalis was
permanently discontinued and thought to be the cause of the
bradycardia. Beta blockade was temporarily held for bradycardia.
The patient completed a 5 day course of stress dose steroids for
hypotension and klebsiella, enterobacter bacteremia. He received
dopamine for the hypotension and bradycardia. The patient did
well after extubation on [**9-23**] and he returned to the medicine
floor without hemodynamic instability or respiratory distress.

He was readmitted to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic
respiratory failure due to aspiration, and also suffered severe
hypotension with suspected sepsis.
In ICU pt continued to be hypercarbic despite attempts at
multiple ventilator settings and O2 saturations hovered in the
high 80's. He continued to be hypotesive despite max dose
vasopressin and norepinephrine and required frequent normal
saline boluses. Pt developed acute on chronic renal failure and
became anasacic due to multiple fluid boluses resulting and
diffuse skin breakdown along with digit dry gangrene due to
vasopressors. A family meeting was called and it was decided
that the pt would be made CMO. The pt was given morphine as
needed to make respiration comfortable and he was removed from
the ventilator on [**10-15**] and pt expired the next morning.
