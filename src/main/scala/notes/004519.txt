[**2126-9-13**] CXR

Large postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable since
the earliest films, postoperative films on [**9-10**]. Small
right pleural effusion has decreased since [**9-10**]. Mild
bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left is probably not
clinically significant. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.

[**2126-9-10**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is an
inferobasal/inferoseptal left ventricular aneurysm. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with above focal
abnormalities. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened(most at the distal anterior
leaflet. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. A very prominent chord attaches to the base of the
anterior leaflet causing probable anterior leaflet retraction.
The posterior leaflet appears retracted as well Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
The patient is receivihng milrinone at 0.375 ucg/kg/min Overall
LV systolic function appears improved in the setting of
inotropes.
(LVEF~45%) There is a well seated well functioning bioprosthesis
in the mitral position. There is a mild perivalvular leak
anteriorly located. The remaining study is unchanged compared to
prebypass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2126-9-10**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease and mitral valve
regurgitation. He was taken directly to the operating room where
he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels and
a mitral valve replacement with a 29 mm Biocor porcine valve.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac intensive care unit
for monitoring. By postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was awake,
neurologically intact and extubated. Gentle diuresis was
initiated. Aspirin was resumed. His blood pressure was slightly
labile postoperatively which required pressors until
postoperative day three. He was then transferred to the step
down unit for further recovery. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He developed some paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which
responded to repleting his electrolytes. Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained
of some left thigh numbness which was present prior to his
surgery. The neurology service was consulted who suspected that
his symptoms most likely represented meralgia paresthetic which
is pressure or
contraction of the cutaneous nerve at the thigh that is from
either position, obesity or tight undergarments among other
possibilities. It was felt that this would improve with
mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on postoperative day five. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician
as an outpatient.
