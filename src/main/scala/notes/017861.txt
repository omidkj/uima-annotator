Allergies:
Keflex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheobronchomalacia with severe COPD admit for increasing
shortness of breath, possible Y-stent placement.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2194-8-9**] Bronchoscopy, with therapeutic aspiration.
[**2194-8-7**] Rigid bronchoscopy, Y stent placement.
[**2194-7-30**] Flexible bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with multiple medical
problems including COPD on home O2 and tracheobronchomalacia who
presents today for progressive dyspnea over the last year.  The
patient was evaluated in [**2193-5-24**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and had bronchoscopy, which demonstrated significant
tracheobronchomalacia.  She underwent Y-stent placement in [**Month (only) **]
[**2192**].  The stent was in place for approximately two weeks before
it was removed due to increased coughing and mucous production.
The patient could not tolerate the stent.  The patient followed
up on [**2194-8-5**] for reevaluation given that her shortness of
breath has increased from baseline, her mobility is fairly
significantly limited now.
Her previous use of home O2 has now increased to 24 hours a day,
3 liters nasal cannula.  She uses CPAP at night. She is referred
by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation for possible re-stenting versus
other surgical procedures.

Physical Exam:
general: Obese white female in NAD wearing 4 liters of oxygen
continuously
HEENT: unremarkable
Cor: RRR S1, S2 w/ mech mitral valve
Chest: Course breath sounds that clear w/ coughing. occas
wheezes.
Abd: large, round, soft, NT, +BS
Extrem: no edema
Neuro: intact

Pertinent Results:
Video swallow [**2194-8-12**]:
Pt appears safe from oropharyngeal standpoint for return to a PO
diet of regular solids and thin liquids.  She does not require
chin tuck maneuver at this time.  She tolerates whole pills with
thin liquids.  Pt may wish to have assistance with set up for
meals/cutting meats, etc, but does not require 1:1 supervision
with meals for swallow safety.  Maintain standard aspiration
precautions.  Please reconsult if there are further concerns for
aspiration or other oropharyngeal dysphagia.

This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 6, WFL.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet: regular solids, thin liquids

2. PO meds whole with thin liquids

3. Assist with meal set up as needed.  Pt may require assistance
with cutting foods, etc.  Does not require 1:1 supervision with
meals.

4. Maintain standard aspiration precautions.

5. Consider further w/u of coughing during meals not associated
with aspiration and/or c/o GERD to level of pharynx during
today's evaluation.  In addition, pt has c/o food getting
"stuck"
at the level of the sternum, even prior to admit.

6. Reconsult if there are further concerns for aspiration or
other oropharyngeal dysphagia.

CXR [**2194-8-11**]:
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with known
tracheobronchomalacia and right lower lung pneumonia.

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2194-8-10**].

The cardiomegaly with bulging of the pulmonary trunk is stable.
There is no
change in the position of the mitral valve. There is no
appreciable change in
the right lower lobe and left perihilar opacities as well. There
is no
increase in pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.

ECHO: [**2194-8-12**]
Conclusions
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. The transmitral gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with normal global systolic function.
A focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded. Mitral valve
prosthesis with at least mild mitral regurgitation and normal
gradients.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-3-28**], the
findings are similar. The pulmonary artery systolic pressures
were not estimated on the prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**8-5**] to the Interventional
Pulmonology service for treatment of her increasing shortness of
breath due to COPD and evaluation for possible placement of a
Y-stent for tracheobroncialmalacia. On [**8-7**], she had a Y-stent
placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and therapeutic aspiration.

She experienced acute exacerbation of her COPD after placement
of her Y-stent and was admitted to the ICU.

Steroids started, on a 14 day taper down to baseline of 5mg PO
daily.

Admitted to floor from ICU for ongoing pulmonary care.
Pt w/ repeated episode of diarrhea- C-diff toxin neg. Bowel
regimen tapered.

BAL grew out MRSA that was sensitive to Bactrim.  Vancomycin
d/c'd.
Will complete a 2 week course of Bacrtim on [**2194-8-23**].

Pt's coumadin was resumed at lower dose than home regimen as she
is on bactrim which will elevate her INR.

[**8-9**] therapeutic bronchoscopy; mid-trachea proximal end of
silicone Y-stent minimal granulation tissue, extensive amount of
mucus secretions in Y-stent successfully
suctioned through the bronchoscope, distal end of the stent
bilaterally with minimal amount of granulation tissue.

[**8-12**] passed video swallow: [**Last Name (un) 1815**] reg diet w/ thin liquids and
meds whole w/o difficulty.

Pt had loose stool x 3days and C-diff toxin A+B were negative
x3. Pt was placed on lactose free diet and imodium.

 The patient is on maximal medical therapy for COPD with
inhalers as well as prednisone.  Recommendation would be to
continue her medications as prescribed at this time. She remians
on CPAP at night for sleep apnea
