Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation (from OSH)
Mechanical Ventilation
Central Venous Line Placement (from OSH)
Arterial Line Placement
Upper endoscopy x 2

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 21F with h/o bulemia, ETOH abuse, Cirrhosis
secondary to her eating disorder with known varices who presents
from [**Hospital6 3105**] with acute upper GI bleed.  HPI
is taken from records and mother as patient is intubated and
unable to provide history.

The mother states that the patient was feeling unwell on the day
of admission.  Her friend had died a few nights before and she
was spending time with her friends consuming unknown quantities
of EtOH.  She denied any f/c, HA, abd pain during this time.
However, she was very fatigued and complained of shortness of
breath.  Her mother also noted her to be slightly yellow at this
time.  She spent most of the day in bed, but became nauseated
and vomitted black "clots."  As far as the mother knows there
was no bloody stool prior.  She was then taken to the ED at LGH.

At LGH, she nearly collapsed on arrival.  Her initial VS were T
99.8, BP 111/52, HR 130.  Labs notable for Hct 10.2, Plt 65, INR
1.5.  She also had EtOH 160, [**Doctor First Name **] 294 and AST/ALT 122/26.
Patient was transferred to the ICU and given 4 units PRBCs.  She
subsequently went into respiratory arrest with CXR showing
diffuse opacities.  She was intubated at 0215 on [**2-26**] and
sedated with propofol and versed.  She then underwent EGD
showing portal gastropathy, long grade III varix with red [**Last Name (un) 23199**]
sign -> banded x3.  There was also a grade II varix noted,
banded x1.  She was put on octreotide, PPI and volume
resuscitated.  Repeat Hct at 21.  Pt also underwent presumed TTE
with EF 15% (no documentation here).  In the afternoon of
transfer, ABG 7.45/32/68.  Fi02 increased to 80%.  Pt also
spiked temp to 103 given tylenol and cooling blanket.
Vancomycin was given prior to transfer.

On arrival, the patient is intubated and sedated with propofol
and versed.  She is on neosynephrine as well as levophed with
SBP 90s.

Past Medical History:
1. Bulemia Nervosa
2. EtOH Abuse
3. Cirrhosis -> thought secondary to eating disorder.  Has had
liver biopsy on [**2167-10-22**]: macrovesicular steatosis with rare
hyalin. There is marked bridging fibrosis.  No feature of
autoimmune hepatitis.

Social History:
Lives at home with mother.  Recently drinking EtOH with friends
over the past few days, unknown quantities.  + toabacco, <1ppd.
Per mother, no h/o recreational drug use otherwise.

Family History:
Significant for multiple members with DM and HTN. No known
thyroid dz, autoimmune dz (Lupus, UC, crohn's etc), no liver dz
or other GI problems.

IMAGING OSH:
CXR [**2-26**]: Diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities, ETT 2cm
from carina, NG tube in place
.
RUQ U/S: Mild/mod ascites, GB with thickened wall, small
pericholecystic fluid, small layer of tiny stones, no CBD
dilatation.
.
EKG: Sinus tachy at 120s, nl axis and intervals, non-specific ST
changes in the setting of tachycardia.
.
CXR [**2-26**] on arrival: ETT ~3cm from carina, L subclavian projects
over SVC.  Cardiomegaly with bilateral alveolar opacities.
Sharp costophrenic angles, prominant stomach bubble, no
abdominal free air appreciated.
[**2-27**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30%),
without regionality to the wall motion abnormalities (consistent
with global process: infectious, toxic, metabolic, etc.)
Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation. The right
ventricular cavity is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. A
central jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen, likely stemming from mitral annular dilatation. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild global right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small
pericardial effusion

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2168-2-28**] 9:10 AM
Reason: Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia, volume overload
Field of view: 36
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
21 year old woman with cardiomyopathy and cirrhosis now with
likely sepsis and CXR with pneumonia vs. ARDS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia, volume overload
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST
INDICATION: 21-year-old woman with cardiomyopathy and cirrhosis
and ARDS. Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia, volume overload.
COMPARISON: Not available.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the chest were obtained without
intravenous contrast. Coronal reformatted images were obtained.
FINDINGS: There are extensive consolidative and ground-glass
opacities, involving lung fields bilaterally, with sparing of
the periphery. The ground- glass opacities are predominantly
distributed in the nondependent portion and consolidated
opacities are in dependent portions of the perihilar regions.
There are small pleural effusions. The airways are patent. There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no pathologically
enlarged mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes.
Non-contrast evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates small
amount of free intraperitoneal fluid. The liver is decreased in
attenuation, consistent with fatty infiltration.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Confluent bilateral parenchymal opacities, most severe
dependently, in a pattern suggestive of ARDS. The possibility of
superimposed or pre-exisiting pneumonia is difficult to exclude
given the severity of the parenchymal findings.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Cardiomegaly.
4. Fatty liver infiltration.
