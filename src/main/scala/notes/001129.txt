2.0), mildly elevated BNP, and crit of 21.5, down from a
baseline of 30.  Pt was guiac negative on exam.  CXR showed
retrocardiac opacity, possibly pleural effussion.

PERTINENT STUDIES
[**12-14**] CT chest/abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of thoracic aortic aneurysm without
evidence of hematoma in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, as
questioned.
2. Splenomegaly and prominence of the left hepatic lobe,
findings that
suggest the possibility of background liver disease. Correlation
with LFTs is recommended.
3. Biapical and left lower lobe nodular pulmonary densities, for
which
followup with chest CT is recommended in one year if there are
risk factors for lung cancer.
4. Aortic and mitral valve replacement with biatrial enlargement
and findings again consistent with pulmonary artery
hypertension.
5. Fat-containing umbilical and left inguinal hernias.
.
[**12-16**] EGD
[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear
Blood in the body of stomach
Erythema in the stomach
Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**12-16**] Colonoscopy
Melanosis coli in the colon
Polyp in the colon
.
[**12-16**] Duodenal biopsy
Duodenum, biopsy (A): Duodenal mucosa within normal limits.
.
[**12-24**] CXR
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-14**], there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with aortic
and mitral
valve replacement and CABG procedure. Opacification at the base
posteriorly is consistent with pleural effusion, more prominent
on the left. Volume loss is again seen in the region of the left
lower lobe. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
.
[**12-26**] single ballon enteroscopy
Normal esophagus.
Normal stomach.
Normal duodenum.
There was one small area with active bleeding seen in the
proximal jejunum. The base of the bleeding was not able to be
well visualized because of the active bleeding and clots. It is
suspicious for AVM or Dieulafoy lesion.  It was first treated
with cauterization with a gold probe. Then it was injected with
1:10,000 epinephrine. Three hemoclips were placed successfully
with good hemostasis.
SPOT tattoo was applied on either side of the bleeding area for
future localization
.
[**12-29**] KUB
IMPRESSION: Single focally dilated loop of small bowel with wall
thickening and two clips within the lumen, which likely
represents a focal ileus in the area of the recent AVM clipping.
