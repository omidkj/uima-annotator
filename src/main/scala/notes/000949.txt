shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] is a 52yo male with a past medical history of
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 30%-35%), insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C infection, HTN, HLD,
schizophrenia and depression who is presenting in acute
respiratory distress after recent admission to the MICU/Gen med
([**Date range (1) 63644**]) for similar presentation. The patient reports that he
was smoking crack cocaine earlier 2 days ago began to have chest
pain and progressive shortness of breath over the past 2 days.
He also reports worsening of productive cough (white sputum)
which has been present since his discharge from the hospital on
[**1-21**]. He says that he felt that he never truly returned to his
baseline after his last hospitalization. He says that he has had
worsening orthopnea, with use of 3 pillows instead of his usual
2 last night. He denies edema, PND. He denies fevers/chills or
other URI sx, chest pain/pressure, pleuritic pain. He has had a
VNA and reports that his weight has decreased from 183 to 180,
he has avoided salt in his diet and he has been fully compliant
with this medications. He does think that the crack that he
smoked 2 days ago had "less baking soda in it." The patient also
does have a past medical history of MRSA pna requiring
tracheostomy.
.
He also had admission from [**2112-12-8**] in which he was intubated
and CT showed multifocal pneumonia. Because the radiographic
evidence of this pneumonia cleared quickly within 2 weeks, it
was felt that this was crack lung as opposed to infectious. He
was treated with broad spectrum abx and his respiratory status
returned to baseline. During his admission [**Date range (1) 63644**], the patient
was felt to have crack lung/hypersensitivity pneumonitis given
parenchymal abnormality seen on chest CT, he was treated with
one dose of methylprednisone 125mg but had hyperglycemia
requiring insulin gtt and was thus not treated with steroids. He
did not receive antibiotics. There may have been a component of
CHF during this presentation and the patient was treated with
lasix gtt during this prior admission.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  RR 40s, O2 Sat: 75% on NRB. The
patient received nitro gtt, was placed on BiPap with dramatic
improvement. The patient was also treated with levofloxacin and
vancomycin. He received lasix 40mg IV x1, aspirin and tylenol
1000mg po. Blood cultures were obtained.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is still tachypneic but
completing full sentences. He is alert, oriented and does not
appear in acute distress.
.

MICROBIOLOGY DATA:

[**2196-1-29**] Urine legionella - negative
.
IMAGING:
[**2196-1-30**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - In addition to a severe
infiltrative abnormality, with probable confluence in the lung
bases, there are many small discrete nodular opacities, which
have grown appreciably since [**1-28**], probably entirely new
since [**1-18**]. Pattern strongly suggests widespread
infection, possibly septic emboli. Heart is moderately enlarged,
unchanged. At least small bilateral pleural
effusions are presumed.

Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION: 52M with a PMH significant for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (LVEF 30%-35%), insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, hepatitis C infection, HTN, HLD, schizophrenia and
depression with recent hospitalization for crack lung, who
presented with acute hypoxic respiratory distress found to have
bilaterally diffuse airspace opacification with suspected
component of CHF exacerbation, in the setting of recent illicit
substance use.
