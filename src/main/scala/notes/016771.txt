Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23440**] was admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
on [**2195-7-23**].  He underwent insertion of an intra-aortic balloon
pump preoperatively to improve his hemodynamics and had an
ultrasound of his carotid arteries which showed a [**Country **]
60-69%lesion and [**Doctor First Name 3098**] 40-59% lesion.  He was taken to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**7-24**] and underwent a CABGx3,
LIMA-LAD, SVG-Ramus, SVG-OM.  Please see operative note for full
details. He was transfered to the ICU in stable condition.  The
IABP was removed on POD#1.  He developed increasing agitation
over the next few days and was started on ativan due to the
concerns for alcohol withdrawal.  He remained on a milrinone
drip to support his hemodynamics, and continued to be
hemodynamically labile for several days.  He was weaned and
extubated from mechanical ventilation on POD#5. He developed
rapid atrial fibrillation which responded to amiodarone with
conversion to normal sinus rhythm.  He underwent a slow
milrinone wean, was started on captopril for afterload reduction
and the milrinone was eventually discontinued on POD#7 with
contnued good hemodynamics.  He was transfered from the ICU to
the step down unit on POD#9 and was cleared for discharge to
rehab on POD#12.
