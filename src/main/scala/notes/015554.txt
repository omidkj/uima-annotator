Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheobronchomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage
and aspiration; right thoracotomy with tracheoplasty with
mesh, right main-stem bronchus and bronchus intermedius
bronchoplasty with mesh, and left main-stem bronchus
bronchoplasty with mesh

History of Present Illness:
56-year-old woman
who has COPD and also severe diffuse tracheobronchomalacia.
She underwent a Y-stent trial and had a remarkable
improvement in her dyspnea with the stent in place.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 80906**] does have significant COPD, and prior to the
operation, a long discussion was held with her in regard tothe
fact that we would only be fixing the central airways with a
stabilization via tracheobronchoplasty, but we would certainly
not be improving her lung function.  In addition, given her
quite impaired lung function, we were concerned that she might
have some more difficulty getting through an
operation of this magnitude.  Nonetheless, she wished to
proceed, and given the fact that her stent trial was as
remarkably positive as it was, we elected to proceed.


Past Medical History:
COPD, high cholesterol, ?OSA, HH/reflux,
hypothyroid, distant seizure history, DM2

Social History:
She is married and lives with her husband.  She has taken
voluntary retirement due to her respiratory problems.  She
denied any consumption of alcohol.  She is an ex-smoker who quit
8 years ago having accumulated at least 30-pack years
smoking.


Family History:
Father died of silicosis.  Mother died of ischemic heart
disease.
