Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 80571**] is a 68 y/o woman with PMH notable for severe
kyphoscoliosis, reactive airway disease, and chronic diastolic
CHF who presents to the ED with increased dyspnea. Patient
reports increased dyspnea for the past several days which
progressively worsened on the day of admission. She laid in bed
most of the day and when she finally got out of bed, she noted
severe dyspnea and came to the ED. She reports no dietary
indiscretion (she did the [**Holiday 1451**] cooking) and has not
missed any of her lasix doses. She denies any fever, chills,
cough, sputum production, or hemoptysis. Of note the patient was
recently changed from verapamil 120 mg daily (started two months
ago) to diltiazem 120 mg daily due to increased dyspnea. She
states that when she originally started verapamil, she had more
dyspnea and this has been stable for the past few months.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were T97.7, BP 111/56, HR
92, RR 28. She was found to have an oxygen saturation of 45% in
with solumedrol 125 mg IV X 1 as well as stacked
albuterol/atrovent nebs. CXR demonstrated small bilateraly
effusions and ? hilar fullness (poor film). Saturations quickly
improved to 93-94% on 6L NC with nebs. She was then treated with
lasix 60 mg IV X 1 after CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema. She
was noted to drop her oxygen saturations to 86% on 4 L NC when
nebs were completed. At the time of transfer, her oxygen
saturations were 89-91% on 3 L NC (home oxygen).
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient reports that her breathing is
improved. She denies any chest pain. She chronically sleeps with
her head elevated due to her reflux disease; she states she
wakes from sleep short of breath "sometimes" but has not noted
this any more frequently lately. She reports some decreased
urine output for the past few days but denies any recent chest
pain or diaphoresis. She denies dysuria, headache, nasal
congestion, sore throat, abdominal pain, hematuria, or increased
LE edema. She had one episode of diarrhea in the past few days
after taking laxatives.

Studies:
[**2164-12-9**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2162-11-24**] no change.

[**2164-12-9**] CXR - IMPRESSION:
1. CHF, bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Retrocardiac opacity, which could represent a combination of
atelectasis and hiatal hernia. Cannot rule out consolidation. A
repeat study after appropriate treatment is recommended.

[**2164-12-10**] CXR - IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Mild congestive failure. Cardiomegaly.

[**2164-12-10**] Echo - Impression:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-5-9**],
the right ventricular cavity is now dilated with more prominent
free wall hypokinesis. Right ventricular pressure overload is
now suggested, though the estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is similar.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 80571**] is a 68 year old woman with a past medical history
notable for severe kyphoscoliosis, diastolic CHF, and reactive
and restrictive lung disease who presented with shortness of
breath and a CHF exacerbation.

# Shortness of breath / acute on chronic CHF: The patient
requires 3L O2 at home to maintain O2 sats 88-92% and desats
with ambulation at baseline.  She required additional
supplemental O2 on presentation to the ED.  EKG showed no
evidence of new ischemia and cardiac enzymes x 2 were negative.
She had an elevated BNP of 7885, CXR with bilateral pleural
effusions, and ECHO with worsened RVH.  She was initially
admitted to the MICU and while there improved clinically with
nebulized bronchodilators and diuresis with IV lasix.  She was
transfered to the general medical floor on [**12-11**] and had a good
diuresis with 40 mg IV lasix.  By the following morning her
resting O2 saturation and requirement had returned to her
baseline and she reported feeling much better.

# Acute renal failure: Creatinine was elevated to 1.7 on
admission and initially felt to be related to poor forward flow
in setting of initiation of diltiazem and/or CHF exacerbation.
The patient had not taken any extra naproxen, but did report
decreased PO intake prior to admission.  Her creatinine improved
with diuresis.  Lisinopril and naproxen were held while her
creatinine remained elevated.

# Hypernatremia: On admisison the patient reported one episode
of diarrhea after taking laxatives during the week prior, but
otherwise no good explanation for hypernatremia. She has
continued her usual lasix prescription as directed by her
physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved during MICU stay w
