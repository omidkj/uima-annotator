MRI [**2115-12-31**]: Left frontal extra-axial mass most likely a
meningioma.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2116-1-3**] 9:20 AM
IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative changes without acute
hemorrhage, edema or infarction.

EEG Study Date of [**2116-1-6**]
IMPRESSION: This is a normal portable EEG in the waking and
drowsy
states. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing. There
were no
epileptiform features. No electrographic seizures were recorded.
Of
note, the faster beta frequency rhythms are likely related to
medication
effects from benzodiazepine administration.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt started initially on decadron with surrounding edema around
mass.  Mass resected via Left sided frontotemporal craniotomy on
[**2116-1-1**], which patient tolerated well.  However, on POD1, pt
noted to be significantly agitated/striking at staff.  As a
result, pt was sedated and intubated.  He continued to be
significantly agitated/not responsive to commands on POD2-3.  On
POD3, he was noted to have PNA, likely aspiration related, for
which he was started on vancomycin/zosyn for coverage.
Psychiatry was consulted as well and recommended haldol PRN,
which he started with improvement in agitation.

He was able to follow simple commands with decreased agitation.
however, on POD5, he was noted to have 5 second episode of R eye
turn/head turn with bilateral UE shaking.  Dilantin level 10.1
(corrected) at that time.  Neurology consulted and recommend
goal level 15-20.  pt was given 500 mg x 1. EEG demonstrated
normal results.

Pt was extubated on POD 5 which the patient tolerated well.
with seizure activity, psychiatry was contact[**Name (NI) **] with haldol's
lowering of seizure threshold.  Psychiatry recommended change to
Ativan. In addition his Dilantin was changed to Keppra.
On [**2116-1-7**] he was transfered to stepdown unit, and speech therapy
was ordered, and recommended treatment between 5 - 7 weeks. On
[**2116-1-8**] and [**2116-1-9**] his speech has greatly improved, he did not
have any word finding difficulties, and his speech was fluent
without dysarthria.
