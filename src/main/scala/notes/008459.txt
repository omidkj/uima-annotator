Admission Date: [**2118-9-19**]        Discharge Date: [**2118-10-3**]

Service:  NB


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 57586**] is a female
born at 39 and 3/7 weeks gestation to a 30 year old, Gravida
IV, Para I now II mother with prenatal screens blood type A
positive, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune,
hepatitis B surface antigen negative, GBS negative.
Pregnancy was complicated by a prenatal echo showing complex
congenital heart disease, first noted at seven weeks. In
particular, this showed a right ventricle that was smaller
than the left, small mitral valve, small to moderate
ventricular septal defect, left sided superior vena cava
which ends in the coronary sinus with a dilated coronary
sinus.  Pregnancy was also complicated by pneumonia in the
mother shortly prior to delivery, for which she was treated
with Zithromax at the time of delivery. She had spontaneous
onset of labor with rupture of membranes 24 hours prior to
delivery and clear fluid.  There was no evidence of maternal
fever and no intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.  The baby
developed a non reassuring fetal heart tracing so she was
delivered by urgent cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.
She emerged with a spontaneous cry and a heart rate greater
than 100.  She was resuscitated only with blow-by oxygen,
warming, suction and stimulation.  Apgars were seven and
eight.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, birth weight was 2400
grams (less than 10th percentile); length 46 cm (15th
percentile); head circumference 32.5 cm (25th percentile).
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT examination was notable for
a flat and soft anterior fontanel with bilateral red reflexes
present and an intact palate.  Chest had clear and equal
breath sounds with minimal intercostal retractions.  Her
heart had a regular rate and rhythm with no appreciable
murmur and 1 plus brachial and femoral pulses.  Abdomen
revealed a three vessel cord, soft, no hepatosplenomegaly or
mass.  Her back had no clefts, [**Hospital1 **] or dimples.  Extremities
had stable hips.  Genitourinary examination revealed normal
external female genitalia.  Her skin was pale.  She had
normal tone and reflexes.

Chest x-ray revealed diffusely hazy lungs and a normal
cardiothymic silhouette.  An initial arterial blood gases was
7.39; PC02 of 31; P02 58 in room air.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 57586**] was
initially in room air and remained so throughout her first
ten days of life.  She was noted to have occasional
tachypnea.  Chest x-ray revealed increasingly hazy lungs,
which were attributed to some mild congestive heart failure
from her known ventricular septal defect.  She was treated
with Lasix as described below.  She was also noted to have
coarse crying with a hoarse and wheezing cough from the time
of birth.  This was evaluated by flexible laryngoscopy by the
otolaryngologist, who noted normal vocal cord movement and no
specific abnormalities above the vocal cords.  She was
subsequently evaluated with
a swallow study which did not show laryngeal cleft or H-type
fistula but was concerning for gross aspiration of thin and
thick liquids.  On day of life 11, [**9-30**], she had a
seizure (most likely due to hypocalcemia due to previously
undiagnosed hypoparatand seemed to develop increasing
uequence -  clinical diagnosis

 Infant also had increasing respiratory distress. She was
started on nasal cannula oxygen at that
time, 400 cc flow in 40 percent.  She had gradually
increasing respiratory distress over the course of the week-
end, despite extra doses of Lasix.  On the morning of
transfer, [**10-3**], she developed cardiac gallop, poor
perfusion, increased tachypnea to
greater than 100 with intercostal retractions and gasping
respirations.  Blood gas at that time had a pH of 7.29 with a
C02 of 48.  She was then intubated with a 3.5 endotracheal
tube to a depth of 9 cm.  Chest x-ray confirmed placement.
She is currently on SIMV with peak inspiratory pressure of
25; PEEP of 5 cm, rate of 25 and 50 percent.  Arterial blood
gases on these studies showed a pH of 7.36 with a PC02 of 43
and P02 of 51.

Cardiovascular:  The infant's initial postnatal echo
confirmed the presence of two ventricular septal defects with
a left sided superior vena cava emptying into the coronary
sinus and a narrowed aorta.  Four extremity blood pressures
were followed daily with no consistent differential between
upper  and
lower extremities.  Initial echo showed a moderate patent
ductus arteriosus but by [**9-21**], day of life two, this had
become much smaller and the aorta was thought to not be
narrowed.  She has persistent pallor since birth with variably
diminished BP, nl Hct, nl pH, with variably acceptable UOP,
and with impression of no coarctation.  only 1
plus brachial and femoral pulses.
urine output difficult to assess due to mixture with stool at
times. Nl BUN and , usually averaging 1 cc/kg per hour,
ttimes. Nl BUN and Cr. She is currently on Lasix 1 mg/kg
twice a day.  On the morning of transfer, in light of
increasing evidence of heart failure, she was begun on
Digoxin 5 mcg per kg per dose.

At the time of transfer, Baby Girl [**Known lastname 57586**] had an echo that
showed severe biventricular dysfunction, left worse than
right and again a concern for coarctation.  She was in a very
low output state and the decision was made to transfer her to
[**Hospital3 1810**] to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit for
further management.  She was begun on Dopamine 5 mcg/kg per
minute and also on Prostaglandin E1 0.05 mcg/kg per minute.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 57586**] was
initially begun on intravenous fluids at 80 cc per kg per day
on admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.  Feeds were
begun on day of life two.  Initially, all p.o. but as her
volume advanced, she was unable to take her full volume by
mouth; p.o./p.g. feeds were advanced to a total fluid of 150
cc per kg per day of breast milk or formula.  Then, calories
were advanced over the first week of life to a maximum of
Neosure 30 calories per ounce by day of life 10.  She was
assessed by swallow study for concern of her hoarse cough on
[**9-29**] and this revealed gross aspiration of both thin
and thick liquids.  She has been fed exclusively nasogastric
since that time.  On [**9-30**], she was noted to have
seizure activity in the evening and a serum calcium was 5.0.
She was bolused with intravenous calcium and started on
maintenance calcium gluconate in her feeds.  Her phosphorus
was also in the range of 12 at that time and she was switched
on formula over to Similac TM 60/40 at 20 calories per ounce.
She received multiple calcium boluses over the past three
days and, at the time of transfer, her most recent ionized
calcium was 0.8.  Her most recent magnesium on the morning of
transfer was 1.6 with a phosphorus of 7.7.  At the time of
transfer, she is halfway through receiving a bolus of Calcium
gluconate 200 mg/kg with a bolus of magnesium sulfate 50
mg/kg.

As noted previously, her urine output has been difficult to
measure and though to be low at times (1cc/kg/hr). Most
recently, it has been about 2 cc per kg per
hour.  She passes frequent heme negative stool.  Her most
recent electrolytes on the morning of transfer were 136;
potassium of 5.0; chloride 96; bicarbonate of 23; BUN 26;
creatinine 0.4; glucose of 98.  As part of her evaluation for
hypocalcemia, a parathyroid hormone was sent and is less than
6, with normal range being 15 to 65.  The endocrine team was
consulted and recommended Vitamin D therapy when she is able
to take feeds again.  Feeds were held on the afternoon of
transfer, secondary to worsening respiratory distress and
heart failure.  She has been started on intravenous fluids of
D-10-W with 20 meq per liter of sodium, mEq per liter of
potassium and 4 grams per liter of calcium gluconate.  Total
fluids are currently 120 cc per kg per day.

Hematology:  Initial hematocrit was 55.5 percent with
platelets of 116,000.  [**Doctor Last Name 2433**] has never required transfusion
with blood products. Her mo
