Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
I&D of abdominal wall abscess with placement of drainage ostomy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 56684**] is a 80 yo F NH resident with PMHx of DM2, HTN,
dementia, POD admitted for a lower abdominal abscess from
perforated diverticulosis. Patient was transferred from OSH for
abdominal pain/distention, found to have CT with a possible
bladder rupture which turned out to be an abscess. I&D was
performed on [**4-13**] with drain placed. Currently, the patient has
feculant material coming from the drain from a presumed fistula.
Per the surgical team, the patient is not an operative
candidate.

[**4-12**] EKG
Regular supraventricular rhythmn with baseline artifact
precluding definitive rhythm analysis, possibly sinus rhythm
with diminutive P waves. Low QRS voltage diffusely. Diffuse
non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**4-13**] EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Short P-R interval. Low voltage. Leftward

ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2153-4-12**]
probably
no significant change. Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**4-13**] CXR
.
SINGLE SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 12:00 A.M.: Lung volumes are
low,
resulting in vascular crowding. Opacity at the left lung base is
probably
atelectasis or a very small pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
The heart
size is normal. Accounting for patient rotation, there is no
hilar or
mediastinal enlargement. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. There
is no
increase in interstitial markings. There is extensive
subcutaneous air in the left abdominal wall, tracking along the
left chest wall.
.
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Left lung base opacity may indicate atelectasis or layering
pleural
effusion.
2. Extensive subcutaneous air overlying the left abdominal wall,
tracking to the left chest wall. OSH abdominopelvic CT (reviewed
on a separate
workstation and not available on [**Hospital1 18**] PACS) demonstrates this
to extend from a large abscess in the anterior pelvis.
.
[**4-15**] EKG
Probable atrial fibrillation but baseline artifact makes
assessment
difficult. Low precordial lead QRS voltage. Modest low amplitude
T wave
changes. Findings are non-specific. Since the previous tracing
of [**2153-4-13**] the rhythm now appears to be atrial fibrillation but
baseline artifact makes comparison difficult.
