severe dyspnea. He underwent stent trial after it was discovered

severe diffuse tracheobronchomalacia. This stent trial was
positive in the sense that he had marked improvement in his
overall symptoms. He had less dyspnea, less choking sensations
and less orthopnea as well. Prior to the airway
surgery, we did correct his reflux which was severe via
laparoscopic fundoplication. He now presents for correction of
his tracheobronchomalacia.

      MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2132-11-22**]):    No MRSA isolated.

CXR:
[**2132-11-23**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change. Unchanged clips in the right chest
wall. The lung volumes are slightly increased, the pleural
effusions have slightly decreased. No newly occurred focal
parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia. Unchanged size of
the cardiac silhouette.
[**2132-11-23**]: There are small bilateral effusions, left greater than
right. Skin staples are again seen on the right. There is no
pneumothorax.
[**2132-11-21**]: In comparison with the study of [**11-20**], the right chest
tube has
been removed. No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2132-11-19**]:  From the right, both pleural drain and the chest tube
are
inserted into the right hemithorax. There is moderate soft
tissue air
collection extending to the cervical soft tissues. The
evaluation of the lung itself is impaired by moderate motion
artifact. There is no visualization of pneumothorax. The left
costophrenic sinus is blunted by a small pleural effusion. No
effusion is seen on the right. Relatively low lung volumes with
moderate cardiomegaly, but without overt signs of overhydration.
Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 72853**] was admitted on [**2132-11-19**] for  Right thoracotomy and
thoracic tracheoplasty with mesh, left mainstem bronchoplasty
with mesh, right mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius
bronchoplasty with mesh, flexible bronchoscopy with aspiration.
He was extubated in the operating and transferred to the SICU
for further postoperative management.  The chest-tube was to
suction followed by serial chest films  a foley, and NGT. He had
an Epidural Bupivacaine 0.25% + Dilaudid 0.2mg managed by the
acute pain service.  On POD1 his pain was not well controlled
and the bupivacaine was increased to 1%.  He was seen by Speech
and Swallow but they deferred evaluation secondary to large
amount of secretions.  On POD2 he a Flexible bronchoscopy with
therapeutic aspiration. He was again seen by Speech and Swallow
and he had nos/SX of oropharyngeal dysphagia or aspiration.  He
was started on a clear liquid diet and advanced as tolerated.
The epidural was split with a Dilaudid PCA. The chest tube was
removed and follow-up chest film revealed no pneumothorax.  On
POD3 the epidural was removed. His PCA was converted to PO pain
medication with good results. He transferred to the floor. His
home medications were restarted.  On POD4-5 the foley was
removed.  He failed to void and the foley was re-inserted.  His
flomax was restarted. He required aggressive pulmonary toilet
and nebulizers. He was seen by physical therapy who recommended
rehab.  His lytes were repeated as needed. He was in sinus
rhythm throughout his hospital course.
