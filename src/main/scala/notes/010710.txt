HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
woman with a history type 2 diabetes and hypertension who was
admitted to the Coronary Care Unit on [**12-31**] as a
transfer from [**Hospital3 17310**] for bradycardia with
an idioventricular rhythm.  The patient gave a vague history
of one to two days of doing poorly at home with diminished
p.o. intake, increased dyspnea, and assessment mental status
changes.

On [**12-31**], Emergency Medical Service was called, and the
patient was found bradycardic at home with a heart rate in
the 20s with an idioventricular rhythm and associated
hypotension.  The patient received external pacing in the
field and was brought to [**Hospital3 17310**].

In the Emergency Department, her heart rate remained in
the 20s.  A chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart
failure.  Her potassium was 6.5, glucose was 350, creatinine
of 2.8.  There were no ketones in the urine.  AST and ALT
were elevated, consistent with shock liver.  At
[**Hospital3 17310**], the patient received calcium
gluconate 1 amp, and 10 units of insulin, and 1 unit of D-50,
1 amp bicarbonate, and 2 g of Kayexalate.  She was
subsequently wrapped in warm blankets for hypothermia and
intubated for comfort.

She was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**], and upon transfer the external pacer
temporarily failed.  Heart rate at that time was in the 20s
with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient
required temporary dopamine.  She was then found to revert
back to normal sinus rhythm in the 50s, and the dopamine drip
was discontinued.

On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 346**], electrocardiogram was consistent
with sinus bradycardia at 40 beats to 50 beats per minute
with a left bundle-branch block.  The patient was still
intubated on arrival.  Initial arterial blood gas was
7.36/28/590.  She was maintained on CPAP 10/5 with 50% FIO2.
ALT, AST, and lactate were elevated as noted above.  INR
was 1.4.  The patient received 10 mg of subcutaneous
vitamin K.  The patient was given aggressive intravenous
fluids for acute renal failure thought secondary to prerenal
azotemia.  A temporary pacing wire was placed on arrival
which was set at 40 beats per minute.  Given question of
sepsis and active sputum, the patient was started on Levaquin
for a question of pneumonia.  Blood cultures were sent.  The
heart rate was then stable in the 90s on [**2184-12-31**],
and the pacing wire was discontinued.  The following day,
with improvement in the patient's blood pressure, she was
restarted on her atenolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs at the
time of transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the
floor revealed temperature afebrile, blood pressure 166/80,
pulse 91, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 98% on 5
liters.  Appearance revealed the patient was awake, alert,
and following commands.  Did not speak English.  Head, ears,
nose, eyes and throat revealed dry oral mucosa.  Nasogastric
tube was in placed.  Neck revealed no jugular venous
distention, though difficult to assess.  Cardiovascular
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sound
and second heart sound.  No murmurs.  Lungs had crackles
halfway up bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, with active bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed
trace pedal edema.  Neurologic examination revealed the
patient followed commands, moved all four extremities, [**4-3**]
and equal bilaterally in her upper extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count was 17.8, hematocrit 25.5, platelets of 322.
Sodium of 131, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 20,
blood urea nitrogen 22, creatinine 1.2 (down from an
admission creatinine of 2.4), glucose of 184.  ALT was 870,
AST 701, LDH 691, alkaline phosphatase 78, total
bilirubin 0.6, amylase 170, lipase 588.  Calcium 8.3,
magnesium 1.4, phosphate 2.2.  INR was 1.3, albumin 3.5.
Sputum Gram stain showed greater than 25 polys, 4+
gram-positive cocci, 3+ gram-negative rods, 1+ gram-negative
rods.  Respiratory culture was pending.  Urine and blood
cultures were also pending.  Urinalysis was negative.
Creatine kinases were negative to date.  Troponin maximum
at 1.3.  Iron was 18.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on the day of transfer
revealed congestive heart failure with underlying chronic
interstitial disease with evidence of increased cephalization
compared to the prior study with the question of a left lower
lobe process.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient presented with bradycardia
thought secondary to prerenal state, perhaps brought about by
hyperglycemia and/or infection.  Prerenal state may have
resulted in acidosis hyperkalemia with possible poor
clearance of her atrioventricular nodal blockers which
included verapamil and atenolol at the time of presentation.
The patient had no known cardiac history; although, her son
later admitted that she had a heart attack years earlier.
She was noted to have  a troponin leak in the setting of
congestive heart failure and poor perfusion.  Otherwise, she
ruled out for a myocardial infarction.

The patient was placed on telemetry with no acute
arrhythmias; however, she was noted to be in sinus
tachycardia consistently status post transfer from the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was put back on her
atenolol and verapamil; although, verapamil was ultimately
discontinued and beta blocker was titrate upward.

The patient underwent an echocardiogram which revealed
evidence of global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of
approximately 35% and a partially reversible inferolateral
defect.  The Cardiology Service was consulted to evaluate
regarding the echocardiogram and the patient's persistent
tachycardia.  The Cardiology Service felt that because it was
only a partially reversible defect, given the patient's other
complicating medical issues, a cardiac catheterization was
not indicated at this time.  Instead, the patient's cardiac
regimen was aggressively titrated up until the time of
discharge.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was maintained on Levaquin for
presumed pneumonia and completed a 10-day course with a
normalization of her white blood cell count and no fevers.
She initially underwent some gentle diuresis for congestive
heart failure but did not require further diuresis for the
duration of her hospital stay.  However, she was maintained
on aggressive ACE inhibitor for afterload and preload
reduction.

3.  RENAL:  The patient with a history of acute renal failure
on presentation, consistent with generalized hypoperfusion in
the setting of her bradycardia.  Her creatinine gradually
normalized.  She experienced no recurrent hyperkalemia.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient's hematocrit was noted to
trend down; although, she was guaiac-negative.  She should
likely be evaluated for an outpatient colonoscopy given her
iron deficiency anemia.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit was noted to hover
at 25 to 27; which appeared to be her baseline.  As noted,
she was guaiac-negative.  She was found to be iron deficient
and was repleted during this hospitalization.  Her INR was
elevated on admission, and this improved with vitamin K times
one.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient with a history of type 2
diabetes.  She was put back on her Glucophage and glipizide
with the addition of an insulin sliding-scale for better
glycemic control.

7.  PHYSICAL THERAPY:  The patient was aggressively managed
by the Physical Therapy team given the fact that she had no
insurance and could not participate in acute rehabilitation.
She was ultimately cleared by Physical Therapy who will also
be making several home safety visits via the Free Care
Program.
