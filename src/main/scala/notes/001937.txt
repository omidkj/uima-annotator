ADDENDUM:  This dictation will cover the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course from [**2178-8-13**] through [**2178-8-21**].  The
early part of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was dictated by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM
(CONTINUED):  The patient was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit on [**2178-8-13**].

1.  RENAL ISSUES:  While on the Medicine floor, the patient
underwent further diuresis with Lasix and metolazone.  The
patient was continued on hemodialysis.

The patient was followed closely by the Renal Service.
Gradually, her renal function and acidosis improved.
Therefore, hemodialysis was discontinued.

2.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient underwent a magnetic
resonance imaging of her brain on [**2178-8-13**].  This
magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated areas of signal
abnormalities that probably represented subacute infarction.

A magnetic resonance angiography of the cervical vasculature
revealed no hemodynamically significant stenoses.

The patient was followed closely by the Neurology Service.
It was recommended that she be started on Dilantin for
seizure prophylaxis.  Due to difficulties achieving
therapeutic Dilantin levels, the patient was changed to
Keppra.

Her neurological functional status improved over the
remainder of her hospitalization, and the patient had
improved movement of her left side.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
Isordil, hydralazine, beta blocker, and Lasix.

The Cardiology Service was consulted for further workup of
her cardiomyopathy.  Cardiac catheterization was pursued, yet
this procedure was put on hold given since the patient had
undergone a cardiac catheterization on a previous admission.
The results of that cardiac catheterization were consistent
with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient worked with Physical
Therapy and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Simvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Hydralazine 20 mg by mouth four times per day.
5.  Synthroid 0.088 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Lasix 60 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Keppra 250 mg by mouth twice per day.
8.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Renal tubular acidosis (type 1).
2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Acute renal failure.
5.  Seizures.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
7.  Anxiety.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's discharge status was to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to follow up with her primary care physician.
