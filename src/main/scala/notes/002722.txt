Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Nitroglycerin / Naprosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness and abdominal fullness on initial presentation then
transferred with hypotension, tachycardia, intubated.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F s/p AAA repair, patient brought to [**Hospital3 **]
following episode of weakness, and vomitted, followed by patient
"slumping over" and becoming unresponsive.  She was intubated
and
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tachycardia and hypotension to 70s
sBP.  She was, by report, pale, cool and diaphoretic).  At
[**Location (un) 620**] the patient's blood pressure reportedly responded to
fluids and pressors.  It is uncertain whether she experienced
abdominal pain previously but on presentation to this hospital
she was noted to have a positive FAST scan for fluid in
[**Location (un) 6813**] pouch.  Given her history of AAA repair, patient was
assessed by vascular surgery.  Patient was incontinent of large
amounts of liquid stool which was guaiac negative.  She was
reportedly afebrile throughout.

Patient's family reports that she had a ?septic joint for the
past 10 days. Per report review of systems was otherwise
negative.

[**2112-11-29**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Interval development of a small amount of intra-abdominal
ascites in a
perisplenic and perihepatic location with also ascites tracking
down the
paracolic gutters.
2. Segment of bowel wall thickening and associated colonic
stranding and
fluid, most indicative of a colitis involving the descending
colon. The
SMA/[**Female First Name (un) 899**] origins are heavily calcified.
3. Extensive atherosclerotic disease as detailed above with no
evidence of
acute rupture. Focal areas of outpouching do not demonstrate
contrast within them and are likely related to prior
post-surgical change/hematoma.

[**2112-11-29**] Head CT : 1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left masticator space of
uncertain etiology, the majority immediately medial to the left
temporal-mandibular joint. Clinical correlation with the
findings in this region is advised.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The abundant fluid and
aerosolized secretions occupying the nasopharynx, nasal choanae
and dorsal aspect of the nasal cavity likely relates to
intubation and supine positioning. The pockets of subcutaneous
emphysema, largely in the left masticator space, may reside in
the pterygoid venous plexus and its tributaries, but should be
correlated with history of recent placement of intravenous
access, possibly of relatively large-bore.

[**2112-12-3**] Right arm duplex scan : 1. No right upper extremity
DVT.
2. Mild subcutaneous edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 50064**] was evaluated by the Acute care Service in the
Emergency Room and her scans were reviewed.  Based on her
presenting symptoms to [**Location (un) 620**] and he CT scan she was admitted
to the ICU for ischemic colitis, placed on broad spectrum
antibiotics, hydrated and her blood pressure was supported with
pressors initially.  She was also evaluated by the Vascular
Surgery service as there was some question of a possible
pseudoaneurysm from her AAA repair in [**2102**].  The repair was
intact, all arteries were patent and there was no evidence of
any vascular events to explain her possible low flow state.

Prior to admission her family remembered that she complained of
large amounts of liquid stool.  Her rectal exam was normal and
her stool was guiac negative.  A stool for C difficile was also
negative. Her elevated WBC was gradually trending down and her
abdominal exam improved daily.

Her INR at [**Location (un) 620**] was 5.7 and she received 2 units of FFP to
try to normalize it. Her hematocrit on admission was 29 and
gradually decreased to 21 but she was asymptomatic and therefore
not transfused.  Prior to discharge her hematocrit was 23.8.

She was easily extubated from the respirator on [**2112-12-1**] and
remained free of any pulmonary complications during her stay.
from a cardiovascular standpoint she was easily weaned off her
pressors after she was fully fluid resuscitated.  Her pre
admission medications were resumed and her blood pressure was
140/80-90 without any hypotension. She was on an ACE inhibitor,
beta blocker as well as Lasix for her chronic diastolic heart
failure and she tolerated these medications well.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to make
good progress.  Her abdominal pain resolved and she was working
with the Physical Therapist daily to improve her endurance.  Her
appetite was only fair but she would gladly take protein shakes
for supplementation.  She had some right shoulder pain weeks
prior to admission although no injury was noted on scans.  The
Physical Therapy service gave her some exercises to do to
improve her ROM which she will continue with.

On [**2112-12-3**] she had a duplex scan done of the right upper
extremity to rule out DVT as she had noticible swelling in the
lower arm and hand.  She did have a right subclavian line in
place in the ICU.  The scan was negative and elevation helped a
bit but she will need to continue that as well as staying off
her right side.

She will complete a 7 day course of Flagyl and Cipro on [**2112-12-7**]
which she has done well with.  Her Coumadin has been on hold
since admission but there is no reason to withhold it any
longer.  Her home dose was 3 mg daily and can begin tonight.

She was discharged to rehab on [**2112-12-5**] and will follow up in
the Acute Care Clinic in [**2-24**] weeks.
