[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman with hx C.diff, pancreatitis, here with abd
pain, fever, [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **], lipase, CT without pancreatitis or stone.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for signs of choledocholithiasis, pancreatitis.
LIMITED EVALUATION OF THE ABDOMEN.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Pancreatitis, abdominal pain, evaluate for
choledocholithiasis.

FINDINGS: Limited evaluation of the right upper quadrant and
common bile duct was performed. Shadowing stones are present in
the gallbladder. There is layering sludge and [**Doctor Last Name 5691**] as well
within the gallbladder. There is no significant gallbladder wall
thickening. There is no pericholecystic fluid. The left and
right hepatic ducts are dilated and the common bile duct is
dilated as well to the level of the pancreatic head. The CBD
measures 16 mm in diameter. An ERCP from [**2193**] also demonstrates
significant dilatation of the common bile duct. No shadowing
stones are seen within the common bile duct. No echogenic debris
is present within the common bile duct. No mass is seen within
the pancreatic head. There is no peripancreatic fluid
collection.

There is no pancreatic duct dilatation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
2. No choledocholithiasis as clinically questioned.
3. Dilatation of the left and right hepatic ducts as well as the
common bile duct. These findings were seen on the recent CT and
common bile duct dilatation was noted on an ERCP from [**2193**].

GB DRAINAGE,INTRO PERC TRANHEP BIL US  [**2195-10-22**] 1:34 PM

GB DRAINAGE,INTRO PERC TRANHEP; GUIDANCE PERC TRANS BIL DRAINA

Reason: for drainage

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman with acute cholecystitis, poor operative
candidate
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
for drainage
ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PERCUTANEOUS CHOLECYSTOSTOMY

CLINICAL HISTORY: Cholecystitis, poor surgical candidate.
Limited images of the gallbladder demonstrate a large amount of
sludge and shadowing stones in a distended gallbladder. The
extrahepatic common duct is enlarged measuring 1.5 cm in
diameter.

The advantages and complications of the procedure were explained
to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained. A
preprocedure timeout was called to confirm the patient's
identity and type of procedure to be performed. The patient was
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1%
was used as a topical anesthetic and a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 11025**] [**Last Name (Titles) 45890**]l and Versed intravenously. Under ultrasound guidance, an
8 French catheter was inserted into the gallbladder.
Approximately 100 cc of purulent fluid were removed. The
catheter was coiled and ultrasound demonstrated proper placement
of the catheter. The patient tolerated the procedure
satisfactorily. There were no complications. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was
present for all significant portions of the procedure.

IMPRESSION: Status post ultrasound-guided percutaneous
cholecystostomy with placement of an 8 French drainage catheter.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2195-10-21**] 9:24 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST

Reason: R/O ANY free air, no PO or IV contrast please
Field of view: 40

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman with acute cholecystitis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
R/O ANY free air, no PO or IV contrast please
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: CRI

TECHNIQUE: 64-MDCT axial images of the abdomen were obtained
without oral or IV contrast.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL OR IV CONTRAST: There are
bilateral moderate- sized pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis. There is no pericardial effusion.

The patient is status post G-tube placement which appears to be
in good position.

There are multiple gallstones within gallbladder and thickening
of the wall and inflammatory changes around the gallbladder
consistent with the known diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The
common bile duct is prominent measuring approximately 15 mm but
is not particularly changed when compared to [**2195-10-13**].
There is no evidence of free air in the abdomen. The appearance
of the kidneys are unchanged when compared to the prior study.
There is again noted a cyst in upper pole of the left kidney.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. There are multiple small
retroperitoneal mesenteric lymph nodes, which are stable when
compared to the prior study. These do not meet CT criteria for
pathology.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL OR IV CONTRAST: There is no free
fluid or free air in the pelvis. There is a Foley catheter
within the urinary bladder. The sigmoid, rectum, and adnexa are
stable when compared to the prior study.

BONE WINDOWS: The patient is status post posterior spinal fusion
of L3/L4/L5/S1. There are severe degenerative changes of the
lumbar spine. There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Imaging of the bone is limited due to artifact c
