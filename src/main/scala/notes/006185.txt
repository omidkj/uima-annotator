Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
R foot gangrene

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lower Extremity Angiography

Redo femoral endarterectomy and patch angioplasty of the right
femoral artery and a transmetatarsal amputation of the right
foot


History of Present Illness:
60F with IDDM, CAD and PVD s/p right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass x2 at [**Hospital1 10551**] and L SFA stent and angioplasties for in-stent stenosis
here by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **]
with worsening right foot ulcer, concerning for infection and
possible acute ischemia. According to the patient, she has had
gradual worsening - over a period of 2 weeks - of right foot
redness, increased purulence, and pain. Patient has VNA, who
performs dressing changes, but they were concerned about
persistent gangrene of great toe ulcer and new drainage from
inbetween first and second toe and low grade fevers to 100. She
has not been able to walk at home for the past 3 weeks and
having rest pain in both R>L foot. She developed a small ulcer 2
weeks ago on the medial aspect of the right foot and has been
getting progressively worse. Went to OSH yesterday, was started
on vanco/cipro/flagyl and heparin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further care.

On the floor, the patient continues to complain of rest pain of
her right foot, as well as shooting pain down her leg and bad
neuropathy. The patient says that this is a chronic issue, but
more acutely she has had more redness and drainage from the foot
ulcer.

Foot Xray: Subcutaneous emphysema and soft tissue swelling,
consistent with soft tissue infection. Patchy osteopenia and
cystic changes about the 1st MTP and 1st toe phalanges. The ddx
includes reactive changes and changes related to chronic djd. No
definite acute bone destruction to confirm the the presence of
osteomyelitis, but the possibility of early osteomyelitis
remains a consideration.

Catheterization: COMMENTS: 1. Right lower extremity angiography
with distal run-off to foot, and abdominal aortography was
obtained via retrograde access through the left common femoral
artery with placement of a 5 Fr sheath, using digital
subtraction and a power injector. Abdominal aortography was
performed using an Omni-Flush catheter(4 Fr) placed at the level
of the L1-L2. Selective right lower extremity angiography was
obtained by crossing over the aortic bifurcation using a 4 Fr
straight glidecath placed at the level of the distal external
iliac artery. A peak-to-peak gradient of 40 mm Hg was documented
between the central aortic pressure and pressure in the right
external iliac artery.
2. Abdominal aorta had minimal plaques with no significant
stenosis or
aneurysm. The renal arteries were not imaged. 3. Right lower
extremity: The aortic bifurcation was widely patent. The
external iliac artery just distal to the origin of the right
internal iliac artery had a 70% stenosis. RIIA was widely
patent. The right common femoral [**Last Name (un) **] was diffusely diseased
with a 90% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft. The
graft itself had a 99% lesion at its
proxim

CXR: IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. No evidence
of focal infectious process.

Cath [**2147-4-2**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe stenosis of the right common femoral artery proximal
to the
ostium of the femoro-popliteal saphenous vein bypass graft
(90%).
2. Severe ostial stenosis of the femoro-popliteal vein graft
(99%).
3. Successful stenting of a 70% stenosis of the right external
iliac
artery (with a gradient of 40 mm Hg across) with a Genesis
balloon-expandable stent.
4. Successful closure of the left common femoral arteriotomy
with an
Exoseal closure device.
5. Vascular surgery consult.

MRI [**2147-4-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarcts, mass effect, hydrocephalus or
enhancing
brain lesion seen.
2. No evidence of focal cortical abnormalities identified or
evidence of
abnormal signals or asymmetry seen within the hippocampal
regions. The
hippocampal architecture is maintained.
3. Subtle hyperintensities smaller than 3 mm at the convexity in
the frontal
lobe appear to be due to slightly prominent perivascular spaces.

4. Incidental lipoma at the superior aspect of the right
cerebellar
hemisphere extending to the quadrigeminal region.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year-old female with PAD, CAD, DM (last A1c
9.9%), tobacco abuse s/p R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] x2 in the past who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with large non-healing ulcer of the medial
aspect of the R 1st MTT and infected ulcer between the 1st and
2nd right toe probing down to bone. Found to have osteomyelitis
and is now s/p R TMA.

# Right Foot osteomyelitis: The patient had increased drainage
from the interdigital space of toe [**12-12**]. Presented initially to
[**Hospital3 **] and was started on vanco/cipro/flagyl and
heparin. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managmenet. At [**Hospital1 18**],
foot films revealed lucencies concerning for osteomyelitis. The
patient had a low grade fever and leukocytosis. Blood and wound
cultures were taken but remained (-). Continued on
vanc/cipro/flagyl. Taken by vascular surgery for TMA and R
femoral endarterectomy on [**2147-4-4**].

# PAD: The patient is s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass of R leg and SFA
stenting of the left with cath in the past for in-stent
restenosis. The patient contin
