History of Present Illness:
67 y/o M h/o DM, CRI, PVD S/P bilat BKA, CAD S/P 4v CABG in 94,
S/P mult PTCAs (most recent in [**11-1**]). Presents with acute onset

Imaging:
CHEST - PORTABLE AP ([**2184-12-29**]): Heart size is within normal
limits. Multiple surgical clips are again demonstrated. The
lungs are clear. No pleural effusion. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature does not appear engorged.
.
TTE ([**2184-12-30**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction
30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the entire
interventricular septum and inferior free wall; the posterior
wall is also somewhat hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
LEFT KNEE ([**2184-12-30**]): Left knee, AP and lateral views show
below-the-knee amputation. The stump margin at the tibia is well
corticated except medially there is some indistinctness which
may indicate early infection, however, there is no evidence of
bone destruction to suggest frank osteomyelitis. The stump
margin of the fibula is irregular with a small amount of
heterotopic bone formation. Note is made of chondrocalcinosis in
the knee. There is a small knee effusion. Small retropatellar
osteophytes are present. There is soft tissue swelling at the
margin.
.
EXTREMITY US ([**2184-12-30**]): Grayscale images of the left stump
demonstrate an extensive fluid collection surrounding the stump
with some internal echoes within it. Soft tissue edema is also
seen. No color flow is seen in this area.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Ischemia - Patient presented with chest pain and changes on
ECG concerning for ongoing ischemia, particularly ST elevation
of V1-V3 as well as aVR with reciprocal depressions in I,II, aVL
and V4-V6. Given his known severe CAD and lack of intervenable
targets, the patient elected for medical therapy. Treatment was
initiated with BB, statin, Heparin gtt, Plavix, ACE. The
patient's cardiac markers were trended through his hospital
course with peak CK 290 on [**2184-12-31**]. For the first few days of
his stay, the patient had ongoing chest pain that was managed
with morphine sulfate as well as SL Nitro that was eventually
transitioned back to patient's home regimen of Imdur 90mg po
bid.
.
2) Pump - Patient's previously documented EF was 35-40% in
[**11-1**]. A repeat echocardiogram performed during hospitalization
showed an EF of 30%, likely secondary to progression of his
ischemic cardiomyopathy. His I/Os and weights were monitored QD,
and he remained euvolemic by exam. He was continued on an ECE-I
for  depressed EF. The patient would likely meet criteria for an
ICD given his depressed EF and runs of NSVT. However, this was
deferred given his code status.
.
3) Rhythm - Patient was noted to have ventricular bigeminy by
EMS en route to [**Hospital1 18**], which was successfully treated with a
one-time administration of lidocaine. He was monitored on
telemetry during hospitalization, which showed NSR, but with
occasional PVCs and frequent atrial ectopy. He was also noted to
have a few runs of NSVT (< 10 beats) on telemetry, which were
asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
.
4) Left BKA stump cellulitis - On admission the patient reported
a history of rigors, chills, and a fever to 103 prior to
hospitalization. He was noted to have a small ulcer on his left
BKA stump that was draining purulent material and with a
surrounding cellulitis. He was emperically started on Unasyn and
evaluated by the vascular surgery service who recommended an
ultrasound of the extremity. The U/S suggested the presence of a
fluid collection. However, vascular service reviewed the images
and did not feel there was a discrete pocket of fluid ammenable
to drainage. The patient continued IV antibiotics with Unasyn
while in house for an emperic 10 day course (ending on [**2185-1-8**]) which will be completed at the extended care facility.
With treatment, the patient was noted to have a normalizing
fever curve, resolving leukocytosis, and decreased erythema of
the left stump. All blood cultures drawn throughout
hospitalization were negative at the time of discharge. A
lactate on the day of admission was 1.2.
.
5) Chronic Renal Insufficiency - Patient has known CRI with a
baseline creatinine
