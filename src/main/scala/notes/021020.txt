In the ED, he was afebrile and normotensive, RR 20s, initially
98s on NRB which was started by EMS. He was placed on 40% FM,
satting low 90s. Initially very wheezy, thought COPD
exacerbation, and was given continuous nebs and prednisone 60mg
PO x 1. CXR revealed b/l infiltrates consistent with either pulm
edema vs multifocal pneumonia. He was given CTX/Azithro for CAP
followed by Levofloxacin for double coverage by protocol. He got
up to go to the bathroom and desatted to the 70s, so was placed
on a Bipap. His BP remained 120-170 systolic, so was given lasix

CXR pa/l [**2136-2-17**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Increased interstitial markings and more focal pulmonary
opacities at both lung bases possibly representing intersitial
with areas of alveolar pulmonary edema. However, multifocal
pneumonia with interstital edema should also be considered.
Follow-up radiographs after diuresis may be of benefit to
evaluate between the two.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right
.
ECG (no old to compare): RBBB, S1,T3


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 83 y.o. man presents with COPD, tobacco use history, HTN,
who presented with SOB and was admited for hypoxic resp distress
with 24 hours in the ICU.
.
# Resp distress: Thought to be multifactorial. CXR with b/l
infiltrates and the initial differential dx included multifocal
pna, Influenza, CHF, +/- superimposed COPD exacerbation.
Malignancy or interstitial lung dz were also considered as was
PE considered but this was considered less likely given lack of
recent risk factors. WBC normal with normal diff, elev BNP, pt
afebrile, making CHF more likely than pneumonia. No wheezes on
exam to suggest COPD. It appears patient very immobile at home,
with DOE after walking a flight of stairs for last several
months.  He doesn't endorse any LE edema however.  Patient was
diuresed with IV lasix with good response.  He completed a
course of CTX/azithromycin while here.  His DFA for influeza was
negative.  Patient also underwent an echocardiogram which showed
nl EF with mild diastolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary HTN.
Patient also underwent chest CT which confirmed underlying
emphysema along with asbestosis.  Patient confirmed exposure to
asbestos while working as a tiler and an electric welder.
Patient was started on inhaled steroids and continued nebs for
ongoing wheezing and will need to finish an oral steroid taper
at rehab.  Patient was oxygenating 88-92% on 6L and was
transfered out to regular to regular medicine floor.  He is
likely to require home oxygen and pulmonary follow up for
asbestosis including chest CT/PET scan for further asbestosis
workup and lung nodule evalution. He is scheduled for pulm
follow up. He can also have an echo with a bubble study as an
outpatient to eval for shunting although this was felt to be
less likely.
.
# Renal failure: Baseline unknown, pt does not report CKD. Could
be poor forward flow [**3-10**] CHF. His lisinopril was held.  His Cr
improved with gentle diuresis making CHF more likely.  His FeBUN
was 46% and FeNa was 1% making a prerenal pictures less likely.
Patient's lisinopril was held while in house.  He was continued
on Lasix 40mg po Qday.  He should have his labs checked as
instructed. His lisinorpil can be started by his outpatient
doctors if his [**Name5 (PTitle) **] remains stable.
