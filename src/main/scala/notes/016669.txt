ECG Study Date of [**2143-2-19**]  10:43:38 PM
Technically difficult study
Sinus rhythm
Early R wave progression
Anterolateral T wave changes
Low limb lead voltage
No previous tracing available for comparison

CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W/W&WO C AND RECONS Study Date of
[**2143-2-19**] 5:58 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Very large fusiform infrarenal aortic aneurysm with irregular
plaque,
thrombus and heterogeneous filling. For further details, see
description
above and refer to the AAA reporting tool.
2. Focal areas of suprarenal aorta dissections or ulcerative
plaques.
3. Severe atherosclerotic disease of bilateral lower extremity
vessels as
described above. 50% stenosis of the right proximal SFA.
4. Occlusion of the right common iliac artery with distal
reconstitution via the internal iliac artery.
5. Wedge compression fracture of L2 and severe degenerative
changes.
6. Scarring in both kidneys and left kidney hypodensity, too
small to
characterize, likely a cyst.
7. Gallstones.
8. Splenic calcifications, likely old hematoma, old infarct,
prior infection or prior granulomatous exposure.
9. Bibasilar interstitial thickening and ground-glass opacity
could be due to volume overload or interstitial lung disease.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2143-2-20**] at 1:50:59 PM      FINAL
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
infero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


ECG Study Date of [**2143-2-20**]  10:52:04 AM
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left anterior fascicular
block. Diffuse
non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2143-2-19**] multiple abnormalities as previously
noted persist without major change.

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2143-2-22**] 12:09 PM
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: The heart size is moderately enlarged. The
patient is
status post sternotomy and CABG. There are relatively low
inspiratory lung
volumes with mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm causing
some vascular crowding. There is no overt congestive failure and
no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. Calcified abdominal
aortic aneurysm is noted. The study and the report were reviewed
by the staff radiologist.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2143-2-25**] 9:14 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Development of large intramuscular hematoma within the right
iliopsoas
muscle status post infrarenal aortic aneurysm graft repair.
Evaluation of the graft itself, as well as the fem-fem bypass
graft, is limited without
contrast.
2. Cholelithiasis. Interval development of gallbladder
distention likely
reflects limited p.o. intake.
3. Anasarca and small right pleural effusion.







Brief Hospital Course:
[**2143-2-19**] Transferred from OSH with ischemic/cold right lower
extremity. CTA was done that showed- very large fusiform
infrarenal aortic aneurysm with irregular plaque,
thrombus and heterogeneous filling. Suprarenal aorta dissections
or ulcerative plaques.Severe atherosclerotic disease of
bilateral lower extremity vessels. Occlusion of the R CIA.
Routine nursing care, pre-op for angiogram/EVAR.

[**2143-2-20**] Cardiac clearance, ECG, ECHO was done- [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**]
dilated.  Normal LV w/ left systolic dysfunction, basal to mid
infero-lateral hypokinesis. RV normal.(1+) AR. (1+) MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 81002**]s.

[**2143-2-22**] Taken to OR and underwent Aorto uni-iliac stent graft
repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Left-to-right
femoral-femoral bypass grafting. Routine invasive monitoring
lines were placed. Recovered in the PACU, then transferred to
[**Wardname 10876**] VICU/telemetry.

[**2143-2-23**] POD1 Overnight patient was confused-restrained. Hct down
24.2 Transfused w/ 2 units PRBC. Low urine output- recieved
multiple fluid boluses. Tachycardic started Metoprolol IV prn to
keep HR <100. Hydromorphone IV for pain control. Electrolytes
repleted.

[**2143-2-24**] POD2 Remains confused and mechanically restrained, also
strted on Lorazepam for agitation. Remained in the VICU. On
lower extremity bypass pathway. Bedrest. Continued to drop Hct.
Transfused w/ 2 uints PRBC given Lasix post transfusion.

[**2143-2-25**] POD3 Continues to drop Hct and require blood
transfusions. CT pelvis was done showed- right iliopsoas muscle
with a large hematoma. Remains confused w/ periods of agitation
w/ wrist restraints and Lorazepam prn agitation. Became
tachycardic 150's A-flutter- Bolused w/ Diltiazem and placed on
a drip
