Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Plavix / Shellfish

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective admit for R carotid stent

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R ICA stent

History of Present Illness:
80 yo F w/ hx of PVD, bilateral carotid dz, left CEA x3 ('[**12**] x
2, '[**27**] p/w L side TIA), right CEA x1 ('[**27**]), HTN, hyperlipidemia,
suspected subclavian steal, and multiple TIAs who is admitted
for elective R carotid stent.  In [**October 2137**], she had a TIA with sx
of left hand/arm weakness.  No diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia,
aphasia, gait instability, or other focal deficits.  She was
worked up at an OSH with MRI/MRA showing significant R carotid
lesion. Duplex ultrasaound showed right carotid restenosis >90%.
 She was started on Plavix for stroke prevention and was
discharged with planned elective right CEA.  She went to
[**Location (un) 1110**]/[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] Hospital for attempted right CEA but with
significant complications from anestheia.  She was given the
option of re-CEA or carotid angioplasty/stent and decided to go
for carotid stent.  She had a second TIA involving right
amaurosis fugax like "black curtain over the eye" lasting 5 min.
 This occurred after she stopped taking Plavix secondary to
itching.  Angiography revealed diffuse abdominal aortic disease
with 70% tubular lesion at the level of the renal arteries,
bilateral iliac disease with 80% ostial right and modest ostial
left, 70% tubular left subclavian lesions before vertebrals and
>90% right carotid disease at origin.  Also with 70% right
vertebral, 99% focal left vertebrals in CEA segment.  Pt
underwent PCA/stenting R carotid w/ 0% residual.  Of note,
central aortic SBP range 30-40 mg Hg above R arm cuff pressure.
Pt denies CP, SOB, dysarthria, weakness, parasthetic, headache,
visual changes.

Neurological Hx: She has asymmetric BP in UE.  She gets dizzy
when she reaches up, suspicious for sublcavian steal.
Brain/Neck MRA showed 80-80% stenosis of R ICA; 40 % stenosis of
L ICA.  Hypoplastic right A1 segment.  Carotid duplex in [**September 2137**] showing 40-60% R ICA stenosis

CATH:
.  Access was retrograde via the right CFA to the selective
carotid and
vertebral arteries.
2.  Abdominal aorta:  Severe diffuse disease at the level of the
renals
with a tubular 70% lesion.  The thoracic aorta was a bovine Type
I.
3.  Renal arteries:  Bilaterally single without evidence of
ostial
disease.
4.  RLE:  There was an ostial 80% CIA lesion.
5.  LLE:  The CIA had modest ostial disease.
6.  Subclavians:  The LSCA had a tubular 70% lesion before the
vertebral
and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] take-offs with a mean 10 mmHg gradient across the
lesion.
7.  Carotid/vertebral arteries:  The right vertebral had a 70%
origin
lesion.  The vertebral filled the cerebellar and PCA vessels
without
lesions.  The left vertebral had a moderate origin lesion with
competitive flow at the basilar from the contralateral artery.
The LCCA
was normal.  The [**Doctor First Name 3098**] was widely patent and filled the
ipsilateral ACA,
MCA and the contralateral ACA.  The [**Country **] had a 99% lesion in the
CEA
segment with ipsilateral filling of the MCA only.
8.  Stenting of the [**Country **] was performed with a tapered [**8-30**] x 30
mm
Acculink stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Carotid disease: [**Doctor First Name 3098**] was widely patent and filled the
ipsilateral ACA,
MCA and the contralateral ACA.  The [**Country **] had a 99% lesion in the
CEA
segment with ipsilateral filling of the MCA only which was
stented with
a tapered [**8-30**] x 30 mm Acculink stent.  Pt has allergy to
shellfish so she was premedicated with benadryl, H2-blocker, and
steroid prior to cath.  Pt's BP was controlled with IV
nitroprusside post-cath, and was weaned as BP was controlled
with oral agents: metoprolol 50 mg po bid, Norvasc 10 mg po qd,
Accupril 10 mg po qd.  Pt was started on ticlodipine 250 mg po
bid as she can not tolerate Plavix.

2. HTN: Pt's R cuff pressure is ~30 mmHg < then the central
pressure.  Since pt has undergone multiple CEA's she was not
prone to carotid sensitivity from stent placement.  As above, BP
initially controlled with nitroprusside to keep arm SBP 80-100.
She was started on metoprolol 50 mg po bid and Norvasc 10 mg po
qd.  She continued her Accupril 10 mg po qd.

3. PVD: Cath showed L subclavian artery had a tubular 70% lesion
before the vertebral and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] take-offs with a mean 10 mmHg
gradient across the lesion. Pt will be scheduled for left
subclavian stent in the future.  She was continued on ASA and
Lipitor.

4. CHF: Hx of diastolic dysfunction.  Pt gets lasix prn at home.
 Lasix was held initially.  But after post-cath hydration, pt
found to have small crackles on exam, so IV lasix 20 mg was
given once prior to discharge.

Medications on Admission:
ASA 81 mg po qd, Ativan 0.5 mg tid prn, nadolol 20 mg po qd,
Accupril 10 mg po qd, Lipitor 20 mg po qpm, ranitidine 300 mg
qpm, Combivent inh qid: prn, Lasix 30 mg po prn.
