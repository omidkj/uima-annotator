Phenytoin / Nsaids

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, Shortness of Breath, Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
Removal of Pleurex Catheter from left chest


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69F wtih a history of cerebral palsy,
developmental delay with cognitive impairment, and recurrent
left pleural effusion s/p placement of pleurx catheter ([**3-/2191**])
who presents with cough, shortness of breath and fever. Patient
with recurrent left sided pleural effusion dating back to late
[**2190**] of unclear etiology, symptomatic secondary to trapped lung.
She underwent a pleur-x catheter placement for this in [**Month (only) **]
of this year. At that time biopsy and pleural fluid sampling
demonstrated exudative lymphocytic pleural fluid of unclear
etiology as pathology only with reactive mesotheialial cells c/w
chronic inflammation (pleuritis). She was recently seen in [**Hospital **]
clinic on [**2191-8-16**] for catheter drainage x2 weeks. Could not
flush/drain catheter in clinic so instilled tPA and then able to
drain 50cc fluid. She returned to nursing home but today noted
to have progressively worsening non-productive cough and febrile
to 100.9. Went to [**Hospital3 **], noted to be 88%RA, CXR
with worsening pleural effusion on left. 225cc fluid drained
there. She was then transferred by ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED initial vitals were: 99.9 94 100/39 18 98 3L NC. IP
saw here noted to be sicker looking and coughing but without any
complaints. Labs unremarkable (WBC of 9, lactate of 1.4). CT
scan was performed. IP saw and drained 550cc of serosanguinous
fluid, studies sent. She was given vanc 1mg IV and zosyn 4.5mg
IV.

Social History:
[obtained per H and P from [**Hospital3 **]] Pt without hx of
substance abuse. Denies physical abuse. She resided in a nursing
care facility for 8 years. Community placement was attempted in
late [**2190**], but patient developed failure to thrive and admitted
to acute care almost immediately.

Pertinent Imaging:
[**2191-8-18**]: CXR
New large left pleural effusion and left basilar consolidation,
possibly representing atelectasis, but infection cannot be
excluded. Tiny locules of gas projecting over the left lung base
are likely within the pleural space. Left Pleurx catheter in
unchanged position.
.
[**2191-8-18**]: CT CHEST
1. Marked enlargement of probably loculated left pleural
effusion with features suggestive of superimposed infection,
possibly empyema. Rounded foci of air within the collapsed basal
left lower lobe may communicate with similar foci in the complex
subpulmonic fluid collection raising concern for bronchopleural
fistula. Left transthoracic drainage catheter as above.
2. New small right pleural effusion.

CXR:
[**2191-8-31**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
minimal increase in extent of the right-sided pleural effusion,
leading to a blunting of the right medial cardiophrenic space
and increased right basilar atelectasis.
On the left, there is a small increase in pleural effusion, one
of the three left-sided chest tubes has been removed in the
interval.
No other changes, notably no evidence of newly appeared focal
parenchymal
opacities indicative of pneumonia.
[**2191-8-23**]: CXR
Two loculations within moderate left pleural effusion, which in
the right clinical setting would raise concern for empyema.
[**2191-8-21**]: The left pleural effusion is currently loculated.
There is no change since [**8-18**], but there is significant
decrease since [**8-18**] and 9. There is loculated air within the
right upper pleura. Bibasal opacities are present, unchanged. No
interval development of consolidation worrisome for progression
of infectious process has been currently demonstrated.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well.

[**2191-9-1**]: Left upper Extremity Doppler: No evidence of acute
left upper extremity DVT. Left IJ appears chronically occluded
which appears to have been present on [**2191-8-18**] CT.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52**] is a 69 year old woman with a history of cerebral
palsy, developmental delay with cognitive impairment, and
recurrent left pleural effusion s/p placement of Pleu-x catheter
([**3-/2191**]) who presents with cough, shortness of breath and fever.

.
#FEVER: The patient frequently had low grade fevers overnight,
especially on [**8-18**] and [**8-21**] when blood cultures were sent.  Her
WBC count fell from 9 on admission to 3.4 on hospital day 6.
The differential for her fever is wide and includes infectious
and noninfectious etiologies.  In a patient this age with
incontinence suspicion for UTI was high and supported by a
urinary analysis with 6-10 WBCs and bacteria.  By hospital day
3, she had developed suprapubic tenderness. Pulmonary infections
were also considered including empyema in the setting of an
increasing lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion with
loculation.  However, interventional pulmonology reported that
the foci of air on CT was likely related to manipulation of the
catheter.  The patient is at risk for aspiration due to
swallowing difficulty and presents with a cough making pneumonia
a consideration.  However, the cough seemed to involve the upper
respiratory tract with no abnormal lung sounds, normal serum
WBC, and serum lactate.  Wounds and skin lesions were assessed,
cleaned, and redressed regularly.  No erythema or induration.
Pt did not have any diarrhea or abdominal pain or rigidity.

Noninfectious causes were unl
