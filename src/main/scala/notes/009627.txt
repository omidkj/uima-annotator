Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: Transferred from OSH for management of respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69 yo M with h/o myelofibrosis, hepatosplenomegaly, COPD
who is transferred here from [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] for further
management of his hemoptysis, CHF, leukocytosis, and
thrombocytopenia.  He initially presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**2116-5-1**] with complaints of weakness, inability to walk and
shortness of breath x 1 week.  In the ED, he was found to have a
WBC of >100,000 and platelet count of 28,000.  He was followed
by heme/onc and pulmonary.  He was started on hydrea and
allopurinol and WBC responded decreasing to the 30's.  He was
also noted to have a RLL opacity on CXR thus was started
ceftriaxone on [**5-3**].  Sputum culutre grew out Klebsiella
pneumonia and he was switched from Ceftriaxone to avelox on
[**5-5**].  He then developed hemoptysis in the setting of
thrombocytopenia, however per family he has had small amounts of
hemoptysis for the past 6 months.  From a respiratory standpoint
he was still saturating well at this point, however CT chest on
[**5-7**] showed extensive ground glass infiltrates in the right lung
field and scattered on the left.  Given the worsening hemoptysis
concern was for DAH vs CHF vs PNA.  He was started on IV
solumedrol, diuresed and initially improved.  He had persistent
hemoptysis and required blood and platelet transfusions.
.
Then on [**5-10**] he had acute onset of respiratory distress.  CXR
showed patchy infiltrates with no obvious CHF.  Because of his
respiratory status he required intubation. He underwent
bronchoscopy which showed BAL with blood from RML, and BAL sent
for multiple studies including cultures, fungal, AFB, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 13607**], cytology, cell count.  PA catheter was placed which
demonstrated PCWP of 14, PA 44/20.  Started on PS for vent
settings.  CXR showed pulm edema vs ARDS.

Pertinent Results:
CXR- Diffuse fluffy infiltrate on the right side in upper and
lower fields, left lower lobe infiltrate.  PA catheter in zone 2
.
ECG- NSR- 93, nl axis, nl intervals, TWF in III, II, avF (old),
no ST, TW changes from old ECG
.
CXR: diffuse interstitial infiltrates bilaterally and fluffy
alveolar infiltrates in the right lung, small left pleural
effusion.
.

ECHO [**2116-5-4**] EF 65% nl LV, AV sclerotic, trace MR, RV nl
.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The gallbladder is not
distended and there is no evidence of stones or sludge. There is
a mild amount of pericholecystic fluid. There is mild
gallbladder wall thickening. The common bile duct measures 7 mm,
which is age appropriate. The liver demonstrates no focal
textural abnormalities. The portal vein is patent with
appropriate hepatopetal flow. Visualized portions of the right
kidney and pancreas are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Gallbladder wall thickening. While this can be seen in
cholecystitis, there are no other findings to support this (such
as gallstones or gallbladder distention) the differential
diagnosis includes hypoalbuminemia, CHF, cirrhosis, pancreatitis
and hepatitis. Further evaluation could be performed with HIDA
scan if warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year-old man with history of myelofibrosis, COPD and
hepatosplenomegaly who was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] for management of hemoptysis, CHF, respiratory
failure, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia and who is now being
transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for tracheostomy and PEG
placement.
.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2116-5-1**]
with complaints of weakness, inability to walk and shortness of
breath for one week. In the ED, he was found to have a WBC of
>100,000 and platelet count of 28,000. He was followed by
Heme-Onc and Pulmonary consult services. He was started on
hydrea and allopurinol, with his WBC decreasing to the 30's. He
was also noted to have a RLL opacity on CXR and on [**2116-5-3**] was
started on ceftriaxone. A sputum culutre grew out Klebsiella
pneumonia and he was switched from Ceftriaxone to moxifloxacin
on [**5-5**]. He then developed hemoptysis in the setting of
thrombocytopenia, although according to family members he has
had small amounts of hemoptysis for the past 6 months. A CT
chest on [**5-7**] showed extensive ground glass infiltrates in the
right lung field and scattered on the left. Given the worsening
hemoptysis, there was a concern for DAH vs CHF vs PNA. He was
started on IV solumedrol, diuresed and initially improved. He
had persistent hemoptysis and required blood and platelet
transfusions.
.
On [**5-10**] he had the acute onset of respiratory distress with new
hypoxia. CXR showed patchy infiltrates with no obvious CHF. He
required intubation and subsequently underwent a bronchoscopy
which revealed blood from RML. A BAL was sent for multiple
studies including cultures, fungal, AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 13607**],
cytology, and cell count. A PA catheter was placed which
demonstrated PCWP of 14, PA 44/20. Started on PS for vent
settings. CXR showed pulm edema vs ARDS.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was continued on the ventilator and
eventually weaned and extubated on [**2116-5-19**]. Sputum cultures from
[**5-12**] grew MRSA and he was started on vancomycin and zosyn on
[**2116-5-11**]. A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2116-5-15**] which revealed
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. PCWP remained elevated in 14-15
range, suggesting coexisting congestive heart failure and the
patient was diuresed. After extubation he had stable oxygen
saturations on 4L and he was called out to the floor, but at
that time had another episode of respiratory distress and stayed
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He did well until [**5-26**] when had tachypnea and
hypoxia and was reintubated. He was continued on Zosyn and
vancomycin and is currently on day 20, though continues to spike
fevers. He was recently placed on a lasix drip on [**5-29**] for
volume overload, with reasonable urine output but this was
stopped today due to hypernatremia and hypokalemia. He didn't
tolerate lasix drip previously related to hypotension.

He was transferred to the MICU [**Hospital Ward Name **] for trach and PEG by
the surgical service. However, Oncology noted the extrememly
poor prognosis from his underlying disease, as well as the lack
of realistic treatments other than bone marrow transplant for
which he is not a candidate. A family meeting was held and the
decision was made to withdraw care the next day on [**2116-6-3**]. He
was extubated and died within an hour with his family at
bedside.
