Service:  C-MED

Dictating for:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
male with a long history of coronary artery disease
(including multiple coronary artery bypass grafts in [**2128**], in
[**2132**], and in [**2159-8-16**]; and several percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasties) who was transferred to
the C-MED Service from the Coronary Care Unit.

The patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital3 2358**] on
[**2159-9-25**] for an episode of substernal chest
discomfort while driving his car to a family event.  In
addition to the chest discomfort, the patient also had the
abrupt onset of shortness of breath and nausea.  All of his
symptoms, except the shortness of breath, were relieved with
sublingual nitroglycerin.

The patient states he had been doing well since his prior CT
surgery back in [**2159-8-16**]; denying any chest pain since
discharge.  He has not noticed any significant decrease in
his exercise tolerance; however, he does admit to some mild
lower extremity swelling and some shortness of breath at
night while lying flat.

An echocardiogram performed at the [**Hospital3 2358**] was
significant for a dilated left ventricle with severe left
ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 15% to
20%, 4+ mitral insufficiency, and trace aortic insufficiency.
He was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.

A diagnostic cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 190**] revealed multivessel disease with elevated
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34.  He was transferred
to the Coronary Care Unit without any intervention at that
time, where he was aggressively diuresed with intravenous
Lasix with a subsequent relief of his shortness of breath
symptoms.  Secondary to decreased blood pressures while in
the Coronary Care Unit, his dose of beta blocker was lowered,
and his blood pressure subsequently normalized.

The patient was then transferred to the C-MED Service for
repeat cardiac catheterization with definitive intervention
and perfusion study.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with acute myocardial infarction
complicated by ventricular fibrillation arrest in [**2128**];
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2128**] of the
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery.
A redo coronary artery bypass graft in [**2132**] with saphenous
vein graft to right coronary artery and saphenous vein graft
to first diagonal.  A redo coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2159-8-16**] with left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending artery, radial to posterior descending
artery, saphenous vein graft to first diagonal, saphenous
vein graft to first obtuse marginal to second obtuse
marginal.
2.  Hepatitis B (acquired through a blood transfusion).
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Left bundle-branch block.
5.  Congestive heart failure by echocardiogram with 15%
ejection fraction.
6.  Mitral regurgitation (4+ by echocardiogram in [**2159-8-16**]).

ALLERGIES:  The patient states he has a PENICILLIN allergy
which causes a rash.  He also states that MORPHINE drops his
blood pressure significantly.  CODEINE, SULFA, IODINE, and
new allergy to RAPID INTRAVENOUS BENADRYL INFUSION; stating
that he had throat tightness.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's vital
signs revealed a temperature of 98, blood pressure
was 100/64, heart rate was 89, respiratory rate was 18.  He
had an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.  In general, he
was a very pleasant man, sitting in a chair, in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed no carotid bruits that were identifiable.  No
jugular venous distention was appreciated.  His neck was
supple, and sclerae were anicteric.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a diminished first heart sound, second
heart sound, and a possible third heart sound gallop heard
occasionally.  Tachycardic with a [**2-21**] to 3/6 systolic
ejection murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border
and right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids.
The murmur was heard over the entire precordial region.
There was also a possible diastolic component as well.  Lung
examination revealed lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, with present bowel sounds.  The extremities
revealed 1+ lower extremity edema, cool, but well perfused,
with 1 to 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
findings on transfer revealed the patient had a white blood
cell count of 4.3, hematocrit was 34.1, platelets were 178.
Sodium was 141, potassium was 4, chloride was 106,
bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 21, creatinine
was 0.6, with a blood glucose of 100.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On hospital day seven, the patient was
returned to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for
definitive treatment of his substernal chest discomfort.

His first diagnostic cardiac catheterization revealed an 80%
stenosis at the saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal jump
graft at the touchdown of the second obtuse marginal.  A
functional assessment of the stenosis was performed using a
pressure wire showing a pressure gradient across the stenosis
decreased from 0.79 to 0.69.  The patient underwent
successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
plus stent of the saphenous vein graft to first obtuse
marginal to second obtuse marginal at the touchdown of the
second obtuse marginal segment.  Overall, he tolerated the
procedure quite well.

On arrival to the floor, the patient was somewhat dizzy and
moderately hypotensive; however, this quickly resolved
without any intervention needed.  Subsequent electrolytes,
and hematocrits, and cardiac enzymes were all stable and
within normal limits.

On hospital day eight, the patient was chest pain free, doing
quite well, fully ambulatory, and without any symptoms of
shortness of breath.  He was felt to be stable for discharge
home at this time.

During his hospital course, the patient did have one episode
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (a 6-beat run).  He
was asymptomatic during this episode and spontaneously
converted to a normal sinus rhythm.  No further intervention
was necessary at this time.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   The patient was to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in his outpatient cardiac clinic as needed for
adjustment of his blood pressure medications.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Zestril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. (times 30 days).
4.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post three coronary
artery bypass grafts.
2.  Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty plus stent to the saphenous vein graft to first
obtuse marginal to second obtuse marginal at the second
obtuse marginal touchdown.
3.  Hepatitis B.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Left bundle-branch block.
6.  Congestive heart failure by echocardiogram with 15%
ejection fraction.
7.  Mitral regurgitation (4+ on echocardiogram).
