EKG: AFib with LAD normal int. V4-V6 TWI
.
CXR: [**2148-5-30**]:
AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There are bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right. There is a left
lower lobe opacity. The pulmonary vasculature does not appear
engorged. There is [**Hospital1 **]-apical scarring. The patient is status
post CABG. There is calcification of the mitral annulus.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right
with left lower lobe associated opacity. The opacification of
the left lower lung field may be secondary to the pleural
effusion and/or an underlying lung process suggests pneumonia.
.
Imaging: 524/07; Portable Abdomen:
UPRIGHT AND SUPINE VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN: Patient is status post
CABG. Chest is better evaluated on the dedicated chest film.
Multiple loops of air and stool-filled colon are seen.
Overlapping loops of small and large bowel containing air are
present in the mid abdomen. Oral contrast is seen within the
small bowel. There is a chronic left superior pubic ramus
fracture. There are extensive vascular calcifications. There is
a scoliotic curvature of the thoracolumbar spine convex right
with extensive degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. Please refer to the
CT scan reported separately for further detail.
.
[**2148-5-30**]: CT Chest abd pelvis:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are bilateral layering
pleural effusions. There is associated compressive atelectasis.
There are extensive coronary artery calcifications affecting all
three vessels. There is mitral annular calcification.
There is a small perihepatic fluid. There is a focal 10 mm area
of
hypo-enhancement in the right lobe of the liver (series 2, image
20), too small to characterize. There is periportal edema, a
nonspecific finding. The gallbladder is nearly completely
decompressed. Pancreas and spleen are unremarkable. There
appears to be thickening of the left adrenal gland. Right
adrenal gland is unremarkable. The left native kidney is
atrophic. There is a 1.5 cm cyst at the interpolar region of the
right kidney. There is no right-sided hydronephrosis. Loops of
small and large bowel are of normal caliber. There is thickening
of the cecum. The ascending and transverse colons appear normal.
Descending colon is difficult to assess due to the presence of
adjacent ascites in the left pericolic gutter. There is also
thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum, with adjacent fatty
stranding. There is no intra-abdominal free air, pneumatosis, or
portal venous gas. There are extensive calcifications of the
aorta and iliac arteries. There are calcifications at the
origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Foley catheter is within a
decompressed bladder. Rectum and sigmoid colon demonstrate wall
thickening with adjacent inflammatory changes.
.
BONE WINDOWS: There is a healed left inferior and left superior
pubic ramus fractures. There are extensive degenerative changes
of the spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Thickening of the cecum, rectum, and sigmoid colon consistent
with colitis.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Extensive atherosclerotic disease.
4. Small ascites and body wall edema consistent with anasarca
.
[**2148-5-30**]- TTE
Conclusions:
The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mi
