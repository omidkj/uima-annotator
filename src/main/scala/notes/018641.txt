Patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of asthma,
who was previously hospitalized for severe respiratory
distress requiring intubation.  [**Hospital **] hospital course was
prolonged complicated by congestive heart failure and MRSA
pneumonia.  Patient had a prolonged wean from the ventilator
at the time requiring a tracheostomy.  Patient was eventually
decannulated and was discharged to home when he represented
in [**2129-2-20**] with respiratory distress again requiring
intubation.  On bronchoscopy at that time he was found to
have significant subglottic stenosis and a trach tube was
placed.

Again, his hospital course was complicated by MRSA
respiratory infection as well as GI bleeding and non-ST-
elevation myocardial infarction.  At that time he underwent
cardiac catheterization revealing nonsignificant coronary
artery disease and no lesions requiring intervention.  He was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] and evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for the subglottic
stenosis.  He is found to have a near complete obstruction of
his upper airway at the level of first and second tracheal
ring with some degree of involvement of the anterior coracoid
on rigid bronchoscopy.

On flexible bronchoscopy, he was found to have no disease at
the stomal site or distally.  At that time, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] was
consulted and patient was advised to undergo a surgical
resection of the stenosis and reconstruction.  Patient after
understanding fully the risks and benefits involved to the
undergo the elective surgery and presents to the operating
room on [**5-24**].

4.  Zestril 20 mg q.d.
5.  Paxil 20 mg q.d.
6.  Norvasc 10 mg q.d.
7.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d.
11. Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Patient reports no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient has immigrated from [**Country **] and is a
bus driver in [**State 350**].  He smoked one pack a day of
cigarettes for 16 years and has quit in [**2106**].  He does not
drink a significant amount of alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient has stable vital signs.  Thin
male, who appears quite healthy and not in no apparent
distress at the time of examination with trach mask collar
with humidified air.  He is unable to speak.  HEENT exam is
within normal limits.  Cervical examination reveals no
supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.  The ostomy site is
well healed around the indwelling trach tube.  Lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular, rate,
and rhythm.  S1, S2 without murmurs.  Thorax is symmetrical
without lesions or masses.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Extremities shows no clubbing or edema.
Neurologically the patient is grossly intact.

CT scan from [**2129-4-21**] shows a subglottic stenosis at the
level of the anterior coracoid down to approximately [**2-22**]
tracheal rings.  Otherwise, the rest of the airway tracheal
rings were within normal limits.  There was also noted a
small ________ nodule, which appears to be benign.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Patient's last hematocrit was 30 with a
white count of 5, platelets was 165.  PT was 13.9, PTT 36,
BUN was 20, creatinine 1.2.

Patient presented to the OR on [**2129-5-25**] for elective
resection of his subglottic stenosis and reconstruction of
airway.  Patient underwent this procedure without significant
difficulty.  Left the OR intubated and was transferred
directly to the Surgical ICU.  Patient did well there.
Patient was weaned to extubate and was extubated on
postoperative day two.  At the time, patient was also covered
with Vancomycin, Kefzol, and Flagyl prophylactically.

Postoperatively, patient's hematocrit was down to 22.5.
Patient received 2 units of packed red cells with good
response.  After successful extubation, patient's neck
remained flushed.  Patient was transferred to the floor, and
his course on the floor was uncomplicated.  Patient's
Vancomycin was D/C'd and patient continued on Kefzol and
Flagyl for seven day course.

On postoperative day seven, patient underwent a bronchoscopy
for evaluation of his surgical site.  Patient was found to
have a normal anastomosis with granulation tissue, secretions
were noted, which were suctioned.  Patient's neck was D/C'd
from the flexed position.  Patient's previously placed PICC
was D/C'd, and patient was discharged home without any
complications on [**2129-6-1**].

Patient's hypertension was controlled with his usual regimen
while taken at home, and did require a slight adjustment with
increase in Lopressor to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. and hydralazine 20
mg p.o. q.8h.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged with home VNA services.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Subglottic tracheal stenosis.
2. T tube prolonged intubation and tracheostomy.
3. Status post resection of the stenosis and airway
   reconstruction.
4. Hypertension.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Diabetes type 2.
7. Asthma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.  This is increased from his
    usual home dose.
5.  Hydralazine 20 mg p.o. q.8.  This is increased from
    patient's usual home dose.
6.  Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d.
