Admission Date:  [**2113-6-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-7-6**]


Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Progressive exertional dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] is an 85 year-old
gentleman with a history of severe aortic stenosis.  His most
recent echocardiogram was performed on [**2113-4-7**], which
revealed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with an
ejection fraction of 60%.  There was severe aortic stenosis
with a peak gradient of 82 mmHg, mean 55 mmHg and a valve
area of 0.6 cm squared.  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] has noticed shortness
of breath with exertion that has progressed over the past six
to twelve months.  His symptoms have worsened to the point
that he has difficulty walking down the [**Doctor Last Name **].  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**]
was therefore evaluated by cardiac catheterization, which
revealed severe aortic stenosis and elevated filling
pressures.  His LMCA was remarkable for osteal and distal 30%
stenoses, left anterior descending coronary artery 70% mid
stenosed after the mid diagonal.  Left circumflex and right
coronary artery were remarkable for luminal irregularities.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.  Aortic stenosis
and mild MR.  3.  Mild dementia.  4.  Hypothyroidism.  5.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.  6.  Degenerative joint
disease.  7.  Vitamin B-12 deficiency.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  Accupril 40 mg q day, Flomax 0.4 mg q day,
ascorbic acid 500 mg q day, vitamin E 400 IU q.d., calcium
carbonate one po b.i.d., Paxil 30 mg q.h.s., Levothyroxine 25
micrograms q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] lives at the [**Hospital 24979**] [**Hospital **]
Nursing Home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is DNR/DNI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 78.  Blood pressure 112/70.
Head is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Neck is supple with
bilateral systolic carotid bruits.  Heart is regular rate and
rhythm.  Systolic murmur.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities without clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] was taken to the Operating
Room on [**6-28**] for coronary artery bypass graft times one
and aortic valve replacement.  Coronary artery bypass grafts
included a left internal mammary coronary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery.  Aortic valve was
replaced with a 21 mm CERS pericardial valve.  The operation
was performed without complications.  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] was
subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  On the evening of the surgery Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] was
found to have a systolic blood pressure in the 40s and no
pulse could be found.  This event was found to be due to lack
of pacemaker capture.  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] was reintubated and
mechanically ventilated.  The pacemaker began to recapture
spontaneously with good effect on his heart rate and blood
pressure.  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] also had some atrial fibrillation in
the days following surgery, which were controlled with
intravenous medications.  Because Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] remained
dependent on external pacemaker post surgically he was
evaluated by EP who placed an electronic internal pacemaker.
Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] this well and his heart rate and
blood pressure have remained stable since.  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] was
then transferred to the floor on postoperative day six.

His stay on the floor was remarkable for some drainage from
the inferior edge of his wound.  His incision was dressed and
changed accordingly.  Clindamycin was started and will be
continued for a two week course.  On postoperative day eight
Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] is felt to be stable for transfer back to his
nursing home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature 99.4.  Pulse
86.  Blood pressure 130/84.  Respirations 18.  O2 sat 91% on
room air.  His heart is regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities were remarkable for trace edema.  His incision is
dressed, but is dry, clean and intact.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levothyroxine 25 micrograms q day,
Paxil 30 mg q day, calcium carbonate 1000 mg b.i.d., Ascorbic
acid 500 mg q.d., Tamsulosin 0.4 mg q.h.s, Ipratropium
bromide two puffs IH q.i.d. prn, Docusate 100 mg po b.i.d.,
Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Captopril 50 mg t.i.d., Clindamycin 300
mg q 6 hours times two weeks.  Ibuprofen 600 mg q 8 hours
prn.  Tylenol 500 to 1000 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn, multi
vitamin one tab q day, Lasix 20 mg q.d. times three days.
K-Ciel 20 milliequivalents q day times three days.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) 996**]P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] in four weeks.  He should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1016**] in
three to four weeks.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108767**] is to be discharged to a
nursing home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery
bypass graft times one.
