Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. Male with advanced dementia BIBA from NH with sudden
onset SOB, dyspneic.
.
Pt is unable to provide history given end stage dementia. Per
EMS records they were called to the pt's NH [**Hospital1 599**] [**Location (un) 55**]
after he was noted to be hypoxic to 75% on RA. O2 sat increased
only to 83-89% on 6L, thus pt was placed on a NRB mask.
.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be T102.4, HR 116, BP 124/89,
RR 28, Sat 75% on 15L. Labwork was notable for leukocytosis of
11.3, Hgb/Hct 12.5/41. U/A showed large leuks, large bld, WBC
>182, few bacteria. Lactate was 3.6 with Na 168, BUN/Cr 39/1.9.
CXR was obtained and showed RML PNA. Pt was given Zosyn/Vanc for
broad coverage for PNA as well as UTI. He was also placed on
BiPAP given his hypoxia, given Tylenol for a fever of 102. Right
IJ was placed in the ED.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2200-7-29**]**

   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2200-7-29**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.

Blood culture pending x2

[**7-29**] EKG
Baseline artifact. Probable sinus tachycardia. Left
bundle-branch block with marked left axis deviation. No previous
tracing available for comparison.  Suggest repeat tracing and
clinical correlation.

[**7-29**] CXR FINDINGS: The tip of the right IJ line is in the upper
SVC. There is a pacemaker in place. There is no pneumothorax.

Vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema indicate cardiac
dysfunction despite normal heart size. Bibasilar opacification,
more at the left, is either atelectasis or pneumonia. Blunting
of the left costophrenic is most likely a small pleural
effusion.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion.
2. Possible bibasilar pneumonia, suspect aspiration.
3. Right IJ line ends in upper SVC. No pneumothorax or other
complication.

[**7-30**]

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-29**], there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure, small effusions, and bibasilar
atelectatic change, more prominent on the left. The possibility
of supervening pneumonia at the bases cannot be excluded in the
appropriate clinical setting.

Right IJ catheter and pacemaker devices remain in place.

RECORDS OBTAINED FROM [**Hospital6 19335**]:
- CT head [**3-/2199**]: low attenuation of periventricular white
matter, volume loss sulcal and ventrular prominence, no acute
abnml
- CT L spin [**2-/2199**]: DJD, disc bulges
- CT head [**2-/2199**]: advanced chronic microvascular ischemic
changes, atherosclerosis of ICA
- [**2200-7-11**] D/c summary for hypernatremia and UTI -- admitted
with fever 101, AMS, serum Na 171, UA with UTI. Free H2O deficit
10L, Na was 150 and pt advanced to PO food/water. Given CTX x5
days for UTI and pt defervesced. Had Troponin leak. Palliative
care consulted (severe baseline dementia, CVA, no longer
oriented. Fully dependent on others for care, says very few
words at baseline; comfort focused care suggested to family and
"do not hospitalize" also suggested)
- echo [**5-/2191**]: mild hypertrophy of LV, severe inferior HK,
40-45%, dilated aortic root, 1+ MR, moderate LAE, mod TR, PASP
36, [**Last Name (un) **]
- echo [**2-/2199**]: 40-45%, LVH, mild [**Doctor Last Name **], no signficant valvular
disease,
otherwise not much different from previous, again visualized R
