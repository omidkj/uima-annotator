Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Balloon enteroscopy

History of Present Illness:
81yo M w/ PMHx of CHF (EF <45% on [**5-17**] ECHO), recent DVT in left
arm [**1-8**] PICC on heparin SQ and Fe-deficiency anemia w/ recent GI
bleed last month who presents to the ED after capsule endoscopy
showed active bleeding in small bowel. With this report from
capsule endoscopy, the patient was referred by GI to the ED for
admission and further evaluation/treamtent for possible balloon
enteroscopy.
.
Of note, the patient previously had a colonoscopy and endoscopy
when he initially presented with GI bleed; neither of which were
able to identify a source of bleeding, leading to capsule
endoscopy. The patient reports that since his first episode of
bloody stool, he has not had any other bowel movements with
frank blood.  He does endorse black tarry stools. He denies
abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, and hematemesis. He endorses
some constipation. Today, he reports feeling some dizziness,
particularly when he moves from a sitting position to standing
or sometimes when walking. He endorses poor appetite but has not
had weight loss. He does not use Ibuprofen and has stopped
taking his daily ASA (although he is unsure when he stopped this
medication). The patient continues to be on heparin SQ for
treatment of his DVT.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 97.8 P 81 BP 102/52 R 16 O2 sat
97%RA. Patient was type and screened. He was given 1L NS and 1
unit of pRBCs in the ED.
.
In the unit, when the patient arrived, initial VS were T 96.7 HR
88 BP 103/90 RR 17 O2 Sat 97% RA. He was conversant and
answering questions appropriately. Transfusion of 1 unit of
pRBCs was finishing when the patient arrived to the unit.

Left upper extremity Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
Non-occlusive clot in one branch of the left brachial vein
without extension
into the axillary vein.
***
Small Bowel Enteroscopy:
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Jejunum:  A circumferential friable mass of about 4-5 cm in
length with luminal narrowing and areas of ulceration was noted
in mid/distal jejunum. However the scope was able to pass the
area of narrowing. A retained capsule was noted in that area.
Retrieval of the capsule was not possible due to the angulation
of the scope and the resultant difficulty in passing instruments
down the scope channel. The area was tattooed with 2 cc.[**Country 11150**]
ink with success. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology at the mid/distal jejunum at the site of the mass.
Impression: A circumferential friable mass of about 4-5 cm in
length with luminal narrowing and areas of ulceration was noted
in mid/distal jejunum. However the scope was able to pass the
area of narrowing. A retained capsule was noted in that area.
Retrieval of the capsule was not possible due to the angulation
of the scope and the resultant difficulty in passing instruments
down the scope channel. These findings are compatible with a
small bowel tumor. (injection, biopsy)
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid/distal jejunum
Recommendations: Await biopsy results.
Clear liquids today and advance diet as tolerated tomorrow.


Brief Hospital Course:
81yo M w/ PMHx of CHF (EF <35% on [**5-17**] ECHO), recent DVT in left
arm [**1-8**] PICC on heparin SQ and Fe-deficiency anemia w/ recent GI
bleed last month who presents to the ED after capsule endoscopy
showed active bleeding in small bowel for further management.
.
#GI Bleed/ Acute blood loss anemia: Capsule endoscopy showing
active bleeding in the small bowel. Of note, patient recently
had a CT abdomen/pelvis that showed a segment of abnormal bowel
wall thickening involving the midline small bowel, which has a
dilated appearance and is adjacent to several prominent
mesenteric lymph nodes. This appearance of aneurysmal dilation
of small bowel is concerning for small bowel lymphoma. He was
taken for small bowel endoscopy but the study was unrevealing,
perhaps not reaching the area noted on the CT to be abnormal.
Patient reports dark, tarry stools, but has not had frank blood
in his stools. He reports some dizziness when sitting up and
when standing/walking. On admission, he was made NPO in
anticipation for procedure by GI and continued on protonix 40mg
IV q24hrs. GI was consulted and recommended balloon enteroscopy.
The procedure revealed a friable tissue mass consistent with
distal small bowel tumor. Biopsies were performed.  Final
pathology report of the biopsy is pending, however preliminary
report is suggestive of malignancy, most likely lymphoma.
Surgery was consulted and discussed with the patient the
possiblity of going to surge
