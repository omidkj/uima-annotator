ECG Study Date of [**2136-6-29**]  9:52:00 PM

Sinus bradycardia. Q-T interval prolonged for rate. Poor R wave
progression consistent with old anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-6-23**] sinus bradycardia
has replaced atrial fibrillation. Q-T interval prolonged for
rate is new raising the possibility of medication effect or
metabolic abnormality. ST-T wave abnormalities in leads III,
aVF, V3-V5 are somewhat more marked.  Suggest clinical
correlation and repeat tracing.

ECG Study Date of [**2136-7-3**]  2:28:18 PM
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Prior
anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2136-6-9**] atrial
fibrillation has recurred. The T wave inversion in leads III,
aVF and V3-V6 may have psuedonormalized in the context of
increased rate. Rule out active ischemic process. Followup and
clinical correlation are suggested.



FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT Study Date of [**2136-6-29**] 8:45 PM
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis. Diffuse
soft tissue
swelling. No subcutaneous gas.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT Study Date of [**2136-6-29**] 10:19 PM
IMPRESSION: No DVT in right lower extremity.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2136-7-1**] 10:26 AM
IMPRESSION: Interval clearing of congestive heart failure with
very small
residual pleural effusions.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT) Study Date of [**2136-7-4**] 9:19 AM
FINDINGS: Bilateral cephalic, basilic, and greater saphenous
veins were evaluated with B-mode ultrasound. On the right arm,
the cephalic vein is patent with diameters ranging between 0.16
and 0.09 cm. The right basilic vein is patent with diameters
ranging between 0.09 and 0.5 cm.

On the left arm, the left cephalic vein is patent with diameters
ranging
between 0.22 and 0.39 cm. The left basilic vein is patent with
diameters
ranging between 0.15 and 0.39 cm.

In the right lower extremity, calcification was visualized at
the proximal
portion of the greater saphenous vein and was identified at the
level of the midcalf. The right greater saphenous vein is patent
with diameters ranging between 0.42 and 0.92. The right lesser
saphenous vein is patent with diameters ranging between 0.17 and
0.64.

On the left lower extremity, calcifications were seen at the
greater saphenous vein below the level of the knee. The left
greater saphenous vein is patent with diameters ranging between
0.16 and 0.60 cm. The left lesser saphenous vein is patent with
diameters ranging between 0.11 and 0.22 cm.

IMPRESSION: Patent bilateral cephalic, basilic, greater
saphenous and lesser saphenous veins with diameters described
above.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2136-7-6**] 9:06 AM
Suboptimal. Lower lung volumes. Increase in bibasilar opacities,
more
on the right, likely atelectasis or effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
[**2136-6-29**] DOA Patient admitted via ED for non-healing bilateral
hallux ulcers. Started broad spectrum antibiotics
(Vanco/Levo/Flagyl). Routine nursing care, home meds, labs.
Right foot x-rays done -showed-No radiographic evidence of
osteomyelitis,diffuse soft tissue swelling. No subcutaneous gas.
Right LE US- showed no DVT. Podiatry consulted-recs multipodus
boot to RLE, wound care- NS wet-dry [**Hospital1 **], will follow.

[**Date range (1) **]/09 HD1-2 VSS. Pr-oped (CXR, ECG) for angiogram. IV
hydration with bicarb and Acetylcystein given.

[**2136-7-3**] HD3 VSS. Taken to angio suite and underwent diagnostic
angiogram. Patient tolerated procedure well, recovered in the
cath lab holding room. Patient was established that she would
require further intervention for revascularization, possibly
bypass. Left groin sheath was removed after transfusion of 1
unit FFP for (INR 2.1), uneventful sheath removal, site w/o
hematoma. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 for further
observation. Patient was on bedrest for the required amount of
time after sheath removal. Post procedure ECG showed atrial
fibrillation w/ controlled rate- no intevention was done patient
was hemodynamically stable.

[**2136-7-4**] HD4 PAD1 VSS. Left groin access site remain clear, no
hematoma. Vein mapping was done- that showed right arm, the
cephalic vein is patent diameters 0.16 and 0.09 cm.
Basilic-patent diameters 0.09 and 0.5 cm. left arm- cephalic
vein-patent diameters 0.22 and 0.39 cm, basilic- patent
diameters 0.15 and 0.39 cm. RLE-calcification at the proximal
portion of the GSV and at the level of midcalf, diameters
between 0.42 and 0.92. The RLSV- patent, diameters between 0.17
and 0.64. L LE greater saphenous vein is patent w/
calcifications below the knee level. Diameters ranging between
0.16 and 0.60 cm. The left LSV is patent with diameters between
0.11 and 0.22 cm. Patient was pre-oped and consented for L LE
bypass. Social work consulted to help with family coping.
Patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red cells for low
