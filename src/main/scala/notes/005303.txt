Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zocor / Lescol

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line insertion (right internal jugular vein)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] is an 84 yo man with moderate aortic stenosis (outside
hospital echo in [**2124**] with [**Location (un) 109**] 1 cm2, gradient 28 mmHg, moderate
mitral regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency), chronic left
ventricular systolic heart failure with EF 25-30%, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, CAD s/p CABG in [**2099**] with
SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RPDA-RPL, with a re-do CABG in
[**9-/2117**] with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA. He also
has severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass
surgery. He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER this morning with
shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart
failure.

He states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last
evening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed
moderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest
associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. The pain was
fairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sL NTG at
6 am by EMS. He has been pain free since. Presenting vitals BP
109/66, HR 71, O2 sat 88% on RA. CXR showed congestive heart
failure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, CK 70.
He given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg IV (with ~600cc diuresis),
Nitropaste [**1-3**]", and Lovenox 80 mg SQ. During the ambulance
transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], he also received ~500 cc IVF for ? low
BP).

On further questioning, Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] has very poor exercise
tolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis.
But he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last
night) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat,
carrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to
walk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated
with dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. His symptoms
occur about every day to every other day and have been stable
over the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify
the amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and
feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.

ROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several
months ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and
currently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG twice (vide infra).
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Peripheral arterial disease with occluded left common iliac
artery, S/P right iliac artery stenting and femoral-to-femoral
bypass, further angioplasty to the right profunda.
5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic LV systolic heart
failure, reported LVEF 25-30%.
6. Moderate-severe aortic stenosis.
7. Osteoarthritis.

CAD: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension

Cardiac History: CABG in [**2099**] (SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and
SVG-RPDA-RPL), with a re-do CABG in [**9-/2117**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,
SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA)

Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2120**] anatomy as follows:
Patent SVG to OM1, patent SVG to PDA which filled the distal PDA
as well as the R-PL via a jump segment. Stump occlusion of a
graft presumably to the right system as well as one stump that
could be documented of a graft to the left. Other SVG's were not
able to be selectively engaged. Supravalvular aortography
demonstrated no other patent grafts. Patent LIMA to mid-LAD,
which also back-perfused the diagonal via a patent jump graft
that was interposed between the LAD and the diagonal.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is extensive family history of early coronary disease
(father died of MI at 44, one brother died in 40's, one in 50's,
sister had stroke).

ECG [**2125-2-9**]  9:36:38 PM
Rhythm is most likely sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular
premature beats with occasional ventricular bigeminal pattern.
There are also frequent atrial premature beats. Intraventricular
conduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave
changes most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-4-9**] ventricular premature
beats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

CXR [**2125-2-9**]: The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG.
The heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the
previous study.  Bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward
the lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate- to-severe
pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusion is present, also
new, most likely part of the heart failure.   Left and right
retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.

ECHO [**2125-2-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl
walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF
= 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images
unavailable of [**2119-5-8**], left ventricular systolic function is now
depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.
