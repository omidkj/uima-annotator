Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11552**]
Chief Complaint:
cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, placement of temporary dialysis catheter

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year old type I diabetic, ESRD, admitted
with acute onset of shortness of breath and hemoptysis at 9AM.
She was nauseated and had vomiting and dry-heaved in the morning
with blood-tinged vomitus vs. emesis. She denied chest pain,
fevers, chills prior to admission. Per patient's daughter, she
had been noted to be coughing recently, however, did not
complain of fevers or chills to her daugher. No myalgias. No
sick contacts.

In the ED, vitasl were T 96.5F, BP 174/137, HR 96, RR 38, T
100.6, 97% on NRB. She was given lasix and nitroglycerin drip,
and placed on BIPAP. A chest x ray revealed RLL pneumonia, so
she was started on vanco/cefepime/levaquin, and so was intubated
because of concern for PNA. A right IJ was placed.

IMAGING
Admission CXR: New large left lower lobe pneumonia.

TTE:The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global
hypokinesis. The basal inferolateral and anterior walls contract
best (LVEF = 20 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with hypokinesis of the distal half of the free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-4-17**],
the findings are similar.

CT neck: CONCLUSION: Extensive enlargement of the left
sternocleidomastoid muscle with heterogeneous density. In the
absence of obvious signs for infection, either clinically or
radiologically, the finding could potentially be either a
neoplastic or some other type of fibromatous process.
As we discussed by telephone, as it would be potentially
hazardous to
administer either iodinated contrast or gadolinium-DTPA
intravenously,
alternative imaging strategies could include a non-contrast MRI
scan of the neck, which can only be undertaken when there is
clarification that the aneurysm clip is MR compatible.
Additionally, [**Name (NI) 13416**] would offer a very efficacious means to
safely image this abnormality.

U/S Neck: Diffuse expansion and abnormal echogenicity and
hyperemia to the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Findings could
be compatible with a myositis. Alternatively, hematoma would be
a differential consideration in the appropriate setting. If
there are no contraindications, MRI without contrast (given the
patient's history of end- stage renal disease) could potentially
assist with further characterization.

[**2161-12-3**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity with air bronchograms,
consistent with LLL pneumonic infiltrate.
