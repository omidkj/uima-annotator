REASON FOR TRANSFER:  Second orthopedic opinion status post
hip fracture.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female
with multiple medical problems including coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who initially presented to the  [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital on [**2150-4-25**], after suffering a
left hip fracture (displaced subcapital fracture).  This
occurred as a result of a mechanical fall, apparently related
to left leg weakness the patient attributed to her diabetic
neuropathy.  On admission to [**Hospital3 417**] she was placed in
Bucks traction while various medical workup occurred in
preparation for planned unipolar hemiarthroplasty.  She was
given a course of amoxicillin for "bronchitis."  Urine grew
Klebsiella and E. coli although the patient reported "chronic
UTIs" and it is unclear whether she had thrombocytopenia
(platelets 60's) so the Hematology Service was consulted.
They felt she should be transfused with platelets before and
after the surgery.  The Cardiology Service was consulted and
felt she could safely undergo hip arthroplasty without
further preoperative coronary evaluation.  Unfortunately,
although medically cleared for surgery, the patient by that
time had developed a significant coccygeal decubitus ulcer.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Rehab on [**4-29**] for
aggressive wound care in the hopes that hip surgery could be
performed around the end of [**Month (only) **].

At [**Hospital1 **] Rehab careful wound care of the
coccygeal decubitus ulcer was provided.  She completed her
seven day course of amoxicillin.  Chest x-ray on [**4-30**]
showed a left infiltrate with effusion, and borderline
congestive heart failure.  Follow-up x-rays showed worsening
of the infiltrate and effusion and aspiration pneumonia was
suspected, so Flagyl was begun on [**5-7**].  Her TSH was
elevated (felt to be secondary to amiodarone) and her
Synthroid was increased from 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg q. day.  On
[**5-8**] the Orthopedic Service saw her and discontinued the
Bucks traction.

She was transferred here today for second opinion regarding
the hip surgery.  The patient is very eager to have the hip
repaired and complains mostly of hip pain and related leg
muscle spasm.  She denies dyspnea or chest pain.  She has had
a cough that she says is old and chronic; minimal sputum
production was reported.  Her appetite is poor and she has
been receiving TPN.  She says that she "ate a little bit"
yesterday for the first time in days.  The coccygeal ulcer
does not bother her currently.
