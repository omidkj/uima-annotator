Microbiology:

   Respiratory Viral Culture (Preliminary): NEGATIVE
   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2112-1-13**]):
      Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.

MRSA ([**2112-1-12**]): NEGATIVE
.
Imaging:
CXR [**2112-1-13**]- The tip of a right-sided PICC line is difficult to
visualize but is probably unchanged. The lung volumes remain
low. There is an extensive consolidation in the right lower
lung, probably in the right lower lobe. The appearance is fairly
similar to the more recent prior radiographs allowing for
differences in technique although pulmonary vasculature is
somewhat less prominent. It is difficult to exclude small
pleural effusions but no definite pleural effusion is seen. The
cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
including cardiac enlargement.
  IMPRESSION:
  1. Persistent consolidation in the right lower lung worrisome
for pneumonia.  Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show
resolution within eight weeks.
  2. Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion but seemingly
improved.
.
Foot Xray [**2112-1-13**] -
1. Osseous erosive changes are noted at the right first
interphalangeal joint at the base of the distal right first
phalanx may represent changes of inflammatory or crystalline
arthritis or osteomyelitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
If there is clinical concern for osteomyelitis, consider
correlation with right foot or forefoot MRI.
2. Prior fracture deformity through the distal diaphysis of
right second
metatarsal.
3. Prior resection changes involving distal third left
metatarsal and  proximal portion of third proximal phalanx and
prior amputation of the mid shaft second metatarsal and
phalanges and partial metatarsal and proximal
first left phalangeal digit amputation. Interval decreased soft
tissue gas at prior resection site involving the left forefoot
without signs of periostitis or new osseous erosion. If clinical
concern for left foot osteomyelitis, consider left forefoot MRI.

Video Swallow [**2112-1-14**] - IMPRESSION: No gross aspiration, but
penetration was seen with thin liquids. For full detail, please
