Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8480**]
Chief Complaint:
Primary:
1. Hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Micro suspension laryngoscopy
CO2 laser left arytenoidectomy and cordotomy
Tracheotomy tube change

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 40 year old female with Hx of Asthma diagnosed at 9
mo old with multiple exacerbations requiring tracheostomy for
nearly 20 years. Pt has been having voice horseness and was
evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and felt to have vocal cord
paralysis and webbing that were making breathing and speaking
difficult. Pt was undergoing laser aretenoidectomy yesterday,
complicated by intraoperative O2 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
vent weaning. Last pm, the patient was noted to have pain around
the trachea, but denied any SOB, N/V, CP, abdominal pain or leg
pain.
.
Since admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient has been weaned from
the vent successfully and has been assessed to be stable without
any respiratory distress or dyspnea. The patient is currently
with O2 sats 100% on 40% O2 face mask over her trach with plans
to continue titrating down O2 requirements. At baseline the
patient breathes room air and does not require supplementary
oxygen. This am, she was found to have increased wheezing but
did not tolerate initial albuterol nebulizer treatments
secondary to nausea and vomiting x1. She was given Dolasetron
and has since tolerated the treatment. She currently reports she
is comfortable, able to eat and drink, and denies any shortness
of breath, chest pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or any other
problems.
.
Discussion with patient's primary care physician revealed that
the patient was on Flovent on presentation to the PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
regards to her history of "heart attacks" the PCP reports she
was told the same history but has no objective evidence to
support this. A stress echo performed recently revealed RVH, but
no evidence of cardiac ischemia and recent PFTs showed mild
obstructive pulmonary pathology but did not comment of degree of
reversibility. Patient additionally has reported history of
seizure disorder which entails one seizure in her lifetime. The
patient was previously on Neurontin, but self-discontinued the
medication 4 months ago.
.
Allergies: Penicillins

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History (from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] notes and conversation with PCP)
1. Asthma - Patient was diagnosed with severe asthma at 9 months
of age with multiple exacerbations of her disease. At the age of
12 years old, the patient, apparently, went into respiratory
failure for which she ended up to be intubated multiple times
until she had a tracheostomy tube placed. The tracheostomy tube
stayed in the patient until the age of 18, according to her
report. It was taken out for almost six months and then it was
replaced until she was 21 years of age.
2. Cardiac disease - unknown. The patient states that she has
suffered three "heart attacks" that were caused by her asthma as
well as two comas during these years. No objective evidence
available to support.
3. Glottic stenosis: Patient assessed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
arytenoidectomy as above.
4. Possible seizure disorder - 1 seizure, previously on
neurontin, now off x 4months
5. Depression - previously treated with Wellbutrin
6. GERD

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  Patient is a 40 year old female with a history of severe
asthma requiring mutiple previous intubations and tracheostomy,
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for episode of hypoxia while undergoing left
laser arytenoidectomy for glottic stenosis.
.
1. Hypoxia - The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for episode
of hypoxia and was weaned from the ventilator, receiving oxygen
via face mask over her trach. The patient was sat'ing 100% with
a 40% face mask and was transferred to the Geriatrics A medical
service for monitoring and control of her asthma before
discharge. Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was stable
without resporatory distress or hypoxia and was weaned
completely from oxygen. She was with O2 sats > 95% without O2
and was mobile and comfortable. On [**2134-8-21**], the ENT service
replaced her trach tube with a more durable metal trach without
incident. The patient was discharged to home with further follow
up and care to be arranged with her PCP.
.
2. Asthma - Patient has a history of severe asthma, previously
on Fluticasone as an outpatient. The patient was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] as described above and was weaned from the vent. The
patient was noted on [**2134-8-20**] to have some increased wheezing
but did not tolerate an albuterol nebulizer seconday to nausea.
The patient was given some anti-emetics and did tolerate an
albuterol nebulizer with resolution of her wheezing. Upon
transfer to the floor, the patient's lung sounds were relatively
clear and she was continued on Albuterol and Ipratropium
nebulizer as needed in addition to daily Fluticasone. The day of
discharge, the patient's meds were changed to Advair for
maintenance therapy with albuterol inhaler as needed. The
patient had no asthma exacerbations while a patient on the floor
and was discharged to home with Advair and albuterol with follow
up to be completed by her PCP.
