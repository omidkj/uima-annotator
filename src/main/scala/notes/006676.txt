Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2149-6-26**] - Redo sternotomy and first-time aortic valve replacement
with a 21-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease aortic valve bioprosthesis,
model #3300TFX, serial #[**Serial Number 88877**].


History of Present Illness:
80 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation, renal
insufficiency, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease s/p
CABG in [**2127**] that has progressive shortness of breath.  Based on
[**Year (4 digits) 461**] her stenosis has progressively worsened and she
has had worsening edema in her legs over the last week.  She is
able to ambulate short distance but then limited by dyspnea and
legs shaking.  Additionally she has had increased swelling in
legs over the last few weeks and has taken additional lasix at
lunch time.  She now presents for aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2149-6-30**] CT Scan Head
No acute hemorrhage or infarction.

[**2149-6-30**] Carotid Ultrasound
Findings consistent with a 60-69% right ICA stenosis and less
than 40% left ICA stenosis.

[**2149-6-26**] ECHO
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior akinesis.
4. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
7. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is heavy MAC.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of norepinephrine, milrinone. AV pacing
for SR with frequent PVC's. Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in
the aortic position with peak 8, mean 5 mmHg gradient. AI is
trivial. MR remains 1+. LV systolic function is improved
post-cpb on inotropic support. LVEF = 40%. Aortic contour is
normal post decannulation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2149-6-29**] 9:23 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 yo woman with ^O2
requirement/s/p AVr
Final Report:
A right IJ sheath is present, tip over proximal/mid SVC. The
Swan-Ganz
catheter has been removed.
The patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve and
multiple
mediastinal clips. There is moderately severe cardiomegaly.
There is upper
zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
with CHF. There is opacification at the right base, which likely
represents combination of pleural fluid and underlying collapse
and/or consolidation. There is increased density in the
retrocardiac region, but compared with [**2149-6-27**], the left
hemidiaphragm is now visible, suggesting partial interval
clearing.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old woman with known aortic stenosis admitted to cardiac
surgery service for aortic valve replacement with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on
[**2149-6-25**]. She was admitted one day prior to surgery for diuresis.
On [**6-26**] she was brought to the operating room for aortic valve
replacement, please see operative report for details. In summary
she had: Redo sternotomy and first-time aortic valve replacement
with a 21-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease aortic valve bioprosthesis,
model #3300TFX, serial #[**Serial Number 88877**]. Her CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME
was 107 minutes with a CLAMP TIME of 69 minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU on Milrinone,
Levophed, Insulin and Propofol infusions. She was
hemodynamically labile in early post-op course and when she was
allowed to wake she droped her cardiac indices. She was
subsequently resedated. Volume resuscitation including blood
transfusions were given and then she was weaned and extubated
early in the morning of postoperative day one. Inotropes were
weaned off on postoperative day one. All tubes, lines and
drained were removed per cardiac surgery protocol. On
postoperative day two, the pa
