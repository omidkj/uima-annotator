[**1-31**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Limited study, with:

1. CHF with interstitial edema and small left effusion.

2. Possible patchy infiltrates, particularly in the right lung.

3. Left humeral surgical neck fracture.

[**2197-2-4**] CXR:
Single portable radiograph of the chest again demonstrates
marked rotatory S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
The cardiomediastinal contours are similar to that seen on
[**2197-1-31**]. Assessment is limited by respiratory motion, but there
are likely bilateral pleural effusions. Increased opacity
projecting over both lungs is similarly not well assessed, but
likely remains unchanged. The patient is status post median
sternotomy. Remote trauma of the left humeral head and neck is
unchanged.

[**2197-2-2**] ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo Female w/ CAD s/p CABG, dementia, CVA s/p
CEA, HTN, dyslipidemia, DMII who presented from a NH with 5 days
of non-productive cough, low grade fevers, and worsening hypoxia
on RA on the day of admission who was transferred to the CCU for
afib with RVR on hospital day four, with blood pressure not
tolerating nodal agents.

Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo Female w/ CAD s/p CABG, dementia, CVA s/p
CEA, HTN, dyslipidemia, DMII who presented from a NH with 5 days
of non-productive cough, low grade fevers, and worsening hypoxia
on RA on the day of admission. Patient s/p CCU transfer for Afib
w/RVR. Respiratory status improved in the CCU, but rate remains
uncontrolled despite continued increase in beta-blocker.

# Pneumonia: [**Hospital **] hospital-acquired pneumonia vs atypical
pneumonia in setting of acute diastolic heart failure. Admission
CXR with findings consistent with patchy right infiltrates and
curly-b lines, small left pleural effusion, no improvement on
CXR s/p 1.5L diuresis. CXR is complicated by patient's severe
kyphoscoliosis which predisposes to atelectasis. Elevated WBC
with left shift, low grade temps, and pro-BNP elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 890**]
on admission. Unclear precipitant of CHF, as patient has no
recent admissions for CHF (last admit [**3-9**] for hip facture),
and on no standing lasix at NH. On [**2-3**], antibiotics were
broadened to include Zosyn, Vancomycin and a 7 day course was
completed. Atypical coverage with azithromycin was added on [**2-7**]
and 3 day course was completed. Atrovent nebulizers provided
standing with albuterol as needed. Pulmonary status improved on
discharge with decreasing oxygen requirement.

#. CAD - s/p CABG, anatomy unknown. She had diffuse ST
depressions in setting of RVR which resolved when rate in low
100's, likely rate rate related demand ischemia.  During this
admission, aspirin, statin, beta blocker were continued.

#. Pump - EF of >55% on ECHO this admission. Presented in
respiratory distress, with CXR findings consistent with volume
overload, likely acute diastolic heart failure.  Patient was
provided with gentle diuresis as BP tolerated.  Beta blocker,
ACE continued on discharge.

#. Rhythm: Sinus on admission EKG, continue telemetry. Now in
Afib w/ persistent RVR despite amiodarone load in CCU and
transition to po regimen and increased BB. Likely a result of
underlying pulmonary disease and anticipate as lungs improve,
rate will also.  Metoprolol succinate and diltiazem were
titrated to acheive rate control as well as amiodarone 200mg
daily continued. Initiation of coumadin therapy was discussed
with daughter and her PCP and it was felt high risk of fall and
patient's non-compliance with monitoring may outweight benefit.


# HTN: Home regimen includes metoprolol, diltiazem, and
lisinopril. As her hospital course was complicated by
hypotension and ATN, diltiazem and lisinopril were held. When
SBP tolerated, beta blocker, diltiazem, and lisinopril were
resumed.

# Diarrhea: One episode in the setting of broad spectrum
antibiotics. C. diff negative x1 without further episodes of
diarrhea.

# UTI: Urine culture growing E. coli, sensitive to zosyn among
several other antimicrobials. Completed appropriate course.

# Acute renal failure: Creatinine on admission 1.1, high of 2.0
now improved after diuresis. Believed to be prerenal azotemia
with ATN from dropp
