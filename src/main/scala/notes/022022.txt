Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
G-tube clogging, replacement with 22F foley


History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with stage II-III esophageal cancer receiving
treatment with chemoradiation and recently admitted from [**2197-8-3**]
to [**2197-8-8**] for cycle #4 cisplatin/5FU who presents from [**Hospital 7137**] with hypoxia and tachycardia.  During his prior admission,
he tolerated his chemo well although was noted to refuse exams
and vital signs frequently.  He was discharged home with plans
to start G-CSF on day #7.

In the ED, initial vitals were: T 97.4, BP 111/63, HR 137, RR
22, and SpO2 88% on 15L NRB.  Physical exam showed tachypnea
with increased respiratory effort and diffuse rhonchi
throughout.  Labs showed leukocytosis to 26.6 with 92%
neutrophils, sodium 131, bicarb 20, BUN 30, lactate 4.1, and
Troponin < 0.01.  CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrates.  He
was given 2.5L NS, Duonebs x2, Vancomycin 1 gm IV, Metronidazole
500 mg IV, Levofloxacin 750 mg IV, and Tylenol 650 mg x1.  On
transfer, vitals were T 98.3, BP 111/76, HR 113, RR 27, and SpO2
100% on BIPAP.

Initially in the ICU, the patient refused to answer any
questions and asked the ICU team to leave the room.  He did
allow a brief lung exam after some discussion.

Subsequent to his course in the ICU, the patient was
transitioned to the medical inpatient floor, for continued
management of his pneumonia, hyponatremia, and [**Hospital 29218**] infections.

.
EKG [**8-13**]-Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific lateral T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-6-4**] the heart rate is
increased. Atrial premature beats are not seen on the current
tracing.
.
CXR [**8-13**]-IMPRESSION: Left mid to lower lung consolidation,
worrisome for pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up to resolution.
.
CXR [**8-14**]- IMPRESSION: Progressive infrahilar left greater than
right opacification could relate to either aspiration and/or
infection, with superimposed component of atelectasis.
.
[**8-15**] CXR-FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
extent of the right and left basal and perihilar parenchymal
opacities, likely to reflect pneumonia, are unchanged. A mild
left pleural effusion might have newly occurred.  Otherwise, the
