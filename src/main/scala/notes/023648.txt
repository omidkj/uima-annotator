HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old man
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with a past medical history
pertinent for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and asthma
as well as diabetes recently diagnosed at [**Hospital3 **].
Patient had been splitting wood on [**2151-12-5**] when he
developed jaw pain.  Patient went to bed, but he had poor
sleep.  He took two sublingual nitroglycerins early, about 2

her doctor, informed her doctor about these symptoms, and the
doctor informed the wife to tell the husband to get to the
nearest emergency room.

Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED.  EKG there was
notable for flipped Ts in 2, 3, and aVF.  Patient was given
beta blockers and low molecular weight Heparin. The chest
pain continued.  Patient later developed AV block.  .........
pads were placed on the patient, and patient was Med Flighted
to our institution.  Upon arrival patient had already been
status post cardiac catheterization and was chest free.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Asthma.
5.  Former trauma to his left arm and leg.
6.  Diabetes diagnosed at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2151-11-29**].

ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 3.75 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Vioxx.
3.  Atenolol.
4.  Norvasc.
5.  [**Doctor First Name **].
6.  Sublingual nitroglycerin.

On transfer his medications were as follows:
1.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Lovenox 16 mg subq b.i.d.
5.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg daily.
6.  Nitroglycerin drip at 53 mcg per hour.
7.  Aggrastat drip at 12 cc per hour.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is married and is a 1.5-pack-per-day
smoker and admits to drinking three drinks per day.  Has been
a smoker since age 17.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation 97.6 is his
temperature, blood pressure is 105/66, heart rate 58,
respirations 15, satting 98% on 4 liter nasal cannula.  His
PA pressures are 37/18 with a mean PA pressure of 27.
Cardiac output is 4.8, cardiac index 2.24.  Patient is a well
developed, well nourished man in no apparent distress.  He is
alert and oriented times three.  Mucous membranes are moist.
Speech is fluent.  Patient has a right IGM placed.  There are
no carotid bruits on auscultation.  Lungs are bilaterally
clear on exam.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for normal S1,
S2; no S3, S4.  Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.  Patient's
right inguinal catheterization site is intact and no
hemorrhage, no obvious hematoma.  Extremities notable for 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  They are warm, well
perfused, no evidence of any clubbing.

LABORATORY DATA FROM [**Hospital3 **]:  Peak CPK was 1282,
peak MB was 120, peak MB index was 9.4%, and peak troponin R
was 34.86%.  Other lab studies were notable for white blood
cell count of 12.2, hematocrit is 46.8, and platelets of 201.

Patient also had an echo on [**2151-12-7**] which showed inferior
posterior hypokinesis with EF of 40%, mild MR, moderate TR,
trace AI, and borderline pulmonary hypertension.  ECG was
notable initially for sinus rate of 60 beats per minute,
normal axis.  There are some flipped Ts in leads 2, 3, and
aVF as well as [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in leads V3, V4, and V5.
Of note, however, with time the patient's EKG evolved.  By
the evening of [**2151-12-7**] patient had noted AV dissociation,
and third degree heart block at that time.

Patient was given a temporary pacer in the Cardiac
Catheterization Lab.  Cardiac anatomy was notable for totally
occluded RCA, which was stented, and 80% distal lesion in the
LAD was not initially stented.  Patient was given aspirin,
Plavix, Captopril 6.25 p.o. t.i.d., as well as on an
Aggrastat drip for 18 hours and Metoprolol 12.5 p.o. b.i.d.
Bedside echocardiogram showed initial ejection fraction of
35%.  The ............ was placed across the distal RCA
lesion.  Patient was noted to be in cardiogenic shock with
cardiac output of 2.55 and a cardiac index of 1.17.  His mean
wedge pressure was 30, ratio mean pressure is 25, and mean PA
pressure is 34.  Patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix
and responded with good urinary output to the 20 of
intravenous Lasix given.  Patient remained chest pain free
and no shortness of breath overnight and was subsequently
transferred to the floor for further observation.
observation.

Patient had a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram which
showed an ejection fraction of 45%.  There was some left
atrial elongation, mildly dilated left atrium, some mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  In terms of wall
motion, patient had akinetic basilar inferior septal wall,
akinetic basilar inferior wall, akinetic ............ wall,
akinetic basilar effusion lateral wall and akinetic mid
inferior lateral wall.  Right ventricle also had some
depression of systolic function.  There was some 1+ MR, 2+ TR
noted, no pericardial effusion.

On the floor the patient remained in flutter with occasional
PVCs and remained chest pain free.  The patient was
transitioned after being transferred to the floor from
Captopril to Zestril for discharge.  Patient was discharged
also with planned Electrophysiology outpatient follow up for
his atrial flutter.  He will follow up with his doctor and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54328**] in one month as well as follow with the [**Hospital **] Clinic
and will have his INR checked as an outpatient as well as
LFTs and was discharged home on the following medications:
Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  ............ 5 mg p.o. q. day times three days and then
INR check as outpatient.
2.  Aspirin 325 p.o. q. day.
3.  Plavix 75 p.o. q. day.
4.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. h.s.
