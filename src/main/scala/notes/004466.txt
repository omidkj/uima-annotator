History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 83415**] is a 56 year old male
with PMH notable for metastatic cancer (unknown primary)
undergoing chemo now presenting with lighheadedness and
hemoptysis. Pt is undergoing chemo with gemcitabine ([**2100-5-24**],
[**2100-5-31**]) for malignant neoplasm of unknown primary with multiple
bone, muscle, and soft-tissue metastases. He came to the
hospital to start RT to L femur today.  Pt reports a couple days
of lightheadedness, nonpositional.  Pt reports one episode of
hemoptysis [**2100-6-3**] but none since then. No sig lung lesions on
chest CT [**2100-5-27**]. Was scheduled to have transfusion on the day
of admission. Orthostatics at Dr.[**Name (NI) 83416**] office were Lying BP
94/52, pulse regular at 64. Standing BP 90/52; pulse 66.  In the
ED, initial VS were: T98, P50, RR16, BP87/43, O2 100% RA. (Per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (rad/onc) pt generally has SBP 90s-100s). He received
5.5L NS (put out 2.5L urine). He was started on Vanc infustion
but developed red itchy arm and it was stopped. He was given
benadryl with good effect. Pt did receive Cefepime 2g IV. Labs
notable for a white count of 2.2, Hct 22.9 (Hct 25 on [**5-31**]).
Chemistries were unremarkable. CXR was clear. CTA showed no PE,
stable ground glass opacities and lytic lesions. LENIs negative
for DVT. On transfer, pt's VS were T 97.6, P62, R16, BP98/59, O2
99% on RA.  On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. T98.1, HR68,
BP101/61, P70, 98%RA.  Pt denies fever, chills, night sweats,
cough, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria. Endorses constipation
with last BM two days ago. Denies bloody stool or melena. BP was
in the 80's systolic. He received 5L of fluid since admission.
2.5L urine output in the ED. One unit PRBCS was given for
chronic anemia.  HCT 20.6 on admission, bumped to 24 with the
unit of blood. CTA ruled out PE. No lung mets but there are
ground glass opacities but similar to prior study 2 wks ago for
staging purposes.  Blood cultures were sent.  No fevers.
Baseline leukopenia. bactrim and keflex for LLE cellulitis, was
being treated prior to admission.

#RADIOLOGY/STUDIES:
[][**6-7**] LENIs - no evidence DVT

[][**6-7**] CT chest/abdomen 1. No pulmonary embolism or acute
intra-abdominal process. 2. Numerous bilateral bronchovascular
ground-glass opacities, right greater than left, similar to or
minimally increased from [**2100-5-27**]. Smooth interlobular
septal thickening and slight bronchial wall thickening. This
combination of findings is potentially due to bronchopneumonia
with a component of pulmonary congestion. However, organizing
pneumonia or small foci of hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
3. Numerous lytic osseous lesions, similar to prior, involving
lower lumbar vertebra and pelvic bones. Other known osseous
lesions are not imaged. 4. Eccentric soft and calcified
abdominal aortic plaques.

[][**6-7**] CXR: no intrathoracic process


Brief Hospital Course:
[]BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY:
56 year old male with PMH notable for metastatic cancer (unknown
primary) undergoing chemo, being treated for LE cullitis,
presenting with lighheadedness [**12-17**] hypotension, s/p ICU
transfer.  At the time of discharge, patient is afebrile,
normotensive and not orthostatic.

[]ISSUES:
# Hypotension: Pt presented to the ED with lightheadedness and
was found to have systolic blood pressures in the 80s. The
patient was fluid resuscited with good effect. Initially it was
unclear if his presentation was infectious in etiology. Blood
cultures from [**6-3**] at [**Location (un) **] were NGTD. CT chest unchanged from
baseline. Although afebrile, pt may not have been able to mount
a white count and therefore might have remained afebrile despite
infection. Pt was at baseline blood pressure after fluids in ED.
Likely not obstructive shock as pt with negative CTA and
negative LENIs. Cardiogenic shock also unlikely given normal
baseli
