Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Suicidal Ideation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69F with a history of end stage HOCM with fluid
sensitivity, COPD (baseline 02 4L), chronic depression/anxiety,
schizoaffective disorder who was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] yesterday in
clinic and was noted to make statements suggestive of suicidal
ideation. She was referred from the ED for safety evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 96.8, HR 59, BP 119/82, RR 18, O2
sat 97% 4L. She was seen by psychiatry who performed an
evaluation and felt she was safe for discharge back to [**Hospital1 1501**].
Apparently got 2 mg IV ativan, then 1 mg IV ativan for anxiety
(no nursing documentation of meds given on dash or in chart, but
these pulled from pharmacy). Labs sent from ED were notable for
Na 147, WBC 7.0, Hct of 25.4 (baseline low 30s) so she was
started on 1L IVF; after about ~170cc, she became acutely SOB.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema, and she was admitted to
medicine for further management. Vitals on admission HR: 98.1.
HR: 77. RR: 25-36. O2: 94% 4Lnc. BP: 123/94.
.
Overnight, she reported feeling slightly SOB. She stated that
she felt her SOB was from panic and endorsed a panic attack in
the ED. She denied chest pain, cough, other pain or active
complaints. Overnight she triggered for AMS, possibly [**2-24**] ativan
administration in the ED. However, she remained vitally stable
and returned to baseline MS.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes
(wears glasses at baseline and left them at [**Hospital1 1501**]), does have mild
congestion (this is chronic), sore throat, cough, shortness of
breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
She has tremors in her hands and mouth occasionally at baseline.
Has occasional fecal incontinence.
.

Social History:

CXR: Mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.

Pertinent Results:
Echo pre-ablation:
The left atrium is elongated. There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction that
increases with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect).The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Left ventricular hypertrophy with valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] and
resting LVOT gradient. Eccentric jet of at least moderate mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-11-5**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.

Echo Immediately post-ablation:
Imaging performed immediately prior to, during and following
ethanol septal abaltion.

There was a severe resting left ventricular outflow gradient at
baseline (peak gradient of 123 mm Hg) and marked systolic
anterior motion of the mitral leaflets ([**Male First Name (un) **]).

Optison injections in the selected septal perforators
demonstrated enhancement in the proximal septum. Sequential
ethanol injections resulted in enhancement in the same region.

Following completion of the procedure, there was reduction in
[**Male First Name (un) **] and the peak left ventricular outflow gradient was 36 mmHg.

A lead is seen in the right ventricle.

Echo [**2174-3-5**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
is a moderate (36mmHg peak) resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve
leaflets. Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal regional and normal global (not hyperdynamic)
systolic function. Resting LVOT gradient. Pulmonary artery
hypertension. Mild aortic regurgitation. Dilated ascending
aorta. Increased PCWP.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-2-28**],
left ventricular systolic function is less dynamic, the severity
of aortic regurgitation is slightly increased, and moderate PA
systolic hypertension is now identified. The resting LVOT
gradient is lower.

Echo [**2174-3-7**]
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is small. There is a severe resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is systolic ant
