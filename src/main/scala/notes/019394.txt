NOTE:  This is a Discharge Summary for an admission ending in
death for Ms. [**Known firstname 9300**] [**Known lastname **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This was a 40-year-old Haitian
from [**Hospital 9301**] Hospital after a recent stay in the [**Hospital1 346**] [**Hospital Ward Name **] Intensive Care Unit on
[**9-27**] to [**11-18**].

She initially presented with complaints of headache,
anorexia, shortness of breath, and fevers.  She was found to
have adult respiratory distress syndrome requiring paralytics
persistent hypotension requiring pressors on several
occasions; reportedly responsive to steroids.  She was
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and
antifungals and developed acute renal failure secondary to
amphotericin.  She required an insulin drip for glucose
control.  She was eventually weaned mostly from ventilator
but did require a tracheostomy.

Her persistent fevers led to a repeat bronchoscopy which grew
herpes simplex virus.  She had episodes of pulmonary edema
but related to volume resuscitation and tachycardia.  An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy tube was placed for nutrition.
She was transferred to [**Last Name (un) 9301**] on [**11-18**].  On that day,
the patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was noted to be
hypotensive.  Intravenous phenylephrine was started at
[**Last Name (un) 9301**] but apparently turned off for the ambulance ride.

On transfer, ambulance personnel noted difficulty bagging the
patient and stopped in the Emergency Department.  There, she
was found to be hypoxic with a bradycardic arrest which
responded to epinephrine, atropine, and cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.  She arrived in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care
Unit unresponsive.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 2.  Cerebral toxoplasmosis.
 3.  Seizure disorder since [**2171**].
 4.  History of tuberculosis; status post isoniazid.

to pneumococcal sepsis.

 8.  Herpes simplex virus infection found on bronchoscopy on
[**11-10**].
 9.  History of candidal esophagitis.
10.  Premature ovarian failure.
11.  Hypoparathyroidism.
12.  Hypotension.
13.  Question Addison's disease.
14.  Empty sellar syndrome.
15.  Hypothyroidism.

intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Temperature was 101.1
axillary, heart rate was 115, blood pressure was 134/93 in
intravenous phenylephrine drip, respiratory rate was 24 on
pressor support ventilation 15 cm of water plus continuous
positive airway pressure of 5 cm of water, FIO2 of 1; oxygen
saturation was 100% on these settings, intravenous pressure
was 12.  An overweight black female with tracheostomy.  The
neck was supple without jugular venous distention or
lymphadenopathy.  The lungs with coarse breath sounds
bilaterally.  Heart was tachycardic with a regular rhythm and
normal heart sounds.  Abdomen with a few bowel sounds, softly
distended, tympanitic, jejunostomy tube in place with no
apparent tenderness.  Guaiac-negative green stool in rectal
bag.  Extremities with 2+ distal pulses.  No edema.  The skin
appeared dry.  Mucous membranes appeared dry.
Neurologically, she was responsive to painful stimuli, moved
all extremities spontaneously with 1+ biceps, patellar, and
Achilles reflexes.  Bilateral upgoing toes.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Arterial blood
gas in the Emergency Department revealed pH was 6.4, PCO2 was
220, PO2 was 73, lactate was 12.4; improving to a pH of 7.07,
PCO2 of 100, and then to pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 46, with a
lactate of 2, and a PO2 of 87.  Sodium was 139 and potassium
was 4.1.  Hematocrit was 28.  Ionized calcium was 1.14.

Laboratory data from [**Last Name (un) 9301**] on [**11-20**] revealed white
blood cell count was 20 (with 85 polymorphonuclear cells, 9
lymphocytes, and 6 monocytes), hematocrit was 22.5, and
platelets were 150.  Sodium was 140, potassium was 4.4,

On arrival to the Intensive Care Unit white blood cell count
was 22.6, hematocrit was 26.4, and platelets were 158.
Prothrombin was 16.2, INR was 1.7, partial thromboplastin
time was 29.8.  Sodium was 139, potassium was 3.2, chloride
was 104, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 27,
creatinine was 1.8, and blood glucose was 183.  AST was 25,

phosphatase was 115, total bilirubin was 0.3.  Calcium was
7.2, magnesium was 1.5, phosphate was 7.1.  Albumin was 2.1.

Microbiology from last admission showed methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus growing from [**Month (only) **] on multiple
occasions and herpes simplex virus growing from
bronchoalveolar lavage several times.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed increased air
space disease with persistent interstitial disease, right
internal jugular catheter and right peripherally inserted
catheter in place.  Tracheostomy in good position.

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at 27, with a
long P-R interval.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's respiratory arrest was felt
to have a very broad differential.  She received supportive
care with blood, urine, and [**Month (only) **] cultures.  Broad-spectrum
antibiotics were continued and stress-dose steroids were
given for relative adrenal insufficiency.  Pyrimethamine for
toxoplasmosis history and [**Month (only) **] for her herpes simplex
virus infection were continued.

Ms. [**Known lastname 9302**] decreased neurologic status was felt to be quite
concerning for anoxic brain injury.  The Neurology Service
was consulted.   A computed tomography scan of the head was
ordered as well as electroencephalogram.  Dilantin was
reloaded for a low level.

Infectious Disease consultation recommended discontinuation
of [**Known lastname **]; which was done.  Vancomycin, ceftazidime,
metronidazole, and ampicillin were continued.

The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation easily and
responded to furosemide for diuresis.

The Neurology consultation felt the patient to be minimally
responsive; likely due to anoxic brain injury.  They agreed
with workup in progress and recommended re-evaluating
neurologic examination over several days to evaluate for
prognosis.

While ventilation was easy, the patient required
neuromuscular paralysis because she was continually biting
her tongue.  After an oral airway was placed, it was possible
to discontinue paralysis, and the patient remained
comfortable on pressor support ventilation.
