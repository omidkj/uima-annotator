pneumonia

History of Present Illness:
82 yo man with HTN, DM, CVA, afib with pacer who presented to
the ED from his nursing home with change in mental status,
hypoxia to 82% on 2 L NC and shortness of breath after a
witnessed aspiration event. In the ED, initial vitals were: T
99.8, HR 120, BP 88/48. He became hypotensive in the ED with
pressures: He received 1 L NS and his pressures came up to the
110s/70s. His PCP called the [**Name9 (PRE) **] to speak with the staff and per
the ED resident did not want central access to be implemented
unless the patient could not maintain blood pressures with IVF
through the PIV. Since his pressure came up with only 1 liter of
NS, central access was not implemented. He received 1 g vanco,
750 mg levaquin and 500 mg flagyl in the ED for NHAP vs.
aspiration pna. Head CT was done for acute ms changes and was
negative for intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarction.
.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's initial vs were T 99, BP
147/86, R 27, O2at 99% on 100% NRB. Patient has expressive
aphasia and was not responding to questions.

Blood and urine culture negative. Urine legionella antigen
negative. Stool culture negative.

[**2188-11-17**]: CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intracranial
hemorrhage or evidence of acute major vascular territorial
infarction. Large hypodense focus in the left MCA distribution
likely represents cystic encephalomalacia from prior infarct and
is associated with ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral
ventricle. Periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensity is likely the sequela of chronic small vessel
ischemia. Posterior right cerebellar hypodensity is associated
with dystrophic calcification and likely the sequelae of prior
insult. Mild mucosal thickening and small air fluid level noted
in the right maxillary sinus. The remainder of the imaged
portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. Chronic left
MCA infarct with encephalomalacia.

[**2188-11-17**] PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
likely unchanged, allowing for positioning with atherosclerotic
mural calcification of the thoracic aorta again noted. There are
bilateral parenchymal opacities projecting over the lower lungs.
The upper lungs remain clear. There is no evidence of large
effusion or pneumothorax. A large amount of air is noted within
the stomach with associated prominent air-filled bowel loops A
single lead pacemaker projects over the right hemithorax.

IMPRESSION: 1) New bilateral lower lung opacities likely
represent multifocal consolidation, including aspiration
pneumonitis.
2) Gas-distended stomach and bowel loops may benefit from
nasogastric tube decompression.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2188-11-17**]  6:47:44 PM


Atrial fibrillation. Intraventricular conduction disturbance. T
wave inversions in leads I, II and aVF. Non-specific St segment
depressions in leads V3-V4 with T wave inversions in these
leads. QS deflections in leads III and aVF compatible with
transmural inferior wall myocardial infarction - old. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2186-2-7**] atrial fibrillation with
continuous ventricular pacing at rate 60 was previously present.
Pacemaker is currently inhibited because of rapid atrial
fibrillation.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW

Reason: difficulty swallowing

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
difficulty swallowing
INDICATION: CVA with difficulty swallowing.

COMPARISON: None.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: This exam was performed in
conjunction with the speech pathologist. Under continuous
fluoroscopic guidance, various consistencies of barium were
administered orally. There was significant delay of the oral
phase and moderate delay of the pharyngeal phase with premature
spillover of all consistencies but worst with thin liquids.
There was impaired palatal elevation and premature upper
esophageal sphincter closure. Premature closure resulted in
trapping of some liquid proximal to the sphincter, worst with
thin liquids. Minimal residue was seen in the piriform sinuses.
The epiglottic deflection was adequate. There was no penetration
or aspiration with barium of any consistency.

IMPRESSION:
1. Significant delay in oral phase. Moderate delay in pharyngeal
phase.
2. Impaired palatal elevation with premature upper esophageal
sphincter closure.
3. Minimal residue in the piriform sinuses.
4. No penetration or aspiration with any consistency.

US doppler: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT involving the right
or left lower extremity.
