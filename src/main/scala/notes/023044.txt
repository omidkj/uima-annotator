History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old man w/ a hx of ESRD on HD, s/p
failed transplant, and HTN who presented with sudden onset left
wrist pain. He noted that his wrist (distal to his native vessel
fistula site) was swollen and had reduced range of motion. Pain
present at rest and with motion. Pt also noted fevers and chills
the night before, but no nausea or vomiting. He did not recall
any trauma to the area or skin lesion. He is on a M/W/F dialysis
schedule, but because of increased pain and swelling, presented
to ED instead of usual HD.

Upon arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vitals were T 100.5, HR 97, BP
173/71, RR 14, O2sat 100% on RA. New-onset afib was noted. His
left wrist was aspirated and returned frank pus, consistent with
septic arthritis. Pt started empirically on vancomycin and
gentamycin while awaiting wound and blood cultures, then taken
to the OR by plastic surgery for wash-out of pus in the joint
and placement of Penrose drain. Following PACU recovery, the
patient was transferred to the Medicine service.
