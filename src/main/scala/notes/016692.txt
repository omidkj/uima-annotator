normal in cavity size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of
the anterior septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 20118**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after her cardiac cath
revealed severe coronary artery disease. She was appropriately
worked up for bypass surgery. On [**3-26**] she was brought to the
operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 2. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition.She awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated without difficulty. She was weaned off
pressors. Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis were
initiated. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely
fashion, without complications. She continued to progress and on
POD#.... she was transferred to the step down unit for further
monitoring. Physical therapy was consulted for strength and
mobility evaluation. The remainder of her postoperative course
was essentially uneventful. POD#4 scant serous drainage from the
inferior pole of the sternal wound was noted. Betadine swabs/dry
sterile dressing changes were instituted, along with
antibiotics. Her discharge was preempted to reevaluate the
wound. Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] cleared her for discharge to home on oral
antibiotics x 1 week, with wound follow up in 1 week. On POD#7
she was cleared for discharge to home. All follow up
appointments were advised.
