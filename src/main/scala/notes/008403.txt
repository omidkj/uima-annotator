HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This woman came in by ambulance
for confusion, shortness of breath and weakness.  This is a
47-year-old female, with severe COPD and asthma, recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] from [**Date range (1) 108259**] for treatment of
bilateral pneumonia and respiratory failure, necessitating
intubation.  The patient was discharged on [**3-6**] with
instructions to complete a 12-day course of Levofloxacin and
a prednisone [**Month/Year (2) 15123**].

The morning of admission, the patient awoke dyspneic and
confused.  She was with her neighbor who called 911.  When
EMS arrived, her systolic blood pressure was 60.  On
presentation to the ED, SBP was in the 70s.  The patient
febrile to 101.5 and tachycardic to the 120s.  The patient
was noted to be dyspneic with poor air movement.  The patient
was given 100 mg of Solu-Medrol IV, 500 mg of  Levofloxacin,
and 100 mg of gentamicin.  First ABG 7.26, 82, 109 with O2
sats of 99% on 100% face mask.  The patient was placed on
BiPAP.  Subsequent ABG was 7.36, 59, 167.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Asthma.
2. COPD with central lobe lobular emphysema.
3. Bilateral pulmonary nodules.
4. Hypertension.
5. Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
6. Partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (secondary to
lithium).
7. Bipolar disorder.
8. Migraine headaches.
9. CHF.  Echo [**2-28**] showed EF of 30-35%, moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis, 1+ MR.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and ampicillin lead to rash.  Motrin
leads to rash.  Bactrim leads to unknown reaction.  Lithium
leads to renal toxicity and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

[**Hospital 12145**] HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU
from the Emergency Room for hypercarbic respiratory failure,
where she was quickly intubated on arrival to the floor due
to persistent hypercarbia and acidemia that did not improve
on BIPAP and continued to get worse.  The patient was
originally treated with Levofloxacin for pneumonia, steroids,
initially IV, for COPD flare/asthma flare, and treated with
nebs.  The patient was also given fluid boluses for
hypernatremia and hypotension.  All of her other outpatient
medications were continued with the exception of former
treatment with glipizide in the ICU setting.

The patient continued to have hypercarbic respiratory failure
and was unable to be weaned off of the vent.  On [**2197-3-20**],
the patient was transferred from the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] MICU to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 516**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  She continued to be intubated on steroids
and nebulizer treatments.  At that point, her respiratory
failure was deemed secondary to pneumonia, and more
prominently COPD flare, and least prominent her chronic
asthma.  The patient was repeatedly tried on pressure
support, but did not tolerate, became apneic, and was
maintained on A/C ventilation with frequent suctioning of
white sputum.

On [**2197-3-22**], the patient was maintained on pressure support.
However, she continued to have difficulty with spontaneous
breathing, despite no positive sputum cultures at that point
except for presence of mold on her initial cultures.  The
patient was maintained on her 10-day course of Levofloxacin,
remained intubated, and continued to receive supportive care.

The patient was found to have large pneumothoraces on chest
x-ray.  The patient had ultrasound-guided tube thoracostomy
(12 French pigtail catheter) placed anteriorly by the
interventional pulmonology service.  Prior to this procedure,
chest CT was performed which confirmed the large
pneumothorax.  The patient remained on pressure support and
stable, but FIO2 had to be increased in the presence of this
large pneumothorax.  The patient was also found to have a
second pneumothorax, both apical and basilar pneumothoraces.
However, the pigtail catheter drained only the apical
pneumothorax.  The basilar pneumothorax was felt by CT
surgery and interventional pulmonology not to be able to
cause tension pneumo because of the current chest tube, and
further going to the OR would cause further air leaks.
Therefore, the patient was left as she was with CT evaluation
to follow-up.

In addition, the patient's sputum grew MRSA from samples on
[**3-21**] and [**3-22**].  Therefore, the patient was started on
Levofloxacin for a 14-day course of IV antibiotics.  The
patient was also treated for thrush in the setting of her
prednisone [**Month/Year (2) 15123**].

Of note, this patient experienced ventilator-related
pneumothorax in [**2196-2-27**], as well.  This patient has
bilateral bullous emphysema and is likely prone to ventilator
associated pneumothorax.  Both of these pneumothoraces have
occurred on the right side.

HOSPITAL COURSE (AFTER MICU):  The patient was transferred to
the ACOVE service on [**2197-3-31**], after having been extubated on
[**2197-3-30**] on 4 liters nasal cannula.  The patient's chest
tubes were DC'd on [**2197-3-31**].

1) HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, COPD EXACERBATION, MRSA
PNEUMONIA COMPLICATED BY ASTHMA, AND POTENTIAL MEDICAL
NONCOMPLIANCE:  The patient was stable status post extubation
on 4 liters nasal cannula initially, and weaned down to 2
liters nasal cannula (her baseline O2 requirement at home).
The goal was to maintain the patient on 92% O2 sat on
supplemental oxygen.  She generally satted greater than 95%
on 2 liters NC.

2) ASTHMA:  Likely part of the initial presentation, but
improved with minimal anterior wheezing throughout the course
of her floor stay.  The patient continued on the steroid
[**Last Name (LF) 15123**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-acting beta agonists, prn MDIs, added inhaled
steroid, and prn nebs.

3) COPD EXACERBATION:  The patient was treated initially with
Levofloxacin and steroid [**First Name3 (LF) 15123**], as indicated above.  The
patient was maintained on long-acting MDIs and inhaled
steroid, both of which should improve her chronic COPD
secondary to long-term sm
