[**2182-10-29**] MRSA screen: positive
.
CT abd/pelvis [**2182-10-29**]:
1.  Interval colectomy and colostomy takedown with a large
amount of
intraperitoneal free air and fecalized material throughout the
abdomen,
especially within the left paracolic gutter and pelvis, most
consistent with anastomostic dehiscence.
2.  Gas dissecting into the soft tissues of the pelvic side
walls and
extending into the left groin and anterior abdominal wall which
may be related to extension of intraperitoneal gas; however,
necrotizing fasciitis cannot be excluded.
3.  Distended gallbladder containing layering high-density
material, which may be related to milk of calcium.
4.  Opacity within the left lower lung which may represent
atelectasis versus airspace consolidation.
.
[**2182-11-2**] C.diff: positive
.
CT abd/pelvis [**2182-11-11**]:
1.  Interval development of three dominant discrete abdominal
fluid
collections, which are suspicious for abscesses.
2.  Interval increase in bilateral lower lobe consolidation,
which is
suspicious for pneumonia, given relative [**Name (NI) 20534**].
3.  Interval resolution of the left groin and pelvic sidewall
air.
.
CT-guided procedure [**2182-11-12**]:
Patient status post CT-guided catheter placement into right and
left-sided
fluid collections, the right suggestive of hematoma and the left
compatible with abscess , without immediate complication.
.
[**2182-11-13**] L IR drain: >3 colony types, rare Pseudomonas
[**2182-11-13**] R IR drain: rare Pseudomonas (R to cipro, otherwise
pan-sensitive)
.
CT abd/pelvis [**2182-11-17**]:
1.  Polypoid filling defect within the distal rectum, most
likely representing sequlae of recent reanastomosis (possible
blood clot), as it was not seen on the prior scan. There is no
definite evidence of a leak although the rectal contrast does
not flow proximal to the anastomosis inspite of rectal
distention with contrast and repeat/delayed scanning.
2.  Interval decreased size of the abdominal collections are
described above.
3.  Interval improvement in the consolidations at the lung
bases.
4.  Increased stranding in the mesentry of the abdomen and
pelvis.
5.  Enlarged uterus which may represent uterine fibroids and can
be assessed further with a pelvic ultrasound as per clinical
need.
.
CTA chest [**2182-11-19**]:
1.  Very small right middle lobar pulmonary embolus unlikely
large enough to account for the patient's clinical symptoms.
2.  Dilated fluid-filled esophagus and stomach with patulous GE
junction, and retrograde flow of contrast to the lung apices,
placing the patient at risk for aspiration.  Removal of gastric
contents would be advised.
3.  Extensive new portal venous gas.  Correlation with recent
lactate, and abdominal exam.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**2182-11-19**]:
1.  No free air or pneumatosis.
2.  Stranding of the mesentery in abdomen and pelvis is
unchanged since
[**2182-11-17**].
3.  Marked decrease in amount of portal venous air since [**86**]
hours ago.
4.  Interval decrease in size of abdominal collections as
described above.
.
[**2182-11-19**] MRSA screen: positive
[**2182-11-19**] urine culture: E.coli (S to gentamicin, imipenem,
meropenem, nitrofurantoin, Zosyn, Bactrim)
[**2182-11-19**] drain culture: >3 colony types, heavy Pseudomonas (R to
cipro, otherwise pan-sensitive)
.
LENI [**2182-11-20**]:
No evidence of DVT involving the right or left lower
extremities.
.
[**2182-11-20**] C.diff: positive
.
Pelvic US [**2182-11-28**]:
Markedly limited examination due to the patient's clinical
status and mobility as described above.  While no frank uterine
abnormalities were identified, the examination was not
sufficient to evaluate the endometrium for the presence or
absence of malignancy.
.
LUE US [**2182-11-29**]:
Deep venous thrombosis involving the left basilic, brachial, and
axillary veins.  The subclavian vein is inadequately evaluated
and therefore the proximal extent of the thrombus is not
determined.
.
[**2182-12-5**] C.diff: negative
.
LUE US [**2182-12-9**]:
Recanalization of the brachial and axillary veins with chronic
basilic vein occlusion.
.
R wrist XR [**2183-12-15**]:
Osteopenia.  No fracture detected.  Probable faint
chondrocalcinosis, which can be seen with CPPD arthritis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was started on vanc/levo/Flagyl and taken to the OR for
urgent exploratory laparotomy on [**10-29**].  Findings included
leakage between two sutures of the anterior wall of the
anastamosis, a well-developed abscess cavity in the L pelvis,
and fecal peritonitis.  She underwent repair of the anastamosis,
irrigation of the peritoneal cavity, placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain
into the L pelvis, and a proximal transverse loop colostomy.
Please see the operative note for further details.
.
She was admitted to the TSICU postoperatively on sepsis
protocol.  She remained sedated & intubated, requiring HD
support.  She was started on TPN on [**10-30**].  She was weaned off
pressors fo
