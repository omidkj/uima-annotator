Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
Flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2203-2-18**] - Left nephrostomy tube replacement
[**2203-2-18**] - Mechanical ventilation during nephrostomy replacement
[**2203-2-18**] - Central venous line placement in right internal
jugular vein


History of Present Illness:
79yo male w/ dCHF, COPD, OSA on CPAP and  metastatic, castrate
resistant prostate cancer who comes in with left-flank pain and
fevers. Two days ago he was feeling well. Yesterday he developed
fevers and left flank pain. Overnight he had nausea with a small
amount of non-bloody emesis. No diarrhea, he has actually been
constipated. He came into the ED. Of note, he had a nephrostomy
tube placed [**2-9**] by interventional radiology because of
hydronephrosis on CT scan.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 102.0 109 145/71 24 96%. Triggered
for tachycardia. Given 3L IV fluids. A CT scan his nephrostomy
tube was out of place, with resultant hydronephrosis and
surrounding fat-stranding concerning for pyelonephritis. He was
given vanc/zosyn. A right IJ was placed. Is making urine, with
negative UA. No foley in place. 110, 132/64, 30, 97% on RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient alert, oriented, but tachypneic.
He confirmed that he had been feeling unwell since yesterday,
with left flank pain that is much worse with movement, but no
pain elsewhere. He was unable to lie flat. He was intubated for
nephrostomy replacement. He was unable to provide further ROS.

Imaging:

-CT Abd/Pelvis ([**2203-2-18**]):
IMPRESSION:
Misplaced left percutaneous nephrostomy catheter with the
pigtail coiled in the lateral perinephric fat.
2. Moderate-to-severe left hydroureteronephrosis with extensive
perinephric fat stranding and pararenal fascial thickening. This
could represent pyelonephritis in a closed urinary collecting
system, or post-surgical changes from the recent procedure and
displacement of the catheter.
3. Stable thickening of the soft tissues adjacent to the
prostate, likely representing prostate cancer, with unchanged
paraaortic mass causing left reteric malignant obstruction.
4. Sclerotic appearance of right posterior 10th rib and adjacent
pedicle of the T10 vertebra, with increased uptake seen on bone
scan in [**2201**], which may represent an old traumatic injury,
however, is also concerning for metastatic disease given the
patient's history of metastatic prostate cancer. Routine
followup with bone scan is recommended.

-AP CXR ([**2203-2-18**]): enlarged heart. Bibasilar opacities, likely
atelectasis. Worsening congestion.

-KUB ([**2203-2-19**]): There is some overlying artifact and motion on
the study. A percutaneous nephrostomy tube appears to be
projecting over the left mid abdomen. No nasogastric tube or
Foley catheter is visualized. Calcification in the right
hemipelvis is felt to most likely represent a phlebolith.
Degenerative changes are seen in the spine. No acute bony
abnormality. There is scattered air in nondistended loops of
colon.

-KUB ([**2203-2-22**]): Unchanged left nephrostomy tube position.


Brief Hospital Course:
79yo male with dCHF, COPD, OSA on home CPAP and metastatic
prostate cancer causing left-sided hydronephrosis who presents
with displacement of his nephrostomy tube and pyelonephritis
with sepsis.
