PATHOLOGY:
[**2112-10-15**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: right colon, retro-peritoneal
tissue, section transverse colon, omemtum.

DIAGNOSIS:

I.  Right ileocolectomy specimen (A-Q): Subacute/interval
appendicitis with severe periappendicitis, periappendiceal/cecal
abscess formation, and fecal material consistent with
perforation. Adenoma, 2.5 cm. Multiple hyperplastic polyps. One
focus of distorted but crowded glands with cytologic and
architectural atypia and focal intraluminal necrotic debris
identified at the distal colonic resection margin consistent
with dysplasia/adenoma, cannot exclude high grade. Unremarkable
segment of ileum and proximal resection margin. Eleven
unremarkable lymph nodes.
II.  Retroperitoneal tissue (R): Fibroadipose tissue with acute
and chronic inflammation, necrosis, and granulation tissue and
abscess formation.
III.  Omentum (S): Unremarkable adipose tissue.
IV.  Transverse colon resection (T-V): Hyperplastic polyp.
Unremarkable mucosa. Three unremarkable lymph nodes.
.
[**2112-10-20**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: right thigh tissue.

DIAGNOSIS:

Soft tissue, right thigh, excision: Fibroadipose tissue with
acute and chronic inflammation, fat necrosis, and granulation
tissue. See note.

Note:

Although no organisms were identified on special stain (GMS,
PAS-D, Gram), the findings, along with the clinical history,
favor a diagnosis of panniculitis, most likely due to infectious
etiologies.   Alternatively and less likely, this process could
be a secondary inflammatory response (e.g. "id reaction") to a
primary trigger such as an abscess at a distant site. Clinical
correlation recommended.
.
IMAGING:
[**2112-10-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is
considerable beat-tobeat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-22**]+) mitral regu
