Pertinent Results:
TTE (Complete) Done [**2157-1-12**] at 9:32:13 AM      FINAL
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricle has moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Carotid U/S - [**2157-1-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
2. Occluded left ICA.

Cardiac Cath - [**2157-1-20**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate left main and diffuse three vessel coronary artery
disease.
2. Moderate to severe aortic stenosis.
3. Low cardiac output/index.
4. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
5. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 33733**] is a 66 year old male with known severe PVD, DM,
severe AS, CHF, who was admitted with LLE gangrene.  He
underwent a right below the knee amputation. During this
admission the patient developed acute CHF and ARF.  He was found
to have severe AS and multivessel CAD and on [**2157-1-24**] he underwent
an aortic valve replacement (#23mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical) and
coronary artery bypass grafting times three
(Lima->LAD/SVG->OM1-OM2sequential). Please refer to Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 95333**] operative report for further details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in critical but
stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  He awoke
neurologically intact, pressors were weaned and he was extubated
on post-operative day one. Mr.[**Known lastname 33733**] was placed on stress dose
steroids for his polymyalgia rheumatica and was seen in
consultation by [**Last Name (un) **] for elevated blood sugars.  He required
aggressive diuresis with a lasix drip.  Electrophysiology
interrogated his internal pacemaker and his epicardial wires
were removed. Coumadin and heparin were started for the
mechanical aortic valve and atrial fibrillation. On POD#4
Mr.[**Known lastname 33733**] was transferred to the surgical step down floor. The
lasix drip was weaned to off. [**1-30**] Mr.[**Known lastname 33733**] complained of poor
visual focus in the mornings. An Ophthalmology consult was done
and he was found to have a normal exam.  Neurology was also
consulted and felt it was likely due to fluctuating blood
sugars. [**2-1**] a Head CTA was done which confirmed a previous
ischemic event. No new changes.Neurology cleared Mr.[**Known lastname 33733**] for
discharge to rehab. He also experienced diarrhea toward the end
of his stay and tested positive for clostridium difficile.  He
was placed on flagyl.  The  steroid taper was completed and he
was placed on his home maintenance dose of hydrocortisone. By
post operative day #8, [**2-1**] he was ready for transfer to a rehab
facility for increase in strength, endurance and daily
activities.All follow up appointments were advised.
