History of Present Illness:
49M w/hx of HIV, CD4=1294 [**2156-2-19**] on ARVs. Patient has a past
medical history significant for cardiomyopathy status post VSD
repair, amoebic abscess. Found at home down on the ground and
bathroom for an unknown period of time. Per family baseline
mental status is crystal clear, alert and oriented. Patient has
had gradual decline in mental status, history of recent falls.
Patient says that he has had decreased p.o. intake for
nonspecific reasons. He is generally without somatic complaints,
no headache or vision change, no neck pain, chest pain or
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, no rashes, no change in
medications. The only thing I can elicit from the patient is
that he is reporting insomnia, for which he has intermittently
taken Benadryl for the past week.

In the ED, initial VS were: HR 64  BP 79/55  RR 14  SpO2 92%
Patient received vanco, unasyn, bactrim, for presumed pneumonia
2L NS given for BP support. Blood cultures sent. Patient had
CXR, CT head negative for acute process. CVL was attempted,
patient given 1mg lorazepam before hand. Right subclavian
obtained first pass, wire threaded to 3 dots, and patient had
instances of ectopy. Wire was withdrawn back to 2 dots, then
back to 1 dot, and ectopy increased 5 beats, then run of
pulseless v tach. CPR was initiated, patient recieved 1mg
epinephrine, 150mg amiodarone, shocked w/ 200J back to sinus
rhythm with bigeminy. Downtime <1min. Groggy afterwards, but
remaines alert and oriented. Now w/ R femoral in place.

ABG; pH 7.33, pCO2 59, pO2 43, HCO3 33
AST: 182 ALT: 85
Lactate: 2.5
BUN 66, creat 2.2
CK: 5026 Trop-T: 0.03

Transfer VS: HR 53 BP 91/47 RR 15 O2 94%

On arrival to the MICU, patient states he does not remember
exactly the events that brought him into the ED, although he
does remember falling today. Does not recall events of the code.
Currently his only complaint is of feeling tired. Denies CP,
SOB, cough, sputum production, palpitations, abdominal pain, or
any musculoskeletal pain.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
