History of Present Illness:
In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 83-year-old female with multiple
medical problems including ESRD on HD (MWF), DM2, PVD, Afib,
severe AS s/p mAVR (St. [**Known lastname 923**]'s valve), recurrent GIB [**2-10**]
diverticulosis s/p colectomy and [**Doctor Last Name **] procedure in [**2162**] with
continued GIBs, recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] after bleeding from
ostomy, now transfered from [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital after presenting
from rehab with approx ~1L of frank blood from ileostomy. Pt
noticed blood in ileostomy bag morning of presentation and
dropped SBPs into 80s (baseline 110-130s). Pt denies ever having
any abdominal pain, no pain around ileostomy site. Denies any
increased ileostomy output. Denies lightheadedness, weakness,
abd pain, CP, nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills.
.
Of note, most recent prior admission, pt was bleeding from
ostomy and found to have supratherapeutic INR of 6.6. After this
admission, INR goal changed to 2.5-3.0.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.1 84 102/52 16 100%RA. Received
3.5L NS and started receiving 1st unit PRBC. In the ED, SBPs
responded to fluids. Labs: INR 4.1, hematocrit 26.8 (similar to
baseline), plt 159. Cr 5.3 (ESRD on HD MWF, was 5.6 on [**9-13**]). GI
and colorectal surgery were consulted in the ED. VS on transfer
were 78, 115/73, 20, 98%RA.
.
During her ICU stay, pt was given 2U FFP and received 5U PRBC
total. EGD that showed gastritis, and colonoscopy that showed
diverticulosis in transverse and ascending colon, without a
specific source identified. However, likely bleed [**2-10**]
diverticuli as per GI. She was initially on protonix drip and
was later switched to daily PPIs.
.
The patient was also found to be hypocalcemic and given calcium
gluconate. Day 2 MICU patient spiked temp 101-102 and she became
hypotensive and associated AMS with hypotension, BPs minimally
responsive to 2.5 L IVF. She was started on Levo for <24hours,
she has poor peripheral access, unable to get CVL so Levo
administered through tunneled cath. Zosyn/Vanc started for
possible line infection, cultures negative and she remained
hemodynamically stable off pressors so ABx stopped, she was
given ABx for 3 days. Fever likely associated with transfusions.
AMS Required pressors <24hours. Unclear infection source,
patient Cdiff negative, blood cx still pending.
.
Upon transfer to the medicine floor, VSS with no acute bleeding.

Patient is an 83-year-old female with multiple medical problems
including ESRD on HD (MWF), DM2, PVD, Afib, severe AS s/p mAVR
(St. [**Month/Day (2) 923**]'s valve), recurrent GIB treated with colectomy and
[**Doctor Last Name **] procedure in [**2162**] with continued GIBs after the
procedures who was transferred from [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital where she
presented from rehab with approx ~1L of frank blood from
ileostomy. Patient's pressures at rehab had been SBP 110-130s
until this morning when she first noted bleeding from ostomy;
changed the bag once at 11 am. SBP reportedly dropped to 80s.
Blood has since pooled while she was in the ED. Denies
lightheadedness, weakness, abd pain, CP, nausea, vomiting,
fevers or chills.
