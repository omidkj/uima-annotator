Admission Date:  [**2166-12-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2167-1-2**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
83-year-old female with COPD, atrial fibrillation, CHF, and
aortic stenosis who has had progressive worsening of her
shortness of breath.  Previous evaluation by echocardiogram
at an outside hospital revealed worsening of her aortic valve
stenosis and mitral regurgitation.  The patient was referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for possible aortic valve replacement.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 53680**]ate of admission, a TEE was performed which showed an
aortic valve area of 0.8 as well as no evidence of mitral valve
regurgitation.  Given these findings, Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], the
cardiothoracic surgeon, felt that further investigation of her
dypnea was preferable since the aortic stenosis may not have
been the primary culprit in her symptoms. A valvuloplasty was
considered as a diagnostic tool and the surgery was postponed.
The patient was transferred to the CCU Service for medical
management and work-up.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Hospital3 **].  Her
two daughters are very involved in her care. She denied a
history of smoking.  She denied a history of a history of
alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Her mother died from heart disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile
with a blood pressure of 118/67, heart rate 77, respiratory
rate of 20, oxygen saturation 99% on face mask following
extubation.  The physical examination is notable for labored
breathing but no accessory muscle use.  There are no crackles
or wheezes on examination.  The patient has a III/VI systolic
ejection murmur heard throughout the precordium.  There is no
lower extremity edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  AORTIC STENOSIS:  The patient was
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] approximately a month prior to
admission following cardiac catheterization.  At that time,
she was found to have an aortic valve area of 0.9 with a
cardiac index of 3.1 and a peak gradient of 31.  In the
interim since her discharge, the patient had an outpatient
echocardiogram at an outside hospital.  At that time, it was
felt that her aortic valve area had worsened to 0.6 and that
there was also evidence of mitral valve regurgitation.  The
patient was referred by her primary cardiologist for aortic
valve and mitral valve replacement.

On the date of admission, the patient was taken to the
Operating Room.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was
performed prior to the procedure.  It showed an aortic valve
area of 0.8 and no evidence of mitral valve regurgitation.

On the following day, the patient was taken to cardiac
catheterization for repeat evaulation and standby valvuloplasty.
She was found to have a cardiac output of 5.14 and a cardiac
index of 3.61.  Her aortic valve area was measured at 0.8 with an
area index of 0.53.  The aortic valve gradient was 43.14.  The
patient had normal filling pressures.  Due to these findings,
namely her relatively preserved cardiac output and normal
filling pressures, it was decided not to perform valvuloplasty on
the patient.  It was felt that her aortic stenosis was not severe
enough to explain her dyspnea in isolation.

Of note, an echocardiogram done on the day of cardiac
catheterization showed [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] initially of 0.4 cm.  Upon review,
it was noted that the MR jet was eccentric and was
overestimating the stenosis and gradient.

2.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation.  She had a pacemaker placed in [**2165-12-6**].  Multiple EKGs showed a V-paced rhythm.  She was
continued on her home dose of Amiodarone as well as aspirin.
The patient experienced no episodes of atrial fibrillation
during the hospitalization.

3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient has a history of
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 38%.
The patient was started on a low-dose of an ACE inhibitor
which she tolerated well.  Her systolic blood pressures
remained stable in the low 100s.  She was also restarted on
her home dose of Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. prior to discharge.

4.  PULMONARY:  Since it was not felt that her pulmonary
symptoms could be entirely explained by her aortic stenosis,
a pulmonary consult was obtained.  According to the patient's
primary pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36953**], the patient has a history
of a mild obstructive picture.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36953**] had performed a
thorough pulmonary workup in the past including PFTs and
chest CT.  Although unusual considering the patient has no
smoking history, the patient's picture most likely fits COPD.


During the hospitalization, pulmonary function tests were
obtained which revealed a FEV1 of 540 cc (41% predicted), an
FVC of 0.98 liters (47% predicted), and an FEV1/FVC ratio of
86% predicted.  Her lung volumes were also decreased.  Her
total lung capacity was 2.47 (65% predicted).  Her DLCO was
also decreased at 4.16 (28% predicted). The patient was found
to have no desaturations on ambulation with a good pulse ox
[**Location (un) 1131**].

A chest CT was obtained which showed mild emphysematous
changes but no evidence of interstitial disease or
bronchiectasis.  She also had a focal ground glass opacity in
the right lung apex as well as small branching opacity of the
right lower lobe consistent with a focal mucoid impactation
or focal atelectasis.  The ground glass opacity is of unknown
significance.

Pulmonary consult was asked to comment on the findings.  They
felt that the results were consistent with a moderate to
severe restrictive pattern secondary to her severe
kyphoscoliosis and possibly in part from her cardiomegaly
although the percent predicted was not that impression given
the patient's age and size.  They felt that the decrement was
likely very significant.  However, they were not able to
offer any therapy for her chest wall deformity.  The DLCO
decrement was felt to correct for lung volume and they were
reassured that the patient did not desaturate during
ambulation.  Pulmonary consult felt that possible etiologies
for the trend down as compared to previous PFTs included the
small ground glass opacity, mucous, possible history of
aspiration due to esophageal dilation, pulmonary edema, or
Amiodarone.

Pulmonary consult recommended repeating a CT to follow the
ground glass opacity seen in the right upper lobe.  They also
recommended an outpatient speech and swallow evaluation to
rule out aspiration given the patient's history of esophageal
dilation.  They recommended stopping Amiodarone, although the
patient is on Amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation.  Seeing
how her pulmonary status is likely to continue worsening, it
was felt that the patient's primary care physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], or pulmonologist should discuss code status
considering the need for oxygen or ventilation.  An attempt
will be made to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36953**] to discuss these new
findings.

5.  RIGHT FEMORAL AV FISTULA:  The day following cardiac
catheterization, the patient was found to have a right
femoral bruit on examination.  There was no evidence of
hematoma at that site.  A femoral vascular ultrasound was
performed which showed an AV fistula but no evidence of
pseudoaneurysm.  Following discussion with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
