Admission Date:  [**2114-10-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-10-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**2044-6-19**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71-year-old male with a
known history of chronic atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and a known cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction
of approximately 25% who presented to [**Hospital3 23439**] Hospital one
day prior to admission complains of light-headedness,
dizziness, and found to be in monomorphic ventricular
tachycardia.  He was converted to atrial fibrillation with a
Lidocaine drip.  He had no chest pain.  He did admit to
occasional episodes of light-headedness and dizziness over
the past two to three weeks with two episodes of syncope.  He
was admitted last week with congestive heart failure and was
dizzy during his admission with a systolic blood pressure in
the 60s that was felt to be secondary to his medications.
The night prior he then had another episode of
light-headedness and syncope.  He returned to the Emergency
Department.  He was again found to be in monomorphic VT and
he again converted to atrial fibrillation.  He was admitted
to the Cardiology service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion.
2.  Congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
5.  History of thyroid surgery in [**2109**].
6.  Colon cancer status post resection.
7.  History of Bell's palsy.
8.  Status post appendectomy.
9.  Status post tonsillectomy.

He was seen by Cardiology service at admission.  It was
suspected that his ventricular arrhythmias were due to some
active ischemia and recommended an ET consult before
catheterization for question of ET ablation or AV nodal
ablation.  His cardiologist is Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1104**].  Please refer
to his admission note.  He had a cardiac catheterization done
which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20%, 30%
left main lesion, 70% LAD lesion, 70% circumflex lesion with
an 80% lesion of the major OM branch, and a 90 to 95% lesion
of the right coronary artery.  His left ventricular and
diastolic pressure was 17.  He was referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

MEDICATIONS AT ADMISSION:
1.  Lidocaine 2 mg drip.
2.  Heparin 1000 units per hour at the time he was seen.
3.  Carvedilol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Insulin on a sliding scale administration.
6.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
12. Glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Coumadin 5 mg.  His last dose was two days prior on
[**2114-10-15**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam his lungs are clear
bilaterally.  His heart is irregularly irregular with no
murmur, rub, or gallop.  He has positive bowel sounds.  His
abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  His extremities
have no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  He is alert and
oriented times three.  Neurologically:  Grossly intact.  His
pupils are equally round and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  The patient
does have upper and lower dentures.  He has 2+ carotid pulses
bilaterally, 2+ radial pulses bilaterally, 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulse on the left with nonpalpable dorsalis pedis pulse on
the right and 1+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative labs as follows:  White count
6.0, hematocrit 37.9, platelet count 141,000, sodium 133,
potassium 3.9, chloride 98, bicarbonate 27, BUN 11,
creatinine 0.7, blood sugar 258, PT 15.4, INR 1.6, PTT 36.7
on Heparin, ALT 28, AST 14, alkaline phosphatase 56, amylase
51, total bilirubin 0.7.  Arterial blood gas on 2 liters
nasal cannula was 7.40/46/169.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  He remained awaiting the decrease in his
INR to a normal range prior to his cardiac surgery.  Was
followed every day by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], [**Doctor Last Name **], or Dr. [**Known firstname **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1104**].  He had no high-grade ventricular ectopy in the day
or two prior to surgery, no confusion or central nervous
system changes on Lidocaine, and no congestive heart failure
by exam.  He, again, was awaiting drop in his INR for
surgery.  On [**2114-10-21**], day prior to surgery, his exam was
relatively unchanged.

On the morning of surgery his INR dropped to 1.4, and on
[**2114-10-22**] he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times
three by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with an endarterectomy with a right
coronary artery grafts as follows:  LIMA to LAD vein graft to
OM and vein graft to PDA.  He was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on a
Dobutamine drip at 5 mics per kilo per minute and titrated
insulin drip and propofol drip.

On postoperative day one he had no events overnight.  His
Dobutamine was weaned down to 2.5 mics per kilo per minute,
and he seemed to tolerate the decrease in his Dobutamine.  He
had a T-max of 98.6.  He was in the 90s in sinus rhythm,
satting 98% on two liters nasal cannula after his extubation.
His first set of postoperative labs showed a white count of
11.2, hematocrit 29.8, and a platelet count of 109,000,
sodium of 34, potassium 4.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25,
BUN 8, creatinine 0.7, with blood sugar of 98.  An HIT panel
was sent and was pending for his noticeable drop in platelet
count.  He started Lasix diuresis.  Chest x-ray was repeated,
and the plan was to continue to wean his Dobutamine and
discontinue his Swan, and start the diuresis.  He remained in
the Cardiothoracic ICU, on the following day restarted his
Carvedilol, Captopril and aspirin and continued with diuresis
and finished his perioperative antibiotics.

On postoperative day two his hematocrit was 33.7 with a white
count of 11.8.  His BUN and creatinine remained stable.  His
Carvedilol dose was increased.  His chest tubes were
discontinued, and he was seen by Electrophysiology service,
who evaluated him for the possibility of ICD.  Patient went
back into atrial fibrillation once during the day, and they
would continue to follow him on the ET service
postoperatively.  He was also evaluated by Physical Therapy
and rehab services.

On postoperative day three he went back into atrial
fibrillation and his blood pressure was low but stable.  His
heart rate was up approximately 98 with a blood pressure of
92/70.  He was alert and oriented.  His heart rate continued
to be regular.  His lungs were clear.  He had mild peripheral
edema.  The plan was to have him cardioverted by EP on
[**2114-10-25**] and then do a CT study the following day secondary
to his presenting V-tach, and he continued on Digoxin which
was now added into his regimen with the Carvedilol.  He
continued to diurese well on Lasix, and the plan was to
transfer him now to the floor if he was stable post
cardioversion.  Cardioversion was performed on [**2114-10-25**] to
sinus rhythm with no pauses, and he was transferred out to
the floor later in the day.

On postoperative day four he remained in sinus rhythm.  He
continued on his medications, including his oral
anti-diabetes medications.  His exam was unremarkable.  He
had some crackles at the bases of his lungs with some mild
peripheral edema.  His sternal incision was intact, and the
plan was to have AICD done on [**2114-10-26**] during the day,
which he underwent.  ICD was implanted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient was started on Dofetilide therapy by
Electrophysiology service as an anti-rhythmic therapy.  His
ICD was appearing to be functioning appropriately at
interrogation, and appointment for follow up at the Device
Clinic was given to him for Monday, [**2114-11-5**], at 2 p.m.  He
continued to ambulate and work with Physical Therapy and the
nurses on the floor.

On postoperative day number five it was noted that he had a
21-beat episode of V-tach with a heart rate of approximately
150 a minute, which immediately slowed down.  EP reprogrammed
his ICD for a treatment at the level
