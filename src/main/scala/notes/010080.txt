Service:  CARDIAC IC

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male
with no prior known coronary artery disease, who presents
with crushing substernal chest pain beginning at 5 PM
tonight.  He tried Tums with no relief.  The onset was at
rest.  There was no radiation or diaphoresis, nausea,
vomiting, and no dyspnea.  The patient denies any prior
similar symptoms.

There is no family history of smoking or known
hyperlipidemia.  He present to [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital **] Hospital,
where EKG was consistent with an anterior myocardial
infarction.  He received aspirin, Lopressor, nitroglycerin,
Reteplase, Heparin, and Morphine.  He was medflighted to the
[**Hospital1 69**] for emergent cardiac
catheterization.  He was pain free on the flight over to our
hospital and afterwards.

The left heart catheterization revealed the a patent left
vein coronary artery, mild irregularities of the left
circumflex artery.  There were mild irregularities of the
right coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery
was noted to have diffuse disease.  Specifically, there was
40% proximal stenosis, 90% stenosis at the D2 and 50% distal
stenosis.  There as TIMI III flow throughout the artery.
PTCA and stenting was performed at the mid LAD, which
resulted in jailing of the D2.  Angioplasty was attempted of
the D2, but there was a proximal dissection, which was
treated with 1?????? minutes of angioplasty and this dissection
was felt to be stable.  There was TIMI III flow in the LAD,
as well as in the diagonal II following the intervention.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated filling
pressures with a right atrial pressure of 21, pulmonary
artery pressure of 47/20, and mean pulmonary-capillary wedge
pressure of 26.  The patient was brought to the Coronary
Intensive Care Unit on the basis of these elevated filling
pressures, as well as the patient's advanced age.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Melanoma in his right eye, prostate cancer, status post
local XRT, left-sided chest pain status post extensive
cardiac workup including multiple negative stress tests.
2.  Obesity.
3.  Urinary urgency/incontinence.

ALLERGIES:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient runs a mail order company in
[**Location (un) 47**] and employs 50 people under him.  He is married
for 40 years, but his wife died two years ago.  There is no
ethanol or tobacco currently.  He quit 40 years ago.  He
lives a sedentary lifestyle and he is notably dyspneic on
ambulation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  On admission:  The
patient was afebrile, pulse 50, blood pressure 116/56, with a
mean of 76.  Respirations 16.  Oxygen saturation 90% on room
air and 96% on four liters.  GENERAL:   The patient is alert,
in bed, and in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Right pupil is fixed status post
iridectomy.  Left pupil is round and reactive to light.
Mucous membranes dry.  NECK:  There was no JVD and no
lymphadenopathy.  CHEST:  Chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally, anteriorly.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Examination
revealed regular rate and rhythm with distant S1 and S2.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Obese, soft, nontender,
positive bowel sounds.  The groin was notable for arterial
and venous sheets in place in the right groin.  EXTREMITIES:
Extremities were 2+ DP pulses and no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  They were cool to touch.  NEUROLOGICAL:  He was alert
and oriented times three.  Strength in the upper extremities
was [**4-28**].

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission performed at
the outside hospital revealed a white count of 10.1 with the
differential of 15 neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 12%
monocytes, and 2% eosinophils.  Hematocrit was 45.9, platelet
count 291,000, PT 12.7, INR 1.07, PTT 25.2.  Chem 7 revealed
sodium of 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25,
BUN 17, creatinine 1.0, and glucose 119.  CK was 52, and
troponin I was less than 0.04. AST was 23 and ALT was 20.
Chest x-ray, by report, showed mediastinal widening, but no
CHF.  Transthoracic echocardiogram by report showed no
evidence of aortic dissection.  The EKG at the outside
hospital showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 beats per minute
with 3 mm to [**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in leads V2 to V5 with 1 mm to
[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevation in leads V5 through V6.  There was [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevation in leads 1 and AVL and there was T-wave inversion
in lead [**Street Address(2) 42984**] depression.  After catheterization and
stenting, the patient had a normal sinus rhythm at 58 beats
per minute with PVCs noted.  There was Q wave in leads V1
through V3, T-wave inversion in leads V1 through V5, T-wave
flattening in leads V6, 1, and AVL, and 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
elevation in leads V2 to V4.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 83-year-old man with acute anterior
myocardial infarction this evening, who received thrombolysis
at the outside hospital and was Medflighted here for
percutaneous coronary intervention.  Stent was placed in the
mid LAD at the diagonal 2, restoring flow to a 90% lesion
there.

Hospital course by system:

#1.  CARDIAC:  We continued the patient on aspirin and
initiated Plavix therapy, which he should continue for one
month.  Aspirin should be continued indefinitely.  Integrilin
was used during and post catheterization and this was stopped
after 18 hours.  We initiated statin therapy for an LDL of
107 and HDL that was low at 29.  Low-dose beta blocker was
started and titrated up as the blood pressure allowed and
this was ultimately left at Atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d.  The same
was done for an ACE inhibitor, initially with Captopril and
then changing to Zestril, and he was discharged on Zestril 5
mg PO q.d.  The CKs came down during the hospitalization.
Echocardiogram was performed that showed a
moderately-depressed ejection fraction of 35% to 40%. There
was apical dyskinesis with mild and distal anteroseptal and
distal anterior akinesis.  The right ventricular chamber size
and pre-wall motion were normal.  There was trace AI, mildly
thickened mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR and no LV
function thrombus.

The patient remained chest-pain free, however, he did have
continued mild dyspnea, especially on exertion.  Given the
patient's elevated filling pressures and his depressed
ejection fraction after his MI, we initiated therapy with
Furosemide that improved his symptoms somewhat, although, not
completely.  We noted that the patient had had baseline
dyspnea on exertion even before his MI, but he stated that
his symptoms were worse during this hospitalization than he
is used to prior.  Therefore, we discharged him on Lasix 40
mg PO q.d.  Volume status should be addressed promptly after
discharge, preferably within one to two weeks.  In addition,
the BUN and creatinine should be followed, as well as the
potassium.

#2.  GENITOURINARY:  Initially, the patient had Foley
catheter placed as he needed to remain at bed rest for the
first twenty-four hour of the hospitalization.  There was
significant hematuria noted and this was felt to be likely
multifactorial due to his thrombolysis, Integrilin, and
history of local XRT that made possible the diagnosis of
radiation cystitis.  The bladder was flushed with normal
sale.  Foley catheter was removed and replaced with condom
catheter and Pyridium was given for symptomatic benefit.
However, the patient continued to have complaints of urgency
and frequency.  The urinalysis was positive and grew E coli.
Sensitivities were still pending at the time of discharge,
however, he was initiated on Levofloxacin for an intended
course of seven days.

#3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:   Cardiac healthy
diet was provided.  Potassium and magnesium were repleted as
necessary.

#4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit and platelet count
remained stable.  There were no bleeding complications.

#5.  PROPHYLAXIS:  Heparin subcutaneously was given for
prophylaxis, as well as Protonix.

#6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a temperature spike
to 100
