URINE CX: CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML

IMAGING:
HEAD CT/CTA- CODE STROKE
1. Findings consistent with a small infarct core in the left
external
capsule, and a large surrounding ischemic penumbra involving the
entire left MCA territory.
2. Filling defect in the left M1 segment with distal
reconstitution of the
superior division, likely via the extracranial circulation,
suggestive of a component of chronic occlusion. Reconstitution
of the inferior division is less well seen.
3. Severe emphysema in the imaged upper lungs. Nodular density
in the right lung apex measuring 10 x 3 mm, for which a PET-CT
or follow-up CT chest in 3 months is recommended.
4. Calcification of both glenohumeral joints with fluid noted in
the left
glenohumeral joint, incompletely characterized.

TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the distal anterior septum, distal anterior wall
and apex.. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its
severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified. Mild focal
LV systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-7-21**],
the function of the distal anterior/antero-septal segments is
slightly better.

BRAIN MRI
1. Small acute infarction in the left external capsule.
2. Chronic microvascular infarcts in the supratentorial white
matter and
right pons.

CXR
1. No pneumonia.

2. Bilateral protrusions of the humeral heads with a new
fracture of the
right clavicle.

3. Bilateral erosions of the surgical necks of humeri. Clinical
correlation
is recommended.

4. Large hiatal remains unchanged. Right upper lobe scarring
appears
unchanged.

CT HEAD (24 hours post-TPA)
Subtle hypodensity at the site of previously MRI-demonstrated
infarct is noted. No new abnormalities are seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo RHW with h/o CAD, PAF, HTN presents with acute onset right
sided weakness and slurred speech, found to have L MCA
occlusion, s/p t-PA with good recovery of deficits.

# NEURO: Patient presented with acute right sided weakness in
arm and leg, that worsened over about 1 hour prior to
presentation. She also had slurred speech.
A code stroke was called on presentation to the ED. Head CT and
CTA revealed L MCA cut-off consistent with occlusion. CT
perfusion showed increased mean transit time, with preserved
volume, consistent with salvageable brain tissue. The risks and
benefits were discussed with the patient, and t-PA was
administered at 4 hours 10 minutes. After less than 30 minutes,
patient was able to move right arm and leg. After about 45
minutes of t-PA infusion, patient c/o headache. t-PA was stopped
and repeat head CT was stable with no bleed.
Patient was admitted to neuro ICU. Her deficits on exam had
substantially improved, she remained with 4+/5 right deltoid
strength but biceps, triceps, wrist flex/ext, and finger flex/ex
all [**5-3**] and symmetric. Speech had returned to baseline.
MRI showed small area of infarct in the L MCA distribution.
Workup for stroke etiology included TTE, telemetry, fasting
lipids, HBA1c. Of note, patient was in atrial fibrillation on
presentation to the ED, and does have a history of PAF. She had
not been anticoagulated previously due to difficulty maintaining
a constant INR in the past. She remained in sinus rhythm on
telemetry. TTE showed mildly reduced EF (40-45%) and hypokinesis
inferiorly c/w prior MI.
It was thought that the etiology of stroke was likely embolic
from AF with reduced EF. Patient agreed to start coumadin. She
was bridged with ASA due to a heparin sensitivity in the past.

Once a therapeutic INR is reached patient can be lowered back to
Aspirin 81 mg PO daily for cardiovascular protection.

Fasting lipids were moderately elevated, and patient was started
on low dose statin. Hba1c was wnl.

# CV: remained in SR after initial AF. BP was 100-120/80s and at
baseline, did not require any intervention. Home lisinopril was
initially held. Lisinopril was added back.  On d/c patient did
not appear fluid [**Month/Day (1) 103777**] and no lasix was added back.  A beta
blocker was not introduced secondary to low heart rate.  patient
did have frequent PVC's and mg, phos, ca were within normal
limits.  This d/c summary will be sent to patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
