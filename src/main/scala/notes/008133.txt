Service:  SURGERY/GOLD

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 72-year-old female, with a
history of hypertension, COPD, renal cell carcinoma, status
post left renal nephrectomy in [**2167**], sigmoid disorder, who
was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on the [**3-24**]
after having one day of severe abdominal pain associated with
nausea and vomiting.  Per report, the patient's symptoms were
associated with eating [**Male First Name (un) 19450**] candy.  An ER amylase was
1,977 and a lipase was 7,508.  Right upper quadrant
ultrasound revealed gallstones, 5 mm normal CBD.  The
patient's white count was 16.2, crit elevated at 46, blood
glucose 213, AST 217, ALT 224.  T-bili was reportedly normal.
Chest x-ray was normal.  EKG revealed frequent PVCs, an old
MI.  A KUB revealed small calcifications in the right side of
the abdomen, ?stones.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU for
pancreatitis, after physical evaluation was requested.  The
patient received vigorous IVF hydration, Zosyn, morphine prn
pain control.  Dilantin was given and the patient was made
NPO for bowel rest and had Foley placed for careful I's and
O's.

By hospital day #2, the patient's white count had risen from
16.2 to 23.  Crit was stable at 45.  Calcium was 7.3.
Amylase and lipase were at 1,345 and 5,865, respectively.
The patient had low urine output, around 30 cc/h, with good
pain control, and no further nausea and vomiting.  The orders
and plans for lap-chole once the pancreatitis resolved were
put into place.  By the [**3-26**], the patient was
started on BiPAP secondary to increased respiratory rate, and
increased O2 necessary secondary to 7.29, 4,562 blood gas.
No signs of CHF per interval.  Intermittent chest x-ray
revealed moderate left pleural effusions and small lung
volume, as the patient was noted to be 5-liter positive
secondary to aggressive IVF hydration.

The patient was subsequently intubated secondary to increased
respiratory rate and PA to 50 even on BIPAP.  CT scan of the
abdomen on [**2169-3-26**] showed a nonenhancing tail and a
portion of the body of the pancreas consistent with necrosis,
a large fluid collection at [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch, and bilateral
atelectasis with pleural effusions.  The patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for management of necrotizing
pancreatitis and hypoxic respiratory failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
3. Renal cell carcinoma status post resection in [**2167-2-10**].
4. Appendectomy.
5. Liver hemangioma.
6. Breast cyst.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Dilantin 100 mg po tid.
2. Norvasc.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A 50-pack year history of smoking.  No
ethanol use.  Seven children.  Divorced.  Works at school
cafeteria.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 100.7, 99, normal sinus rhythm,
frequent PVCs, 150/54 blood pressure.  Generally, obese,
sedate heart.  HEENT - no scleral icterus.  Cardiac revealed
normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was positive for
epigastric pain, no rebound, guarding.  Extremities had no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABS UPON PRESENTATION:  White count 23, crit 45, 222
platelets.  Chem-7 - 148/4.2, 116/22, 29/1.1, 218 glucose.
INR 1.1, PT 13.2, PTT 20.2, AST 52, ALT 85, T-bili 0.8,
amylase from 1,977 to 1,345, now 901.  Lipase from 7,508 to
5,856, now 2,672.  Albumin at 2.5, total protein of 5.5.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 72-year-old female, with
hypertension, COPD, renal cell carcinoma, presenting with
necrotizing pancreatitis with increased white count,
increased hematocrit, decreased calcium, and hypoxic
respiratory failure.  The plan was to vigorously hydrate the
patient with continuous boluses, check venous lactates.  The
patient was to be placed on goal-directed protocol,
meropenem.

ICU COURSE AS FOLLOWS:  The patient was intubated for airway
protection and was finally extubated and remained as such.
Her nutritional status was addressed by TPN while she was
NPO, which she is continuing on currently, being supplemented
with PO intake.  Otherwise, her tenderness resolved while in
the unit.  Upon transferring to the floor, the patient's LFTs
were as follows:  T-bili 0.6, alk phos 265, ALT 56, amylase
90, AST 102.

The patient received physical therapy beginning during her
unit course, and it was continued while on the floor.  On the
floor, the patient gradually increased her PO intake, and her
TPN was decreased from an initial 2 liters to 1 liter upon
discharge.  The patient will be discharged to an acute rehab
facility where she will receive continued physical therapy,
and she will be followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
approximately 2-3 weeks.  Until that time, the patient is to
remain on a clear liquid diet, and to continue her 1 liter
bags of TPN, with adjustment as needed for electrolyte
changes.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Heparin subcu 5,000 q 8 h.
2. Albuterol 4 puffs IH q 4 h prn.
3. Tylenol 325-650 mg PR q 4-6 prn fever and pain.
4. Insulin sliding scale.
5. Tegretol 100 mg po tid.
6. Protonix 40 mg po q 24 h.
7. Lopressor 50 mg po bid with holding parameters.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
