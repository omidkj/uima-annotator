HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with shortness of
breath and hypoxia with infiltrates on chest x-ray, who
presents with likely pneumonia.  The patient was continued on
Levofloxacin and Flagyl for a full seven day course.  Blood
cultures were sent which were negative.  The patient was also
gently diuresed.

The patient seemed to rapidly improve from her admission and
was thought that it might have been secondary to diuresis.  A
chest CT scan was proposed but was not done at this time,
considering that the patient did not want any invasive
procedures if anything were to be found on chest CT scan.

The patient's hypoxia improved and she was saturating 93 to
97% on five liters nasal cannula.

2.  In terms of the patient's hypertension, the patient was
continued on her beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, aspirin, Imdur
and her blood pressure remained stable.

The patient's renal functioning showed worsening creatinine
to 2.0 baseline, however, the day after admission, it
improved to 1.8 despite diuresis.  FEna was 6.8.  P.o.'s were
encouraged and the patient's creatinine was continued to be
monitored.  No interventions were taken.

3.  Possible dementia/psychosis:  The patient appeared
confused on admission, however, improved with Haldol p.r.n.
The patient's mental status also improved with treatment of
her infection.

4.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The patient was
maintained on a regular diet and had Protonix prophylaxis
while in the Intensive Care Unit.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Multifocal pneumonia of unclear etiology.
