Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted with respiratory failure believed to be related
to asthma and recent diagnosis of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].

The patient was intubated in the ED.  She spent 4 days on the
ventilator.  She recieved 2 rounds of every other day
plasmapheresis prior to extubation.  She then got one more round
of plasmapheresis, after which it was felt that she had improved
to the point that such therapy was no longer indicated.   During
this time her cellcept was increased from 1000 to 1500BID, her
prednisone was changed from 20mg QOD to solumedrol 48mg qd
(equivalent of 60mg qod), and mestinon was held.  The patient's
respiratory function further improved with albuterol PRN and
advair, which was started after the patient reached the floor.


The patient had low grade fevers for which cultures and chest
imaging were obtained.  These were negative.

Blood sugar was kept below 140 with a RISS.

The patient was put on tube feeds whiles she was intubated.

The patient had a paradoxical elevation of her PTT to
subcutaneous heparin.  This was then held and then restarted at
[**Hospital1 **] rather than TID dosing.  Her PTT stablized with these
interventions.
