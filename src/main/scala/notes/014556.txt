PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography showed a totally occluded
mid
LAD. We planned to revascularize the vessel. Eptifibatide was
continued.
A 6 French XBLAD3.5 guide provided suboptimal support. The
lesion was
crossed with a Choice PT wire and intraluminal position was
confirmed by
distal injection through the PTCA balloon. The wire was then
exchanged
for a Whisper wire was positioned in the distal vessel with
great
difficulties due to severe tortuousity of the vessel. The mid
and
proximal LAD were then dilated with a 2.0x15 mm Maverick balloon
for 3
inflations at 10 and 12 Atm. Attempts to deliver a 2.25x18 mm
Pixel
stent were unsuccessful due to severe proximal calcification.
The wire
was exchanged again for a Stabilizer wire at which point a
spiral
dissection of the distal vessel was noted. Given the severe
tortuousity
and calcification of the vessel and normal flow, we decided to
terminate
the procedure. Final angiography showed a 50% residual stenosis,
a
spiral dissection and TIMI 3 flow. Echocardiography revealed a
small
pericardial effusion and no cardiac tamponade. The patient left
the lab
in critical but stable condition.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a left dominant
system
with three vessel CAD.  The left main had a proximal 40% lesion.
 The
LAD was heavily calcified and tortuous.  The proximal LAD had a
80%
calcific stenosis.  The LAD was totally occluded after D1.  The
D1
branch had a 90% proximal stenosis.  The left circumflex was
diffusely
diseased with a mid 60% stenosis.  The OM1 had an ostial 90%
stenosis.
The OM2 was totally occluded and filled via collaterals.  The
PDA had a
70% stenosis at its origin.  The RCA was diminutive and
non-dominant
with a 70% stenoses.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated left and
right
sided filling pressures.  The cardiac index was markedly
depressed,
based on an assumed oxygen consumption index.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. Unsuccessful PTCA of the LAD with a 2.0 mm balloon. Final
angiography
showed a 50% residual stenosis, a spiral dissection and normal
flow (see
PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Markedly depressed cardiac index.
3. Acute STEMI
4. Unsuccessful PTCA of the LAD.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Moderate regional
LV systolic dysfunction.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. Effusion echo dense,
c/w blood,
inflammation or other cellular elements.

Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (distal
half of the
anterior wall is severely hypokinetic. Apex is mildly
dyskinetic.) There is a
small primarily inferolateral somewhat echodense pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study of earlier in the afternoon, the
left
ventricular cavity is larger (now normal). Regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction is now appreciated. The size of the partially echo
dense
pericardial effusion is similar.
If clinically indicated, serial evaulation is suggested.
