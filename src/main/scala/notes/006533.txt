there is continued clinical concern for acute
ischemia/infarction, MRI with
DWI would be more sensitive.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female nursing home resident with CAD, dCHF, DM,
frequent UTIs presented with altered mental status and hypoxia.
.
# Altered Mental Status: CT head negative for acute pathology.
No evidence of UTI or bacteremia. Suspect transient
AMS/confusion from hypoxia secondary to volume overload.
AMS/confusion improved and at baseline, after speaking with
family.
.
# Hypoxia: Required Bipap in ED. ABG supported chronic
respiratory acidosis or acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.
Given hilar fullness on chest x-ray plus elevated BNP, likely
congestive heart failure exacerbation.  Etiology of
decompensation was unclear given that she has been taking
medications at her nursing home and denies dietary changes. EKG
unchanged so less likely to be ischemia.  Pt was diuresed with
IV lasix. Echo was repeated showing moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Spoke with NP and physicians at [**Hospital3 2558**] and
patient will be discharged on supplemental oxygen therapy, as
her O2 sats were 90% on RA during her admission after diuresis.
.
# Hyponatremia: initially appeared hypervolemic, likely [**1-22**] CHF.
Fluid restricted and IV lasix given with normalization of
sodium.
.
# Macrocytic anemia:  No signs or symptoms of bleeding,
hemodynamically stable, baseline hct ~30.
.
# CAD: EKG unchanged, cardiac enzymes negative, never complained
of chest pain.
Continued [**Month/Day (2) **], lisinopril, zocor, isosorbide per home regimen.
Atenolol was held in setting of bradycardia (HR 45-55), and will
need to address resumption with primary care doctor.
.
# HTN: well controlled and continued on previous regimen.
.
# DM2: on ISS at admission, will resume prandin at NH
