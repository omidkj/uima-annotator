CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 78-year-old
gentlemen with a known history of coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass [**Year (4 digits) **] in [**2112**] (grafts are
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein [**Year (4 digits) **] to right coronary artery and saphenous
vein [**Year (4 digits) **] to OM).  He has been followed by his primary care
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 78297**].  On [**2129-10-26**] patient underwent
cardiac catheterization which showed native three vessel
disease, a proximally occluded saphenous vein [**Year (4 digits) **] to OM, a
patent saphenous vein [**Year (4 digits) **] to right coronary artery, a
patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending.  An echocardiogram which was done on [**2132-10-16**] showed inferoposterior hypokinesis with ejection
fraction of 45-50%.  It also showed mild mitral regurgitation
and aortic stenosis.

Patient reports having worsening dyspnea on exertion over the
past months.  He becomes short of breath after taking
relatively short walks about 100 feet or so or climbing
stairs.  He also has lightheadedness and lower extremity
edema.  Patient had a stress Myoview on [**2133-4-10**].
During the exercise, he denied any chest pain, had shortness
of breath.  An electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions
in V4 through V6.  Patient is referred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation and
work-up.

pneumonia, minimal bibasilar atelectasis.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm rate of 63,
occasional premature ventricular contraction.  There are T
wave inversions in leads I and aVL.

Carotid study pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Medical Service
for his worsening dyspnea and positive exercise tolerance
test.  Patient underwent cardiac catheterization which was
significant for an ejection fraction of 55%, showed a patent
saphenous vein [**Year (4 digits) **] to right coronary artery [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
occluded saphenous vein [**First Name3 (LF) **] presumably to left anterior
descending [**First Name3 (LF) **], the left main was normal.  There is an 80%
proximal left anterior descending stenosis and distally the
left anterior descending was occluded.  The left internal
mammary artery, which was previously reported to be grafted
to left anterior descending was patent and not grafted and a
circumflex system was not grafted as previously reported.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and was then
evaluated by Cardiothoracic Surgery Team.  He was also
evaluated by Endocrine for asymptomatic hypercalcemia
secondary to hyperparathyroidism, which was monitored.

On hospital day two, the patient was taken to the Operating
Room under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Cardiothoracic Team where he
underwent a redo coronary artery bypass [**Last Name (STitle) **] times three
with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
distal, saphenous vein [**Last Name (STitle) **] to left anterior descending
proximal, saphenous vein [**Last Name (STitle) **] to OM.  He tolerated this
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Unit in stable condition.

Postoperatively, patient remained hemodynamically stable.  He
was weaned off drips.  Patient failed ventilatory wean times
two.  He was noted to have diffuse wheezing and rales on
exam.  Patient was placed on nebulizer treatments, inhaler
treatments and was evaluated by the Pulmonary Medicine Team.
They recommended optimizing fluid balance and continuing with
nebulizers until patient stabilized.

Patient continued to undergo weaning from the ventilatory
support and was extubated successfully on postoperative day
number one.  Post extubation, patient developed laryngeal
edema and was given racemic epinephrine by the respiratory
therapist and the edema resolved.  Patient's respiratory
status continued to slowly improve with aggressive pulmonary
toilet and nebulizer treatments with albuterol and Atrovent
and gentle diuresis.

On postoperative day number two, patient's respiratory status
continued to improve.  Patient's chest tubes were
discontinued without incident.  Patient's hematocrit remained
stable.  Patient remained hemodynamically stable with
occasional premature ventricular contractions seen on the
monitor.  The patient remained under close monitor in the
Intensive Care Unit for the next few days as pulmonary status
continued to improve.  Otherwise, patient was tolerating diet
and remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile.

Of note, prior to OR, patient underwent cystoscopy guided
Foley catheter insertion secondary to stricture in the
urethra. This was done by the Urology Service.  Patient
tolerated that well and had no urologic issues
postoperatively.

Patient, on postoperative day number four, was transferred to
the floor in stable condition.  Patient was continued on
aggressive on pulmonary toilet.  Patient was seen by Physical
Therapy and has achieved a level 5 activity with good 02
saturations on room air.  Patient's Foley was discontinued on
postoperative day number five and has been able to void.
Patient has been followed by Urology and will have an
outpatient follow-up with this service.

On postoperative day number seven, on examination, patient's
wound appeared to be slightly erythematous.  Patient was
started on intravenous Kefzol.  After no improvement over the
ensuing day, the patient was switched to intravenous
vancomycin.  Patient's wound was observed.  There was no
drainage.  The wound remained intact.  Cellulitis has
resolved after five days of vancomycin intravenously.
Patient remained afebrile during this time and patient will
be discharged with a po clindamycin for an extended period of
time for the wound cellulitis.

Otherwise, patient remained stable and is tolerating a
cardiac diet and has been restarted on all medications po and
is now stable and ready for discharge with VNA Service.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post redo coronary artery
bypass [**Last Name (STitle) **] times three.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Hyperpa
