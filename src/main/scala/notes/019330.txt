Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization
2. Percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting of the right
coronary artery with Cypher stent


History of Present Illness:
70yo man w/ PMH of DM on insulin admitted with chest pressure x
2days. He noted SSCP 9.5/10 beginning on Sunday and lasting
through Monday. He reported associated lethargy, but no dyspnea,
nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, radiation, or
aggravating/alleviating factors. On Tuesday morning, the pain
had resolved but he went to his PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29357**] on request of
his wife and was found to have an EKG with Q waves and ST
elevations in the inferior leads. He was sent to [**Hospital 1474**]
hospital, which sent him here. In the cath lab, he was found to
have a mid RCA 99% long lesion at the acute marginal take off
with slow flow. He was stented with a 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher DES
with resulting good flow. The acute marginal was jailed by the
stent but maintained good flow. He was noted to have an RA
pressure equal to the PCWP at 19 and was thus admitted to the
CCU. On arrival to the CCU, he denied any chest pressure,
lethargy, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, pain, or other complaints.
On ROS, he notes leg paresthesias that are worse in the am and
not worse with exercise. He reports an exercise tolerance of [**1-4**]
flights of stairs. He reports poor compliance with diabetic
diet. Notes significant past history of alcohol and tobacco use
(multiple admissions for detox quitting 30yrs ago and
100pack-year history ending 15 years ago). Denies any
significant family history.

Cath report:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Completed acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by
PCI of the mid-RCA.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
system. LMCA, LAD and LCx had very minimal disease. The RCA had
a mid
99% long lesion at the acute marginal take off. Initial flow was
TIMI
One.
2. Left ventriculography showed a normal ejection fraction with
no
wall motion abnormalities and no mitral regurgitation.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed elevated RVEDP of 19 mm Hg with
RVEDP/LVEDP ration > 0.8. RV pulse pressure was depressed. Y
descent on the RA tracing was accentuated. CI was depressed at
1.4 L/min/m2. This was consistent with RV infarction physiology.
Systemic aortic pressure was low normal.
4. Successful PCI of the mid-RCA with a 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher DES.
.
Imaging:
OSH CXR by report: limited study, ?RLL consolidation
CXR (PA/lat): 1. Probable right lower lobe pneumonia. Please
confirm resolution after treatment to exclude the possibility of
underlying neoplastic process.
2. Prominent mediastinum indicating mediastinal fat Vs.
lymphadenopathy.
CXR (AP): A roughly triangular region of opacification extends
inferiorly from the right hilus is probably largely atelectasis
but raises concern for bronchial obstruction and should be
followed until clear. Right hilus is slightly larger than the
left, also a concern for adenopathy. Heart size is normal. There
is mild fullness in the mediastinum, particularly in the right
paratracheal area, another region of possible adenopathy or
alternatively vascular engorgement. There are no pleural
abnormalities. Remainder of the lungs is clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 70yo man with several cardiac risk factors including
DM, h/o tobacco use, presenting with q waves and ST elevations
in the inferior distribution after resolving chest pain, noted
to have a 99% occluded RCA by cath now s/p stent, but sent to
the CCU for RA pressures = PCWP and concern of RV infarct.
.
Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:
.
1. [**Name (NI) **] - Pt was found to have 99% occlusion of the mid-RCA,
which was stented with a Cypher stent. The stent of the RCA
jailed the acute marginal, but good flow was maintained through
this vessel. MI was most likely completed by admission given q
waves, resolution of CP, and CKs trending down on admission. He
was treated post-catheterization with integrilin for 18 hours,
then [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], lipitor 80mg, lisinopril 5mg. Beta-blocker was
held on the recommendation of the cardiology fellow given the
patient's right-sided infarct and concern for conduction system
abnormalities as well as heart failure.
1a. Cardiac risk factors: A lipid panel revealed TG 102, HDL 39,
LDL 87, chol/HD ratio 3.7. HbA1C was 8.8 and the patient
reported poor compliance with a diabetic diet. He was encouraged
to improve his diet and exercise.
.
2. Right sided failure - The cardiac catheterization revealed RA
pressures of 19, which was elevated and equal to PCWP. This is
consistent with RV infarct physiology and implies right sided
failure. Given this picture, pt was admitted to the CCU for
monitoring. His blood pressure remained stable throughout his
hospitalization course. He was allowed to auto-diurese as he had
good urine output and diuretics had great risk for dropping his
preload and causing hypotension. His LVEF was 60%.
.
3. Cardiac dysrhythmias - The patient was noted initially to
have first degree AV block with a PR interval as long as 340ms
(discharge interval). He was monitored by telemetry and daily
EKGs and was noted at times to be in Weinkebach. Beta-blocker
was held given concern for further conduction abnormalities with
the right sided infarct. This can be started at the discretion
of his primary care physician.
.
4. Hypoxia - On admission, the patient had an oxygen requirement
and desaturated to 92% on room air. A CXR report from the OSH
noted a possible RLL consolidation. A repeat CXR revealed an
opacity that was consistent with pneumonia, but could not
exclude neoplasm, especially as a widened mediastinum that could
be secondary to hilar lymphadenopathy was also seen. For a
possible pneumonia, the patient was treated with a 7 day course
of levofloxacin. His white count, which was elevated to 13.7 on
admission, decreased to 10.3 on disch
