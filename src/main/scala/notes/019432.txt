Date of Birth:  [**2119-8-19**]             Sex:   F

Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
N/V/F/C/night sweats/cough/SOB/DOE/orthopnea at OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal echocardiogram.


History of Present Illness:
41 F with h/o endocarditis 12 yrs ago s/p MV annuloplasty/repair
w/ subsequent dehiscence of valve requiring MVR ([**Hospital3 **]) in
'[**58**] with maze procedure; CHF(EF >55% 3+ MR); h/o Aflutter.
Presented to OSH w/ 1 day N/V/F/C/night
sweats/cough/SOB/DOE/orthopnea. W/u at OSH included CTA neg for
PE, but revealing pna and CHF. Echo done showed evidence of clot
in mitral valve vs possible vegetation. She was empirically
started on vanc/gent/rifampin for endocarditis though the
patient had wbc WNL and was found to be afebrile. Pt had stopped
taking her meds 5 mo ago (including coumadin) due to lack of
money. Pt was also found to have urine positive for cocaine,
opiates, and cannabinoids at the OSH.


Past Medical History:
anxiety, Aflutter, cervical CA s/p cryotherapy, h/o
polysubstance abuse, annuloplasty/repair of MV 12 yrs ago with
subsequent MVR ([**Hospital3 9642**]) 2 yrs ago

Social History:
Currently living w/friends. [**Name (NI) 44847**] as a baby sitter, smokes
(transferred on a nicotine patch), denies using etoh, cocaine

Physical Exam:
Afebrile
Gen: appears fatigued and dishelved
HEENT: miotic pupils, MMM, sclerae anicteric
CV: III/VI holosystolic murmer
Lungs: soft crackles throughout
abd: soft, NT/ND, pos BS
Ext: trace edema

Brief Hospital Course:
41 F with a PMH sig for CHF(EF >55% 3+ MR), chronic Aflutter,
and endocarditis 12 yrs ago s/p MV annuloplasty/repair w/
subsequent dehiscence of valve requiring MVR ([**Hospital3 **]) in '[**58**]
with maze procedure transferred from an OSH for evaluation of a
clot on her mitral valve vs a vegetation seen on echo, after not
taking her coumadin x5 months. Pt was empirically started on
vanc/gent/rifampin for endocarditis.

Studies:
1. Cath ([**10-14**]): clean coronaries, elevated PCW, decreased CO,
nl EF, severe MR
2. CT chest @ OSH: prominent pulm vasculature, dilated LA and
pulm veins c/w pulm HTN, b/l pleural effusion R>L. No PE.
3. TTE ([**7-25**]): mobile mass on MV ~0.8 cm, ? clot vs vegetation
w/ septal paradoxical [**Last Name (LF) 44848**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 45%, LV fxn mildly depressed
4. TEE ([**7-25**]): EF>60%; A 3.5cm long by 1cm thick mural thrombus
(cannot exclude vegetation or superimposed vegetation) is seen
in the body of the LA involving the mitral prosthesis
(completely surrounding one disc that is immobile) and extending
along in a "mural" fashion the interatrial septum and posterior
aortic root
A definite 3-4mm partially mobile thrombus is seen in the
mid-portion of the appendage.
5. TTE ([**7-27**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric LVH. The LV cavity size is normal.(LVEF>55%). RV
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. AV leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
AR. The AV leaflets are mildly thickened. A bileaflet MV
prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well
seated, The anteriorl leaflet/disc motion is restricted with a
small mass at that site, consistent with a thrombus. The
transvalvular gradients are higher than expected for this type
of prosthesis.(gradient of 10 dwn from 20) The estimated PASP is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Problems:

1. Mobile mass/Clot on MV: (most likely clot vs vegetation)
- pt informed of risk of stroke w/lysis (20%) vs.
obstruction/deterioration of valve w/no tx. TPA done on [**7-27**].
Repeat TTE showed improved gradient across mechanical MV but
persistent clot. Pt did not have further lysis.
- started on heparin gtt on admission with transition to
coumadin
- low suspicion for endocarditis so d/c'ed gent, rifampin, vanco

*
2. Pump: EF >55% w/3+ MR
- no S/Sx of overload. Fluid goal even.
*
3. Rhythm: Aflutter w/occasional rapid HR
- restarted metoprolol for rate control (had been held for
hypoTN)
- no indication for cardioversion
*
4. Neuro/Psych: polysubstance abuse/anxiety
- pre-lysis CT head w/old lacunar infarcts; question of small
bleed, however neurorads felt unlikely--more likely
calcification of choroid plexus
- no signs of withdrawal, Ativan prn for agitation
- SW/case management helped follow pt and set up free care for
meds at discharge
- Psych consult obtained, suggest giving haldol prn for
agitation and trazadone for insomnia, hold Bz's unless physical
signs of w/drawel (CIWA scale written)
5. RLL PNA: afebrile, WBC stable
- treated with course of Levoflox for CAP
- Bld Cx NG, Sputum Cx NG
Left against medical advice.
