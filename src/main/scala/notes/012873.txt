ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Gastrointestinal bleed with
hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year-old man
with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection
fraction of 10 to 15% who has a chronic gastrointestinal
bleed and chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of
2.  He is sent to the Emergency Department by his primary
care physician on the day of admission for a hematocrit of
22.5 and for increased fatigue.

In the Emergency Department his initial vital signs were a
heart rate of 78 with a blood pressure of 88/49, sating 99%
on room air.  His initial hematocrit was 22.5.  The patient
was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells and
volume resuscitated with 1.5 liters of normal saline.  His
blood pressure then improved to 100 systolic.  The patient's
blood pressure range in the Emergency Department over the
first four hours were between 78 and 83 systolic.  The
patient continued to mentate.  His urine output was
approximately 300 cc.  The patient complained of intermittent
nausea.  His oxygen saturations was 97% on 4 liters by nasal
cannula.  In the Emergency Room he had a chest x-ray that
showed stable mild congestive heart failure.

The patient denied an lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations.  He did have some
abdominal discomfort across the upper abdomen.  He reported
chronic black stools, but denied bright red blood per rectum.
He denies any recent syncope.  He reported normally his
blood pressure is in the low 100s.  The patient refused
nasogastric lavage in the Emergency Department.

patient is an elderly man who is pleasant and in no acute

bilaterally.  There is no sclera icterus.  The mucous
membranes are dry.  There is 10 cm of JVP on the neck.  There

sounds.  S1 and S2 are normal.  There is no S3 or S4.  There
are no murmurs.  There is an enlarged sustained point of
maximal impulse.  The chest is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Bowel sounds are presents.  The abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  No masses are palpated.
There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  The extremities have
purpuric patch on the right medial leg.  The extremities are
warm.  The distal pulses are intact.  There is no edema.  The
skin has normal turgor.  There are no rashes.  The patient is
alert and oriented times three.  Speech is normal.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count is 4.6, hematocrit 22.5,
platelets 160, MCV 89, sodium 140, potassium 4.5, chloride
104, bicarb 26, BUN 68, creatinine 2.6, glucose 100.  An
electrocardiogram shows mild stable congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram shows AV paced at 71.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy done on [**2176-10-19**] showed
grade two esophagitis.  A colonoscopy done in [**2176-3-19**]
showed diverticulosis at the sigmoid colon.  In [**2178-1-17**]
iron studies revealed a ferritin of 49, reticulocyte count of
1.8, TIBC of 130 and TRF of 331.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service.

1.  Anemia:  The patient's anemia was felt to be secondary to
gastrointestinal blood loss as well as chronic renal failure.
The patient had refused nasogastric lavage in the Emergency
Department, but it was suspected that his gastrointestinal
bleed was from a lower source.  The patient was started on
Epogen shots 10,000 units q Tuesday.  He also refused a
gastrointestinal consult.

The GI Service performed both an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
and a colonoscopy.  These did not reveal a source of the
bleed.  The patient was maintained on Protonix b.i.d. with
two large bore intravenous at all times. His hematocrit was
checked b.i.d.  The patient required several units of packed
red blood cells during this admission to keep his hematocrit
above 30.  There have been plans to perform a small bowel
capsule study to elucidate if the source of his bleeding was
from the small bowel.  However, given that the patient has a
pacemaker we are unable to perform this study.

At the time of discharge the patient's hematocrit has been
stable at approximately 30 for three days.  He has been
guaiac negative for several days on the floor.  It is hoped
that the patient will be stable for discharge home.  He will
follow up with his primary care physician and have his
hematocrit followed closely.  The patient knows to return
should he develop any black stools or feel lightheaded.
Initially the patient was admitted to the MICU to monitor his
gastrointestinal bleed.  He received aggressive fluid
hydration in the Intensive Care Unit as well as a transfusion
of 2 units of packed red blood cells.  He then stabilized and
was ready for transfer to the floor.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10 to 15%.  The
congestive heart failure service was consulted during this
admission.  Given the patient's hypotension many of his
medications were discontinued or the doses were lowered.
During his stay in the hospital the patient has managed to
tolerate Toprol XL 12.5 mg po q.d. and Lisinopril 5 mg po
q.d. with systolic blood pressures running at approximately
100.

The patient will follow up with the congestive heart failure
clinic to have his medications titrated up as tolerated.
Please note that at the time of discharge the patient has not
received Lasix for approximately five days and has not had
spironolactone at all during this admission.  The patient
remained asymptomatic from a cardiovascular point of view
during his stay in the hospital and required Lasix prn
minimally.

3.  Chronic renal failure:  The patient's creatinine was
slightly elevated upon admission at 2.6.  This was felt to be
secondary to a prerenal state from his gastrointestinal
bleed.  The patient received aggressive hydration for his
hypovolemia and upon discharge his creatinine is 1.3.

4.  Hypernatremia:  Patient received a colonoscopy on [**3-26**].
During his prep for this he received GoLYTELY.  He was also
kept NPO overnight prior to the procedure.  On the following
day the patient's sodium was noted to be 153.  This was felt
to be secondary to dehydration from the GoLYTELY prep as well
as being NPO.  The patient was given approximately half a
liter of D5W and was allowed to drink following his procedure
and his sodium normalized.

5.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient has a pacemaker.  He is
not on anticoagulation secondary to his chronic
gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient was evaluated by the physiotherapy service and
was felt to be safe for discharge home.  The patient will
have VNA Service
