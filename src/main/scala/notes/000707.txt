Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  50yo man with ESRD on PD, DM, CAD s/p NSTEMI, CHF with EF
20%, and HT, admitted with hypotension and acute on chronic
renal failure, worsening acidosis.
.
Patient was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure.
Given high WBC count in peritoneal fluid concern for peritoneal
infection was high and pt was started on ceftaz.  He remained
hypotensive and on and off dopamine for most of the
hospitilaztion.  Renal sevice followed pt and dialyzed pt with
CCVH while he was hypotensive.  Pt was intubated for respiratory
distress and attempts to wean the went were unsuccessful.  He
underwent Tracheostomy, PEG placement, removal of peritoneal
dialysis catheter and tunnled line for dialysis placement with
surgery.  He was weaned off all pressors.  His respirattory
status was stable and he was finally able to sit up in a chair.
He was noted to be in a wide complex tachycardia on tele.  He
was unresponsive with no pulse and CPR was initiated.  A code
was run and after ~45-50 minutes of unsuccessful efforts to
maintain a pulse of a viable rhythm after discussion with family
code was stopped and pt expired.
