HPI: In brief, this is a 69 year old female with recurrent B
cell
lymphoma (on [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy since [**2119-5-22**]), atrial
fibrillation (on rate control), history of c diff, hx of DVT,
HTN
who presented to the ED with sudden onset of confusion
associated
with left facial droop and left arm weakness.

Per husband they were driving to an oncology appointment and
suddenly she didn't look right and she couldn't tell where a cup
was in space to take a drink. She couldn't stand up out of the
car to get her into the ED. In the ED, attending noted left face
and arm weakness and called a code stroke within 15 minutes of
symptom onset. NIHSS 8 as below for left arm weakness, limb
ataxia, and facial droop.

In the ED, VS 122/82-144/73. Initially taken to head CT that did
not show early evidence of stroke. Patient repeatedly asking for
Dr.[**Name (NI) 14047**] opinion, in addition to motor symptoms she had
decreased sensation over her right arm and was noted to develop
right gaze preference on repeated exams. She had urgent MRI/MRA
head and neck because of a contrast allergy. Labs revealed
platelets of 60 and tPA contraindicated. Case was discussed in
the ED with [**Name (NI) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **], and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and
intervention deferred. Following the MRI which showed right
thalamic stroke, heparin started and placed in IVF with goal BP
~160. She was admitted to the ICU for further management.

NIH Stroke Scale score was 8
1a. Level of Consciousness: 0
1b. LOC Question: 0
1c. LOC Commands: 0
2. Best gaze: 0
3. Visual fields: 0
4. Facial palsy: 1
5a. Motor arm, left: 2
5b. Motor arm, right: 0
6a. Motor leg, left: 0
6b. Motor leg, right: 0
7. Limb Ataxia: 1
8. Sensory: 2
9. Language: 0
10. Dysarthria: 0
11. Extinction and Neglect: 2

On ROS, completed a course of chemotherapy last week. + right
atrial thrombus on echo. Took neupogen shot today.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
1. Diagnosed in [**12/2116**] and received six cycles of R-[**Hospital1 **] with
her last cycle on [**2117-4-19**].
.
2. MVA in [**7-/2117**] with extensive injuries including C2 fracture.
Following recovery, she received one cycle of maintenance
rituximab in 12/[**2116**].
.
3. Follow up PET scan in [**12/2117**] showed worsening adenopathy
with biopsy consistent with her known lymphoma. She received two
cycles of ICE chemotherapy on [**2118-2-22**] and [**2118-3-23**] with
resolution of her FDG-avid adenopathy.
.
4. Received high-dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization and
collections on [**2118-4-22**] followed by an autologous stem cell
transplant on the BEAM regimen starting on [**2118-5-19**]. D 0 was
on [**2118-5-26**].
.
5. Her chemotherapy and posttransplant course were complicated
byproctitis and rectal pain which resolved with recovery of her
counts. She also was noted for lymphocytosis of unclear etiology
felt possibly related to an autoimmune process. She also
developed a drop in her DLCO with concern for pneumonitis. She
was initiated on a prednisone taper with improvement in her
pneumonitis. At the end of [**2118-7-19**], she was noted for
hemolysis with a slight drop in her hematocrit and hemoglobin.
This was fully evaluated and felt related to increasing lipids
with increasing triglycerides seen in the setting of a higher
glucose with her steroid use.
.
6. Restaging CT scan on [**2118-11-1**] showed a new single 21.7 mm
focus of prevascular adenopathy. She underwent CT guided LN
biopsy on [**2118-11-23**] which unfortunately showed recurrence of her
B-cell lymphoma with aggressive features. There was also a small
component of a possible T cell lymphoma noted on one of the
cores. Follow up PET/CT scan on [**2118-12-7**] showed further
progression of her disease with new markedly FDG avid anterior
mediastinal nodal mass compared to previous PET-CT. New
mediastinal (including anterior, precarinal and subcarinal),
right hilar, retrocrural, retroperitoneal and right iliac FDG
avid lymphadenopathy.
.
7. Elected to proceed forward on Protocol #08-064 with treatment
with Pralatrexate and Gemzar. She required periodic admissions
during the course of her treatment. Following 2 cycles of
therapy, repeat PET scan on [**2119-1-30**] showed a 44.6% decrease in
lymph nodes which is considered stable disease. She received 3
and [**11-19**] cycles of therapy with noted disease progression on CT
scan and PET scan.
.
8. [**2119-4-5**]--Admitted for 1st cycle of ESHAP.
.
9. Admitted on [**2119-4-16**] for fever/neutropenia with cough and
probable pneumonia. Treated with Cefpodoxime. Readmitted on
[**2119-4-24**] with cough, weakness, electrolyte abnormalities and
noted C. diff infection, now on oral vancomycin.
.
10. Follow up CT scan showed a mixed response, with interval
decrease of mediastinal lymphadenopathy but increased of
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. It was not clear whether this
was related to her recent infections or progression of lymphoma
particularly as her LDH had increased again. Decision was made
to proceed with treatment with Gemzar/Oxaliplatin which was
initiated on [**2119-5-2**].
.
11. Mrs. [**Known lastname 103705**] underwent a repeat CT torso on [**2119-5-17**], which
demonstrated further progression of her disease, with enlarged
retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  Her counts remained low and she
underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2119-5-18**] which
showed no evidence for lymphoma.  The decision was made to
proceed with a course of [**Hospital1 **] which was initiated on [**2119-5-22**].
.

1. Recurrent NHL.
2. Atrial fibrillation, on Diltiazem, Metoprolol with rate
control. Was on Coumadin which has been on hold with recent
treatment. Digoxin discontinued since early [**1-/2119**] due to
increased dig level and bradycardia.
3. CHF, most recent EF >55% on [**2119-1-26**].

styloid fracture.
12. Prior torn rotator cuff (left) tendon tear (right) arm.
13. Recurrent proctitis
14. Corynebacterium in joint fluid in [**2-/2118**] tx'd w/ Vancomycin.
15. Increased triglycerides/hypercholesterolemia, now on Tricor
