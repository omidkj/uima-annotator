Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
88 year-old Cantonese-speaking woman who presented with
unresponsiveness. The pt does not remember the events of
yesterday, does not know why she is here. The following history
is per EMS, the ED team, and her PCP.

The pt was found next to her bed yesterday morning by a
family friend.  EMS was called shortly thereafter and she was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.  Per the EMS
note, v/s were 88 208/91 20 87%ra. She was given narcan with no
response. She was moving her L arm/leg less than the R.

On presentation to the ER, Code Stroke was called (at 12:23),
but
no time of onset was known.  Therefore protocol was aborted.
The
pt was intubated shortly after directed neurologic examination
over concern for airway protection.

The pt was unable to offer a review of systems.

She was admitted to the ICU. Her course in the ICU has been
unremarkable. She was extubated without difficulty last evening
[**7-31**] at 6pm. She has a UTI and was started on antibiotics (no
cultures). She had one episode of nausea/vomiting today after
she
received cipro on an empty stomach. A central line was placed
but
the patient did not require a drip to sustain her blood
pressure.

Study Findings:
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST:
No fractures or dislocations.  Normal alignment.  Enlarged
osteophytes with impingement upon the foramen transversarium at
the C4 and C5 vertebral bodies in levels.

CTA HEAD & NECK W&W/O CONTRAST & RECON:
No evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Chronic microvascular infarcts. The CTA does not demonstrate any
vessel cut off/filling defect or aneurysm.  There is diffuse
dolichoectasia likely due to long standing hypertension.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
Satisfactory positioning of lines and tubes.  No acute
cardiopulmonary abnormality.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEM:
Right subclavian central venous catheter tip in the lower SVC.
No pneumothorax.

ECG:
Sinus rhythm
Atrial premature complex
Possible left atrial abnormality
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Modest nonspecific lateral ST-T wave changes
No previous tracing available for comparison

EEG:
Results pending

CHEST (PA & LAT):
Pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe.  CT is recommended for
further characterization.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 88 year-old with multiple medical problems admitted
to ICU on [**2136-6-29**] after being found unresponsive at bedside in
her home. She was admitted to ICU and intubated for desats down
to 87%. She was hypertensive with systolics in 220s and placed
on labetelol drip. Head CT revealed chronic microvascular
infarcts but was negative for an acute intracranial hemorrhage
or mass effect. CTA was negative for vessel cut off/filling
defect or aneurysm. These findings suggested toxic-metabolic or
seizure etiology for unresponsiveness. She was started on
dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. She was extubated the evening
after admission and had stable sats on 2L oxygen. On admission
to ICU, patient was arousable only to noxious stimuli by opening
eyes but did not follow commands and unable to move left arm.
Urinalysis was postive for UTI and ciprofloxacin was started.
Patient became hemodynamically stable and remained afebrile with
WBC count within normal limits.

She was transferred to the Stroke service and her neurological
exam had improved. Patient was awake and following commands. She
had decreased strength 4/5 in upper and lower extremities with
[**1-9**] reflexes. EEG showed generalized slowing without focal sharp
waves/spikes consistent with encephalopathy. Dilantin was
discontinued given low likelihood for seizure and her outpatient
medications for hypertension and anxiety were re-started.
Patient had lower extremity edema on exam and echocardiogram was
done to evaluate for congestive heart failure. Echo was negative
for ASD or thrombi, mild LVH, EF 70%, no valvular prolapse.
Patient was started on B12 therapy for low levels.

CXR revealed 7mm lung nodule in left upper lobe concerning for
lung cancer given her history of cancer in [**2131**]. There was also
faint opacity in the right lower lobe consistent with a
developing pneumonia. She was started on broad antibiotic
coverage with flagyl and ciprofloxacin. Brain MRI was done due
to lack of concrete etiology for patient's unresponsiveness for
this admission and past history of stroke. Patient's language
barrier also made it difficult to collect more information. MRI
showed: Chronic right basal ganglia subcortical infarct.
Moderate-to- severe changes of small vessel disease. No definite
evidence of acute infarct. No mass effect. It should be noted
that the examination was performed without gadolinium which
limits evaluation for metastasis or other enhancing mass
lesions. If there is continued suspicion for metastasis,
consider gadolinium-enhanced images.

PT/OT evaluated the patient and was cleared to go home without
rehab services. She was given a choice to receive PT services at
home if she can get health insurance. Patient will followup with
