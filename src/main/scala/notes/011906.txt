Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardiocentesis with drain placement

History of Present Illness:
81 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation, AVNRT
s/p ablation, HOCM with marked diastolic dysfunction, AR, MR,
pulmonary hypertension, RCC s/p nephrectomy presenting w/ 3 days
of lightheadedness and palpitations.  Reportedly bradycardic to
33 in our ED, however, EP interrogated PM and found that this
was not the case.  Shortly after "bradycardic" she was in Afib
w/ [**First Name3 (LF) 5509**] to 133. EP  recommended only PO lopressor.  Recently
discharged on [**8-27**] after placement of pacemaker on both sotalol
80mg and lopressor 50mg. On the advice of PCP and pharmacist,
lopressor dose was halved b/c of concern of being on two
beta-blockers.  Pt has not taken her Sotolol since last night.
Denies chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.
.
However, patient endorses nausea/vomiting/diarrhea following PM
procedure. Unclear if in setting of sotalol versus keflex side
effect after pacer placement. However, in light of HOCM with no
resting gradient, likely that dehydration could have triggered
her afib.

In ED, patient was seen by EP.  As per EP fellow, was in afib on
Thurs night (while feeling bad), then converted to sinus Friday
morning.  Subsequently in afib since Saturday.  Received IV
metoprolol 5mg x1 and PO 25mg Lopressor x1.  Rate note
controlled prior to arriving on floor.  HR 128 in ED.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. she denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Does have
prior TIA.  All of the other review of systems were negative.

[**2126-7-2**]. Echo is recommended. There are small bilateral

wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Diastolic function could not be
assessed. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened b
