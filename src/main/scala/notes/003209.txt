Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
mitral [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mitral [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2171-9-13**]

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 51 year old Cantonese speaking man with history of
rheumatic mitral stenosis, prior pulmonary embolism, and left
atrial clot. He presents today for admission for heparin drip in
preparation of TEE and mitral [**Month/Day/Year **]. Of note, patient
was admitted in [**2171-4-23**] for chest pain, and was found to
be in atrial fibrillation. During that admission, a
transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated rheumatic mitral
stenosis with an ejection fraction of 40-50%. A transesophageal
echocardiogram demonstrated a left atrial appendage, and he was
started on Coumadin. A [**Year (4 digits) **] and cardioversion were
deferred at that time given the finding of the clot.

History done through an interpreter. Since [**Month (only) 547**] admission
patient's symptoms have been stable (not worse or better).
Describes shortness of breath with exertion. Tends to feel dizzy
when he bends over. Denies chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, or syncope.
Patient describes mild nausea, denies abdominal pain or
vomiting. Wife states he had an EGD which demonstrated ulcers
and was started on "medication" for 2 months. Denies black or
bloody stool. Patient aware he is in a hospital for a valve
procedure. He has not taken his warfarin since last saturday
night.

MITRAL [**Month/Day/Year **]/CARDIAC CATH [**2171-9-13**]:
1. Severe mitral stenosis with mean gradient of 15mmHg and area
of 0.68cm2.
2. Successful transeptal puncture with intracardiac echo
guidance.
3. Successful mitral [**Month/Day/Year **] using Inoue balloon inflated
to a maximum diameter of 30mm.

POST-PROCEDURE ECHOS:

TTE [**2171-9-13**] at 12:45:00 PM:  Study immediately post balloon
mitral [**Year (4 digits) **]. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate valvular
mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-4-29**], the
MVA area is greater and the mean mitral gradient has decreased.
There is now moderate mitral regurgitation.

TEE [**2171-9-13**] at 2:40:05 PM: The left atrium is dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast and a layering
thrombus is present in the left atrial appendage. There is
organizinf thrombus in the LAA situated deep within the
structure and away from the mouth of the structure, measuring
2.2x 2.1cm in maximal diameter. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrium is
dilated. The right atrial appendage ejection velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets that are
moderately thickened. The left and right leaflet appears fused
but frank aortic stenosis ids not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened and shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is
at least moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2).
There is no chordal deformation/thickening. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2171-5-3**], the left atrial appendage
thrombus is consdierably smaller, not as mobile, and situated
away from the mouth of the atrial appendage.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2171-9-13**]:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed a mean mitral valve gradient of
15mmHg
and estimated valve area of 0.68cm2.
2. Successful transeptal puncture and mitral [**Month/Day/Year **] using
a an
Inoue balloon inflated to 26mm, 28mm and 30mm diameter.
3. Improvement of mean gradient to 6mmHG and valve area to
1.98cm2.
Patient left cathlab in stable condition.

CXR [**2171-9-14**]: Moderate-to-marked cardiomegaly is stable. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is no overt
CHF. There are bibasilar atelectases.

ULTRASOUND [**2171-9-15**]: No evidence of bilateral groin hematoma,
fluid collections or vascular abnormalities in the common
femoral vessels.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mitral Stenosis secondary to Rheumatic disease: Mitral
[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2171-10-14**]. Intra-procedure SBPs 70s-110 and required
doputamine support. Post-procedure SBP 70s and was transferred
to CCU for observation. Hypotension differential included
tamponode vs. bleed (RP or groin). ECHO X 2 negative for
tamponode or effusion. Groin sites intact and CT ab/pelvis
negative for bleed. Most likely related to procedure medications
and new onset MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was stable in unit and transferred
back to the floor on [**2171-10-15**]. On [**2171-10-16**] patient developed
hematoma at R cath site, heparin was continued but coumadin was
held. Blood pressure and HCT were stable, ultrasound imaging on
[**2171-10-16**] was negative for hematoma b/l. Patient developed
mild-moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Patient's SBP averaged 100s
and felt too low to start afterload reducer inpatient. Consider
outpatient afterload reducer if BP tolerates. Follow-up ECHO in
[**2-24**] weeks.

Rhythm: Atrial fibrillation. No RVR during entire admission,
heart rate < 100. TEE demonstrated persistant left atrial
thrombus, though smaller and less mobile since [**2171-5-3**] TEE.
Unable to convert due to thrombus. Continued Metoprolol Tartrate
50 mg PO BID for rate control during admission, discharged on
Toprol XL 100 mg.

Anti-coagulation: Required for 1) L atrial thrombus 2) History
of PE 3) A Fib. On weight-based heparin drip throughout
admission. Restarted Coumadin 4 mg qhs during admission,
discharged on Lovonex until therapeutic.

Mild Nausea: Patient reported mild nausea on admission. No
abnormalities on CT abdomen or pelvis. All stools guaiac
negative. Started and discharged on Omeprazole 20 mg qd. H.
pylori POSITIVE, pending at d
