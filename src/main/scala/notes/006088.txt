History of Present Illness:
83F with chronic systolic CHF (EF 40%), transferred from [**Hospital 8125**]
Hospital for further management of rapid atrial fibrillation and
acute on chronic systolic CHF. She states that she had been
feeling weak for several weeks prior to her admission there at
[**Hospital3 6592**], with several adjustments to her medications by
her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was initially stopped on hydrochlorthiazide about a
month prior to hospitalization due to rash, and then started on
bumex. This was later increased to 1mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-8**]. It
was stopped on [**11-28**] due to thinking that this was
contributing to her weakness, but she felt no better with
discontinuation and was admitted to [**Hospital1 **].
.
During this time, she also felt progressively worsening
shortness of breath that was exacerbated by movement. She also
experienced increasing orthopnea as well as increased swelling
of her hands and feet over the same period. She had been started
on the bumex due to some of this swelling occuring prior to her
feeling weak, but this has worsened markedly.
.
On admission to [**Hospital3 6592**], Admission EKG showed sinus
rhythm without ischemic changes. Serial cardiac biomarkers were
negative. Admission BNP 6929. CXR showed increased interstitial
markings but no infiltrate, and small L>R pleural effusions. TTE
shwoed normal LV size, septal wall hypertrophy, LVEF 60-65%, 3+
MR, and mildly elevated PA pressures. She was also found to have
a UTI, and was treate for citrobacter koseri UTI with
levofloxacin. She does note that 1 week prior to her admission
she had an episode of chills, although no frank fevers. On
admission she had a significant elevation in her WBC count to
14k with 15% bands. Her hospital course complicated by [**Hospital3 **] with
RVR (as high as 160 bpm) on HD#2 which was treated with
diltiazem IV which initially converted back to sinus rhythm. Had
a rash to HCTZ and was diuresed with ethacrynic acid/ She was
also swabbed for H1N1 which came back negative. She continued to
revert back to [**Hospital3 **] with RVR and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Review of symptoms: Denies chest pain, palpitations, melena,
brbpr. No pleurisy. She did go on a bus ride prior to her
feeling poorly of ~1hr duration. Had some nausea prior to
admission but none since. Reports dysgusia and lack of appetite.
Unclear about any weight gain or loss.

STUDIES:
.
RUQ US [**2129-12-7**]
1. Cholelithiasis, but no evidence of cholecystitis or bile duct
dilation.
2. Soft tissue structure in the portal hilum, possibly an
enlarged lymph
node, of uncertain etiology and significance. This finding could
be further evaluated by CT as clinically indicated.
3. Right pleural effusion.
.
LENI Low Ext [**2129-12-8**]
Possible deep vein thrombosis in one of the two posterior tibial

veins of the right calf. This vein demonstrates normal
compression, but no
vascular flow could be identified. This may represent old clot.
No acute DVT is seen on today's exam. No deep vein thrombosis
seen in the remainder of the veins of both legs. Recommend
repeat US in several days to re-evaluate the right leg.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2129-12-8**]
1. Extensive lymphadenopathy seen in the bilateral axillary
regions, within the mediastinum, bihilar regions, and the
retroperitoneum, and bilaterally within the inguinal regions,
which is highly suggestive of a
lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma. The spleen and
liver are not enlarged.
2. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions.
3. Multiple bilateral tiny pulmonary nodules. In the setting of
a diffuse
proliferative disorder this could represent malignant disease,
but this
appearance is uncommon in lymphoma. These nodules should be
followed up with a repeat CT Thorax in three months.
4. Gallstone within the gallbladder, without overt evidence of
acute
cholecystitis. If however there is concern for the presence of
acute
cholecytitis based on clinical factors, a repeat ultrasound
could be
considered, given suboptimal visualization of the gallbladder
noted on the
prior study.
5. Left-sided inguinal hernia which contains fluid and fat only.

.
TTE [**2129-12-6**]
IMPRESSION: Mild leaflet thickening with likely torn chordae and
eccentric jet of at least moderate mitral regurgitation. Normal
left ventricular cavity size with preserved global and regional
systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Dilated ascending
aorta.
.
CAROTID [**2129-12-20**]
There is no evidence of significant stenosis within the carotid
arteries
bilaterally.
.
CXR [**2129-12-5**]
Bilateral pleural effusions are small on the right side and
small to moderately large on the left side. The lungs are
slightly hyperinflated, which could be due to COPD, no
consolidation. Heart size is top normal.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral
