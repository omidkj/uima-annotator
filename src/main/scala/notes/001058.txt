HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
African-American female with a history of end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, peripheral vascular
disease, status post bilateral AKAs, diabetes type 2, CVA,
coronary artery disease, status post CABG and mitral valve
repair, history of DVT and PE, COPD, who presents from
outpatient hemodialysis with increasing lethargy.  At
baseline, the patient is responsive and interactive verbally.
On admission, the patient was only responsive to sternal rub.
At hemodialysis, the temperature was 99.8, pulse 130-140, 02
saturation 85% on room air which went up to 100% on a
nonrebreather; 2 kilograms of fluid were removed at
hemodialysis over two hours and then the patient was sent to
the Emergency Room.

The initial vital signs were a temperature of 99.8, blood
pressure 100/53, heart rate 120, respirations 30, saturating
99% on a nonrebreather.  The initial physical examination was
positive for abdominal tenderness.  The patient was sent for
an abdominal CT which showed extensive atherosclerotic
changes involving all of the abdominal vasculature and
possible thickening of the small bowel walls.  Mesenteric
ischemic could be excluded.  No evidence of obstruction.  No
perforation or abscess.

General Surgery were consulted but no operative intervention
was deemed necessary at that time.  The patient continued to
have a blood pressure systolic 80s to 100s, responsive to 2
liters of normal saline.  The patient's chest x-ray also
showed evolving bilateral opacities and the patient was
treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.

The patient was weaned off the nonrebreather to 4 liters
nasal cannula. CTA was done to rule out PE given the
patient's hypoxia, hypertension, and tachycardia.  The study
was negative for PE but did show new ground glass opacities
at the right lung base suspicious for aspiration pneumonitis.
There was also chronic consolidation of the left lung base
and radiation changes of the right hemithorax which were
stable.

The patient was transferred initially to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further management.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient had diarrhea for the past
week.  No nausea, vomiting, no change in her chronic
abdominal pain.  No change in her chronic cough.  No fevers,
chills, dysphagia.  The patient is anuric at baseline.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a Jehovah's witness and does
not accept blood products.  She has a 60 pack year smoking
history.  No history of alcohol.  She lives with her son in a
handicapped apartment.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for hypertension and diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
99.8, heart rate 88, blood pressure 86/42, respirations 19,
saturating 100% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  General:  The
patient is somnolent and arousable to sternal rub, unable to
follow commands.  More verbal when family is around.  No
clear communication.  HEENT:  The patient is anicteric.  The
oropharynx is dry.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs.  Lungs:  Diffuse rhonchi bilaterally.  Decreased
breath sounds, left greater than right base.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, Guaiac
negative.  Extremities:  Status post bilateral AKA right
upper extremity, slightly more edematous than her left upper
extremity, 1+ pitting edema.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Head CT showed multiple old
infarct including occipital infarct bilaterally as well as
lacunar infarct in the right thalamus and left putamen which
appear unchanged compared to [**2196-3-1**].  There is a new
infarct in the left side of the pons, unable to comment on
exact timing.  No mass affect.  No hemorrhage.

CT of the abdomen showed question of possible small bowel
thickening, mesenteric ischemia could not be excluded.  No
obstruction, no perforation, no abscess.

CT angiogram showed no PE, new ground glass patchy opacities
at the right lung base suspicious for aspiration pneumonitis,
chronic left lung base consolidation and radiation treatments
to the right hemithorax.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed no intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, small amount of
pericholecystic fluid but no gallbladder wall edema, several
small gallstones.  No biliary obstruction.

Cardiac echocardiogram showed mild left atrial dilation,
symmetric LVH, moderate global LV hypokinesis, moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 1+ MR, 2+ TR,
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, significant
pulmonary regurgitation, trivial pericardial effusions.
Ejection fraction of 30%, TR gradient 34.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  The patient was found to have
gram-negative rod bacteremia with Stenotrophomonas and
Enterobacter, likely from gut translocation from her acute on
chronic mesenteric ischemia.  The patient also had evidence
of an aspiration pneumonia.  The patient was treated with
Levaquin and Flagyl, a total course of 14 days as well as an
initial five day course of gentamicin.  During this time, the
patient's right-sided Hickman was kept in place per renal.
The patient subsequently had 48 hours worth of negative blood
cultures.

2.  HYPOTENSION:  Secondary to sepsis from gram-negative rod
bacteremia, plus/minus pneumonia.  The patient was treated
with normal saline boluses as well as transient use of
dopamine.  The patient's blood pressure eventually stabilized
to the 120s systolic; however, her antihypertensives were
never reintroduced secondary to hypotension after
hemodialysis.  As of discharge, the patient is still not on
home antihypertensive medications.

3.  HYPOXIA:  Secondary to sepsis and aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was treated with antibiotics for the above and
quickly weaned off her 02 requirement.

4.  MIXED ACID BASE DISORDER:  Initially, the patient came in
with nongap metabolic alkalosis as well as respiratory
alkalosis.  These all resolved as the patient's sepsis
improved.

5.  NEUROLOGIC STATUS:  The patient's mental status improved
with treatment of sepsis.

6.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE:  The patient continued to
receive dialysis through her right subclavian Hickman.  This
was never removed despite the patient's bacteremia.  The
patient's most recent dialysis before discharge was on
[**2196-8-5**].  She was able to tolerate ultrafiltration; however,
no fluid was able to be removed secondary to hypotension down
to the 80s-90s systolic.

7.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient is known to have bad
diffuse atherosclerosis, likely has chronic mesenteric
ischemia.  MRA of the abdomen was unable to be performed
since the patient did not have any access to receive the MRI
contrast dye.  Given the low likelihood that any surgical or
angioplastic interventions would be likely in this patient
given all of her comorbidities,
