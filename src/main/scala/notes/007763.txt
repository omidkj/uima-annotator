History of Present Illness:
78 y/o female with PMH significant for hypertension, venous
stasis disease, and MRSA wound infection in [**2097**] admitted on
[**10-27**] with confusion. Pt was found on the morning of amdmission
by her neighbor with altered mental status and urinary
incontinence. Pt was taken to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further
evaluation. In the office, the pt was having word finding
difficulties but per report was not confused. She was also noted

for a WBC count of 34.2 with 18% bands. CXR showed a
questionable right middle lobe infiltrate. Pt was initiated on
the sepsis protocol. She received vancomycin 1 gm x1,
levofloxacin 500 mg IV x1, tylenol, and ativan. Pt was then
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the pt was continued on vancomycin for sepsis from
a left lower extremity cellulitis. Her blood pressure remained
stable. Pt was then transferred to the floor for further care.

In further discussion, pt denies fevers and chills at home. No
CP or SOB. No abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting at home. Pt
denies diarrhea. No dysuria or hematuria.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2101-10-26**] 6:59 PM:
The tip of the right jugular IV catheter is identified in the
distal SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. There is improvement
of the aeration of both lungs. The heart is top normal in size.
There is continued tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.

MR ANKLE W&W/O CONTRAST LEFT  [**2101-10-28**] 1:56 PM
Reason: ?osteo
COMPARISON: None.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of osteomyelitis.
Diffuse fatty atrphy of the imaged muscle groups. This finding
can be seen in denervation injury.
Skin thickening in the calf with signal characteristics
suggestive of fibrosis, likely chronic.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2101-10-29**] 9:12 AM
Reason: eval for infiltrate
IMPRESSION:
Mild right basilar atelectasis. Support lines as described.

ECHO [**2101-11-1**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the
basal septum. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation
is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 y/o female with PMH significant for hypertension, venous
stasis disease, and MRSA wound infection in [**2097**] admitted on
[**10-27**] with confusion. She was found to have spesis most probably
due to a left lower extremity ulcer and cellulitis.

1. [**Name (NI) 15305**] Pt was treated per the sepsis protocol in the ICU and
is now stable. Was most probably due to her left LE ulcer and
cellulitis. No other signs of infection-- clean urine culture,
no PNA on CXR, no signs of an abdominal process, no evidence of
CNS infection. Blood cultures grew 1:4 bottles of coag negative
staph, although this likely represented a contaminant. Normal
[**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. The patient's lower extremity ulcer
and cellulitis improved with vancomycin, and she will be
discharged to complete a 14 day course. Wound care nurses and
the plastic surgery service followed the patient closely while
she was in-house. The patient will follow-up with vascular
surgery and plastic surgery as an outpatient.

2. Mental status changes- Completely resolved by the time of
transfer to the floor. Most likely secondary to infection.

3. [**Name (NI) 12329**] Pt's antihypertensives held in the ICU in setting of
sepsis. She was mildly hypertensive at the time of transfer to
the floor. Pt was restarted on her home antihypertenisve regimen
with improvement in her blood pressure control.

4. Restrictive airway disease- The patient's oxygen saturation
was stable throughout hospital course. She was started on
standing Atrovent nebs q6h and Advair as well as albuterol prn.
PFTs may be considered as an outpatient

5. Code status- DNR/DNI.
