Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 42 yo W with PMH of COPD on home O2, OSA, pulm HTN and
prior PE who presented to ED with complaint of SOB and
productive cough with brown sputum. Cough worsening over last
few weeks. Also with chest tightness. Feels like "sucking air
through a straw." Spoke to primary care provider over phone and
was started on prednisone taper 2 weeks ago (can't recall dose,
10mg pred to start?). Symptoms persisted so pt was started on
azithromycin x 3 days ago by her PCP without improvement in
symptoms. On O2 at home, but increased requirements. Per pt,
O2sat normally 92-94% on 4L.
.
In the ED, VS: T99.6 BP 142/78 RR 28-36, 89O2 sat on RA. 92% on
NRB. She was tachypneic on exam. CXR with infiltrate vs soft
tissue, limited study. Received ceftriaxone 1g and levaquin
750mg IV x1. She received solumedrol 125mg IV x1 and nebs. EKG
with sinus tach at 104, TWI in V1,V2. D dimer was sent for
concern of possible PE as pt was unable to undergo CTA PE due to
size.
.
ROS: + knee pain

REPORTS:
CXR
FINDINGS: Single bedside upright radiograph of the chest is
notable for low lung volumes bilaterally. There is marked
cardiomegaly. The diaphragms are not optimally seen, presumably
related to confluence of overlying soft tissue, patient motion,
and possible pulmonary opacities which are not excluded on this
study and must be placed in clinical context. Possible right
lower lobe consolidation.

LENIs
IMPRESSION: Limited study with incomplete evaluation of the
proximal left
superficial femoral vein, otherwise, no evidence of DVT.

Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Significant aortic stenosis cannot be fully excluded. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2113-8-9**], symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
is more prominent and right ventricular enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis is now apparent. The aortic root is also now
dilated and moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary
artery systolic pressure are now present.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 y.o. F with PMH of COPD, OSA, morbid obesity here with
SOB/cough and increasing O2 requirement.

1. Shortness of breath:  Worsening over past several weeks. No
improvement on low dose prednisone taper. Had not been using
inhalers as regularly as PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2875**]. Possible infiltrate on
CXR so the patient completed levofloxacin x 5 days.  Also, PE
was considered given that she had a history in the past.
D-dimer was borderline elevated and had sinus tachycardia on
admission.  However, due to body habitus, CTA could not be
obtained.  LENIs were negative bilaterally. Given these
findings, she was empirically started on heparin gtt and
continues on this with coumadin bridge (currently, 10 mg / day).
INR 1.3 on discharge.  She will need to have INR checked daily.
INR goal [**2-10**] and will need this for 6 months.  Primarily, it was
felt that her shortness of breath is likely due to her morbid
obesity, causing obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.  The patient
was maintained on 6 L NC while awake and on autoset Bipap when
sleeping.  With this regimen, her O2 sats ranged between 89-95%.
Her goal O2 sat should be from 88-93%.  There was one incidence
of hypercarbic respiratory failure that was due to malfunction
of her machine.  She was rapidly corrected once her Bipap
machine was functioning properly. Albuterol and ipratropium
inhalers were given for reactive airway disease.

2. Pulmonary Hypertension: Likely secondary to obesity
hypoventilation syndrome, OSA.  Maintained on O2 and Bipap as
noted above.

FEN: Heart Healthy low Na diet when tolerated.
Ppx: Coumadin, heparin gtt no PPI indicated

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to difficulty breathing.
You were found to have sleep apnea and low oxygen levels during
the day. You were treated with oxygen and a BIPAP mask. You will
be going to rehab in order to increase your strength and become
more comfortable with the BIPAP. You were also started on
medication to thin your blood in case you have a blood
