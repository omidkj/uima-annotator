Allergies:
Lopid

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5295**]
Chief Complaint:
Substernal chest pressure, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who was in her usual state
of health, living independently with a history of DM, HTN, CAD,
HL, and CRI who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2176-6-5**] after transfer
from [**Hospital3 628**] after experiencing susbternal chest pain,
shortness of breath, and weakness which caused her to collapse.
EMS found her to be at 55% O2 saturation which improved when
placed on a 100% non-rebreather mask and given sublingual
nitroglycerin and placed on a nitro drip. The patient was
reported to have elevated CKs and Troponins at the outside
hospital with an EKG showing an old LBBB at a rate of [**Street Address(2) 34511**] changes that did not ischemic criteria. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cardiac catheterization and
further evaluation. On the telemetry floor at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient
developed new onset shortness of breath and the suspicion
remained of an ischemic cause. Her troponin on [**2176-6-6**] was 0.41,
0.57, MB of 10, 24, and CPK of 156, 283. Her EKG showed no acute
changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiac -
Rhythm: Pt. was transferred to CCU where she remained in sinus
rhythm with occasional premature atrial contractions.
Pump: An echocardiogram on [**2176-6-7**] showed her to have diastolic
dysfunction with an EF of 50% with mild global LV hypokinesis,
[**12-15**]+ moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation,
and mild pulmonary hypertension. Her CHF was treated with
aggressive diuresis with Lasix with a goal of maintaing her net
negative by 1-1.5 L as her renal function tolerated. A nitro
drip was continued for symptomatic relief and decreased preload.
She was initially started on Captopril 6.25 mg TID which was
later D/C'd on [**2176-6-8**] secondary to renal dysfunction. She would
then occasionally desaturate to the high 80's, low 90s O2 sat
with improvement on lasix, aggressive pulmonary toilet, and
albuterol nebs. She was placed on Natrecor .01 on [**2176-6-8**] which
was quickly discontinued secondary to an episode of hypotension.
The nitro drip was converted to isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg TID
on [**2176-6-12**] which was later changed to Imdur 60 mg PO QD. Repeat
chest xrays showed significant improvement with her pulmonary
edema with the last on [**2176-6-13**] showed small residual pleural
effusion on the right. Hydralazine 10 mg QID was started briefly
and changed to Norvasc 5 mg PO QD for blood pressure control.
CAD: s/p NSTEMI. The plan for intervention vs. medical
management was discussed with the family as well as the
risk/benefits. They decided to pursue medical management. The
patient was continued on a heparin drip which was D/C'd on
[**2176-6-9**]. She was continued on Plavix, a statin, ASA, and a
beta-blocker. On [**2176-6-11**], sagging ST segments were noted on EKG
inferiorly and her peak CPK was 515, MBI 2, and Troponin 1.37.
The patient experienced mild chest pain on the morning of
[**2176-6-12**] which was relieved with morphine. Cardiac enzymes
continued to trend down and the patient remained asymptomatic.
2. Pulmonary - Presented with pulmonary edema which resolved
with aggressive diuresis. Question of residual pleural
infiltrate/effusion on right on chest xray and assymmetric lung
exam so was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg PO Q48 on [**2176-6-11**] for
a 7 day course to cover for possible pneumonia. The patient
developed a cough and had a Tmax of 100.6. Legionella antigen
proved negative. She was able to wean finally on [**2176-6-13**] off the
cool O2 nebulizer to 6L nasal cannula and then to 3 L NC without
difficulty.
3. DM - The patient was continued on a sliding scale insulin and
diabetic diet.
4. GI - The patient experienced a few episodes of black tarry
stool and was intermittently noted to have guaiac postive
stools. It was felt that once her acute cardiac issues were
resolved and her GI bleed continued, the plan would be discussed
with the family to ensure that the patient's wishes were
respected in terms of aggressive vs.
5. Heme - The patient's hematocrit dropped once to 26 for which
she received 1 unit of PRBC and has remained stable since.

The patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 1036**] on [**2176-6-14**] in good
condition with resolution of her pulmonary edema, decreased
cardiac enzymes, and increased mobility and po intake.
