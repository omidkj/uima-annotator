Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6378**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, cough and fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 y/o F with PMH of severe COPD (on 3L O2 at
home), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and prior small cell
lung cancer s/p chemotherapy and radiation who presented to the
ED on [**7-3**] with increased fatigued, somnolence and
non-productive cough.  Patient reports that on [**7-1**] she started
feeling extremely fatigued to the point that she did not want to
eat anything and just wanted to sleep. At the same time she had
noticed increasing O2 requirement and had non-productive cough.
She continued to feel the same for two days and was brought to
the ED by husband for further evaluation.  Of note, she was
recently seen as an outpatient ([**2183-6-24**]) for a COPD
exacerbation which improved with prednisone which has since been
tapered. She denied any chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea,
PND.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient was triggered for O2 sat of
80% on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] irregularly irregular HR of 149 with RVR, and a
fever of 101.2. A WBC was 14.7, lactate of 2.3 and Cr 1.1
(baseline 0.8-0.9). A CTA was performed that did not show
pulmonary emboli or any specific infiltrates, but did reveal
stable right sided loculated pleural effusion. Started on
vancomycin and levaquin in ED due to fever and hypoxia as there
was concern for pulmonary source. Given tylenol and 3L of fluids
and sent to the MICU.
.
In the MICU she was transitioned to Azithromycin, and other
antibiotics stopped. She was slowly tapered on oxygen. It was
felt that the sudden weather heat wave, and a bout of bronchitis
had triggered a severe COPD exacerbation. She was called out to
the general medical floor within 2 days where she continued to
steadily recuperate until time of her discharge [**Last Name (un) **] on [**2183-7-10**].

CTA:  [**2183-7-3**]
Impression: Stable appearance of right para-hilar density and
loculated effusion. Chest radiograph findings explained by
likely post-radiation changes. No pulmonary embolism.

EKG [**7-6**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
and ventricular premature beats. Right bundle-branch block.
Possible anterior myocardial infarction,age indeterminate.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-7-3**] ventricular rate is
slower. Premature ventricular contractions are new.
.
CXR [**7-7**]: The somewhat heterogeneous opacification of both lungs
which had progressed from [**7-3**] to [**7-6**] is now more
confluent, and accompanied by new small fissural left pleural
effusion, almost likely due to cardiac decompensation,although
heart size is only mildly increased. Moderate right pleural
effusion, the larger is a chronic finding, as is enlargement of
the right hilus and thickening of the apical and mediastinal
pleural surfaces.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 73 year old female with PMH of severe
COPD (on 3L O2 at home), longstanding atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, and prior small cell lung s/p chemo and radiation who
presented to the ED on [**7-3**] with increased fatigued, somnolence
and non-productive cough for two days. Patient has serious COPD
flare felt to be from recent URI/bronchitis in conjunction with
recent humid weather changes and some additional atrial
fibrillation with RVR early in her hospitalization necessitating
a brief ICU stay before she was stable for the general medicine
wards and patient discharged to home on [**7-10**] with close PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**]. Please see below for more detailed hospital course.

# Dyspnea: The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with dyspnea,
fatigue and increased non-productive cough x2 days most likely
from acute bronchitis or a viral syndrome. Since patient was
recently tapered from prednisone in the outpatient setting for
what was felt to be a milder COPD exacerbation her rebound
increased SOB and increased O2 requirement was again felt to be
related to a COPD flare/exacerbation in the setting of acute
infection. Other contributing factors to patient SOB include
history of OSA, lung cancer, and some milder element of
pulmonary fibrosis from radiation therapy in the past with
resultant poor pulmonary functional reserve. She also has
presence of loculated stable pleural effusions which are chronic
in nature. Negative CTA ruled out PE and lack of consolidation
ruled out pneumonia. The CTA showed stable right sided pleural
effusion unchanged from the previous Chest CT Scans in [**Hospital1 18**]
records. Dyspnea less likely to be cardiac in origin given no
chest pain and negative cardiac enzymes. She received 1 dose of
levofloxacin for CAP coverage, but it was changed to
azithromycin as the patient reported mental status changes on
levofloxacin. Patient reported having home 02 sat levels most
commonly in the mid to high 80s with minimal exertion which was
an important baseline detail for her ongoing management as
patient clearly retains chronic Co2 levels with severe COPD
status. She completed her Azithromycin for COPD exacerbation
while inpatient and was placed on an additional 3 days of
prednisone taper for 3 more days after her discharge to complete
a pulse taper. She was also given albuterol nebs and ipratropium
nebs inpatient and continued on continuous O2 therapy with goal
to keep O2 in the high 80s to low 90s on 3-5L NC. Blood cultures
remained unremarkable and sputum was unrevealing as it showed
just e/o commensal respiratory flora. She was breathing at her
usual baseline at time of discharge and she refused any home VNA
