Chief Complaint:
hypoxia after IP tumor debridement


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy; tumor debridement


History of Present Illness:
57 yo F with h/o renal cell carcinoma dx in [**2150**], s/p
nephrectomy/adrenalectomy. CT scan [**2153**] showed recurrence with
lung mets. s/p bronchoscopy with destruction of endobronchial
tumor [**8-/2157**] and again today. Mets were in proximal left
mainstem and in bronchus intermedius. Has had multiple chemo
regimens. Currently on gemcitibine/sunitinib. Next dose will be
Monday.
.
Over the past two days has been having pink tinged sputum.
Today, she had rigid bronchoscopy, with flex bronch. Did
cryptherapy to left mainstem and bronchus intermedius tumors.
Also did electrocautery and destruction with foreceps. Moderate
bleeding controlled with electrocautery. Left mainstem
completely open. On right side, endobronchial tumor was diffuse,
could not be opened 100%. Subsequently developed tachypnea.
Post-procedure, x-ray showed complete collapse of RML/RLL.
Likely plugged bronchus intermedius with blood clot afterward.
Now on bipap, with clinical improvement. Plan is to get x-ray on
bipap to see how it looks. Getting decadron 4 mg Q8H due to
possibility of airway edema in bronchus intermedius.
.
ROS + for sputum/hemoptysis, nausea, constipation.  Denies HA
currently.  Denies Fever, chills, abd pain, SOB, CP,
palpitations, rash

STUDIES:
[**2158-8-10**] Chest x-ray: Pending at discharge; mild improvement from
prior.

[**2158-8-9**] Chest x-ray: IMPRESSION: Collapse of the right lower and
middle lobes.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo F with h/o renal cell carcinoma dx in [**2150**], s/p
nephrectomy/adrenalectomy, s/p bronchoscopy with destruction of
endobronchial tumor [**8-/2157**] and again today. This was complicated
by complete collapse of the right m/r lower lobes.

# Right M/L lobe whiteout: Due to right middle and lower lobe
collapse s/p rigid bronchoscopy and tumore debridement. Patient
did not show any improvement on CXR with acapella. Overnight she
clinically improved with bipap and was on RA breathing 14 and
satting 98%. She was comfortable at the time of discharge. Most
likely process was plugging secondary to manipulation and clot
formation. Resolved with non-invasive ventilation and was
discharged with follow-up in one month.

#Decreased urine output: She required a small amount of fluid
overnight in the ICU to support her UOP post-procedurally.
Resolved at discharge.

# h/o migraines: Chronic. Patient has active migraine on
admission. Received Sumatriptan x 1 with improvement.

#RCC s/p nephrectomy with diffuse lung mets: Chronic. S/P rigid
bronch with cryotherapy and debridement with lobe collapse and
improvement with NIV as above.  Sutent held while in hospital
overnight.

#Hypothyroidism: Chronic. Continued levothyroxine.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 38472**],

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. You had a rigid
bronchoscopy (procedure to look in your lungs) with cryptherapy
and electrocautery to help open your airways and improve your
breathing. After the procedure you had shortness of breath and
likely had a blockage of your airway from a mucous plug or blood
clot. You were admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation
(breathing mask) and respiratory monitoring. Your breathing
improved tremendously overnight and your x-ray showed
improvement. You also received steroids after the procedure,
which were subsequently stopped.

The Interventional Pulmonology team was very involved in your
care, and felt that your breathing was greatly improved and you
were safe for discharge, with follow-up in clinic in one month
with a CT scan of your airways.

We did not change any of your medications.

Please follow-up at your appointments below.
