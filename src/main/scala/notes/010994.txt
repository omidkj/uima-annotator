Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30062**]
Chief Complaint:
melana, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with CAD s/p CABG, atrial fib on coumadin, s/p
VT/VF arrest with BiV pacer; CHF with EF 15% admitted to the
MICU ([**9-7**]) after presenting with CP, SOB, abdominal pain,
melena, INR of 3, and Hct drop from 40 to 37. He was admitted to
the MICU where he was given FFP and 1u PRBCs and ruled out for
ACS. He was seen by GI, Surgery, and Cardiology. GI c/s resulted
in plan for EGD. Surgery c/s resulted in INR reversal and serial
exams and hcts. Cardiology felt the patient's CP was not [**2-13**] a
cardiac etiology. He was ruled out for MI regardless. His Hct
was 31 at its lowest but remained stable and, as he was stable
overall, he was felt appropriate for transfer to the floor for
further work up of his melena.
.
Of note, last [**Month (only) 547**], the patient had a similar presentation and
EGD, c-scope, and capsule endoscopy demonstrated gastritis,
Barrett's, diverticulosis and grade 1 hemorrhoids were found,
without any active bleeding.
At time of transfer, the patient endorsed mild abdominal pain
and diaphoresis. He denied chest pain. He had not had a BM in 2
days.

EKG - [**9-7**]: Ventricular paced rhythm
Atrial mechanism uncertain - may be paced ot possible ectopic
atrial rhythm
Since previous tracing of [**2140-4-19**], ventricular ectopy absent and
P wave
morphology appears changed

CXR - [**9-7**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The
cardiomediastinal contour is
unchanged, with moderate cardiomegaly. There is no pleural
effusion or
evidence of focal consolidation. The dual-lead pacing device is
unchanged in appearance. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No significant change since [**2140-4-12**]. No evidence
of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.

KUB - [**9-9**]: FINDINGS: There is non-specific bowel gas in the
abdomen. There are no distended loops of bowel, or concerning
air-fluid levels. There is air in the rectum. There is a large
amount of feces in the descending colon, suggesting
constipation. Of note, there is a right hip hemiarthroplasty
hardware, without apparent hardware complication. There is a
mild lumbar levoscoliosis. There are surgical clips at the right
upper quadrant, from prior cholecystectomy. There are wires
projected on to the heart, likely pacer wires.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction. Likely
constipation.

EGD - [**9-9**]: Barrett's Exophagitis, Gastritis, Duodenitis


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old male with CAD s/p CABG, atrial fib on coumadin, s/p
VT/VF arrest now with BiV pacer; CHF with EF 15% who presented
with what appears to be non-cardiac chest pain, abdominal pain
and melena.
.
# Melena/Abdominal pain:  HCT decreased to 31 from BL of 33 on
arrival to MICU. INR was reversed. Serial hematocrits were
checked and remained stable despite the patient remaining guiac
positive. Aspirin and Coumadin were held until after EGD at
which time they were restarted. IV PPI was given until EGD.
Patient was converted to PO PPI [**Hospital1 **] and instructed to continue
as such for six weeks. GI follow up [**Hospital1 1988**]. Patient had
similar episode in [**4-19**] and had an extensive GI workup which was
negative.
.
# Chest Pain:  Pain resolved by the time the patient arrived to
the floor. Cardiology felt the pain was unlikely to be cardiac
in nature as cardiac enzymes were negative on arrival to the ED
after 5 hours of constant chest pain.  Pain could be esophageal
as patient has history of Esophagitis and Barretts esophagus.
Last possibility is aortic chest pain as patient has history of
thoracic aortic aneurysm repair, small concern for dissection
although unlikely as patient remained stable throughout his
hopitalization and his CP resolved.
.
# CAD:  Patient is s/p CABG.  Chest pain unlikely to be cardiac.
MI ruled out. ASA, BB and statin were initially held in setting
of possible GIB but were restarted prior to discharge.
.
# CHF:  Patient with history of ischemic CMP with EF 15%.  Home
Lasix, Aldactone, and Toprol were intially held but reintroduced
prior to discharge. Home digoxin was continued.
.
# PAF: Patient s/p BiV pacer placement on Coumadin. INR was
reversed intially but coumadin was restarted prior to discharge.
Digoxin was continued.
.
# VF/VT arrest:  Patient is s/p BiV pacer/ICD  placement. Home
Sotalol, Mexiletine were continued.
.
# Asthma:  Albuterol MDI at home. Albuterol Nebs were given PRN.
.
# Hypothyroidism:  Home levoxyl was continued.
.
# CKD:  Patient with Cr of 1.7 on admission w
