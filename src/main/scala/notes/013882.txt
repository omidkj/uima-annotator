Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 598**]
Chief Complaint:
free air on CT abdomen, transfer from OSH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Diagnostic laparoscopy.
2. Exploratory laparotomy.
3. Sigmoid resection with an end left colostomy.


History of Present Illness:
87 M admitted to OSH [**7-15**] s/p fall from chair incidentally found
to have free air on imaging, now transferred for further
management.  The patient suffered a mechanical fall from his
rocking chair and in the OSH ED was found to have an elevated
CPK
and he was admitted for IV hydration.  The patient had a
decreased O2 saturation and increased respiratory rate in the AM
[**7-17**] and a CT chest was performed which incidentally revealed a
large amount of intraabdominal air.  CT abd PO/IV contrast was
then performed and demonstrated large free air with sigmoid
perforation likely due to diverticulitis.  He has
hemodynamically
stable.  He did have a fever to 102 F prior to being transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**], however before this he had been afebrile without
chills/nausea/emesis.  He also denies any abnormality in the
frequency, consistency or color of his stools.  He was noted to
have abdominal distention and he received levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

[**2134-7-21**] CXR :
Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions are
similar to that seen one day prior. The new major abnormality
consists of left lower lobe collapse, with leftward shift of the
heart and mediastinal contents. No pneumothorax is seen.

[**2134-7-23**] CXR :
The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is
unchanged compared to the prior study. The NG tube passes below
the
diaphragm. There is interval worsening of pulmonary edema and
increase in
bilateral pleural effusions as well as no change in the left
retrocardiac
opacity consistent with atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to ACS service on [**2134-7-18**].  After extensive
discussion with the patient and his four daughters, decision was
made to proceed to the operating room
emergently for exploration.  While in the OR, the pt underwent a
sigmoid resection with an end left colostomy.  He tolerated the
surgery well and was brought to the PACU for recovery.  He
maintained stable hemodynamics and had adequate pain control.

CVS - pt with known history of a.fib, was persistently
tachycardic to low 100's/110's while on the surgical unit.  His
pre op Lopressor was resumed and adjusted for rate control.
Currentlt on 25 mg of Lopressor TID his heart rate is in the
80's. His preop Coumadin was restarted at 3 mg daily on [**2134-7-26**]
but his INR is only 1.1.  He will receive Coumadin 5 mg tonight
and have his Coumadin dosed daily based on his INR to achieve a
goal between 2.0 and 2.5.

Pulm - On [**7-21**], pt triggered for decreased O2 saturation and
increased O2 requirement.  Sats dropped to low 80's on 3LNC,
while HR was in the 140's; pt was placed on NRB mask and
transferred to the ICU for further management. He underwent
vigorous pulmonary toilet and nebulizer treatments but
eventually required intubation.  He had copious secretions and
underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2134-7-22**]. Multiple plugs were
suctioned out and BAL was positive for MRSA  He was extubated on
[**2134-7-23**] without difficulty.  Currently he is on 2L oxygen with
saturations in the 94-96 range and is continuing with
bronchodilator therapy as well as the incentive spirometer.

GI/GU - On [**7-20**], pt noted to have grossly edematous penis and
scrotum.  On [**7-21**], pt only able to void x2 throughout the day;
bladder scanned for >850cc in the early afternoon.  Urology
consulted to place catheter due to difficult anatomy with
significant swelling.  Catheter placed successfully and he
failed another voiding trial on [**2134-7-26**].  His urine culture is
also positive for MRSA. He will follow up with the [**Hospital 159**]
Clinic for a voiding trial next week.

ID : Vancomycin was started on [**2134-7-22**] for a 2 week course thru
[**2134-8-4**] for MRSA in 2 areas.  His dose has been adjusted
and his last trough was [**2134-7-26**] at 18.6.  Currently he is on 1000
mg IV BID and his creatinine is 0.8.  A left basilic PICC line
was placed on [**2134-7-27**] for long term antibiotics.

Mr. [**Known lastname 7716**] did remarkably well after his transfer to the
Surgical floor.  His diet was gradually advanced to regular and
his ostomy was active. His blood sugars were in good control and
he was on blood sugar checks QID. He was seen by the ostomy
nurse daily for ostomy care, teaching and management and he was
gradually learning as were his daughters.  His surgical incision
was healing well and he was actively working with Physical
therapy to regain mobility and return home soon.

He was discharged to rehab on [**2134-7-27**] and will follow up in the
[**Hospital 2536**] Clinic in [**1-27**] weeks.
