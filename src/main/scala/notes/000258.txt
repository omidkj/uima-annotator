ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Right colon cancer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and
elevated cholesterol who, on an evaluation as an outpatient,
was found to be anemic and a colonoscopy revealed a right
colon cancer in [**2183-12-18**].  The patient was then
scheduled for elective right colectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Procardia 60 mg p.o. q.d.
Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Insulin 409 units of NPH q.a.m.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient had an open
cholecystectomy in [**2162**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient had an allergy to penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of
98.8??????F, a heart rate of 100, a blood pressure of 136/59,
respirations of 18 and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room
air.  In general, the patient was a pleasant, obese, elderly
woman.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the
mucous membranes were moist.  The neck had no
lymphadenopathy.  The heart had a regular rate and rhythm.
The lungs were clear.  The abdomen was soft.  There was mild
right sided tenderness and the abdomen was nondistended.

LABORATORY:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
13,100 with a hematocrit of 35.5 and a platelet count of
543,000.  Potassium was 4.0.  BUN was 12 and creatinine was
0.7.  Glucose was 130.

RADIOLOGY:  A chest x-ray showed no evidence of infiltrate or
metastatic disease.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  An electrocardiogram had sinus rhythm at
100.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for bowel prep and
tolerated the bowel prep.  On [**2184-1-2**], she underwent right
colectomy without complications.  Postoperatively on that
night, the patient was stable.  However, she required
intravenous fluid bolus for low urine output.

On postoperative day #1, the patient continued to require
intravenous fluid boluses for urine output and developed a
persistent tachycardia.  After receiving intravenous fluid
resuscitating without good response to intravenous fluid
bolus, the patient became short of breath and was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.

The patient was treated for congestive heart failure and was
ruled in for a myocardial infarction with electrocardiogram
changes and elevated levels of troponin.  A cardiology
consultation was requested and an echocardiogram was
performed, which revealed a significantly decreased ejection
fraction of approximately 15% with severe hypokinesis and
akinesis of the inferior and lateral walls.  The patient was
started on beta blocker and ACE inhibitor for afterload
reduction to optimize her hemodynamics.  The patient was also
started on aspirin.

Once her hemodynamics were optimized and diuresis of fluid
was initiated, the patient improved and, on postoperative day
#4, she was transferred back to the hospital floor.  The
patient then soon passed flatus and was slowly advanced to a
regular diet.  She was continued on Lasix diuresis as well as
beta blockade, afterload reduction and aspirin.

The patient continued to do well with good response to
diuresis and improved pulmonary function and was saturating
well on room air and breathing comfortably.  On postoperative
day #9, the patient was tolerating a regular diet and was
ambulatory with physical therapy.  However, the patient
required significant assistance, which indicated a
rehabilitation transfer.

On postoperative day #7, an ultrasound of the right upper
extremity was performed, which showed a cephalic vein deep
vein thrombosis, and the patient was started on Coumadin at
that time for treatment of the deep vein thrombosis as well
as for prophylaxis for the severe wall motion abnormality of
the heart.
