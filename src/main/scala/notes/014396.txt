Mr. [**Known lastname 89451**] is a 69 year old male with COPD (on 3L home O2 and

in [**State 1727**]. Procedure complicated by persistent alveolopleural
fistula, still requiring chest tube on constant suction. He is
being admitted for elective endobronchial intervention to see if
the fistula can be sealed, possibly with an endobronchial valve
or plug.

Imaging:
[**2-23**] PCXR:
FINDINGS: No previous images. Evidence of prior surgical
procedure on the
right with a small amount of subcutaneous gas along the chest
wall. No
evidence of pneumothorax. Diffuse prominence of interstitial
markings
consistent with the clinical observation of pulmonary fibrosis.
Left central
catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
.
[**3-7**] PCXR:
There is interval worsening
of now moderate right pneumothorax. A right-sided chest tube
remains in the
right lateral pleural space, unchanged. Clips in the right
superior hilum and suture lines in the right upper lung are
compatible with the reported wedge resection. Ther
