Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
Non-healing right toe ulcers.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PROCEDURES:
1. Right superficial femoral artery to posterior tibial
    artery bypass using left upper arm vein.
2. Angioscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 72-year-old female who has undergone
endovascular procedures on both legs and is recently status
post right first and second toe amputations which were found
in the clinic to not be healing well. The patient was
admitted for repeat angiography which revealed no
endovascular options. The patient was then deemed a candidate
for a distal bypass.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum.  No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Normal IVC
diameter (1.5-2.5cm) with >50%  decrease during respiration
(estimated RAP 5-10 mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus. TDI E/e'
>15,
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending  aorta. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch
coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Severe
AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Moderate mitral  annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+)
MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing,  the severity of MR may be
significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate  [[**2-9**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

Conclusions:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D  or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left  ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is  normal. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior and infero-lateral akinesis. The remaininf segmetns are
hypokinetic.  No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging  suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There  is no
ventricular septal defect. There is mild global right
ventricular free  wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve  leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are  mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+)  mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of  mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension.

Compared to the prior study (reviewed) dated [**2100-6-14**], the overall
LVEF has
decreased. The AS remains severe.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 12925**],[**Known firstname 539**] C was admitted on [**9-20**] with Non-healing
right toe ulcers. She agreed to have an elective surgery.
Pre-operatively, she was consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC,
Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained,  all other preperations were
made.

Pt with known aortic stenosis, cardiology consulted. cleared for
surgery
Pt also on HD pre-operative, renal was consulted. They followed
the pt closely. Recommendations were adhered to. She recieved
regular HD on her scheduled day.

It was decided that she would undergo a Right superficial
femoral artery to posterior tibial artery bypass using left
upper arm vein.

She was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, she was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. She tolerated the procedure
well without any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, she was extubated and transferred to the CSRU
for further stabilization and monitoring. She remained in the
CSRU vetilated with pressure support for a number of days. While
she was there she developed a pna. This was treated with
Antibiotics.

She was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While
in the VICU she recieved monitered care. When stable she was
delined. Her diet was advanced. A PT consult was obtained. When
she was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative
care, she was transfered to floor status

On the floor, she remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. She progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. She continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. She was discharged home with [**Month/Year (2) 269**]
services.

To note PT recommended rehab / PT refused rehab. Pt did not want
to stay in the hospital fo
