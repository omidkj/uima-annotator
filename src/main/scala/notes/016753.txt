History of Present Illness:
68 yo male with ESRD on dialysis, HTN, L BKA, CAD, presents with
fevers (Tm 103.8 per EMS at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]), rigors, hypotension
(90/60s in field, 100/52 in ED) and altered mental status. In
the ED, got 1 gm tylenol PR and ampicillin/sulbactam and

Echo [**2200-1-8**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and
hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall. The remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric jet of mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen directed along the lateral wall.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left and right ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD (LV and RV infarction). Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2200-1-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 28 cm (23 cm tip-to-cuff
length) Angiodynamics Even More hemodialysis catheter. The
catheter tip is in the right atrium. The catheter is ready to
employ.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 69 yo M w/ ESRD, HTN, DM p/w fever, hypotension from line
sepsis.
.
1. Sepsis:
The pt initially presented to the ICU with sepsis requiring
pressors. The suspected source was the HD catheter and this was
pulled. The patient was covered with broad spectrum empiric
antibiotics. The blood cultures showed Prevotella 1/4 bottles,
which was clearly no confirmatory for line infection, although
no other definitive source was identified and line infection was
most likely. The antibiotics were changed to vanc/unasyn which
was continued until [**1-21**] which was a 14 day course. A new HD
line was placed on [**1-16**].
.
2. Cardiac:
a. Ventricular tachycardia:
On [**1-20**], the pt was being prepared for discharge to rehab and
he was noted to have episodes of non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia noted on telemetry monitor. The patient has EF 35%
and known scar. EP was consulted and in their estimation, the
patient was not a candidate for ICD given the ESRD and infection
risk. Metoprolol was continued.  He will be monitored on tele at
the acute rehab facility for one more week.
.
b. Atrial fibrillation:
The patient was noted to have episodes of atrial fibrillation,
although he mostly remained in sinus rhythm. Anticoagulation was
started on [**1-21**] with heparin bridge and coumadin. He was
monitored for bleeding given that he had a significant bleed
from his sacral decubitis ulcer requiring transfusion after
debridement. Metoprolol was continued as well. Amiodarone was
started for maintenence of NSR. This was started at 200 mg TID
and should be continued at this frequency for three more weeks
after discharge. Then frequency should be decreased to once per
day after that.  At discharge, his INR was 2.6. At the nursing
facility, the patient will continue to have daily PT/INR until
his INR is stable. He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
Electrophysiology.
.
b. CHF, EF 35%:
On echo, the patient was noted to have EF 35%. He remained
euvolemic after the sepsis had resolved. Fluid control was with
dialysis. Low dose lisinopril was started towards the end of his
hospital
