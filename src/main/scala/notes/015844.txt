Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was in passenger side of a car when it drove off the road in
the morning of [**2126-10-23**]. Car rolled multiple times, pt partially
ejected onto the left side. Her left chest and arm were pinned
under the car for approximately 20-30min before EMS arrived. She
denies LOC during the event.

Neuro:  Pt was initially intubated and sedated.  Pain was
controlled initially with IV narcotics and then patient was
transitioned to PO pain medications which she was discharged
with.  Pt also provided with PCA for additional pain control.

CVS:  Pt had tight control of heart rate and blood presure while
inpatient.

Pulm:  Pt developed pna after suffering her chest trauma.  She
was given PCA coverage for pain but did not perform adequate IS.
 Pt was treated with cipro for her pna and at the time of
discharge had a normalized white count and was afebrile.  Pt was
able to tolerate significant exertion with PT including climbing
and descending stairs,

Psych: Pt was on large home doses of zoloft.  Pt had an acute
stress reaction during her hospitalization.  She was seen by
psych who recommended tapering her zoloft from 400 to 200.  This
was undertaken during this hospitalization.  In addition, pt was
given script for risperdal to deal with the acute stress
response.  This medication was not continued as an oupatient.

msk:52 F with crush injury, with persistent left hand
parasthesias and weakness. Exam suggests both weakness and
sensory change in areas of ulnar and radial distribution. She
has difficulty abducting the left 5th digit, as well as
extension of the left thumb and 1st digit. She also has
generalized weakness of left hand extension of her digits. She
also has decreased sensation in an ulnar distruction pattern
distally. However, her strength is otherwise intact proximally,
as are her reflexes. This suggests generalized ulnar/radial
injury located somewhere near the elbow. This was likely due to
compression injury of the soft tissue structures as well. There
are no signs or symptoms to suggest nerve transsection or acute
separation. There are also no signs to suggest cervical,
brainstem, or cortical injury at this time.
