Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheoplasty and collapsed right middle lobe.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-10-14**] Left Thoracentesis.
[**2114-10-10**] Right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
thoracic duct ligation and mechanical and chemical
pleurodesis (500 mg doxycycline).
[**2114-10-3**] Flexible bronchoscopy
[**2114-9-28**] Right right thoracotomy, right middle lobectomy,
thoracic tracheoplasty with mesh, right main stem
bronchus/bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh, left main
stem bronchus bronchoplasty with mesh, flexible bronchoscopy
with bronchoalveolar lavage.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3060**] is a 65-year-old woman with severe and diffuse
tracheobronchomalacia. She also has COPD. She did have a
silicone Y-stent trial, and her dyspnea
improved markedly. Because of this, we did recommend cautiously
to move forward with tracheobronchoplasty to correct the
excessive dynamic collapsibility of her airway. She did
understand that, given her concomitant COPD, she was
a higher risk than usual for this extensive invasive procedure.
In addition, she has a chronically collapsed right middle lobe.
I did not think this was likely to re-expand well simply as a
result to the tracheoplasty; therefore, I
recommended that we remove it at the time of operation to
improve her VQ matching.

MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

[**2114-10-12**]):    No significant growth.

CXR
[**2114-10-18**] CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Comparison is made to a prior study
from earlier the same
day. Again noted is a small right apical pneumothorax, which is
stable in
size. The heart is normal in size. There is no consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the chest. No evidence for
pneumothorax
following removal of two chest tubes.
[**2114-10-2**]:PA and lateral chest compared to [**10-1**]. Moderate
bilateral
pleural effusions, are stable on the left and increased on the
right. Tiny
right apical pneumothorax is new or newly apparent. Left lower
lobe collapse is stable. Heart size normal.
[**2114-10-1**] Small right pneumothorax has decreased in amount.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Moderate left pleural
effusion with associated adjacent atelectasis is probably
unchanged allowing the difference in position of the patient.
Small right pleural effusion has slightly increased with
increase in adjacent basal atelectasis. There is mild vascular
congestion.
[**2114-9-30**] Chest tube is present at the right upper lobe. Small
locule of air at the right upper lobe unchanged. Tiny probable
pneumothorax. Scarring right middle lobe region with clips.
There is a small left pleural effusion as well as left lower
lobe atelectasis.
[**2114-9-28**]: Interval development of left upper lobe atelectasis
versus consolidation. Right pleural thickening and patchy
airspace opacification. Right-sided chest tubes unchanged.
Continued scarring right mid lung zone.


PICC: [**2114-10-13**] right PICC line tip terminates in the mid to
lower portion of the SVC.

[**2114-10-16**] Lower extremity doppler: No evidence of DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 3060**] was admitted on [**2114-9-28**] for Right right thoracotomy,
right middle lobectomy,thoracic tracheoplasty with mesh, right
main stem bronchus/bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh,
left main stem bronchus bronchoplasty with mesh, flexible
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.  She was extubated in
the operating room.

Respiratory: Breath sounds were rhonchus. Aggressive pulmonary
toilet, chest PT and mucolytics with nebs were administered with
improvement. Her oxygen saturations were 93-96% on 2L nasal
cannula.  Home inhalers Spiriva were restarted.

Flexible bronchoscopy was done [**2114-10-3**] which showed normal
trachea, LM, RM no edema.  [**Hospital1 **] edema. Thick secretions distally

Pleural Effusion: [**2114-10-5**] the CXR revealed RLL effusion which
was drain for 2.4 Liters of milky substance.  Triglycerides were
sent and was positive for a chylothorax.  On [**2114-10-6**] a Right
Pigtail was placed with 1.2 Liters drainage of chlylothorax.  On
[**2114-10-10**] she was taken to the operating room for Right
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery thoracic duct ligation and
mechanical and chemical pleurodesis (500 mg doxycycline).  On
[**2114-10-14**] CXR revealed LLL effusion which was drained for 800cc
of fluid.  Chest-tubes: remained to suction until [**2114-10-18**].  The
posterior apical chest tube was removed on [**2114-10-17**].  The
anterior apical and basilar chest tubes were removed [**2114-10-18**].

Cardiac: She was started on lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] with HR 70.s
sinus rhythm.  Blood pressure stable in the 110-120's.  The home
dose diltiazem 240 mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily were not
restarted during this hospitalization secondary her blood
pressure and heart rate would not tolerate.

GI: Protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] were continued.  Normal bowel function

Nutrition: She tolerated a regular diet until [**2114-10-13**] she was
challenge with a low fat diet with residual chyle drainage was
noted.  Her diet was changed to clear liquid and TPN was
started.

Endocrine: glucophage 500 mg daily was restarted.  Fingerstick
blood sugars were 125-150.
GU: foley removed she voided without difficulty

ID: UTI initially treated with Macobid and cultures grew
ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES was changed to Bactrim DS. Her white
count was slowly increasing with no fevers. On [**2114-10-8**]
serviellence blood cultures were sent 1 bottle was po
