Chief Complaint:
Cholangitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Left internal jugular triple lumen catheter placement on [**2165-5-17**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with left hip fx [**3-/2164**] s/p ORIF and THR [**2165-5-9**], HTN and
osteoporosis who was found to have cholangitis/cholecystitis and
sepsis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  The
patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2165-5-9**] for
total hip replacement, which she tolerated well.  Her hospital
course has been complicated by multiple issues.  She was
intitally found to have thrombocytopenia after receiving
Lovenox, although HIT antibody panel was negative.  She was
switched to warfarin and INR [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70020**] to over 5 and this was
held, she was reversed with PO Vitamin K.  During this time, she
was increasingly anemic and received 3 units PRBCs.  Hct reached
a nadir of 24, platelets reached a nadir of 72 and were normal
in the 200s less than 1 month prior.

On [**5-14**], she was found to have decreasing blood pressure and
there was concern for sepsis.  She received fluid resuscitation
and was pancultued.  A RUQ US at [**Hospital1 **] showed evidence of
cholecystitis and CBD dilation to 1.3cm with stones and sludge
in the gall bladder.  She was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics with vanc/Zosyn .  Tbili was elevated to 7.4 and
Dbili to 5.1 with ALT/AST to 214/483.  He was

On arrival to the MICU, she is feeling well with no complaints.
Denies N/V, abd pain, subjective fever or chills.  She also
denies any pain over her recent hip replacement.  Denies cough
or SOB.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2165-5-21**]**

   C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2165-5-21**]):
      Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA
      amplification assay.
           (Reference Range-Negative

STUDIES:
[**2165-5-15**] CXR:
The lung volumes are low.  There is moderate-to-severe
cardiomegaly, with the border of the left heart reaching the
left chest wall. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely
caused by left pleural effusion, extensive retrocardiac
atelectasis.  On the right, there is an increase in interstitial
structures, potentially resulting from interstitial fluid
overload.  A minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
The visible parts of the hilar structures appear normal.

[**2165-5-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild-moderate global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin,
metabolic; multivessel CAD less likely). Right ventricular
cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery
hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. Increased PCWP.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2159**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

[**2165-5-16**] ERCP:
- Two small and one large periampullary diverticulums were found
adjacent to the major papilla.
- The CBD contained multiple large and small filling defects
consistent with stones.
- The distal CBD measured 10 mm while the proximal bile duct
measured 15 mm - the distal narrowing was likely from
compression from adjacent diverticulum as no stricture was seen.

- A limited sphincterotomy was performed
- A wire-guided CRE balloon was then used to perform
sphincteroplasty dilating the ampulla and distal CBD to 12 mm.
- Multiple balloon sweeps subsequently removed a 10 mm stone,
multiple stone fragments and debris, and sludge.
- [sphincterotomy, sphincteroplasty, stone extraction]
- Final cholangiogram was clear without filling defects and
there was good flow of bile at end of procedure thus a biliary
stent was not placed.

[**2165-5-18**] LUE non-invasives:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Echogenic thrombus adjacent to the left IJ catheter.  This
does not appear to extend into the left subclavian vein.
2.  No DVT detected within the left subclavian, axillary, or
brachial veins.
3.  Note that images 8 through 15 are of the LEFT extremity, not
the right as originally labeled.
