discharged back to his nursing home.  Prior to that, he was
admitted to [**Hospital1 **] with bleeding from his G-tube and coffee ground
emesis.  Upper endoscopy showed multiple ulcers throughout the
esophagus as well as an antral erosion and hiatal hernia.

On arrival to the ED, the patient's VS T 97.5 BP 133/77 HR 108
RR 14 SaO2 99%RA.  His breathing was stable in the ED here.  He
was reportedly guaiac positive on rectal exam.  Labs were
significant for stable Hct at 35.  WBC was elevated at 16.9.  He
was started on a PPI gtt and admitted to medicine for further
management.

On arrival to the floor, the patient was in no acute distress.
He produced a stool which was guaiac negative.

ROS was unable to be obtained [**12-27**] patient's baseline mental
status.

Brief Hospital Course:
58-year-old man with NSCLC/adenocarcinoma of lung with
metastases to brain, s/p resection ([**2139**] and [**2140**]), seizure
disorder ([**2140**]), stroke([**2156**]) with residual deficits, brought in
after an episode of coffee group emesis at his nursing home this
morning.

# Coffee Ground Emesis: Hct stable on arrival, stool guaiac
negative on the floor. No further episodes of coffee ground
emesis on the floor. GI followed the patient and ultimately
repeated EGD.  This showed similar findings to prior EGD
(esophageal ulcers).  The patient was transitioned to comfort
measures only and tube feeds were stopped. No further
hematocrits were checked.

# C.Diff Colitis: Patient was noted to have increasing WBC
several days into hospital course. CXR was negative, UA
unremarkable. Stool ended up being positive for c.diff. Given
classification of severe c.diff (WBC 30), the patient was
started on high-dose PO vanc and IV flagyl. ID was consulted.
Patient continued to have profuse diarrhea and became
hypotensive with systolic pressures to the 70s-80s, with bouts
of Afib with RVR, at which time he was transferred to the MICU.
In the MICU, tigecycline was added for concern for complicated
intraabdominal infection as well as refractory C.diff.  Surgery
was consulted and felt there was no urgent need to go to OR
given no free air on x-ray.  They recommended antibiotics and
careful monitoring with abdominal exams, vitals and labs.  The
lactate was monitored and trended down from 4.9 on [**6-24**] to 0.9
on [**6-25**].  His abdominal exam improved and he remained afebrile,
however his white count remained elevated. He was transitioned
to comfort measures only and antibiotics were stopped.

#Hypotension: The patient was transferred to the ICU on [**2160-6-24**]
for with C. difficile colitis.  His hypotension responded to
aggressive fluid resuscitation.  His Afib with RVR was
intermittent and responded to fluid boluses as well as IV
metoprolol.  Because of concern for worsening hypotension, he
was not started on standing metoprolol.  A central IJ line was
placed on [**2160-6-24**] for improved access. He was transitioned to
CMO and no further blood pressures were checked.

# ? Aspiration: There was a question of aspiration at the NH
prior to patient's initial presentation. However, on arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**], respiratory status was at baseline. OSH CXR was reviewed
and was unremarkable. However, in the ICU he had another
presumed aspiration event resulting in intubation. In discussion
with the family it was decided to transition to CMO and the
patient was extubated. Tube feeds were stopped.
