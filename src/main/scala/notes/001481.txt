Surgeon:

HOSPITAL  COURSE:    Mr.  [**Name14 (STitle) 96179**] initial medical problems
began  in [**2-/2143**] when he underwent cauterization for duodenal
ulcer.   After the procedure, he had progressive weakness and
numbness,  which  escalated  until  [**Month (only) 359**],  [**2143**],  when  he
presented  to  [**Last Name (un) 33526**]  with  emesis  and abdominal pain.  He
underwent  a  laparotomy and appendectomy with no evidence of
small-bowel  obstruction.    He  was diagnosed with ileus and
subsequently  had  profound weakness with the ability only to
move  his  tongue.    He was intubated and transferred to the
[**Hospital1 756**]  and  [**Hospital 44770**]  Hospital  Neurological  Intensive Care
Unit, where he was then diagnosed with possible Gullain-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome.  He was treated with IVIG, plasmapheresis with mild
improvement.      He   was  discharge  to  rehabilitation  on
[**2143-12-12**].  Hospital stay has been complicated by aspiration
pneumonia, MRSA in sputum, persistent ileus, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] fungina,
right  hemithorax  with chest tube.  He was readmitted to the
[**Hospital1 756**]  Womens'  on  [**2144-1-25**] with increased secretions and
acute  hypoxia.    He  was  treated  for pneumonia and he had
multiple bronchoscopies.  He was then discharged to [**Hospital1 1319**].
He  is  now  admitted  to  the  [**Hospital1 188**]  because  of  unavailability  of  beds  at [**Hospital1 756**] [**Hospital5 **]
[**Hospital6 44770**] Hospital with presumed sepsis.  He was admitted under
the medical service for treatment.  Surgical consultation was
obtained  and  he  was then transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit because of vasopressor requirement to maintain his blood
pressures.     He  underwent  an  emergency  total  abdominal
colectomy  for presumed C. difficile colitis on the 16th.  He
required vasopressor support in the operating room and he was
transferred   ventilated   to   the   Intensive   Care   Unit
postoperatively.

A  CT  angiogram  had  been  performed secondary to a widened
mediastinum  seen  after  an  attempted line placement.  This
revealed  a  pulmonary  embolism.   He subsequently underwent
placement  of  an IVC filter after his abdominal colectomy on
the 16th.

In  the  Intensive  Care Unit he required ventilatory support
and  vasopressor  support  for  the  next day.  He was slowly
weaned  off  the  vasopressor  support and ventilator support
over  the  next  couple of days.  During this time the G tube
continued to have high outputs, which apparently had been the
case since his stay in the rehabilitation.  He was weaned off
the   ventilator  on  the  18th,  and  he  was  tolerating  a
tracheostomy  mask.  He was deemed stable for transfer to the
regular  floor  on  the  19th   He was restarted on his total
parenteral nutrition.

He  was  stable  on the floor.  On the 20th, a clamping trial
for  the G-tube was attempted with plans to start tube feeds.
This  was  unsuccessful and the G tube was unclamped and left
to  gravity.  The G tube continues to have high outputs.  The
electrolytes were repleted over the next few days.  He is now
deemed  ready to return to rehabilitation on total parenteral
nutrition with his G tube to gravity.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  ....................20 mg IV q.6h.
2.  Lopressor 5 mg q.6h.
3.  Flagyl 500 mg q.8h. to be discontinued on [**2144-4-7**].
4.  Morphine sulfate 1 mg q.2h.p.r.n.
5.  Total parenteral nutrition.
6.  Protonix 40 mg IV q.d.
7.  Insulin sliding scale.
8.    Fluid  replacements  for  G  tube  output ?????? per cc loss
replaced with ?????? normal saline.

FOLLOW-UP  CARE:    The  patient  should  followup  with  his
physicians  at  the  [**Hospital1 756**] [**Hospital5 **] [**Hospital6 44770**] Hospital for further
issues.
