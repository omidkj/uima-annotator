Imaging:
CT head non-contrast ([**2127-12-12**]): No acute intracranial process.
Sinus disease as described above.
.
EEG with video monitoring ([**2128-12-14**]): Final report pending.
Interpretation by neuro was that episodes of shaking show no
correlated signs of seizure acitivty on EEG.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with concern for alcohol withdrawal and
seizure activity. Admission labs were notable for low grade
anemia to Hct 34 otherwise normal electrolytes, LFT's and
pancreatic enzymes. Non-contrast head CT was negative for
bleeding. The patient was placed on a CIWA scale with valium.
The patient had clinical signs of good control of withdrawal
symptoms including normal heartrate and blood pressure and only
minimal tremulousness throughout his hospitalization.

The patient had numerous episodes of unresponsiveness
characterized by rigid, low frequency shaking of the upper and
lower extremities. These episodes were witnessed by both the
primary medical team and the neurology consult service.
Initially there was concern for EtOH withdrawal seizures.
Ultimately these were deemed to be pseudoseizures. This was
confirmed by EEG with video monitoring which revealed no seizure
activity at the time of the events, reviewed by the neurology
consult team. Initially the patient was treated with IV ativan
during these episodes with rapid resolution of his symptoms.
Later in his hospitalization he received IV saline with similar
rapid resolution of symptoms. These episodes last for up to 15
minutes without intervention before spontaneously remitting.
When these episodes end there is rapid return of interactive,
appropriately oriented mentation within seconds to minutes.
Sometimes the patient appears confused within the first minute
after an episode. He has no incontinence or tongue biting.

The patient was confirmed to have polysubstance abuse on urine
tox screen including cocaine positive status. This test was also
positive for benzo's and opiates after the patient received
benzo's as part of CIWA scale and morphine as part treatment for
abdominal pain.

The patient complained of severe abdominal pain. Initially there
was concern for pancreatitis in the setting of EtOH use however
the patient had normal pancreatic enzymes and abdominal exam was
entirely benign. He initially received narcotic pain medications
however he does not require ongoing narcotics.

Anemia. Presumed secondary to chronic alcohol use. Iron studies,
B12 and folate were within normal limits. The patient can have
further work-up as an outpatient.

As work-up for lower extremity neuropathy noted on neurology
consultation, the patient had HgbA1c at goal, normal TSH. SPEP
was notable for a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and UPEP was
normal. CRP was normal and ESR was mildly elevated at 23. This
can be further evaluated as an outpatient.

For his history of hypertension, the patient was continued on
home clonidine.

Depression. The patient was continued on his outpatient
antidepressant regimen. He requested to be DNR/DNI. This should
be further addressed during psychiatric care after discharge.

The patient was medically cleared for discharge on [**2127-12-16**].
