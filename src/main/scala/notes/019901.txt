Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB / cough with blood tinged sputum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Balloon valvuloplasty (aortic valve)


History of Present Illness:
78 year-old male with three vessel CAD s/p proximal LAD [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2,
sCHF (EF 25%), CKD (cr 2.2) and prior GI bleeds (angioectasias
vs hemorrhoidal bleeding) recently admitted in [**7-/2113**] for CHF
exacerbation and PNA (c/b uremic seizures treated with CVVH).
Patient presents after 1-2 weeks of progressive shortness of
breath and blood tinged sputum similar to prior admission.
Patient reports that one week after discharge from last
hospitalization, his symptoms of SOB and cough recurred and
progressively gotten worse.  Cough especially worse at night and
each time with red blood streaked sputum.  He reports 3 pillow
orthopnea, and PND.  He also reports fatigue and rarely getting
out of bed.  Not on O2 at rehab. Takes 100mg lasix [**Hospital1 **]. Denies
chest pain, chest pressure, fevers, chills.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.2 HR 82 BP 100/63 RR 20
98%4LNC
Labs significant for: BNP in middle of his range. Trop 2.30
(baseline 0.1-0.5).
CXR shows bilateral pleural effusions which are stable to mildly

increased. Mild pulmonary edema. Basilar compressive atelectatic
changes.
Given 40mg IV lasix and output 300cc + incontinence.  Given
Zosyn and Vanc to cover for possible pneumonia given prior
resistance.

Labs were significant for BUN 90, Cr 2.9, proBNP: [**Numeric Identifier 37374**], WBC
7.0, H/H 10.4/32.2, UA showed 100+ protein, 70 glucose

On arrival to the floor, patient VS T 97.8 BP 121/76 HR 84 RR 18
99%4LNC. He said he was breathing easier since arrival to the
hospital.  He denies SOB, CP, Dizziness, light headedness,
nausea, vomiting, denies any recent bloody BMs.  No BM x 6 days.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

DISCHARGE LABS:

[**2113-8-30**] CXR:
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The
left IJ central venous catheter has been removed. There is
persistent moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural
effusions which are stable to mildly increased. There is mild
pulmonary edema. Basilar atelectatic changes are
likely compressive. The aorta is unfolded. No pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pleural effusions with pulmonary edema
and basilar atelectasis.

[**2113-8-31**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the
inferior and posterior walls, dyskinesis of the apex, and
hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 0.6 cm2). This is likely to represent
"low-flow/low-gradient", or "pseudosevere" aortic stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen (functional ischemic mitral regurgitation
secondary to inferior posterior akinesis, papillary muscle
dysfunction, and tethering of the mitral leaflets). Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2113-3-21**], the left ventricle is more dilated, the mitral
regurgitation is markedly increased, and the effective aortic
valve orifice area is further reduced.

[**2113-9-5**] Aortic Balloon valvuloplasty:
COMMENTS:     Palliative aortic balloon valvuloplasty performed
for

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe aortic stenosis.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty complicated by
acute
ischemic stroke/TIA with recovery of neurological function.

[**2113-9-5**] CT head:
INDICATION: Status post BAV, now with transient right-sided
weakness and
dysphagia.

CT HEAD: Axial imaging was performed through the brain without
contrast.

COMPARISON: CT head, [**2113-2-12**].

FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or evidence
for an acute
major vascular territorial infarction is present. There is
prominence of the ventricles and the sulci which appear similar
to the prior examination, indicating moderate cerebral atrophy.
Several rounded foci of low attenuation are seen within the
corona radiata bilaterally and the left centrum semiovale,
unchanged and compatible with sequela of chronic smal
