Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
59 yo man w/ hx DM Type II, HTN, obesity who presented to the ED
with acutely worsening SOB, lightheadedness, diaphoresis
following BM.  Pt describes 3 days of DOE of 10 feet that he
first noticed ambulating while at work without noticable
precipitants.  Pt noted no other symptoms until the day of
admission, when he felt diaphoretic, lightheaded and nauseated
while moving his bowels.  He required assisstance to leave the
bathroom and subsequently contact[**Name (NI) **] EMS.  He noted severe SOB
and a sensation of vomiting during this episode. On admission to
the ED, he reported no CP, V/D, F/C/M, orthop, PND, dysuria,
incontinence, recent travel or sick contacts.

Vitals on presentation were 958-99-128/82-16-100% on NRB (100%).
A CXR was unremarkable and a CT was obtained in the setting of
continued SOB. CT chest demonstrated large PEs in the left main
and right main with invasion into the segmental/sub-segmental
branches.  Pt was started on heaprin gtt with improvement to
hemodynamic status. He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for 24 hour
observation (following that, spent 1 day awaiting transfer to
medicine). Since admission to the unit, pt notes no SOB, F/C/M,
N/V/D, CP. He has been hemodynamically stable is transferred for
further evaluation and observation.

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**12-14**]:
sinus with LAD, Q in II, III, aVF(old), no ST changes

CTA [**12-14**] :There  is  a  large  pulmonary embolus  within  the
left  main  pulmonary artery and multiple left segmental and
subsegmental  branches.There is also a large pulmonary embolus
in the right
main pulmonary artery and multiple segmental and subsegmental
branches.
In  the  right  middle  lobe,there is a more nodular density
measuring  approximately  7  mm, but this is adjacent  to a
vessel, and not clearly  separate from it. In  both  lower
lobes,there  are  peripheral opacities  which are more linear as
opposed to  wedge-shaped,  more likely atelectasis, although
infarcts cannot be excluded in  this setting.

Echo ([**12-15**]): Probably normal LV systolic function (due to poor
imager quality, a regional wall motion abnormality cannot be
excluded). Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation with
moderate pulmonary hypertension.

EKG ([**12-15**]): Sinus rhythm with slowing of the rate as compared to
the previous tracing  of [**2117-12-14**]. Ventricular ectopy is no
longer recorded. There is prior inferior myocardial infarction
and probable anterior myocardial infarction as well. Diffuse
non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. There is slight Q-T
interval prolongation. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2117-12-14**] ventricular ectopy has abated and the rate has slowed.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo man w/ hx of HTN, DM II who presents with large bilateral
pulmonary emboli of unknown source treated successfully with
anticoagulation.  He has been hemodynamically stable since
admission and notes no new complaints on transfer.

B/L PULM EMBOLI ?????? Large bilateral PE unaccounted for by hx ?????? no
hx long travel, coagulopathy. It is interesting, however, that
pt notes brother and sister (for a total of 3 out of 9 siblings)
that have presented to their respective physicians with clots. A
full set of studies (Factor V, homocysteine, lupus,
anti-cardiolipin ab, anti-thrombin, Protein C, S, etc) should be
considered ?????? will discuss w/ PCP as this may be best followed as
an outpt.  He received coumadin 10mg yesterday w/ no change in
INR (1.4) and 15mg this AM prior to transfer. His warfarin dose
was titrated up secondary to body mass and non-response on 10mg
and heparin gtt continued until INR was between 2 and 3. On the
day of discharge, his INR was therapeutic at 2.1 on 12.5mg
coumadin; however, given that he was therapeutic for less than
2days and he was adamant about leaving, lovenox 120mg SC Q12 x2
days was prescribed. He will need close follow-up as an outpt
for furter titration of warfarin. He will likely require
lifelong anticoagulation.

HTN: Anti-hypertensives were withheld as pt was normotensive in
the setting of massive bilateral PEs. Pt will follow-up with his
PCP to restart antihypertensives as an outpatient.

DMII: Pt's serum glucose was high on admission, but reasonably
well controlled on his home meds, pioglitazone 30' and glyburide
10" with RISS coverage. He was on a dibetic diet.

ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES : On admission, pt's transaminases were
noted to be elevated. This was thought secondary to increased
load in the right heart s/p PE. LFTs trended down during his
stay.

PRESYNCOPE: Likely a vasovagal response secondary to valsalva
during BM in combination with developing PEs. Remained
asymptomatic during this admission. Pt also has hx of elevated
creatinine (nl MB fraction) and ruled out for MI; no evidence of
another acute muscular condition.

PROPHY: receiving heparin, ambulating as tolerated

FEN: Diabetic diet

DISPO ?????? Upon successful transition to warfarin and development
of appropriate outpatient therapeutic strategy, pt was
discharged home. He will follow-up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 1313**] on Thursday
[**12-23**] and have an INR check Wed [**12-22**].
