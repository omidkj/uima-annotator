Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2173-11-23**] 7:49 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. MRI of the brain demonstrates two areas of diffusion signal
abnormality, which indicates recent infarction. There are new
areas of susceptibility artifacts since the old study, but
stable appearance of multiple chronic microvascular infarctions.

2. MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is extremely limited due to
motion artifact. Flow is observed in the major branches of this
circulation, but vessels cannot be further assessed.

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2173-11-23**] 3:05 PM
IMPRESSION:

1. Right lower lobe collapse/consolidation with small bilateral
pleural effusions.

2. Prominence of the intra and extrahepatic biliary duct system,
which is more than expected given the patient's age and history
of prior cholecystectomy. Clinical correlation with the
patient's LFTs is recommended.

3. Atrophic kidneys bilaterally with multiple complex cysts
demonstrated. One of these cysts within the mid pole of the
right kidney demonstrates enhancement after contrast
administration, which is concerning for a neoplastic process.
Further evaluation of these renal cysts can be performed with
MRI.

4. Patent mesenteric vessels without evidence of mesenteric
ischemia.

TTE:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation
seen.
6.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

EKG:
Sinus rhythm
Consider left atrial abnormality
Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction
Modest nonspecific low amplitude T waves
Since previous tracing of [**2173-11-23**], ventricular ectopy absent

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2173-11-28**] 11:00 AM
IMPRESSION: Probable atelectasis and/or scarring at both bases.
Slight blunting right costophrenic angle, which is equivocally
more prominent than on prior exams. Otherwise, no evidence of
acute pulmonary process.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2173-12-1**] 3:45 PM
1. Hyperdense bilateral kidney cysts, stable from the previous
examination and worrisome for neoplastic process in partcular in
the right kidney. Further evaluation of these cysts with MRI is
recommended.

2. Interval improvement of the right lower lobe consolidation
with small bilateral pleural effusions. The remaining right
nodular consolidation is worrisome for metastasis given the
appearance of the kidneys and followup is recommended.

3. Prominence of the intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal
system, stable compared to the prior examination.

4. Subcutaneous nodule in the left lateral abdominal wall of
uncertain clinical significance.

5. No evidence of colitis.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2173-11-26**] 1:49 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral exuberant calcifications at the carotid
bifurcations with approximately 60% stenosis at the right
internal and 30-40% stenosis at the left internal origins.

2. Moderate-to-severe stenosis of the bilateral cavernous and
supraclinoid internal carotid arteries with exuberant
calcifications.

3. Exuberant calcifications involving distal vertebral arteries
with more than 50% stenosis involving both distal vertebral
arteries, Left > Right.

4. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the basilar artery.

5. Somewhat poor opacification of the vascular structures could
be related to low contrast injection rate from inadequate IV
access.

6. Other changes as described above.

Abdominal MRI (prelim):
Likely bilateral renal cell carcinoma

PATH:
DIAGNOSIS:
Left below-the-knee amputation:
Gangrenous necrosis, distal foot.
Severe atherosclerosis.
Resection margins free of inflammation and necrosis.
