Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 848**]
Chief Complaint:
Hallucinations and possible seizure activity in the context of
presumed infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
History obtained from patient. 68F with PMH of neurogenic
bladder and recurrent resistant UTI's, pAF, HTN, HL, GERD, and
seizure disorder presenting with hallucinations. Per patient,
she was brought to the hospital by her sister because the place
where she is living "is full of evil." In support of this belief
she cites an occasion where she placed two glasses on either
side of a rosary and then asked someone at the facility to get
her a glass. They refused to pick up the glasses adjacent to the
rosary, which she attributes to them being afraid to go near the
rosary, as well as the fact that, if they picked up the glasses,
they would see that there is a spider inside. She is also
concerned about her sister because she has developed a dark spot
on her face, which is a sign of evil. She asks if I have ever
studied evil, and when I report that I have not, she becomes
tearful and states, "I really wish someone would." She
acknowledges that [**Last Name (un) 15025**] believes her and that it is likely that
I won't believe her either.

She denies dysuria or urgency, but does endorse frequency. She
denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. She
states she feels well physically, only complaining of mild pain
in her low back which is chronic for her. She is constipated,
which is her baseline.

ROS: As noted above, otherwise a ten point review of systems was
performed and negative.
