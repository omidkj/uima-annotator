History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 75980**] is an 85 year old female with a history of CAD,
atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure who was
transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital with fevers, cough and
vomiting.  The patient has recently been in and out of the
hospital four times over the past six weeks for urinary tract
infections and aspiration events now s/p PEG placement two weeks
ago.  She currently presents from rehab with feves, cough and
congestion x 2 days and vomiting x 1 day.  She was also noted to
have tachypnea and dizziness at her rehab.

Per the MICU admission note on presentation to [**Hospital **]
hospital she was noted to be afebrile, tachycardic to the low
100s with stable blood pressrue.  She later spiked a fever to
102.4 and developed an oxygen requirement.  Her labs were
notable for a sodium of 125, WBC count of 17.3 with 34% bands.
CXR at [**Hospital1 **] showed no focal infiltrates but was suggestive
of mild CHF.  She was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin
for possible pneumonia.  She received 500 cc IVF with increased
tachypnea and was subsequently given nitropaste for possible CHF
exacerbation.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room her initial vital signs were T; 99.3
HF: 130 (atril fibrillation), BP: 90/50 O2: 98% on RA.  Initial
labs were notable for leukocytosis and bandemia (WBC count of
23.1 with 9% bands), BNP of 4181, initial lactate of 3.1 which
improved to 2.1 with gentle hydration.  She had a negative UA.
Her CXR showed some questionable interstitial edema with no
focal infiltrates.  She had blood cultures sent.  She received
vancomycin in additio to the previously received ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.  She alos received 2L of normal saline with
improvement in her blood pressure.  She was transferred to the
ICU for further management.

While in the ICU her hemodynamics improved.  Her antibiotics
were changed to vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin.  She had
left IJ central line placed for IV access.  She had a negative
DFA.  She had a sputum culture which was polymicrobial and
cultures are pending.  Urine culture was negative.  Blood
cultures were drawn and were negative to date.  She was
transiently hypotensive the afternoon of MICU transfer in the
setting of receiving her home dose of diltaizem.  Her blood
pressure quickly improved with 250 NS bolus.  She is transferred
to the floor for further management.

On review of systems she denies fevers, chills, lightheadedness,
dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomtiing, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or
swelling.  She does report fatigue. All other review of systems
negative in detail.
