ECHO [**2166-6-19**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection
fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to akinesis of the inferior
free wall; the basal segment of the inferior free wall is mildly
dyskinetic and aneurysmal; the other walls of the left ventricle
appear mildly hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Impression: inferior infarct with aneurysmal deformation and
mild dyskinesis of the basal segment of the inferior free wall
.
.
VT mapping and ablation:
3 VT foci with LBB and L inferior access morphology originating
from RV below the tricuspid valve were ablated.
.
CXR [**2166-6-18**]:
1. Right upper lobe soft tissue density with spiculated margins
concerning
for malignancy. Two other possible densities on the left. CT of
the chest is recommended for further evaluation.
2. Right lower lung pleural effusion.
3. Left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
4. Changes consistent with COPD.
.
CT Scan Chest [**2166-6-20**]:
1. Multiple enlarged mediastinal nodes and left jugular node
with right upper lobe consolidation and bilateral pleural
effusions. These may be due to metastasis or lymphoma. Other
differentials include sarcoidosis and Castleman disease.
2. Extensive bilateral emphysema with diffuse septal thickening
which may be due to pulmonary edema.
3. Coronary artery calcifications and atherosclerotic changes in
the
descending aorta.
4. Large 6.7 cm right simple renal cyst.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo female with milde cardiomyopathy (EF 45-50%), moderate
dementia, severe COPD who presented with refractory VT
.
1) VT: The patient arrived in NSR, but soon after admission
converted to VT.  Throughout the course of that night the
patient was given a total of 300 mg amiodarone with an increase
in drip to 1mg/min, 200mg of lidocaine with an increase of rate
to 2mg/min, and was shocked 4 times.  She maintained her BP with
supplemental IVF for 45+ minutes of sustained VT at which time
she was shocked a final time and returned to sinus rhythm.
Given high levels of sedatives used for multiple shocks, patient
was markedly sedated and needed intubation due to suppressed
respiratory rate.  Patient was shocked with 100J each time given
that she was minimally sedated and this level was successful in
converting the patient at the OSH.  A temporary pacing was was
inserted that night for potential antitachycardia pacing in the
event of future runs of VT. Patient had no further episodes that
night and had VT mapping and ablation the following day, was
quickly extubated after the procedure.  She was loaded with
Amiodarone (200mg TID x 3 days, then 200mg [**Hospital1 **] x 3 days, then
400 mg qd until follow appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-14**] weeks).
The patient did not receive a defibrillator given concern for
quality of life with multiple shocks and relatively low
likelihood of future shocks s/p ablation.
.
2) Pneumonia:  During her hospitalization she had an elevated
WBC count, decreased breath sounds, and sputum grew GNR, patient
was treated for presumed pnemonia with ceftriaxone for 5 days,
converted to cefpodoxime PO for 1 day before discharge on
levofloxacin for 4 more days.  Patient's pulmonary status was
fair after extubation and continued to improve as she returned
to her home regimen of 4L oxygen NC.
.
3) Cellulitis/Superficial thrombophlebitis:Patient had an
infiltrated IV on her left forearm at the OSH which became more
erythematous and swollen and was concerning for cellulitis,
patient was then started on IV vancomycin.  While on vancomycin
her left forearm improved, however she developed erythema and
swelling on her right forearm which did not improved despite
vancomycin.  Dermatology consult believed this lesion to be a
superficial thrombophlebitis, vanco was d/c'd, and lesion
improved with warm compresses.
.
4) COPD: Patient did require additional oxygen during
hospitalization due to pnemonia and COPD exacerbation, however
she returned to 4L NC for 2 days prior to discharge.
.
5) Systolic CHF: Patient did require lasix intermittently
throughout her visit due to congestion.  (EF 30%)  Will continue
20 mg Lasix QD as outpatient.
.
6) Lymphadenopathy: Admission CXR with right uppper lobe
spiculated nodule concerning for malignancy.  CT Chest (see
results) without mass but concerning for malignancy/infiltrative
disease given lymphadenopathy.  Patient advised to get a follow
up CT scan in approximately 1 month after her pneumonia has
resolved to reassess the lymphnodes.  Also advised patient to
make an appt with Dr. [**Name (NI) **] for follow up.
.
7) Alzheimers Dementia: Continued aricept while inpatient.
.
8) FEN: Patient was started on Calcium carbonate due to low
calcium levels, and needed occasional repletion of potassium and
magnesium during admission to keep K>4 and Mg>2.  She was
advanced to a heart healthy diet by the time of discharge.
.
