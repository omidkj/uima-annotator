Brief Hospital Course:
33 y/o female s/p PAK on [**2190-9-23**] doing well at home but now
presents with fever to 102 on day of admission. Had chills the
previous day and decreased energy. Patient was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics. Chest xray on [**10-6**] shaowed no acute
cardiopulmonary process. CTA on [**10-7**] shows transplant pancreas
in right iliac fossa with mild surrounding edema. There is
external compression of donor splenic/portal vein, which remains
patent, and thrombus in the distal SMV. Patent arterial Y graft
with some thrombus in the distal donor SMA that appears beyond
branches that supply the pancreas, though this is uncertain.
Transplant kidney in left iliac fossa with mild calyectasis.
On [**10-9**] patient had fever to 104 and was having a worsening
respiratory status with hypoxemia. Patient was transferred to
the ICU where she underwent a bronchoscopy and elective
intubation. Chest xray on that day post intubation showed
worsened diffuse confluent opacities consistent with worsened
pulmonary edema, most likely with an infectious component(but
could be pulmonary hemorrhage or infection). Bronchoalveolar
lavage cultures were negative for Legionella, p carinii. Fungal
elements negative by KOH and acid fast bacilli (by smear,
culture remains pending)
Blood cultures taken throughout the hospitalization remained
negative. Patient also tested for cryptococcal antibodies,
toxoplasmosis, CMV which were all negative.
She did have diarrhea intermittently throughout the course, C
diff negative x 4, as well as stool culture which was negative
for pathogens.
7 urine cultures were performed throughout the hospitalization
which were all negative. Patient did have some urinary retention
but did not wish to have Foley catheter. Encouraged to urinate
on a scheduled basis.
Patients' temperature ranged from 100.8-104.1 with some element
of fever up until 3 days prior to discharge when it was Tmax of
98.9. Patient was switched from IV antibiotics, Vanco (20 days)
and Meropenem (10 days) to PO Fluconazole and Augmentin on [**10-25**], which will be continued for one week post hospitalization.
Patient had a mild bump in amylase/lipase on [**11-1**], however
repeat labwork later in the day was much improved. Blood sugars
77-144 throughout the entire hospitalization.
U/S of pancreas on [**11-1**] showed that the pancreas was well seen
on ultrasound and shows no evidence of edema. No fluid or
collections around the pancreas are seen.
There is normal arterial and venous blood flow identified in all
areas.
Patient to discharge home with labwork on [**11-4**] and followup
visit with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 816**] next Monday [**11-8**].
