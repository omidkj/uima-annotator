Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Cath with pulmonary edema

1)Diagnostic Cardiac Catheterization
2)Cardiac Catheterization s/p Left Circumflex and Left Main
Coronary Stenting and Right Coronary Angioplasty


History of Present Illness:
84 yo M w/ Cerebral palsy, mild MR, seizure d/o, sCHF, recent
echo showed worsening MR, mod pulm HTN, and biventricular
dysfunction.  Patient had catheterization today showing diffuse
CAD with elevated PCWP and pulmonary edema. History obtained
from patient, group home manager, and medical records. Patient
has some occasional shortness of breath that does not appear to
be associated with exertion. Also has occasional cough with mild
sputum production. Denies orthopnea, PND, recent chest pain.
Group home manager agrees with patient's history. Patient denies
diarrhea or constipation, nausea or vomiting, or changes in
weight.

Patient was seen in [**Month (only) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of c/o
exertional chest pain and was treated medically. Patient was
also admitted for chest pain in [**2-5**] when ruled out for MI. ECHO
done on [**2127-6-26**] showed Severe biventricular hypokinesis c/w
diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.).
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. It showed worsening function in comparison
to ECHO in [**11-6**]. Cardiac perfusion imaging done in [**11-6**] showed
no new or reversible perfusion defects. Stable fixed perfusion
defects involving distal anterior, apex and septum and worsening
hypokinesis and left ventricular cavity dilatation. LVEF=28%.

In cath, CO was 4.17 with CI of 2.69. PA sat of 60%, PCWP of 40
with RA pressure of 15. LAD was occluded, LMCA 60% ostial
occlusion and 80% mid. LCX 80% mid and RCA occluded. Patient was
given Lasix 40mg IV and admitted to the CCU for aggressive
diuresis.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2127-7-23**]

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right-dominant
systems
demonstrated severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The
LMCA had
a 60% ostial stenosis and an 80% mid-segment stenosis.  The LAD
was
occluded.  The LCx had an 80% mid-segment stenosis.  The RCA was
also
occluded.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 11 mmHg.  There was severe
pulmonary
arterial hypertension with a PA systolic pressure of 88 mmHg;
however,
this must be interpreted in the context and severe left-sided
volume
overload with a mean baseline PCWP of 40 mmHg.  There is mild
systemic
systolic arterial hypertension with an SBP of 139 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe left sided volume overload.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
4. Mild systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
5. Admitted to CCU for diuresis and surgical consultation.

COMMENTS:
US guided access of B/l femoral arteries and right femoral vein
Transseptal puncture and LHC. LA with marked V waves.
Tandem heart initiated with hemodynamic support.
Coronary Angiogram:

RCA: occluded mid
Successful PTCA/Stenting of LMCA with PROMUS 3.0 X 23 mm DES at
20 atms
Successful PTCA/stenting of mid LCX with PROMUS 3.0 X 15 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 103322**] of prox/mid RCA with 2.0 X 40 mm Apex Rx balloon at 4-8
atms.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful drug eluting stenting of LMCA and LCx arteries
using
Tandem Heart support.

 CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2127-7-24**] 8:08 AM

IMPRESSION:

1. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.

2. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis, pleural fluid
or pneumonia,
if clinically appropriate.

3. Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.

4. Large hiatal hernia, unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1024**] is a 84 year old male with Cerebral palsy, mild MR,
seizure d/o, systolic CHF, with recent echocardiogram showing
worsening Mitral Regurg, mod pulm HTN, and biventricular
dysfunction.  Patient had catheterization today showing diffuse
CAD with elevated PCWP and pulmonary edema.

# Systolic Heart Failure: Patient has low EF and elevated PCWP.
Patient denied symptoms; however, his exam was positive for
diffuse crackles with decreased breath sounds at bases and
elevated JVP. He had adequate oxygen saturations on 2L NC, and
his BP was stable. He was fluid o
