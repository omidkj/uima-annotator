History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 86746**] is a 62 year old female with stage T3 N1 signet
ring adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus who recently
completed induction chemotherapy.  Since that time she has had a
PET scan for repeat staging which showed persistent upper
mediastinal adenopathy, and head MRI revealing a suprasellar
lesion that was biopsied by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and found to be
consistent with a benign cyst.  Biopsy of the  mediastinal nodes
revealed only non-necrotizing granulomas with no evidence for
metastasis.  Therefore she is admitted today for planned
esophagogastrectomy.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal with thoracic epidural.

INDICATIONS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 86746**] is a 62-year-old woman with biopsy-
proven T3, N1, stage III carcinoma of the distal esophagus
with lymph nodes that were PET-positive extending well up
into the superior thorax. She has been treated with induction
chemoradiotherapy with an objective response. Residual PET-
positive lymph nodes were evaluated thoracoscopically and
with mediastinoscopy and were found to be sarcoidal. Without
evidence of disease progression, I recommended resection and
she agreed to proceed.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the
operating room after the insertion of a thoracic epidural
catheter. She underwent the uneventful induction of general
endotracheal anesthesia. A pediatric bronchoscope was used to
examine the central airways. The distal trachea was normal.
The main carina was sharp, and the segmental branching
pattern of the lungs was unremarkable. No endobronchial
purulence, tumor, or blood was noted to the subsegmental
level. A left-sided double-lumen endotracheal tube was
positioned above the left lobar carina, and the bronchoscope
was removed.

The upper GI endoscope was used to assess for residual
endoluminal tumor. There was what appeared to be a healed
bland ulcer in the distal esophagus, at the site of the
former tumor. This extended to the GE junction. The stomach
was entered, and the rugal folds distended normally. There
was no visualized tumor along the lesser curvature using a
retroflexed view of the GE junction. The gastric antrum was
not deformed. The pylorus was widely patent. The duodenum was
normal to its second portion. The scope was then removed.

The patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus
position, and the right chest was prepped and draped as a
single sterile field. A standard serratus-sparing lateral
thoracotomy was made, and the chest was entered through the
sixth intercostal space. A 0-silk suture was placed in the
dome of the diaphragm to retract it inferiorly and improve
exposure. Circumferential dissection of the esophagus was
then carried out beginning in the subcarinal space. The
esophagus was looped with a Penrose drain and dissected free
of its mediastinal attachments down to the crura of the
diaphragm inferiorly. Subcarinal lymph nodes were sampled,
and one was submitted to pathology, which showed only a
hyalinized nodule. The balance was submitted as level VII
lymph nodes. The subcarinal space was entirely mobilized down
to the pericardium and to both main stem bronchi laterally.
Paraesophageal nodes in the inferior ligament and at level
VIII were included with the specimen. The esophagus was then
carefully separated from the membranous airway as we
dissected cephalad. The azygos vein had previously been
divided during the lymph node evaluation. Above the azygos
vein, we dissected directly on the longitudinal muscle of the
esophagus to attempt to avoid injury to the recurrent nerves.
This was continued up to the thoracic apex and well into the
neck. A small Penrose drain was knotted around the specimen
and passed into the neck for subsequent retrieval. Hemostasis
was achieved with the cautery. The inferior pulmonary
ligament was completely mobilized. Palpation of the lung
revealed no nodules.

The region of the thoracic duct was doubly ligated with 0-silk
sutures by mass ligating all the tissues between the periosteum
of the spine and the adventitia of the aorta, including the
azygos vein. Two of these were placed.

The chest was then drained with a 28-French chest tube passed
posteriorly and apically through a separate stab wound
inferiorly. It was secured to the skin with heavy suture and
connected to a Pleur-Evac with an underwater seal. The ribs
were then reapproximated with #1-Vicryl pericostal sutures.
The lung was reinflated. The muscular chest was closed in
layers with absorbable suture, and the skin was closed in the
subcuticular fashion. Steri-Strips and dry dressings were
applied.

The patient was returned to the supine position and
reintubated with a single-lumen endotracheal tube. She was
positioned supine with a roll between her scapulae and the
head turned right. She was prepped from the left ear to the
pubis, and 2 fields were created - one over the left neck and
one over the abdomen.

A midline abdominal incision was made, and the peritoneum was
entered through the linea [**Female First Name (un) **]. Inspection revealed no
ascites. There was no studding of the omentum. There were no
nodules palpated in the liver. There was thickening at the GE
junction and no gross adenopathy along the left gastric
artery. The small bowel was run from the ileocecal valve up
approximately to the level of the jejunostomy and there were
no lesions. The proximal bowel also was normal to palpation
from the jejunostomy to the ligament of Treitz. There were no
colonic abnormalities palpated, and no pathology was noted in
the pelvis.

The [**Doctor Last Name 634**]-[**Doctor Last Name 37393**] retractor and the [**Last Name (un) 34391**] were placed.
