Service:  CA/TH [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 -year-old male
with a history of colon cancer.  He is status post resection
with colostomy, followed by colostomy take down three months
ago, as well as a remote history of seizure disorder well
controlled with Dilantin, who complained of a stuttering
course of chest pain times 48 hours prior to admission at
[**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2127-12-19**].  The patient had a questionable
history of transient ischemic attack.

His electrocardiogram on admission at 05:45 PM at [**Hospital **]
Hospital showed acute ST segment depressions between C1
through V5, as well as aortic valve replacement and AVL.  He
had ST segment elevations in II, III, AVF, as well as left
axis deviation and a first degree A-V block and multiple
atrial premature contractions and premature ventricular
contractions.  He was given no thrombolytic course due to his
questionable history of transient ischemic attack in the past
and was therefore transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for an urgent cardiac catheterization.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  His admitting medications included
aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin, heparin bolus and drip,
nitroglycerin drip at 20 mcg, and was pain free prior to
transfer.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While on the catheterization table, he did
develop chest pain at [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
During the catheterization he was found to have pulmonary
capillary wedge mean pressure of 28, a right atrial pressure
of 8.0, aortic pressures of 195/98 with a mean of 135,
pulmonary artery pressure of 57/26 with a mean of 37, right
ventricular pressure of 45/8 with a mean of 12, and there was
also evidence of significant mitral regurgitation that was
suspected.  He had a left dominant system that showed the
left main coronary artery as being normal, his left anterior
descending as an 80% distal occlusion, distal stenosis at the
level of second diagonal, as well as 90% diffusely disease to
the proximal first diagonal.

He had a left circumflex lesion that was 50% proximal
stenosis and then he received a percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty to a 70% stenosed first obtuse marginal
artery, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty showed good flow as well as 100% cut off in the
PL branch, consistent with a thrombus.  This additionally was
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied.  There is
also evidence of a right coronary artery with a 90% mid
lesion.  Due to the significant three vessel disease and left
anterior descending disease, he was put on [**Last Name (LF) 37318**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, he was given aspirin
and ACE inhibitors.  He was placed on the COOL M1 protocol
and then Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted.

On hospital day two, [**2127-12-20**], the patient received an
echocardiogram, revealing an ejection fraction of 40%, 1+
mitral regurgitation, 1+ aortic regurgitation.  Additionally
by this point, the patient had had multiple runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with stable blood
pressures while being maintained on intra-aortic balloon
pump.  His ventricular ectopy was undoubtedly related to
ischemia.  As a consequence, the patient was consulted to
Electrophysiology who opted to hold off on studying the
patient until after he had been revascularized.

Cardiac Surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ultimately took the patient
to the Operating Room on [**2127-12-22**].  His preoperative
hematocrit was 29.  He had a BUN and creatinine of 24 and
1.3.  His chest x-ray shows no infiltrate, no effusion, no
pulmonary edema.  He had normal coagulation profile except
for a PTT of 60 as he was being heparinized for his ischemic
episode.  His cardiac enzymes were CPK trends of 653, 1,124,
and 1,351 with MB fractions of 43, 130, and 190.  Troponin I
fractions were 6.6, 11.6, and 14.1, all consistent with an
acute myocardial infarction along the inferior system.

On [**2127-12-22**], he went to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11743**] and he underwent a four vessel coronary artery
bypass graft, including left internal mammary artery to the
diagonal, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to second obtuse marginal artery, and a
saphenous vein graft to the right posterior descending
artery.  Indications were unstable angina, low ejection
fraction, and myocardial infarction.  His bypass time was 91
minutes with a cross clamp times 75 minutes.  His pericardium
was left open and he left the Operating Room with a radial
A-line and a Swan-Ganz catheter as well as a right femoral
intra-aortic balloon pump.  He had two ventricular and two
atrial pacing wires, two mediastinal chest tubes, and one
left pleural tube.

He was taken intubated to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit
where he was extubated on the night of surgery.  He remained
neurologically intact.  Respiratory wise he was doing well,
was extubated, had good gas exchange. His chest tubes were
left for high outputs of 600 and 250 respectively.  He did
have a temperature of 101.3 F, but his white count was 8,000.
He did have a hematocrit of 23 and his BUN and creatinine
were 17 and 1.1.  His arterial blood gas on 40% face mask was
7.45, 34, 67, unlabored.

He received two units of packed red blood cells, his
intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned off.  By postoperative
day two he remained neurologically intact.  Cardiovascular
wise he had frequent ectopy with runs of what looked like
atrial fibrillation and was therefore placed on amiodarone
empirically.  It was rate controlled in the 60s.  I
additionally had evidence of multiple premature ventricular
complexes.  His mediastinal chest tubes were removed on
postoperative day two and his left pleural tube was left in
place.  His BUN and creatinine remained stable at 25 and 1.1
with a hematocrit of 33.  Infectious Disease wise he had no
issues.  He was transferred to the floor by postoperative day
two.

On postoperative day three the patient remained stable;
however, was having frequent ectopy with premature
ventricular contractions and possible premature atrial
contractions, question premature atrial contractions versus
atrial fibrillation.  Electrophysiology was consulted
subsequently.  Electrophysiology felt that certainly beta
blockade and electrolyte repletion were appropriate for this
patient.  He was maintained on amiodarone although he
continued to have ectopy.  As a consequence, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the Electrophysiology service noted that on
postoperative day three the patient should receive a
sinoatrial node electrocardiogram to assess for latent
potential as well as to do a formal electrophysiologic study
evaluation to see if there is any inducible ventricular
tachycardia.

The patient's chest tubes were removed at this time.  He was
out of bed, ambulating with Physical Therapy, and was started
on a low dose beta blocker of 12.5 mg of Lopressor [**Hospital1 **].  By
[**2127-12-26**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] took the patient to the
Catheterization Lab where the patient was found to have a
positive sinoatrial node electrocardiogram showing A-V nodal
irreentrant tachycardia that could be induced, as well as an
inducible ventricular tachycardia and was therefore given an
ICV internal cardiac defibrillator device.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and on postoperative day four
was discharged back to the Far Six Floor Recovery Unit.

By postoperative day five, the patient began complaining of
some loose stools which was thought to be secondary to his
previous history of colon resection, typically took some
Imodium and was therefore started back on his Imodium.  His
hematocrit at this time was 29 with a BUN and creatinine of
27 and 1.3.  His electrolytes were repleted accordingly.
Neurologically he was alert and oriented ti
