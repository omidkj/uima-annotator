Imaging
[**9-16**] CXR
PORTABLE CHEST:  [**2198-9-16**].

HISTORY:  55-year-old man with shortness of breath and acute
hypoxia.

FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to
previous exam from
[**2198-9-11**].  Compared to prior, there has been interval
improvement of
aeration at the lung bases.  There are some persistent bibasilar
opacities,
right greater than left.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable
as are the
osseous and soft tissue structures.

IMPRESSION:  Mild interval improvement in the previously seen
bibasilar
opacities which persist.  These could be due to resolving
infiltrates or
atelectasis or potentially aspiration.

[**9-16**] CT head

FINDINGS:  There is no acute intra-axial or extra-axial
hemorrhage, mass,
midline shift, or territorial infarct.  Right occipital lobe
encephalomalacia
as well as regions of encephalomalacia centered in the right
middle cerebellar
peduncle are again seen.  Global volume loss of the cerebellum
is again noted.
Elsewhere, [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.

There is partial opacification of the inferior right mastoid air
cells.
Mucous retention cyst seen in the right maxillary sinus.  Other
paranasal
sinuses and left mastoids are clear.  The skull and extracranial
soft tissues
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial process.  Encephalomalacia within the
right occipital
lobe and right middle cerebellar peduncle, unchanged from prior

[**2198-9-17**]
TTE: Poor image quality.The left atrium is normal in size. No
atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
