Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
75 yo woman with polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], melanoma, prior DVT here
with progressive weakness and fatigue, no other focal complaints
.
Pt was seen in ED [**1-13**] for abdominal pain where RUQ u/s showed
gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis. Surgery evaluated
pt who recommended HIDA scan, which also did not show
cholecystitis.  INR at that time was 4.1.
.
Since that time, she has had progressive weakness and fatigue
and has undergone extensive outpatient workup including labs,
echo, ct of chest, abd, pelvis to assess the concerns of
recurrent melenoma.  Labs have demonstrated a decline of hct
from 41 on [**1-13**] to 34 on [**1-28**], to 28 today.  Patient reports
weakness has been progressing slowly, but is now at a point
where she can no longer walk without assistance of her husband.
She reports decreased PO intake over the past week, no POs today
as she has "no appetite", feeling "dry", and having a nosebleed
this morning.  She feels slightly short of breath.  She has not
noticed any blood in her bowel movements, denies any f/c/n/v,
cp, palpitations, falls, cough, visual changes, mental status
changes, confusion, headache, dysuria.  She has noted increasing
bilateral edema over the past week. Abdominal pain largely
resolved unless abdomen is palpated.


Past Medical History:
PmHx:
(1) Thromboembolism.
(2) She has a previous h/o polyp [**2160**]. Repeat screening
colonoscopy [**2165-8-21**] showed a hyperplastic polyp.
(3) Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]. Before starting 6-MP, had been on
hydroxyurea (complicated by erratic platelet counts,
necessitating
a change in antimetabolite therapy in 11/00). not required
therapeutic phlebotomy for control of polycythemia since [**2165-8-14**]

(4)[**2162**], ALTs to 75-100, with normal ASTs and alk
phos levels.presumably relates to 6-MP.
(5) s/p wide excision of in-situ melanoma associated with her
invasive stage IIB melanoma of the left leg. The latter was
widely excised on [**2164-2-16**] with sentinel lymph node biopsy.
(stage IIB). declined interferon-alfa (IFA) for adjuvant therapy
of her melanoma
(6) DVT in the past. 3+ times,no history of arterial thrombosis.

(7). Hypertension.
(8). Glaucoma.
(9). Status post total abdominal hysterectomy for fibroids.
(10). Status post appendectomy
.

Abd; abdominal scars noted.  NABS, slight pain to palp RUQ, no

EKG:  NSR, 100,nl axis, PR prolonged  250ms (unchanged from
prior in [**2164**]), no st changes.
.
[**2-5**]: RUQ US: Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute
cholecystitis. Small right pleural effusion.
.
[**2166-1-28**] CT chest, abd, pelvis: At least three tiny noncalcified
pulmonary nodules within the right middle lobe. Given the
patient's history of melanoma, a three-month follow-up
examination is recommended to insure stability.; Dense coronary
artery calcifications; Small bilateral pleural effusions;
Splenomegaly; ) Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis; Small
amount of free fluid within the pelvis.

[**2-5**]: Pelvic CT wet read:no discrete retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
increased free fluid in abd. and pelvis, and bilat pleural
effusions and subcutaneous tissue..
.
[**2166-1-31**]: Echo:The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF> 55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Anemia: Unclear cause. Hct had been trending down over the
past few weeks prior to admission. There was great concern for
bleed with elevated INR, but CT showed no evidence of RP bleed.
Throughout hospital course, all guaiacs negative.
Pt seen by hematology oncology. Lab tests did not show any
indication of mircoangiopatic hemolytic anemia on peripheral
smear, nor was there any evidence of DIC. Hematocrit remained
fairly stable, however, the elavated LDH and concurrent lactic
acidosis was thought to be secondary to the rapid cell turnover.
Bone marrow biopsy showed 2+ PMNs on the gram stain, but no
orgs. Pt was given Fe supplementation during hosptial stay.

2. Thrombocytopenia/left shift: Platelet count low with
concerning etiology of infection vs. malignancy. Peripheral
smear "toxic" appearing but left shift resolving. Platelet
counts followed closely with low threshold to transfuse.

3. INR elevation: Baselin INR 4. INR peaked in the hospital at
41. No evidence of bleed on CT. Guiac negative in ED. Fall
precautions.  Received 2 U FFP, and SC and IV vitamin K in ED.

4. Acidosis: gap: Multiple possible etiologies.  Patient has had
elevated glucose since [**Month (only) 1096**], elevated now with decreased PO
intake, however serum acetone was negative.  Urine ketones,
serum acitone negative. Serum ASA negative. Appeared to be
lactic acidosis and probable renal failure contributing.
Hypoalbumin may have masked size of anion gap.
IN the MICU, pt continued to have high Lactate, with noted
consolidation on CXR. Pt was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics, with strict glycemic control.

4.5. Respiratory failure secondary to hypoxia. Increased A-a
gradient. The differential diagnosis was broad upon admission to
the MICU, including worsening PNA, viral or bacterial with
special consideration of influenza, as the leading causes, not
excluding TRALI. Given patient's hx and likel
