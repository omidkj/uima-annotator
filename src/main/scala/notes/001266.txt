History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year old Russian speaking female with
diastolic CHF and several recent admissions for heart failure
exacerbations, who presented to the ED today with pre-syncope.
She was discharged home yesterday, [**2121-9-21**], after being
effectively diuresed with a lasix drip. This morning her VNA
nurse came to the house. As she got up to open the door, the
patient fainted and the VNA nurse caught her. She was put in a
chair and immediately awoke. She did not have any chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. The VNA nurse took the
patient's blood pressure, which was reportedly very low, and she
was brought to the ED in an ambulance.
.
During her last admission, in addition to treatment for a heart
failure exacerbation, she was also worked up for restricitve
cardiomyopathy. She had monoclonal bands in her unrine and her
serum, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed as part of the
workup for restrictive cardiomyopathy. An oncology consult was
obtained. The other working diagnosis had been aymloidosis, but
the bone marrow biopsy results were going to be analyzed before
investigating amyloid disease.
.
While VNA was at her home, the patient stood up this morning and
her blood pressure decreased dramatically to 60/palpation,
resulting in near syncope. She was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
this reason.
.
In the ED her blood pressure was 92/65, HR 74, RR 18, saturating
98% on 4L NC. She recieved 500cc of iv fluids. She looked dry on
exam. Her hematocrit was 36, up from 31. She is being admitted
to [**Hospital1 1516**] for observation.
.
When she came to the floor, she did not have any dizziness and
she was hemodynamically stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
HYPOTENSION/CHF: JVD, distant heart sounds, low voltage on EKG,
enlarged RA and LA, lower extremity edema, pulm edema on CXR,
suggest congestive heart failure,  possibly restrictive in
nature. Pt's bone marrow path results returned positive for MM
and CLL. Amyloidosis also of consideration in this patient with
renal failure, monoclonal spike, anemia, possible restrictive
HF. The patient's pre-syncopal episode was likely due to
orthostatic hypotension. Pt was given gentle fluid boluses
initially. Pt had brief episode of hypotension on the floor and
was briefly started on Levophed. She was transfered to the CCU
for close monitoring. In the CCU, Levophed was d/c-ed, and pt
stabalized with lasix gtt. Over the next few days, several
liters of fluid was removed. She appeared significantly more
euvolemic on exam. Pt's "air hunger" and SOB was treated
symptomatically with lasix and morphine.
.
# Multiple Myeloma/CLL: Bone marrow biopsy report returned
positive for MM and CLL. It did not reveal amyloidosis but that
does not conclusively rule out the diagnosis. Oncology team
notified patient and family and did not reccomend any
therapeutic treatment given her poor performance status,
multi-organ failure. Palliative care was consulted and met with
family and patient to discuss goals of care. Decision was made
to make patient DNR/DNI and to focus on goals of comfort.
Patient was given morphine for air-hunger and continued on lasix
drip for symptoms of heart failure.
.
# CORONARIES: No EKG changes consistent with acute ischemia. No
chest pain. Troponin leak likely due to combination of demand
ischemia and chronic kidney disease resulting in decreased
troponin clearance. Troponin steady since admission. Continued
ASA, atorvastatin. Atorvastatin was discontinued on [**9-24**] after
palliative care family meeting.
.
# RHYTHM: Pt with first degree AV nodal block on EKG on
admission. EKG during hypotensive episode was bradycardic.
Patient had short runs of unsustained VT (5-10 beats) few times
daily. Metoprolol tartrate was started at 6.25mg TID, but was
frequently held due to low BP. Transitioned to toprol 12.5mg.
.
# CKD: Cr. baseline 1.0 in [**6-/2121**], 1.4-1.5 in [**7-/2121**], now
1.8-1.9. On this admission creatinine is 2.1-2.2 range. Cr has
been gradually trending up over the last few months. Bence [**Doctor Last Name 49**]
proteins found in urine on prior admission. Patient likely has
pre-renal azotemia from heart failure complicated with
underlying renal insuficiency from MM/Amyloid.
.
# Hyperlipidemia- Continued home atorvastatin.
.
# GERD- Continued home PPI.
.
# Goals of Care: Heme/Onc did not feel that there were any
therapeutic options for patient's MM/CLL/Possible amyloid.
Palliative care was consulted and helped family make decisions
about end of life care. Patient was made DNR/DNI with a focus on
comfort. She was given morphine 0.5mg-2mg for SOB and air-hunger
symptoms. Patient eventually passed with her daughter at the
bedside.
