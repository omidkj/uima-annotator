Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2210-8-18**] Endotracheal Intubation
[**2210-8-19**] Bedside MICU Bronchoscopy
Right internal jugular central catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10029**] is a 45 year old female with cerebral palsy with
chronic indwelling Foley for urinary retention, recurrent
aspiration pneumonia with multiple intubations and tracheostomy
(now reversed), history of complex partial seizure (right facial
twitching), s/p PEG tube and non-verbal (other than yes-no) who
was doing well at her Bay Cove Human Services until ten days
ago.  She has had nasal congestion, cough and sneezing for past
ten days with new shortness of breath and difficulty with
breathing and lethargy noted yesterday morning along fever of
101.3 which led to [**Hospital1 18**] ED admission.

In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7, 81/43, 91, 26, O2Sat
95%4LNC. Labs are notable for WBC 16.4, Hgb 13.8, Plt 201,
Neutrophils 89.6%, normal CHEM 7, normal coagulation panel,
normal LFTs, negative ASA, serum acetaminophen 6, lactate 1.4,
ABG 7.41/42/51/28, UA + for small leuk and few bacteria but 0
epi and neg nitr, and UCG negative. She had left IJ placed due
to difficult access. CXR confirmed location of the line and
retrocardiac opacity. Patient received 750 mg IV levofloxacin,
500 mg IV metronidazole, and total of 2250 mL of IVF. Patient
had 850 mL of urine output. Nursing was able to suction
secretion and patient is able to cough per nursing report. VS
upon transfer 99F, 113/75, 19, O2Sat 100% RA.

On the floor, she was continued on levaquin/flagyl. She was
noted to have fever again along with worsening oxygen
requirement this morning requiring nonrebreather.  ABG showed
7.43/33/89. CXR showed worsening left lung opacity +/- effusion.
 She was given IV vancomycin and ordered for cepepime (not
given) and transferred to MICU for increased work of breathing
and impending intubation.

In the MICU, she was intubated without any complications and
sedation with fentanyl/versed.

MICRO:
Sputum Cx Respiratory Flora
Blood Cx x2 negative, pending x1
Legionella negative
Urine Cx negative

ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. Possible prior inferior wall myocardial
infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2208-10-18**] no diagnostic
interval change.

IMAGING:
CXR [**8-17**]
IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity, similar to [**2208-10-18**],
which may
represent aspiration in the correct clinical setting.

CXR [**8-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  There is spinal hardware in place.  The patient is markedly
rotated on the current examination, which limits evaluation of
the cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There does appear to be
an increasing opacity overlying the left hemithorax, which has
the appearance more likely of layering pleural fluid.
Underlying airspace diseas such as aspiration or pneumonia
cannot be excluded on this limited examination.  Clinical
correlation is advised to help explain the apparent increase in
left pleural effusion and left airspace disease.  The visualized
right lung appears grossly clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  A
right internal jugular central line remains in position with its
tip in the
distal SVC.  No pneumothorax.

CXR [**8-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Spinal hardware is again seen obscuring some of the detail.
A right
internal jugular central line continues to have its tip
unchanged in position likely in the distal SVC.  An endotracheal
tube is in position with its tip approximately 2 cm above the
carina.  Once again, the patient is markedly rotated left
