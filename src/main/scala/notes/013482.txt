HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 70 year old
woman who was admitted on [**4-7**], status post a right
frontal hemorrhage with midline shift. She had had previous
clipping of an unruptured right MCA aneurysm 8 years ago in
elective fashion at an outside institution. The patient was taken
emergently to the Operating Room on [**2201-4-7**] for evacuation
of sylvian fissure hematoma which led to herniation syndrome with
a blown pupil in the ED. She subsequently underwent cerebral
angiography which showed that she had a large MCA aneurysm
recurrence/regrowth under the clip blades.  Accordingly, on [**2201-4-8**], she was taken back to the Operating Room for clipping
of a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.  She had a vent drain
placed on [**4-10**] and an angio on [**4-11**], that showed good
placement of the clip. The previous clip could not be removed
because it had fused to the tissue.  She was intubated in an
outside hospital for transport to [**Hospital6 2018**].  She was awake and alert preintubation.  On arrival to
the Emergency Room she was withdrawing her lower extremities,
flexor posturing her upper extremities with no eye opening.  She
had serratia in her blood and sputum on [**4-14**] and fungus in
her blood on [**4-14**].  Postoperative neurologically the
patient's pupils were equal and reactive, she had localized
stimulation on the right, flexors on the left.  She continued to
be followed by the Infectious Disease Service for serratia and
fungus in her blood.  She was on Kefzol, Levofloxacin and
Fluconazole for intravenous antibiotic coverage.  On [**2201-4-28**],
for neurologic status she withdrew her arm with noxious
stimulation.  Her left arm appeared to be posturing.
Bilateral toes were positive Babinski, opening eyes
occasionally with noxious stimulation, did not follow
commands and did not track with her eyes.  Spontaneous
movement of the right arm only.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Vent drain was leveled at 10 cm above the
tragus and opened to drainage.  She had multiple surveillance
cultures sent, and her cerebrospinal fluid came back
negative.  On her second craniotomy, she did have her
craniectomy as well as craniotomy and her flap remained full
and soft.  Her dressing was clean, dry and intact.  She had a
tracheostomy placement on [**2201-4-29**] without complications,
and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed at the same
time.  She had a repeat head computerized tomography scan on
[**2197-4-30**] which showed minimal subacute left frontal fluid
and no new hemorrhage or mass effect.  On [**2201-5-8**], the
patient was responding to voice, squeezing of the right hand.
Her flap was soft, and she continued to have a hemiparesis on
her left side.  [**2201-5-15**], the patient was taken to the
Operating Room for replacement of craniectomy.  There was no
intraoperative complications.  She also had a right
ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed.  Postoperative vital signs
were stable.  She was afebrile.  She was awake, responding to
commands on the right side.  Her incision was clean, dry and
intact.  She remained neurologically stable and was
transferred to the regular floor on [**2201-5-17**].  She
remains neurologically stable, following commands on the
right side.  Her dressing is clean, dry and intact.  Her head
computerized tomography scan on [**5-18**], showed good placement
of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt with effacement of the
lateral ventricle.  She continued to be assessed by physical
therapy and occupational therapy and was found to require
acute rehabilitation.
