Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: Nausea/Vomitting/Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP w/ sphincterotomy


History of Present Illness:
80yo male w/CAD, DM, and CHF who has a h/o of hepatic
encephalopathy who presented to an OSH w/ N/V/Abd pain that the
day proir to admission. At OSH, he was found to have an amylase
of [**2110**] and an AlkPhos of 700 w/a TotalBili 5.3. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up of his LFT
abnormalities and for mental status changes.
.
In the ED here his LFTs were confirmed and an u/s shared a
mildly dilated CBD without any GB wall thickening or edema. A CT
scan was ordered to evaluate for portal vein thrombosis, which
was subsequently found to be negative. He was stable until 10pm
at which point he became hypotensive with systolic BPs in the
70's. He was bolused with 6 liters NS, but his BPs did not
respond so a central line was placed and pressors were started.
An ERCP was performed revealing multiple stones which were
removed, with post cholangiogram which was free of stones. We
was weaned off pressors, and evaluated by surgery who felt
cholecystectomy is indicated once he is medically stabilized.
.
On tranfer the patient felt well and was without symptoms. He
denied abdominal pain, and had been able to tolerate PO's
without complaint. He noted 2 recent BM's. On ROS, he does
relate ~50 lb weight loss over the past 7 months, which he
relates to his 'water pills.'

ERCP [**2116-4-9**] - A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12
o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing
guidewire; a balloon was used to sweep the duct which expelled
multiple stones and stone fragments. After stone removal a
cholangiogram revealed a duct free of stones
Impression: 1. A bulging of the major papilla suggestive of an
impacted stone. 2. There was a filling defect seen in the distal
biliary tree suggestive of an stone. 3. A sphincterotomy was
performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over
an existing guidewire. 4. A balloon was used to sweep the duct
which expelled multiple stones and stone fragments.
5. After stone removal a cholangiogram revealed a duct free of
stones.

CTA ABD W&W/O C - [**2116-4-9**] - IMPRESSION:
1) Mild Pancreatitis, 2) Cholelithiasis, without evidence of
acute cholecystitis, 3) Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
Pericolic fluid is most likely due to underlying liver disease,
4) Lesion in segment VI of liver which has been noted on prior
ultrasounds from [**2115-12-28**], and [**2115-12-24**]. This is
an arterio-portal fistula
with refluxing contrast down the portal vein. The findings are
concerning for a mass in the liver causing this fistula. Because
of this, an MRI is once again recommended to evaluate the
vasculature and in particular, to exclude an underlying liver
malignancy. 5) All intrahepatic arteries, veins and the portal
vein are patent without
intraluminal thrombus. 6) Splenic infarcts.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2116-4-13**] 3:40 PM -
CONCLUSION:
Findings are consistent with cirrhosis and an arteriovenous
fistula. No definite vascularized portal venous tumor thrombus
is identified, and the peripheral RPV thrombus hence appears on
imaging to be bland thrombus. However, although no focal hepatic
mass is identified apart from the AV fistula, the patient's
alpha fetoprotein is noted to be markedly elevated and the
possibility of tumor thrombus cannot definitively be excluded.
As the patient cannot get an MRI and there is no definable
target for biopsy, consideration for a PET-CT study should be
given.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2116-4-13**] 3:40 PM - IMPRESSION:
Findings suggestive of partial, nonocclusive thrombus in the
right common femoral vein, which may be chronic or acute.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo male c/CAD, CHF, DM, CRF and cryptogenic cirrhosis who is
admitted for obstructive pancreatitis and jaundice now s/p ERCP
.
RESOLVING SEPSIS - appears resolved, BP became stable with good
CVP's. Pt was briefly placed on Zosyn, which was then d/c'd with
continued stable BP and negative cultures.
.
GALLSTONE PANCREATITIS - s/p ERCP, and was able to tolerate PO
diet without complaint. His enzymes continued to trend down. Pt
was felt to be a high risk surgery for [**Last Name (LF) 10259**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] no inpatient
surgery was planned. This may be re-addressed as an outpatient.
.
CV: CORONARIES - pt has known CAD, with allergy to ASA (unclear
if true allergy). [**Month (only) 116**] benifit from repeat stress as an
outpatient.
    PUMP - pt with known CHF, but continued to have stable O2
sats. He was restarted on his outpt diuretics.
    RATE - he was restarted on his outpatient Diltiazem for
Afib, as well as Digoxin. He was temporarily placed on IV
Heparin, but Coumadin was held b/o history of GIB, and well as
fall history. Coumadin was held during previous admission, and
his PCP's office was contact[**Name (NI) **]. It was agreed that we should
continue holding his Coumadin, and this could be further
evaluated as an outpatient.
.
DVT - it was noted by radiology that he may have a possible RUE
dvt on his abdominal CT. Follow-up US confirmed nonocclusive
thrombus. Given previously discussed risks, he was not treated
with Coumadin. These risks were discussed with the patient and
family.
.
ANEMIA - pt w/ h/o GIB, with only grade 1 varices. He was mildly
guiac positive while on Heparin, and recieved 1U of PRBC's with
Hct corrected to baseline. He should have f/u Hct checks.
.
DM - his prevous NPH regimen was held, and was covered with ISS.
He should restart a lower NPH regimen as outpatient, and cover
with ISS.
.
HTN - his ACEi was held, and he was placed back on Diltiazem for
rate c
