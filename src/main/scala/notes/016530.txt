Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
direct admit for CHF and pulmonary hypertension management


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tunneled central venous catheter placement
flolan titration.


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 49 year old with hx of lupus, pulmonary hypertension, RV
enlargement and failure and an ASD who is being admitted for
management of CHF/pulm HTN. The patient has had progressively
worsening dyspnea over the past one year. She has noticed
diminished exercise tolerance. Was able to climb the stairs in
her home without difficulty. Now she becomes dyspnea. Also
becomes dyspneic when ambulating on flat ground. Occasionally
notices a sensation of pressure across chest and arms. Pt was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1016**] in cardiology on [**11-25**] for evaluation. As
part of his work-up the pt had a TTE which demonstarted moderate
to severe pulmonary hypertension, markedly dilated right
ventricle and R to L shunting c/w an ASD/PFO. A p-MIBI
demosnstrated a markedly increased right ventricular cavity size
with severe global hypokinesis with evidence of right-sied
pressure and volume overload. The patient is to be admitted to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 for further evaluation of the pt's pulm HTN and
management of her CHF.

Pertinent Results:
echo [**2154-12-26**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. A  right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest after  contrast injection consistent with and
ASD/PFO. Left ventricular wall  thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small.  Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is  markedly dilated. There is severe global right
ventricular free wall  hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The  aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally  normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is moderate to severe  pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. Markedly
dilated right ventricle. Severe right ventricular dysfunction.
Right to left shunting across  interatrial septum at rest c/w
ASD/PFO.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal myocardial perfusion.
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
3. Markedly increase right ventricular cavity size with severe
global hypokinesis with evidence of right-sied pressure and
volume overload

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: 49 year old with hx of lupus, pulmonary
hypertension, RV enlargement and failure and an ASD who is being
admitted for management of CHF and treatment of pulmonary artery
hypertension.
.
While in the CCU, the patient underwent a R heart cath which
showed: 1.Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left
sided pressures
(mean RA pressure was 5mmHg, mean PCWP was 9mmHg). There was
severe
pulmonary hypertension (mean PAP was 50mmHg, PVR 667
(dyne*sec)/cm5).
CArdiac index was normal at 2.4L/min/m2.
2.With 100% O2 therapy alone, the mean PAP was 41mmHg with PVR
553
(dyne*sec)/cm5.
3.With 100% O2 and Nitric Oxide vasodilator, the mean PAP was
46mmHg
with PVR 693 (dyne*sec)/cm5.
.
An ECHo as done that showed a small secundum atrial septal
defect/stretched PFO with bidirectional shunting. Two right
sided pulmonary veins and one large common left pulmonary vein
are seen entering the left atrium. There was no evidence of
partial anomalous pulmonary venous return.
.
The patient was then transferred to the MICU team to begin
treatment with flolan for her pulmonary artery htn.
.
Pulmonary Hypertension:  Likely from lupus.  An HIV test was
negative.  Patient was monitored in the ICU with a swan ganz
catheter, showing elevated pulmonary artery pressures and
pulmonary vascular resistence.  Flolan was titrated up, with
improvement in pulmonary vascular flow and patient's dyspnea.
At a rate of 14, the patient began feeling flushed, with severe
headache and pain in her jaw.  Additionally, her foward
pulmonary flow did not improve after the increase from [**1-2**],
and her PCWP rose precipitously, and it was settled that 12
would be her dosage for discharge from the hospital.  She had
extensive teaching from the flolan educators about needs at
home.  The patient learned well and is ready for the home
infusions.  She was also set up with home [**Month/Year (2) 20358**] and pulse
oximeter.  A tunneled groshaun line was placed and is in working
order.
.
CHF: The patient was diuresed with lasix over the course of her
hospital stay, and will be discharged on lasix 20mg PO QD.
.
Thrombocytopenia:  It was noticed that the patient's platelets
dropped during her stay.  Heparin was discontinued and A HIT
antibody test was negative.   The hematology team was consulted,
and concluded that her thrombocytopenia is likely due to either
HIT (even with a negative screen), or flolan.  At the end of her
stay, the platelets stabilized at 108, and she will need a
followup CBC in 1 week to further evaluate.
.
UTI: during her hospital stay, Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed a urinary
tract infection that grew cipro sensitive klebsiella.  She was
treated for 3 days with cipro, and a repeat urine culture was
negative.
.
DM2: She was treated with an insulin sliding scale during her
stay, and upon discharge, will restart her metformin at ome
dose.
.
SLE: She was continued on her home prednisone regimen.
.
fibromyalgia: She was continued on her home regimen of
amitryptiline, gabapentin, and pain meds prn
.
