HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
woman with recent admission for abnormal pulmonary nodule
evaluation from [**6-1**] to [**2168-6-5**], went home on 3
liters nasal cannula and supplemental oxygen, but started to
feel more fatigued with very limited activities.  The
patient, three weeks prior to admission, had developed
shortness of breath, cough and pharyngitis on seeing primary
care physician and chest x-ray with bilateral nodular
opacities, was started Z-pak and prednisone for presumed
community acquired pneumonia with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare.  After minimal improvement, she had
a chest CT which showed innumerable ill defined nodular air
space opacification, the largest of which was 2.8 x 3.8 cm in
the right upper lobe inferiorly, small vascular
calcifications in the pancreatic body.  She was then
admitted, steroids discontinued.  BAL and other studies were
all negative.  Blood cultures x4 were negative.  Biopsy was
performed endobronchially with no evidence of malignancy or
cancer, was discharged on [**6-3**] on 3 liters nasal cannula
although previously was on no O2 and developed worsening
shortness of breath and fatigue.  Reportedly saw primary care
physician with decreased O2 saturation, came to Emergency
Room and started to get more fatigued with some decreased
mental status.  Heart rate was 97, blood pressure 129/88,
breathing at 28, O2 saturation 82% on 3 liters, 100% on
nonrebreather.  Had arterial blood gases which was 7.23, 71,
218, intubated for pending respiratory distress, had
decreased blood pressure following intubation requiring
dopamine 10 mcg per kg per minute for a blood pressure of
110/50.  She also developed a sense of wheezing requiring
albuterol metered dose inhalers, given ceftriaxone 1 gm,
Solu-Medrol 1 gm intravenous.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count 16.7, hematocrit 35.1, platelets
414.  PTT 27.9, INR 1.2, sodium 1.6, potassium 5.4, chloride
91, bicarbonate 27, BUN 76, creatinine 3.7, glucose 115.
Ionized calcium was 1.04.  Urinalysis showed specific gravity
of 1.020, large blood, negative nitrite, 11 to 20 red blood
cells, 11 to 20 white blood cells, 0 to 2 granular casts.
Chest x-ray showed diffuse pulmonary nodules.  ET tube was in
place.  Left subclavian was in place.  Electrocardiogram
showed sinus at 55, normal axis, normal intervals, low
voltage in limb and precordial leads.  T-wave flattening in
lead 3, no acute changes.  Echocardiogram from [**2168-6-2**]
showed left atrial dilatation, left ventricular ejection
fraction greater than 55%, no valvular or pump dysfunction.
Endobronchial biopsy from [**6-3**] showed no malignancy or
granuloma.  BAL x3 showed no AFB, no fungus, no bacterium.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  The patient was initially
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient's O2 saturations were 82% on 3
liters, 100% nonrebreather with arterial blood gases of 7.23,
71, 281 at which point she was intubated and she was given
Solu-Medrol for treatment of presumed chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.  She was also treated with
ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of pneumonia which was then
changed to Levaquin.  The patient had a VATS procedure which
suggested ............  Further results from VATS showed a
biopsy consistent with Wegener's.  The patient has a history
of ANCA positivity, status post VATS.  The patient developed
a pneumothorax which was treated with a chest tube that was
subsequently discontinued after resolution of the
pneumothorax.  The patient was extubated on [**6-13**].  Her
most recent arterial blood gases was 7.36, 48, 119.  The
patient did well from a cardiopulmonary point of view.  She
required BIPAP at night and supplemental O2 3 liters nasal
cannula.  The patient will require further pulmonary
rehabilitation.

2.  RENAL:  The patient's creatinine was noted to 3.7 on
admission, presumed secondary to prerenal ATN.  Steroids were
started on admission for treatment of Wegener's.  Volume
resuscitation was also performed.  Low dose dopamine was
started and the patient's urine output improved.  Ultrasound
was checked and was normal.  The patient's Solu-Medrol was
changed to prednisone and Cytoxan for treatment of Wegener's.
The patient developed trace hematuria from Cytoxan, but this
has resolved.  The patient's last creatinine was 1.9 and she
was making good urine.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient developed decreased blood
pressure status post intubation.  This corrected status post
volume resuscitation and dopamine which was successfully
weaned off.  The patient's low blood pressure has not been an
issue for the rest of this admission.  On transfer to the
floor, the patient felt fine.  She denied fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal
pain, urinary tract changes, presented to medical floor for
further management and evaluation.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO FLOOR:
1.  Protonix 40 po qd
2.  Prednisone 70 po qd

5.  Hydralazine 20 mg po q6h
6.  Regular insulin sliding scale

12. Colace 100 mg po bid
13. Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn

The patient will be discharged to pulmonary rehabilitation on
[**2168-6-17**].
