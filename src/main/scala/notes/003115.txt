73 yo [**Location 7972**], Portuguese-speaking male with PMH dilated
cardiomyopathy EF 20%, AFIB, s/p epicardial pacer [**2172-7-1**] for
bradycardia/NSVT, chronic renal failure, s/p suprapubic
catheter, known fixed inferior defect on [**6-21**] p-mibi who p/t
[**Hospital1 18**] ED via EMS for 2 days lethargy/MS changes,
"hallucinations" per son decreased energy and left sided
weakness. This am patient couldn't get out of bed or move his
left side so son called EMS. Patient was intubated in ambulance
for airway protection and respiratory distress (RR 32).

Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] twice-- last d/ced
[**7-15**] (admitted [**2096-7-12**]) and on [**7-10**] ([**2091-6-17**]). On previous admit,
had epicardial pacer placed b/ bradycardic (h/o NSVT) on BB. Did
not get pacemaker b/o suprapubic catheter. Also, had acute on
chronic RF during admit which improved with IVF (Cr was 4.1 on
admit up from baseline in 3s). ACEI d/ced and home on BB. Renal
was following. Then, was readmitted [**2096-7-12**] again for RF (Cr
4.7) thought [**1-20**] to hypoperfusion and hydralazine started. Was
also ruled out for MI.

In ED, Cr 5.3, K 6.3 (got kaxeylate), EKG in AFIB rate
controlled, and baseline CXR. ECHO in ED revealed HK. Got
levoflox 500 iv x 1 for bacteriuria. INR 7- got 10 mg vitamin K

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was stabilized in the unit, his mental status change and
Left sided weakness resolved.  His creatinine came back to
baseline while still in the unit.  Patient was extubated and
[**Month/Day/Year **] transferred to the medical floor on hospital day 5.

1. Cardiac.  BP was 130-150/80-90 and HR of 70-90 during his
most of his hospital stay.  Patient was on hydralazine, ISMN,
Metoprolol, Dig, Spironolactone and Furosemide for management of
his systolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation.  Patient was
not placed on ACEinh and was d/c'd from Spironolactone at the
end of his hospital stay given multiple recent presentations,
including this admission, with hyperkalemia and ARF.  At end of
the hospital stay, blood pressure decreased to the 110-130/70-80
(goal 110-120/60-70).  Also started on a statin.  At time of
discharge, pt was breathing comfortably, no JVD, no LE edema,
and lungs CTA.

2. Acute on chronic RF.  ARF is prerenal secondary to decrease
PO.  Patient was gently rehydrated and by d/c day, his Cr was
2.8 (baseline [**2-20**]).

3. Hyperkalemia- got kaxeylate x 1 and his K dropped.  While
asynmptomatic, his potassium rose to 5.3 on spironolactone.  It
was therefore discontinued.

4. Mental status change and left side weakness- Possible new
right water-shed infarct.  Back to baseline. Able to ambulate
with walker & PT assistance.

5. transaminitis up to 200-300s thought to be from hepatic
congestion from CHF.  Resolved with optimizing his hemodynamics.
