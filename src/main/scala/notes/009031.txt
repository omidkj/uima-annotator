Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was taken to the MICU where she was initially somnolent,
tolerated BiPap for a period of time.  She indicated that she
did not want to use the Bipap.  Due to her continued hypotension
she required multiple fluid boluses and her respiratory status
worsened.  Her daughter was at the bedside throughout most of
the stay.  Pt's mental status was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] for the
first 24 hours in the MICU.  When she was clear, she stated that
she did not want to use any sort of non invasive ventillation,
