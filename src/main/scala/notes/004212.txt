History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M hx critical AS, dCHF, CAD s/p CABG and BMS on [**2150-9-1**]. He
was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] from [**Date range (1) 23135**] for heart failure from severe
AS and worsening CAD, and underwent stenting of RCA with BMS on
[**9-1**] presents s/p mechanical fall landed on R ribcage/head. Pt
was getting out of bed at approximately noon today when he
tripped and landed on his right chest. Pt denies preceding SOB,
chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness. After
fall, went home, proceeded with his usual activities. On
ascending stairs, however, pt was noted to have increased SOB.
Also complained of some right-sided chest pain. Family noted
that his breathing was "more labored" than usual so they called
911. Dry weight is 102, currently he is up in 1-teens.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.2 70 150/70 16 4L Nasal Cannula.
Initially saturating well on 4L then dropped sats, CXR showed 4
continugous rib fxs, edema and effusions. Put on high-[**Last Name (un) **] 100%
ventimask in order to maintain O2 sats. Given 80mg IV lasix x1
with ~600cc UOP and weaning of O2 from 100% to 75%. Ortho was
consulted who recommended ICU admission for overnight
observation due to the risk of splinting, especially in the
setting of CHF exacerbation.

On arrival to the MICU, he has no complaints and denies chest
pain, palpitations or shortness of breath. He has no
musculoskeletal pain to speak of. He was immediately weaned to
nasal cannula and was saturating 100% on 6L at the time of
admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M hx critical AS, dCHF, CAD s/p CABG with recent BMS to RCA
who presents from home s/p mechanical fall with 4 right sided
contiguous rib fractures and florid pulmonary edema.
.
#CHF exacerbation: TTE [**8-30**] showed dCHF and critical AS, and he
currently has the additional contribution from splinting from
rib fractures: fall-> pain -> inc sympa tone -> less diastole ->
pulm edema. EKG unchanged from baseline, pt not c/o chest pain
so antecedent MI unlikely.  He received 80IV lasix in the ED
with good UOP and already started to wean O2.  In the CCU, he
continued to be diuresed with Lasix, and he was negative net 2L
on the first day of admission.  He was transitioned to torsemide
on [**10-9**].  His admission weight was 54.6 kg, and his weight on
[**10-11**] was 48.2 kg. He was transferred to the floors where
diuresis continued with PO torsemide.
.
#CAD: s/p CABG and then with RCA BMS placed [**2150-8-30**]. Currently
no c/o chest pain or discomfort.  Cardiac enzymes were WML.
Initially aspirin, Plavix, and beta blocker were continued.
However, after consulting with the patient's primary
cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], we stopped the Plavix given he was over
a month out from BMS and given that we were starting warfarin
for afib.
.
#Rib fractures: Orthopedic surgery team saw the patient and
advised monitoring.  His pain was controlled with Tylenol.  He
will follow up with his PCP on [**10-23**].
.
#Atrial fibrillation: Patient had been on warfarin until he was
admitted to the hospital in [**Month (only) 216**] for GI bleed.  He was guaiac
negative here, and after consulting with Dr.
