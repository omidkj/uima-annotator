Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87 year old woman
with an extensive past medical history including coronary
artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft,
diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, status post
hemodialysis, congestive heart failure, who presents from
[**Hospital1 13199**] rehabilitation with complaints of abdominal pain.

The patient was discharged one month ago following a [**Hospital1 1444**] admission status post a fall
with a right Colles fracture.  Course was complicated by
worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis, non ST
elevation myocardial infarction, change of mental status, and
new onset stridor of unclear etiology.  She was discharged to
rehabilitation on [**2195-5-16**], and at that time had mild
intermittent crampy abdominal pain mainly in the bilateral
lower quadrants.  The patient also had decreased p.o. intake.

These symptoms progressed gradually over the two weeks prior
to admission, and then over the 36 hours prior to admission
became much more acute.  The patient was initially treated
with Oxycodone with temporary relief of the pain.  The pain
prior to admission was ten out of ten which prompted her
transfer to the Emergency Department.

The patient denies any exacerbating or alleviating factors
and does not feel that food changes her abdominal pain.  She
denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and is passing flatus
and belching.  She is unable to move her bowels without
laxatives but with laxatives is having fairly loose stools.
She denies hematochezia and melena.  Also, she notes a twenty
pound weight loss over one month.  No night sweats.  She also
admits to a sore throat over the past two weeks which she
attributes to a nasogastric tube on her last admission.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was given a
Morphine, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin, and Lopressor, intravenous
fluids and was seen by surgery who felt that the patient did
not have any acute surgical issues.  She was then transferred
to the floor.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking approximately forty

is currently at [**Hospital1 13199**] Rehabilitation following her
Colles' fracture.  She has a family who is very involved in
her care.  Her daughter, [**Name (NI) 17122**] [**Name (NI) **], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 99886**], is
her healthcare proxy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 98.4,
heart rate 75, blood pressure 107/23, respiratory rate 16,
oxygen saturation 100% on two liters.  In general, she is
awake and in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic, sclera
anicteric.  The pupils are restricted surgical.  Extraocular
movements are intact bilaterally.  Mucous membranes are dry.
The oropharynx is clear.  Positive exophthalmus. The neck is
supple with no bruits.  Jugular venous distention is seven
centimeters at 45 degrees.  Cardiovascular is regular rate
and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, II to III/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the apex and upper sternal border.  Chest -
occasional bibasilar rhonchi; otherwise clear to auscultation
bilaterally with moderate aeration.  The abdomen is obese,
soft, slightly distended with diffuse bilateral lower
quadrant tenderness without rebound or guarding, tympanitic,
no hepatosplenomegaly or pulsatile mass.  Extremities are
warm, dry with 1+ pedal pulses bilaterally.  Rectal -
positive external hemorrhoids, brown stool, guaiac positive
per Emergency Department and surgery.  Neurologically, she is
alert and oriented times three.  Speech is normal.  Cranial
nerves II through XII are intact bilaterally.  No focal
deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.46, pCO2
41, pO2 81 with a lactate of 0.8.  White blood cell count
9.9, hematocrit 37.0, blood urea nitrogen 9, creatinine 1.1.
CK 28, MB 3.0, troponin less than 0.3.

Chest x-ray without acute infiltrates or congestive heart
failure.  Abdomen supine and upright with nonspecific bowel
gas pattern, prominent loops of large and small bowel. CT of
the abdomen with intravenous contrast, no evidence of
intestinal ischemia, no acute intra-abdominal process to
account for the patient's symptoms.

Electrocardiogram - question of atrial paced, 85 beats per
minute, with possible worsening of ST segment depressions in
V3 through V5.  The patient was in sinus on [**2195-5-9**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Abdominal pain - The patient continues to note abdominal
pain on admission in bilateral lower quadrants and was no
different in nature.  The pain transiently was in epigastric
area.  The patient had normal liver function tests.
Gastroenterology was consulted who recommended vigorous bowel
regimen as well as possible colonoscopy if her cardiac issues
were stable.  The patient was planning to have this performed
until she showed respiratory distress.  At this time, her
gastrointestinal workup was delayed.  At the time of this
dictation, the patient will be reseen by Gastroenterology for
consideration of colonoscopy to assess for ischemic colitis
or other etiology.  She is also having Clostridium difficile
toxins for possible Clostridium difficile.  Laxatives and
bowel preparation did not appear to improve the patient's
abdominal pain.

2.  Laryngeal edema - On the patient's episode, she had acute
episode of stridor which was thought possibly secondary to
nasogastric tube placement or less likely due to chronic
gastroesophageal reflux disease.  ENT was reconsulted on the
floor and then they found supraglottic swelling.  The patient
was restarted on steroids, H2 blocker, as well as proton pump
inhibitor.  H1 blocker was not used due to possible change in
mental status with these medications.  The patient's stridor
did become worse.  On hospital day number three, the patient
had a blood gas drawn to check for a repeat lactate to assess
for ischemic colitis.  At the time, the gas showed a pH of
7.27, pCO2 51 and pO2 66.  It was felt the patient was having
a metabolic acidosis from her renal failure as well as a
re
