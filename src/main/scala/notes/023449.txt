Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15850**]
Chief Complaint:
Esophageal perforation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Left thoracotomy with repair of esophageal perforation
    and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy ([**7-5**])
2. Right tube thoracostomy ([**7-5**])
3. Right pigtail placement ([**7-14**])


History of Present Illness:
64 year old male who reports awakening at 5 am this morning with
the acute onset of chest pain. He then proceeded to vomit 3-4
times. The pain was severe and bilateral across his lower chest.
He went to an OSH and was found to have pneumomediastinum on CT,
WBC of 15, and tachycardia concerning for esophageal tear. He
was
given pain medication, 2L IVF, nebulizers, and zosyn. The
patient
was actively intoxicated on arrival but denied having vomited or
retched prior to the onset of pain. Denies having vomited last
night. Admits to heavy alcohol use. Describes ongoing dyspnea,
cough, COPD flares, and need for chronic home oxygen, usually at
night only.

He was med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] and on arrival was still
tachycardic
and intermittently tachypneic. He was essentially pain free on
evaluation, reporting his chest pain as much improved. Denies
further nausea or vomiting since arriving at the OSH. Reports
mild abdominal pain and sensation of bloating. Reports back pain
with deep breaths. Says that he has been short of breath for
many
years and continues to be. Intermittently wheezing and coughing
heavily over last few days as well. The patient was complaining
throughout the evaluation of wanting to smoke or walk up and get
around. He was actively tremulous throughout the evaluation and
exhibited signs of delirium.

Diagnostics/Imaging:
[**2189-7-5**]: UGI
Initial scout image of the chest demonstrates pneumomediastinum,
extending
superiorly into the right cervical region.  Small bilateral
pleural effusions are noted.  Bibasilar opacities are also
present.  There is no pneumothorax.  Water-soluable contrast was
orally administered and images were obtained in the oblique
projections.  Contrast leakage is demonstrated at the level of
the GE junction, which corresponds to CT chest findings of the
same date

[**2189-7-6**]: ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2189-7-7**]: ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%) secondary to focal hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2189-7-6**], focal inferior posterior hypokinesis is now
seen, but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies
precludes definitive comparison.

[**2189-7-7**]:ECG:
Sinus rhythm at 95bpm. Compared to previous tracing multiple
abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.

[**2189-7-10**]:ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%). The inferior free wall appears hypokinetic. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild posterior
leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2189-7-7**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
increased.

[**2189-7-12**]: CT chest with contrast:
No axillary lymphadenopathy is identified.  Stable mediastinal
lymphadenopathy measuring up to 8 mm in the pretracheal region
is identified.  No hilar lymphadenopathy is seen.  The thyroid
gland is unremarkable.

A central venous catheter is identified extending into the left
subclavian
vein with its tip in the distal SVC.  In addition, there is a
right lead
extending into the right subclavian vein with its tip in the
right atrium.
Prior to entering the subclavian vein, it is coiled in the
anterior superior subcutaneous tissues of the right chest.  The
heart size is normal.  The thoracic aorta demonstrates minimal
calcified or noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque, but is normal
in size.  The pulmonary artery is normal.  There is no
pericardial effusion.

The central tracheobronchial tree is patent.  There are
bilateral
pneumothoraces, greater on the right.  There are patchy airspace
opacities in
both lungs that were not seen previously and suggest
