ADDENDUM:

The patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit and
this is an addendum from the course on the Internal Medicine
Floor from [**2148-3-27**] through [**2148-3-22**].

This 83 year old woman with paranoid schizophrenia and
permanent resident of the [**Hospital1 **] Nursing Health Center, was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2148-2-24**], with a fever, hypoxia and hypotension.  She was found
to have a right lower lobe consolidation and multi-lobar
ground glass opacities consistent with multi-focal pneumonia
and bronchitis.  The patient was required to be intubated and
placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics.  Blood cultures, sputum
cultures and BAL cultures were all unrevealing.  Multiple
attempts to extubate the patient were made without success.
The patient continued to deteriorate clinically and on
[**3-13**], the family determined that given the patient's
quality of life had been failing over the years and the
patient had previously voiced the desire never to be kept
alive artificially, the patient would be made comfort
measures only.

The patient was extubated on [**3-15**] and placed on a
morphine drip which, at the time of receiving from the
Intensive Care Unit, was at 15 mg per hour.  Antibiotics and
tube feeds were discontinued.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Paranoid schizophrenia.
2.  Hyperthyroidism.
3.  Blindness.
4.  Difficulty hearing.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Dementia.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM THE UNIT:
[**Unit Number **].  Morphine sulfate 15 mg.

ALLERGIES:   She has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She was from the [**Hospital **] Nursing home.  Her
daughter, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 21277**] involved, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39018**],
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 39019**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory in this particular
situation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was an elderly white female on
receiving.  Her mouth was agape.  Her eyes were open.  She
does not respond to voice, tactile stimulation.  Vital signs
92; 91/27; 14; afebrile, 89% on 100% non-rebreather.  Skin
warm and dry.  Pupils 2 mm; left cataract, nonreactive.
Oropharynx was dry.  Neck was supple.  Lungs with coarse
respiratory crackles anteriorly throughout.  Regular rate and
rhythm.  Soft, nontender abdomen.  Extremities with no edema.
Neurologic:  As above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's course while on the floor was
characterized while being comfort measures only, it was
expected that she might pass away rather quickly once being
transferred, but in fact she did not.  She maintained her
breathing even on 15 and up to 16 mg of morphine per hour.
Her CBC and electrolytes were evaluated on the 18th after she
had managed to live for 36 hours after being comfort measures
only and being transferred from the Unit.  Her white count
was 29.9 with a hematocrit of 31.3, platelets were 413 and an
SMA-7 of 138, 6.2 potassium, 92, 33, 96 BUN, 4.2 creatinine,
122 glucose.  So, it was determined to stay the course,
continue the comfort measures only and she basically remained
unchanged.  It was then determined that she probably could do
better or just as well with decrease in the morphine drip.
She was taken from 15 mg per hour to 5 mg per hour with no
change in the respiratory status.

She continued at the same level.  She was reassessed and we
attempted to lower her morphine down from 5 to 3 mg per hour
and the patient could not tolerate that with increased
tachypnea and increasing sounding of secretions.  It was
turned up to 5 and it was determined that she would not
benefit from a lower level of morphine.

Her labs were rechecked again and she was found to have a
white blood cell count actually down to 18.6, 32.9
hematocrit, 328 platelets and a marginally worsening renal
failure with an SMA-7 of 138, 6.6 potassium from 6.2, 93, 31,
52 BUN, 4.6 creatinine from 4.2 and 114.  Calcium 8.6, 11.6
phosphorus, 3.8 magnesium and albumin of 2.5.  It was
determined that given the patient was actually rather stable,
but in a comfort measure only state, that she could be
stablely and safely transferred back to [**Hospital **] Nursing home
and provided with comfort care measures at that place.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
She is being currently maintained on the following comfort
medications:
1.  Scopolamine for her secretions, 1.5 to 4.5 mg, which is
one to three patches transdermally, q. 72 hours to titrate to
a level of tracheal secretions.
2.  She also is on a morphine drip at 5 mg per hours and she
could get as needed 1 to 2 grams intravenous bolus every 15
minutes times two p.r.n.
3.  She also has p.r.n. Tylenol 650 mg p.r. q. four to six
hours p.r.n. for any fever or discomfort that she may have.
4.  Also, because the patient experienced one seizure while
she was on the floor but has not been current since, she gets
Ativan 0.5 to 1.0 mg intravenous q. one hour p.r.n. to deal
with seizures.

Otherwise, no other intervention is planned to be done at
this time.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia.

DISPOSITION:   She remained Comfort Measures Only.
