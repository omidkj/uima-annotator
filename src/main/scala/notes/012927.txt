Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19690**]
Chief Complaint:
Generalized weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
C4-C5 Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is 65yoM with h/o MMP including DM with
retinopathy/neuropathy, HTN, s/p renal transplant, CAD< PVD, and
complicated lumbar disease who is transferred from clinic with 3
weeks of worsening generalized weakness(Prox>distal).

He has had difficulty walking for ~10 years for multiple reasons
including neuropathy, fractures, and complicated spinal
surgeries.  He has needed a cane for this time.  However, for
the last 3 weeks, he has required a walker as well.  This came
on acutely, as he woke up one morning with arm pain bilaterally
and right leg pain.  He also felt too weak to get out of bed.
He
went to the ED due to concerns for MI. He was found to not have
this but was clearly not walking normally, so he was given a
walker in the ED by PT and sent home. Since then, he reports he
has generally been very weak and needing help with things such
as dressing and even picking up fairly light objects. He has
also been using a wheelchair at times.  During this, he has not
had visual or hearing changes. No bowel/bladder changes, no
dysarthria, no SOB, no dysphagia. The pain has resolved, but the
weakness remains. He has intermittent foot numbness at baseline.
He also has baseline paresthesias and numbness in his fingers.
There is a question of a 5 pound weight loss in the past 3
weeks.

-----
L-spine plain film:1. Metallic stent in common iliac artery. No
other radiopaque foreign body is identified.
2. Severe degenerative changes at L4-5 disc space.
3.There is a deformity of the right femoral head, and shallow
right superior acetabulum indicating right hip dysplasia.
-----
CXR:Hyperinflation, chronic and moderately severe is not as
pronounced on today's study, perhaps by virtue of lordotic
positioning. The heart size is normal but has increased since
prior examinations and there is vascular engorgement in the
upper lung suggesting cardiac decompensation. Mild peribronchial
infiltration in the right upper lung could be asymmetric edema
or coexistent small airway inflammation. There is no
consolidation to suggest a bacterial pneumonia and no pleural
effusion is present, but this could be a focal atypical (viral,
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] mycoplasma) pneumonia.
-----
MRI C-spine:
IMPRESSION: Status post laminectomies. Soft tissue thickening
posteriorly at C4-5 level along with a large central and left
paracentral disc herniation at C4-5 level result in severe
spinal stenosis at this level. Multilevel degenerative changes
are seen at other levels. Myelomalacia within the spinal cord
with mild spinal cord atrophy at C3-4 level.
-----
TTE:The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A mid-cavitary  gradient is identified.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Chest CT [**2175-6-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with ARDS or
multifocal pneumonia. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
2. NG tube tip now in the mid esophagus.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. No acute intra-abdominal pathology identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 65 y/o M s/p kidney transplant, CAD, PVD, DMI, cervical
hematoma, p/w nstemi and sepsis/resp failure [**3-9**] PNA after
diskectomy

1. Cervical spinal stenosis:
He was transferred from clinic with 3 weeks of worsening
generalized weakness(Prox>distal).  His picture was initially
unclear as this may represent a myopathy, a dysfuntion of
multiple nerve roots, or a cervical cord lesion.  As it was an
acute event, we wanted to rule out cord pathology first.  He
also had a normal CK.
  An MRI of the cervical spine showed a severe canal stenosis
with cord impingement at L4-L5.  He also had some cord damage
evidenced on the MRI.  This stenosis was felt to be the cause of
his current acute on chronic weakness.  He also had some urinary
frequency which was likely the result of a spastic bladder whic
