[**1-30**] CXR IMPRESSION: No definite acute process. No free air.

CT ABD/PELVIS W/CONTRAST IMPRESSION:
1. Acute uncomplicated pancreatitis.
2. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis. Multiple large
duodenal
diverticuli, one of which is periampullary, although without
biliary ductal dilatation.
3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Small fat-containing paraumbilical hernias.
5. Small pulmonary nodules as noted. Assuming no known primary
malignancy or risk factors for primary lung neoplasm, followup
chest CT suggested in 12 months.

LENI LUE/LLE: No evidence of DVT.

ERCP Impression: A single periampullary diverticulum with large
opening was found at the major papilla
Cannulation of the biliary duct was then successful and deep
with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification.
A 5cm by 5FR Geenen pancreatic stent was placed successfully to
assist with biliary cannulation
There was a filling defect that appeared like sludge at the
lower third of the common bile duct.
Due to the clinical picture and a high suspicion for
cholangitis, a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Biliary sludge was extracted successfully using a 12 mm balloon.

The bile duct was clear at the end of the procedure.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations: Repeat ERCP in 1 week for pancreatic stent
removal
No aspirin, plavix, NSAIDS, coumadin for 7 days post procedure
Follow for response and complications. If any abdominal pain,
fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP
fellow on call ([**Pager number 8437**]).


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian-speaking female who
presents with several hours of acute onset of abdominal pain,
fevers, nausea, & vomiting consistent with acute gallstone
pancreatitis and cholangitis.  Pt was likely initially septic,
and was initially managed in the ICU.  She underwent ERCP with
sphincterotomy, biliary sweep with sludge removal.  Patient
clinically improved after ERCP. Please see below for details,
issue by issue.
.
# Acute pancreatitis: Patient with clinical, radiographic, and
hematologic signs of pancreatitis. Lactate 3.3. [**Last Name (un) 5063**]
Criteria score of 3 on admission, estimating approximately 15%
mortality. Lipase 6260 with elevated Tbili and Alk Phose
suggestive of gallstone pancreatitis. Lipase trended down to
3165 by the following morning. An ERCP was performed. No stones
were removed, but sphincterotomy was performed and a biliary
stent was placed.  Diet was advanced, which she tolerated
without difficulty.
.
# GI Bleed: on ICU day #2, the patient was noted to have one
episode of maroon stooling. This was thought to possibly be due
to a complication of ERCP, however, the patient and her daughter
(HCP) were offered re-exploration by ERCP and deferred, wishing
to avoid any further invasive procedures or possible intubation.
H/H subsequently remained stable. Pt passed black stool, guiac
positive, but this is thought to be old blood from previous
bleed; there is no evidence of ongoing bleed.
Discussed with ERCP, and they will check H/H at time of return
for PD stent removal.
.
# Anemia, acute blood lo
