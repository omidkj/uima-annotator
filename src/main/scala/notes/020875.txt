Chief Complaint:
emergent tracheostomy placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
rigid bronchoscopy, tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
43-year-old woman whom has a 2 to 3-week history of dyspnea
ultimately resulting in severe dyspnea and stridor and
presented to the emergency room requiring intubation. She was
unable to be intubated and therefore underwent an emergent
surgical airway via a cricothyroidotomy with a #6
endotracheal tube. She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further management. She has
severe supraglottic edema. We took her to the operating room
today to remove the cricothyroidotomy airway and place a
formal tracheostomy tube.

Past Medical History:
Asthma, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Hypertension,
Anxiety, depression, gastric esophogeal reflux disease, sleep
apnea -no treated, childhood seizures

CHEST ONE VIEW PORTABLE
INDICATION: 43-year-old woman with emergent tracheostomy.
COMMENTS: Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed,
and compared with the previous study of [**2186-9-15**].
The tracheostomy tube is seen in place. A nasogastric tube
terminates in the gastric body. No pneumothorax is identified.
The lung volume is small. Patchy atelectasis is seen at the lung
bases. The lungs are clear otherwise. The heart is normal in
size.

Title: PMV AND BEDSIDE GREEN DYE SWALLOW
PASSY-MUIR VALVE EVALUATION / DISPENSE AND BEDSIDE GREEN DYE
SWALLOW EVALUATION

HISTORY:
43 year old woman w/COPD, ASthma and a 20 pack year smoking
history who is s/p emergent trach at OSH prior to being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-9-13**] for airway management.  PMH
notable for GERD, anxiety, sleep apnea, depression.

She is s/p open tracheotomy here at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-9-15**].
Biopsy results from [**2186-9-13**] read "hyperplastic squamous mucosa
showing chronic inflammation and focal parakeratosis.
Malignancy NOT seen in this biopsy."

ENT exam [**2186-9-16**] showed thick aryepiglottic folds with difficulty
visualizing the aryntenoids.  False vocal cord edema and yellow,
polypoid material overlying the true vocal cords.

Repeat bedside laryngosocpy by ENT yesterday revealed continued
supraglottic edema.

Given airway trauma from failed intubation, emergent
cricothyroidotomy, and revision tracheotomy, severe supraglottic
edema is expected.

TRACH TYPE:
Portex #7

SECRETIONS / ABILITY TO HANDLE CUFF DEFLATION:
No difficulty with cuff deflation.

PMV TOLERANCE / VOCAL QUALITY / O2 SATS:
Pt able to produce strangled vocal quality with finger
occlusion.  Prior to PMV placement, pt with 92% O2 sats.  After
PMV placement, pt's O2 sats fluctuated between 89 and 94%
on room air.  She wore the PMV for at least 30 minutes with no
overt distress.  PMV was placed and removed several times with
no evidence of breath stacking.  Pt taught how to place and
remove PMV herself.  Vocal quality was very strangled and
hoarse throughout.  Plan is for patient to be d/c'd to home
today or tomorrow, therefore encouraged pt to wear PMV today,
but to remove it immediately if breathing feels effortful and
warned against sleeping with valve in place.  Pt warned against
showering or swimming with trach, even with PMV on, instead pt
will bathe and her husband will assist her with washing her
hair.

GREEN DYE SWALLOW EVALUATION
WIth the PMV in place, pt administered water via tsp, cup sip,
and straw as well as applesauce, both with green food coloring.
Tracheal suctioning was administered intermittently throughout
the trials. There were no overt s/s aspiration and no return of
green dye via tracheal suctioning.  Then, pt ate some [**Location (un) **]
cracker, [**Country 1073**] [**Location (un) 6002**], and drank apple juice with no overt
s/s
aspiration.

SUMMARY:
Pt appears to tolerate placement of the PMV with
strangled/effortful vocal quality, without significant O2
desaturation and without evidence of breath stacking, despite
known significant supraglottic edema.  She appears to tolerate
p.o.'s without evidence of aspiration.  D/C to home is planned
for later today, therefore education re: self placement and
removal of the PMV was administered as well as basic precautions
against showering or swimming with a trach.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  ALWAYS DEFLATE CUFF PRIOR TO PLACING THE PASSY-MUIR VALVE!

2.  Monitor O2 Sats / respiration while valve is in place.

3.  Do not allow the patient to sleep with the valve in place.

4.  If the patient is taking PO's, please deflate the cuff
    and place the PMV for eating and drinking.

5.  PMV wear schedule is up to the discretion of the
    nurse and/or respiratory therapist.
These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and
medical team.
