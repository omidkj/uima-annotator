Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2161-9-1**]:
Exploratory laparotomy, extended right colectomy, end-ileostomy
and Hartmann procedure.


History of Present Illness:
58M w multiple medical comorbidities xferred from OSH w
abdominal pain and diarrhea x 4 days.  Patient is chronically
ill with a question of poor compliance s/p recent AMA discharge
from [**Hospital1 18**] [**8-17**] after 3 day admission for gait instability.
Patient now reports 4 days of nausea, poor po intake, non-bloody
diarrhea, subjective fever, chills and malaise.  Also describes
black stools but unable to quantify duration.  This was
accompanied by progressive diffuse abdominal pain that
eventually prompted visit to OSH ED.  At OSH patient was
hemodynamically stable though CT A/P showed contained ascending
colon perforation with severe associated inflammation.  Also
demonstrated WBC to 14 and blood glucose in 400s.  Patient
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.

On arrival patient reiterates complaints above and describes
severe diffuse abdominal pain worse w movement and made better
only w narcotic pain medication.  Also w mild L sided chest
pain. Denies headache, blurry vision, double vision, dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from an outside hospital on [**2161-9-1**]
for management of a contained perforation of the ascending
colon.  Surgery consultation was obtained in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and
patient was admitted to the acute care surgery service for
further management in the TSICU.  Given patient's extensive
medical comorbidities and anti-coagulation (on plavix) he was
initially admitted to the TSICU with a plan for observation and
serial abdominal exams.  He was made NPO, resuscitated with IVF
and started on broad spectrum IV antibiotics (zosyn).  Over the
course of [**9-1**] patient's abdominal exam continued to worsen and
decision was made to bring patient to the OR [**9-1**] PM for
exploratory laparotomy.  Findings intra-operatively included a
large perforating tumor of the ascending colon.  An extended
right hemicolectomy was performed with long Hartmann's stump and
end ileostomy.  Postoperatively, patient was returned to [**Location 10115**]
extubated having tolerated procedure well.  Systems based
hospital course per below.  Patient was transferred to CC6 [**9-3**].


Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received intermittent
Morphine IV as well as a TAP block.  Pain control was changed to
intermittent dilaudid IV with improved effect and adequate pain
control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications. On [**2161-9-4**] the patient
began to show signs of agitation and delirium. He was evaluated
by psychiatry who determined the delirium to be most likely due
to narcotic pain medication. He was started on standing and prn
antipsychotics (haldol) per psychiatry recommendations. Haldol
was discontinued on [**9-7**] given a QTc interval of 464, and his
delirium continued to improve. By the day of discharge he was
longer exhibiting symptoms of acute delirium. He remained alert,
calm and cooperative at the time of discharge.

CV: All cardiovascular medications were held at time of
admission given possibility of evolving sepsis.  Medications
were resumed on [**9-6**].  On [**9-7**] his QTc interval was noted to be
464 ms (from 448 preoperatively on [**9-1**]) and his standing haldol
was discontinued. On [**9-8**] a follow up ECG showed a QTc of 443
ms. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 19206**] were routinely checked and repleted as
needed. The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored and he remained on
telemetry monitoring.
