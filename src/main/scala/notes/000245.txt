Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit, [**Location (un) **] Team

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49 year old male
initially admitted to the Medicine Service on [**2-3**] with
shortness of breath and spontaneous pneumothorax after
several cycles of Bleomycin for testicular seminoma who was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2190-2-5**] for hypoxia.

Briefly, the patient was initially diagnosed with seminoma in
[**2189-7-20**], status post orchiectomy for testicular mass.
Patchular vascular invasion with preoperative Beta HCG 9 that
remained elevated postoperatively.  Computerized tomography
scan showed metastatic evidence to chest, neck and abdomen
with both the retroperitoneal and subclavicular
lymphadenopathy.  The patient was treated with Bleomycin 180
units, Etoposide and Cisplatin in [**2189-10-19**] to [**2189-12-20**].  This was complicated by pneumonia on [**11-22**] and no
normalization of LDH, acid fast bacillus and Beta GG was
admitted to [**Location (un) **] outside hospital on [**1-10**] to
[**1-15**] with shortness of breath.  Chest computerized
tomography scan showed no pulmonary embolism but did show
bronchiectasis and interstitial fibrosis.  Pulmonary function
tests showed decrease in his DLCO per the chart.  It was
thought that he had drug toxicity.  Amiodarone was stopped
and Prednisone 60 mg p.o. q. day was started.  The patient
was readmitted to the outside hospital on [**1-27**] through
[**1-29**] with spontaneous pneumothorax and managed
expectantly.  He was seen on [**2-1**], felt okay and could
walk [**11-22**] mile.  On [**2-2**], after increasing shortness of
breath after coughing he went to the outside hospital.  He
had shaking chills, nasal congestion, increased clear sputum
and central chest congestion with occasional wheezing.  He
had a son at home with similar symptoms.  No orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema.  The patient had a
74% room air saturation and increased subcutaneous emphysema.
So, a left chest tube was placed with hemi valve.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] on [**2-3**] where he had a respiratory rate of 27,
saturations 83% on 3 liters to 91%, on 6 liters with an
arterial blood gases of 754, 32 and 68, and was admitted to
the Medicine Service.  The patient was started initially on
intravenous Bactrim empirically for primary care physician
given he was on Prednisone 60 as an outpatient and Prednisone
was increased to 80 mg p.o. q. day.  Cultures including viral
cultures were sent that were negative to date.  Chest
computerized tomography scan showed pulmonary fibrosis and
moderate left pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum emphysema,
soft tissue enlarged pulmonary artery.  Cardiothoracic
Surgery was consulted and recommended an existing chest tube
placement of 20 cm of water suction.  Echocardiogram was
performed and broad-spectrum antibiotics with Bactrim,
Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone were started empirically.  The
patient was with deteriorating oxygen saturation, so the
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cardiomyopathy in [**2182**], viral, also per chart from
outside hospital in [**2189-10-19**] had an ejection fraction
of 55%.  No mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid
regurgitation.  PA pressure is 25 to 30.
2.  Testicular cancer in [**2189-7-20**], radical
orchiectomy, pure seminoma with vascular invasion.
3.  Atrial fibrillation treated on Amiodarone discontinued
[**2189-12-20**], secondary to question of pulmonary fibrosis.
4.  Depression.
5.  History of mild renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine
of 2.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hypoxia - The patient presented with
diffuse infiltrates concerning for pulmonary fibrosis and
Bleomycin lung toxicity.  The patient had been on Amiodarone
which has also contributed and the patient also had a
spontaneous pneumothorax on chest x-ray which was managed
with chest tube placement as per Cardiothoracic Surgery.  The
patient was maintained on antibiotic treatments for his
pneumonia, given his sick contacts, also atypical
presentation, given his previous immunosuppression and
therefore the patient was continued on Prednisone.  So, the
patient was titrated oxygen.  Subsequently, however, the
patient had worsening hypoxia and on [**2-6**], after
extensive discussion with the patient and his wife, the
patient was subsequently intubated given his worsening
respiratory status.  The patient continued to be intubated
with worsening hypoxemia throughout the hospital course and
on [**2-10**], an extensive discussion was made with the family
and given the patient's inability to wean off of his FIO2 and
with worsening hypoxia it was agreed upon that the patient
should have comfort care as an ultimate goal for his
hospitalization, and on [**2-10**], the patient was
subsequently placed on Comfort-Measures-Only.  The patient's
family was informed.

Subsequently the patient also had some hypotension which was
covered with pressors and on [**2190-2-10**], at 10:26 PM, the
patient had worsening hypoxia and after withdrawal of care,
the patient was found to be unresponsive to deep sternal rub,
no heartsounds were palpable.  The patient was warm.  The
pupils were fixed and dilated, and subsequently the patient
was declared dead on [**2190-2-10**] at 10:26 PM.  Autopsy was
declined per family.

2.  History of atrial fibrillation - The patient was
maintained on Amiodarone and Atenolol for rate control.

3.  Cardiomyopathy - The patient was maintained on Lasix.

4.  Seminoma - The patient was status post three cycles of
Bleomycin, Etoposide and Cisplatin.  There were no acute
issues to be followed up with Oncology.

5.  Renal - The pa
