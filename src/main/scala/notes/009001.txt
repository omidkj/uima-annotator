Chief Complaint:
tranfer from OSH for diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R PICC placement
LIJ placement

History of Present Illness:
From family and OSH notes (no DC summary provided)
80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple abdominal
surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea. She had
diverticulitis with colovesicular fistula in [**2169**] that required
partial colonic resection and an ileostomy. In [**2170-12-4**], she had
the ileostomy reversed and since then, she has had worsening of
her diarrhea. In fact, since [**Month (only) **], she has been admitted to OSH 5
times for long hospital stays with extensive work up that has
been negative so far. Most recently, she was admitted to OSH
[**3-27**] where workup again has been negative. She has been getting
IVF; lasix held. The family requested a transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] this
morning for a 2nd opinion at a [**Hospital 82182**] care center. Of note
this morning, she had flash pulm edema and was given 40mg IV
lasix with [**2162**]+cc urine output.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on supplemental oxygen. On arrival
to the floor, she required 6LNC and was saturating 88%. ABG
showed paO2 of 54. CXR was consistent with significant pulm
edema. 40 mg IV lasix was given with 200cc UOP. Her saturation
improved on hi flow venti mask saturating 95%. Of note, her
central line is not at the proper place in the Xray. Because of
her hypoxia from CHF and likely PNA (leukocytosis, low grade
fever, sputum, cough), she was transferred to the MICU for
further care.
.
At the OSH, she was started on sucrulfate for gastritis, reglan
for mild gastroparesis and nortyptilline. She was also kept on
immodium standing at 4mg [**Hospital1 **] and psyllium. Her surgeons felt
that she had a "short colon". She underwent colonscopy and EGD
w/o diagnosis.

.
[**4-13**] ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Aortic
valve sclerosis.
.
[**4-13**] CT ab/pelvis

IMPRESSION:
1. Diffusely well-defined ground-glass opacity in the lungs with
some of
interspersed normal lung likely represent infection or ARDS.
2. Areas of edema, one in the right upper quadrant inferior to
the liver tip
and the surgical anastomosis may represent focal fat necrosis.
3. Additional edema in the pelvis superior to the Foley catheter
may
represent fat necrosis or focal omental infarct.
4. Unusual course of small bowel in posterior to the descending
colon may be
secondary to prior surgery or due to a internal hernia through
congenital
defect in sigmoid mesocolon (intersigmoid hernia). This does not
appear to be
at risk for incarceration given the long length under which the
small bowel
loops run posterior to the descending colon.
5. Multiple calcified mediastinal and hilar nodes likely
represents sarcoid
or less likely old granulomatous disease.
.
[**4-23**] Wrist XR
IMPRESSION: Probable "post-traumatic cyst-like defect" in the
scaphoid waist,
suggesting underlying fracture. This should be correlated
clinically and, if
warranted for further management, might be further characterized
by targeted
MDCT (with reformations).
.
[**4-23**] CXR
The left internal jugular line tip is at the superior SVC.
Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged. There is slight interval additional
improvement in
the parenchymal opacities that might represent a process of
fluctuation of
superimposed pulmonary edema giving the more involvement of the
lung
parenchyma than on for example [**2172-4-18**] or [**2172-4-20**],
although note is
made that the improvement of the lung parenchyma may lag after
clinical
improvement. There is slightly more lucent area in the right
suprahilar area
that may represent either parenchyma or a pneumatocele that
might be further
observed on the subsequent studies.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple abdominal
surgeries transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who was
admitted to MICU for hypoxia, now s/p intubation and extubation.
 Patient??????s respiratory distress continued to decline since
extubation and she was made comfort measures only and was made
comfortable on morphine drip. Antibiotics and steroids were
discontinued.  She passed away one day later.
Additional problem-based [**Name2 (NI) **] course:
1. Respiratory distress
Etiology is unclear. Initial event was likely related to
pneumonia and ARDS. She had improved bu
