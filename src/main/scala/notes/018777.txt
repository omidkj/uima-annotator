Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
S/P carotid catheterization with left internal carotid stent

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Carotid catheterization with left internal carotid stent

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 80 yo male with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, renal
failure, vertigo, and COPD who underwent carotid evaluation
after having a few episodes of some transient right leg tingling
as well as some dizziness.([**2106-4-6**] Carotid ultrasound: 71-90%
stenosis of the Left ICA, <50% right ICA.) The patient presented
to the [**Hospital3 **] ER on [**2106-5-16**] with loss of conciousness. He was
watching TV one evening and felt dizzy/room spinning. He lowered
himself down to the floor and did not wake up again until the
next morning.  The patient ruled out for an MI. An echo was done
which revelaed mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal wall motion and EF of 65%. An EEG was
also done and was negative. He could not give a good history
regarding exactly what happened but says he has a history of
dizziness. On [**2106-5-31**] pt underwent carotid endarterectomy and
found to have high bifurcation it was felt that it would not be
possible to safely clamp the distal internal carotid arteries
for endarterectomy.  It was decided to abort the carotid
endarterectomy and refer the patient for carotid stenting. Today
had catheterization of carotids with stenting to [**Doctor First Name 3098**]. In the
cath lab he had alternating hypertension on nipride and
hypotention and started on
   He denies CP, SOB, palpitations, visual changes, headache,
dizziness. He says that he has some pain when he walks from a
[**Hospital Ward Name **] cyst in LLE. Denies PND, orthopnea.

[**2106-7-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason: APHASIA.?BLEED

Attending evaluation of the images identifies a small area of
decreased attenuation in the left frontal lobe cortex and white
matter, consistent with recent infarction. This was not reported
on the initial resident interpretation, but was indicated as
possible infarction by the neurologist who evaluated the
patient.
Additionally, there is increased density within the intracranial
vasculature. Conversation with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2106-7-29**] at 10:15
a.m. reveals that the patient had a procedure prior to the CT, a
left carotid stent was placed and contrast was administered.
Time of the procedure relative to the scan and onset of symptoms
is not clear.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was informed of the change in the report. The patient
subsequently had an MRI on [**2106-7-29**], at 8 a.m. and this
verifies a subacute left frontal lobe infarction. The MRA does
not show a vascular abnormality of the carotid, vertebral,
anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: Left frontal lobe infarction, with acute appearance.
Correlate with clinical signs. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Generalized osteopenic appearance to the calvarium and base of
the skull. This may be due to Paget Disease. Hyperparathyroidism
would also be a consideration. Correlate with clinical history
and labs.

[**2106-7-28**] Carotid catheterization
1. Access: 6F shuttle sheath in the right common femoral artery.

2. Thoracic Aorta: Type I arch without significan lesions.
3. Carotid/Vertebral arteries: The RCCA was normal. The [**Country **] had
midl
disease. The [**Doctor First Name 3098**] fills the ipsilateral ACA/MCA with
contralateral
filling of the ACA/MCA. The [**Doctor First Name 3098**] had a tubular 99% lesion with
slow
flow. The [**Doctor First Name 3098**] fills the ipsilateral MCA.
4. Successful PTCA/stenting of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] with a 6-8x40mm AccuLink
stent
postdilated with a 4.5mm balloon with excellent results (see
PTCA
comments).
5. Right femoral arteriotomy site was successfully closed with a
6F
angioseal closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. [**Doctor First Name 3098**] stenting.

[**2106-7-29**]
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. There is an area of cortical and subcortical white matter
signal abnormality in the anterior left frontal lobe, which
represents an infarction. Given the pattern of T2 and diffusion
signal in this location, this infarction may be several hours to
several days (up to 10-14 days) in age. Correlation with onset
of symptoms is recommended to better establish the duration of
the infarction. There are also findings to suggest a small
amount of hemorrhage within the left frontal lobe infarction.
Additional areas of chronic ischemia and infarction are noted in
the brain.

MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates patency of the major
branches of this circulation. Findings were discussed with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] at 10:15 a.m. and Dr. [**Name (NI) **] of neurology at 10:35
a.m. on [**2106-7-29**].


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo male with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, renal failure,
vertigo, and COPD with several TIAs found to have carotid
disease now s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3098**] stent complicated by anterior frontal lobe
infarction with a small amount of hemorrhage with resulting
expressive aphasia
.
1. Carotid stenting: Patient underwent catheterization of his
carotid arteries and received a Acculink stent to his left
internal carotid artery.  During the procedure his blood
pressure was labile and had to be controlled with nipride and
phenylephrine. Upon arrival to the floor the patient was alert,
awake and oriented to person, place, an date.  He was a bit slow
with saying "no ifs ands or buts" and with calculations.  His
blood pressure were stable in the 130s upon arriving to the
floor.  The evening  of the cath he began to have some word
finding difficulties. Neurology was consulted and a CT head
without contrast was ordered.  It was read as no acute bleed.
However, the neurologist read it as possible stroke in left
frontal lobe and request at MRI.  The patient was put on the
list but could not get the study until the next morning.  Early
on hospital day number 2 he woke up with aphasia. He had garbled
speech and seemed frustrated that he could not express himself.
