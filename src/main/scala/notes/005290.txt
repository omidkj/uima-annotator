History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old W with PMH of CAD s/p MI, CVA, atrial fib on
coumadin, AAA (4.5cm) admitted to OSH with RLQ and LLQ pain
radiating to her back, Tm 100, leukocytosis of 18, amylase 1167,
lipase 3123, found to have a 5mm stone in the ampulla with a
dilated CBD of 7mm on CT abd and pancreas with associated edema.
Pain became progressively more severe. Therefore patient
underwent CTA Torso which was negative for PE or ruptured aortic
aneurysm. Of note, patient was also found to have a
supratherapeutic INR to 3.5. Patient was persistently
hypotensive. She received 500 ml bolus x 2 and was started on
levophed peripherally. She was covered with ceftriaxone 2g and
flagyl and received 10mg SC vitamin k for coagulopathy. She was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Upon transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she continued to require peripheral
pressors. PIV had infiltrated. Access was attempted but patient
aspirated as she was lying flat requiring CODE BLUE and urgent
intubation for airway protection. A line was placed with
subsequent central line placement.

Microbiology:

.
Imaging:
[**2140-9-26**] ERCP:
IMPRESSION: Dilated common bile duct suggestive of papillary
stenosis or
sphincter dysfunction and subsequent plastic stent placement. A
stone was
extracted per ERCP report.
.
[**2140-10-4**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-2**], there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevated pulmonary
venous pressure and bilateral pleural effusions, which now
appears more prominent on the right.
.
[**2140-10-5**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for
afib on coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis, biliary sepsis, e
coli bacteremia, respiratory failure, and Atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response.

1. Sepsis/e coli bacteremia: Patient presented with biliary
sepsis and outside hospital cultures speciated as pan-sensitive
E.coli.  She was hypotensive on admission requiring IV fluid
rescusitation and levophed pressor, which was weaned off. She
was treated with zosyn which was converted to
ampicillin/sulbactam which was coverted to PO augmentin upon
extubation to complete 14 day course on [**10-10**].

2. Respiratory Failure: Patient aspirated in setting of central
venous line insertion and was subsequently intubated.  Her
extubation was difficult due to volume overload which was
attributed to the volume rescusitation she had received.  An
echocardiogram and cardiac enzymes ruled out acute myocardial
infarction/congestive heart failure as etiology of the volume
overload.  She was succesfully extubated and transferred to the
regular medical floor, where she was diuresed with IV lasix and
weaned down on her oxygen requirement.  Because of her
aspiration, she was evaluated by speech and swallow and was
cleared for thick liquids and soft solids.
She was discharged on PO lasix, to be weaned and discontinued as
able with her oxygen requirement.

3. Pancreatitis: Patient presented with gallstone pancreatitis
and underwent successful ERCP with normalization of her LFTs and
lipase.  She will need to return for repeat ERCP and stent
removal in 4 weeks after discharge.

4. Coagulopathy: Patient was anticoagulated with coumadin for
her atrial fibrillation on presentation. She received FFP and
vitamin K, and her coags normalized during her hospital course.


5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Patient
developed tachycardia in setting of diuresis with furosemide
after volume overload.  This was treated successfully with
diltiazem, transitioned to metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid.
Re-initiation of coumadin was started on discharge, and INR will
need to be monitered as outpatient.

6. Anemia: Patient was transfused 2u PRBC during her hospital
stay, which stabilized hematocrit.

7. CAD: ASA and lisinopril and metoprolol were restarted after
stabilized from sepsis.
