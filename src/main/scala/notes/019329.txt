Chief Complaint:
post-operative NCSE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left VNS Battery chnage


History of Present Illness:
HPI; 56 yo F with history of epilepsy, VNS placed [**2172**], s/p R
temporal lobectomy [**2157**], legally blind [**1-11**] optic nerve
degneration, HTN, depression, presented for elective replacement
of her vagal nerve generator today, being transferred
post-operatively to neurology ICU for seizure activity and
unresponsiveness.  Patient is unable to provide history and thus
it is taken from recent notes.  The patient has a longstanding
history of intractable partial epilepsy with increase in seizure
frequency over the past few months, associated with wearing down
of her VNS generator battery.  Her home felbatol was increased a
few weeks ago by 600 mg, but subsequently felt dizzy and
unsteady
and dose was lowered.  Most recent note indicates she should be
taking 1[**Telephone/Fax (5) 106367**].  She has continued at her routine doses of
topiramate and tegretol XR.

As per recent clinic note [**2185-3-3**], her typical seizures consist
of;
- complex partial seizures with brief head nods, lapse of
awareness, lasting seconds, ocurring approximately four times
per
week.
- episodes when legs give out, feels like she is going to fall
but usually doesn't, without loss of consciousness
- intermittent "tremors" or shaking of head, sometimes also
involving hands over past two weeks.
- secondary generalized seizures, 2 in past month, last one [**2-21**]
- simple partial seizures with numbness/tingling down left arm
and at times legs, none recently
- she also has been noted to have a history of nonepileptic
events in the past as well

Pre-operatively the patient was witnessed by the [**Name8 (MD) 13042**] RN to have
two likely seizures.  The first event consisted of fine tremor
of
bilateraly arms with garbled speech, lasting 3-5 minutes,
followed by a second similar event lasting 7 minutes.  She
received 1.5 mg ativan after the first event and 0.5 mg ativan
after the second event.  She was taken to the OR and given an
additional 4 mg midazolam.  She was noted to have taken her
morning doses, however, there was concern whether she took her
evening medications as her pill box was still full for the night
time dose.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Post-operatively around 2 PM when the patient was weaned off
propofol, she was noted by [**Name8 (MD) 13042**] RN to have generalized twitching
in all extremities and not following commands.  Her eyes were
noted to be closed and in midposition when physically opened.
She received 2 mg ativan which did decrease her movements.  Her
activity persisted and was at other times noted to have left
toe,
hand, and face rhythmic twitching and received another 2 mg of
ativan as well as 1000 mg keppra.

At time of encounter she is intubated, off sedation, following
basic commands, with no obvious seizure activity.  EEG leads are
currently being placed.

ROS unobtainable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 106368**] is a 56 yo F with history of epilepsy, s/p VNS
placement [**2172**], R temporal lobectomy [**2157**], s/p replacement of
vagal nerve generator earlier this afternoon.  Post-operatively
after weaning sedation she was found to have rhythmic left-sided
twitching and unresponsiveness, concerning for status
epilepticus.  She has been having an increase in her seizure
frequency over the past several months, attributed to
diminishing effectiveness of vagal nerve generator.
Additionally, there is concern that the patient may have missed
her evening medications which may have also precipitated the
seizures in the context of the procedure.  The patient was
admitted to the neurology ICU for further care.

Hospital course by problem;
.
Neurology; The patient was continued on her home medications at
their current doses (Tegretol XR 800 mg q12h, Felbatol
1[**Telephone/Fax (5) 106369**] (as per patient's pill box, as dose has recently
changed multiple times), Topamax 100/200), and her vagal nerve
stimulator was resumed.  Additionally, she was loaded on keppra
(1700 mg postoperatively) and given an additional 200 mg topamax
x1.  She was started on continuous EEG monitoring, remained
intubated and on propofol for sedation.  Her home tegretol XR
was transitioned to carbamazepime 400/600/600 (as XR formulation
could not be given via OG tube) and was continued on keppra 1000
mg [**Hospital1 **].  Overnight and the following day once propofol was
weaned, the patient was found to have semi-rhythmic twitching
and jerking in her left face, arm, and leg of varying location.
These did not appear to have electrographic correlate and were
not believed to be seizures.  Several hours after her propofol
was weaned on [**3-9**] PM her mental status improved as she was
following commands and had a nonfocal examination.  She was
transferred to the neurology [**Hospital1 **] on [**2185-3-10**] and montiored with
continuous EEG monitoring.  She was maintained on her home AEDS.
