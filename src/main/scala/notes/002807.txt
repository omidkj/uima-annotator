Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2135-4-1**]: s/p Open reduction internal fixation, right femur.


History of Present Illness:
81 year old female who fell on [**2135-4-1**] resulting in a right
distal femur periprosthetic fracture requiring surgical
management.  81 year old female with past medical history of
dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia (wheelchair bound), and
s/p remote right TKR who presented yesterday from nursing home
after fall and femur fracture.  Pt now POD # 1 s/p right TKR
with acute mental status change.  Patient was interactive,
verbal, and responsive, althought not A and O x 3, prior to
surgery.  Post-operatively has been easily arousable but
disoriented and non-verbal.  Intra-op course uncomplicated,
received 2 units PRBCs in OR.
.
Currently, patient opens eyes to name, but is not able to
provide history.  Per family, patient was interactive prior to
ORIF.  They did endorse a steady decline in mental status over
the past 1-2 months, with increasing perseveration and some
short term memory deficits.  Son also notes intermittent
episodes of confusion over many decades.
.
ROS: unable to obtain [**1-18**] altered mental status.

Past Medical History:
1.  Dementia.
2.  Depression with a history of suicide attempts (last
hospitalized on the Psychiatric Unit at [**Hospital1 18**] in 11/[**2132**]).
3.  Multiple falls with subdural hematoma [**2128**].
4.  Seizure disorder.
5.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on any anticoagulation
due to history of falls.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Prior STH.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  currently POD #1 s/p right distal femur ORIF
2.  Right cataract surgery [**2132**].
3.  s/p right TKR
9.  Tardive dyskinesia.
10.  Cerebellar degeneration with chronic ataxia.
11.  History of alcohol abuse.
12.  Hepatitis B.
13.  Iron deficiency anemia.

Social History:
The patient is widowed; has 2 children (son and daughter). Went
to [**University/College **]where she majored in English with a minor
in history and worked a number of different jobs after
graduating but primarily worked in editing for a publishing firm
and at one point as a medical researcher. She ultimately had to
quit work when she became psychiatrically ill in her 30s (also
reports this is when her seizures started), and it appears this
was all after she found her mother hanging after a suicide
attempt, and her son says she has "PTSD" from this event).  She
has not worked since the early [**2104**], and was divorced from her
husband around this time as well. She had been living
independently in her own apartment until about 4 years ago but
had been failing for about the last five years of that stretch
with multiple falls which went undiscovered for days at a time.
She has been wheelchair bound for falls and cerebellar ataxia
(possibly related to extended phenytoin use) for the last 6
years or so. Her first placement was at [**Hospital1 **], where she
stayed for a year and did not like, and she has been at [**Last Name (un) **]
for the last three years.

Substance Abuse History: Per son history of alcoholism, now has
occasional weekly drinks at [**Last Name (un) **] with other residents and
son. [**Name (NI) **] is unable to specify amount. Distant history of tobacco
use, none in past 40 years. Denied knowledge of illicits.
Possible distant history of valium abuse in 70s.


Family History:
[**Name (NI) **] mother with completed suicide, son unsure of etiology
half sister who has been depressed and frequently hospitalized

IMAGING/STUDIES:

CT head- No acute intracranial abnormality

Right knee- Displaced and angulated fracture of the distal femur

CT C spine- No evidence of acute injury to the cervical spine.
In case of  clinical concern for cord-ligamentous injury, an MRI
can be obtained.

[**2135-4-3**] Chest PA lateral- IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest
compared to [**4-2**]: Multifocal pulmonary consolidation and
generalized interstitial abnormality continued to improve in all
areas except the perihilar right mid lung. Heart size is normal
and the mediastinal vasculature is no longer engorged. Overall
the findings are most likely due to resolving atypical edema.
Continued surveillance of a possible pneumonia in the right mid
lung; however, is appropriate. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion
if any is minimal.

[**2135-4-4**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats. Consider
left atrial abnormality. Low limb lead QRS voltage. Modest ST-T
wave changes. Findings are non-specific and baseline artifact
makes assessment difficult. Since the previous tracing of
[**2135-4-2**] there is probably no significant change.

[**2135-4-4**] portable CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-3**]:
Detail is severely obscured by respiratory motion. The caring
physician declined [**Name Initial (PRE) **] repeat examination when offered at 11 a.m.
on [**4-4**]. Cardiac silhouette has enlarged, and it is difficult to
exclude interstitial edema but right perihilar consolidation has
not cleared and remains a concern for pneumonia. Similarly
pleural effusion is hard to exclude. There is no large
pneumothorax but a small volume of pleural air would be missed.

[**2135-4-4**] CTA chest: CTA OF CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There
is marked atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic arch and arch
vessels. Coronary artery calcifica
