Service:  Oncology Medicine

Discharge for the dates the patient was on the oncology medicine
service.  The patient was discharged to the CCU for further care.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old right
handed man from [**Last Name (LF) 48047**], [**First Name3 (LF) 16465**] with a history of glioblastoma
multiforme who was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in clinic on the day of
admission.  Current medical history began in [**2196-5-10**] when he
experienced generalized tonic clonic seizure.  He was found to
have a left frontal mass.  At that time, he also developed a DVT
and had an IVC filter placed.  The mass was eventually resected
on [**2196-6-20**] with pathology consistent for glioblastoma multiforme.
The patient came from [**Last Name (LF) 48047**], [**First Name3 (LF) 16465**] to [**Location (un) 86**] for phase I boron
neutron capture therapy at [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient was lasted treated on [**2196-7-26**] with this procedure.
In the week prior to admission, the patient was noted to be
increasingly somnolent.  He also developed a shuffling gait and
some unsteadiness on his feet and urinary incontinence.  He had
been started on Ditropan XL with improvement of his urinary
incontinence and urinary urgency.  The patient denied headaches,
nausea, vomiting or tonic clonic seizures.  He also denied any
falls.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Glioblastoma multiforme, status post resection, status
post boron neutron capture therapy on [**2196-7-26**].
2.  DVT, status post [**Location (un) 260**] IVC filter.
3.  Status post right frontal craniotomy for glioblastoma
multiforme on [**2196-6-20**] in [**Last Name (LF) 48047**], [**First Name3 (LF) 16465**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] denies alcohol or
tobacco use.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Dilantin 300 mg q a.m., 200 mg
q p.m., Protonix 40 mg q day, Decadron 8 mg b.i.d., Cozaar 50
mg q day, metoprolol 50 mg q day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg
q day, Ditropan XL 10 mg q day and Aquaphor p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
(1) Encephalopathy:  Multiple possible explanations for
encephalopathy were pursued.  First of all, for question of
dehydration the patient was given IV fluids.  The patient was
also given a bowel regimen to have a bowel movement, which the
patient did on the day after admission.  The patient underwent an
EEG which showed generalized slowing, but no seizure activity.
The patient also had a lumbar puncture performed to rule out any
infectious etiology or neoplastic meningitis.  The lumbar
puncture was unremarkable.  The patient underwent an MRI of his
head on [**2196-9-17**], which showed no bleed and no significant
swelling.  An infectious etiology was also considered.  However,
chest x-ray, blood culture, and urine culture remained negative.
The patient's encephalopathy and also gait disturbance seemed
most likely to be consistent with radiation somnolence syndrome
especially given his experimental status for this therapy.
Possible treatment for his encephalopathy and gait disturbance
the patient was started on Sinemet.  The patient was also started
on Ritalin on [**2196-9-17**].

(2) Glioblastoma multiforme:  The patient was being followed by
the oncology service.  His MRI on [**2196-9-6**] and also on [**2196-9-16**],
did not show any significant findings that would be consistent
with the glioblastoma multiforme as the cause for the patient's
current symptoms.

(3) Cardiovascular:  On [**2196-9-18**], the patient became acutely
diaphoretic and had decreased oxygen saturations.  An EKG was
obtained, which showed a new right bundle branch block and also
some ST segment elevations.  The patient was treated for this
acute coronary syndrome with a sublingual nitroglycerin, aspirin
and additional doses of IV Lopressor.  Although the patient had
originally not experienced any chest pain with this event,
shortly afterwards the patient developed substernal chest pain,
which radiated to his arm.  He received sublingual nitroglycerin
with relief of pain after one sublingual nitroglycerin.  The
patient was also started on a nitroglycerin drip and also on a
heparin GTT.  The patient was transferred to the CCU for further
management.

(4) IV access:  The patient lost his peripheral IV access
during the acute coronary event.  A right internal jugular
line was placed for better venous access.  The line was placed
without complication.

The remainder of his hospital course will be dictated at a
later date.  The patient was transferred to the CCU from the
oncology medicine service for further care.  Upon discharge
from the hospital the patient will need physical therapy and
inpatient rehabilitation services.
