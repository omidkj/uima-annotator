CTA (OSH) - type B dissection starting just past takeoff of L
subclavian artery and extending down to above iliac bifurcation.
There is some R renal artery as discrepancy in perfusion of
kidneys (R<L).

CTA ([**2-6**]): Redemonstration of known type B aortic dissection,
which extends from the proximal descending thoracic aorta to
just above the aortoiliac bifurcation. The compressed true lumen
supplies the celiac axis, the SMA, and the left renal artery.
The false lumen supplies the right renal artery. Evolution of
infarct involving the right kidney, with increasing edematous
appearance of the largely nonperfusing kidney. Residual thin
cortical perfusion is identified, along with some segmental
perfusion of the right lower pole.

CTA ([**2-13**]): Redemonstration of type B aortic dissection. No
evidence of dissection extension into the proximal ascending
thoracic aorta or the aortic arch branch vessels.  Stable
extension of the dissection into the infrarenal portion of the
abdominal aorta. Celiac axis, SMA, left renal artery and
inferior mesenteric artery arise from the true lumen.  Two right
renal arteries are present, with one artery arising from the
false and true lumen each. The right renal artery arising from
the true lumen is compressed as it passes through the false
lumen. Evolving right renal infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery service with a type
B aortic dissection.  She was initially admitted to the ICU for
monitoring and strict blood pressure control.  She was seen by
cardiology for recommendations regarding a anti-hypertensive
medication regimen that would keep her systolic BP less than
130.  She underwent serial exams and demonstrated no signs of
mesenteric or peripheral limb ischemia.  On hospital day 3 she
underwent a repeat CTA abdomen due to continued abdominal and
back pain, which showed unchanged aortic dissection.  Abdominal
pain and back pain improved over the course of her ICU stay and
her diet was advanced to regular diet, which she tolerated well.
 On hospital day 3 she was found to have a UTI and she was
started on a 3 days course of ciprofloxacin. On hospital day 5
she was transferred to the VICU.  She was evaluated by PT who
recommended eventual dispo home.  She had been intermittently
confused in the ICU and her confusion recurred while in the
VICU.  She underwent an extensive delerium workup, which was
negative and her delerium subsequently resolved.  She had one
recurrence of abdominal pain and underwent another CTA abdomen
which showed unchanged aortic dissection.

Her creatinine remained stable throughout her hospital stay
despite infarcted right kidney.  Her blood pressure was well
controlled on the regimen recommended by cardiology.  At time of
discharge she had no pain, was tolerating a regular diet, was
alert and oriented, was able to ambulate independently and was
voiding spontaneously.  She will be  discharged with close
follow-up with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 32366**], for blood pressure control.

What is aortic dissection?

Aortic dissection is a tear or partial tear in the lining of the
largest blood vessel in the body, the aorta. This tear allows
blood (and the pressure of the blood flow) to penetrate the
arterial wall. Over time, this continuous flow can cause the
aorta to rupture - a condition that most people do not survive.

There are two types of aortic dissections, although sometimes
both are required:

Type A: A dissection to the ascending aorta is classified as a
Type A dissection. These dissections can be treated medically
(usually only briefly) or with interventional catheterization or
open surgical techniques.
Type B: A dissection of the descending aorta is classified as a
Type B dissection. These dissections are most often treated
medically with routine monitoring and prescribed medications.
There is a surgical option, but it carries substantially
increased risk of paralysis.
What are the warning signs and symptoms of aortic dissection?
Aortic dissections are commonly found in people with high blood
pressure, arteriosclerotic vascular disease, in individuals with
a family history of aortic (or thoracic) dissection and more
rarely associated with congenital cardiovascular disorders
(Marfan??????s syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and congenital
valvular disorders).
