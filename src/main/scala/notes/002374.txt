Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Cantonese speaking male with history of
thoracic aortic aneurysm who presents s/p recent admission to
[**Hospital1 336**] for mechanical fall, now with respiratory failure.
According to the family and EMS notes, the patient has had
increasing respiratory difficulties and had CXR yesterday wihich
showed RLL infiltrate. Was stable until this a.m. when he
developed acute OB approximately 1 hour after eating. O2 sat was
75-81% on NRB, received nebs, 200cc bolus for BP 90/54. +
chronic cough but no fevers or chills. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
In the ED the patient was tachypneic to 120 and hypoxic with O2
85% on NRB and decision was made to intubate (BP 105/59) - given
succinylcholine, versed, vecuronium. Was hypertensive
transiently to 209/114 but decreased with sedation. CXR with RLL
infiltrate and widened mediastinum and patient given CTX,
vancomycin, flagyl x 1 (family did not want CTA to eval for abd
aortic aneurysm). Also given decadron 10mg IV x 1 for history of
COPD.
.
Of note, patient recently admitted to OSH (NEMIC?) on
[**11-18**] with mechanical fall c/b transverse fracture through
C7 spinous process and BL laminar fracture of T1 vert. body,
both felt to be old based on MRI and spine cleared. Also with
aortic aneurysm (5x5.3) that family did not want to pursue
further with CTA. Also had high O2 requirement, unclear
etiology, but family stated this was baseline.

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2152-11-5**]:
sinus tachycardia, LAD, nml intervals, 0.5mm ST depressions in
II, III, aVF, V5, V6, unable to assess precordial leads fully as
V4 missing
.
CXR [**2152-11-5**]:
1.  Markedly enlarged contour of the left superior mediastinum.
A chest CT is recommended to evaluate for possible aortic
aneurysm.
2.  Patchy opacity involving the right mid and lower lungs could
represent infection or aspiration.
3.  Appropriate lines and tubes.
.
CT HEAD OSH:
resolution of Rsubdural, cerebral atrophy, white matter ischemic
changes, lacunar infarcts, menigioma - calicified and stable in
right frontal lobe


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with h/o PNA, COPD, aortic
aneursym, who presents with respiratory failure.  Based on CXR,
leukocytosis, exam, acute onset respiratory failure was likely
due to aspiration pneumonia. Course is suggestive of frank
aspiration episode given his known h/o aspiration and the acute
onset following a meal.  He was initially admitted to the MICU
service intubated from an outside hospital following acute
respiratory failure.  He was started empirically on Vancomycin &
Zosyn on admission to our unit.  Sputum cultures later grew
coagulase-positive staph aureus, and Vancomycin was continued
until organism was reported as sensitive to oxacillin.  He was
then continued on Nafcillin in lieu of Vancomycin.  After a few
days without improvement, he becamse hypotensive with good
response to fluid boluses; however, his wife [**Name (NI) 382**] declined
escalation of care, specifically including central access,
bronchoscopy, or pressor support.  At this initial family
meeting, she also confirmed that him to be DNR/DNI.  Mr. [**Known lastname 70798**]
sons [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) **] thereafter expressed concern that continued
mechanical ventilation, which was making him visibly
uncomfortable, was not in keeping with his wishes, and he was
extubated.  He initially remained on face mask oxygen and
continued antibiotics s/p extubation, despite medical
interpretation of his grim prognosis.  Ultimately, however, his
goals of care were transitioned to comfort measures only, and he
was started on a morphine drip and palliative care measures.
Establishment of these goals required repeated meetings with the
sons and extended family members, and ultimately sons [**Name (NI) **]
and [**Name (NI) **] expressed a clear understanding of his condition,
enabling them to arrive at this difficult decision.
