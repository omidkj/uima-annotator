History of Present Illness:
73yo male w/ stage IIIB squamous cell lung cancer, s/p recent
chemo and radiation, coming from a [**Hospital1 1501**] with dyspnea since
yesterday. No reported fevers, but also developed lower
extremity edema. EMS found him with shortness of breath, with
oxygen saturations in low 80s, put on non-rebreather, then CPAP
for transfer. No history of CHF. Appears cachectic.

Of note, the patient was recently admitted from [**9-13**] to
[**2179-9-17**] to [**Hospital 3278**] medical center with dysphagia and diagnosed
with radiation esophagitis. He was started on a PPI and
carafate, as well as Percocet. He tolerated a diet and was
discharged with follow-up with his oncologist. Attending was Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Etten.

In the ED, initial vitals were 99.0 151 113/87 30 93% on CPAP.
Patient was found to have a right-sided pneumothorax, so a
right-sided chest tube was placed, which drained 300cc of
foul-smelling purulent fluid after a large gush of air. Repeat
CXR showed incomplete expansion of the right lung. Chest tube
has put out another 300cc. Initially on BiPAP, then weaned to
non-rebreather. Given vanc/Zosyn. Labs notable for anemia of
33.8, lactate 3.3, WBC 7.3 with 33% bands. 2 PIV placed.  To get
CT scan, and on return to the ED had worsening hypoxia and
respiratory distress and was intubated. Received total 3L IV
fluid. Prior to transfer were 99, 73, 142/88, 24, 98%
non-rebreather.

Intubated and sedated, cannot provide further history.

Past Medical History:
- Stage IIIB squamous cell cancer diagnosed [**6-/2179**] with large
right lower lobe [**Location (un) 21851**] extending into the subcarina.

STUDIES:
[**2179-9-21**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST-T wave
changes in the lateral precordial leads.

[**2179-9-21**] CXR:
1. Large right-sided pneumothorax with deviation of mediastinal
structures to the left concerning for tension.
2. Hazy density in the left mid and lower lung zones which may
represent infectious process.

[**2179-9-21**] CT chest:
1. Per clinical concern for empyema, there is minimal layering
fluid within the right hemithorax without organization or
enhancing walls to suggest underlying empyema. There are dense
consolidations, worse in the right lower lobe with central areas
of hypoattenuation and air which are most compatible with
necrotizing pneumonia. Multifocal pneumonia is suspected with
extensive patchy opacities also noted in the right upper, left
upper and left lower lobes. Only the consolidation of the right
lower lobe demonstrates areas of necrosis. Given the
distribution, aspiration is a consideration.
2. Persistent right pneumothorax with indwelling chest tube.
Chest tube course as described above. There is baseline
pneumonia. No significant mediastinal shift is seen to suggest
recurrence of tension physiology.
3. Marked visceral pleural thickening, particularly of the lower
right hemithorax. This is of indeterminate etiology or
chronicity. This could be related to underlying infection. Given
the lack of parietal pleural thickening or other abnormality,
malignancy is felt less likely but is not excluded.

[**2179-9-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Diffuse abnormality in the right
lung continues to clear, particularly following removal of the
right pleural tube suggesting that most of this abnormality was
due to combination of edema and hemorrhage rather than
pneumonia. On the other hand consolidation in the left lower
lung has increased progressively since [**9-22**] and may well
be pneumonia. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion remains.
There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is top normal, improved
since earlier in the day. Left PIC line  ends in the upper SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73M with stage IIIB squamous cell lung cancer, s/p
