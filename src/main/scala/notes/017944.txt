HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 18-year-old
gentleman involved in a motor vehicle accident where he was a
restrained driver of a car that hit a house concrete porch.
He was found on the scene on the front seat vomiting.
Initial [**Location (un) 2611**] coma score was 10.  He was transferred to the
outside hospital where CT scan of the head showed evidence of
diffuse occipital injury specifically punctate hemorrhages,
lesions in his brain.

The patient was intubated for airway protection, and was
noted to have aspirated a large amount of emesis based on
suctioning from the endotracheal tube.  Patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Asthma.
2. Depression.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol.
2. Steroid inhaler.
3. [**Doctor First Name **].
4. Celexa.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is noted to use alcohol and
marijuana.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initially, vital signs are 127/70,
heart rate 62.  Patient is intubated 100%, temperature of 96.
In general, the patient was intubated, sedated, and
paralyzed.  Has a right occipital cephalohematoma posterior 3
mm bilaterally and midface is stable and no step-off.
Tympanic membranes are clear bilaterally.  Septal hematoma.
Neck:  Trachea is midline.  Cardiovascular was regular, rate,
and rhythm.  Respiratory:  Bilateral breath sounds,
rhonchorous at the bases, no emphysema, and no crepitus.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Pelvic is stable to [**Doctor Last Name **].  Rectal was guaiac
negative.  Extremities:  No dislocation deformities, 2+
pulses throughout.

LABORATORIES:  Initial hematocrit is 39.1, white blood cells
11.6, lactate 1.5, amylase 48, EtOH 240 at outside hospital
and 158 in the Emergency Department.

Patient had a CT scan of the head.  This showed multiple
small interparenchymal hemorrhages consistent with [**Doctor First Name **].  CT
scan of the C spine had no fracture or dislocation.  CT scan
of the abdomen, pelvis, and chest from the outside hospital
is negative.  Chest x-ray here showed right upper lobe
collapse, but no hemothorax and no widening of the
mediastinum.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  During the hospital course, the patient was
extubated.  Patient was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care
Unit, extubated the following day, and transferred to the
floor without any issues.  Patient was transferred to the
floor the next day.  The vital signs remained stable.
Patient neurologically had no lesions or no deficits.  The
patient was alert and oriented times three throughout.
Patient was maintained in a hard collar until flex films were
obtained on [**6-13**] which are negative for any ligamentous
injury or malalignment, and it is thought that patient at
work would benefit from a neurobehavioral consult given the
brain injury as well as addiction consult given his alcohol
and marijuana use.

Neurosurgery was also originally consulted to assess the
diffuse axonal injury.  They felt there was no operative
management required, and recommend neurochecks which were
fine.  The patient had no focal neurological deficit, no
weaknesses, although there was some weakness of the left
extremity noted at the beginning, but that has since
resolved, and the patient has no focal finding.  The left
foot was originally thought to be weaker than the right, but
that has since resolved.

Neurosurgery recommended repeat head CT scan to see if there
is any interval changes.  There are no changes on repeat CT
scan.  The patient is discharged out on ibuprofen as well as
a soft collar for comfort.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to followup with
Neurosurgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in one month and patient can also follow
up with Trauma Surgery as needed.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.
