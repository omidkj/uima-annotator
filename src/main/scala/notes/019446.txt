Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p elective Fidelis lead extraction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker lead extraction and replacement
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old male with complex medical history
including CAD s/p remote MI, s/p CABG and PCI, ischemic CMP, s/p
dual chamber pacemaker implant for high grade AV block and later
upgrade to dual chamber ICD.  A recent interrogation in [**Month (only) 216**]
revealed noise with inhibition of ventricular pacing with his
fidelis RV lead.  Patient denied palpitations, lightheadedness,
near syncope, syncope or ICD discharge to the CNP who spoke with
him on the phone a couple days ago. He was electively admitted
for lead extraction.
.
Patient was found to have hyperglycemia to 400s this AM when
presenting to the OR with initial ABG showing 7.17/43/328/17.
He had a hyperchloremic, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and
had a normal lactate.  During the case, he received 1 unit of
pRBCs, 3L NS and calcium with a couple amps of bicarb to help
his acid/base. Patient became hypotensive during the case
requiring vasopressin and levophed for pressure support. He
received a BiV pacer with improvement in his EF by TEE.
.
In the CCU, he is intubated and sedated.
.
Per wife, he has had no complaints and has been feeling well.
He has had AM hyperglycemia after night time snacks.

ECHO [**10-29**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Initial LV systolic function was depressed with LVEF =
30-35%, this improved to LVEF 35-45% with dual ventriular
pacing. No PFO seen. No clot in LAA seen.

CXR [**10-29**]:
The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube
projects
3 cm above the carina. Normal placement of a right internal
jugular vein
catheter without evidence of complications. Left pectoral
pacemaker in situ.  No nasogastric tube. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
evidence of pulmonary edema. Minimal pleural effusion. Moderate
retrocardiac atelectasis.

ECHO [**10-30**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral/basal inferoseptal
akinesis, as well as hypokinesis of the apex (multivessel CAD) .
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, most c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Significant residual intraventricular LV
dyssynchrony by visual inspection.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old male with
complex medical history including CAD s/p remote MI, s/p CABG
and PCI, ischemic CMP, s/p dual chamber pacemaker implant/ICD
for high grade AV block who presented for elective BiV/ICD
complicated by acidosis and hypotension.
.
# Pacemaker/ICD Placement:  Patient presented for elective
BiV/ICD, while in the OR patient became hypotensive requiring
levophed and vasopressin in the setting of large volume blood
loss.  Patient stablized and was weaned from pressors.  He has
followup in device clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1944**].
.
# Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive during OR case
requiring use of levophed and vasopressin.  Patient reportedly
had large blood loss during procedure and received total of 4
units of pRBC.  Other etiologies including cardiogenic, septic
and adrenal insufficency were evaluated and ruled out as cause.
He was weaned from pressors quickly once sedation was weaned and
he received blood.
.
# RTA: On admission, patient appeared to have combined non-gap
metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis in setting of
ventilat
