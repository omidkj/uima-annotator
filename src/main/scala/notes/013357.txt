Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
39 y/o F with PMHx of HIV(last CD4 of 401 in [**3-25**]), HCV
coinfection, peripheral neuropathy, chronic pain w/narcotic and
benzo dependence who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after adm to
[**Hospital1 **] [**2141-6-27**] for fever and MS changes with suspicion of
narcosis. Pertinent results include CT head neg, urine CX
negative, urine tox + methadone/oxycodone, cbc/cmp wnl, wbc not
elevated. CXR with mild/mod chf. Pt was evaluated by psych
service who was consulted for addiction issues.
Pt was c/o cough, N/V & dysuria. Pt received Acyclovir,
Vancomycin, Diflucan, Reyataz, Epzicom. MS improved on [**2141-6-29**]
and pt requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] where she receives outpt HIV
care. Pt had an episode of chest pain, sob, ekg w/o acute
ischemic changes. CE enzymes negative x2, repeat CXR showed
mild/mod chf and pt received lasix 80mg IV.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]: T 98.8 HR 97 BP 128/77 RR 22 initially
sats in 80s on 6L but improved to sats of 95-100% 4L NC. CTA was
neg for PE, but revealed multifocal infiltrates. Pt received
Vanco, levo for CAP and methylprednisolone 125mg IV, bactrim IV
600mg Q6H for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 31304**]
.
Pt initially arrived at medical floor and desated to 80s on 4L
NC and required Bipap. Her ABG pH 7.35 pCO2 63 pO2 61, she was
transferred to the MICU for further care.  Pt was initially
treated with bipap & weaned to NC supplemental oxygen with bipap
overnight for OSA. Per ID consult, Bactrim/steroids were stopped
due to low suspician for PCP & sputum sent for PCP is [**Name9 (PRE) 5692**]
negative. Three induced sputums have been collected to r/o TB,
[**2-19**] gram stains negative. Pt was continued on CAP treatment with
Ceftriaxone & Azithromycin, levofloxacin was stopped due to TB
rule out.  Urine legionella negative. Pt has remained afebrile
and sats are maintained from 88-92% on 4L NC. She has been
continued on Acyclovir for genital herpes outbreak with some
improvement in lesions. ID fellow confirmed that current MS
status has been present for 3mths but is a change from prior
baseline.
.
Currently, pt is denying SOB but has ongoing cough, sating 92%
on 4L NC and completing sentences easily.  She is reporting some
chest pain associated with coughing and deep breathing.  Pt is
tolerating po but reports that she has not had a BM in days &
has some discomfort at foley insertion site. Otherwise, she is
concerned about her narcotic regimen and possibility of
withdrawl.

.
CXR: Limited study, with findings suggestive of pulmonary
vascular congestion and interstitial edema; the right-sided
predominance raises the possibility of underlying mitral
valvular disease, particularly regurgitation
.
CTA:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal airspace opacities and consolidations, most
prominent in the right upper lung. Findings are most consistent
with an infectious process, and PCP and other opportunistic
pathogens should be considered given the patient's
immunosuppressed status.
3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions, but no septal thickening
or other evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
MRI [**2141-7-4**]: IMPRESSION: Normal MR of the head with gadolinium,
somewhat limited by patient motion.
.
Lower extremity U/S from [**7-5**]: No evidence of right lower
extremity DVT.
.
[**2141-7-4**] Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to tracing #1 the
anterior
ST-T wave changes have resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Upper lobe infiltrates/PNA: Pt was transfered with fever,
mental status changes & hypoxia/hypercarbia. CTA showed upper
lobe infiltrates and pt was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics including Bactrim for possible PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was consulted
and pt was ruled out for TB. Sputum was negative for PCP and
Bactrim was discontinued. Pt briefly required BIPAP to  support
oxygenation while awake but was quickly weaned to NC oxygen and
maintained sats in low 90s. Pt was noted to desat when sleeping
thought likely due to apneic episodes and she was offered BiPAP
as tolerated when sleeping.  Pt was explained that she will need
an outpt sleep study in order to qualify for bipap machine at
home. Ultimately, pt was switched to Levofloxacin 750mg daily to
complete a 10 day course of treatment for community acquired
pneumonia.  PT was consulted and her ambulatory sats improved
and pt was encouraged to continue with home PT &
albuterol/atrovent nebs as needed for wheezing and SOB.

# Hypoxia: Pt presented with community acquired PNA and has a
signficant restrictive defect on PFTs. Pulm pressures were
unable to be assessed on a recent ECHO from [**12-24**]. However, pt
likely has some component of pulm HTN from
obesity/hypoventilation & untreated OSA. Pt was offered BIPAP at
night for significant desaturations that occured when she was
sleeping but was non-compliant. Pt was given education on the
importance of treating OSA to prevent progression of this
process.  Pt will need a follow up sleep study performed as an
outpatient.
.
# HIV/HCV: Pt has co-infection with HIV/HCV and has been
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**], ID was consulted on admission. Pt
has been managed on HAART with most recent CD4 count of 400.
Additional labs were drawn while pt was in the ICU and the Abs
CD4 was low at 90. However, CD4 percentage preserved at 25%
suggesting that this number is falsely depressed due to her
acute infections. According to ID, the true CD4 count likely
closer to 400. HIV viral load is <50 and pt was continued on
outpt HAART regimen while in house.  Pt had an MRI performed for
question of subacute mental status changes that was read as
normal.  Pt was also noted to have an outbreak of HSV2
