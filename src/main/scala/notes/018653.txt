Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
69M history of colon cancer, status post resection in [**Month (only) 404**],
complains of progressive dyspnea on exertion since Monday and
severe dyspnea at rest today, as well as a vague feeling of
abdominal fullness. He presented to [**Hospital3 5365**] where they
obtained a CT torso showing extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli
with suggestion of RV strain, and questionable gallbladder wall
thickening. He was started on a heparin bolus and drip and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because he receives his usual care here.
Patient denied fever, chills, cough, chest pain, significant
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena,
hematochezia. Regarding prior malignancy history a lesion was
found on colonoscopy on [**2167-11-23**]. He had an abdominal CT to
evaluate extent of the lesion and was
found to have incidental pulmonary embolus which was treated
with lovenox then bridged to coumadin until [**5-/2168**] when it was
discontinued per PCP.
.
ED course: presenting vitals: 98.5 110 119/75  94% 4L NC. He was
noted to be persistently tachycardic. FAST exam notable for RV
strain. He was continued on the heparin drip. Labs notable for
WBC 11.6, PTT 142, normal creatinine, BNP<5, trop 0.13, and
ALT/AST 53/46.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed some GB wall thickening
and possible hemangioma 1.7cm. Admitted to MICU green for
management of PE. Vitals prior to transfer: 108 115/70 99% 3L
NC. Access: 20g R-ac, 20g-L-ac.
.
On the floor he confirms the above story and hx of prior PE,
anticoagulation history and recent symptomatology. Pt denied abd
pain or fullness and reported that breathing was somewhat
improved. He also pt reports long car trip 2 weeks ago.
.

Pertinent Results:
TTE ([**2168-8-20**])
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is >=15 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
Apical function is preserved ([**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign). There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild posterior leaflet
systolic A late systolic jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation

CXR ([**2168-8-19**])
FINDINGS: There are no old films available for comparison. The
lung volumes
are slightly low. There is a patchy area of volume loss at the
left base
which partially obscures the left hemidiaphragm that could
represent small
area of infiltrate versus volume loss. Otherwise, the lungs are
clear. The
heart is upper limits normal in size. There is no effusion.

LENIs ([**2168-8-20**])
IMPRESSION:
1. In right lower extremity, occlusive thrombus extending from
right calf
veins to the common femoral vein at the level of the greater
saphenous vein,
though minimal surrounding flow is noted in the right popliteal
vein.
2. Chronic partially occlusive thrombus within the left
popliteal vein.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US ([**2168-8-19**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild gallbladder distention and gallbladder wall edema
without stones or
sludge. These findings are nonspecific and may be related to
third spacing or possible hepatitis. Acute acalculous
cholecystitis is considered unlikely, however, if clinical
suspicion for acalculous cholecystitis is high, a HIDA scan may
be obtained for further evaluation.
2. 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm echogenic lesion in the right lobe of the
liver, likely a hemangioma; however, due to patient's history of
colon cancer, a metastatic lesion cannot be fully excluded. As a
result, MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
3. Septated cyst visualized in the left lobe of the liver.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2168-8-22**]):    No MRSA isolated.

Brief Hospital Course:
69y M hx of prior PE (off anticoag since [**Month (only) **]), HTN, [**Hospital 88414**]
transferred from OSH on heparin gtt for management.
.
# PE: OSH report suggests extensive thrombus b/l pulmonary
arteries and each lobar branch with increased exertional dyspnea
over past few days. Evidence of intraventricular septum
flattening on CT chest report and on FAST u/s in ED with RV
dysfunction. Chest xray showed low lung volumes, no
consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. He was switched from a
heparin gtt to LMWH given normal renal fxn, body habitus and
malignancy history. LENIs documented new RLE DVT; TTE confirmed
RV dysfunction.  Pt was transfered from the MICU to the general
medicine floor on [**2168-8-20**].  On [**2168-8-21**] pt had HR to the 160s and
was found to be in atrial fibrillation; pt. returned to sinus
rhythym with HR in 120's after 5 mg IV metoprolol.  Pt placed on
standing metoprolol.  He remained in sinus rhythym through the
rest of his hospitalization.  On [**8-23**] pt was satting well on RA.
.
# HTN: We held his home atenolol in the context of a PE; given
the management of the atrial fibrillation episode outlined
above, we continued to hold atenolol and placed him instead on
metoprolol.
.
# NIDDM: We held home metformin and placed on a sliding scale.
Blood sugars were well controlled throughout hospital
