Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, Leukocytosis, Supratherapeutic INR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-12-21**] Surgical partial excision of left inguinal lymph node.


History of Present Illness:
HPI:
79 yo male with history of afib and HTN was brought by son to
the ER for increased lethergy. According to son patient has been
having slowed speech on the phone since Friday and was noted to
be increasingly more sleepy over the past week. Pt reprots
increased dypsnea w/ ambulation, but no CP/orthopnea/PND. He
admits to decreased appetite and poor PO intake. Denies any
recent head injury or HA. In the ER he has a shuffling/slowed
walk and on exam there's a questionable R pronator drift and R
bicep and tricep weakness (pt is R handed - no h/o CVA) however
following examination by the ER attending these findings were
not apparent. Remainder exam normal w/ exception LE edema
(stable per pt). Pt's afebrile without obvious source of
infection. EKG was unremarkable and non contrast head ct
revealed no acute changes. His INR was noted to be 10.9 and he
was given PO vitamin K in the ER. He was noted to have a
peripheral WBC= 35,000 without clear explanation and CT abdomen
was ordered. This revealed 5 cm node L groin, L inguinal node.
He was therefore admitted for further evaluation. Pt apparently
denied any significant weight loss, night sweat/fever or
pruritis.

[**2142-12-18**] CT abd/pelvis with po and IV contrast:

CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  There is a small pleural effusion and region
of
compressive atelectasis at the left posterior lung base as well
as streaky
atelectasis at the right lung base. The heart is moderately
enlarged.  A small
hiatal hernia is noted. The aorta is densely calcified, as well
as most of its
major vessels including dense calcifications of the SMA. There
is focal
aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta measuring up to 3.1
cm (2:46).

A 1.2 cm simple cyst is seen at the dome of the right lobe of
the liver.
Additional subcentimeter hypodensities are scattered throughout
the liver and
are too small to further characterize but likely cysts. Multiple
renal cysts
including a prominent 2.7 cm left parapelvic cyst is noted.  The
kidneys are
small, however enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically.  The
spleen,
gallbladder, adrenal glands, and atrophied pancreas are normal.
Intra-
abdominal small and large bowel loops contain oral contrast with
no evidence
of wall thickening, obstruction, or perforation.  No free fluid
or mesenteric
lymphadenopathy.  Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen,
the largest of
which measures 1.1 cm in short-axis just behind the aortic
bifurcation (2:53).

CT OF THE PELVIS:  Small 0.7 cm lymph nodes are seen just
lateral to the
bifurcation of the left common iliac artery.  There are large
left external
iliac nodes measuring 3 x 2.8 cm (2:77) and 2.1 x 1.5 cm (2:74).
 There is a
large lymph node conglomerate in the left inguinal region
measuring
approximately 6 x 6 x 5.5 cm with small adjacent lymph nodes and
surrounding
fat stranding.  There is no right inguinal or right external
iliac
lymphadenopathy.  The bladder, prostate, and rectum are normal.
Scattered
diverticula are seen within the sigmoid colon.

There are no bone findings of malignancy.  Severe degenerative
changes are
noted in the lumbar spine with anterior wedge deformity of L2.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intra-abdominal pathology, including no evidence of
colitis or
abscess.

2.  Pathologically enlarged 6 cm left inguinal lymph node
conglomerate and
regional lymphadenopathy.  Differential includes lymphoma, or
metastatases
from melanoma or other tumors.  The node is quite superficial,
amenable to
percutaneous biopsy.

3.  Focal aneurysm of the infrarenal aorta measuring up to 3.1
cm.

Path Report [**2142-12-21**]: inguinal lymph node + L. GROIN (not flow
cytometry).
DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma (see
note).
.
Note:  Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are
positive for cytokeratin 903, MNF-116, p63, focally positive for
pancytokeratin, and are negative for PSA, PSAP, CK7, CK20, LCA,
CD30, CD20, CD3, S100, Tla1, and ALK.  These findings support
the diagnosis, and are suggestive of a squamous cell origin.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Leukocytosis)  Given the patient's neutrophilic leukocytosis
of 36K on admission in the setting of a pathologically enlarged
6cm left inguinal LN (by CT abd/pelvis)and left iliac LAD and
lack of any evidence of infectious etiology, concern was for
lymphoma or other malignancy.  Patient has never had a
colonoscopy.  Rectal exam was unremarkable and PSA within normal
range.  Ct abd/pelvis with oral and IV contrast revealed left
inguinal LAD per above.  Heme/onc was consulted and review of
the peripheral smear revealed numerous neutrophils with toxic
granulations but no lymphocytosis or evidence of blasts.

After patient's supratherapeutic INR was reversed, patient
underwent surgical partial excision of 6cm left inguianl LN with
results sent for pathology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics,
aerobic and anaerobic cx, AFB smear, AFB culture.  Path showed
findings c/w squamous cell carcinoma (please see above for
detailed pathology report).  Prior to receiving the official
path reports suggestive on an epithelial tumor, the patient was
found to have a fungating tumor on the shaft of his penis.  A
urology consult was obtained, and they felt that biopsy of this
lesion was of limited value given the pt's known squmous cell
carcinoma seen in the LN biosy and given persistent dyspnea and
hypoxia and declining clinical status.  Oncology recommended
biopsy of this lesion if possible for definitive diagnosis.  The
patient received a CT-PA for his dyspnea during this admission
(see below) and was found to have multiple enlarged lymph nodes
and lymphadenopathy.  The oncology team also noted that chest
lympadeno
