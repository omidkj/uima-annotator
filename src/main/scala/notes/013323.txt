[**2109-4-18**] for a complex mass near his gallbladder causing biliary
stricture.  He was found only to have chronic cholecystitis with
biliry stricture, and an open cholecystectomy was performed (see
Op Note).  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was transferred
to the floor after uneventful recovery in the PACU.  For the
first few days postoperatively, he did well. His diet was
advanced, and he began ambulating.  On POD 3, however, he
presented with acute respiratory distress, epigastric pain, and
a significant drop in his hematocrit. He was transferred
emergently to the ICU, and he was intubated and placed on
mechanical ventilation.  An endoscopy urgently performed
revealed esophagitis/gastritis, and a CXR revealed effusion with
pneumonia.  He was transfused several units of packed red blood
cells, started on GI protective medications, and administered
broad spectrum antibiotics.  He was started on tubefeeds per his
NG tube.  He would remain stable in the ICU.  By POD 6, he was
extubated, which he tolerated well. He began working with
physical therapy.  Tubefeeds were stopped as his oral diet was
advanced.  His pain was well-controlled with oral pain
medications.  On [**5-2**] he was discharged to home in stable
condition.
