Site: NARIS (NARE)
Source: Nasal swab.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2158-3-22**]):    No MRSA isolated.

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of pneumonia.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to multiple
prior chest radiographs dating back to [**2158-3-13**], with the most
recent radiograph from [**2158-3-17**].

Interval improvement of right upper lobe opacity has been
demonstrated in the interim compared to [**3-15**] radiographs. There are no new areas of opacities worrisome
for pneumonia. There is also improvement of left basilar opacity
with still present small area of pleural effusion. The
relatively rapidly improving consolidation might suggest
resolution of
pneumonia as well as resolution of aspiration.

The left subclavian line tip is in mid SVC. The left PICC line
tip is most
likely in superior SVC as well.

CTA:

INDICATION: 69-year-old with bilateral PCA infarcts after AAA
repair.

COMPARISONS: MRI/MRA brain of [**2158-3-14**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images through the brain with
post-contrast CT
angiogram sequences through the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and
carotid/vertebral
arteries with multiple 3D reformatted and curved MIP reformatted
images per CTA protocol.

CTA CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: There are evolving bilateral PCA territory
infarcts, as appreciated on the prior study. Source images
demonstrate no aneurysm, flow- limiting stenosis, or vascular
malformation through the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]. No acute hemorrhage
is appreciated. The ventricles and sulci are within normal
limits. 3D reformatted and MIP images confirm the above
findings. The intracranial portions of the vertebral arteries,
basilar arteries, and remainder of the posterior circulation
demonstrate no evidence of dissection, flow-limiting stenosis,
or aneurysm. There is mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary
sinuses bilaterally.

CTA CAROTID/VERTEBRALS: There is minimal calcified plaque about
the carotid bulbs bilaterally but no evidence of significant
stenosis, aneurysmal dilatation, or anatomic variation. The
internal carotid arteries appear widely patent throughout their
visualized course.

3D reformatted and curved MIP images confirm these findings.
Right common
carotid artery in the area of eccentric calcified plaque
measures 9 x 6.2 mm and the right distal internal carotid artery
measures 5.1 x 4.7 mm. The left proximal internal carotid artery
at the level of the bifurcation measures 8.6 x 12.4 mm with a
small amount of eccentric calcified plaque and the left distal
internal carotid artery measures 5.5 x 5.0 mm.

Throughout the vertebral arteries, there is no evidence of
dissection,
aneurysm, or flow-limiting stenosis. The vertebral arteries
originate
normally and are widely patent at their origin. 3D reformatted
and MIP images confirm these findings.

There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
seen at the upper portions of the imaged lungs with
consolidation at the right lung apex, which may be secondary to
aspiration, or an infectious etiology.

IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of stenosis or dissection throughout the
vertebral and basilar
arteries.

2) Minimal atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid bulbs, however,
no
significant stenosis.

3) Bilateral pleural effusions and right apical consolidation,
with likely
reactive mediastinal lymph nodes

MRA:

INDICATION: 69-year-old male status post AAA repair with left
hemianopsia
postoperatively. Evaluate for CVA.

FINDINGS:
MRI: There are several areas demonstrating slow diffusion,
including a large area in the right posterior subcortical
occipital lobe and several smaller cortical areas in the left
posterior occipital lobe. In addition, there are several tiny
diffusion abnormalities in the bilateral posterior frontal
lobes. These findings are consistent with a thromboembolic
etiology involving the parieto- occipital and calcarine branches
of the posterior cerebral arteries. No areas of acute
hemorrhage, mass or mass effect are identified. The ventricles
and sulci are normal in size and configuration.

MRA: The intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries
and their major branches appear normal without evidence of
flow-limiting stenosis, significant mural irregularity, or
aneurysm formation. The distal branches are not well
demonstrated, as they are at the limit of MRA resolution.

IMPRESSION:
1. Thromboembolic pattern of ischemia in the bilateral posterior
occipital
lobes and posterior bifrontal lobes suggestive of a PCA
distribution.

2. No carotid or vertebrobasilar abnormality detected; however,
CTA of the
neck may be performed for to evaluate for a potential
thromboembolic source.

ECHO:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is
present. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.5-2.0cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6102**],[**Known firstname **]  was admitted on [**2158-3-13**] with AAA. He agreed
to have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, he was consented.
A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained,  all
other preparations were made.

It was decided that she would undergo a:

PROCEDURE:  Retroperitoneal opened juxta renal aneurysm repair.

He was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any difficulty or complication.
