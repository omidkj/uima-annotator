Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Sympomatic GIB.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old female with a PMH significant for
chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, and CAD s/p CABG
sent to the ED for symptomatic anemia now admitted tot he MICU
for GIB.  The patient initially presented to her PCP yesterday
after feeling orthostatic, dizzy, and increasing short of breath
with climbing the 12 steps in her house over the past 3 days.
In addition, she states that she has had a dull chest pain going
across her chest and radiating for the past 1-2 months, which
has been worse in the past 3 days. She denies any change to her
bowel movements, including melena or hematochezia.  At that
time, a hct was checked which today returned as 17 from a
baseline of 25-30. She was then referred to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
Of note, the patient has a long history of anemia requiring
transfusions with multiple GI evaluations including upper and
lower endoscopy, and capsule study without a clear localizing GI
source. Since [**2107**], she has received a total of 7 units PRBCs at
[**Hospital1 18**]. She is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 349**] of Gastroenterology, and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] of Hematology has also evaluated the patient for
non-GI sources of anemia, with an unremarkable bone marrow
biospy in [**2101**] and SPEP in [**2109**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS afebrile 62 198/61 20 98%RA. The
patient was noted to have a hct of 17.6.  She has black tarry
guaiac positive stools, had a negative NGL, with an ECG that
demonstrated lateral STD. She was started on a ppi gtt,
transfused 2 units PRBC, and was admitted to the MICU for
further management.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comortably without complaints.

CXR [**2111-4-14**]:
Single AP view of the chest demonstrates stable moderate
cardiomegaly. The thoracic aorta is tortuous, with mural
calcifications.  Post-CABG changes and sternotomy wires are
redemonstrated. The lungs are low in volume, with bibasilar
atelectasis, particularly on the left. There are mild central
vascular congestion and a suggestion of Kerley B lines in the
left base, raising question of evolving early edema. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The left costophrenic angle is
partially excluded.  Multilevel lumbar spondylosis is present.

IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly, mild central vascular
congestion, and
possible evolving early edema. Bibasilar dependent atelectasis
more
pronounced on the left. No definite consolidation to suggest
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old woman with chronic atrial
fibrillation (off Coumadin), chronic anemia followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] (history of bone marrow biopsy), renovascular resistant
hypertension with renal artery stent (complicated with
occlusion), and coronary and peripheral artery disease who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2111-4-14**] with symptomatic anemia
related to her third episode of major gastrointestinal bleeding.
Her previous extensive GI work up was nondiagnostic (EGD,
colonoscopy and incomplete capsule endoscopy). She was taken off
Coumadin after her second major bleeding and now she has a
recurrent significant anemia while taking aspirin only. On MICU
presentation, she had mild elevation of troponin (0.04) with
mild nonspecific lateral ECG changes. The MICU team was
concerned about demand ischemia but she had no evidence of acute
myocardial infarction. In the MICU, 2 PI Vs were placed and her
hemodynamics were carefully monitored. Patient was seen by GI,
who recommended endoscopy. She was severely hypertensive without
evidence of hypertensive emergency. She received 5 units of RBC
transfusion for an initial Hgb of 5.5 and hematocrit of 17.6.
Her Endoscopy EGD) showed no source of bleeding despite guaiac
positive stools. The GI service recommended capsule endoscopy if
she develops recurrent bleeding. During her hospitalization, she
was noted to have worsening kidney function along with Labetalol
and Digoxin chronic toxicity with classic saggy ST depression,
atrial fibrillation with very slow ventricular response rate as
low as 30 (range 30-40), and mildly elevated digoxin level of
2.3 (does not correlate with toxicity). Her Labetalol and
Digoxin were discontinued and her severe hypertension was
treated with Imdur (new medication), Hydralazine, and Norvasc.
After her heart rate recovered, we restarted the Labetalol
because of CAD and uncontrolled hypertension. We did NOT restart
Digoxin because of risk of toxicity in elderly with CKD. Her
heart rate recovered to 50-70 even after restarting the
Labetalol. We also added Minoxidil (new medication) for better
control as her SBP was 170-200. She was not candidate for
ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] because of risk of hyperkalemia and worsening CKD
because of RAS and treatment with Aldactone. She was also noted
to be on 3 different diuretics (Aldosterone, HCTZ, and
Torsemide). These diuretics were held in the setting of acute
worsening of her kidney function. We restarted Aldactone and
Torsemide but not the HCTZ because of decreased GFR (decreased
efficacy) and risk of electrolyte abnormalities. Several
medication changes were made to address her uncontrolled
hypertension, worsening kidney function and bradycardia (see
below). We communicated the above with her Cardiologist, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **], and her hematologist. We also discussed
findings with her daughter who is her HCP and explained all her
medications in details. We asked her to f
