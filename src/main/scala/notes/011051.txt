In the ED, initial vitals were 86.3 58 120/82 18 100% RA. His
CXR showed no acute process compared to previous CXR. EKG showed
sinus bradycardia with [**Doctor Last Name **] wave. He subsequently became
hypotensive with SBP in 80s which responded to 90s with IVF. He
had RIJ place and placed on norepi with SBP in 130s.
.
His Labs were notable for potassium of 6.6 with creatinine of
1.9 (baseline creatinine of 1.2-1.4) for which he received
Insulin 10U, D50, kayexalate and calcium gluconate. His labs
were also notable for thrombocytopenia to 81 and WBC of 10.9. UA
was consistent with UTI. Blood and urine culture were sent. He
was given vancomycin/levaquin/flagyl for empiric coverage. He
was transferred to MICU for futher evaluation and management.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient reports having a little pain all
over body. He was not able to verbalize, but was shaking his
head yes/no. Found to have FSG in 30s.
