History of Present Illness:
(per admission note [**2125-2-20**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**]
72 yo male with PMH sig for CRI s/p kidney transplant in [**2121**],
CHF (35-40%), CAD s/p CABG, [**Hospital 11491**] transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] ICU
for concern of ARF and change in mental status. Pt recently
discharged from [**Location (un) 620**] on [**1-31**] and [**1-26**] for worsening dyspnea
thought to be secondary to CHF and COPD exacerbation. He sent to
rehab on 40mg IV lasix, 10 day course of levofloxacin, and
prednisone taper. He presented on [**2125-2-16**] with worsening SOB
thought to be secondary to COPD exacerbation and/or CHF
exacerbation. There was also quesiton of LL lobe pneumonia and
was started on Vancomycin/levofloxacin and IV steriods. He was
also diuresed with IV lasix. His respiratory status improved
with these interventions. CXR was consistent with CHF
exacerbation and BNP was >15,000. U/S of the abdomen was
performed that was unremarkable and LENI were negative for DVT.
CE negative x3. His renal function ranged btw 3.5-3.6. The
patient also received 1U pRBC for Hb 8. The patient had
increasing somnolence and given concern of tranplant failure he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On the floor the patient was unable to give a clear history. He
was oriented x3, but was slow and confused regarding his
symptoms and clinical course. He denied fevers, chills, chest
pain, SOB, or pain.

Cardiology Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2125-2-19**]  10:49:48 PM
Sinus rhythm. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with
repolarization
change. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2122-9-8**] no change.
.
[**2125-2-19**] CXR
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2122-9-7**], there is
increasing size of
the cardiac silhouette given the PA rather than AP view.
Increasing pulmonary vascular congestion. Silhouetting of one of
the hemidiaphragms is consistent with lower lung consolidation.
.
[**2125-2-19**] RENAL U/S
Transplant renal kidney in the right lower quadrant measures 9.9
cm, and has unremarkable [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale appearance. There is no
hydronephrosis or mass. There is no perinephric fluid
collection.
Color Doppler evaluation of the transplant renal vasculature
shows normal flow and waveforms, with resistive indices ranging
from 0.7 to 0.75 in the
segmental arterial branches. Diastolic flow in the main renal
artery is very slightly diminished, but main renal artery
waveform is otherwise normal, with brisk systolic upstroke. Main
renal vein has normal flow and waveforms.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable transplant renal ultrasound.
.
[**2125-2-20**] CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing pulmonary edema has markedly increased in severity.
There is now clear evidence of moderate-to-massive
intra-alveolar and interstitial fluid accumulation. The size of
the cardiac silhouette and the absence of pleural effusions is
unchanged. There is no evidence of focal parenchymal opacity
suggestive of pneumonia.
.
[**2125-2-21**] TTE
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
moderate hypokinesis of the septum and mild hypokinesis of the
basal to mid inferior segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Borderline dilatation of the left ventricle with
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-9-10**],
wall motion abnormalities are probably new (prior echo images
were suboptimal). Diastolic dysfunction can now be clearly
determined. The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased
slightly.
.
[**2125-2-21**] CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination,
the signs suggestive of pulmonary edema have moderately
decreased. They are, however, still present. Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly. No evidence of right pleural effusion, the left
sinus is not shown on today's image.
.
[**2125-2-23**] CXR
AP PORTABLE CHEST: The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.
The aorta
is mildly tortuous with calcifications noted of the arch. The
patient is
status post sternotomy. Pulmonary edema has significantly
improved and there is now mild residual interstitial edema.
There is mild subsegmental
atelectasis at the left lung base on this image which does not
fully include the costophrenic sulcus. There is no pneumothorax
or evidence of pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Significant improvement in pulmonary edema with now
mild residual interstitial edema. Mild subsegmental atelectasis
at the left lung base.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler images of the left and
right common
femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal
