IMAGING:
[**2171-1-7**] Venous Duplex bilateral lower extremities/vein mapping:
Patent right greater saphenous vein from the ankle to the
saphenofemoral junction. Patent left greater saphenous vein from
the low thigh to the saphenofemoral junction. Patent left lesser
saphenous vein.

[**2171-1-7**] Carotid ultrasound:
1. 60-69% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. 70-79% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.

[**2171-1-7**] CTA Head/Neck:
1. No acute intracranial findings with a stable head CT.
2. Approximately 70% stenosis of the proximal left internal
carotid artery, with approximately 60% stenosis of the proximal
right internal carotid artery. The extensive calcification
limits full evaluation of the luminal diameter.
3. Pulmonary findings as detailed which should be correlated
with clinical
findings and could be further evaluated with dedicated chest CT.


2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2171-1-23**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2169-11-20**], the RV size has probably increased.

[**2171-1-24**] Renal US:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. The left kidney is smaller on today's exam than on prior
imaging. Bilateral cortical thinning is again noted. No renal
stones are identified.
3. Parvus tardus waveform in the main renal artery of the left
kidney and
only limited intraparenchymal arterial flow identified could be
consistent
with what the patient states is known left renal artery
stenosis. No renal
artery stenosis is seen in the right kidney.

Brief Hospital Course:
VASCULAR SURGERY and CARDIOVASCULAR ICU COURSE [**Date range (3) 102762**]:
75 yo F with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG in [**2168**], PVD, diastolic CHF,
CKD, past TIA, and HTN, who was admitted to the vascular service
[**2171-1-6**] for a previously scheduled right common and external
illiac stent placement due to LLE rest pain. The surgery was
uneventful but it was determined that pt would require left
fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass as well. On afternoon after surgery [**2171-1-7**], code
stroke was called due to transient dysarthria and word finding
difficulties lasting approximately 45 minutes with severely
elevated BP. CT head negative for hemorrhage. This was felt to
be due to a Left ICA embolic event (similar to previous episode
where she was admitted for TIAs in [**2168**]). Patient was
transferred to the ICU for BP control, started on Heparin drip.
She was neurologically stable and symptoms gradually improved
with BP control. Patient had carotid dupplex in which there had
been some progression of stenosis, 60-69% stenosis of the right
internal carotid artery and 70-79% stenosis of the left internal
carotid artery since [**2170-6-13**]. It was noted at this time that
her creatinine was rising. Cardiology cleared pt for surgery and
left CEA was performed [**2171-1-10**]. She tolerated the procedure we
