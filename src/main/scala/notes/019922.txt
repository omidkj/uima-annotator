IMAGING:
ECHO [**3-2**] - The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function appears grossly preserved/vigorous
but views are technically suboptimal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular free wall motion appears
grossly preserved
in suboptimal views. The valves are not well visualized. No
significant mitral regurgitation is detected in suboptimal
views. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**3-2**] - A single semierect AP view at 1100 hrs is compared to
a supine film earlier from the same day. The positions of the
right IJ and endotracheal tubes are unchanged. The distal tip of
the NG tube cannot be appreciated due to underpenetration of the
film. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**3-6**] - Mild failure and left lower lobe pneumonia.
.
CXR [**3-7**] - PICC overlies the right atrium and should be pulled
back 2-3 cm into the distal SVC. Findings discussed by telephone
with IV therapy in the morning of [**2193-3-7**].
.
CXR [**3-8**] - The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are normal. There is a heterogeneous worsening opacity
in the left lower lobe indicative of pneumonia. The dense
opacity in the right lower lobe is likely due to overlying soft
tissue and unlikely due to pneumonia. Note that the left
costophrenic sulcus and lower lung is not included in the film.

.
CXR [**3-9**] - Improving aeration in both lung bases.
.
CXR [**3-13**] - Opacity in the right lower lobe, atelectasis vs.
consolidation. Small layering right pleural effusion.
.
ABD XR [**3-13**] - Normal gas pattern seen within the large bowel. No
evidence of megacolon.
.
ABD XR [**3-14**] - No abnormally dilated loops of small bowel are
seen. Normal gas pattern is seen within the large bowel. No
evidence of megacolon.
.
CT a/p [**3-14**] -
1. Atelectasis at the right lung base.
2. Small amount of ascites surrounding the liver.
3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
4. Mesenteric stranding and small pockets of mesenteric fluid in
the region of the distal small bowel with possible mild small
bowel wall thickening. In the clinical setting of the patient,
this is most likely due to an ischemic or infectious etiology.
Much less likely but included in the differential diagnosis
would be atypical Crohn's disease or lymphoma. The colon appears
unremarkable.
.
ECHO [**3-15**] - There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-3-2**],
probably no major change.
.
CXR [**3-17**] - Previous right pleural effusion has resolved. There is
no pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Aside from a band of
atelectasis in the right lower lobe, the lungs are clear. Heart
size is normal and the cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
are unremarkable. Biapical pleural thickening is symmetric and
unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 65851**] is a 59 yo M with  HTN and hyperlipidemia who
presents to [**Hospital1 18**] with group A strep toxic shock syndrome from
an injury to his R elbow from a rusted gas tank.
.
# TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME: Mr. [**Known lastname 65851**] was transferred from OSH
with a R elbow bursitis from grp A strep who was admitted s/p
debridement in OR with subsequent septic shock, respiratory
failure, and worsening renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU
and was intubated for respiratory distress. On arrival to the
MICU, the patient was without central venous access and required
vasopressors for hypotension. A TLC central line was placed
under U/S guidance. The patient was continued on penicillin G
and clindamycin (for 5 day course) was added
