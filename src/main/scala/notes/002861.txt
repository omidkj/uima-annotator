ny N/V x2. Pt has Hx of falls d/t gait instability. This fall
was preceeded by several days of low energy, cough and urinary
symptoms.  She denied fever chills and remainder of ROS
negative.

93% on 4LNC.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2122-1-21**] 5:34 PM
An endotracheal tube is in placed, with a tip located
approximately 5 cm from the carina. There is a left subclavian
Swan-Ganz catheter, with the tip overlying the right hilum and
is likely within the distal right main pulmonary artery. An NG
tube is in place, with the tip overlying the stomach. There is
relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15410**] opacification of the lung fields bilaterally,
with the majority of the cardiac contour silhouetted by the
opacities. The diffuse alveolar opacity, with some peribronchial
cuffing suggesting massive pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is
detected on the supine radiograph. There is a rectangular
density overlying the majority of the right chest and
mediastinum, which is assumed to be external to the patient,
which limits the exam.

IMPRESSION:

Multiple tubes and lines as described. This limited evaluation
suggests severe pulmonary edema.

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: LINGULA.

The histology of the organizing process is consistent with the
organizing stage of diffuse alveolar damage (ARDS).  Clinical
correlation is needed.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2122-1-22**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. A pacing wire is seen in the
RA.There is  mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size  is top normal/borderline dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular  systolic
dysfunction (LVEF 30-35%) with severe hypokinesis of the
inferior  wall and the entire septum to the apex. The lateral
wall moves best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Abnormal interventricular septal  motion consistent
with conduction defect/pacing. Right ventricular chamber  size
is normal. The RV free wall is hypokinetic. The ascending aorta
is mildly  dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are not well seen.
No significant aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Moderate, regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 620**] campus on [**2122-1-21**] for lung
biopsy to confirm resp failure from presumed ARDS or identify
alternative process respnsible for current clinical presenation.
Pt arrived intubated and was admitted to the SICU.
Initially sedated w/ propofol and paralyzed w/ cisatracurium to
maximize ventilatory status requiring assist control
ventialtion, 20 peep, esophageal ballon, 100% FIO2 to mainatin
sats mid 80's ( see lab section for ABG's).

Systems review:
Neuro: initiaaly paralyzed and sedated to max vent status.
Presently awake, alert, MAE but does not folow commands.
Remains on fentanyl @125mcg/hr and propofol @ 100mcg/kg/min

Resp: oxygenation and ventilation significantly improved w/
decreased peep requirement. Sats now high 90's on current vent
settings of Assist control, 50%, 600x30, peep 12.
Trached on [**2122-1-29**].

CV: off all pressors. RRR S1,S2.

GI: Initially tube feed by NGT. G-tube placed on [**2122-1-29**] c/b
free air extravasation. Taken to the OR emeregently for
exploration, repair and open G-Tube. G-Tube cuurently to gavity
drainage.

Endocrine: on insulin drip w/ good gycemic control.

Renal: function has returned to [**Location 4222**] after initial volume
resusitation. BUN 15/ CREAT 0.4

Heme/ID: was transfused w/ now stable HCT 30.5. WBC 14.9 and
presently on Imipenim, vanco, diflucan for septic pneumonia.


Medications on Admission:
Neurontin 600mg qam, 300mg qhs; lexoxyl 50mcg [**Last Name (un) 98509**] thru friday

ARDS seconary septic pneumonia.
[**2122-1-23**] left thoracotomy for lung biopsy- path positive for ARDS
pneumonia.
[**2122-1-29**] status post trach and peg c/b extrvasation of air
requiring open peg and repair of gastroscopy.

Discharge Condition:
stable

Discharge Instructions:
return to [**Hospital 98510**] [**Hospital 620**] campus for continued care.
