Date of Birth:   [**2077-12-5**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  69-year-old woman with a history of
diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
hypertension who presents as transfer from an outside
hospital for evaluation and management of ongoing chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  69-year-old woman with a history
of hypertension, diabetes who presents after acute onset of
substernal chest pain associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis
and increasing chest pain that persisted.  The patient went
to [**Hospital1 42365**] Hospital where she was found to have a
blood pressure of 210/110 and heart rate of 110, started on
IV Nitroglycerin and Heparin at that time and transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further work-up and
evaluation of her angina and for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, CVA, bilateral carotid stenosis, GERD, COPD, CAD.

MEDICATIONS:  Prior to admission included Ranitidine 150 mg
[**Hospital1 **], Albuterol inhaler, Prednisone 5 mg q d, Enalapril 2.5 mg
q d, Aspirin 325 mg q d, and Cardizem XL 180 mg q d.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine and IVP dye.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with husband and six children, quit
tobacco years ago, 120 pack years, no alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, heart rate 61, blood
pressure 146/44, respiratory rate 25, O2 saturation 95% on
three liters, temperature 96.6.  In general, pleasant woman
in bed, appearing comfortable.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light with extraocular movements
intact.  Neck supple, no JVD.  Cardiovascular, regular rate
and rhythm with no murmurs.  Lungs, diffuse expiratory
wheezes.  Abdomen obese, positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender.  Extremities, 1+ pitting edema, 1+ pedal pulses.
Skin without rashes.  Neuro, alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 134, potassium 5.5, chloride 100,
CO2 21, BUN 33, creatinine 1.2, glucose 457, anion gap 30, CK
584, troponin 48.9.  MB index 7.9, CK MB 46, white count
12.5, hematocrit 44.1, platelet count 243,000.  Outside
hospital report of head CT that is negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the cath lab
where she underwent catheterization.  Please see the cath
report for full details.  In summary, the patient underwent a
cardiac catheterization where she was found to have heavily
calcified and diffusely diseased LAD with a 90% proximal
stenosis, a diffusely diseased left circumflex and an RCA
with a 99% proximal and 80% distal lesion with left to right
collaterals.  At that time the patient underwent PTCA of both
RCA and LAD lesions.  The RCA lesion with good result and the
LAD lesion resulted in a small dissection after which she
developed severe recurrent chest pain.  An intra aortic
balloon pump was placed and the patient was brought to the
operating room for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting.
Please see the OR report for full details.

In summary, the patient had coronary artery bypass grafting
times two with a saphenous vein graft to the LAD and a
saphenous vein graft to the PDA.  The patient tolerated the
operation well and was transferred from the operating room to
the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  The patient did well
in the immediate postoperative period.  On postoperative day
#1 her intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued, she
remained hemodynamically stable after that time.  Then the
attempt was made to wean the patient to extubate at which
time the patient became increasingly agitated and tachypneic
with low total volume.  She was placed back on pressure
support ventilation and rested throughout the night.  On
postoperative day #2 her chest tubes were discontinued, she
remained on pressure support ventilation and on postoperative
day #3 she was again attempted to be weaned and extubated.
At that time she was successfully extubated, however, she
became increasingly agitated, hypertensive, tachypneic with
decreasing O2 sats within hours after extubation.  Within 12
hours the patient was reintubated.  At that time it was noted
that the patient had some sternal drainage.  Chest x-ray
showed that she had displaced sternal wires indicating
dehiscence of her sternum.  She was returned to the operating
room on [**4-22**] at which time she underwent re-wiring of her
sternum.  She was to remain sedated and intubated for 48
hours following her sternal wiring in order to give it the
chance to heal adequately.  During that time the patient was
noted to have an increased temperature with white blood cell
count up to 21.  Sputum cultures were positive at that time.
She was treated with the appropriate antibiotics.  However,
she continued to have worsening respiratory acidosis
requiring pressure control ventilation.  Over the next
several days the patient continued to have both a respiratory
and a metabolic acidosis at that time.  General surgery was
consulted as was the renal service in order to isolate a
source of the continuing acidosis.  Her antibiotic coverage
was also expanded at that time to include Ceftaz, Flagyl,
Vanco and Levofloxacin.  An abdominal CT was obtained which
showed no major abnormalities, however, she did have a
distended gallbladder and therefore underwent percutaneous
drainage of her gallbladder with tube left in place.
Patient's respiratory status gradually improved as did her
acidosis.  Her white count also returned to [**Location 213**] by [**4-30**].
We were able to turn her PEEP down to 5 and change her back
to an IMV mode of ventilation. Tube feeds were also started
at that time.  However, her renal failure continued to be an
issue and on [**5-3**] a Quinton catheter was placed and the
patient was begun on CVVHD.  Percutaneous trach was attempted
on [**5-4**], however, the attempt was unsuccessful and was
aborted due to a friable trachea and bleeding upon attempts
to place the tracheostomy.  The patient was also noted to
have a low platelet count.  Heparin antibody screen was sent
and the patient was found to be hit positive at that time.
Ultimately the patient remained ventilated for the next week
with her ventilatory status slowing improving and on [**5-14**] she
went to the operating room at which time she underwent an
open tracheostomy.  The patient was also converted to
conventional hemodialysis on [**5-14**].

Over the next several weeks the patient's status remained
essentially unchanged.  Issues that needed to be addressed
from that point forward included her neurological status.  On
[**5-16**] the patient's sedation was discontinued, she was very
slow to awaken and ultimately had a head CT done on [**5-20**] which
was reportedly negative.  Neuro consult was obtained at that
time.  Other issues that were also addressed over that
several week period include the placement of a Permacath for
continued hemodialysis as she would be dialysis dependent and
the placement of a PEG tube for continued feeding which was
done on [**5-25**].  The patient's chole tube remained clamped and
was ultimately removed on [**6-7**].  It was felt that the patient
is now stable and ready for transfer to rehabilitation.
Review of systems and physical examination at this time is as
follows.

1.  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.4, heart rate 66, sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 112/40, respiratory rate 21, O2
saturation 99% on 40% C-pap.

2.  Laboratory Data:  White count 6, hematocrit 30, platelet
count 23,000, sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 101, CO2
22, BUN 59, creatinine 2.5, glucose 110.  Neurologically the
patient has been off sedation since [**5-16**].  She had a negative
head CT on [**5-20**]. She has been followed by the neurology
service since that time and it is felt that she has a
metabolic encephalopathy which may clear with time.

3.  Respiratory:  The patient has a history of COPD
preoperatively.  he has 120 pack year smoking history. She
was steroid dependent although it was for arthritis control
prior to her surgery.  She currently has a tracheostomy which
was done on [**5-14**].  She requires pressure support ventilation
