Chief Complaint:
GI bleed, Anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy [**2104-7-20**]

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 71yo F with PMHx significant for prothrombin
disorder, multiple PEs on anti-coagulation, colonoscopy 10 days
ago with removal of benign polyp presenting from OSH with
significant GI bleed.

Patient reports 2 bloody BMs on the afternoon of presentation,
starting approximately at 1:30pm. The patient reports that the
BM was dark black and red and associated with abdominal pain.
Abdominal pain was relieved by the BM. She reports nausea, but

couple of days. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
She denies any melena or changes in BM leading up to her 2
bloody BMs.

Patient was noted to have two episodes of bleeding around noon
today  with EBL of [**1-6**].5 L (per EMS). Per OSH report, the
patient complained for dizziness and had hypotension. Initially
hpyotensive to 80/60 at OSH. INR at outside hospital 3.6, Hct
23. She was given 10 mg vitamin K, FFP, and 2L fluids.
Antibodies to RBC makes transfusion difficult, and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Of note, in regards to her anticoagulation history, the patient
was taken off coumadin from [**Date range (1) 29438**].

In the ED, the patient's initial vitals: 98.2 94 103/58 20 97%
on RA. The patient was noted to have guiaic positive stool. The

2 large-bore IVs were placed in the ED. The patient complaining
of abdominal pain with increased distention. KUB done in the ED
with stool in the colon and CXR showed no free air under the
diaphragm. Abdominal exam was significant for diffuse tenderness
to palpation with bowel sounds present. Active type and cross
was also done in the ED, and transfusion of 1 unit of pRBCs was
started. GI was made aware of the patient in the ED.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient reports abdominal pain and
distention.

Imaging:
KUB FINDINGS:
Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern is demonstrated.  Air is
scattered within nondilated loops of large bowel.  There are no
dilated loops of small bowel or pneumatosis.  No large amount of
free intraperitoneal air is seen though this evaluation is
limited on the supine exam.  Patient is status post L2-L4 lumbar
fusion and laminectomies.  Levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine is
noted with diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures.
IMPRESSION:
Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.  Assessment for free
intraperitoneal air is limited on this supine study though no
large amount of free intraperitoneal air is identified.

CXR:
The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural
effusions.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  No pneumothorax.
Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.

Brief Hospital Course:
71yo F with PMHx significant for prothrombin disorder, multiple
PEs on anti-coagulation, HTN, s/p colonoscopy 10 days ago with
removal of benign polyp who presented from OSH with post
endoscopic mucosal resection polypectomy bleed. She was
transferred to the MICU of hypotension. Colonoscopy on [**2104-7-20**]
showed ulceration and a clot, treated with injections of
epinephrine and two clips. She was intubated for this procedure
d/t history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] and anticipation of difficult
airway. Post-colonoscopy, she was started on heparin and
warfarin bridging therapy in anticipation of discharge on
warfarin. She received 5 units of pRBCs during the course of her
stay. She was transferred to the floor, where she continued to
be stable until discharge to nursing home. She was admitted on
[**2104-7-19**] and discharged on [**2104-7-27**].
.
# Post-polypectomy lower GI Bleed: s/p colonoscopy [**2104-7-11**] with
removal of large sessile polyp in the ascending colon. Per EMS
patient reportedly lost 1-1.5L blood. She was treated with
pantoprazole infusion and colonoscopy, with clips placed at
polypectomy site. Her hematocrits and hemodynamics continued to
be stable, and heparin drip was restarted after 24 hours of
stability. S
