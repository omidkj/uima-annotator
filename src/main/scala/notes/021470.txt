Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
"I can't breathe"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
84yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2095**], CHF last EF 30% in [**2112**]
presented with acute shortness of breath. He recently left [**Hospital1 18**]
on Sunday [**2115-2-1**] and fell in the lobby. He went to the ED and
was deemed low risk for injury and was discharged home. At home,
he continued to have shortness of breath that slowly worsened.
By [**2115-2-6**] his SOB worsened significantly and he began to feel
more fatigued. He was also not eating much and told his sister
"I can't breathe". At this point, he called EMS to take him to
the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.1  106  127/84  42  100%NRB. Tmax
was 100.6. The patient's tachypnea improved after initiating
bipap, however, after being given 1.5L of NS, the patient
quickly decompensated into tachypnea/respiratory failure and was
intubated. The patient also developed concerning precordial ST
depressions. He was given vancomycin 1gm IV, levofloxacin 750mg
IV, ASA 325mg PR. He was paralyzed with 120mg succscycholine IV,
and etomadate 20mg IV, and sedated with fentanyl gtt 100mcg/hr,
versed gtt 5mg/hr. His pressures subsequently dropped to 70s
systolic and he was started on levophed. As soon as this was
weaned off, his pressures would drop again and therefore, this
had to be restarted.
.
On the floor, the patient remained intubated and sedated and
otherwise stable. Per Respiratory Therapy, the patient was
making a moderate amount of yellowish secretions.
.

IMAGING
[**2-11**] TTE
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20 %) with thinning and akinesis of the inferior and
infero-lateral segments. The remaining segmetns are hypokinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-6-30**],
the LVEF has decreased and there is now moderate to severe MR.

[**2-11**] RUQ Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: 1. No biliary dilatation identified. Mild
gallbladder wall thickening and tiny amount of sludge, the
appearance of which is unchanged from the liver ultrasound of
[**2114-12-18**]. 2. No liver lesion identified. Tiny right
hepatic granuloma noted. 3. Left pleural effusion.

[**2-11**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.
2. Persistent retrocardiac opacity, consistent with
consolidation

Brief Hospital Course:
84yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2095**], CHF last EF 30% in [**2112**]
presenting with acute shortness of breath.
.
CHF exacerbation complicated by flash pulmonary edema (s/p IVF)
& hypoxic respiratory failure, likely [**2-6**] PNA, requiring
intubation & pressors in the MICU.

#) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: It appears that the patient
presented to the ED with a CHF exacerbation & hypotension and
was aggressively fluid resuscitated, leading to flash pulmonary
edema which contributed to respiratory failure requiring
inbutation. Patient was found to have HCAP, with increased
purulent secretions, new opacities on chest imaging, white count
and fever. He was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl and
his
