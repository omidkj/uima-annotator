Service:  General Surgery Purple Team
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 78-year-old
gentleman re-presenting to the Emergency Room with a distended
and tender abdomen. He was recently diagnosed with a descending
colon mass and an abscess. He was percutaneosly drained and was
awaiting an outpatient colonoscopy for diagnosis. He was
readmitted for constipation and a repeat CT scan was performed.
There was no evidence of a leak and the drain was therefore
removed. He presents today c/o left lower quadrant pain and
obstipation. He denies fever or chills. He has been anorectic
and nauseous. He vomited several times today. A KUB perfomed in
the ED revealed a large bowel obstruction. He is admitted for
fluid resuscitation and an emergent bowel resection with
temporary colostomy.
Past medical history is significant for chronic atrial
fibrillation requiring a pacer, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2129**], ? perforated colon cancer first noted in [**2135-7-25**], dementia, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2135-10-28**] for
an exploratory laparotomy, left hemicolectomy, Hartmann's pouch
and end colostomy.  Please see operative note per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for details of this operation.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by
hypovolemia requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit
for monitoring of his fluid status by central line.  The
patient was aggressively rehydrated in the unit, and was
ultimately discharged to the floor.

On the floor, the patient's stay was also complicated by
postoperative fever.  Blood cultures were obtained indicating
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was
then placed on Vancomycin.  Subsequent cultures have remained
negative.

The patient's course was also complicated by infection of his
abdominal wound requiring opening of the upper and lower
parts of his abdominal incision.  The patient was started on
a clear diet.  Upon transfer to the floor, he advanced in his
diet as tolerated.  The patient required one-to-one encouragement
of feeding to maintain adequate intake.

On the day of discharge to the rehabilitation facility, the
patient was taking in adequate oral intake.  His ostomy was
productive and he was voiding normally.  His abdominal wound
was without erythema or evidence of infection. Of note, the
pathology revealed a T3N1 colon cancer. He was seen by oncology
and will f/u with that service after discharge.
