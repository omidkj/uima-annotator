CXR ([**2139-2-18**]):  Heterogeneous opacification in the lower lungs,
particularly in the middle lobe, is new since [**Month (only) 359**]. Elevation
of the right lung base laterally could be due to a small
subpulmonic pleural effusion. There is no left pleural effusion,
heart size is normal and there is no indication of central
adenopathy. Overall, findings are consistent with pneumonia,
including nonbacterial causes such as viral infection or even
pneumocystis. Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] and I discussed these findings
by telephone at the time of dictation.
.
CT chest with contrast ([**2139-2-19**]):  1. Extensive multifocal
parenchymal consolidations, ground-glass and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities predominantly in a peribronchial distribution, most
severe within the right lower lobe. These findings are
consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Small right pleural
effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is likely reactive in
nature.  2. Mild left hydronephrosis, new compared to prior
study of [**2138-11-19**].  3. Post-surgical changes within the
upper abdomen status post splenectomy and liver [**Year (4 digits) **].
.
MRI L-spine with gad ([**2139-2-19**]):  1. No evidence of
osteomyelitis, discitis or other spinal infection.  2. Chronic
post-operative changes at L4-L5 with underlying degenerative
disease and congenital stenosis. This is most prominent at L4-L5
and L5-S1, where there is probable impingement upon the
left-sided traversing nerve roots in those subarticular zones.
3. Diffusely T1- and T2-hypointense vertebral bone marrow signal
may relate to the immunosuppressive medications for hepatic
[**Month/Day/Year **] patient's and/or chronic hematologic abnormality
(history of ITP, s/p splenectomy); correlate with clinical and
laboratory data.  4. Mild paraortic lymphadenopathy and urinary
bladder distention with diverticulum, unchanged from [**2138-11-19**]
CT.
.
CTA chest ([**2139-3-10**]):  1. Progression of multifocal opacities
suggesting pneumonia with consolidative opacities within the
right upper, lower, and left lower lobes.   Overall similar to
slightly worsened appearance of axillary and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, probably reactive in etiology, although not
specific.   2. New left pleural effusion and progressed right
pleural effusion.  3. Smooth septal thickening suggesting f
