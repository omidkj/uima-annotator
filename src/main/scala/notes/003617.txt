History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old male with polycystic kidney disease,
dialysis dependent who was in the process of kidney transplant
evaluation.  The patient had CT chest on [**2127-10-1**] revealing a 2.2
x 2.1 x 2.4 cm right upper lobe lung nodule, which was treated
with antibiotics.  He then had a repeat CT chest [**2127-11-6**]
revealing increased size to 2.9 x 2.5 x 2.6 cm.  Patient was
being worked up for a right upper lobe nodule removal and was
found to have a positive stress test.  Upon telephone interview
with patient he states he gets fatigue very easily, he denies
chest discomfort.  Patient complains of shortness of breath on
exertion for the past six months.

Pertinent Results:
[**2127-12-4**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated a
distal lesion in the LMCA extening in the proximal LAD of 60-70%

stenosis. The LAd had a 60-70% mid ulcerated lesion with a 90%
distal
lesion into the diag bifurcation.  The Lcx was normal. The RCA
had a 60%
mid and 70% distal lesion.
2.  Limited hemodynamics revealed severe centralized
hypertenison to
193mm Hg that was treated with a nitroglycerine drip during the
procere.
3.  In the post procedure holding are the patient developed a
mild-moderate size hematoma in the right groin that was easily
controlled and regressed with manual pressure

[**2127-12-5**] ECHO
Intraoeprative findings:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7772**] was notified in person of the results.

[**2127-12-5**] Carotid ultrasound
Mild heterogeneous plaque bilaterally with bilateral 1-39% ICA
stenosis. Vertebral abnormalities as described above without any
significant evidence of inflow disease on the left.

[**2127-12-5**] Femoral ultrasound
Normal study, without pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula, or hematoma.

Final Report
CLINICAL HISTORY: Status post CABG, evaluate for pleural
effusion.

COMPARISON: Multiple radiographs dating back to [**2127-12-5**], most
recently
[**2127-12-6**]; outside CT [**2127-11-6**] and PET [**2127-11-15**].

FINDINGS: Compared to [**2127-12-6**], lung volumes are improved.
There is mild
bibasilar atelectasis with improvement in retrocardiac
atelectasis. A tiny
left pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax or
pulmonary vascular
congestion. A calcified granuloma is at the right lung base. A
right medial
apical mass corresonds to mass seen on outside CT and PET. The
heart is stably
enlarged. The mediastinal width is decreased since [**2127-12-6**] in
this patient
status post CABG. A right internal jugular catheter terminates
in the mid
SVC.

IMPRESSION:
1. Tiny left pleural effusion.
2. Improved retrocardiac atelectasis with mild persistent
bibasilar
atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2127-12-4**] for a cardiac
catheterization following a positive stress test. He underwent
stress testing due to an enlarging right upper lobe lung nodule
which is being followed by thoracic surgery with planned future
surgical intervention. His catheterization revealed severe left
main and three vessel disease. Given the severity of his
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a
carotid duplex ultrasound which showed mild bilateral internal
carotid artery disease. On [**2127-12-5**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent off-pump coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. Over the next 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin
were resumed. Plavix was started and is to be continued for 3
months given his off-pump surgery. He resumed his hemodialysis
as per preoperatively. The renal service followed him closely
while recovering from his cardiac surgery. On postoperative day
one, he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. Lasix
was resumed at 40mg daily per the renal service and per
preoperatively. He
