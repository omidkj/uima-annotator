HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Patient is a 60-year-old diabetic male with a known history
of coronary artery disease referred for cardiac
catheterization secondary to symptoms of dyspnea on exertion
and positive stress test.  Patient had been doing well since
cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 216**] and [**2198-12-28**] with
percutaneous transluminal angiography and rota/stent.

The patient reported that he recently started to experience
dyspnea on exertion.  Patient reported recent episode of
profound shortness of breath while pushing a cart at work
recently.  The patient had also noticed increased fatigue
during sexual intercourse.  The patient denied having any
chest pain.  He had a stress test on [**2200-11-28**] during which he
exercised for eight minutes and achieved 71% of his
age-predicted heart rate.  He had diffuse baseline
electrocardiogram changes making his exercise
electrocardiogram uninterpretable for ischemia.

Nuclear imaging performed moderate reversible defect in the
anterior wall, inferior wall, and septum.  There was also a
moderate, partially reversible defect at the apex.  Transient
dilation of the left ventricle was also noted.  The patient's
ejection fraction was 34% with diffuse hypokinesis, most
severe at the apex.  The patient was referred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
2. Hyperlipidemia.
3. Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Hernia repair.
2. Penile implant.

ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
2. Atenolol 100 mg po q day.
3. Glucophage 850 mg po bid.
4. Glyburide 10 mg po bid.
5. Lipitor 10 mg po q day.
6. Zestril 20 mg po bid.
7. Imdur 30 mg po q day.
8. Multivitamin tablet q day.
9. Avandia 4 mg q day.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2200-12-19**] and underwent a cardiac catheterization.
Patient was noted to have diffuse 90% instent restenosis of
the left anterior descending artery extending beyond the
proximal left anterior descending artery stent as well as 40%
stenosis of the D1 (jailed by stent).  The patient also had
99% mid occlusion of the right coronary artery with the
distal right coronary artery filled via left to right
collaterals.

Cardiothoracic Surgery team was consulted following these
findings.  Decision was made to take the patient to the
operating room for coronary artery bypass graft.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2200-12-22**], and
underwent three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft with a
left internal mammary being grafted to the left anterior
descending artery, and with saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal and to the posterior descending artery.  The patient
was thereafter transferred to the SICU for continued
monitoring.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Floor on postoperative day #1 following an uneventful stay in
the SICU.  The patient had a temperature spike to 101.5 on
the night of postoperative day #1, and was pancultured.
Cultures were ultimately all negative for infection.

Patient was noted to making poor use of his incentive
spirometer.  The patient had an eventful day on postoperative
day #2.  Physical therapy was initiated and the patient was
able to participate well.  Patient's pain was well controlled
and his blood glucose was also well controlled.

On the night of postoperative day #2, the patient once again
spiked a temperature to 101.8.  No cultures were drawn at
this time, and the patient encouraged to make good use of his
incentive spirometry.

On postoperative day #3, the patient had two brief episodes
of atrial flutter separated in time about a minute.  The
patient's rhythm strip also indicated that the patient was
having frequent PVCs.  The patient's dose of Lopressor was
increased with no appreciable improvement in the patient's
ectopy, and the decision was made to start amiodarone on
postoperative day #4.

By postoperative day #5, the patient was deemed stable and
ready for discharge home.  By the time of discharge, the
patient was ambulating comfortably on the floor.  His pain
remained well controlled on Percocet.  He had no further
episodes of atrial flutter and his rhythm strip revealed
minimal ectopy.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:
Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 400 mg po bid.
2. Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
3. Percocet 1-2 tablets po q4-6h prn.
4. Colace 100 mg po bid.
5. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q day.
6. Lasix 20 mg po bid.
7. Potassium chloride 20 mEq po bid.
8. Metformin 850 mg po bid.
9. Rosiglitazone 4 mg po q day.
10. Atorvastatin 10 mg po q day.
11. Glyburide 10 mg po bid.

FOLLOWUP:
The patient was to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] four weeks
following discharge.  The patient was also to followup with
his primary care physician and with his cardiologist
following discharge.
