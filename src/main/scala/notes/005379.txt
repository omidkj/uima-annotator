Celexa / optiflux dialyzer

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, found to have a brain mass


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2177-7-15**]: IVC Filter
[**2177-7-15**]: removal of left IJ HD catheter
[**2177-7-19**]: Right Craniotomy and resection of mass


History of Present Illness:
This is a 60-year-old female who fell following dialysis. She
had 5 1/2 L taken off of dialysis but otherwise just did not
feel "like herself". She states that she has been having
intermittent blurry vision for weeks. Prior to the fall she was
moving a chair around, near a landing, and she placed it in such
a way that the chair has fallen, and she fell after it.
She fell forward hitting her head and back. She went into her
apartment, but was still feeling unwell so she called EMS, who
took her to [**Hospital6 **]. She never lost consciousness.
She walked fine with minimal hip pain after her fall and made it
to dialysis. She decided to go to the hospital after this and
went to [**Hospital3 **].

She had CT scans of her head and torso, and she was found to
have a 2.5 by 2.9  parietal/occiptial mass with vasogenic edema.
 She does have a history of Non-small cell lung cancer and the
fact that she prefers to get her care here.


Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
LLL mass discovered in [**2176**] at time of GI bleed. Bx at [**Hospital1 34**]
[**6-/2176**] +NSCLC. No apparent mets then, although workup suboptimal
due to "other issues" per Onc note. The lesion 7+cm, attached to
post peripheral chest wall, and moved <6mm on 4D scan, volume
was felt too large to treat quickly. IMRT plan was superior to
3D conformal plan on normal lung sparing parameters.  Per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 89344**].
= Biopsy demonstrates TTF-1-positive adenocarcinoma back in
[**2176**]. This is felt to be at least Stage IIIA, given presence of
bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and large 7cm LLL mass.
= At that time felt not to be a surgical candidate
= Recommended Rad Onc with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - recommended
further eval with mediastinoscopy prior to commiting to either
CyberKnife or external beam palliative radition. She failed to
have this done because she fell and broke her hip and was
hospitalized, then discharged to rehab on [**2177-1-11**]. Now s/p
radiation for 6 weeks.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
# CHF (ef 40% on TTE [**8-26**], class III)
# [**Month/Year (2) 2091**] - on dialysis
# CAD s/p CABG [**75**] years ago c/b sternal wound infection
# Extensive PVD
# DVT - now on Coumadin indefinitely
# Obesity
# Hyperparathyroidism
# Hypothyroidism
# Anxiety
# Type 2 DM
# COPD
# Benign Hypertension
# Anemia (Hct baseline high 20s), also had a GI bleed back in
[**2177**] requiring 12 units.

Social History:
She quit smoking 3 weeks ago (1ppd x 20 years). No etoh or IVDA.
She is disabled but formerly worked for red cross. She lives
with her husband in [**Name (NI) **].


Family History:
Sister with [**Name (NI) 2091**] on HD. Father and mother with DM. Father with
CAD

Imaging:

From [**Hospital6 33**]:
- CT head: 2.5 x 2.9 mass centered within subcortical white
matter at the junction of the right posterior parietal and
occiipital lobes. surrounding vasogenic edema extending into the
posterior superior right temporal lobe. mass effect compressing
the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and < 5 mm midline shift from the right
to the left at the level of the septum pellucidum. no fx
- CT abd w/ contrast: no acute abdominal process.
- CT chest w/ contrast: 3.1 cm diameter partially calcified
pleural based mass at the low posterior left lower lobe, at the
site of previously dx lung cancer.
- renal is aware of patient, no need for urgent dialysis

XRAY [**2177-7-11**]: Four Views of lumbar spine: revela diffuse bone
demineralization. No evidence of Acute compression fracture,
disc space narrowing or spondylolisthesiis. There is mild low
lumbar facet osteoparthropathy. Vascular calcifications are
noted.

[**Hospital1 18**] IMAGING:

[**2177-7-12**] CT C-spine without contrast
1.  No acute fracture of the cervical spine. Markedly rotated
position and mild motion limit assessment of symmetry of
structures. No canal or foraminal stenosis.
2.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery segment consistent
with pulmonary hypertension with associated mild cardiac
decompensation.
3. T3 (thoracic 3) vertebral body- mild anterior wedging and
superior
end-plate depression.  Correlate clinically for dedicated
imaging.

CXR PA and Lateral [**2177-7-12**]

1.  Airspace opacity in the left lower lobe, consistent with
pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
2.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, consistent with
diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Cardiomegaly and interstitial edema consistent with mild
congestive heart failure.

CT Head w/o contrast [**2177-7-12**]
3.1 x 2.7 cm right parieto-occipital mass with extensive
neighboring edema and moderate neighboring mass effect but no
evidence for herniation.

CT Head with contrast [**2177-7-13**]
A 3.1 x 2.8 cm mass centered in the right parieto-occipital
region with avid peripheral enhancement and extensive
surrounding vasogenic edema compatible with metastatic disease
given the history.

[**7-15**] ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical septal
akinesis, apical anterior akinesis/hypokinesis, distal apical
akinesis/dyskinesis and inferoseptal hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**7-18**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:  Stable 3.3 cm right parieto-occipital
mass compatible with a history of metastatic lung cancer.

[**7-19**] CXR: FINDINGS:  The right-sided hemodialysis catheter has
been removed.  The left chest AICD is in place.  There continues
to be some retrocardiac opacity that could be due to volume loss
or infiltrate.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  Overall, the
appearance is similar compared to the study from five days ago.

[**7-19**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:  Expected postoperative parietal
craniotomy changes.
