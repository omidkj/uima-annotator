Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Coumadin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope, Fall, altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 y.o. female with history of hypertension and
syncope admitted status post witnessed fall where she struck her
head and intubated for agitation and altered mental status.  Per
report, the patient was walking in a public place when she was
noted to lose consciousness and collapse. Those who noted her
falling thought she struck her head on the pavement when she
fell. Her blood glucose in the field was 156.

On arrival to the ED, her vitals were BP 190/83, HR 100 (atrial
fibrillation), T 98.6.  Her mental status was altered and she
was extremely combative.  The patient was intubated in the ED
using etomidate and succinycholine and then was started on
propofol drip for sedation.  Her lactate was initially elevated
to >8 but she was fighting violently when arrived and after
hydration this descreased to 4.4.  She was afebrile with a white
count of 11.3. Urinalysis, head CT, chest radiograph, and ECG
all failed to suggest an acute process to explain her altered
mental status.  After intubation she continued to remain quite
agitated but was eventually fully sedated with propofol.  She
was admitted to the ICU.

RADIOLOGY RESULTS
=================
ECG [**2196-2-15**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Consider right atrial abnormality. Low limb
lead voltage.  ST segment depression. Clinical correlation is
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.

Chest and Pelvis Radiograph [**2196-2-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intrathoracic abnormality.
2. Distal tip of endotracheal tube at the inferior margin of the
clavicles,
4.7 cm above the carina.
3. Emphysema.
4. Limited view of the pelvis without overt fracture. If there
is concern for pelvic fracture, repeat radiograph is
recommended.

Pelvis Radiograph [**2196-2-15**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture.

CT Head w/o Contrast [**2196-2-15**]:
1. No fracture, hemorrhage, or edema.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
3. Age-related parenchymal involutional change.

CT C-Spine [**2196-2-15**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of traumatic injury to the cervical
spine. Severe
emphysema.

Carotid Ultrasound [**2196-2-16**]:

internal carotid
arteries bilaterally.

Chest Radiograph [**2196-2-16**]:
There is mild cardiomegaly. The lungs are hyperinflated.
Atelectases are in
the left base. Right lower lobe opacity could be due to
pneumonia or
aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 89 year old female with history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and unexplained syncope who was brought to the
ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.

1) Syncope -  The patient has had multiple episodes of syncope
and the etiology of these episodes remains unclear despite an
extensive work-up at another hospital.  The cause of this
particular event is similarly unclear.  The patient has had
previous echocardiograms, holter monitors, and a stress test,
which have all been negative for a source of syncope.  The
patient was ruled out for MI at her presentation here (despite
elevated CK's and borderline elevated troponin, MB remained flat
and these other elevations considered more consistent with fall
and struggle).  Cerebrovascular causes of syncope could include
TIA though this would be extremely rare unless there was
bilateral disease.  Given concern unilateral disease could cause
brief hemiparesis and fall, carotid ultrasounds (previously
performed at [**Hospital3 **]) were repeated and remained negative.
Although she had a previous benign EEG at an outside hospital
there was also some concern the patient could be having seizures
given post-fall confusion with elevated CPKs.  In an elderly
woman most likely causes of new seizure would be infection or
new mass lesion vs anatomic abnormality. As her picture was not
consistent with infection and she had no fever, leukocytosis, or
meningismus, her brain was imaged with CT and MRI.  Neither
imaging modality revealed an acute process.  Orthostasic
hypotension could be another common etiology of loss of
conscious in elderly individuals but these episodes do not sound
consistent with orthostasis as they do not happen just on
standing but after she has been walking for some time.
Ultimately, etiology of syncope is unclear but the patient does
have severe COPD and despite being recommended home O2 in the
past she has refused this.  In the hospital the patient was
noted to become hypoxemic on ambulation without supplementary
oxygen.  It was considered likely the patient has had hypoxemia
at home and this may explain her syncopal episodes.  The patient
was discharged on supplementary O2.

2) Altered Mental Status - Per the patient's son her baseline
mental status is generally alert and oriented *3 with mild
memory deficits but the patient is able to take care of herself.
 At presentation she was extremely agitated and combative with
minimal awareness.  CT head ruled out acute intracranial bleed,
and infectious work-up was ultimately negative, except for small
infiltrate possibly consistent with pneumonia. The patient was
never febrile and lactate trended down quickly with hydration,
making severe infection less likely.  She was extubated on
hospital day 2 and at that time was at her baseline mental
status.  Most likely etiology of altered mental status was
considered to be post-concussion syndrome vs persistent
hypoxemia.  B12 and tox screen were both within normal limits
ruling out other possible metabolic cau
