History of Present Illness:
74 yo man with a recent diagnosis of MDS, now presenting with
SOB and found to have AML and cardiac tamponade.

Fatigue and shortness of breath have been progressive over the
last week of [**Month (only) 547**]. Initially thought to be due to anemia so he
was offered transfusion and refused this. His SOB continued to
worsen so he presented to clinic on [**3-29**]. His sx were so severe
that even mild activity, such as changing clothes, was
exhausting. He also admitted to chest pain which he described as
a racing heartbeat without pressure or sharp pain. There were no
associated sx of N/V, diaphoresis, or radiating pain but he did
have LE edema x past few weeks. In clinic, vitals were notable
for an oxygen saturation 97%-100%, HR 109, T 99 and he appeared
distressed. Labs significant for new WBC of 17, up from 1K one
week prior, with 80% other cells, concerning for leukemic
transformation of MDS. He was admitted to the BMT service. A TTE
was obtained which showed cardiac tamponade so he was taken for
drainage. 250cc bloody fluid was removed. There was a piece of
tissue-like material within the pericardial fluid as well which
was sent for pathology. Opening pressure was 10, after drainage
was negative. post-drain echo did not show fluid but showed
hyperdynamic septum. No right heart cath was done. Pt was
transferred to the CCU for monitoring s/p drainage and felt
well.
.
ROS: Positive per HPI and for 6 lb weight loss over 3 weeks,
urinary frequency. Also for R sided neck strain. Negative for
fevers, chills, NS, abdominal pain, N/V, diarrhea, black or
bloody stools, myalgias, arthralgias, dysurea, hematuria,
dizziness or syncope.

STUDIES:
ECHO ([**2117-3-29**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. There is brief right atrial
diastolic collapse. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pericardial effusion with evidence of
elevated intrapericardial pressures. Normal biventricular
systolic function.

Cardiac Cath ([**2117-3-29**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Pericardiocentesis performed via subxyphoid approach using
blunt
tipped needle. Pericardial location confirmed using by echo
using
agitated saline. Initial pericardial pressure of 8 mmHg. We
removed
250cc of serosanguinous fluid and left drain in place. Post
pericardial
pressure of 0 mmHg. The patient tolerated the procedure well and
was
transferred to CCU in stable condition.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology by
echo.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with removal of 250cc of fluid,
sent
for routine labs and cytology.
