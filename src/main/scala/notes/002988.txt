History of Present Illness:
75 year old female c/o dyspnea on
exertion since summer [**2186**]. Developed congestive heart failure

PREBYPASS
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully
coapt. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
LV systolic function is preserved. The is a ring prosthesis in
the mitral position . MR is now mild. RV systolic function
remains mildly depressed. There is a ring prosthesis in the
tricuspid position. TR is mild. The remaining study is unchanged
from the prebypass period.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted one day prior to surgery for
pre-admission testing and heparin bridge.  She was brought to
the operating room on [**2187-12-18**] where she underwent mitral valve
repair and tricuspid valve repair with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on neo and propofol
for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the patient
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  She
was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no
inotropic or vasopressor support.  Chest tubes and pacing wires
were discontinued without complication.  Coumadin was resumed
for atrial fibrillation.  She was diuresed toward her
preoperative weight and beta-blockade was initiated.  She does
have a history of chronic pleural effusions, and this was
closely followed by CXR following removal of chest tubes.
Diuresis was adjusted accordingly for pleural effusions and
significant lower extremity edema.  She will follow up in one
week with a chest x-ray.  The patient progressed without
complication, and was cleared by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge to
**** on POD ******.
