Service:  VASCULAR SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right groin and back pain of acute onset.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year-old male
status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2139**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1274**] who presents with right groin pain and back pain.
The pain began yesterday afternoon.  He denies any chest
pain, shortness of breath.  He denies nausea, vomiting or
diarrhea.  The patient denies any cardiac history.  He is
admitted to the Emergency Room and on Vascular Service for
urgent abdominal exploration.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, two transient ischemic
attacks.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in
[**2139**], renal artery aneurysm repair in [**2144**], carotid
endarterectomy in [**2155**], transurethral resection of the
prostate remote.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Labetalol 200 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, reaction unknown.  Clindamycin causes
gastrointestinal upset.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was comfortable.  Heart
was regular rate and rhythm with a 2 out of 6 systolic
ejection murmur.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdominal examination was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  No discreet mass palpated.  Well healed median
line incision.  Extremities warm and perfuse.  No edema.
Pulse examination was 2+ pulses bilaterally.  Popliteals,
dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial pulses were
palpable, but diminished.  Neurological is intact.

LABORATORY:  CBC white blood cell count 10.6, hematocrit
46.5, platelets 237K, PT/INR and PTT were normal, BUN 17,
creatinine 1.2, K 4.8.  Urinalysis was negative.  CAT scan
was obtained of the abdomen, which showed an 8 by 4 aneurysm
at the bifurcation of the aorta and a right iliac artery
aneurysm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit and hemodynamic lines were placed.  Blood
pressure control was begun.  The patient was placed on a
Nipride drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure of less
then 120, beta blockade would be done postoperatively.  The
patient had a right IJ and PA Swan catheter placed.  He
underwent emergent abdominal exploration with a repair of
abdominal aortic aneurysm with a aortobifemoral bypass graft.
 He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells, 1 unit of
platelets and 2 fresh frozen platelets and 2500 cc from the
Cellsaver intraoperatively.  Findings showed aneurysm distal
to the distal anastomosis of the tube graft.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  He was transferred to the SICU
in guarded, but stable condition intubated.  The patient was
continued on perioperative Kefzol.  He required intravenous
nitroglycerin for systolic blood pressure control.  There
were no overnight events.  They did require transfusion of
red blood cells postoperatively.  Hematocrit of 29.  His
white blood cell count was 15, BUN 18, creatinine 1.1, K 5.0,
PT, INR and PTT were normal.

He remained in the SICU for continued hemodynamic monitoring.
Serial troponin levels were obtained postoperatively.  He
peaked at 3.7 and over the next 24 hours came down to 2.  He
required continued respiratory support.  There was an episode
of bronchospasm.  Blood gas was 7.35, 41, 125, 29, -2 on PEEP
of [**11-10**].5.  The patient's hematocrit remained stable after
transfusion with a hematocrit of 28.5, BUN and creatinine
continued to remain stable.  Potassium returned to baseline
after supplementation.  He continued to remain NPO with
nasogastric in place.  Postoperative day three he continued
to remain in the SICU and continued on intravenous Lopressor
and nitroglycerin.  He was placed on CPAP with pressure
support 7.5/12, FIO2 was 0.5.  Blood gases were 7.35, 41,
125, 24-2.  Hematocrit remained stable at 28.5.  BUN and
creatinine continued to show increase in the BUN to 31 and
creatinine to 1.3.  His CKs remained flat.  His CKMBs
remained flat.  His troponin remained stable.

Abdominal examination was softly distended, bowel sounds were
not present and there was no flatus.  He continued NPO with
nasogastric suction.  Postoperative day three he was
extubated, fluids were kept at KVO.  He was diuresed with
Lasix times three doses.  He received one unit of packed red
blood cells for his hematocrit of 26.3 down from 28.5.  BUN
and creatinine remained stable at 32 and 1.3, K was 3.8,
which was supplemented.  PT/INR were normal.  Glucose is
fasting remained less then 125.  His nasogastric was removed.
He remained NPO.  He required increasing doses of Lopressor
for his hypertension and adjustment in his Labetalol dosing.
The Swan-Ganz was discontinued.  He continued to remain
stable.  On postoperative day number four he required 2 units
of packed red blood cells for his hematocrit of 28.3.  Her
required Lasix, dropped intravenous to begin, blood gases
were 7.35, 46, 89, 28, +1.  His BUN remained at 31 with a
creatinine that improved to 1.2.  He did have bowel sounds
present on examination.  Lopressor required increased dosing
for systolic hypertension and he continued on his
nitroglycerin drip.  He remained NPO except for medications
and he remained in the SICU.  His right cordis was changed on
[**2155-12-25**] without complications to a triple lumen catheter.

By postoperative day five his troponin level was 0.8, total
CK was 136, MBs were negative.  He continued to require O2 by
nasal cannula and a shovel mask.  Blood gases were 7.5, 33,
69, 27, 2.  His hematocrit remained stable at 29.3 post
transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells.  He continued to
remain NPO.  He required some Diamox times three doses for
assistance in diuresis and fluid mobilization.  Her remained
in the Intensive Care Unit.  On postoperative day six his
gases improved at 7.45, 34, 84, 24, base excess is 0.  His
hematocrit was 32.  White blood cell count had jumped to 14
from 11.7, BUN was 37, creatinine 1.1, which was stable.
Diamox was discontinued and his diet was begun on clears and
advanced as tolerated.  Nutritional support with total
parenteral nutrition was begun.  The patient required
reintubation on [**2155-12-28**].  Chest x-ray showed patchy
atelectasis on the right side.  There was a question of
whether the patient had aspirated.  His antibiotics were
continued.  His Lasix intravenous was discontinued.  He
continued on a total parenteral nutrition and remained in the
SICU for continued monitoring and care.

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2155-12-28**].  There was
noted increased secretions on the right middle lobe.
Cultures were sent.  The left side was without pathology.  He
tolerated the bronchoscopy.  During his SICU stay physical
therapy did follow the patient and began range of motion
exercises.  Postoperative day eight the patient continued to
remain in metabolic acidosis.  He was continued on
Levofloxacin and Ceptaz for his right lung infiltrate.  His
white blood cell count remained stable at 15.5, hematocrit
30.7, BUN 40 and creatinine 1.6.  X-rays now showed bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates.  Sputum cultures showed 1+ gram
negative rods.  Adjustments were made in his total parenteral
nutrition and the patient remained intubated and NPO.  His
sputum culture grew Pseudomonas and gram negative rods.  On
[**12-28**] and [**12-26**] sputum culture grew Pseudomonas Serratia.  He
was continued on Ceptaz, Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone was
discontinued.  Blood, urine and cordis cultures were all
negative.  His white count was 14.0, polys 78, bands 2,
lymphocytes 8, monocytes 2, eosinophils 8, basophils 0.  His
creatinine remained stable at 1.0.  Post pyloric tube was
placed on [**12-30**].  He was continued on his total parenteral
nutrition and tube feeds were begun.

The patient's tube feeds were not instituted secondary he was
still intubated on [**2155-12-31**].  He did have episodes over the
next several days of episodic hypotension requiring
adjustment in his beta blockade.  White blood cell count
continued to rise to 16.7 on postoperative day 12.  The
patient's respiratory secretions improved.  He continued to
remain intubated on CPAP and nutritional support by total
parenteral nutrition.  Repeat sputum cultu
