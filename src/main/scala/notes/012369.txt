History of Present Illness:
62 yo man with PMH of CAD, DM2, Bipolar d/o, COPD, ETOH
cirrhosis, transferred from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital today after
multiple ICD shocks. He was discharged last week from [**Hospital1 18**]
after VT arrest and intubation which was thought to be secondary
to hypokalemia. He had an ablation study for which he had a
non-tolerated inducible VT. He had an ablation from the inferior
wall base to the mid inferior wall. He was discharged after ICD
placement on metoprolol XL 150mg daily. He says that since he
has been home, he has been feeling very anxious and not sleeping
well. Patient admits to significant smoking and coffee drinking
up to 10 cups per day. He says he has been taking all of his
medications including metoprolol. (He has not been able to get
his zyprexa.) Around 4AM he felt sudden onset of lightheadedness
and then his ICD fired. Hours later he felt lightheaded again
and the ICD fired another time. At this point, he went to
[**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital.
.
At [**Location (un) **], his initial vitals were BP 124/98, HR 87, RR 18,
O2sat 96% on 2L NC. He had a CXR which was a poor study but was
clear per ED attg at OSH (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. While being evaluated by
the ED physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] felt lightheaded again and was shocked. The
ED physician at [**Name9 (PRE) **] reports that he was shocked over 15
times. They gave him a 100mg bolus of lidocaine with no effect.
They gave him ativan (total 3mg) for anxiety then started a
procainamide gtt with bolus and then 2mg/min. During the 1g
bolus of procainamide, he started having a wide QRS complex
without being shocked. This converted to sinus. Then prior to
departure on [**Location (un) **], he had a wide complex tachycardia at 160
bpm and was transiently hypotensive. His ICD fired and he went
to a sinus rhythm.
.
In our ED, his vitasl were BP 113/86, HR 90, RR 16, O2sat 100%
RA, T 98.2. His potassium was 3.4 and he was given 10mEq of
potassium IV and sent to the CCU for further care.

Cardiac History:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2138**] and [**2143**] anatomy as
follows:
posterior LV branch stent at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2138**]. Consequently, the
inferoposterior wall of his heart is severely hypokinetic and
his ejection fraction remains at 40%.  He was evaluated with
cardiac catherization [**2143-4-9**] which demonstarted 90% R-PDA
lesion that was stented with a bare metal stent. The  80% lesion
in the posterior LV branch could not be treated as balloons
would not deliver into that vessel.


Social History:
Patient is divorced and lives alone. He worked as a concession
manager in the carnival business but due to medical issues has
not worked since last Spring. Patient has smoked up to 2-3 packs
a day for approximately 35-40 years. He is currently smoking one
pack a day.
His parents are deceased.  He has a biological son who is
currently in prision in PA.  He did not have this son with his
ex-wife.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for acute c hange

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old man with v tach and aicd firing
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for acute c hange
SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST [**2145-5-6**].

HISTORY: 62-year-old man with ventricular tachycardia and AICD
"firing"; evaluate for acute change.

FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "supine" is
compared with recent studies dated [**4-29**] and [**2145-4-25**]. There is
now veil-like opacity involving the left hemithorax, likely
representing posterior layering of the laterally-layering
effusion, demonstrated previously. The right lung remains
relatively clear and the heart size and pulmonary vessels are,
overall, unchanged. Left-sided dual-chamber ICD/pacing device
has intact leads in unchanged position; note that the right
atrial lead followed an unusual course, directed posteriorly, on
the previous lateral view. Again demonstrated are old fracture
deformities of the right fourth through eighth ribs, laterally.

IMPRESSION:
1. Posteriorly-layering left pleural effusion, likely unchanged
since [**4-29**].
2. No significant change in heart size and pulmonary vessels.
3. Possible aberrant positioning of the right atrial lead of the
ICD/pacer device (as communicated previously, by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Please eval effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old man with ICD firing/VT. Had recent LLL pneumonia and
thoracentesis for left effusion.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval effusion
INDICATION: 62-year-old man with ventricular tachycardia and
recent left lower lobe pneumonia, please evaluate for effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2145-5-6**].

UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The dual-lead left AICD is unchanged.
The cardiomediastinal silloutte is stable and unremarkable.
There is a moderate- sized left pleural effusion, which allowing
for positional change is similar in size to [**2145-5-6**]. Stable
associated mild left lower lobe atelectasis is noted. The right
lung is clear.
.
Atrial paced and ventricularly sensed rhythm at 60 beats per
minute. Compared
to the previous tracing atrial pacing is new.
