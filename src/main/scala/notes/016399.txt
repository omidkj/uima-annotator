 She lives with her daugther who helps he rwith ADLs, is
normally able to ambulate with a cane, but currently finds this
too painful.  She does report feeling cold, but no fevers, night

Discharge labs

Radiology:
[**2162-4-1**] CXR
Findings suggesting moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
.
[**2162-4-1**] Bilateral LENI
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left legs,
however, the calf veins could not be visualized due to overlying
edema.
.
[**2162-4-2**] Echocardiogram
Mild symmetric LVH with normal global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Mild aortic stenosis. Moderate aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-11-11**],
mitral regurgitation is slightly more prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo F Greek-speaking female with a history of afib on
coumadin, torsades, chronic diastolic CHF, HTN, DM2, COPD, and
ILD admitted with heart failure exacerbation and severe
hypertension, transferred to the CCU with worsening kidney
function. After family meeting, the decision was made to pursue
comfort measurse only and she was discharged home with hospice.
.
# CHF: Patient was grossly fluid overloaded on admission, CXR
shows pulmonary edema, BNP elevated>16,000.  Unclear whether
underlying trigger such as MI or medication non-compliance.
Creatinine elevated from [**Year (4 digits) 5348**], likely [**2-11**] CHF exacerbation.
Poor response to IV lasix boluses, necessitating transfer to the
cardiology service for a lasix drip.  An echocardiogram which
showed slightly worse mitral regurgitation in comparison to
prior echo. On the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, lasix ggt was initially started
at 10mg/hr, but given poor UOP eventually increased to 20mg/hr,
also with addition of metolazone 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Her creatinine
continued to increase, and UOP decreased. The renal team was
consulted and she was transferred in the CCU. Her UOP continued
to be poor on lasix drip as she continued to be more fluid
overloaded. Only able to diurese about a liter during her CCU
stay. Given her worsening kidney function and heart failure, a
family meeting was held to discuss goals of care. The patient's
wishes appeared to be stopping treatment and going home. Her son
agreed with these goals and she was discharged home with
hospice. She was discharged with olanzapine and ativan to use as
needed for anxiety and agitation.
.
# Hypertensive urgency: BP elevated at around 220s systolic on
the night of [**2162-4-1**], requiring total 50 mg IV hydralazine to
bring SBP down to 180s.  Patient was asymptomatic.  We continue
her clonidine and isosorbide and uptitrated isosorbide to 240 mg
daily.  HCTZ was discontinued since CrCl was approx 15 ml/min.
Beta blocker not started due to heart failue and ACE inhibitor
not started due to chronic renal failure. On [**4-2**] she again had
SBP > 200, and a nitro ggt was started, as well as her home dose
of clonidine, and hydralazine PO. This worked well for 24 hours,
with SBP's around 150's. On [**4-3**], she became hypertensive again
with SBP's 185-205. At this point she became confused and
combative, and refused all PO meds and pulled her IV's out. IV's
replaced and nitro gtt uptitrated to max, but she was no longer
responsive to this. IV hydral given without sufficient response.
She was thus transferred to the CCU for better control of her
hypertension. In the CCU, she continued to refuse PO medications
intermittently. Even when she was ablet to take them, her blood
pressure would rarely go below 180. As her kidney function
worsened, it was clear that her volume status was a large factor
in her blood pressure. Renal consult felt she was not a
candidate for dialysis given it was against her wishes. She was
discharged home on hospice with clonidine, hydralazine and
amlodipine.
.
# Chronic renal failure: Creatinine at 3.0 on admission,
slightly elevated from recent discharge creatinine of around
2
