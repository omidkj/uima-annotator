Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old man
with a history of nonflow limiting three vessel disease,
status post multiple catheterizations, PCIs for angina with
stent most recently two years ago.  Patient has a history of
hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia.  He was in his
usual state of health until early when he awoke with
diaphoresis, shortness of breath, difficulty speaking.  EMT
was called and patient was found to be in complete heart
block with heart rate of 20.  His blood pressure at that time
was 80/42.  He was given atropine with no response.  He was
externally paced at 66 beats per minute and his systolic
blood pressure was 150.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for one month of intermittent
episodes of dizziness, worse over the last week with
diaphoresis.  His recent medical evaluation reveals one
episode of vaguely induced syncope one month ago, but
otherwise normal electrocardiogram within the last 30 days
per primary care physician's evaluation.  His last cardiac
catheterization was in [**2107-5-16**] and it showed an ejection
fraction of 55%, posterior descending artery with 50%
stenosis, his mid left anterior descending was 50% stenosed,
proximal left anterior descending was 30% stenosed.  His
first diagonal was 30% stenosed, left circumflex 30% at OMI.
Stress in [**2108-8-15**] showed angina, 7/10 chest pain
without electrocardiogram changes.  No nuclear mild fixed
inferior wall defect.  Echocardiogram in [**2107-3-16**] showed
mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mild mitral regurgitation
with borderline aortic stenosis. Review of systems is
significant for increased angina and dyspnea on exertion,
decreased exercise tolerance, two pillow orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, swelling in the lower
extremities and his last anginal attack was one day prior to
admission relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.  He has
been requiring increased Lasix doses recently for his lower
extremity edema. He denies melena, bright red blood per
rectum or pain in his arms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
3.  Borderline diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Muscular dystrophy, [**Doctor Last Name **] type, diagnosed six to seven
years ago with chronically elevated CK.
6.  Osteoarthritis.
7.  Syncope.
8.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10. Depressi on.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Imdur 30 q.d., Flomax 0.4 q.d.,
Effexor SR 75 b.i.d., seroquel 25 q.d., Klonopin, aspirin 325
q.d., Lasix 20 q.d., Glucophage 500 q.d. Monday, Wednesday
and Friday, Toprol 50 q.d., Atenolol 50 q.d., Vioxx 50 q.d.,
Zestril 10 q.d., Zocor 10 q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, normal
S1, S2, 2/6 systolic murmur at right sternal border with
radiation to carotids.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  No crackles.  Abdomen obese with good bowel
sounds, high pitch, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:
2+ pitting edema, good perfusion, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Neurological:  Alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORIES:  Chem-7:  Sodium 135, potassium 5.0, chloride
98, bicarbonate 23, BUN 33, creatinine 1.0, glucose 200.
CBC:  9.4, 14.3, 40.9, 129.  His CK was 89 with an MB of 10.
His troponin was less than 0.3.  His PT 13.6, PTT 25.2, INR
1.3.

Chest x-ray was a limited exam that showed no evidence of
congestive heart failure or infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 73-year-old man with a history of
coronary artery disease, muscular dystrophy who presents with
new onset of complete heart block.

1.  Cardiovascular system:  Complete heart block, ischemic
versus sequela of muscular dystrophy leading to conduction
abnormality versus excess beta-blocker.  A transvenous pacer
was placed, but patient had already converted back to sinus,
likely from a sympathetic surge during the IJ attempt.  His
beta-blocker was held.  He was monitored on telemetry.  EPS
study was done and a DDD pacer was placed without
complications and chest x-ray showed the pacer was in the
proper placement.  He was given vancomycin intravenously
times four doses.

On [**8-13**], after the pacemaker was placed, he developed
heart rate in the 140s with palpitations and shortness of
breath.  He did not have any chest pain or diaphoresis.
Patient was given Metoprolol 75 po times one with 25 in the
evening and then on the 31st he was started on Toprol XL 75
mg po q.d.  Patient's rate came back down to the 80s and he
was stable.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was ruled out by
enzymes.  He was continued on aspirin, Isordil, Lisinopril.

3.  Pump:  He is continued on Lasix 20 q.d.  His
echocardiogram was repeated on [**8-13**] which showed an
ejection fraction of 40-45%, hypokinesis of the basal,
inferior and inferolateral walls, no AR and no MI.

4.  Pulmonary:  Patient was saturating well on room air.

5.  Endocrinology:  He had a history of "borderline
diabetes."  His glucoses were normal without any medications
between 80 and 113.

6.  Hematology:  His hematocrit remained above 30.  During
the hospitalization, he did not require transfusions.

7.  Psychiatry:  Depression:  He was continued on his
outpatient Seroquel and Effexor.

8.  Renal:  His BUN and creatinine were stable.

9.  Prophylaxis:  He was continued on subcutaneous heparin
and pantoprazole.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He was full code and he was discharged
home with follow-up at the Device Clinic on Tuesday, [**8-20**], at 1 p.m. to be followed up by Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Complete heart block.
