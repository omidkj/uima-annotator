Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4358**]
Chief Complaint:
septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year old male who initially presented 4 days prior
to admission with right upper quadrant pain.  On the night prior
to admission, he developed fevers to 100, then on the morning of
admission, fevers progressed to near 101 accompanied by shaking
chills.  His family took him to [**Hospital3 **], where a right
upper quadrant ultrasound revealed gallstones and fluid around
the gallbladder.  He was treated initially with ceftriaxone,
ciprofloxacin, and flagyl.  He became hypotensive to the 70s and
80s at the OSH and was started on norepinephrine.  Given
persistent hypotension, he was also started on phenylephrine.
Mr [**Known lastname 91641**] was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], he was febrile with temperatures to 101;
LFTs were also noted to be elevated with ALT of 152 and AST of
178 with normal alkaline phosphatase.  CT abdomen was obtained
which revealed stones in the gallbladder with mild gallbladder
stranding but no cystic duct or CDB ductal dilation.  No obvious
signs of cholecystis or cholangitis on imaging.  Upon arrival to
the MICU, he had no active complaints; he denied abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, or feeling feverish.  He did state he has not
moved his bowels in several days.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
         Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available
on request.
