Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 23753**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea,vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation [**1-14**]

History of Present Illness:
In brief, Mw. [**Known lastname 24127**] is a 45 yo with HIV/AIDS (CD4 count of 18
[**2144-12-17**], VL >100k on [**2144-10-25**], many OI, noncompliant with [**Date Range 2775**]
for past 3 years), known [**Doctor First Name **] infection (positive BCX [**2144-9-25**],
positive [**Month/Day/Year **] [**2144-9-17**]), for which she has been noncompliant
with treatment( biaxin/ethambutol), recent diagnosis of likely
PML (T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal white matter on head
MRI [**2144-12-19**]), recent dx HSV-2 (from L labial culture [**2144-9-16**]),
who presents with fever, n/v, fatigue, dehydration that started
1 week PTA and failure to thrive. Pt. and family had family
meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her PCP and ID doc, yesterday, and
decision was made to have pt. admitted to begin treatment and
eventually send her to HIV [**Hospital1 **] at [**Hospital **] Hospital for
continued medication monitoring and nutritional support.
.
Pt. has had severe nausea, vomiting, fatigue with fevers/chills,
non productive cough, poor appetite. She denies any abdominal,
head, or neck pain, chest pain, shortness of breath,
constipation or diarrhea. She also denies any confusion or
increased sleepiness, though per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] yesterday's meeting she
was somnolent.
.
In the ED, the pt refused LP (has a h/o doing this on prior
admits). She was found to have fever 102F, dehydration with very
conc urine, clear CXR, head CT with unchanged appearance of
likely PML, WBC 1.9k with 73% PMNs (no bands), nl lactate. She
was started empirically on Vanc and CTX in the ED after cultures
drawn for possible bacteremia.
.
Of note, pt. has blood cx. from mycolytic cx. from 12.28 growing
AFB organism, likely to be [**Name10 (NameIs) **]. She also had very complete w/u
over many months with similar sx. with negative CMV, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **],
cryptococcal ag.
.
She also had desats to 60% last night. She improved to 90% on
6L, then 98% on NRB, after which she coughed up a large bit of
[**Name10 (NameIs) **], and sats gradually rose to current o2 sat.

Past Medical History:
- HIV/AIDS, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2775**] planned to be started, but not compliant
- complicated by PCP pneumonia, positive PPD, herpes zoster, HIV
retinopathy, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] on [**Name10 (NameIs) **] culture X 3 ([**Date range (1) 24126**]), in blood
cx. in [**9-25**], and AFB positive culture from [**2144-12-17**] prelim.
- PID
- h/o polysubstance abuse sober >20 years
- Biventricular heart failure, work-up during prior admission
with normal TFTs, negative Lyme, exercise MIBI without perfusion
defect [**9-25**]. EF 10-15%/ cardiologist: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 171**]/[**Hospital1 18**]
- Genital HSV type 2, status post 10-day course of Valacyclovir
during [**Month (only) **]/06 hospitalization
- Likely PML by MRI [**2144-12-19**]
.

Social History:
h/o PSA; denies any current smoking, etoh, drug use
has two sons/one incarcerated/other very supportive: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**]

Renal Ultrasound [**2145-1-12**]
IMPRESSION: Diffusely echogenic kidneys, which are on the upper
limits of normal for size, suggestive of an underlying
nephropathy. No evidence of hydronephrosis or abnormal mass.
.
ECHO [**2145-1-14**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
small. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen.
Impression: severe cardiomyopathy; small pericardial effusion
(no tamponade);
small right ventricle with collapsed inferior vena cava
indicating
intravascular volume depletion
Head CT:
FINDINGS: There are no areas of abnormal enhancement. Again seen
is a focal area of low attenuation in the left frontal
periventricular white matter. Otherwise, the density values of
the brain parenchyma are within normal limits. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. The surrounding osseous and
soft tissue structures are unremarkable. The imaged paranasal
sinuses are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No ring enhancing lesions or abscesses identified.
Again seen is a focal low attenuation region in the left
ventricular white matter which could represent PML or sequelae
of prior infection. Much less likely would be microvascular
ischemic changes given the distribution.
.
[**2144-12-19**] MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: There is mild prominence of sulci and ventricles
inappropriate for patient's age. There is a focus of
hyperintense T2 signal seen in the left corona radiata adjacent
to the left lateral ventricle which is the area demonstrated on
CT as hypointensity. There is no abnormal enhancement seen in
this region. There are no other areas of abnormal enhancement
identified. There is an incidental developmental venous anomaly
seen on the left periventricular region. Diffusion images
demonstrate no evidence of acute infarcts.
IMPRESSION: Approximately 1.5 x 1 cm focus of T2 hyperintensity
in the left frontal white matter of nonspecific nature. There is
no enhancement seen in this region. Although the appearances are
not typical for PML, this diagnosis should be considered given
patient's clinical history. Absence of enhancement is against
lymphoma or act
