ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Ileus and question of ischemic ostomy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post perforated sigmoid with sigmoid resection,
colostomy and Hartmann's, [**2131-11-3**] at an outside hospital
with Hartmann's breakdown.  Transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation.
2. Small bowel obstruction.
3. Breakdown of Hartmann's with abscess collection, fascial
dehiscence with take back to the operating room for closure
of fascia and pelvic washout, [**2131-11-13**].
4. Clostridium difficile positive on [**12-11**].
5. [**Hospital **] hospital acquired pneumonia, on antibiotics.
6. Prolonged postoperative ileus.
7. Bradycardia of unclear etiology, likely secondary to
vasovagal episode.
8. Malnutrition requiring total parenteral nutrition.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
male with a very complicated past medical history.  He was
seen at an outside hospital where he was found to have a
perforated sigmoid colon.  He underwent a sigmoid resection
with colostomy and Hartmann's on [**2131-11-3**].  Intraoperatively,
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed.

The postop course was complicated by a rise in INR to 4
requiring 8 of FFP.  He was also noticed to have some
abdominal tenderness and a dusky ostomy, and thus a CT scan
was performed which showed ileus and no fluid collection.
The family requested transfer on postop day #5 to [**Hospital6 1760**] where the patient came for
further care and evaluation.

1. Hypertension.
2. PMR.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies tobacco or ETOH.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for father dying of colon cancer at
age 67.

EXAM ON ADMISSION:  The patient is afebrile.  His vital signs
are normal.  He is anicteric.  His lungs are clear with
decreased breath sounds at the bases.  His heart is regular.
His abdomen is distended, diffusely tender, with some
inferior ecchymosis and erythema around his wound.
Extremities have some painful varicosities and 2+ pitting
edema.  Rectal - the anastomosis is not palpated.  Some gross
positive blood was found.  The ostomy was darkish, was dusky
in color, with flatus in the bag.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated on
[**2131-11-7**].  It was thought that he had a postop ileus.  There
was also question of slightly dusky ostomy, although when it
was cannulated with a test tube, the mucosa appeared to be
pink proximal to the area that was in question.

The patient was admitted and underwent a CT scan which showed
a stable collection in his pelvis.  The patient was followed
closely,  and given the fact that several days into his
hospital course his wound began to open, it became clear that
he had a fascial dehiscence.  On [**2131-11-13**], he was taken to
the OR for an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and
repair of his Hartmann's which was seen to have broken down,
as well as a pelvic washout.

The patient did well postoperatively.  He was cared for in
the ICU and then transferred to the floor.  He was placed on
broad-spectrum antibiotics given the collection in his
abdomen.  He did have a prolonged ileus postop, and was
placed on TPN.  Slowly, however, his bowel function returned.
On [**12-11**], he was noted to be C. diff positive and was started
on Flagyl.  His wound was packed with wet-to-dry dressing
changes on a daily basis and slowly improved.  Also of note,
the patient was thought to have an infiltrate on chest x-ray
and was started empirically on Levofloxacin for a 14-day
course.

Given the fact that the patient was thought to be doing well,
afebrile and tolerating a regular diet, on [**2131-12-17**], he was
discharged to rehab in stable condition on the following
medications.
