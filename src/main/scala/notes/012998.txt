      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    FINAL
SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

ECHO [**2197-7-25**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-12-16**],
there is no significant change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 805**] is an 64yo male with PMH significant for HTN and
DM2 who presents with rhabdomyolysis.

1)Rhabdomyolysis: Patient is admitted with classic presentation
of rhabdomyolysis which includes myalgias, red to brown urine
due to myoglobinuria, and elevated serum muscle enzymes. The
differential diagnosis for rhabdomyolysis includes the
following: trauma, crush injuries, coma, immobilization, extreme
exertion, seizures, extreme heat, malignant hyperthermia,
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, myopathy, alcoholism,
drugs/toxins (statins, colchicine), viral infections, and
endocrinopathies (DKA, non-ketotic hyperglycemia,
hypothyroidism). The most likely cause in this patient is
immobilization given history of lying in bed for the past 3
days. Per his pharmacy, he has not recently been on a statin. He
received 1L NS and sodium bicarbonate infusion in the ED. TSH
and cortisol was normal. He also had a normal urine and serum
tox screen. Upon transfer to the MICU he was continued on D5W +
150mEQ HCO3. His CK trended down as he received IVFs.  He
received 8 L NS with sodium bicarb in the MICU. CK started
trending down and he was transferred to floor, continued
hydration, with continued trending down of CK.  On [**7-24**] CK
1381->CK 1067->647 on [**7-26**].  IVF d/c with increasing PO and
continued improving CK.

Pneumonia: Patient with infiltrate on CXR, finished 7 day course
of levaquin.

2)Acute renal failure: Patient presents with elevated creatinine
of 2.7 likely [**1-21**] rhabdomyolysis. Baseline Cr is 1.0. His
creatinine returned to baseline after IVFs.

3)GPC bacteremia: Spiked to 101.8. BCx [**12-24**] growing GPCs.
Possible contamination however also with fevers. Started on
vancomycin in the ICU. Concern for possible infectious (HIV,
CMV) causes of rhabdomyolysis. HIV test negative. Given concern
of
