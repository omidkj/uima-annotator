Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2136-10-29**] and taken to the Operating Room for T11-L4 interbody
fusion through a thoracotomy. Please refer to the dictated
operative note for further details. The surgery was without
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a
stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative
DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were given per standard
protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA and the
Chronic Pain Service was consulted for mangagment of her large
pain medication requirements. On HD#4 ([**2136-11-1**]) she returned
to the operating room for a scheduled T3-L3 posterior fusion as
part of a staged 2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated
operative note for further details. The second surgery was also
without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU
in a stable condition. Postoperative HCT was low and she was
transfused multiple units PRBCs. A bupivicaine epidural pain
catheter placed at the time of the posterior surgery remained in
place until postop day one. She developed an ileus and was kept
NPO until bowel function returned then diet was advanced as
tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication
when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#3 from the
second procedure. She was fitted with a TLSO brace for
amnbulation. Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB
to ambulate. Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. On the

signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular
diet.
