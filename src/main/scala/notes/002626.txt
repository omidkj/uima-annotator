PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Doppler parameters are most
consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. LVEF = 50%.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-CPB: On infusion of Phenylephrine and temporary A-pacing.
LV function remains intact LVEF 60%. RV function remains normal.
Trace aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, mild
tricuspic regurgitation. Aortic contour remains normal post
decannulation.
