Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Aortic valvuloplasty


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old woman with history of aortic
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0 cm2 in [**12-19**]), CHF (diastolic- EF
60%), AF on coumadin, COPD, and RA/SLE who presented to
cardiology clinic today with progressive SOB. Patient saw her
outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the morning of admission for
follow up of her chronic conditions. She describes increased
palpitations and shortness of breath in the past several weeks.
She denies associated chest pain but does note some dizziness on
moving from lying to sitting or sitting to standing. Notes
palpitations are less severe than those she has had with AF in
the past. Denies syncope and pre-syncope.
.
Daughter notes that the patient has more chronically been
suffering from SOB, worsening over the 6 month to one year. She
was hospitalized in [**2147-12-12**] and went to rehab, at which time
she was put on home oxygen - 3L - and spiriva and advair were
added to regimen. Her daughter and home health aide note that
she has had new SOB with small movements- moving from bed to her
wheelchair or moving from her chair to the comode. As recently
as a year and a half ago they report she was able to walk up a
few stairs. Patient and daughter deny increase in lower leg
edema, but report worsened orthopnea (sleeps in hospital bed at
about 45 degrees with 2-3 pillows) and PND. Report chronic
cough, productive of white phlegm. No hemoptysis. Deny fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
MI, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at
the time of surgery, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. She does note chronic myalgias and joint pains. All
of the other review of systems were negative.

[**2148-8-1**] INR (PT) 1.8

Urine Legionella negative.
[**8-3**] Blood cultures = No growth x2
[**8-2**] Urine culture- GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA. 10,000-100,000
ORGANISMS/ML. Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha
streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp.
[**7-30**] Urine culture- No growth.
.
[**7-29**] EKG - Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation with
controlled ventricular response. T wave abnormalities. Since the
previous tracing of [**2148-1-5**] the rate has decreased.
.
[**7-31**] EKG - Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave change. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2148-7-29**] no diagnostic interim change.
.
[**7-29**] CXR - Comparison made with a radiograph dated [**2146-10-5**]. Mild

cardiomegaly, a diaphragmatic hernia containing small bowel and
a moderate thoracic spine kyphosis are stable findings. Left
lower lobe atelectasis and a small left lower lobe effusion have
progressed slightly since the previous radiograph. There is no
evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
[**7-30**] LENI (Left)- No evidence of DVT of the left lower
extremity.
.
[**7-30**] Echo - The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8 square cm). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2148-8-1**] Cardiac Cath (prelim): 1. Coronary angiography in this
right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent
disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA. 2. Resting hemodynamics
revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with
RVEDP 16 mmHg and LVEDP 30 mmHg. There was mild pulmonary
arterial hypertension with PASP 42 mmHg. The cardiac index was
preserved at 2.0 L/min/m2. The systemic [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] resistance was
mildly elevated at 1667 dyn-sec/cm5 with normal pulmonary
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] resistance. There was systemic arterial normotension.
3. At baseline, there was a 45 mmHg gradient across the aortic
valve with a calculated valve area of 0.61 cm2. Following three
inflations of a 20 mm Tyshak baloon during rapid right
ventricular pacing, the mean pressure gradient diminished to 25
mmHg with a calculated aortic
