HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 77-year-old female with
end-stage renal disease secondary to glomerulonephritis who
presented to the [**Hospital6 256**] for a
cadaveric renal transplant on [**2140-11-30**].  Surgery went
without any technical complications.  The patient was
extubated in the PACU.  However, it was noted that she was
slightly hypotensive and she was tachycardiac with an
irregular rhythm.  She required at that point IV Lopressor
for rate control.  She was transferred to the ICU for close
monitoring as well as for rate control and for pressure
support.  She was originally placed on an Amiodarone drip as
well as a Neo drip.  These were eventually weaned.  The
patient did require cardioversion and the patient has
remained in normal sinus rhythm since.  She was placed on a
p.o. regimen of Amiodarone which was adjusted by Cardiology.
The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction.

Her postoperative course was noted for delayed graft
function.  She required three episodes of hemodialysis as
well as one ultrafiltration.  Her urine output still
continues to be minimal.  Her creatinine at baseline was 5.9.
By the time of discharge, it had decreased to 3.6.  Her urine
output is slowly improving.

Postoperatively, she was placed on the usual Solu-Medrol
taper.  She was placed on CellCept 1,000 mg p.o. b.i.d. which
was eventually weaned to 500 p.o. b.i.d.  She received a
total of four doses of ATG and was started on Tacrolimus on
postoperative day number four and was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day number seven.  Her diet was
advanced as tolerated.  Physical Therapy consulted on the
patient.  She continued, however, to have delayed graft
function.  It was felt best that the patient be discharged to
a rehabilitation center.

The patient is to continue with her regular dialysis schedule
at the rehabilitation center as she was started on her
preoperative Coumadin dose as well as Amiodarone 200 p.o.
q.d.  She is to continue this and to be carefully monitored
and followed up with her personal cardiologist.  Her
laboratories will be redrawn at the rehabilitation center.

Of note, the patient underwent two renal ultrasounds of the
transplanted kidney.  The first one was on postoperative day
number one which showed just a small fluid collection around
the kidney, otherwise, the duplex ultrasound was normal.  She
had a follow-up duplex ultrasound on postoperative day number
nine which indicated resolved fluid collection and indices
around 0.7.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  To rehabilitation center.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post cadaveric renal transplant for end-stage
renal disease secondary to glomerulonephritis on [**2140-11-30**].
2.  Delayed graft function.
3.  Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
4.  Postoperative hypotension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Bactrim SS one tablet p.o. q.d.
2.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.

4.  Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. six hours p.r.n.

sleep.
6.  Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. eight hours.

9.  Valcyte 450 mg p.o. q.o.d.
10. Nystatin swish and swallow.
11. Sevelamer 1,600 mg p.o. t.i.d.
12. Levothyroxine sodium 175 micrograms p.o. q.d.
13. Haloperidol 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
14. Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d.
15. Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.d.  This is to be adjusted based on
daily INR.
16. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. This is to be adjusted by the
patient's cardiologist.
17. Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., hold for systolic blood
pressures less than 100 or heart rates less than 60.
18. CellCept [**Pager number **] mg p.o. b.i.d.
19. Zofran 4 mg IV q. eight hours p.r.n. nausea.
20. Of note, the patient is additionally on Tacrolimus.  Her
current dose is being held until her Tacrolimus level is
obtained and it will be adjusted accordingly.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15473**]
at the Transplant Center, phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] on
[**2140-12-13**] at 9:10 a.m.  She is additionally to
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2140-12-20**] at 3:40
p.m. as well as with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2140-12-26**] at 12:00
p.m.  She is to be discharged to the rehabilitation center
where she is to receive daily laboratories which should
include a CBC, Chem-10, PT/PTT/INR as well as a daily
tacrolimus level which should be drawn before the tacrolimus
a.m. dose is given.  She is to follow-up with her personal
cardiologist to wean her off Amiodarone and to adjust her
anticoagulation.  She is to continue with her scheduled
dialysis on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at the
rehabilitation center until her delayed graft function has
resolved.  Please contact Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
the Transplant Center at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] with any further
