Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2137-1-30**] 8:57 AM

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-26**], the IJ catheter
has been
removed. There is still substantial enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette in this patient who has undergone prior CABG
procedure. The superior mediastinal contents appear to be within
normal limits. There may be minimal residual indistinctness of
pulmonary markings consistent with mild elevation of pulmonary
venous pressure. Basilar atelectasis has substantially improved,
and there are several streaks of atelectasis in the left mid
zone. Mild blunting of the costophrenic angles are again noted.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area ~0.9cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
84year old man found to have new onset atrial fibrillation on
routine exam. Admitted to [**Hospital6 3105**] for workup,
echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to evaluate surgical candidacy. After the
ussual surgical workup including dental and carotid evaluation
as well as treatment for LE cellulitis the patient was brought
to the operating room for redo sternotomy and aortic valve
replacement. Please see operative report for details. He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit in
stable condition. He was hemodynamically stable in the early
post-op period. He woke from anesthesia neurologically intact
was weaned from the ventilator and extubated on the day of
surgery. All tubes lines and drains were removed per cardiac
surgery protocol. He remained hemodynamically stable but was
noted to have some delerium and remained in the ICU for that
reason. By POD4 he had cleared and was trnasferred to the
cardiac stepdown floor for continued care and recovery. Physical
therapy was consulted to assist with activities of daily living,
strength and endurance. He conti
