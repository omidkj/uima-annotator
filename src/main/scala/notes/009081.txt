Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Y tracheal stent placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 yo transfer from St.vincents for
tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia, now s/p IP stenting. The
patient originally presented to an OSH on [**2171-12-19**] for shortness
of breath. He was diagnosed with a CHF exacerbation/new a fib.
During the OSH course, he was found unresposive with a decreased
O2 saturation (unknown exact measurement). He was intubated at
that time. The patient failed extubation and was re-intubated,
bronchoscoped and found to have tracheomalacia. He was most
recently re-intubated on [**2172-1-6**]. Blood and sputum cultures
were growing MRSA; vancomycin was started on [**2172-1-2**]. A TTE/TEE
were negative for vegetations. Of note, while at the OSH he did
have an episode of coffee ground emesis for which an EGD was
performed and showed erosion in the antrum, duodenum and
stomach. From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient was felt
to be in CHF and had new onset a fib. He was aggressively
diuresed. He was initally started on a cardizem drip for rate
control and was transitioned to PO cardizem with HR's in the
50's-60's. Finally, he was treated with prednisone and
nebulizers for COPD exacerbation.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2172-1-10**] for IP evaluation. A
bronchoscopy was performed on [**2172-1-11**] which showed significant
tracheobronchial malacia involving the distal trachea, right and
left main stem bronchus. It was decided that he needed a Y stent
to facilitate extubation. He went to the OR on [**2172-1-13**] and had
the Y stent placed. Sputum cultures from [**2172-1-11**] grew sparse
staph aureus and rare gram negative rods.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
Vitals - BP 133/75, HR 91, RR 16, O2 100%
Vent - AC 450x14, PEEP 10, FIO2 100%
General - obese male, intubated and sedated
HEENT - PERRL
Neck - obsese, unable to appreciate JVP given size of neck
CV - RRR
Lungs - diffuse rhonci
Abdomen - obese, non-tender, non-distended
Ext - 1+ pitting edema bilaterally


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2171-12-23**] OSH ECHO - LV normal, EF 50-55%, RV normal, RV systolic
function normal, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated, borderline RA enlargement,
MV normal, TV normal, RV systolic pressure 40-50mmHg, trace
aortic regurg, tracepulm regurg, no pericardial effusion.
[**2172-1-11**] CXR - Likely mild-to-moderate fluid overload and
retrocardiac air space opacity, atelectasis versus developing
pneumonia. Abnormal course of right subclavian central venous
catheter as described. PA and lateral films could further
assess. Repositioning may be necessary.
[**2172-1-12**] CXR - Indwelling devices are unchanged in position.
Appearance of the chest is without change from a recent study
except for slight improved aeration in left retrocardiac region.
Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, a 1-cm diameter
radiopaque density is identified overlying the region of the
stomach. Although potentially due to a structure external to the
patient, a small aspirated tooth or other foreign body should
also be considered. Attention to this area on repeat radiograph
following removal of external objects would be helpful in this
regard if warranted clinically
.
Micro:
[**2172-1-11**] Blood - pending
[**2172-1-11**] Sputum - 2+ GPC, 2+ GNR; culture growing spare staph
aureus and rare GNR


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with obesity, DM, CAD,
Hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH because of
difficulty weaning from ventilator support after developing MRSA
pneumonia. Patient was found to have tracheobroncheomalacia,
ultimately requiring tracheostomy. The following issues were
addressed:
.
# TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA/RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Patient was
intubated on 3 occasions at OSH; most recently re-intubated on
[**2172-1-6**]. A bronchoscopy revealed tracheobronchomalacia and he
had a Y stent placed in the OR on [**2172-1-13**]. The Y stent did not
adequately address his tracheobroncomalacia; he had increased
secretions and dropped his lung daily so the Y stent was
removed. He subsequently received a tracheostomy tube on
[**2172-1-17**]. Plan is for patient to be slowly weaned off ventilator
support.  Patient is also receiving active diuresis with Lasix.
Please continue to assess his volume status and continue
diuresis until patient is euvolemic and diuresis is tolerated.

# GNR PNEUMONIA - Mr. [**Known lastname 77222**] sputum grew citrobacter and
acinetobacter. He was started on a 7-day course of Meropenem, to
be completed on [**2172-1-24**]. Patient responded well to this
antibiotic therapy.
.
# VAP MRSA PNEUMONIA - has been on vancomycin for MRSA PNA since
[**2172-1-2**] (started at OSH) due to fever and secretions.  The
patient completed a 14 day course of vancomycin on [**2172-1-16**].
.
# HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA: The patient's platelets
dropped early in his admission and he was found to be HIT +.  He
was started on an argatroban drip, and oral Warfarin was started
on [**2172-1-19**], to which he will be transitioned. Patient is to
continue Argatroban until he is therapeutic on Coumadin (INR
[**3-2**]) for 48 hours. Please note that Argatroban falsely elevates
INR. When his INR on Argatroban is between [**5-3**], Argatroban
should be held for 4 hours and an INR should be checked; this
INR should be between 2 and 3 for 48 hours before Argatroban can
be discontinued. PATIENT IS TO AVOID ALL HEPARIN PRODUCTS. He
will need to be anticoagulated with Coumadin for 6 months.
PLEASE AVOID ALL HEPARIN PRODUCTS. He will need to be
anticoagulated [**Last Name (un) **] Coumadin for a total of 6 months.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - currently rate controlled on metoprolol
25 TID.  Please titrate as needed. Also receiving Warfarin as
per above.
.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - continue statin
.
# AGITATION - The patient has required intermittent haldol and
ativan for agitiation and pulling at lines while inpatient.
.
# DM - Patient was maintained on insulin sliding scale
.
# NUTRITION: PEG tube was placed and patient was started on tube
feeds for nutrition.
.
# PICC - Patient had PICC placed in R arm on [**2172-1-20**] for
antibiotics and Argatroban. Please do NOT USE HEPARIN for
flushes. PICC should be discontinued once antibiotics regimen
and Argatroban regimen is complete.
