EGD [**2153-11-11**]:
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Ulcer in the pylorus
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Chest x-ray [**2153-11-10**]:
FINDINGS: AP semi-erect portable views of the chest are
obtained. An
enterogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
diaphragm, distal
aspect not included on the image. There may be minimal pulmonary
vascular
congestion. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. No definite focal
consolidation
is seen, although minimal aspiration would be difficult to
exclude. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are
stable.


Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
78-yo M with afib on coumadin, h/o multiple CVAs,
steroid-dependent asthma initially admitted to MICU for melena
in the setting of INR = 4.7.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:

# GI Bleed: The patient's initial HCT was 27.1 (last known Hct
41 in [**2152**]). In the ED, NG lavage was negative; rectal exam
demonstrated melanotic stool.  He received 2 units of PRBCs &
his INR was reversed with FFP & vitamin K (initial INR was 4.7).
  GI evaluated the patient & an EGD was performed on [**11-11**] which
revealed a small non-bleeding gastric ulcer.  Over the course of
his hospitalization, the patient received a total of 3 units of
pRBCs.  His HCT at discharge was 29.7; his stools were of normal
color with no further melena.  It is possible that the ulcer was
the cause for the GI bleed, vs. another upper GI pathology.  The
patient will follow-up with GI as an outpatient; he will likely
have a repeat EGD and/or colonoscopy.

# H. Pylori Infection: As part of his GI work-up, the patient's
blood was sent for H. Pylori serologies, which resulted
positive.  As such, he was started on amoxicillin,
clarithromycin, & continued on his PPI.  He was instructed to
continue the antibiotics for a total of 2 weeks; he will be
continued on a PPI from this point forward.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# Atrial Fib with RVR:  The patient's initial heart rate was in
the 120s.  Coumadin was held in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR.  The patient takes verapamil as an
outpatient for rate control, which was held .  In the MICU, he
developed asymptomatic tachycardia, so he was started on
diltiazem.  Mr. [**Known lastname 14972**] did not tolerate diltiazem due to nausea,
so his verapamil was restarted on the floor.  Given his CHADS2
score of 4 & history of prior CVA, he was initially started on a
heparin drip (upon approval from GI).  The patient, however,
wished to return home & was not interested in lovenox
injections.  It was not thought that he required a bridge to
coumadin; he was discharged on 3 mg coumadin QD with a plan to
have his PCP follow his INR closely.

# Asthma: The patient's lung exam revealed diffuse wheeze.  He
was continued on his home MDI & steroids. His steroid dose was
increased from 10 mg to 20 mg given that he had ongoing wheeze &
briefly required oxygen.  He will follow-up with his
pulmonologist upon discharge.  In addition to his calcium &
vitamin D prophylaxis, he may also need antibiotic prophylaxis
in the setting of long-term antibiotics.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

# INR Monitoring: Given that the patient came in with a
supratherapeutic INR, it will be important for his INR &
coumadin dosing to be followed closely.  He was discharged with
instructions to check his INR several times before his follow-up
appointment with his primary care doctor.

# Follow Up: The patient will follow up with his PCP,
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **], & pulmonology.  Please refer to discharge
worksheet section for appointments.

# Code Status: Full code.
