IMAGING STUDIES:

CXR [**2173-7-22**]:
FINDINGS: Patchy opacity in the right upper lung could reflect a
developing pneumonia in the superior segment of the right lower
lobe. Second opacity in the lung base over the spine on the
lateral could reflect a second focus in the left lower lobe.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is
normal in size. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.

IMPRESSION: Early developing pneumonia in the superior segment
of the right lower lobe. Possible additional site in the left
lower lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 75064**] is a 67 year old woman who presented with community
acquired pneumonia to her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was initially admitted to the
MICU because of blood pressures in the 90s systolic which
responded well to IV fluids, monitored overnight, transferred to
the floor where she continued to improve.

#. Community Acquired Pneumonia:
The patient reports 4 days of malaise and cough as an
outpatient, and reports her granddaughter was also having
similar symptoms.  She was seen by her PCP who found her to be
febrile to 101 with PO2 89-92%RA and was sent to the ED.  She
was found to be 95% on triage but was borderline hypotensive,
responsive to IV fluids, and was admitted to the MICU for the
borderline hypotension and transient hypoxia prior to admission.
 CXR showed possible RLL pneumonia.  She was empirically started
on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin and cultures were sent.  In the
MICU, she was afebrile and maintained PO2 in the mid to high
90's on 2L NC and was switched to po Levofloxacin prior to
transfer to the floor.  Urine Legionella returned negative.
Ambulatory O2 sat 95% on discharge.  Patient will continue for 4
more days of levofloxacin after discharge for a total antibiotic
course of 7 days.

#. Hypotension:
The patient was borderline hypotensive in the ED, responsive to
fluids.  She maintained her BP in the low 90's and received 2L
NS boluses in the MICU with BP maintaining in the 110's
subsequently.  Her home lisinopril was held during
hospitalization but may be restarted the day after discharge.

#. Emesis:
Patient with one episode of emesis prior to admission, possibly
secondary to nausea from her pneumonia, no evidence of acute GI
illness.  The patient had no further episodes of emesis

#. Anemia:
The patient has a baseline hct of 35-37.  On admission, her hct
was 38 and trended to 35 following boluses of NS.  She was given
addition boluses of NS in the MICU with subsequent trend of hct
to 32.8 but no sign of bleeding and low suspicion for hemolysis.

# HTN:
As described above, the patient received NS boluses for
borderline hypotension and her home Lisinopril was held during
this admissioin.

# DM:
The patient's home Janumet was held on initial admission and she
was covered with SSI.

# Depression:
Continued home dose of fluoxetine.

# Detrusor Overactivity:  Oxybutinin extended release not on
formulary so switched to oxybutinin 2.5mg PO BID.

# Code: Full (discussed with patient)
