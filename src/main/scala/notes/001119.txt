Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**7-1**] to cardiology and underwent cath. Was given large
loading dose of plavix on [**6-30**] with additional dose on [**7-1**]. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] elected to wait several days to let the plavix wear off
prior to cabg. Carotid US performed in the interim showed
significant left carotid dz. He underwent cabg x3 on [**7-5**] and
was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on titrated
propofol and phenylephrine drips. Extubated successfully that
evening and remained on a phenylephrine drip on POD #1 in SR
with a BBB. Weaned off neo on POD #2 and chest tubes were
removed. He was transferred to the floor to begin increasing his
activity level. Beta blockade and gentle diuresis were started.
Had rapid AFib that evening and was transfused one unit PRBCs.
Amiodarone was started and he converted to SR.

Pacing wires removed on POD #4 and he was encouraged to increase
his pulm. toilet and ambulation. He developed left forearm
phlebitis with a pustule on POD #5 and was started on abx and
seen by vascular. It was also noted he had some sacral
breakdown(HD #11). Ultrasound of his left arm revealed no fluid
collection, he has remained stable hemodynamically, and he is
ready to be discharged home today.
