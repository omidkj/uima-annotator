History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28412**] is a 56 year old woman with history of diabetes,
hypothyroidism, and remote history of Hodgkin's disease who
presented for the evaluation of fever and rash. Last Wednesday
(six days prior to admission, she noticed a rash on her face.
She went with her husband to his doctor's appointment, and he
took a urine sample and diagnosed her with the flu. The rash
started on her face and then spread over her entire body,
including extremities, although she denies involvement of the
hands and soles. It is not painful and not itchy. She then
developed chills and fevers to 101F, along with "excruciating"
intermittent headaches, located over her right eye, for which
she was prescribed Vicodin with good effect on both her
headaches and ability to sleep. She also reports muscle and
joint aches, as well as diffuse body weakness. She was not
improving, and the day prior to admission, her daughter took her
to an OSH (but she vomited in the car on the way to the hospital
and traveled the rest of the way via ambulance), where she had
an elevated white count, was diagnosed with a UTI, given IVF,
ciprofloxacin and compazine, and sent home. She denies sick
contacts, genital ulcers or lesions, travel outside of the
country, prolonged exposure in the [**Doctor Last Name 6641**] (although she does have
to walk in high grass to and from the mailbox), tick or mosquito
bites, pets, unusual foods, and raw seafood. She denies new
medications preceding the rash, and she denies use of new
deodorants or lotions. Per her family (daughter), she seemed to
have trouble concentrating, but was not particularly altered in
cognition. Mental status worsened with fevers/rigors but
improved after Tylenol. She reports being up to date on all her
vaccines. Of note, her husband recently had quadruple bypass
surgery two weeks ago at [**Hospital1 18**] and is currently recovering; she
reports increased stress and minimal sleep since the operation.

.
In the ED, her vitals were T99.6F, HR 109, BP 148/81, RR 24, Sat
100%2LNC. She was given IVF, diphenhydramine without improvement
in the rash. She was transferred to the floor.

Past Medical History:
1)Type 2 Diabetes
2)Hypercholesterolemia
3)s/p Hodgkin's lymphoma, rx splenectomy/radiation 20 years ago

and drugs. Has not been sexually active with husband in several

CXR: Mild edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. There is

presumed partially calcified mass lesion likely within the
anterior
mediastinum of indeterminate etiology. Diagnostic considerations
include prior granulomatous disease or possibly treated
lymphoma. A calcified mass possibly from thyroid origin is also
in the differential diagnosis. This lesion does not likely
represent an acute finding. If indicated, consider non-urgent
outpatient chest CT for further characterization.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 28412**] is a 56 year old woman with remote history of
Hodgkin's disease, and history of diabetes, presenting with
fever, intermittent headache, malaise, fatigue,
arthralgias/myalgias, mild transaminitis, and diffuse macular
blanching rash.
.
#. Fever and rash. Dermatology and ID were consulted.
Doxycycline initially added to cover rickettsial/atypical
infections, then stopped.  Initially there was concern for
Sweet's; however, pathology from skin biopsy was not consistent
with this.  Pathology prelim with edema and perivascular
neutrophilic infiltrate (similar to urticaria, but not
consistent with clinical picture).  No evidence of leukemic
infiltrate.  Rheumatology was consulted following biopsy results
(as could be consistent with Still's); felt to be non-rheum in
nature.  Differential included post viral hypersensitivity
reaction, drug reaction, less likely viral exanthem.  The
following serologies and additional studies were obtained during
her admission:  Parvovirus IgG/IgM negative, Mycoplasma IgG
pos/IgM neg, RPR neg, Lyme neg, monospot neg, resp viral antigen
neg, Rubella and Rubeola IgG pos, ESR 115, RF 20, [**Doctor First Name **] neg.
Blood and urine cultures negative.
Her rash improved significantly (in intensity and distribution)
over the course of her admission without any intervention.  At
discharge she had also been afebrile x >48hours.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  On [**6-5**]
was noted to be tachycardic to 160s+ on routine vitals, ECG with
?MAT.  Back into sinus with IV lopressor and fever control.  On
[**6-6**] again persistently tachycardic to 140s with rhythm more
consistent with atrial fibrillation, very difficult to rate
control.  Briefly transferred to MICU where received diltiazem
gtt.  Normotensive during episodes but did drop briefly into
upper 80s with receiving dilt.  Eventually titrated up to
diltiazem 360 daily plus metoprolol 150 daily; with this regimen
she has been in and out of Afib with rates generally in  90s,
very briefly increasing into 120's.  Heparin gtt as bridge to
coumadin started.  Cardiology was consulted and she will have
followup with them as an outpaient.  INRs will be checked by her
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] control can further be adjusted by her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
reason for Afib was unclear.  She had repeat echo without
significant change (normal LV function, no evidence of RV
strain, normal atrial size).  No underlying pulmonary disease,
though did have new pulmonary edema on CXR (despite normal LV
function on echo) which may have triggered the arrhythmia.  TSH
normal.
.
#. Hypoxia/pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema and effusions on
chest xray (?cardiogenic vs. noncardiogenic/inflammatory
source).  This initially worsened during admission with new O2
requirement; with diuresis this improved and she was not
requiring O2 at discharge.  Unclear why she developed pulmonary
edema as above.  BNP was elevated at 3855.
.
#. Transaminitis. Likely related to above viral/hypersensitivity
process. Transaminases peaked at admission and subsequently
declined.  However, alk phos continued to rise through her
discharge (353 at discharge) with elevated GGT as well.  RUQ
ultrasound without significant gallbladder/liver findings.  LFTs
will be followed by her PCP following discharge.
.
# Anemia. Hct slowly trended down since admission. Fe studies
c/w inflammation. No evidence of active bleeding.  She should
have repeat CBC as an outpatient.
.
# Thrombocytosis. Most likely is reactive given significant
inflammtion/acute illness. ASA was continued.
.
# Leukocytosis. Unclear as to etiology.  Stable in 13-15K range.
 Neutrophilia without bandemia.
.
#. Diabetes. Held PO meds and a
