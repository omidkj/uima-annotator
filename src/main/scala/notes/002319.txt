Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
Paralysis, epidural hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC
line)
Endotracheal Intubation
Blood Transfusion
Arterial Line


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year old man with a history of anxiety,
polysubstance abuse (hepatitis B and C), peripheral vascular
disease, HTN, COPD who presented with 3-4 days of increasing
lower extremity weakness.  Unfortunately, he is currently
intubated/sedated and cannot provide a history. Per review of
nursing home records and emergency department records, he noted
decreased sensation in his lower extremities, starting on the
left.  This was accompanied by increasing weakness.  These
symptoms occured in the setting of his girlfriend moving a
pillow for him 3-4 days ago.  Apparently denied trauma.  He was
initially seen at an OSH where he had an L-spine MRI that showed
an acute to subacute fx at L1-L2.

In the ED, initial vs were: 97.4  HR 111  100/63  RR 20  94% on
6 L.  He was intubated for an MRI.  In the MRI, he became
hypotensive with SBP to 80-90s.  He was started on levophed and
was given vancomycin and zosyn.  For sedation he was given
versed 5 mg IV and vecuronium 8 mg for MRI and was started on
versed/fent drips.  MRI revealed a compression fx at T6-7 with
an epidural collection likely hematoma.  Per radiology read,
there is suggestion of mass effect on cord. Per neurosurgery
review of films, neurosurgery feels that there is in fact no
mass effect.  Neurosurgery attending was contact[**Name (NI) **] by both the
neurology and [**Name (NI) **]. It was felt that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would not
benefit from an immediate surgical intervention and would best
be served on the medical service.  Of note a RIJ was placed in
the ED prior to transfer to the floor.
.
On the floor, he is intubated and sedated.  He grimaces to pain
but does not respond to simple commands.

Past Medical History:
- Anxiety,
- Hep B and C
- SAH
- PVD
- HTN
- COPD on [**4-23**] L O2 at home
- Recent Pneumonia

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been at [**Hospital 5503**] Rehab Hospital, recently
admitted OSH w/ discharge diagnosis of COPD exacerbation on IV
vancomycin and solumedrol.
-H/O IVDU, states he has not used in years.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging
.
[**2139-4-27**] MRI Spine
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild-to-moderate compression fractures of T5 through T7 with
a
heterogeneously enhancing epidural collection, concerning for
ostemyelitis
with evolving epidural abscess. However, the lack of extensive
enhancement
including the disc space is unusual for pyogenic infection and
there may be a combination of chronic neurogenic
spondyloarthropathy with hematoma/phlegmon and superimposed
infection. TB could have this appearance and should be
correlated with clinical and laboratory findings. There is
resultant severe encroachment on the spinal canal anteriorly
with cord deformity and abnormal cord signal.
2. Findings concerning for a developing secondary infection at
C5-6 without cord compression. While the endplate and disc edema
could be post-traumatic, the extent of epidural enhancement
would be very unusal in the setting of trauma.
3. Mild compression fractures of L1 and L2 without cord or cauda
equina
compression.
4. Additional degenerative changes as detailed.
5. Pulmonary findings concerning for pleural and/or parenchymal
disease for which chest CT has been recommended and please see
that report for further details.
.
[**2139-4-28**] CT Chest

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe bilateral, occlusive bronchial mucoid impaction.
2. No appreciable pleural effusion, loculated or otherwise.
Right basal
atelectasis is moderate.
3. Diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
4. Possible aspiration effect, right middle lobe and right lower
lobes
5. Diffuse debris is noted within the tracheobronchial tree.
Dense secretions are noted in the right lower lobe and left
lower lobe bronchi.
6. Vertebral body wedge compressions T5, T7 , T8, L1 with
suggestion of lytic lesions in at least in T8, possible
paraspinal hematoma, tumor, and/or marrow, better described on
same day CT and MR.5.
7. 7 x 9 mm nodule, left upper lobe, could be malignant.
.
[**2139-4-28**] Lower Extremity Doppler
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the lower extremities
bilaterally.
.
[**2139-4-28**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal/small. Left ventricular systolic function appears grossly
preserved. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
free wall motion appears borderline preserved in suboptimal
views. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a very small pericardial effusion. No valvular
regurgitation is identified in suboptimal views.
.
[**2139-4-28**] CT Spine
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple thoracolumbar compression fractures as described
above.
2. Mild multilevel degenerative disease with grade 1
retrolisthesis of L5 on S1, posterior disc bulge with mild
central canal narrowing.
3. At T7 level, there is paravertebral soft tissue thickening
which appears to be subpleural in location
.
[**2139-4-30**] MRI SPine
IMPRESSION:
1. Continued abnormal signal in the cervical spine at C6-7
level, but
significant decrease in epidural collection at this level.
2. Multiple T5-7 compression fractures are again seen, with
minimal decrease in epidural collection at this level, but
continued abnormal cord signal thought due to mass effect.
For more detailed description of degenerative changes at other
levels, please refer to previous extensive report from three
days prior
