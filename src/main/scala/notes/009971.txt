HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**10-9**] for elective ascending
thoracic aneurysm repair.  The patient was taken to the
operating room where she was prepped and draped after being
placed under general anesthesia, however, once the
transesophageal echo probe was in place, it was noted that
the patient had an aneurysm of the descending aorta of
approximately 6 cm in size with a possibility of a contained
rupture dissection flap adjacent to the left subclavian
artery that extended at least 4 cm distally.  The case was
cancelled because of the concern for a potential dissection
extending too far proximal for repair.  The case was aborted
and the patient was transferred to the SICU and subsequently
to the floor.  She was scheduled for an MR angiogram of the
aorta and that was performed on the 25th with the following
findings.  She had a large descending aortic aneurysm 7.6 cm
in maximal diameter extending to the left hemidiaphragm as
well as a short type II aortic dissection.  She was continued
on her anti-hypertensive regimen and scheduled for an
elective repair on Monday of the following week. She was
subsequently in stable condition with blood pressure in the
