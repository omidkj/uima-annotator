History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 58 year old male transferred from [**Hospital3 **]. Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**2152-4-13**] with
symptoms of small bowel obstruction. He was taken to the OR the
same day of presentation for lysis of adhesions- no distinct
transition zone was found. Post operatively, patient remain
intubated with septic/ARDs like picture and on [**2152-4-21**]
began to leak bowel contents from midline wound. Patient was
taken back for a second operation [**2152-4-21**] for repair of a
small bowel perforation. A second episode of leakage from wound
occurred on [**2152-4-28**]. Patient taken to the OR the third
time the dame day for trach placement, repair of the second
perforation (no resection performed in either case), and  end
ileostomy. Aproximately POD 4 from the third surgery, stool
again began leaking from the incision. Patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] per request of family and girlfriend and was on both
TPN and tube feeds at time of transfer. Patient had received
levo, zosyn and unasyn at [**Hospital3 **].

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit on
[**2152-5-4**]. Patient was continued on TPN, zosyn and levo. On HD 2,
perc drainage of L flank extravasation was performed and blood
pressure was continued to be supported with fluid boluses.
Antibiotics was was changed to meropenum, gent and fluc based on
clx results-pseudomonas grew from sputum cultures.  Patient
spiked and line was changed over wire. Tip was subsequently
positive and the line was resited. Patient was also started on
hydrocortisone for adrenal insuffciency. Infectious disease was
consulted and vanc was added. On HD 6, echo demonstrated normal
cardiac function, pateint started trach collar trials,
octreotide was started, physical therapy was started and patient
was evaluated for a passy muir valve. Also, RUQ US demonstrated
GB sludge and repeat CT demonstrated near complete resolution of
L fluid collection but persistent leakage of bowel contents in
the anterior abdominal wall. No vegatations were noted on a
repeat echo. NGT was discontinued on hospital day 8, steroid
wean was begun and urine output responded well to lasix. Patient
was transferred to the floor on hospital day 10, however, he
returned to the unit on [**5-20**] for tachycardia, likely due to
atrial fibrillation. He underwent another CT-guided drainage and
aspiration. His atrial fibrillation was eventually contolled and
he was transferred back to the floor on [**5-23**]. His fistula output
steadily decreased, but never entirely ceased. He continued to
work with physical therapy, and made excellent progress. His
bowel required manual disimpaction, but he eventually recovered
bowel movements. At the suggestion of ID, his meropenem and
gentamicin were discontinued on [**5-29**], and Zosyn was started
instead. He gradually tolerated clears for comfort. On [**5-30**], he
developed respiratory distress and was again transferred to the
SICU for tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
Workup for PE was negative. Gentamicin was re-started. A repeat
CT scan on [**6-2**] showed no new fluid collections. He was
transferred to the floor on [**6-3**]. He gradually improved. A mild
bump in his LFTs was attributed to his chronic TPN, and nutrient
levels were adjusted. Vanco and gent were discontinued on [**6-9**],
and his pain control was changed to a fentanyl patch and prn
morphine.The timing of his fistulogram was discussed at great
length, and it was decided the optimal time would be after his
discharge to rehab, to allow him time to gain his strength and
regain mobility in preparation for the fistulogram and resultant
operative assessment. He was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] acute care
rehab in stable condition on [**6-13**].
