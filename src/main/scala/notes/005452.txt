History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 85 yom with hx of A fib, CHF (Ef 35%), GERD, and
mechanical mitral valve replacement, chronically anticoagulated
on coumadin initially presented with 2-4 episodes of BRBPR
accompanied by abdominal cramping. He noted large amt of blood
in toilet bowl. He had several episodes of bloody bm at home and
he presented to ED. Deneid any symptoms of fatigue,
lightheadedness.
.
In the ED patient was hemodynamically stable. Initial Hct was
35.7. GI was consulted in the ED. An NG lavage was performed
with 250 cc NS with yellow bilious return. He was treated with
40 mg IV Protonix and started on bowel prep with 4 L of
Go-lytely. He was transferred to MICU. In the unit he underwent
tagged RBC scan which showed bleeding in LLQ, however angio was
negative. He received 3 units of PRBC and hct remained stable
thereafter. Angio sheaths pulled around 4pm on [**9-15**].
.
On transfer pt does not have any complaints. Denies any
chestpain, sob, lightheadedness. He has not had any large bloody
BMs for >1 day now. Per nursing only small (quater sized) amt of
blod when he passes gas few times today.

hct 26 -> 28 ->30.6 ([**9-15**] 7PM)
INR 1.9
Tagged RBC scan [**9-14**] - Gastrointestinal bleeding in left lower
quadrant
.
Angio [**9-14**] - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of GI bleeding in the SMA or [**Female First Name (un) 899**] territory.
2. Spasm versus occluded branch of the left colic artery.
3. No signs of angiodysplasia or neovascularity.
4. Right transfemoral approach 5-French vascular sheath left in
place due to patient's anticoagulated status . This is left to
continuous flush.
.
Tagged RBC scan [**9-16**] - INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous
injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m,
blood flow and delayed images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were
obtained.  A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show prompt flow of tracer through the aorta
and iliac
arteries. Delayed blood pool images show no evidence of bleeding
within the GI tract. IMPRESSION: No visible source of GI bleed.

.
Colonoscopy: Severe diverticulosis. No active bleeding.
EGD: normal mucosa, no active bleeding.
Virtual colonoscopy: no active bleeding.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yom with a. fib, chf (ef 35%), MVR, gerd and on
anticoagulation with coumadin at home admitted with BRBPR,
thought to be bleeding diverticuli in the setting of
anticoagulation.
.
#GI bleed: The patient had several episodes of bright red blood
per rectum during his admission, and although his Hct did drop
slightly, it remained stable at 28 and the patient was
asymptomatic. Initial tagged RBC scan with LLQ bleeding, however
angio was negative. He had more episodes of BRBPR after having a
negative angio, so he had a repeat tagged RBC scan that was
negative [**9-16**]. IR did not feel repeat angio was indicated given
the negative tagged red cell scan. Patient had no further
epsiodes of BRBPR after [**9-16**]. Therefore, GI did colonoscopy and
EGD and patient had subsequent virtual [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to poor
prep (unable to visualize the cecum) which were negative for
active bleeding but demonstrated severe diverticulosis. We
restarted heparin gtt secondary to MVR and afib, under very
tight control with goal PTT between 40-80 and began to re-bridge
to coumadin on [**9-17**].
After the colonoscopy, the patient tolerated advancement of his
diet well and will be discharged on [**Hospital1 **] protonix. He was advised
to follow a low-residue diet.  He received 1unit of pRBC's and
his Hct bumped appropriately over 30, where it remained stable
until discharge.
.
# NSVT - On [**9-17**], the patient experienced a 15 run of VT. His
electrolytes were normal, last echo [**11-29**] with EF 40%. The
patient was stable and entirely asymptomatic during this
episode. We continued to follow him on telemetry with no further
events. It is possible that the patient was dehydrated, and we
hung maintenance fluids of NS at 100cc/hr.
.
#MVR/ A. fib: Given mechanical valve and a.fib, pt at very high
risk for thromboemblism if remains off anticoagulation. Given
his stable hct we restarted low dose heparin (goal PTT 60-80)
without bolus. We restarted coumadin on [**9-17**] and he was sent
home with INR of 3.5 (goal 2.5-3.5).
.
#CHF: Stable, restarted Lasix at 20 mg po qday to be changed per
PCP as an outpatient.
.
#HTN: Stable and well controlled on Metoprolol.
