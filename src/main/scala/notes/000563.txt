History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 3460**] [**Known lastname 99511**] is a 61 y.o. female who was seen at [**Hospital1 2025**] for
hemorrhagic stroke hypertensive in etiology 2 weeks ago, was
subsequently discharged home and then presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital 3 days ago for dyspnea. She was doing well but had SBP
in 200's and was refusing most BP meds and only taking Lopressor
12.5 per OSH physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] last evening, she was found down by
nursing after falling off the bed.  She was awake but delirious
and was noted to have expressive aphasia. She dropped her sats
to
the 80's and was taken to CT for planned CTA chest and CT head.
She decompensated further in the scanner without getting either
scan, was taken to the ICU where she was intubated and then
brought back to the scanner. Per the OSH physician the CTA chest
was negative for PE.  A CT head was obtained which showed a 3cm
Right temporal SDH along the temporal fossa, a Left temporal
contusion, and right sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] and temporoparietal bone
fractures extending to the sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**].

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Neurosurgery for further
management.
Prior to arrival she continued to desaturate and required
sedation in travel.

EEG ([**2144-1-6**]) -
IMPRESSION: This EEG gives evidence for what appeared initially
to be a severe encephalopathy and later seemed to have some, at
least minimum improvement. There was some focality to it in that
there were right temporal epileptiform transients but also
bicentral suggesting a more diffuse abnormality with some focal
superimposed features. No sustained seizure discharges were
identified.

CXR ([**2144-1-6**]):
The ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip
passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating in the
stomach. Hemodialysis catheter tip is at the level of the
cavoatrial junction.
Since the prior study, there has been interval progression of
pulmonary edema, asymmetric, mostly involving right lung.
Bibasal areas of atelectasis have progressed as well. Evaluation
of the patient after diuresis is highly recommended. The right
lower lobe consolidation might reflect in fact a combination of
pulmonary edema as well as additional process such as aspiration
or infection.
Esophageal temperature probe is noted.

[**2144-1-6**] CT BRAIN
Overall stable appearance of traumatic injuries from the prior
study is
demonstrated. Right temporal subgaleal hematoma with underlying
temporal bone fracture possibly involving the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of
the sphenoid is again demonstrated. Underlying this is
extra-axial hemorrhage overlying the inferior right temporal
lobe, most likely epidural, given its anatomic
location. The mass effect from this collection is unchanged.
A contra coup injury to the left temporal lobe has resulted in
an
intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusion surrounded by edema, also
unchanged.  Subdural hemorrage tracking along the left tentorium
is more conspicuous than on the prior study.
No new hemorrhage, mass, or infarct is seen. There is stable
fluid
opacification of the bilateral sphenoidal sinuses and several
ethmoid air
cells.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of right temporal bone fracture with
underlying
extra-axial hematoma, most likely in the epidural space given
the location and mechanism. No marked mass effect.
2. Unchanged left temporal hemorrhagic contusion.
3. More conspicuous left subdural hematoma overlying the
temporal lobe and
tracking along tentorium.
4. No new hemorrhage.

CXR ([**2144-1-9**]):
There has been interval removal of the endotracheal and
endogastric tubes. A left-sided central venous catheter tip sits
at the mid SVC. A right-sided dialysis catheter tip sits in the
superior portion of the right atrium. The cardiomediastinal
contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Small
bilateral pleural effusions with basilar atelectasis persist.
The right lung base appears to demonstrate slightly more
consolidation than before, possibly representing an early
pneumonia or aspiration.

CT Head ([**2144-1-12**]):
A left temporal lobe area of hemorrhage is unchanged in size
compared to the previous examination with surrounding vasogenic
edema. The right temporal hematoma is also unchanged measuring
26 x 20 mm_. The small left subdural hematoma is unchanged as
well. No new areas of hemorrhage are noted. The ventricles and
sulci are normal in size and configuration. The visible
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells show opacification of
the left mastoid air cells, unchanged. The right zygomatic arch
temporal bone and sphenoid bone fractures as well as hemorrhage
in the right sphenoid cells is unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged right temporal probable epidural, small left
subdural and left temporal hemorrhagic contusion. No new areas
of hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Unchanged fractures and slight decrease in the blood in
bilateral sphenoid sinuse
