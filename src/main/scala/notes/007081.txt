Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall with low platelets

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R TFN

History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 y.o. female transfers from [**Hospital3 **] for
ortho eval.  Patient had a mechanical fall earlier that was
reported as a fall from standing.  She was reaching up to grab
some tea when she slipped and fell.  Her sister was in the house
and heard her fall.  She was awake when she found her.  No LOC.
She was taken to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she was found to have
sustained a right hip/humerus fx. CT of neck + spine cleared.
Her plt count was noted to be 2 and hct was 24 (? previously
29).  She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for tertiary care.
.
In the ED initial labs were 97.8 70 122/51 14 96%.  Exam was
significant for known injuries to right hip and right arm.
Ortho was consulted and recommended fixing the hip when plts
were improved.  Heme was consulted for ITP and anemia.  Heme
recommended starting IVIG and prednisone to increase plts for
preparation for surgery.
On transfer 70, 106/50, 16, 98%ra.
.
Review of systems:  Limited given difficult communicating.
Patient did report pain on right side of body.  She denied
fever, chills, shortness of breath and cough.  Did endorse
minimal chest pain, but unclear history.  Reported able to walk
up one flight of stairs without chest pain.

Discharge labs:
===============

Imaging:
========
R hip x-ray: Three AP views of the right hip and pelvis
demonstrate an impacted intertrochanteric fracture of the right
hip with slight overriding and varus angulation of the distal
fragment. The hip joint is aligned. The pelvis is notable for
marked osteopenia, which limits evaluation for fracture, though
none is seen. There are marked arterial calcifications.
.
Right shoulder x-ray: Three views of the right shoulder
demonstrate a mildly impacted, comminuted fracture through the
surgical neck of the right humerus, extending with a vertical
component through the greater tuberosity. The glenohumeral joint
remains aligned.
.
CXR: Mild cardiomegaly, no acute chest pathology.
.
CT pelvis:
1. Ill-defined hematoma within the right gluteus maximus.
2. Cystic structure within the pelvis. This should be correlated
for surgical history, and if the patient still has her ovaries,
this should be further evaluated with pelvic ultrasound to
exclude malignancy.
3. Redemonstration of intertrochanteric right femoral fracture.
4. Marked degenerative change of the visualized lumbar spine.
.
Repeat R shoulder x-ray: Again seen is a mildly impacted
fracture through
the right humeral surgical neck with extension into the greater
tuberosity in unchanged alignment. The humeral head appears
congruent with the glenoid fossa. There is a small 7-mm
inferiorly and medially displaced fracture fragment. Overall,
the appearance is unchanged.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 88 year old female with a history of untreated ITP
who sustained a mechanical fall and was found to have right hip
and humerus fracture now s/p R TFN.
.
# R hip and humeral fracture: patient with mechanical fall and
resultant hip and humerus fractures. Followed by orthopedics who
recommended sling for R proximal humeral fracture and non-weight
bearing, and surgery. In order to be safe for surgery, a
platelet count >50 and hct >28 was required. Hematology was
consulted regarding increasing plt count and anticoagulation in
this patient with fracture and DVT risk but complicated by ITP
as below, they recommended IVIG x2days ([**Date range (1) 83069**]) and
prednisone 1mg/kg (40mg) daily. They endorsed initiation of
standard anticoagulation once platelets were >50 and the pt was
started on metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] to decrease peri-operative
mortality. The pt was transfused to goal levels and on [**6-1**]
underwent R hip TFN. She subsequently had q8h CBC and was
initially transfused to plts >50 and hct >25, with heparin sc
TID given as DVT ppx. However, the pt's plts were incredibly
unstable and would fluctuate from 90s to <10 over the course of
several hours. Therefore, in discussion with heme and the pt it
was decided that it is not safe to DVT prophylax her at present
as the plts are consistently below 50 despite transfusion and
adding heparin or lovenox onto this would represent a
significant risk of hemorrhage which outweighs the risk of clot.
The pt was made aware of these risks and agreed with the plan.
Further it was decided to hold off on transfusions unless plts
fall below 30 or pt has significant hct drop. After about 10
days post-op the hope is that the risk of bleeding will
significantly decline and at that point the blood checks and
transfusions will cease assuming the pt remains hemodynamically
stable. The hematology team is also looking into the possibility
of giving N-plate. The pt will be discharged to LTAC where her
blood counts will continue to be monitored as detailed below.
She will follow-up with hematology as an outpatient.
.
# ITP: patient has history of ITP previously treated with rare
platelet transfusions and she has declined treatment for ITP in
the past. Platelet count was 8 on admission which improved to 32
s/p 1U platelets, then drifted down to 17. Heme/onc was
consulted and she was started on IVIG x2 days and prednisone
40mg daily with goal platelets >50 pre-operatively. After
surgery her plts were initially transfused to goal of >50 in
order to allow DVT ppx however given the instability of the plt
levels she was unable to continue ppx and instead was transfused
to goal >30 in order to decrease risk of bleeding. She will
continue with transfusions until her hct is stable despite low
plts. The pt received a total of 14 units of plts.
.
# Anemia: HCT of 19 on admission with unclear baseline. There
was initially concern for development of hematoma given low
platelets in setting of fracture and CT pelvis was done showi
