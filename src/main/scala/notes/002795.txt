History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4640**] is a 53-year-old former smoker with a prior history
of resected chest wall with invasive carcinoma of the lung
approximately 8 years ago. This was a right upper lobectomy with
en bloc chest wall resection, reconstructed with mesh. She also
had received postoperative radiotherapy. She presented several
months ago with a empyema necessitans draining through the low
right flank. This was traced up to a source arising from the
apical pleural space and mesh. I had previously reopened the
posterior aspect of her thoracotomy, removed the mesh, and
performed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72968**] window to marsupialize this and place her
on dressing changes. At this time, she was still smoking and
severely malnourished. We placed a percutaneous gastrostomy for
nutritional supplements, and she has gained approximately 4 to 5
pounds. She has been successful in quitting smoking. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of plastic surgery has also placed a tissue expander
under the right breast as she has very little muscular tissue to
help close this flap. It is our hope that a de-epithelialized
flap including the right breast skin and breast tissue along
with the pectoralis, as well as remaining tissue above the
thoracotomy, would be adequate to help close the defect if I
could also collapse the chest using a thoracoplasty. It was our
hope, with this combined technique, that we could close the
bronchopleural fistula and eradicate the space. She understood
the risks involved, including that this would not work and she
would be left with a chronic wound. She agreed to proceed.

Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 53 year-old female admitted to Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 4738**]
[**Name (STitle) 1092**] surgery service at the [**Hospital1 1170**] on [**2191-9-7**] for surgical management of [**Last Name (un) **] chest wall
reconstruction.  She underwent a bronchoscopy with aspiration of
secretions, right thoracoplasty with closure of bronchopleural
fistula, and combined pectoralis major musculocutaneous flap
containing entire right breast, transferred into the fistula
area and split-thickness skin graft, 200 cm2 on [**2191-9-7**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  For details operation, please refer to
the operative reports.  Following the surgery, she was
transferred to the CSRU.
.
On POD 1, she was continued on levofloxacin and ancef.  Her pain
was well-controlled with a dilaudid PCA, she was afebrile, had
good oxygenation, and adequate urine output.  Her VAC was
functioning, CT was continued to wall suction, and her arm sling
was continued.
.
On POD 2, her pain was well-controlled, however, she was over
sedated from the narcotics and her PCA was discontinued.  She
continued to remain afebrile with O2 saturation at 97% on 2L NC.
 Her antibiotics were continued.  Her VAC remained intact and
her CT was continued on wall suction.
.
On POD 3, she continued to remain afebrile and pain was
controlled with PO dilaudid.  The [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was placed to bulb
suction.  A CXR demonstrated almost complete opacification of
the right lung and a bronch was performed with removal of thick
brown/bloody secretions and mucus plugs from the right mainstem
bronchus, resulting in improved aeration of right lung.
.
On POD 4, her antibiotics was switched to cefepime to
pseudomonas cultured from BAL.  She remained afebrile and pain
well-controlled with PO dilaudid.  Again the patient required
another bronch following a chest x-ray with progressive
opacification of the right lung.  Clear thick secretions were
removed from the right mainstem bronchus.  The VAC continued to
be and continued on suction and her [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was continued to
bulb suction.
.
On POD 5, she was continued on the cefepime and remained
afebrile.  The VAC was continued as well as her [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain.
Her pain continued to be well controlled with PO dilaudid.  No
bronch was required on this day.
.
From POD [**5-13**], the patient continued to remain afebrile in the
ICU, requiring a bronch on POD 7 and POD 9 for removal of thick
secretions.  Her VAC was continued on suction and her [**Doctor Last Name 406**] was
continued on bulb suction.  Pain continued to be well-controlled
with input from acute pain service.
.
On POD 10, she had a fever of 101.9 with increased WBC to 45.6
and a CT chest demonstrated severe PNA of the right lung.  Her
antibiotics were broaden to include vancomycin, tobramycin,
flagyl, and the cefepime was continued.  The decision was made
at this point to have daily bronchs for removal of purulent
secretions from the right mainstem bronchus.  She also
complained of diarrhea and C.Diff cultures were sent. Her VAC
was continued on suction and her [**Doctor Last Name 406**] was continued on bulb
suction.
.
On POD 11, she continued to have low grade temperatures and her
antibiotics were continued.  A CT chest/abdomen/pelvis was
performed showing thickening and pericolonic inflammatory change
of the cecum and ascending colon, consistent with colitis.
Bronch today demonstrated moderate thick prurlent secretions in
the right mainstem br
