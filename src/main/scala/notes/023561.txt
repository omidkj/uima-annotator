INDICATION: S/P CABG. S/P chest tube removal.

COMPARISON: [**2195-8-4**]

UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The patient is S/P
median sternotomy and CABG. The heart remains stabily enlarged.
A right-sided single chamber pacemaker is again seen with single
lead overlying the right ventricle, in unchanged position. There
has been improved aeration of the left lung base with only
patchy residual atelectasis seen. A tiny right pleural effusion
is seen, decreased in size since the prior study. Pulmonary
vascularity is within normal limits. No pneumothorax is present.

IMPRESSION: 1) Improved aeration within the left lung space with
residual patchy atelectasis.

2) Tiny right pleural effusion.

3) No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2195-7-28**] to cardiology and the
decision of CABG vs. high risk PCI was revisited.  He was also
started on IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. The team decided
on surgery and on [**2195-7-30**] he underwent CABGx3 with LIMA to the
LAD, free RIMA to the diagonal, and R lesser saphenous to the
OM.  Cross clamp time was 63 minutes, total pump time was 85
minutes.  He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the CSRU in stable condition on Epi, Neo, and NTG.
He was extubated on his post op night and his drips were weaned
off on POD#1.  On POD#2 he had his wires and chest tubes d/c'd
and was started on coumadin.  He is on coumadin for his afib and
he also has a LV thrombus.  He continued to require respiratory
therapy and was transferred to the floor on POD#4.
EPS was consulted because the pacer was not sensing
apprpriately, and he had a malfunctioning V lead.  He was to
have it replaced and by the time his anticoagulation had
reversed, EP felt he did not need the pacer replaced and he did
not have significant bradycardia. He continued to progress and
was anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin.  On POD#9 he was
discharged to a telemetry monitored bed in stable condition.
