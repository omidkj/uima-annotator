Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
63 yo M with hx of CAD, COPD, DVT, without regular medical care,
admitted after being found down with altered mental status; with
hypoxemic respiratory failure, shock, on vasopressors; renal
failure, liver failure, and polycythemia.
Plans made for further treatment, including resuscitation,
empiric treatment and evaluation for undifferentiated shock
(septic, cannot rule out cardiogenic or obstructive shock).
However, after extensive discussion with the patients three
daughters, they noted that the patient has been explicit and
direct in stating (and apparently, writing) that he had would
not want to be on life support measures including intubation,
recussitated or with a feeding tube.  This was consistent with
his desire to avoid physicians and medical care in general, but
also came specifically after experience with immediate family
members who had been on life support.
The decision was made to withdraw life support measures
including vasopressors and ventilator and focus on comfort.  The
patient expired shortly thereafter.
