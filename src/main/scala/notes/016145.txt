Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16115**]
Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
78yo woman whose PMH includes DMII, HTN, RA, and recent
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer with liver metastases, s/p ERCP
with biliary stent on [**7-10**], p/w fatigue, near fall, found to
have hyponatremia to 117.

Home has [**4-20**] stairs in front of building that she must go up and
down for ADLs. Today while attempting with help of husband and
son [**Name (NI) **], legs very wobbly and weak while descending the
stairs. On way back up the stairs, legs buckled from underneath
her.  Husband and [**Name2 (NI) **] able to hold her up and get her to
elevator and to her apartment, then to chair. Once in chair,
felt better. No LOC, no head strike, no aura, no change in
behavior or focal neurologic findings reported. Period of
weakness lasted ~10 minutes. Called EMS, to ED.

In the ED, initial VS were:
97.0 90 118/70 18 99%

Labs were notable for Na of 117. UA notable for 15 WBC, few
bacteria, large leuks. EKG performed, unrevealing for acute
event. Neurological exam was performed which was fully intact
except for foot drop on the left (chronic).

Received 1.25 L of NS. Na bumped to 120.

On transfer to ICU, vitals were: 98 136/67 p77 sat 100 ra

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient relays similar history. Says has had poor
appetite and fatigue over past month, worse in the last week.
Also has had a cough recently, productive occasionally of clear
sputum, which her son thinks is [**1-17**] PND. But denies numbness,
paresthesias, fevers/chills, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea,
chest pressure, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, bloody
stools, dysuria, polyuria, urinary frequency, or incontinence.

[**2160-7-18**] RUQ US
IMPRESSION:
1.  Appropriately positioned CBD stent.  No intrahepatic bile
duct dilation.
2.  Unchanged 8 mm dilated pancreatic duct.
3.  Unchanged numerous hepatic masses.
.
[**2160-7-18**] CXR
CONCLUSION:

Mild left lower lobe opacities have improved since the morning.
This is
mostly due to atelectasis or aspiration.  There is no new
consolidation.

CT torso:

1.  Interval progression of hepatic metastases, more numerous
and confluent
since [**2160-6-20**].  Continued occlusion of superior mesenteric
vein.

2.  New moderate intra-abdominal ascites and increase in pelvic
ascites.  New
small bilateral pleural effusions.

3.  Right colonic edema, could relate to reactive changes in the
setting of
new ascites, although colitis cannot be entirely excluded.

4.  Slight increase in size of the known infiltrative pancreatic
head/uncinate
process mass with continued encasement of the superior
mesenteric artery
resulting in narrowing but no evidence of occlusion.  Unchanged
mesenteric
lymphadenopathy.

5.  New nodular density in left lower lobe may relate to
subsegmental
atelectasis given new bilateral pleural effusions.  Attention at
followup
imaging.

6.  Equivocal filling defect in a left lower lobe pulmonary
artery,
inadequately evaluated on this examination which is not targeted
for
evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature.  A tiny pulmonary
embolus cannot be
excluded.  Further evaluation could be obtained with repeat
chest CTA if
clinically indicated.

CXR [**2160-7-26**]:
FINDINGS:  The PICC line projects over the right atrium and
should be pulled
back 1-2 cm to be in the SVC- done.


Brief Hospital Course:
78yo previously functional woman with DMII, HTN, RA, recently
diagnosed with pancreatic ca with liver mets, last admitted
[**Date range (1) 20941**] for ERCP with stent placement to relieve N/V come in
this admission for poor po intake and weakness, found to have a
Na=117 and unexplained leukocytosis.

# Hypovolemic hyponatremia:
The etiology of the patients hyponatremia was likely due to
nause and vomiting and poor po intake. The patient presented
with a serum sodium of 117. She had no neurologic symptoms. She
was given 1.25L normal saline in the ED and her sodium rose to
120. She was admitted to the MICU where PO intake was encouraged
and supplemented with IVF. On the morning of [**7-17**] her serum
sodium was 127, so IVF were stopped. Later that morning it was
122, so 500cc NS were given. She remained without neurologic
symptoms but remained with decreased po intake and intermittent
N/V. She continued to receive intermittent IV fluids throughout
her hospitalization. A PICC was placed prior to discharge to
allow outpatient IV fluids as well. Given that she had a normal
mental status and was without pain or discomfort it was felt
that this may allow more quality time with her family. The
patient and her family were made aware of the potential risks,
including infection and clot.

# Mild hypothyroidism in setting of multinodular goiter s/p I
131
TSH was found to be elevated and her free T4 was at the lower
limits of normal.  The patient had been on synthorid in past for
a short period of time.  Endocrine was consulted and they rec'd
synthroid 50, and outpatient Endo at [**Location (un) 2274**] to be scheduled while
patient is at [**Hospital3 13990**].

# Anorexia with intermittent N/V: Persisted despite recent
biliary stent placement. RUQ US showed no significant change
from prior, and stent confirmed to be in proper position. Along
with elevated transaminases, ALP, and total bilirubin, symptoms
are attributed to significant tumor burden.
