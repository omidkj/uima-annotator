Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Trazodone / Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5134**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
53M hx hemangiopericytoma s/p resection ([**6-/2196**]), s/p
cranioplasty c/b MRSA infection ([**11/2196**]) resulting in removal
of bone graft and subsequent infection that presented two nights
ago with hypotension and hypoxia and subsequently found to have
bilateral pulmonary emboli.
.
Pt was in USOH until [**2-27**], pt's wife noted he had labored
breathing. Pt denied chest pain, palpitations, or any focal
symptoms. Symptoms worsened on of [**3-1**] when he was more visibly
short of breath with mild exertion walking to the bathroom. VNA
noted SBP in 80s and 02 in in the 80s. Pt subsequently BIBA.
.
Pt and wife denied recent fevers, cough, dysuria, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, or focal signs of infection. Wife noted
increased lethargy of the patient, but without change in mental
status (baseline pt respons yes/no. Pt is a chronic aspirator
and has a baseline cough that is unchanged.
.
In addition pt has had a complicated recent infectious course.
Pt underwent placement and removal of tissue expanders with
definitive cranioplasty ([**2198-9-21**]) and subsequent facial
cellulitis and sub-galeal abscess ([**Date range (1) **]/10) s/p I&D and 6
weeks of vanc/ceftaz/flagyl, now currently on suppressive
doxycycline therapy.
.
In ED, T97.6 HR117 BP103/61 RR20 O2 sat 94% 6L. The ED was
concerned for aspiration pneumonia, pt given
Cancomycin/ceftriaxone/flagyl. Then given hypoxia and
hypotension, pt underwent CTPA revealing extensive bilateral
pulmonary emboli, with signs of R heart strain and small
wedge-shaped opacity in the right lower lobe. Heparin gtt
initiated. He received 2 L NS. Pt was also seen by neurosurgery
and head CT showed no acute changes. Vital signs prior to
transfer were HR 111 BP 106/90 RR21 O2 sat 93%4L. Family
declined a central line, patient was transferred upstairs with
one 20 gauge peripherally after receiving a dose of tylenol.


Past Medical History:
# Left hemicraniectomy on [**2196-6-24**] for removal of a
hemangiopericytoma at [**Hospital6 1129**]
# Cranioplasty with placement of a synthetic bone graft on
[**2196-9-27**] c/b MRSA infection, now s/p wound revision on [**2196-12-10**]

with removal of cranioplasty
# s/p Cyberknife radiosurgery to the tumor from [**Date range (1) 81250**] to
3000 cGy (600 cGy x 5 fractions) at 83% isodose line
# Insertion of scalp expanders x2 [**2197-8-30**], s/p removal with
re-insertion and capsulotomy ([**2198-3-28**], [**2198-5-24**]), and now s/p
removal of tissue expander x2, capsulectomy/capsulotomy and
cranioplasty ([**2198-9-21**]).

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

[**3-1**] Head CT:IMPRESSION: Stable appearance again demonstrating
the large left
frontotemporal parietal craniectomy defect. No acute
intracranial process
identified.

[**3-4**] Head CT:IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of another acute
intracranial
process. No interval change.

[**3-1**] CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive pulmonary emboli involving upper, middle, and lower
lobar
arteries on the right and the upper and lower lobar arteries on
the left.
Wedge-shaped consolidation at the periphery of the right lower
lobe may
represent a small pulmonary infarction. Prominence of the right
ventricle and
flattening of the interventricular septum is concerning for
right heart
strain.
2. Bronchioles of the lower lobes bilaterally demonstrates
partial
opacification, concerning for aspiration. Density noted within
the trachea and
main bronchi bilaterally may also represent secretions, although
some of this
appearance may be due to motion arifact.

[**3-2**] LE U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower
extremity deep venous thrombus.
