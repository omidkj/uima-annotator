ketoacidosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was diagnosed with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in [**2188**].  He is followed
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10145**] at the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center.  He has

He was unable to tolerate p.o.   He denies fevers, shortness

strips.

He presented to the Emergency Department on [**7-27**] and was
noted to have a fingerstick of 539.  He was started on an
insulin drip and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
His anion gap at that time was 32.  He had complained of some
right upper quadrant pain and had a negative right upper
quadrant ultrasound.

q.p.m.   He was monitored with frequent fingerstick blood
sugars and continued to do well.  He demonstrated some
frustration and lack of understanding of his medical regimen.
Therefore, the patient had a learning center consultation to
discuss diabetic issues, checking his fingerstick blood
sugars and the importance of taking his insulin and following
blood sugars.  The patient also was seen by the [**Last Name (un) **]
