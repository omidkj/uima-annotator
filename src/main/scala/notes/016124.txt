[**2168-10-31**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
mild
diffuse disease.  The LAD had 90% proximal and 90% mid-vessel
stenoses.
The LCX was subtotally occluded at a major OM branch.  The RCA
was
subtotally occluded in the mid-vessel.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal central
aortic
pressures.
3.  The abdominal aorta was noted to be extremely tortuous on
arterial
access, requiring placement first of a 5F long sheath up to the
iliac
bifurcation before advancing a magic torque wire could be
advanced to
the aortic arch.  A 55cm [**Last Name (un) 28712**] sheath was advanced to the
mid-abdominal
aorta to provide support for the diagnostic angiography, which
was
otherwise uncomplicated.  This was exchanged for a 5F short
sheath at
the conclusion of the case.

[**2168-11-4**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present
in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial appendage
thrombus cannot be excluded. The spontaneous contrast was
reduced after an inotrope was started.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15
%). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The global LVEF
improved to 20% with inotropic support.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta at the level
of the LSCA.
5. . There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
trivial mitral stenosis. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of epinephrine, milrinone. Sinus rhythm at
100 bpm. Improved global biventricular function on inotropic
support. LVEF is now 30%. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] remain 1+. Aortic contour is
normal post decannulation.

[**2168-11-2**] CT Head
IMPRESSION:
1. Hyperdensity is noted in the right anterior cranial fossa
appering to be predominantly intra-axial hemorrhage, however,
components of extra-axial
hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
Findings were conveyed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1833**] at 5:00 p.m. on
[**2168-11-2**].
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above
interpretation. The
right frontal lesion appears to be most likely a hemorrhagic
contusion, but recommend comparison with the outside MR
examination.

[**2168-11-1**] Carotid Ultrasound
No significant carotid artery stenosis bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83853**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2168-10-31**] for a cardiac
catheterization and further work-up of his unresponsive episode.
Heparin was started along with a beta blocker. His cardiac
catheterization revealed severe three vessel disease. Given the
severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical revascularization. Mr. [**Known lastname 83853**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid
duplex ultrasound which showed no significant disease.
Levofloxacin was started for pneumonia. As he had bilateral
hygromas seen on an outside MRI, the neurology service was
consulted for clearance for surgery. It was determined that
these were at a very low risk for hemorrhage during
anticoagulation while on bypass. A CT scan was obtained which
showed no acute process. He was thus cleared for surgery. On
[**2168-11-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 83853**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Within 24
hours, Mr. [**Known lastname 83853**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative s
