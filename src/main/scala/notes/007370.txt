Radiology Report CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2122-6-14**]
1:12 PM
IMPRESSION:
Extremely limited examination due to lack of intravenous
contrast.

1. Cardiomegaly. Small bibasal effusions and pulmonary
ground-glass
opacities. The lung findings may represent infection, fluid
overload or ARDS.

2. AAA with an aortofemoral bypass graft in situ. The
appearances are
suggestive of an endoleak as described above.

3. Extensive atherosclerosis in the vasculature of the abdomen
and pelvis
including the coronary arteries.

4. Striated appearance of both kidneys, most marked on the
right. The
appearances may represent acute tubular necrosis from prior
contrast
administration.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted from an OSH with leaking AAA seen on OSH
imaging.  She was emergently taken to the angio suite and her
images were uploaded and reviewed.  She underwent:
1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of bilateral common femoral
    arteries.
2. Bilateral introduction of catheter into aorta.
3. Abdominal aortogram and selective iliac arteriogram.
4. Endovascular stent graft exclusion of ruptured abdominal
    aortic aneurysm with a [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] 31 x 14-1/2 x 130 main body
    endo prosthesis and right [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] 20 x 9.5 iliac limb and
    [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] 14-1/2 x 7 left iliac extension limb.
5. Perclose closure of bilateral common femoral
    arteriotomies.
6. Left common femoral endarterectomy with vein patch
    angioplasty.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Of note, she was not
intubated for the procedure given her age and co-morbidities.

Neuro: no active issues, patient is alert and interactive

Cardiopulmonary: Post-operatively she was closely monitored in
the CVICU. Initally her PPM was pacing her appropriately,
however, overnight she had an episode of asystole, lasting less
than 30 seconds. Compression were started, and the pt almost
immediately began pacing appropriately again. These episodes
recurred a few more times the evening of POD 0 and
electrophysiology was urgently consulted.  The EP fellow
interrogated the device and found the RV lead to be dislodged.
He adjusted the settings, and the pacer functioned properly.  He
recommended repleting electrolytes and discontinuing digoxin as
well.  These interventions resolved her arrythmias.  On [**6-16**]
the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response and required IV lopressor and then a diltiazem drip for
rate control.  EP and cardiology were asked to advise on
treatment.  Soltalol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] and diltiazem 30mg qid were
started and the diltiazem gtt weaned off. The pt returned to a
paced sinus rhythm within 24hrs of the atrial fibrillation and
had no further episodes throughout her stay.  Anticoagulation
was initally recommended, however given the pts age and
comorbidities it was decided that heparin/coumadin benefit would
not outway the risk, and thus asprin 325mg was initiated. On the
morning of [**6-16**] the patient began to c/o SOB, required increased
O2 and was hypoxemic on her ABG. There was concern for CHF
exacerbation as well as PE.  She urgently underwent CTA which
ruled out pulmonary embolis
