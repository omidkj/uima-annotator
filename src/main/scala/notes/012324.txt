Chief Complaint:
hypotension following right total hip arthroplasty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right total hip arthroplasty

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15568**] is a 71-year-old female
previously seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5322**] who presents to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a
right total hip replacement.  She reports that she had a motor
vehicle accident on [**2163-8-4**] when she was a pedestrian hit by a
car at a low speed and suffered from an intertrochanteric
fracture, which was fixed with a DHS by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85032**] [**Doctor Last Name 85033**].

The patient said that she initially had some relief from the
operation; however, has had progressively increasing right hip
pain ever since.  The patient, prior to her injury, was an
independent ambulator walking over three miles a day and now she
is wheelchair-bound in the community and walks with a cane at
home.  She does not ascend stairs.  The patient states that she
has [**11-12**] pain with any type of ambulation.  The patient has
tried numerous narcotic medications, which have not provided her
with any relief.

Images:
TTE ([**2165-1-9**])- The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2163-8-5**], the pericardial effusion is
smaller. The other comparable findings are similar.

Hip film ([**2165-1-8**])- Skin staples are present laterally.
Subcutaneous edema and emphysema, post-surgical. Status post
right total hip arthroplasty. The hardware appears intact on
this single view. No definite fracture or dislocation. Unchanged
degenerative changes of the pubic symphysis. Unchanged left hip
joint. IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative appearance status post
right total hip arthroplasty.



Brief Hospital Course:
71 F with h/o HTN, HL, COPD, pericardial effusion, OA, right
intertrochanteric hip fracture [**3-7**] MVA s/p hardware implantation
c/b degenerative joint disease, presents for elective right
total hip arthroplasty c/b post-op hypotension and admitted to
the ICU.

ICU COURSE:
#. Hypotension - transiently hypotensive post-op while in the
PACU, likely [**3-7**] hypovolemia as BP improved with 4L of IV
fluids.  Blood loss during surgical procedure reported to be
200cc, received 2 units of pRBC in the PACU.  Also happened in
setting of receiving 1 mg of dilaudid IV, question whether this
may be medications related.  Patient has also been using her
right hand quite frequently, which is where her arterial line is
placed, possibly transient hypotension in PACU was due to
position or kinking of A-line.  Given past hsitory of
pericardial effusion, concern was high for cardiac tamponade.
TTE showed small pericardial effusion (consistent with prior)
without tamponade physiology, pulsus of [**5-9**] mmHg.  BP improved
to 120-130??????s prior to transfer to ICU and remained stable
overnight.  Patient did not require further fluid boluses or
pressors.  Home antihypertensives were held.

#. Hypokalemia - found to have K of 2.9 which was repleted
overnight.

#. s/p THR- Patient's pain was controlled overnight on admission
with dilaudid pump. On HD1 when she was taking orals, she was
restarted on home methadone.  Dilaudid pump was titrated up as
pain was suboptimally controlled.  Drain was pulled by
orthopedics on HD1.

#. Hypertension- held lisinopril in setting of hypotension on
admission to ICU.

#. High cholesterol- continued home statin

#. COPD- stable on arrival. Oxygen was weaned.

#. Depression- continued home mirtazapine and sertraline

#. Osteoporosis- continued home calcium, vitamin D

The patient was transferred to the floor on POD#1. The surgical
dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was
found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal
drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs
were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is partial weight bearing
(50%) on the operative extremity with STRICT posterior
precautions.

Ms. [**Known lastname 15568**] is discharged to rehab in stable condition.
