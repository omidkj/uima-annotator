Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49 year-old woman with
restrictive lung disease, diastolic heart failure,
obstructive sleep apnea, requiring BiPAP and mental
retardation who presented with mental status changes and
increased lower extremity edema.  She was found to be hypoxic
at an O2 of 64% room air, unresponsive on arrival.  The
patient was also bradycardic on arrival and given Atropine
and diuresis. The patient was also given BiPAP.  Also in the
Emergency Room the patient was found to be in acute renal
failure and is immediately transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  In the Intensive Care Unit the patient
was given BiPAP and diuresed initially.  The patient was
hypercapnic initially.  These levels were monitored with
modest improvement on BiPAP.  The patient was also thought to
be in left heart failure, however, echocardiogram was
performed, which showed evidence of right heart failure. The
patient's creatinine and liver function tests were increased.
Renal and abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.
These levels were monitored and trended toward normal.  The
patient's beta blocker was held in the Intensive Care Unit as
she was bradycardic.  The patient was also treated
empirically for pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.  The
patient had mild improvement of mental status and was
transferred to the Medical Floor on Azithromycin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Restrictive lung disease FEV1 to FVC ratio 79, which is
104% predicted, decreased DLCO.
2.  Obstructive sleep apnea on home BiPAP.
3.  Pulmonary hypertension.
4.  Diabetes hypertension.
5.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
6.  Panhypopituitarism secondary to empty sella, low thyroid,
adrenal insufficiency, diabetes insipidus.
7.  Mental retardation.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 100 mg once a day.
2.  Lasix 20 mg once a day.
3.  Synthroid 50 mg once a day.
4.  DDAVP 0.1 mg b.i.d.
5.  Colace.
6.  Aspirin 81 mg once a day.
7.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg t.i.d.
8.  Zantac 150 mg po b.i.d.
9.  Combivent one to two puffs every four hours prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smokes two packs per day.  She lives with
her daughter who assists her in her activities of daily
living.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  Hematocrit 30.3, platelets 105,
AST 56, ALT 41, creatinine 1.6, INR 1.5, a.m. cortisol 5.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Mental status:  The patient has known mental retardation.
Vitamin B-12, folate, TSH, RPR was negative.  The patient
was managed conservatively on BiPAP and mental status
improved during hospital course without further intervention.

2.  Cardiac:  The patient had elevated troponin and CK
enzymes.  This is partly related to her heart failure and
renal failure.  Enzymes were followed and trended down.  She
did not complain of chest pain and had no changes on
electrocardiogram.  The patient also had bradycardia.  She
was monitored on telemetry on the floor.  Episodes of
bradycardia into the 40s were noted particularly when the
patient was asleep.  The patient was symptomatic during these
episodes.  The patient's beta blocker Atenolol 100 mg once a
day was held.  Bradycardia was secondary to medications in
the setting of acute renal failure.

3.  Dyspnea:  The patient has known pulmonary hypertension
and component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  She
was treated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare
with a Prednisone and Azithromycin course.  In addition, the
patient was given supportive care with nebulizers and MDIs of
Combivent.  The patient was given BiPAP at night with
positive response.  There is a question of aspiration
pneumonia.  Speech and swallow evaluation at bedside showed
some difficulty swallowing.  The patient was subsequently
placed on thickened liquids for possibility of aspiration.

5.  Anemia and elevated INR to 1.5.  The patient was
normocytic.  During hospital course INR continued to improve
as nutritional status improved.  There was no evidence of
hemolysis or blood loss.  The possibility of a evaluation of
bone marrow was considered, but deferred as an outpatient to
be evaluated.

6.  Renal failure resolved during hospital course with
intravenous fluids.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA and home oxygen.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Pneumonia, possibly aspiration.
4.  Acute renal failure.
5.  Thrombocytopenia.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Bradycardia secondary to medications.

FOLLOW UP:
1.  The patient is to follow up with her primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 110392**] [**Name (STitle) **].
2.  The patient was asked to follow up with pulmonologist and
endocrinologist in the next one to two weeks.
3.  The patient was asked to follow up with the cardiolgoist
to evaluate for bradycardia and right heart failure.
