History of Present Illness:
51 year old male with past medical history for significant
Hypertension, mitral regurgitation complicated by mitral valve
prolapse, and GERD who has had increasing DOE over the last year
with acute worsening over the past few months. Over the last
week he developed a cough which caused him to go to his
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was found to be hypertensive to SBPs with systolic
pressures in the 190s in the office and an EKG with NSR at
79bpm, normal axis incomplete RBBB biatrial enlargement, LVH and
inversions of the T wave in V [**3-27**]. He was referred to an outside
hospital emergency room, were he was admitted for rule out
myiocardial infarction.  He had negative troponin-I x4. Echo
showed MVP with severe PHTN, as well as a hypokinetic RV and
diastolic dysfunction. A CXR showed cardiomegaly without acute
cardiac decompensation. subtle increased interstitial markings,
probably chronic, no consolidation identified. He was
transeferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and a cardiac
surgery evaluation for a mitral valve replacement.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque. Normal aortic diameter at
the sinus level.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderate to severe (3+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate Rv dysfunction .The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 35cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There
is an A3 flail with a hole in the A3 leaflet,with moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. LV function is
>55%.There is 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Post
The patient is now s/p Mitral valve repair--A3 Chordoplasty with
Physio ring size 28
The patient is on a Norepinephrine drip @0.15 mcg/kg/min and
Milrinone @0.25 mcg/kg/min, the cardiac output is 4.2 lpm
The ring is well seated with no mitral regurgitation.The mean
gradient across the valve is 2mmhg
The Ejection fraction is 40%


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted same day surgery and was brought to the
operating room for mitral valve repair.  See operative report
for further details.  He received cefazolin for perioperative
antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive care unit for
post operative management. He required Milirone and Levophed for
hemodynamic management and had increased chest tube output.  Due
to increased chest tube output he was taken back to the
operating room for re exploration.  See operative report for
further details.  He returned from the operating room on
propofol for sedation and required nitroglycerin for blood
pressure management. In the first twenty four hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without complications.  He continued to do well and
was started on lasix and betablockers on post operative day one,
and transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy worked with him
on strength and mobility.  He continued to progress, chest tubes
and epicardial wires removed per protocol.  Betablocker was
increased at tolerated. On post operative day four he was ready
for discharge home with services.
