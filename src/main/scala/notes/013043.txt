Admission Date:  [**2166-7-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2166-7-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2110-10-2**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU/GREEN

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy and hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year old female
with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus
type 1, coronary artery disease, end stage renal disease with
calciphylaxis, who had been recently discharged from [**Hospital1 1444**] after a four week
hospitalization for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus bacteremia/line sepsis/pseudomonal wound infection.
This hospital course had been complicated by change in mental
status, hypoglycemia, discovery of a right atrial clot.  The
patient had been discharged on Estrianem and Vancomycin and
Flagyl after placement of a tunnel right groin catheter on
[**2166-6-27**], and was also on Lovenox for the right atrial clot.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **]
facility on [**2166-7-3**], and there became progressively confused
and delirious in the 24 hours prior to readmission to [**Hospital1 1444**].  The patient had been
dropping blood pressure to 50/palpable at the time of
transfer and was noted on blood cultures there to have one
out of two bottles growing gram positive cocci in pairs and
clusters from [**2166-7-1**].

In the Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure was
67/17 and the pulse was 66, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 88% in room air.  The patient received fluid bolus
with a transient increase in blood pressure and
electrocardiogram was obtained and found to be in atrial
fibrillation at 75 beats per minute.  Chest x-ray showed no
infiltrate or congestive heart failure.  The left internal
jugular was placed and the patient was started on Dobutamine
drip.  Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End stage renal disease with calciphylaxis.
2.  Diabetes mellitus type 1.
3.  Congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 14% and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
4.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia.
8.  History of VRE.
9.  Chronic sacral decubitus ulcer with pseudomonal
infection.

6.  Vancomycin.
7.  Flagyl.
8.  Estrianem.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine, Vicodin, Penicillin, Keflex,
Cephalosporin, Dicloxacillin, Gentamicin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient had been in rehabilitation
hospital since [**2166-2-15**], had been widowed in [**2163**], did not
drink or smoke.   The [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy was [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 4281**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, the patient
is lethargic but oriented times three.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are
intact.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Cardiovascular is
irregularly irregular with II/VI systolic murmur at the apex.
The abdomen is soft, bowel sounds present, soft with multiple
healing wounds and striae.  Extremities showed necrotic
digits on the lower extremities bilaterally, undressed wounds
on the lower extremity heels bilaterally, the hips with deep
wounds open to muscle and fascia and several wounds with
eschar.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the white blood cell count
was 10.5, hematocrit 29.3.  INR was 2.4.  Sodium 140,
potassium 5.0, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, blood urea
nitrogen 13, creatinine 7.5, glucose 50.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 55 year old female with multiple
medical problems including end stage renal disease
complicated by calciphylaxis and deep infected ulcers in
multiple places on her body, coronary artery disease, and
congestive heart failure, recent history of Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonal infections,
who is readmitted from the [**Hospital3 **] facility
with hypotension and possible sepsis.

1.  Hypotension - The patient was admitted with blood
pressure of 67/17, initially requiring pressor support with
Dobutamine.  Fluid boluses were attempted but the patient was
never able to support her blood pressure on her own.  The
patient's pressor requirement increased over the several days
of her stay.  She eventually was requiring three pressors for
support; Neo-Synephrine at 6, Dopamine at 16, Vasopressin at
0.04, even after she had been fluid resuscitated.  This
refractory hypotension was likely due to gram negative sepsis
which the patient and her antibiotics were not able to fight
off.

2.  Sepsis - The patient was found to have Klebsiella
bacteremia from blood cultures drawn both at the [**Hospital3 6373**] facility and here at [**Hospital1 190**] and this Klebsiella was sensitive only to
Meropenem and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.  Actually, it was a
wound culture from the outside hospital that grew the
Klebsiella initially.  The patient was eventually placed on
Meropenem without any apparent improvement in her clinical
status.  Antibiotics were continued until the decision was
eventually made to focus on the patient's comfort.  These
antibiotics also included Vancomycin.

3.  End stage renal disease - The patient was felt to have
also an infected dialysis catheter and the catheter was
removed shortly after her admission.  From that point
forward, she had no access for dialysis and it was felt by
the renal team who was consulted to be unstable for dialysis
and so she was not dialyzed during this admission.

4.  Respiratory - The patient was breathing and oxygenating
well, however, given her acidosis and the feeling that we may
need to give her additional fluids to support her blood
pressure, after discussion with the patient and her proxy,
she was electively intubated at that time.  The patient
remained intubated with no real improvement in her clinical
status until such time that it was decided to focus on
comfort measures.

5.  Decision making - The patient was initially quite adamant
about her desire that everything be done to try and improve
her clinical situation even though the team was quite certain
that she had a very, very poor prognosis.  Extensive
discussions were had with the patient and her health care
proxy in which the patient conveyed her feelings to the
health care proxy.  As can be seen from the above, initially
very aggressive measures were taken, multiple pressors and
multiple antibiotics.  The patient's clinical condition,
these measures not withstanding, continued to deteriorate
over the course of her stay.  She became unable to respond to
questions and after extensive discussions with the team and
the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, all were in agreement that
the prognosis for meaningful comfortable survival was zero as
especially given that the patient's ulcerated extremities had
become gangrenous.  All were in agreement that it was no
longer humane to prolong the patient's current pain and
postpone her notable passing with heroic measures.  At this
time, with the patient's proxy's permission, the patient was
made "comfort measures only".  Pressors, antibiotics, and
blood draws were stopped.  Fentanyl was continued for
comfort.

The team was called to see the patient at 3:00 on [**2166-7-13**],
when she stopped breathing.  The patient was found to be
asystole by monitor.  Her pupils were fixed.  There was no
response to sternal rub.  There were no breath sounds or
heart sounds after two minutes of auscultation.   The patient
was pronounced dead at 3:17 p.m. on [**2166-7-13**].
