Chief Complaint:
Fever from Facility

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
coronary artery disease, recent AVR who presents from rehab with
fevers and acute renal failure.
.
Recent long-term admission ([**7-9**] - [**8-25**]) with volume overload
and hypotension in the setting of severe aortic stenosis.  The
hospitalization was complicated by a slow GI bleed with notable
black tarry stools; an EGD showed evidence of gastritis and
duodenotis and a colonoscopy showed evidence of diverticulosis
but no evidence of
active bleeding.  Also during the admission, his trach was
changed three times secondary to persistent leak; tracheomalacia
extending to both mainstem bronchi was noted.  On [**2129-8-12**] he was
taken to the operating room where he underwent AVR.
.
In speaking with staff from rehab, patient spiked on [**9-6**]; was
started on vancomycin an ceftazidime for MRSA in the sputum and
ESBL in the urine.  Tip from PICC line grew staph on [**9-9**].
Zosyn was added on that day.  The creatinine was noted to
increase on [**9-11**] and the vancomycin was stopped.  Transfused
one unit of pRBC on [**9-13**].
.
On the morning of admission, spiked to 101.8.  Blood cultures
were sent and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Social History:
Non-smoker. Currently at [**Hospital 100**] rehab. Has several children.

hand) and does not make eye contact.  In no apparent distress
but grimaces often during physical.
heent - Trach in place.  Difficult to assess JVP.
cv - Hard to hear heart sounds over vent.  Irregular.  Systolic

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN [**9-17**]:
79 year-old male with a history of [**Month/Year (2) 8751**] and eventual trach,
coronary artery disease, AVR, diabetes who presents with fevers.
.
1. Fever and leukocytosis:
Transfered from rehab with culture data positive for ESBl E.Coli
UTI ([**Last Name (un) 36**]:zosyn, gent, imi, tetracyclin; resis: augmentin, amp,
ceftriaxone, aztreonam, cefepime.  He was sent from rehab on
vanc (History of MRSA in sputum) and zosyn, and on admission was
switched to vanc and meropenem. Pt had a pseudomonas culture
from his sputum which was initially thought to be contamination,
but given signs of PNA on CXR, was treated as a real infection.
There were no signs of MRSA infection on cultures so vanc was
discontinued (pt had been on a >10 day course starting in
rehab).  His old PICC line was replaced with a new IR guided
picc line early in his admission.  Given that pt had a ESBL UTI,
it was decided to give him a 14 day course of meropenem, which
would cover the organisms isolated from sputum culture as well.
Pt defervesed well on meropenem therapy.  There were occassional
isolated fever and WBC spikes which had negative workups (sputum
cultures continued to show pseudomonas contamination).  Later in
his hospital course, urine appeared cloudy and cultures
indicated yeast.  Foley was changed without resolution of
findings, so pt was given a 5 day course of fluconazole for
bladder candidiasis and had the foley changed after that course.

.
2. Acute renal failure:
Baseline creatinine of 1.0-1.1 at the time of prior discharge.
Pt came in with elevated Cr in the 1.8 range.  Pt was volume
overloaded from rehab along with fliud resucitation from
admission, so it was initially felt that volume overload in the
setting of history of CHF was causing poor forward flow and
decreased renal perfusion.  Pt was agressively diuresed on
admission, but Cr did not improve (though urine output was
appropriate). A course of low dose captopril (6.25mg tid) was
attempted to reduce afterload and increase forward flow, but
this caused pt to become hypotensive, so it was stopped after 1
day.  TTE was performed which showed EF of 70% without wall
motion abnormalities, but did show outflow tract obstruction
likely from intravascular depletion.  Renal US showed no
abnormalities. During diuresis, Cr varied from 1.7 to 2.0, and
it was assessed that this was likely a new chronic problem in
this patient. Will recommend checking BUN/Creatinine atleast
twice a week unless his clinical picture changes.
.
3. Respiratory Failure - Pt had been chronically ventilated
since his automobile accident earlier this year.  He had some
success with weaning in the past, but his respiratory status
would eventually fail and he would need to be intubated again,
and thus necessitated a tracheostomy.  Ventilator weaning was
attempted during admission, and pt did show some evidence of
being able to be weaned.  While initially unsuccessful at being
taking off of AC for more than 30 minutes, but by the time of
transfer he was able to stay on pressure support of 15/5 for
over 24 hours at a time, but then would tire and require higher
PS settings for rest.  It was noted that the pt was requiring
higher cuff pressures to prevent tracheostomy leaking.  IP was
consulted who stated that pt has a known history of
tracheomalicia, and that the pt's trachea is fairly large and
the current hardware available is a less than perfect fit.
Their recomendation is to accept higher cuff pressures with some
leak and that as long as the pt is being adqeuately ventilated,
there is little acute intervention that needs to be done at this
time.
.
4.Volume Overload: Pt was volume overloaded from rehab and from
fluid resucitation on admission. Diuresis was started with lasix
IVP, and at one point necessitating a lasix drip (Adjusted
between 2-7mg/h) to which he diuresed appropriately.  Lasix dose
needed to be adjusted frequently for hypotension.  Potassium was
repleted as needed while on drip. Lasix was switched to 40mg IV
bid.  As the pa
