History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10220**] is a lovely 66 year-old right-handed woman with a past

medical history including bronchiectasis who initially presented

to the urgent care clinic following a fall down the stairs and
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after a non-contrast CT of the head

was thought to show subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural
hematomas.

The patient explains that she awakened in her usual state of
health this morning. After a lunch of pizza at about noon, her
husband drove her to a housing complex so she could perform her
job for the census. She recalls turning on the light in the
stairwell to visit the [**Location (un) 1773**] apartment of interest. She
turned the light off before turning around to travel back down
the stairs. She next remembers seeing stairs come towards her
and thinking "I'm going down." She fell face forward down
several stairs. She thinks that she lost consciousness for a few

minutes at the foot of the stairs. However, she does remember
standing up of her own [**Location (un) **] and walking out to the car where
her husband was waiting for her. (He says she was inside for a
total of about 15 minutes.)

At that point a crowd of tenants in the building assembled and
volunteered concern over the amount of bleeding from her head.
Accordingly, her husband drove her to the urgent care center for

evaluation. She was subsequently transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and care when a non-contrast CT was thought
to
show subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematomas.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 10220**] was admitted to the neurosurgery service after she was
found to have a small left frontal subdural. She was also found
to have R non-displaced transverse extra-articular distal radius
fracture and transverse prox phalanx fx without complaints of
numbness, weakness secondary to pain.
She was admitted to the trauma ICU for  q1 hour neuro checks,
she was loaded with Dilantin and given 100mg tid. Her Aspirin
was held and BP was kept less than SBP<140. A repeat CT was
obtained in the morning showed the small left superior convexity
hematoma demonstrates posterior redistribution, and slightly
less decreased in density.
On her second hospital day she was transferred to the floor,
neurologically she remained intact. Plastic surgery placed the
patient in a cast. Her hand was eventually reduced at the
bedside and placed the patient in a new cast.
PT/OT saw the patient and recommended [**11-23**] more visits. She
worked diligently with PT and OT and was discharged home
neurologically intact on [**5-9**]. Plastic surgery offered her
surgery prior to discharge however patient wanted to be
discharged home and follow up in a week with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was
instructed to wear her sling at all times.
