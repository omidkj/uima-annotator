History of Present Illness:
83 year-old man with a PMH of HTN and HLD who developed abrupt
onset L sided weakness and was taken to an OSH and given tPA and
then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the ED he has a persistent dense L
hemiplegia as well as significant dysarthria. Repeat imaging
showed no bleeding or vessel obstruction, therefore no arterial
interventions are available.   He continued to have L
hemiplegia.  He did not pass a speech and swallow evaluation and
continued to have slurred speech.  He was started on tube feeds
via NGT.  Per his family, he did not speak, but was
communicating with them up to 1 day prior to his ICU transfer.
On the day prior to transfer, he was less communicative.

On morning of [**1-15**] he developed hypoxia with saturation of 79%
on room air. He was suctioned with return of tube feedings. He
was placed on NRB with oxygen saturation of 90-95% on the NRB.
An ABG was drawn with the following numbers 7.44/35/67 and he
was subsequently transferred to the MICU.

Upon arrival to the MICU patient was on NRB with oxygen
saturation of 95%, RR 40s, increased work of breathing,
tachycardic  110-130s. Decision was made to intubate patient.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2141-1-10**]  8:12:38 PM
Sinus bradycardia with 1st degree A-V block

RBBB with left anterior fascicular block
No previous tracing available for comparison

CT Head [**1-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Known acute right hemipontine infarction is not
well-visualized on the CT.
The perfusion of the MCA vascular territory is normal.
2. At least 75% diameter stenosis of the proximal portion of the
right
internal carotid artery, just distal to the bifurcation; this
could be
characterized further by focused son[**Name (NI) 867**].
3. Retropharyngeal course of the more distal cervical right ICA,
a normal
variant.
4. Mural irregularities involving both vertebral arteries with
calcification
at the origin of the right vertebral artery.
5. Left frontal encephalomalacia, most likely related to old
infarct.

MRI Head [**1-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute infarction of much of the right hemipons, likely on the
basis of
pontine perforating vessel occlusion.

2. Old left frontal and chronic microvascular infarction, with
significant
central atrophy.

3. Normal MR angiogram of the cranial vessels.

CT Head [**1-12**]
IMPRESSION: Evolution of right pontine infarction. No
intracranial
hemorrhage.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: [**1-19**]
1. No PE or aortic dissection although evaluation for
subsegmental PE is
limited due to motion.
2. Significant left lower lobe collapse, bilateral effusions.
3. Traumatic inflation of Foley catheter balloon in the penile
urethra.
4. Hypoattenuating collection in the bladder likely related to
hematoma.
5. Appearance of gastrostomy tube is suspicious for traversing a
loop of
transverse colon prior to entering the stomach.

Abd X-ray [**1-19**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of contrast extravasation or free air.

TTE [**1-11**]
The left atrium is elongated. No thrombus/mass is seen in the
body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
