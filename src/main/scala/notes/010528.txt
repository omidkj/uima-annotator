History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 78047**] is a 58 year old female with history of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy with LVOT gradient of 89 who presented to OSH
with cough, fever, and malaise x2 days. Two days prior to
admission she had began to have subjective fevers, chills,
nonproductive cough and myalgias. Her son had been sick with
similar symptoms the week prior. She also had an episode of
chest pain the morning prior to admission which developed while
she was getting dressed. It is described as a sharp, stabbing
pain in the epigastrium. The pain was associated with
post-tussive emesis and shortness of breath. It lasted 10
minutes and was relieved with rest. The pain returned yesterday
evening after she climbed a flight of stairs, however this time
the discomfort radiated to her left arm. She had associated SOB.
Both the pain and the shortness of breath were relieved with
sitting down. Her son found her sitting on the floor yesterday
evening and called 911. She was taken to [**Hospital1 2436**] ED.
.
At OSH CXR showed question of PNA and she was treated with
Levaquin. Patient became hypotensive with systolic BP 70s and
was started on dopamine and given 1.2L of IVF. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED here patient's vital signs were T 100.4, BP 149/61
(went as low as 78/50), HR 94, RR 30, 97% on NRB, CVP 12. CXR
was done which showed increasing pulmonary edema, however
subsequent CT torso was notable for RUL PNA. A RIJ was placed
for access and confirmed on CXR. She was treated with
ceftriaxone for additional treatment of PNA. Dopamine was
switched to neosynephrine as patient was tachycardic.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. At
baseline she is able to ambulate [**12-31**] blocks without shortness of
breath or chest pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and dyspnea
on exertion. Negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.

CTA Torso:
1. Right upper lobe and left perihilar opacities, consistent
with pneumonia.
2. Cardiomegaly with elevated right heart pressures.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism within the main, right, or
left pulmonary arteries.
4. No acute intra-abdominal process.
5. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Clinical correlation is
recommended.

ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diffuse
ST-T wave abnormalities most likely related to left ventricular
hypertrophy, but cannot rule out underlying myocardial ischemia.
Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available
for comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension, likely a
combination of worsened outflow tract obstruction from volume
depletion and possible septic physiology. The patient required
neosynephrine for approximately 24 hours. She was aggresively
resuscitated with IVF and was able to be weened off the
neosynephrine. She was also treated for her RUL PNA with
levofloxacin. She was ruled out for ACS by negative cardiac
enzymes. Her beta-blocker was changed to metoprolol and
restarted prior to discharge.

RUL PNA: Seen on CXR and confirmed on CTA. Likely community
acquired bacterial pneumonia vs. viral. Started on 7 day course
of levofloxacin. QT was monitored and unchanged in the setting
of Norpace use.

CAD/Ischemia: ST/T wave changes on initial EKG with chest pain
with exertion. Chest pain is likely demand ischemia with
tachycardia and LVH. Per her son's report recent negative stress
test. Ruled out for ACS by 3 sets negative CEZ. Restarted on BB
prior to discharge.

Pump: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with gradient of 89mm Hg,
worsened in setting of hypovolemia. Received 5L IVF to increase
preload. Continued on Norpace and beta-blocker.

Prophylaxis: Subq heparin, PPI, bowel regimen

Code: Full code, confirmed with patient.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy
Pneumonia
Viral Gastroenteritis


Discharge Condition:
All vitals stable, afebrile, on room air


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a pneumonia and a low blood pressure.
This was likely because you were dehydrated. You were given IV
fluids to rehydrate you and started on antibiotics to continue
after you leave. You also showed no signs of a heart attack or
heart damage based on labs and your EKG.

We have changed and decreased your blood pressure medication
while your blood pressure is lower. This may be increased by
your primary care physician at [**Name Initial (PRE) **] later date.

Please take all your medications as prescribed and make all the
recommended follow up appointments.

Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you
experience chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, fevers,
chills, inability to keep down liquids, or any other symptoms
that concern you.

Followup Instructions:
Please call your primary care physicician to make a follow up
