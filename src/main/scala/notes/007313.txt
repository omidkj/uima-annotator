Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, transfer from 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year-old female with newly diagnosed
metastatic malignancy,  who presents from the out-patient
gynecology unit with complaints of progressive shortness of
breath.

She was recently evaluated as an out-patient for complaints of
weakness, abdominal pain and shortness of breath. At that time,
an abdominal U/S was obtained, which revealed an enlarged uterus
with an echogenic mass. Further work-up included an abdominal
MRI remarkable for an enlarged uterus, thickened endometrial
stripe, and a vaginal mass. A CXR was also obtained, concerning
for metastatic disease, and a CT chest subsequently confirmed
pulmonary metastases, without PE. An MRI brain was negative. She
was seen by an oncologist at [**Hospital3 **], and seen today on the
day of admission in the [**Hospital 6669**] [**Hospital **] clinic for a biopsy of
the vaginal mass, which was performed.

She reports a 2-week history of progressive shortness of breath,
with progressive limitation in exercise tolerance. She endorses
a cough, largely non-productive, and tightening "like a band"
around her chest, without definite pleuritic chest pain. She
reports no PND, no orthopnea, no lower extremity edema. She
denies fever or chills. Recent HIV test negative. No sick
contacts at home. While in the [**Hospital **] clinic, her saturation was
noted to be 86% on RA, and she was referred to L&D triage on the
[**Hospital Ward Name 516**]. From there, she was admitted to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**], where
concern was raised over her breathing status, and she was
transferred to the ICU for close monitoring. Saturation 90-95%
on 6L  NC at the time of transfer.

She endorses a 40-lbs weight loss in the past 8 months. No night
sweats. No fever as noted above. No history of abnormal PAP,
last in 09/[**2163**]. Normal mammograms, last in [**2162**]. No
colonoscopy.

Past Medical History:
1. Metastatic malignancy as above
2. Fibromyalgia

Social History:
She lives at home with her husband. They have no children. She
is a lifelong non-smoker.

Family History:
Sister with uterine cancer at age 53, other sister with breast
cancer at age 50, mother with breast cancer at age 74. She has a
brother who is healthy. No testing for BRCA done.

RELEVANT IMAGING DATA:
[**2165-5-2**] PELVIC U/S: The uterus measures 11.6 x 9.2 x 11.1 cm
and is
heterogeneous in echotexture and contains a 9.2 x 5.4 x 6.7 cm
echogenic mass anteriorly.

[**2165-5-6**] CXR: Multiple nodular opacities in both lungs,
concerning
for metastatic disease.

[**2165-5-7**] MRI BRAIN with gad:1. Nonspecific white matter changes.
2. Several small foci of increased T2 signal in the cerebellum
most,
consistent with chronic ischemic injury.

[**2165-5-7**] MRI PELVIS: The uterus is enlarged measuring 10.9 x 9.7
x 10.0 cm. Endometrial stripe markedly thickened measuring
approximately
5 cm. Several large uterine fibroids. Large T2 hypointense T1
isointense enhancing myometrial fibroid in the right aspect of
the uterine fundus, 5.0 x 5.3 cm in diameter. Second large
anterior fundal fibroid measuring 5.0 x 5.7 cm which has mass
effect on the endometrial stripe, slightly hyperintense the T2
sequence and enhances following administration of contrast.
Smaller usual myometrial fibroids are seen elsewhere. Evidence
of a mass in the posterior superior vaginal wall. Marked
thickening of the posterior wall of the vagina with a focal mass
superiorly and posteriorly that measures 2.5 by 1.4 cm. This
projects slightly posteriorly and deforms the right ventral
aspect of the rectum. Note is made of a prominent left iliac
chain lymph node which measures approximate 8 mm in short axis
dimension.

[**2165-5-9**] CT CHEST/[**Last Name (un) **] with contrast: 1. Innumerable pulmonary
metastases. 2. Enlarged uterus with soft tissue in the
endometrial canal which appears confluent with a fundal fibroid.
 Differential diagnostic considerations include endometrial
carcinoma invading a fibroid or a leiomyosarcoma invading
endometrial canal. Both endometrial carcinoma and
leiomyosarcomas of the uterus had been described to demonstrate
vaginal metastases.

[**2165-5-13**] CT CHEST/[**Last Name (un) **] WITH CONTRAST: 1.  No evidence of
pulmonary embolism. 2. Innumerable noncalcified nodules, and
masses within the lungs concerning for metastatic disease. 3.
Right hilar lymphadenopathy. 4.  Enlarged uterine mass, as per
patient history.

[**2165-5-27**] CT CHEST: 1. Slight regression in overall tumor burden
with decrease in the size of most of the pulmonary nodules by
10-20%. The increased lung volumes are due to ventilation. 2.
Slightly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. 3. New bibasilar
atelectasis and pleural effusion.

Pathology [**2165-5-13**] Vaginal biopsy: Poorly differentiated
carcinoma, favor squamous cell carcinoma, involving lamina
propria of squamous mucosa. No definitive in situ component or
lymphovascular invasion is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 year-old woman with newly diagnosed metastatic malignancy
with innumerable pulmonary metastases and progressive
respiratory decline. Her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course will be briefly reviewed by
problems.

1) Pulmonary: As noted above, her initial CT chest was
remarkable for innumerable pulmonary metastases, without PE
(although a subsegmental PE could not be excluded). Given her
respiratory compromise and hypoxemia, she was admitted to the
ICU on the day of presentation. Empiric Levofloxacin and Flagyl
were initiated to cover for a possible pneumonia or
post-obstructive process, even though no definite airway
compression or obstruction was seen on imaging. The pathology
from her vaginal biopsy eventually returned as poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and per
Hematology/Oncology, systemic chemotherapy was initiated with
Carboplatin and Taxol (day 1 on [**2165-5-14**]). Following
chemotherapy, her respiratory status continued to decline, and
she was intubated electively. She required continued mechanical
ventilation, without clinical signs of improvement.

2) Metastatic malignancy: As noted above, pathology from her
vaginal biopsy eventually returned as poorly differentiated
carcinoma, most likely squamous. Hematology/Oncology was
consulted, and systemic chemotherapy was initiated with
Carboplatin and Taxol (day 1 on [**2165-5-14**]). Following initiation
of chemotherapy, she developed febrile neutropenia, and
antibiotic coverage was broadened appropriately with Aztreonam
and Vancomycin in addition to Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Caspofungin was subsequently added given persistent fevers
without a
