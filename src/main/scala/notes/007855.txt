Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and had a left thoracotomy with left
upper lobectomy, thoracoscopy with mediastinal nodal resection,
cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy, and flexible bronchoscopy
which he tolerated well and was transferred to the PACU in
stable condition.  He had an epidural placed for pain control.
After the surgery, the patient developed delirium with confusion
and moderate dysorientation.  Neurology was consulted to provide
recommendations.  A head CT was obtained which was negative for
acute pathology.  Low dose haldol was provided for agitation.

On post-op day 3, the patient developed some respiratory
distress with tachypnea and oxygen saturations in the 70s on
room air as well as atrial fibrillation.  The patient was placed
on a non-rebreather, given nebulizer treatments, and lasix and
transferred to the ICU.  Chest x-ray revealed left lung
collapse.  A CTA was done to rule out PE.  The patient had a
bronchoscopy for therapeutic aspiration of copious amounts of
thick sputum with reinflation of the left lung.  The patient's
respiratory distress resolved after this.

The patient was able to be transferred back to the floor the
following day.  From a neurological standpoint, the patient's
mental status gradually improved over his hospital course.  The
patient was started on an amiodarone drip for his atrial
fibrillation and this was transitioned to a PO regimen.  The
patient was able to tolerate a regular diet at discharge and his
pain was well controlled.  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course,
he did have elevated amylase levels at 1300, but this trended
down.  It is possible that this elevated level was due to his
lung cancer.  An abdominal CT showed no pathology.  The patient
was discharged in stable condition.
