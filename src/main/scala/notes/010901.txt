History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68 year old male who presented to [**Hospital3 **] last night with a complaint of sudden onset of severe
abdominal pain starting around 9:30 pm. He was transiently
hypotensive in the outside ED and responded to fluids. He was
scanned and then transferred by helicopter to [**Hospital1 18**]. En flight,
the CT finding of AAA was called into the [**Hospital1 18**] ED by the
outside
hospital. The vascular surgery team was immediately notified and
the endovascular on-call team was activated. Upon arrival, the
patient was hemodynamically stable. The CT was uploaded and the
patient was emergently transferred from the ED to the
endovascular room for planned EVAR.

CT SCAN:

IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower lobe density is less well defined than on prior
study as it
blends with adjacent atelectasis.

2. There is a lobulated mass which appears solid and is based
along the left oblique fissure.

3. A smaller left upper lobe spiculated nodule is also seen.

4. There is a large parly necrotic extensively infiltrating
mediastinal mass. Findings are concerning for multifocal
malignancy with associated mediastinal adenopathy.

5. Large layering bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis.  Stable pericardial effusion.

6. Sliding hiatal hernia. Oesopahgeal dilation noted -
obstructing lesion is not excluded.

7. Surgical absence of the gallbladder with nonspecific mild
intrahepatic
ductal dilatation.

5. Status post aortoiliac endograft placement. Normal patency
and
opacification. Aortic aneurysmal sac appears without active
extravasation or new hemorrhage. It has slightly decreased in
size. Retroperitoneal and
pelvic hemorrhage persists and displaces the pancreas and
nondilated bowel
loops.

ECHO:

The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is borderline mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **] W. was admitted on [**9-16**] with AAA. He agreed
to have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, he was consented.
A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained,  all
other preperations were made.

It was decided that she would undergo a:

OPERATIONS:
1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of bilateral common femoral
    arteries.
2. Catheter bilateral catheter placement to the abdominal
    aorta.
3. Abdominal aortogram.
4. Endograft exclusion of the infrarenal abdominal aortic
    aneurysm with a [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] 23 x 14.5 x 140 main body with a 14
    x 7 cm extension and a 14.5 mm x 120 mm contralateral
    limb.
5. Perclose closure of the left common femoral artery.
6. Failed Perclose closure of the right common femoral
    arteriotomy and the right common femoral endarterectomy
    with bovine patch angioplasty.

He was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well without
any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, he was extubated and transferred to the PACU
for further stabilization and monitoring.

He was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While
in the VICU he recieved monitered care. When stable he was
delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult was obtained. When
he was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative care,
he was transfered to floor status

On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. He was discharged home in stable
condition.

To note Pt was found to have lung nodule on xray, CT scan
obtained. IP consult for bx. uneventfull bx. he ha follow up
with pulmonary and chest surgeru

Also had difficulty swallowing. GI consult. Had EGD. polyp was
found this was biopsied. Followup arranged.
