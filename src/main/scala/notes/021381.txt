PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, his vital signs are
temperature of 96.8 F.; blood pressure 129/65; heart rate 72;
respiratory rate 20; 98% on three liters on initial
evaluation.  In general, he was alert and oriented times
three in no acute distress.  Mucous membranes were moist with
notable conjunctivitis with some mild exophthalmus.  His
extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx was notable for
poor dentition.  His neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy
and no jugular venous distention.  His heart was irregularly
irregular with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur in the right
upper sternal border.  His lungs were notable for coarse
rhonchi; no wheezes or crackles.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.  His
extremities had petechiae on the left leg with onychomycosis
and no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY:  His laboratory data on admission included a CBC
with a hematocrit of 29.5, white blood cell count of 8300,
platelet count of 94.  His chemistries had a sodium of 138,
potassium of 4.0, chloride 104, bicarbonate of 24, BUN of 23,
creatinine 1.9, glucose 91.  INR of 2.1.

Chest x-ray showed new linear atelectasis in the left mid
lung zone with no obvious evidence for congestive heart
failure or pneumonia.

An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with a rate in the sixties,
normal axis and intervals and no acute changes since prior
examination of [**2198-12-8**].

The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital 139**] Medical Service for
management of his shortness of breath given his complex
cardiac history.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was admitted with the
presumptive differential diagnosis of shortness of breath
secondary to congestive heart failure versus pneumonia versus
anemia.  He was transfused one unit of packed red blood
cells.  He was also ruled out for myocardial infarction as
the potential cause of his congestive failure.  He was
continued on his home medications with increased Lasix for
diuresis.  He had no obvious evidence for pneumonia and
improved slightly with diuresis; however, given his aortic
stenosis as a potential source of his increasing shortness of
breath, Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was called.

The patient had prior outpatient appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for an aortic valve replacement, however, given
his recurrent worsening cardiopulmonary status, the question
of moving to surgery sooner was discussed.  Based on the
Cardiothoracic Surgery recommendations, a Cardiology
consultation as well as Dental consultation was called.

The Dental Service recommended an Oromaxillofacial Surgery
consultation for removal of his teeth prior to any
cardiovascular surgery.  The Cardiology Service felt that he
would benefit from inotropic therapy and gentle diuresis.
Therefore he was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for
Dobutamine therapy.  After stabilizing his shortness of
breath with diuresis in the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient
was transferred to the floor for preoperative management of
his aortic stenosis.

On [**3-12**], he was taken to the Operating Room for a
dental extraction which he underwent without complication.
He returned to the floor in stable condition.  The patient
had been on a heparin drip for his atrial fibrillation which
was held for the procedure.  After waiting 48 hours
postoperatively, the heparin drip was resumed.  Shortly after
he resumed heparin drip, the patient had bleeding from the
extraction site which will be discussed further under the
Hematology and anemia section below.

Due to difficulty controlling his bleeding, the patient's
valve surgery was delayed and it was felt that he would
benefit from better medical stabilization as well as
improving functional status prior to surgery.  The remaining
following week of his hospitalization, the patient had
continued improvement, however, upon re-evaluation for
cardiothoracic surgery, the patient as well as the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Team felt that he was not at a stable
enough place for surgery.  Because of this, the surgery was
again delayed.

After improving to a more stable position, a discussion was
held between the Interventional Cardiology Medicine,
Cardiothoracic Surgery teams as well as the family.  Based on
this discussion, it was felt that the patient would benefit
most from an aortic percutaneous transluminal valvuloplasty
as a bridging procedure to assess for any improvement prior
to a more invasive and potentially morbid procedure of
cardiothoracic surgery and aortic valve replacement.

On [**3-27**], the patient underwent the valvuloplasty in
the Interventional Cardiology Suite without complication.
His peak to peak pressure, aortic to ventricular pressures
were reduced from 50 to 40.  During and following the
procedure, the patient's heparin drip was held for
approximately six hours.  It was restarted per Cardiology
recommendations.  He had no further bleeding or
complications.  The following day, the patient was in
excellent spirits and had no complications from the
procedure.

He was able to work with Physical Therapy and ambulate as we
will discuss below.  At the time of this dictation, the
patient is planned to convert from heparin to his prior
warfarin therapy.  He will start his 2.5 mg of warfarin
following a 24 to 48 hour window with no evidence of groin
hematoma or complication of the valvuloplasty procedure.  He
will also transition to low molecular weight heparin
injections for outpatient adjustment to warfarin.  In
addition, he will follow-up with his primary care physician
as well as Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] or a member of the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Group for further discussion of aortic
valve replacement based on his functional status and
improvement over the coming weeks to months.

He will continue on his home medications as per admission for
his other cardiovascular conditions including coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
Of note, the patient was kept on Telemetry during his stay in
the hospital and had alarms for atrial fibrillation which
