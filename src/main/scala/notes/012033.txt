History of Present Illness:
  This is a 76 yo male [**Hospital3 2558**] resident with hx COPD and
recent admission for HCAP presents with SOB and cough for a few
days.  He reported three days of worsening SOB with a worsening
cough with increased yellow-white sputum production. He says
that this episode feels similar to his prior pneumonias.  He
noted associated weakness and fatigue since Wednedsay.  In the
ED, initial VS were 97.6 93 159/83 32 100% on 10L. He albuterol
nebs, ipratroprium nebs, solumedrol 125mg, Azithro 500mg IV and
Ceftriazone 1g IV. A CXR was read as hyperinflated lungs, with
subtle opacity in the lower lungs, without pleural effusions or
PTX. Labs were notable for lactate 1.4, BUN 23, HCT 37.9, and
eos 6.9% of 8.2 WBC. Blood cultures x 2 were sent.  He went into
an atrial arrythmia requiring a dilt drip so was admitted to the
ICU.

Of note, most recent PFTs indicate FEV1 1.49 44% pred in [**2181**],
read as severe obstruction. Recently hospitalized from
[**Date range (3) 33359**] with a COPD exacerbation treated with
moxifloxacin and a prednisone taper. A prior admission from
[**Date range (3) 91682**] for fever, chills, and productive sputum
revealed an HCAP; his microbiology revealed a PSEUDOMONAS
AERUGINOSA resistant to Cipro, Gentamycin, indeterminate to
Meropenam, Zosyn, and Tobra, but sensitive to Amikacin,
Cefepime, and Ceftazidime. That admission was also complicated
by an NSTEMI which was medically managed, without cathereization
[**12-30**] patient's wishes. A [**2184-8-24**] ECHO showed LVEF 50%, PASP 49
mmHG, and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with basal to mid inferior/inferolateral/inferoseptal
akinesis/hypokinesis.

On arrival to the MICU, he was tachypnic and tachcyardic.  He
had profuse oral secretions.  Chest PT, acappella, and good
cough helped secretions.  His steroids were started at
solumedrol 125mg q6h and transitioned to pred 60mg this morning
for COPD exacerbation.  No infiltrate on CXR no leukocytosis or
fevers, but MICU decided to treat him empirically for HCAP also
as he is a poor substrate with low FEV1.  Urine legionella was
negative.  He was weaned from o2 now on RA.  Sputums negative to
date, ROMI done, and Echo only with pulm htn.  His dilt drip
converted to oral metoprolol.  He had afib with RVR 1 hour prior
to his tid metorprolol dose so this was increased to qid.  He
had some urinary retention so a foley catheter was placed and a
UA/UCx was sent.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, he also endorses yellow-white productive sputum,
SOB, hweezing, chronic rihonnorea and chongestion, weakness.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness. Denies chest pain,
chest pressure, palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes or skin changes.

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**1-28**] CXR: COPD with presumed scarring in the lower lungs as
compared with
multiple prior exams. If there is strong clinical concern for
pneumonia,
recommend a dedicated PA and lateral view to further assess.

[**1-29**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Doppler across
tricuspid valve suggestive of tricuspid valve prolapse with mild
tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Hyperdynamic left
ventricular systolic function with normal size and regional wall
motion. Normal right ventricular size and function. No
significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

[**1-29**] CXR: 1. COPD. 2. Suspected right apical and right lateral
base pulmonary nodules. If clinically inidcated, further
assessment with CT would be recommended. 3. Patchy opacity both
bases. Differential diagnosis includes atelectasis versus
infectious infiltrate.

[**1-30**] CXR:
Cardiomediastinal contours
