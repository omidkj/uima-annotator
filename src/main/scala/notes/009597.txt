ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
man with a past medical history significant for MI,
angioplasty in [**2097-8-5**].  The patient had a recent
cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel disease
including left main stem disease.  The patient also had
complaints of unstable angina.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  MI, status post angioplasty in [**2097-8-5**].
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypothyroid.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Glaucoma.
8.  Anemia.
9.  Thrombocytosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient is
an elderly man in no acute distress.  Chest:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Warm, noncyanotic,
nonedematous times four.  Neurological:  Grossly intact.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  CBC:  5.6/12.3/35.0/227.  PT
14.0, INR 1.3, PTT 38.5.  BUN 23, creatinine 0.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for coronary
artery bypass grafting times three.  Intraoperatively, the
patient was noted to have mild to moderate bleeding from the
beginning of the case.  The LAD artery was found to be quite
calcific and the decision was made to do a vein patch
angioplasty.  Endarterectomy was necessary.  This anastomosis
was treated with fibrin glue.

As the case progressed, the patient had evidence of ongoing
bleeding not at surgical sites.  He was transfused massively
and observed in the Operating Room after the chest was close.
An output of 500 cc in the first hour and 110 in the next
half an hour after that.  At that point, a decision was made
that the patient had a platelet dysfunction responsive to
platelets, DDAVP, and cryoprecipitate.

A stat Hematology consultation was then made and the patient
was taken to the ICU for close monitoring.  The patient
received large amounts of blood products including at least 3
units of packed red blood cells, 4 bags of platelets, 8 units
of FFP, and one bag of cryo as well as 22 units of DDAVP.
His hematocrit was as low as 17.4.

Hematology recommended aggressive resuscitation with blood
products and maintain fibrinogen greater than 100.
Unfortunately, the use of blood products obscured the
etiology of the bleeding.  In the immediate postoperative
period, the patient required high amounts of pressors.

The patient was maintained on the ventilator and was unable
to wean.  On postoperative day number three, bronchoscopy
revealed tracheobronchitis with Moraxella growing from the
sputum.  The patient never exhibited any clinical symptoms of
a bronchitis or a respiratory infection.  He was
presumptively treated with Levaquin.

The patient was extubated without incident later that day.
The patient continued to have intermittent blood
requirements.  The patient had productive secretions on cough
but continued to improve.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
number six without event.  The patient's floor course was
essentially unremarkable and Physical Therapy worked on gait
training as well as strengthening and conditioning.
Ultimately, the patient was discharged on postoperative day
number seven after having been cleared for discharge to home
by Physical Therapy.  The patient on discharge was tolerating
a regular diet, and adequate pain control on p.o. pain
medications and having no anginal symptoms.  He did have a
small oxygen requirement, saturating approximately 95% on 2
liters and dropping down to about 91 to 92% on room air, but
it was felt that this would improve with physical therapy and
continued ambulation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  General:  The patient was
in no acute distress.  The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm
without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended.  There was no click.  No drainage
from the sternum.  The extremities were warm and noncyanotic
with only trace pedal edema.  Neurologically, the patient was
intact.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
4.  Percocet 5/325 p.r.n.
5.  Levothyroxine 50 micrograms q.d.
6.  Bimatoprost 0.03% drops one drop O.U. q.h.s.
7.  Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. times two days.
8.  Betaxolol 0.25% drops one drop O.U. b.i.d.
9.  Brimonidine tartrate 0.2% drops one O.U. b.i.d.
10. Lasix 20 mg q.d. times seven days.
11. Potassium chloride 20 mEq times seven days.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  Home with VNA.

DIET:  Cardiac diet.

DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to follow-up with
Cardiology in one to two weeks and address the need for
diuretics and adjustment to cardiac medications at that time.
The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four
weeks.  The patient is encouraged to continue ambulation as
well as incentive spirometry.
