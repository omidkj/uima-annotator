Pertinent Results:
CT trachea
1. No evidence of tracheobronchomalacia or stenosis.

2. Findings that may be consistent with recent median sternotomy
and thoracic surgery if sternotomy was performed within the past
15 days. Please correlate with time of surgical procedure.

3. Several slightly enlarged mediastinal nodes which are likely
hyperplastic but could be followed to ensure resolution or
stability if warranted clinically.

4. Bilateral small pleural effusions with likely lower lobe
atelectasis.

5. Splenic hypodensity which could represent a hemangioma or
possibly an infarct. Consider ultrasound for further
characterization, if warranted clinically.

[**2138-5-30**]: ECHO
Conclusions:
Technically suboptimal study due to poor image quality.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen, but Doppler does not suggeste
aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve is not well
seen. No
definite mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure
could not be determined. No pericardial effusion is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU from OSH after reportedly suffering
V-fib arrests prior to transfer. Once stabilized, pt underwent a
bronchoscopy [**2138-5-29**] that showed no evidence of TBM. CTA
confirmed no TBM. transferred from ICU on HD #3.  Evaluated by
neurology for autonomic dysfxn. Recommended Tilt table and other
recommendations: Evidence of autonomomic dysfunction on formal
testing (full report to follow).  Pt. had labile blood
pressures,
which if sustained, may cause symptoms of orthostatic
intolerance.  Autonomic dysfunction may be secondary to DM
and/or
multiple myeloma.  With regards to his neuropathy, this may be
related to DM, multiple myeloma, and/or Velcade.
Treatment recommendations:
For treatment we recommend ample hydration and salt intake.
Generally, we recommend 2L of fluid and 10gm of salt per day.
Given his recent cardiac history, this may not be possible to
achieve, but maximize therapy as can be tolerated.  Avoid
medications that may worsen orthostatic hypotension.
Deconditioning will also contribute to this problem and we
recommend physical therapy as tolerated.  Light compression
stockings and an abdominal binder may help prior to physical
therapy.  It may be necessary to avoid heavy compression given
his diabetic neuropathy.  If he remains orthostatic and is
unable
to tolerate physical therapy, it may be necessary to start low
dose midodrine, 2.5mg at 7am, noon, and 4pm.  This can be
titrated up as needed by 2.5mg per dose.  As it may contribute
to
supine hypertension, it should not be given after 4pm or prior
to
the patient lying supine.  Another option would be to dose
midodrine prior to physical therapy.  If midodrine is started,
it
would be best to check orthostatic blood pressures 1/2 hour
before the dose, and [**1-21**] after the dose.
