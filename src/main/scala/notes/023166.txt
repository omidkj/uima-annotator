Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, [**Last Name (un) **]

- Interventional Pulmonary thoracentsis and chest tube placement
& removal
- Intubation / extubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55yo F with Hx of Lymphocyte Depleted
Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of ABVD in [**2149**]-[**2150**] and recent
admission [**Date range (1) 102512**] for fatigue and fevers diagnosed with EBV
who presented today to clinic for scheduled infusion of IVIg and
was noted to have shortness of breath.  The patient states that
she has had difficulty breathing for the past few months but her
dyspnea on exertion has increased.  She notes an intermittant
cough for the past 2 weeks with occasional sputum production
which is unchanged.  She denies any fever, chills, sick
contacts, or recent travel. Labs were drawn in clinic which
revealed [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr from baseline of around 1.2 to 1.8), elevated
LDH, and hyperbilirubinemia. IVIg was held and the decsion was
made to admit the patient for further evaluation. Also, pt
endorsed worsening SOB with exertion. She does not use O2 at
baseline, but at rehab started using 2L yesterday. In clinic,
initial vitals BP 114/71, HR 114, Weight 250.5, BMI 46.6, T
98.1, RR 18, O2 sat 93-94%, improved to 96% on 2L.
.
Last admission, pt had an extensive workup for her systemic
complaints as pt endorsed that she felt similar to her initial
Dx with Hogkins disease. Including EBUS with transbronchial
needle aspiration, right cervical lymph node biopsy, BMBx, renal
Bx, and VATS with lung biopsy, limited thoracotomy and
mediastinal lymph node biopsy. Of note, she was initially
admitted to the MICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and fever in
the PACU status post
rigid bronchoscopy for mediastinal LN biopsy She had previously
been evaluated at [**Hospital1 2177**] for these complaints prior to transferring
her care to [**Hospital1 18**]. Her course last admission was also
complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] and anasarca, abnormal LFTs, and
pancytopenia. Ultimately, patient was found to have
hypogammaglobulinemia and prolonged EBV viremia, possibly
resulting in her abnormal LFTs, nephrotic syndrome, and
macrophage activation syndrome.

Studies:

[**12-22**] RUQ US:
1.  Stable mild wall thickening in a non-distended gallbladder
is a non-specific finding.
2.  Small amount of gallbladder sludge.  No cholelithiasis or
evidence of cholecystitis.
3.  Small right pleural effusion.

[**2160-12-20**] CT CHEST:
1.  Decreased right pleural effusion.
2.  15 mm right lower lobe nodular opacity which is new or
increased since
[**2160-7-27**] in an area previously obscured by right pleural
effusion; given
size, follow-up options include repeat chest CT within three
months or PET-CT.
Given adjacent right hilar opacity, this could represent
infection, in which
case follow-up after treatment is recommended.
3.  Stable underlying diffuse interstitial pulmonary changes.

[**2160-12-2**] CT CHEST
IMPRESSION:  As compared to the previous examination from
[**2160-11-10**],
there is evidence of diffuse fibrotic lung parenchymal pattern
with
bronchiectasis and spectral distortion as main morphological
components.  In
addition, mild fluid overload could highlight the appearance of
the
interstitial structures.
