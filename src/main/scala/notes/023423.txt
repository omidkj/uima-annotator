dyspnea on exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valve replacement (#29 [**Company 1543**] porcine) [**5-18**]


History of Present Illness:
 This 61 year old psychiatrist has a history of
hypertension,hyperlipidemia and CAD, s/p LAD Cypher stenting in
[**2110**].  In addition, he has moderate to severe aortic
insufficiency that has been followed by echocardiogram through
the years. The patient reports that over the past year he has
noticed a decline in his activity tolerance because of  fatigue
and dyspnea on exertion. He recently saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] in
consultation where his echocardiogram revealed a minimal change
in his aortic insufficiency. He is now being referred for
cardiac
catheterization to further evaluate his symptoms.

Findings
61 yr old male w/ pmhx CAD and AI w/ progressive regurg and
exercise intolerance. Pre-CPB: EF was noted to be normal to low
normal at 50-55%, no significant RWMA, moderate to severe AI was
also seen. No evidence of ASD was recognized.
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size. Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. No masses or vegetations on
aortic valve. No AS. Moderate to severe (3+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
post. CPB: patient weaned off with 0.6 mcg/kg/min phenylephrine,
EF and RWM unchanged. 29 mm [**Company 1543**] bioprosthetic well seated
valve noted. No significant residual AI or AS was seen. Finding
communicated to attending cardiac surgeon.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve is bicuspid. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 7635**] is a 61 yo man with known AS/CAD. He was a direct
admission to the operating room for a scheduled aortic valve
replacement. Please see OR report for details, in summary he had
an aortic valve replacement with a #29 [**Company 1543**] Mosaic porcine
valve, his bypass time was 86 minutes with a crossclamp of 64
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable
condition. In the immediate post operative period he remained
hemodynamically stable, within several hours he woke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He remained
hemodynamically stable but stayed in the ICU on POD1 to monitor
his pulmonary status. On the mo
