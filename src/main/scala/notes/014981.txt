EKG-NSR: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Frequent atrial
ectopy. Left anterior fascicular block. Late precordial R wave
transition. Non-specific  ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
prior tracing of [**2167-1-8**] no diagnostic interim change.

C-spine xray: Extensive destructive changes centered at the C4
level and involving the contiguous endplates, with accompanying
marked angular kyphosis and retrolisthesis, unchanged in extent
since the [**12-19**] study, with interval increase in the already
marked prevertebral soft tissue abnormality. These findings
correspond to the apparently known listeria infection with
osteomyelitis, and interval progression of, particularly the
soft tissue component of this process would be best assessed by
contrast-enhanced MR examination, when feasible.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2167-1-27**] 9:06 AM
The patient is post anterior spinal fusion with 2 upper screws
in the body of C3 and 2 lower screws in the body of C6 with
anterior plate, and bone graft interposed between C3-C6.The bone
graft is somewhat placed toward the left side of the plate. The
right screw in the C6 body is in close proximity to the
posterior cortex but there is no cortical break or extension
into the spinal canal. Osteolytic destruction of parts of the
C3-4 and C4- C5 disc/endplates is again noted with soft
tissue/disc material extending into the spinal causing
idnentation on the thecal sac. However, accurate assessment is
limited on the present CT study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a  65 yr old man with DM2, CAD, OSA, ESRD on HD, s/p
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ([**12-11**]), with recurrent
bilateral shoulder pain.

On [**1-26**], the patient [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a C4,5 corpectomy, anterior
arthrodesis C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6; anterior instrumentation
C3-C6 and structural allograft with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**]. The patient was
transferred to the SICU because he was intubated postoperatively
due to his extensive medical history. Postoperative CT of the
C-spine on [**Last Name (STitle) **] 1 showed post operative changes and opacification
of the right lung apex. The patient was weaned off the
ventilator after the CT scan on [**Last Name (STitle) **] 1. The patient received
hemodialysis on [**Last Name (STitle) **] 1 with a resultant drop in blood pressure.
Normal saline was given for a total of 900cc with a rebound in
systolic blood pressure to 120s. Hemodialysis was completed and
the patient was started on a phenylephrine drip to keep his SBP
greater than 90mmHg. He was weaned off of the drip at 5am on [**Last Name (STitle) **]
2. He was transferred to the Medicine Service on [**Last Name (STitle) **] 2 prior to
receiving his hemodialysis. While on the medicine service, the
patient was stable, and his drain was removed on [**Last Name (STitle) **]#3, and
sutures removed without a problem on [**Name2 (NI) **]#4. The patient was
discharged off both his aspirin and [**Name2 (NI) 4532**] with close follow up
at neurosurgery clinic on [**2167-2-4**] for follow up for his second
surgery. After completion of his surgery, he will follow up with
the neurosurgeons on when to restart his aspirin and [**Date Range 4532**] for
stroke prevention.

Shoulder pain: There was no significant change in neurological
exam. Pain mostly like chronic because of destructive
spondyloarthropathy--an amyloid deposition disease of cervical
spine. (Final EM is pending.) However, it was important to rule
out worsening cord compression or other acute process.
Neurosurgery was consulted and no changes on neurological exam
were noted. Repeat MRI was done, wh
