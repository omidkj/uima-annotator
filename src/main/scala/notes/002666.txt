History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old lady with pulmonary HTN (on adcirca,
tyvaso, letairis), CAD s/p stents, HTN, and recent T5 + T8
compression fractures, diastolic CHF, and multiple other medical
problems who presents because she is feeling unwell and has been
short of breath lately.
.
She has been feeling unwell since her discharge from our
hospital on [**2135-6-7**]. At the previous admission she was found to
have two new spinal compression fractures at T5 and T8. She was
treated for pain with tramadol, lido patch, and tylenol, but
hasn't been taking her tramadol recently because she was worried
about its long-term effects. She states that she has been
splinting and not breathing well because her back pain worsens
with movement, breathing, and lying flat. Back pain is [**2133-4-16**].
She states that she is still ambulatory and has always been SOB
when walking, but it's worse now. She denies chest pain, cough,
or recent episode of choking. She has required 5L of oxygen
today but is usually on 4L at home.
.
As for her UTI, she denies dysuria, hematuria, urinary urgency
and frequency, as well as nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills.
She does endorse cloudy urine. She was discharged on her last
admission with cipro 500 [**Hospital1 **] x 8 days (ended [**6-8**]) to treat a
UTI.
.
Due to feeling poorly, she saw her PCP today, who referred her
to our ER. At home today her BP was low - 80/50. Of note, she
recently started hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg QHS three days ago.
She also complains of leg edema to her hips, but states it's
much improved today.
.
* has had pneumovax in last few years

Review of sytems:
(+) leg edema
 negative unless mentioned above.

Past Medical History:
- Coronary artery disease status post inferior MI with
subsequent Cypher stenting to the mid RCA in [**2130-4-11**].
- Non-ST elevation MI in [**2133-12-12**] with cardiac
catheterization that showed 80% OM1 lesion with subsequent
stenting of the OM with a 2.5x18mm Endeavor DES. The LAD was
stented with a 2.25 x 20 mm Taxus stents as well as an
overlapping proximal 2.25 x 8 mm Taxus stent.  This procedure
was
complicated by a small distal wire perforation without any
extravasation. Due to a balloon-induced dissection in the LAD, a
3.0 x 23 Promus stent was deployed as well as a 2.5 x 12 mm
Promus stent deployed in the LAD.
- Chronic dyspnea on exertion with diastolic dysfunction and
known pulmonary hypertension with right heart catheterization in
[**2134-11-11**] showing a PA pressure of 71/28 with a mean PA
33mmHg with a wedge of 8mmHg. She was not responsive to
vasodilator challenge in cath lab and thus is on advanced
therapy with adcirca and tyvaso reporting mild symptomatic
improvement.
- Hypertension.
- Hyperlipidemia.
- TIA, bilaterall less than 40 % carotid stenosis  ([**2130**])
- bladder diverticulosis
- Obstructive Sleep apnea-Does use BiPAP
- s/p right total knee replacement
- osteopenia
- GERD
- s/p total Hysterectomy
- Lung surgery to correct large diaphgram hernia
- Kidney stone
- childhood asthma

Social History:

Radiology:
[**2135-6-25**] Portable CXR:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
increase in interstitial markings and an increase in diameter of
the pulmonary vasculature.  In conjunction with the increased
cardiac silhouette, these findings are suggestive of mild to
moderate pulmonary edema.  The presence of a minimal left
pleural effusion cannot be excluded, given blunting of the left
costophrenic sinus.  At the time of observation and dictation,
10:38 a.m., the referring physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 96051**] was paged
for notification, on [**2135-6-25**].
Given that no lateral radiograph was performed, the compression
fractures
cannot be evaluated.

CXR [**2135-6-24**]: FINDINGS: "Massive degenerative changes in the
cervical spine, but no evidence of compression.  Mild
compression of T5, massive compression of T8.  As compared to
previous chest radiographs that are available from [**2135-6-22**], these changes are constant.  However, if compared to the
chest radiograph of [**2134-11-2**], these changes have
massively progressed. No evidence of new vertebral compression.
The lumbar spine shows anterolisthesis of L5 with respect to S1
and moderate degenerative changes, but no evidence of vertebral
compression.  Extensive vascular calcifications. "

EKG [**2135-6-25**]:Sinus rhythm. Prior inferior wall myocardial
infarction. No major change from the previous tracing.
