Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided neglect

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cerebral Angiography s/p intra-arterial tPA


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a very pleasant 86 year old right handed male with
history of hypertension, ? COPD, now presenting with left sided
neglect. The patient is not fully aware of his deficits, hence
he is not able to provide a complete or reliable history. He had
been feeling well lately with "chronic trouble breathing."
Otherwise he was last well apparently last night. This morning a
friend called him and home and he was dysarthric. EMS was called
and he was found on the floor of his home. When asked, the
patient reports that he does not have any neurologic deficits.
Hence neurologic ROS is negative. He denies any headache or
vision problems.

General ROS, pt denies f/c/NS, ? chronic SOB/DOE, no CP, no N/V,
no abdominal pain, no diarrhea or constipation, agnosia

Past Medical History:
HTN
COPD well controlled on Spiriva
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
Chronic lower leg edema (tinea -feet)
Obesity

designated a HCP, retired auditor, never smoker, denies ETOH or
illicit drug use.

IMAGING:
ECG ([**4-12**]): Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular
response at a rate of 84. Left bundle-branch block with
secondary ST-T wave abnormalities. No previous tracing available
for comparison.

CXR ([**4-12**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process

CT Head ([**4-12**]):  IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process seen on nonenhanced CT. Please
note that
MRI is more sensitive to evaluate for acute ischemia.
2. Hypodensities within the white matter, subcortical,
paraventricular, which could be due to chronic small vessel
ischemic changes. Focus of hypodensity in the left thalamus,
which could be due to old ischemic event.
3. Mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses, more on the
right, with possible mucus retention cyst in the right maxillary
sinus.
4. Lucent areas in the bony calvaria, could be venous lakes, but
metastases or multiple myeloma can have similar apperance.

CTA Head/Neck and CTP ([**4-12**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Abrupt cutoff of the right MCA just distal to the M2 branch
and branches distal to the M2 are not visualized. There is a
perfusion mismatch in distribution of the MCA with approximately
30% penumbra identified. No areas of hemorrhage identified on
non-contrast images.
2. Subtle loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the right
insular ribbon. Otherwise no other areas concerning for
infarction.
3. Remaining intracranial vessels are patent without evidence
for aneurysm, stenosis or occlusion. Bilateral vertebral and
internal carotid arteries are normal.
4. Decreased pneumatization seen in bilateral mastoids and
questionable mastoidectomy on the left and would recommend
clinical correlation.
5. Hypodensities in an enlarged left lobe of the thyroid, and
would recommend correlation with biochemical markers and thyroid
ultrasound if clinically indicated.
6. Questionable outpouching at the left PCA origin likely a
prominent branch as no aneurysm was seen on angiogram performed
on same day.

Cerebral Angiography ([**4-12**]): IMPRESSION: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an
86-year-old male who presented with acute left-sided neglect.
CTA and perfusion showed acute stroke in the right M2
distribution with a 20-30% salvageable penumbra. A total of 6 mg
of TPA were infused in divided doses into the right common
carotid artery and right internal carotid artery. Satisfactory
flow was demonstrated after the infusion.

CT Head ([**4-12**]): IMPRESSION: Interval development of hyperdensity
in the right insular and temporal cortex, most likely due to
luxury perfusion s/p revascularization. Cortical microhemorrhage
cannot be definitively excluded due to persistent intravascular
contrast from the preceding cerebral angiogram, and a repeated
study is recommended in 12 hours for reassessment.

TTE ([**4-13**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus/mass
is seen in the body of the left atrium. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 55-60%). with normal free wall contr
