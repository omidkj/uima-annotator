Allergies:
Motrin / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation.
Chest CT
Hemodialyis with additional ultrafiltration sessions.

History of Present Illness:
HPI:  69-yo-woman w/ HIV, COPD, ESRD on HD presents w/ shortness
of breath x 2 hours.  She reportedly was feeling well until 7pm,
when she developed dyspnea at rest.  The dyspnea became
progressively worse over the next 2 hours, prompting
presentation to the ED.  The pt did not complain of any fever,
chills, increased cough, chest pain, abd pain, melena, or
hematochezia.  On arrival in the ED, her  temp 103, HR 162, BP
230/104, RR 38.  She was in acute resp distress and was
intubated immediately and placed on CMV ventilation.  Propofol
gtt was started for sedation, resulting in decreased BP to
70/42.  Propofol was then d/c, and levophed was added, resulting
in increased BP to 118/55.  Initial CXR was concerning for PNA
w/ diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and the pt was treated w/
levo/vanco/ flagyl/bactrim/hydrocortisone.  The MICU team was
then called for further evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
Initial chest x-ray.
1. Endotracheal tube properly positioned with tip at the
thoracic inlet.

2. Findings consistent with severe pulmonary edema with possibly
etiologies including congestive failure or, less likely, ARDS.

[**2115-12-4**] chest x-ray.
Resolution pulmonary edema

Initial chest CT.
There is an endotracheal tube in place. The airways are patent.
There is no pericardial effusion. There are no filling defects
in the pulmonary arterial vasculature. No pulmonary embolism is
identified. Some calcifications are seen in the coronary
arteries, the aortic arch and descending aorta. Otherwise, the
heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There is mild
bilateral pleural effusion. There is no axillary
lymphadenopathy. There is a precarinal 16 x 17-mm lymph node.

Interval increase in size in the spiculated mass located in the
right upper lobe measuring now 34 x 24 mm concerning for lung
cancer. New extensive patchy areas of ground-glass opacities are
seen throughout the lungs, mostly compromising the upper lobes .

Limited images of the upper abdomen did not demonstrate
significant abnormalities.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no concerning bone lesions.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Confirmed the findings in the axial images.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. Diffuse ground-glass opacities through the lung parenchyma,
concerning for PCP or pulmonary interstitial lymphoma with
underlying probable lung cancer in the right upper lobe.

3. Bilateral pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 year old woman with HIV on HAART (last CD4 940),
CHF (EF 50%) COPD, eosinophilic pneumonia, prior DVT and PE on
coumadin, and ESRD on HD who presented to this hospital on
[**11-28**] for 2 dyspnea and was found on arrival to be in acute
respiratory distress.  She was intubated immediately and placed
on CMV ventilation.  Of note the patient also became hypotensive
soon after a propofol drip was started for sedation. Propofol
was then discontinued, and levophed was added, resulting in
increased BP to 118/55.  The initial chest x-ray was concerning
for PNA as diffuse interstitial infiltrates were visualized.
The pt was admittted to the MICU and was treated empirically
with broad spectrum antibiotics along with hydrocortisone for
possible COPD exacerbation. In the MICU the pt was weaned off
pressors fairly quickly, extubated by hospital day 2, and was
subsequently transferred to the floor.  It was believed that her
respiratory distresss had a large component secondary to fluid
overload which was treated by hemodialysis.  She underwent
several rounds of ultrafiltration in addition to her regular
hemodialysis which resulted in improvement of her volume status
as evidenced by her improvement in respiratory status, her
physical exam, and by resolution of pulmonary edema on chest
x-ray.

Her course on the medical [**Hospital1 **] was complicated only by one
episode of chest pain that was not associated with EKG changes
and for which she ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes.  As her
admission INR was subtherapeutic, she was maintained on a
heparin drip along with coumadin for her history of DVT and PE
until therapeutic INR was reachieved.  Her hospital course on
the [**Hospital1 **] was otherwise unremarkable.  She was discharged
breathing normally on room air and with instructions to finish
her empiric course of antibiotics.

Of note, review of her chest CT scan with the pulmonary service
revealed that a previously noted mass in the right upper lobe
had increased in size in comparison to a chest CT performed 3
months ago.  This raised concern that this mass may be
malignant.  She was to follow up with the pulmonary service
regarding this finding.

In summary, this is a 69 year old HIV positive woman on HAART
with CHF, COPD, ESRD on HD, and history of DVT and PE on
coumadin who was admitted in respiratory failure, intubated
briefly and treated empirically for pneumonia with broad
spectrum antibiotics, for COPD exacerbation with steroids, and
with hemodialysis for evidence of CHF exacerbation.  Her
respiratory status satisfactorily improved with these treatments
and it was felt that her presentation was largely secondary to
volume overload from CHF exacerbation.

Issues and plan arising from this hospitalization.

1. Pneumonia/Resp failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure now seems
to have been from pulmonary edema from CHF exacerbation.
Contriubtion from pneumonia/reactive airway disease and
eosinophilic PNA also possible. Status post extubation [**11-29**],
doing well.
- breathing improved well with serial ultrafiltration sessions
along with dialysis.  Pt to continue regular dialysis sessions
as outpatient.
- question PNA; although no source was identified, pan cultures
were unrevealing, Pt received empiric 10 day course of
levofloxacin, flagyl, and vancomycin (start [**11-28**])
- AFB smear negative, PCP negative
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] serum CMV IgG positive,
