Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
asymptomatic CAD and mitral regurg

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with saphenous vein
    graft to the posterior descending artery.
2. Mitral valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 12523**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] epic
    tissue valve, reference number [**Serial Number 112134**]
    #[**Serial Number 112135**].


History of Present Illness:
81 year old female was found to have a systolic murmur as far
back as [**2159**]. In [**2167**] she was noted to have [**11-28**] + MR, 1+ TR, and
a normal EF. Peak gradient of 61mmg across the LV outflow tract.
In [**2170**] she developed asymmetric septal hypertrophy, 2+ MR, and
mild pulmonary hypertension. She has remained essentially
asymptomatic. Recent surveillance echo in [**2175-2-26**] now
demonstrates MVP, 3+MR and severe pulmonary hypertension. She
walks daily, approximately two miles over ?????? hour to 45 minutes,
without any difficulty. She was referred for a cardiac
catheterization for further evaluation. She was found to have
severe mitral valve regurgitation and a RCA lesion. She was seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and surgery was discussed. She underwent preadmission
testing and presents to clinic today for further surgical
discussion and consent.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
Prebypass:
The left atrium is normal in size. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal estimated (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There
is moderate/severe P3 leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). Hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy is not visualized on this exam, Left Ventricular
Outflow tract is patent. Unable to obtain deep transgastric
images for further LVOT and Aortic valve assessment. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results on [**2175-7-5**] at 1000.

Postbypass:
Well seated prosthetic valve in the mitral position. No evidence
of perivalvular leak. Mean gradient 2 mm Hg, Peak 5mm Hg across
mitral valve. Left ventricular function is grossly unchanged
from prebypass. There is no evidence of aortic dissection.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2175-7-5**] where the patient underwent Coronary
artery bypass grafting x1 with saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery. Mitral valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 89505**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] epic tissue valve, reference number [**Serial Number 112136**] #[**Serial Number 112135**].

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Cefazolin was
used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic support and a small amount of vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker therapy was initiated and the patient was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  She
developed AFib and was started on Amiodarone and Coumadin.  Beta
blocker was titrated as tolerated.  Chest tubes and pacing wires
were discontinued without complication.  The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #6 the
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
to home in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
