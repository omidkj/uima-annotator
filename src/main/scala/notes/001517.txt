History of Present Illness:
63yo man with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
bipolar disorder found on bathroom flor prone and incontinent of
urine/stool.  Initially, he was arousable to verbal stimuli with
eye opening and incomprehensible verbal response.  Vitals at
this point were 102/64, 90, 24, and 96%.  There was a question
of right facial asymmetry.  Hereafter, there was decreasing
level
of mental status with no response to verbal or pain.

In ED, vitals were 101.2, 98, 70/30, 20, and 100% on NRB.  After
2L NS bolus, blood presure increased to 110.  Narcan was given
with no effect.  He was intubated with etomidate and
succinylcholine.  He was given 50mg of charcoal by OG tube.  He
was given vanco, ceftriaxone, and flagyl. Neosynephrine was
started with BP from 99/54 to105/57.

Discussion with his sister confirms the history and also adds
that he has had 3-4 months of leg cramps for which he has been
taking quinine.  She also states that she counted all his pills
at home and that these were accurate.

CTA:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Small amount of opacity at both lung bases representative of
either atelectasis or infiltrate.

ct a/p:
1) Dependent atelectasis/consolidation. This could represent
aspiration.
2) Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
3) Probable simple cyst in the kidney.
4) Periportal adenopathy.

ct spine:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of cervical spine fracture.

ct head w/o contrast:
1) No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2) Small vessel ischemic change.

cxr: Satisfactory positioning of the ET tube. No pneumothorax.
Patchy atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Pneumonia cannot be
excluded.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST, MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST, MRA
CAROTID/VERTEBRAL W/O CONTRAST:
1. No evidence of acute stroke.
2. Nonspecific hyperintensity in the periventricular white
matter most likely due to chronic small vessel infarction.
3. The MRA of the brain and neck are markedly limited by motion.
For further evaluation of the extracranial carotids, a carotid
ultrasound is recommended.

TTE:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2 Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
mild aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most
likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion
cannot be excluded.

MICRO:
negative urine, blood and csf cultures; ruled out for influenza
by negative direct antigens a and b. viral culture preliminarily
also negative.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo male w/ pmhx htn, hyperlipidemia, restless legs, bipolar
d/o found to have altered mental status and fever of unclear
etiologies, hypotension and mild pancreatitis, status post
extubation, having NSVT's while in ICU.

ICU course:
During ICU course, he defervesced, was extubated, weaned off
levophed, and antibiotics were discontinued. Workup for syncope,
seizure, stroke, meningeal or other infections negative to date.
TTE and viral cultures ordered and were pending. ICU course c/b
two episodes of asymptomatic NSVT.  Transferred to floor on
hospital day #3.

Overall Hospital course, by problem:
1. Altered Mental Status/Unresponsiveness: An extensive workup
was begun in the ICU.  Quinine was considered a possible
etiology as this can lead to prolonged QTc interval.  However,
he had a normal EKG and has no known history of cardiac disease.
He was ruled out for an MI.  His TTE showed only mild AS.
Infectious etiology was considered.  He had a lumbar puncture
with CSF showing normal protein and glucose and 1 WBC and 1 RBC.
 Blood, CSF, and urine cultures remained negative.  He was ruled
out for influenza by direct antigen testing and his viral
cultures were preliminarily negative.  Neurology was consulted.
A neurologic workup included a negative head MRI and MRA,
although the latter was limited by his motion.  His depakote
level was low, although per his VA psychiatrist, his level the
week before was 40s.  He had an EEG which was obtained while he
was on propofol that did not show lateralizing or epileptiform
abnormalities.  The propofol was turned off during EEG and there
was a slight increase in the background activity.  Neurology did
not believe that a seizure was responsible for his initial
state.  His tox screen was positive only for benzodiazepenes.
It is possible that a benzo overdose may have led to his altered
mental status although per his sister, all his pills are
accounted for at home.  A metabolic workup revealed initially
profound hypocalcemia and hypokalemia.  At TSH and free T4 were
normal; however his PTH was slightly elevated which is
consistent with a calcium deficiency. It is possible that
hypocalcemia was a cause of a neurologic disturbance or
undetected seizure as he appeared symptomatic from the
hypocalcemia with a reported history of muscle cramps.
Malabsorption and malnutrition were considered given his low
albumin.  However his calcium rose appropriately with
supplementation and his coagulation profile was normal.  He
