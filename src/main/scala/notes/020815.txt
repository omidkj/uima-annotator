Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
confusion, irritability

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year-old Female with a PMH significant for
dementia, prior CVA, history of deep venous thromboses,
rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension and non-healing lower
extremity wound brought in by her daughter for worsening
confusion and increased irritability.
.
In the ED, her daughter noted that her mother appeared more
irritable and confused over several days, and that she was
'making no sense'. She also noted right foot ulceration with
possible purulent drainage for 1-week (which appeared 4-weeks
prior).
.
Of note, the patient was recently evaluated in [**Hospital **]
clinic on [**2122-12-30**]. Per her daughter's report, she had been doing
well until [**2122-2-20**] when family members started noticing a
significant decline in her memory, as well as irritation,
agitation and paranoia. She was diagnosed with probable dementia
and started on BNZs along with Mirtazapine. She progressed to
being unable to care for herself and her daughter brought her to
live with her in [**Location (un) 86**] in [**2122-11-22**] (she had been in [**Country 532**]
prior to these). A work-up for reversible causes was reassuring,
vitamin B-12, folate, TSH were normal. Per the daughter, the
daughter reports a leave of absence from work given her mother's
full-time needs. She helps to care for her mother in terms of
all of her activities of daily living as well as making sure she
is safe at home, taking her medication, eating, not wandering
outside, etc. She reports that her mother has periods of waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] where her mental status will seem fairly good and
then be quite poor to the point she does not even recognize her
daughter.  She also has periods of irritation as well as
paranoia when she feels that people are stealing her belongings.
This information was obtained from Dr.[**Name (NI) 25674**] clinic noted.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 104.6 120 134/102 22 100% RA.
Laboratory studies revealed WBC 15.2, neutrophilia 89.9% without
bandemia. Creatinine 0.8. Lactate 2.6. U/A moderately positive.
A CXR showed no acute process or focal consolidation. She had
evidence of right foot ulceration and drainage and radiographs
showed no evidence of infection, just degnerative changes. She
was given IV Vancomycin 1 gram and Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV x 1
to empirically cover her infectious sources. She received
Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO x 1. She was resuscitated with 1L NS x
2 for presumed sepsis and transferred to the Medicine floor. VS
prior to transfer 100.8 116/65 97 19 100% RA.
.
On arrival to the floor, history was difficult to obtain given
her dementia. Daughter not present.
