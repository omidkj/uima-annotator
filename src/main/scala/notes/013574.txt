History of Present Illness:
82 yo female with hx of afib s/p ablation x2 on amiodarone and
coumadin, CAD, HTN, hyperthyroidism, chronic cough who presents
with cough and SOB. Pt was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 2953**] for
rapid afib suspectedly due to hyperthyroidism induced by
amiodarone toxicity. She was started on methimazole, prednisone
and metoprolol and completed 2 wks of methimazole but was
continued continued on a prednisone taper although increased
back to 15mg from 10mg due to climbing freeT4. She presented to
her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-13**] for increase in her baseline cough and change in
the quality of her sputum to thick and green but no fever or
chills. He held on antibiotics and obtained a CXR which revealed
blunted CP angles with interstitial prominence but no
infiltrate. This am she noticed irregular pulse so called her
endocrinologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7852**] who consulted with her cardiologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and told her to go to the ED. Her irregular pulses
lasted 2 hours and resolved spontaneously before getting to the
ED. She denied CP, CT, PND, orthopnea but did have increasing
DOE. She also reports for the last 2 wks some nocturia with
incontinence, but no frequency, urgency or dysuria during the
day.
In the ED, she was afebrile and VS were stable with CXR
revealing RML opacity so she was given 750mg of levofloxacin,
tessalon pearles and tylenol with codeine and admitted for PNA.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)  Respiratory Failure: Patient was admitted for suspected
pneumonia with positive rhinovirus by bronchoscopy BAL and
presumed bacterial superinfection.  This escalated to ARDS
requiring MICU admission and intubation.   She was treated with
steroids, fluconazole, cefepime/flagyl for a 10 day course.
Shortly after tapering steroids she developed increased
dependence on the ventilator and so steroids were increased.
She was shortly thereafter given a tracheostomy and PEG due to
inability to wean from vent.  Within the first few days she was
improving, able to breath at trach mask only for several hours
per day, however, over [**3-9**]-23 she had increased secretion
and difficulty weaning pressure support with increasing
leukocytosis.  On [**2160-3-10**] she was restarted on Vancomycin and
Cefepime for planned 10 day course.  Sputum has only ever grown
yeast.  As of [**2160-3-15**] she had increased secretions and underwent
another bronchoscopy. This confirmed that the trach was
mechnically intact.
    In review of her respiratory failure, the MICU team also
considered amiodarone toxicity, although seemed unlikely given
acute time frame. She had a bronchoscopy on [**2-19**], PCP was
negative but rhinovirus positive.
Patient was placed on assist-control at night for comfort while
sleeping, and pressure support during the day, and may continue
this at rehab.
.
2) Afib- tachy/brady symdrome:  Followed in house by patient's
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Through course pt had several episodes
of afib/aflutter with additional episodes of RVR with aberrancy.
 Best controlled on Metoprolol 25 mg po BID. Decision was made
to discontinue her amiodarone early in the hospital course as
this was causing hyperthyroidism which was exacerbating her
afib, aflutter. When on smaller doses of metoprolol, pt
developed tachycardia with hypotension and increased work of
breathing.  She had been on digoxin briefly but this was
discontinued in the setting of bradycardic episodes to the 30's.
 Prior to hospitalization she was on coumadin 1 mg po qd.
Patient with heart rate in the 40s intermittently, but remains
hemodynamically stable.
.
She has been maintained well on Metoprolol 25 mg Q6H. When she
does not take her Metoprolol, her heart rate goes into the range
of 130-140. When she is given metoprolol and she is resting, her
heart rate will suddenly decrease dramatically to 30's. She was
asymptomatic with a HR 30s.
.
3) Amiodarone induced secondary hyperthyroidism: Improved to
normal function on steroids.  Endocrine team suggests slow taper
of prednisone and she is currently at prednisone 15 mg po qd.
Goal dose is to get her off of steroids over the next 1-1.5
months. She will need [**Hospital1 **]-weekly TFTs and to follow up with her
outpatient endocrinologist by [**2160-4-13**].  Family can schedule
appointment.
.
4) Hyperglycemkia: Pt required sliding scale regular insulin
while on steroids.
.
5) GERD: cont protonix  and prm reglan
.
6)Tube feeds given through PEG tube.
.
7) Prophylaxis:  Pt does not need heparin SC while INR on
coumadin > 2.0.  She does require a proton pump inhibiotor.

.
8) Access: A PICC line was placed and confirmed by X ray on
[**2160-3-11**], this unfortunattely clotted off and a new PICC was
placed on the left side that is functional.
.
9) Code: Full code - should be re-discussed with patient at
rehab.
