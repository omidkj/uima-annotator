Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo F with PMH non-small cell lung cancer s/p LUL lobectomy in
[**3-/2173**] with radical LND plus intercostal flap patch and
pulmonary artery angioplasty, vocal cord paralysis [**12-24**]
intubation, HTN, depression, CREST syndrome transferred from OSH
for possible bronchial stent after several episodes of recurrent
PNA and hypoxia. Pt intubated at OSH. Cause of LLL bronchial
compression was uncertain but suspicion was that recurrent lung
cancer could be the cause. LUL stump had been bronched in past
and found to be necrotic. Plan was for CT scan and possible
[**Month/Day (2) **] in AM. However, several hours after admission pt began
hemorrhaging into ETT tubing (over a liter of frank blood in
minutes). She rapidly lost her blood pressure, desaturated, and
became pulseless. Code Blue was called and attempt was made to
resuscitate patient, but this was deemed futile after a short
time. At that time, she had no pulse, no respirations, pupils
were fixed and unresponsive to light, and there were no dolls
eyes. Time of death 0545. Death reported to ME who declined
autopsy. Family also declined autopsy.
