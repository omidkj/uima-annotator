Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, altered mental status
Intubated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2113-5-17**] Ventriculostomy placement
[**2113-5-18**] Cerebral Angiogram
[**2113-5-31**] Tracheostomy
[**2113-6-14**] PEG placement


History of Present Illness:
45yo male with history of IV drug use, endocarditis s/p MVR and
PPM placement, and hepatitis C admitted to OSH with altered
mental status.
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**5-4**] requesting
detoxification as he started using IV drugs again.  He had not
been compliant with his medications, including his coumadin.  He
was found to have a subclavian DVT and a left brachial arterial
aneurysm, which was thought to be secondary to injection of IV
drugs.  Vascular evaluated the patient and recommended the
patient be fully sober before any attempt at aneurysm repair.
He was placed on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin. He
had an elevated WBC there and was febrile so he was started in
azithromycin with improvement in both.  However, on [**5-8**], he
became agitated and left the hospital AMA.  He returned to the
ED on [**5-9**] and reported chest pain radiating to the left arm,
headache, photophobia (no rigidity) and shortness of breath.  He
reported using cocaine since his discharge and denied use of
EtOH.
.
While there, he was found to be febrile with increasing
shortness of breath.  TTE negative for vegetations and blood
culture with no growth at the time of transfer.  CXR with no
clear consolidation and he was scheduled to undergo a TEE to
rule out endocarditis but the patient started withdrawing right
before the procedure.  He was given suboxone.  Later on during
the hospitalization, he was found to have a dense aphasia and
left hemiplegia.  Neurology was consulted and felt this could be
secondary to meningitis vs embolic events.  CT scan demonstrated
poor definition of perimesencephalic cisterns without asymmetry
which was concerning for some increased intracranial pressure.
There was evidence of treated AVM with no other signs of acute
or evolving territorial infarct.  Patient was started on a
heparin gtt for presumed embolic event.
.
Given the concern for meningitis, he was also treated with
vancomycin, ceftriaxone and gentamycin.  His mental status
remained altered.  In addition, his respiratory status worsened
requiring intubation on evening [**5-16**].  CXR did not reveal a
clear consolidation and he had elevated A-a gradient so he
underwent a CTA which did not reveal a PE.   His mental status
did not improve and his respiratory status worsened.  He
continued on a heparin drip.  A CTA was negative for PE. He was
intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-17**] for further w/u.
.
On transfer to MICU [**Location (un) 2452**], vital signs were T- 98.2, BP-
127/76, HR- 62, RR- 23, SaO2- 96% (intubated).  Patient was
intubated and sedated.  On day of admission a new right eye
lateral deviation was noted on exam. Neurosurgery was urgently
consulted. An stat head CT/CTA was obtained that showed SAH and
likely PCA aneurysm.

Imaging:
CXR [**5-17**] - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2112-2-12**],
there is now an endotracheal tube in place, with the tip
approximately 6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is coiled
within the stomach. Pacemaker device remains in place.
Hyperlucency in the upper lungs is again seen consistent with
chronic pulmonary disease. There are some areas of increased
opacification in the bases bilaterally. Some of this most likely
reflects redistribution of blood flow related to the upper zone
emphysema. However, there may be some pulmonary vascular
congestion related to overhydration. In the appropriate clinical
setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia on one or both
sides would have to be considered.

CT abd/pelv [**5-17**] - IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to prior examination of [**2111-9-20**], there are new
infarcts in the
spleen, right kidney in the lower pole and left kidney in the
upper pole. A new exophytic lesion in the right lower pole is
too small to characterize and while this may represent a cyst,
this could also represent a developing abscess in this clinical
setting. If further differentiation is needed, this could be
performed with MRI.
2. Old infarcts in the spleen and right kidney are again noted.
3. Atelectasis in the lower lobes bilaterally

CTA head [**5-17**] - IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal
cisterns, bilateral sylvian fissures, and left parie
