Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
auto and allogeneic transplant with recurrence on monthly
chemotherapy admitted after he presented for scheduled
chemotherapy with fevers to 101 in clinic and transferred to the
ICU for persistent hypotension after bronchoscopy.
.
The patient initially presented to clinic on [**2103-9-27**] for
scheduled Gemzar, navelbine and decadron therapy. He was found
to have a fever to 101. On review of systems at that time the
patient did admit to feeling fatigued and generally unwell
possibly with a component of pleuritic chest pain and dry cough.
CXR at that time revealed an evolving RLL and lingular/LUL
infiltrate. He was admitted for further evaluation with CXR and
CT chest concerning for evolving pneumonia. The patient was
started on Vancomycin, Cefepime and Voriconazole. During his
hospital stay, the patient did have relative hypotension as at
baseline to the range of sbp 90's with tachycardia to the low
100's. The patient did have individual sbp measurements
overnight prior to transfer as low as 80's, reportedly fluid
responsive.
.
The patient was brought to the ICU for elective bronchoscopy.
During the procedure, the patient received 1mg midazolam and a
bolus of 25mcg of fentanyl. Post-procedure the patient was
persistently hypotensive to the range of sbp 78-82 with intact
mentation though some complaints of feeling tired and mildly
lightheaded. His hypotension was refractory to 1L of NS. The
patient was kept in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.
.
Of note, the patient has a history of multiple episodes of
pneumonia in the past most recently with fungal pnuemonia based
upon positive galactomannan in [**1-6**].
.
ROS: Denies any recent sick contacts. Notes mild pleuritic chest
pain and nausea. No emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, brbpr,
urinary complaints.

Past Medical History:
Past medical/surgical history:
Hodgkin's disease (see below)
Hypothyroidism
Asthma
s/p biliary stent (see below)
Hepatitis B core+
.
Oncologic history:
1. Diagnosed with stage IIB Hodgkin's lymphoma in 12/99,
completed ABVD for four cycles with the last 1 [**1-31**] cycles
without bleomycin due to pulmonary toxicity, followed by
consolidative mantle radiation therapy.
2. Relapsed in [**10-2**] treated with ICE x2 cycles, high-dose
Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization followed by CBV with
autologous stem cell transplant on [**2098-1-23**].
3. Relapsed in [**6-2**] treated with ESHAP x 1 cycle in preparation
for allo stem cell transplant, which he underwent on [**2098-8-7**]
from a sibling related donor with fludarabine and Cytoxan
conditioning. Transplant complicated by liver GVHD confirmed by
a biopsy on [**2099-1-11**] treated with prednisone. Also noted to be
hepatitis B core antibody positive at that time and began on
lamivudine to prevent reactivation.
4. Evidence for recurrent disease and status post a donor
lymphocyte infusion on [**2099-7-2**] with a second one on [**2099-9-9**].
5. Further progression of his disease in [**10-4**] and treated with
ESHAP x 2 cycles on [**2099-10-16**] and [**2099-11-17**].
6. Enrolled on the DC/DLI protocol and received these infusions
in mid [**1-3**] with progressive disease particularly in his lung
base.
7. Outpatient regimen of Rituxan and gemcitabine with
unfortunately progressive symptoms and then followed with two
more cycles of ESHAP in [**Month (only) 958**] and [**2100-4-30**] with an
excellent response to therapy.
8. Enrolled on an experimental protocol at the [**Company 2860**] involving
anti-CTLA-4 antibody with donor lymphocyte infusions support
with relatively stable disease.
9. Further progression of his disease over several months with
particularly increasing abdominal involvement and treated with
another cycle of ESHAP in [**4-5**].
10. Treated with CEP chemotherapy on [**2101-6-8**] with a donor
lymphocyte infusion on [**2101-6-29**] at 1 x 108 T cells per kilogram
with marked GVHD of the liver with increased transaminases and
bilirubin requiring CellCept and prednisone with eventual
resolution.
11. Following discontinuation of his immune suppression and no
further GVHD, noted for further progression of his disease, he
was treated with CEP chemotherapy on [**2101-12-19**], [**2102-1-31**], and
[**2102-3-6**] with a response to treatment. Also requiring periodic
thoracenteses of now recurrent pleural effusions.
12. Status post DLI on [**2102-3-29**] at a dose of 1 x 10(8) T cells
per kilogram.
13. Presented in [**6-6**] with increased liver function tests and
bilirubin with infiltration of the pancreatic head with
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. He had a biliary stent
placed. This was changed in [**9-6**].
14. Treated with Day 1,2,3 only of CEP starting on [**2102-6-30**] with
evidence for disease response on CT scan from [**2102-7-21**].
15. Rescanned in [**9-6**] with progression of disease and then
received two more cycles of CEP on [**2102-9-7**] and [**2102-10-10**] with CT
scan on [**2102-11-8**] with response to therapy.
16. Consideration of another DLI, but developed progression of
disease with recurrent hydronephrosis. Treated with another
cycle of CEP on [**2102-11-24**]. D8 held due to low counts. During
this admission, also had thoracentesis for pleural effusions.
17. Planned evaluation for H-DAC inhibitors at [**Company 2860**].

CT Chest:
1. Overall improving patchy ground-glass opacities within the
lungs
bilaterally. Slight increased opacities involving anterior right
upper and
right middle lobes. Findings again suggestive of infection.
2. Unchanged mediastinal mass.
3. Slight decrease in size of right lower lobe mass.
4. Slight decrease in size of incompletely evaluated
retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.
5. Tiny perihepatic ascites.

1. Overall, stable retroperitoneal disease burden.
2. Slight improvement in some regions of consolidation within
the lungs,
although there is increased ground-glass opacity seen in the
upper lobe of
both the right and left lungs. This may be secondary in part to
