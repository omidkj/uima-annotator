History of Present Illness:
67 yo male w/ MDS with recent admission from [**Date range (1) 73061**] to
surgical service for R. hemicolectomy with end ileostomoy and
mucous fistula admitted on [**2134-10-14**] with SIRS/early sepsis with
unknown source of infection.
.
Admission [**Date range (1) 73061**] was for evaluation for bilateral
erythema/blisters on arms after injections/ treatment with IM
vidaza for his MDS on [**9-20**]. His hospital course was
complicated by necrotic bowel and an exp lap was performed with
hemicolectomy and end ileostomy and mucous fistula ([**2134-9-28**]).
He required intubation for respiratory distress and
cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.  Also developed VRE
(sensitive to daptomycin) in peritoneal fluid, discharged on
daptomycin.
.
ER visits [**10-12**] and [**10-13**]: Presented with concern of infected
wound dehisence, evalutated by surgery, discharged with bactrim
and keflex for presumed wound infection and concomittant UTI.
Represented the following day with hypotension, fever, Hct of 21
and INR of 8. Received total 6 Units PRBC, 1 unit FFP and IVF,
vitK.  Rt IJ placed, started on Dapto/Zosyn.
.
SICU admission [**10-14**]: Presentation notable for skin lesion,
fever, hypotension, HCT drop, and elevated INR. He was continued
on daptomycin and pip-tazo. The patient has had volume
responsive hypotension with no current pressor requirement. He
underwent U/S-guided paracentesis w/ removal of 2700cc. He was
found to have erythema surrounding his abd incision with an
additional erythematous nodule on the R thigh. The etiology of
the patient's presentation has been unclear, however possible
infectious sources include a secondary wound infection vs.
hematogenous spread of an alternate underlying infection. The
patient's skin findings are felt to be more consistent with
inflammatory etiology (as opposed to infectious etiology).
Prelim biopsy for hip and peri-incisional biopsies read as
neutrophilic dermatosis (pyoderma gangrenosum), though cannout
rule out infectious process.
.
Upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] patient reports intermittent abdominal
pain mid-abdomen fluctuating in intensity [**2134-4-24**], no radiation.
Occasional nausea, no vomitting.  Ostomy output loose and brown.

.
CXR [**2134-10-13**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions. Equivocal signs
for mild
pulmonary vascular congestion. Otherwise, unremarkable.
.
CT Abdomen [**2134-10-13**]: 1. Large volume ascites with mild
peritoneal enhancement in the right paracolic gutter. Overall
appearance appears simple though given history of recent
surgery, peritonitis cannot be excluded. Consider paracentesis
with culture.
2. Post operative changes rel;ated to recent bowel resection
without evidence of bower obstruction or perforation.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe
compressive
atelectasis.
.
Right hip skin biopsy [**2134-10-14**]: The findings in both specimens
are similar, with intense neutrophilic infiltration of the
dermis.  The overlying epidermis exhibits neutrophilic
spongiosis with foci of spongiform pustulation; in specimen 2,
frank cleavage is noted through the spinous layer.  No
micro-organisms are identified within the inflamed tissue in
PAS, GMS, and Gram stained sections
.
Paracentesis:  Technically successful diagnostic and therapeutic
paracentesis yielding 2.7 liters of amber clear ascitic fluid,
which was sent for microbiology and cell count.
