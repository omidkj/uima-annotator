breath associated with a nonproductive cough. Denies any fever,
chills, myalgias, rhinorrhea. She presented to her PCP
approximately one week ago at the onset of her symptoms, and was
started on azithromycin for a 5 day course. Due to persistence
of her symptoms, she was given PO prednisone (unknown dose) and
bactrim 2 days ago without significant improvement in her
symptoms. She has also tried using her home oxygen without
significant improvement in her symptoms.

Endorses some left sided discomfort under her ribs, which she
attributes to mucous that is not being expectorated. Denies any
chest pain, PND, pleuritic chest pain. At baseline, can walk

IMAGING:
CXR: [**2180-7-24**]
Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The
lungs are relatively hyperinflated, with flattening of the
diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. No focal consolidation, pleural
effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in
size. Diffuse osteopenia is seen.

CXR: [**2180-7-25**]
New and increased bibasilar opacification is probably
atelectasis but could be due to recent aspiration. Generalized
hyperinflation indicates substantial emphysema and makes the
moderately enlarged heart looks smaller than it actually is. No
good evidence for pneumonia, as yet, or pleural abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. COPD exacerbation: Initially presented with increased dyspnea
and cough with significant hypoxia, wheezing and hyperinflated
CXR on exam.  Failed outpatient regimen of PO steriods and
repeat antibiotic course.  Trigger of exacerbation  most likely
viral syndrome, with no fever, leukocytosis, or evidence of
pneumonia.  BNP within normal limits and no evidence of volume
overload/ CHF on exam.  With sinus tachycardia, PE was
considered in the initial diagnosis but absence of right heart
strain on EKG and rapid improvement with threatment, argued
against this diagnosis.
On presentation to the emergency department, patient had high
oxygen requirements, requiring 100% nonrebreather, but this was
able to be rapidly down-titrated to 4L nasal cannula.  Treated
with nebulizers ATC, steriods (initially received 125mg
methylprednisolone and then transitioned to PO taper), and
levofloxacin.  As above, patient rapidly improved and was able
to maintain resting saturations of 90-95% on room air.
Discharged with instructions to continue 14 day prednisone
taper, combivent inhalers, advair, and home oxygen as needed.
Of note, patient was medically advised against air travel within
the next week/ until respiratory status significantly improves.
Although the hypoxia of increased elevation may not be
problem[**Name (NI) 115**] with supplemental oxygen, bronchospasm may cause
emergent respiratory distress.

2. Sinus Tachycardia: Upon admission, patient with sinus
tachycardia in the low 100s, surging to 120 with use of
albuterol nebulizers in the emergency room.  Tachycardia thought
to be an appropriate response to hypoxia and inhaled B-agonist.
Heart rate returned to [**Location 213**] range with clinical improvement.
