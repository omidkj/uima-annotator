Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure, acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
dialysis catheter placed for CVVH

History of Present Illness:
83M with hx of sCHF (EF 40%), CKI (baseline CR ~2 at
presentation at OSH), former smoker with 30 pack year history,
presents from an OSH with hypoxemic respiratory failure and
acute kidney injury.
.
The patient originally presented on [**2138-12-22**] to OSH with 3 weeks
of hemoptysis associated with intercurrent wheezing, weight
loss, and dyspnea.  Symptoms were not responsive to antibiotics
or low dose steroid therapy.  8 pound weight loss in past month
also noted, with chills.  Per the patient's son, Mr. [**Known lastname 110710**] has
had a dry cough for about a year, and is bothered by chronic
lower extremity claudication.  A chest film on [**2138-12-22**] showed
diffuse, primarily lower [**Date Range 3630**] interstitial infiltrates without
pleural effusions, with upper lung zone hyperlucency.  A CT
chest on [**2138-12-22**] showed diffuse bilateral interstitial,
primarily ground-glass appearing interstitial infiltrates;
bronchiectatic changes were also noted.  Pleura was focally,
intermittently thickened.  Small right pleural effusion was
noted.  No lymphadenopathy was noted.
.
He presented for outpatient bronchoscopy on [**2139-1-5**], with BAL
of lingula and transbronchial biopsy of the right middle [**Date Range 3630**].
His vitals on presentation were 97.9 F, HR 69, RR 26, 170/75, O2
sat 87% on room air.  Post-procedure, his oxygenation declined,
requiring 6 liters N/C and then a NRB to maintain sats in the
high 80s.  A post-procedure radiograph showed development of
dense infiltrate in the RML.  Oxygenation remained poor, the
patient became tachypneic, and was admitted.  100% O2 on a NRB
did not improve O2 sats, and the patient was intubated for
hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
While at the OSH the pathology from the trans bronichial biopsy
was sent to another OSH, which was intepreted as consistent with
BOOP.  Serologic [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, RF negative.  In the ICU, an a-line
and left subclavian were placed.  Mild transaminitis resolved in
days.  The patient subsequently received solumederol 0.5gm for a
number of days, which did not improve bilateral infiltrates.  He
developed Azotemia with BUN of 200. The patient subsequently
underwent repeat CT scan that revealed evidence of large
bilateral effusions with worsening infiltrates. Vent settings
prior to transfer AC 550 x 25 10 PEEP 40% Fi02. Pt with
Klebsiella in sputum, has remained afebrile.  Steroids were
tapered in setting of azotemia.  Diuresis was then attempted in
setting of systolic CHF, EF 40%.  [**Last Name (LF) 110711**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] block [**2-10**]
beta-blockade, coag (-) staph from a-line (since discontinued)
was also noted during his course.
.
BAL results at OSH:  Path specimen was sent to [**Hospital1 2025**], interpreted
as having characteristic features of BOOP with branching [**Hospital1 **]
of fibrous tissue surrounded by organizing alveolar inflammation
and scattered eosinophils.

differential:  32 lymph, 63 polys, numerous RBCs
.
While in transit the patients vent settings were adjusted to TV
500. T time increased from 0.6 to 1. He was paralyzed with
Rocuronium 63mg then 100mg. He received a total of 4mg of Ativan
and 150mcg of Fenantyl.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient is intubated, sedated and
paralyzed. Unable to assess futher review of systems.
Additional history provided by son noted above.  No recent
history of n/v/d/f or PND/orthopnea.

Portable chest film:  No previous images. The endotracheal tube
tip lies approximately 4 cm above the carina. Right PICC line
terminates near the origin of the SVC.  There is enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette with prominence of pulmonary vessels
consistent with vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacification
is consistent with atelectasis and probable effusion. There are
some patchy areas of opacification bilaterally that could
represent superimposed pneumonia. Nasogastric tube extends to
the stomach.

CT chest without contrast:
1. Left ventricular enlargement, moderate pulmonary edema,
moderate
nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusions, could be related to
severe
coronary atherosclerosis and some aortic valvular stenosis.
2. Small right middle [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] hematoma.
3. Moderate emphysema.
4. Severe atherosclerosis involving coronaries, proximal head
and neck and
abdominal arteries. No aneurysm.
5. Large exophytic right renal cyst.
6. Anemia.

TTE [**2139-1-22**]:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35%). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
moderate global LV hypokinesis. Mild mitral
