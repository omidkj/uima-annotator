Chief Complaint:
mitral regurgitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2166-6-3**] Mitral Valve Replacement (33mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical)


History of Present Illness:
This 37 year old man witha history of rheumatic heart disease
has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**].  He immigrated to this country
a few years ago and has been an active soccer player until about
six months ago, when he could no longer play a full game because
of shortness of breath. In [**2156-3-14**], his primary care
physician auscultated [**Name Initial (PRE) **] murmur following complaints of worsening
shortness of breath. Subsequent echocardiogram demonstrated
severe polyvalvular rheumatic disease with dominant lesions of
mixed mitral regurgitation and stenosis. Echocardiogram also
notable for a dilated and slightly hypokinetic right ventricle
with at least moderate, if not severe pulmonary hypertension and
right ventricular pressure overload. Given the above findings,
he was referred for possible mitral valve replacement surgery.

Preoperative work up was previously completed and he was
admitted now for same day surgery.

TEE
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate- severe
valvular mitral stenosis (area <1.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS
There is a well seated, well functioning bileaflet mechanical
prosthesis in the mitral position. Valvular MR is present which
is normal in quantity and location for this type of prosthesis
(washing jets). The LV now appears more depressed (LVEF~ 35%).
RV systolic function appears normal. The AI has increased but is
still trace in quantity. The study is otherwise unchanged from
prebypass

Brief Hospital Course:
  He was taken to the operating room on [**2166-6-3**] where he
underwent a mitral valve replacement with a 33-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve.  See operative note for full details.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
CVICU in stable condition with no pressor requirement. He
extubated on the post operative night without incident.

He was started on Coumadin for his mechanical valve and
anticoagulated with a goal INR 2.5-3.5.  On post operative day 1
chest tubes were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  He was
started on low dose Lopressor.  He was gently diuresed with
Lasix to his preoperative weight.  He was transferred to the
step down unit in stable condition.

Lopressor was discontinued as his blood pressure was intolerant
of even 6.25 mg twice daily. He remained in sinus rhythm. He
continued to progress well and was seen for Physical Therapy for
 strength and mobility.  He was ambulating without difficulty,
tolerating a regular diet, and his incisions were healing well
and his INR was therapuetic (2.9) on Coumadin on [**6-8**] when he
was discharged home.

Arrangements were made for follow up with his providers and the
VNA. Coumadin will be managed by his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
