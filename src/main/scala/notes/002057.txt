Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 105**] for acute on chronic respiratory
distress.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture on [**8-22**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19641**] is a 73 yo male with a complicated past medical
history, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-8**] following a
prolonged admission for STEMI, respiratory failure felt
secondary to pulmonary edema requiring intubation and subsequent
tracheostomy [**2-28**] failure to wean, sepsis and C.difficile colitis
treated with Vancomycin and Flagyl with a course of Levophed. He
was discharged to [**Hospital3 105**] for continued weaning. Per
[**Hospital3 **], patient remained ventilator dependent,
intermittently on PS 20/5 and back on AC 15/5/500/0.35 on [**8-14**].
At OSH, sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and MRSA, and he was
restarted on Zosyn ([**8-14**]) and Vancomycin ([**8-15**]). He completed
his course of Vancomycin on [**2159-8-16**].

However, today around 17:45, while being moved by the nursing
staff, Mr. [**Known lastname 19641**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4351**] started coughing. Suctioned X 1,
mucus not cleared. He then became dusky and cyanotic, and
stopped breathing on his own. A code was called, + pulse.
Patient placed on FiO2 100%. Vitals [**Last Name (Titles) 4351**] HR 88-98, BP
150/80. ABG done on FiO2 100% 7.36/66/417/98%. At [**Hospital1 **], BP
dropped to 90, and patient was started on NS IVF, with
improvement in BP. EKG without acute changes. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management on AC, RR 15, PEEP 5, Vt 500,
Fi02 1.0.

In ED, BP 80/60, HR 80. Continued on IVF (received total
2300cc), with improved BP to SBP 105-118. Stool sent for C.diff
and given Flagyl 500 mg PO X 1 dose.

Past Medical History:
1. Non-small cell lung cancer s/p XRT and chemotherapy in
[**Country 532**], s/p right pneumonectomy in [**9-/2158**] for recurrence.
Chronic left pleural effusion.
2. SSS status post PM/ICD placement
3. COPD/bronchiectasis
4. Hypertension
5. CAD, with known TO RCA.
6. CHF with EF 25% on last echo on [**2159-7-25**]
7. BPH
8. Depression
9. Left femoral AV fistula [**2159-4-25**]
10. Recent MRSA pneumonia and sepsis [**7-/2159**], treated with
Vancomycin
11. C. difficile colitis treated with Flagyl (completed [**8-16**])
12. Status post PEG tube placement [**7-/2159**]
13. Status post tracheostomy [**7-/2159**] [**2-28**] failure to wean
14. Status post partial colectomy [**2126**]

Social History:
Son is next of [**Doctor First Name **]. See below for contact information. [**Name2 (NI) **] has
been living at [**Hospital1 **] House since [**2159-8-8**]. Per [**Hospital1 **], at
baseline, patient not interactive. Opens eyes spontaneously,
withdraws to painful stimulus.

****************
IMAGING: [**2159-8-20**] CXR: ETT in correct position. PM wires in good
position. S/p right pneumonectomy. Blunting of left CPA likely
effusion. New lower left lateral CW opacity, likely loculated
pleural fluid.

[**2159-7-25**] ECHO: Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum. LVEF 25%. Resting WMA include mid to distal septal
akinesis, apical akinesis, inferior akinesis/hypokinesis, and
mid to distal anterolateral hypokinesis/akinesis. No definite
apical thrombus seen (cannot exclude). [**1-28**]+ AR. Trivial MR. 1+
TR.

[**2159-8-22**] CT head: New rounded low-density area measuring 2.5 cm
in left basal ganglia, which partially extends to the left
thalamus, probably representing subacute infarction. On this
head CT without contrast, the evaluation is limited.

[**2159-8-22**] CTA chest: No evidence for pulmonary embolism. Findings
consistent with failure or fluid overload. Development of small
loculated pleural fluid collection along the periphery of the
left major fissure or so-called pseudotumor, consistent with the
recent chest x-ray. Unchanged appearance of right pneumonectomy.

[**2159-8-22**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Overall LVEF
is difficult to assess due to poor echo windows although the
basal LV appeas hyperdynamic without regional contraction
abnormality (suspect significant improvement compared to prior
study dated [**2159-7-24**]). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle (due to poor echo windows cannot fully exclude). The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade

[**2159-8-23**] EEG: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the voltage
suppression over the left hemisphere and due to the bursts of
generalized slowing and right hemisphere slowing. The first
abnormality raises the possibility of material (such as subdural
fluid) interposed between the brain and recording electrodes or
widespread cortical dysfunction on that side. Anatomic
correlation would be of interest if clinically indicated. The
generalized slowing indicates a non specific dysfunction in
midline structures. There was also evidence of subcortical
dysfunction on the right side. No epileptiform features were
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19641**] was admitted with respiratory failure, thought to
be related to mucus plugging as well as a pseudomonal pneumonia.
 Both of these etiologies were treated, and he continued to
oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings.
However, the issue that dominated the admission was his recent
acute decline in mental status.  He was thoroughly evaluated by
neurology and underwent head CT, MRI, LP, and EEG.  This work-up
demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct, likely
cardioembolic.  However, they felt this event could not account
for his new, severe global deficit; this was thought to be
secondary to a more pervasive process, likely anoxic
encephalopathy, for which the prognosis is extremely grim.  This
was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the
patient's wife, son, primary care doctor, ICU attending, and
neurology c
