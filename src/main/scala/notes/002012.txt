CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath/respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 18920**] is a 74-year-old
woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, end-state, on home oxygen with a FEV1 of 35%, and
multiple previous admissions over the past several months for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flares with pneumonia;
initially admitted with a cough and increasing respiratory
distress at home.  She was initially treated with antibiotics
and prednisone and found to be in increasing respiratory
distress and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for trial support of BiPAP.  However, the patient declined
BiPAP in the unit stating that she no longer wished to
prolong her life.  She was lucid, alert, and rational per the
Medical Intensive Care Unit at this point, and per her
family.

At this point the goals for the patient's care were changed
to maximization of comfort.  The decision was made to return
the patient to the floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Significant for)
1.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, oxygen
dependent with multiple flares in the past several months.
2.  Chronic pneumonias.
3.  Osteoporosis.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5.  Anxiety.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on arrival to the
floor were Colace, Serevent, Flovent, levofloxacin, heparin,
Protonix, Combivent, and morphine drip.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs were
satting at 90% to 97% on 6 liters nasal cannula with a
temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 90, a blood pressure of
130/70.  In general, in no acute distress at this time,
although thin and tired-appearing.  Heart rate and rhythm
were regular, with a normal first heart sound and second
heart sound.  Her lungs were significant for having slight
wheezing, bilateral crackles at the bases, and very poor air
movement.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
She had trace edema in the lower extremities.
Neurologically, she was alert and oriented and appropriate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   After being transferred to the floor the
patient's entire family arrived and a discussion regarding
her prognosis and the appropriate course to be taken was
made.  The patient's wishes were explicit that she wished to
be comfort measures only and did not wish to continue.  The
family agreed with this, and the decision was made at this
time to withdraw all care with the exception of comfort
medications including a morphine drip and oxygen by nasal
cannula.

After discontinuation of the albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers and her steroids, her pulmonary status rapidly
declined.  She was kept comfortable on a morphine drip with
boluses as needed.  Her family remained with her throughout
the stay.  After approximately 48 hours, the patient passed
away comfortably.  At this time the family declined a
postmortem examination.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Pneumonia.
