Pertinent Results:
MICRO:
C.diff [**8-28**]: positive
Urine [**8-31**] +E.coli >10^5
.
IMAGING:
EKG [**2104-8-25**]: NSR at 72 bpm, nl axis, early R wave progression, Q
in III, compared to EKG dated [**2099-12-28**], precordial TWI
resolved.
.
EKG [**2104-9-1**] 11:35 am: NSR at 78, NANI, I and aVL with new 1mm ST
depressions; II with new TWF, III and aVF with 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**]
elevations and new TWF/TWI and deeper Q waves, V2 with [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions, diffuse precordial T wave flattening.
.
EKG [**2104-9-1**] 3:49 pm: NSR with mult PACs, limb lead ST changes
resolved, still with inferior TWF/TWI, V2 with 2mm ST
depressions, diffuse precordial T wave flattening unchanged.
.
CT Head [**8-25**]: No ICH or fracture.
.
CT C Spine [**8-25**]: Study is limited by patient motion. No definite
fracture. Grade 1 anterolisthesis at the C3-4 level is likely
degenerative but clinical correlation is recommended.
.
CXR [**8-25**]: Mild prominence of pulm vasculature. Small Pericardial
Effusion.
.
CXR [**2104-9-1**]: In comparison with the study of [**8-31**], there are
even lower lung volumes with bilateral atelectatic changes,
especially at the left base. The area behind the heart is
difficult to evaluate and the possibility of pneumonia in this
region cannot be excluded in the absence of a lateral view.
.
XRay Hip [**8-25**]: displaced R femoral neck fracure.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 88 yo F with Alzheimer's dementia p/w a fall resulting in a
hip fx, s/p hemiathroplasty, complicated by C. diff infection.
She was transferred to MICU w/ hypoxic respiratory failure 2' to
evolving MI, CHF, and pulmonary edema. Poor prognosis and level
of consciousness. She was made CMO per family meeting on [**2104-9-2**],
and passed away on while on the medicine floor on [**2104-9-5**].
.
# R hip fracture: associated w/ fall at rehab. s/p R hip
arthroplasty. Unable to assess pain due to decreased mental
status. Morphine PO was given for pain and continued with code
status was made CMO.
.
# Acute myocardial infarction. Pt suffered an MI that was likely
the cause of her tachypnea. She ruled in with positive troponin
and MBI; she had ECG changes (ST elevation in III and aVF). She
had a peak Troponin of 1.01  She was managed medically w/
Lovenox, plavix, B-[**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]. All of her medications were
d/c-ed with her code status change to CMO.
.
# Tachypnea/Volume Overload/Pulmonary Edema. Likely related to
acute MI, leading to CHF and pulmonary edema. Pt was oxygenating
and ventilating well in the MICU, but had very poor mental
status. She did have a significant non-gap metabolic acidosis,
could be contributing as source of increased ventilation.  She
was managed for her MI as above. Her acidosis was corrected by
lactated ringers and free water boluses 400cc q4h to reduce
hypercholemic acidosis. She was also treated w/ gentle diuresis.
With her changed to CMO status, her diuresis was stopped. The
patient was placed on morphine PO.
.
# C.diff colitis: Likely related to peri-operative antibiotics.
She was started PO vancomycin due to her worsening mental
status. With the change in her CMO status, the antibiotic was
stopped.
.
# Depressed mental status/decreased responsiveness: Pt had
dementia with subacute delerium. Over her hospital stay, she
became less responsive. She waxed and waned in her mental
status, which was likely delerium related to her MI and
infection. With her multiple medical problems and her
progressing non-responsive mental status, her prognosis was
deemed extremely poor. A family meeting was held, code status
was changed to CMO.  She was given Morphine and Zydis PRN for
agitation.
.
# Leukocytosis. Likely related to significant C.diff, plus UTI,
plus possible MI. Worsened despite C.diff treatment. D/C-ed
antibiotics with change in code status.
.
# UTI. E.coli related. No antibiotics w/ change in code status
to CMO.
.
# Hypernatremia. Likely due to intravascular volume depletion
and diuresis.  She received free water via NGT 400ml q4h, with a
calculated free water deficit to 1.5 L.  With her CMO status,
her labs were d/c-ed and she stopped receiving water through her
NGT.
.
# Dementia. Advanced. Held antipsychotics given depressed mental
status and change in CMO status.
.
# Atrial fibrillation. Irregularly irregular on floor during
exam, reverted to sinus w/ PACs. Nursing reports brief episodes
of tachycardia to 160s.  With her CMO status, her tele and vital
signs were d/c-ed.
.
# Depression: CMO as abov
