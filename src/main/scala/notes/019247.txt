Admission Date:  [**2158-4-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2158-4-22**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year old woman who
woke up feeling very weak with right arm substernal chest
pain at rest which was greater than before, and she said she
was experiencing some dyspnea on exertion.  She was recently
transfused two units of packed red blood cells on Friday.
Her primary care physician did routine blood work on Thursday
prior to admission with a hematocrit of 22.  Emergency
medical services took the patient the morning of admission
with substernal chest pain to [**Hospital3 **],
electrocardiogram with ST elevations and she was transferred
to [**Hospital6 256**] for catheterization.
Catheterization done revealed two vessel coronary artery
disease, left circumflex was totally occluded in the mid
segment but with collaterals to the right coronary artery.
Right coronary artery with severe mid disease, occluded in
the more distal segment.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty stent of the tortuous mid left circumflex/obtuse
marginal 1.  Right heart catheterization showed a mean RA of
7, PA systolic of 46, mean wedge pressure of 28, cardiac
output of 5.14.  Transferred to the CCU for further
monitoring.  Overall better post catheterization.  With the
exception of generalized weakness and chronic cough since
[**Month (only) 1096**].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notes a 10 pound weight loss over the
last few months and dyspnea on exertion, weakness and
fatigue.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Angina.
2.  Slight stroke, resulting in temporary left Bell's palsy.

colonoscopy except for benign polyps, negative small bowel
follow-through, negative barium enema, negative small bowel
biopsy for sprue, per primary care physician.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature was 95.6,
blood pressure 107/43, pulse 95, respiratory rate 22,
saturations 99% on room air.  Weight 81.6 kg.  In general a
pleasant elderly woman in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Moist mucous membranes, clear
oropharynx.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Neck
was supple.  Jugulovenous distension at 10 cm.  No carotid
bruit.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1
and S2, II/VI apical systolic murmur.  Lungs clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen, soft, nontender, positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities, 1+ lower extremity edema, right
groin site dressing was clean, dry and intact.  Skin with no
rashes or lesions.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed white
count 16.7 with 82% neutrophils, 2% bands, 7% lymphocytes.
Hematocrit 34.8, platelets 421.  Sodium 139, potassium 2.9,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1, glucose
217.  INR 1.3, albumin 4.5, creatinine kinase 68, troponin
0.02.  Electrocardiogram with normal sinus rhythm, normal
intervals, normal axis, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in 1, 2, V5, V6,
ST depressions in V2 and V3.  QRS of 130.  Catheterization as
above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 81 year old woman with
hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presented with ST elevation
myocardial infarction.  She came from catheterization with
chronically occluded right coronary artery and obtuse
marginal 1 status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty stenting of the occluded obtuse marginal 1.
Hemodynamics on catheterization showed increased wedge
pressure.

1.  ST elevation myocardial infarction - The patient with an
inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction with CK peaked in
the 1200 the morning after cardiac catheterization.
Otherwise the patient will remain stable and was started on
Aspirin and Plavix and was also started on a low dose beta
blocker which was eventually changed to Toprol XL regimen.
Initially the patient had nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia on telemetry but this resolved within 24 hours
after catheterization and repletion of her potassium.
Otherwise the patient had an echocardiogram done for follow
up which showed 30 to 35% ejection fraction, posterior
lateral akinesis and 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.  The
patient was started on ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction
and this was titrated up to a once a day Zestril regimen and
again the patient was titrated up on a beta blocker and
eventually switched to Toprol XL regimen.  The patient had
lipid panel sent and liver function tests sent which were
normal and the patient was started on 80 q. day of
Atorvastatin.

2.  Chronic cough - The patient was noted to have a chronic
cough in the past since [**Month (only) 1096**].  The patient was otherwise
stable except for asymptomatic.  The patient had a chest
x-ray which was normal.  The patient had a follow up
computerized tomography scan which results are still pending
at the time of this discharge summary, but this can be
followed up.  The patient had one episode of blood-tinged
sputum which was likely described as a coughing exacerbation.
Secondary to increase in cough started on Guaifenesin for
symptomatic relief.

3.  Anemia - The patient with known anemia and chronic guaiac
positive stools, gastrointestinal workup as an outpatient.
Next step will be endoscopy which she can have with an
outpatient gastroenterologist.  The patient was transfused a
total of 2 units of packed red blood cells during her stay.
The patient also had one atypical blast cell on her complete
blood count the morning after cardiac catheterization and
myocardial infarction.  The patient had follow up
differentials which did not show any further atypical cells.
The patient was seen by the Hematology Service and this can
be continued to be followed as an outpatient, but as she had
no further episodes, was attributed to acute inflammatory
state after her myocardial infarction.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Inferior myocardial infarction.
2.  Decreased ejection fraction.
3.  Increased fluid overload.
4.  Anemia.
5.  Chronic cough.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 p.o. q. day.
2.  Plavix 75 p.o. q. day.
3.  Atorvastatin 80 p.o. q. day.
4.  Lansoprazole.
5.  Toprol XL 25 p.o. q. day.
6.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day.
9.  Guaifenesin 5 to 10 ml p.o. q. 4-6 hours prn.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with her primary care
physician in seven to ten days.  The patient is to follow up
with her cardiologist in one to two weeks.  The patient is to
continue with physical therapy as directed.
