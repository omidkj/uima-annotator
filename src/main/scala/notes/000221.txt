HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 24-year-old male
helmeted motorcyclist who sustained injury on [**2197-12-8**] with
positive loss of consciousness at the scene.  He was alert
and oriented times three upon transfer via [**Location (un) **] to the
[**Hospital1 69**].  His only complaints
were decreased sensation of the lower extremities and some
shoulder pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination, upon arrival to the
Emergency department at [**Hospital1 69**]
was as follows:  GENERAL:  The patient was alert and oriented
times three.  The [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale was 15.  HEENT:  Pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Pupils were
4-mm  to 2 -mm with brisk reflex.  Extraocular muscles were
intact.  There was no JVD.  Trachea was midline.
RESPIRATORY:  Lungs were clear to auscultation.  Breath
sounds were equal bilaterally.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate
and rhythm, normal sinus at 55.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops
appreciated.  Pelvis was stable with no deformities and no
abrasions noted.  ABDOMEN:  Flat, soft, nontender and
nondistended.  Bowel sounds were present.  EXTREMITIES:
Bilateral shoulder pain, no obvious deformities noted.  He
was moving his upper extremities.  There was some movement
noted of the left lower extremity.  RECTAL:  Rectal tone
revealed good rectal tone and he was guaiac negative in the
Trauma Bay.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data upon admission revealed the
following:  White count of 8.8, hematocrit 44.8, platelet
count 259, PT 13, PTT 28.8, INR 1.2.  Chem 7 revealed the
sodium of 139, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 102, BUN 14,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 102.  Amylase was found to be 76.
Toxicology screen was negative.  Alcohol screen was negative.
Initial studies revealed the CAT scan of the head, which was
read as negative, with no findings, no evidence of bleed.
CAT scan of the neck was also read as negative.  There was no
evidence of deformity or fractures.  CAT scan of the thoracic
region, however, revealed that he was noted to have a T5, T6,
and T7 vertebral body fracture.  These were thought to be
pressure injuries and they were found to be bony fragments,
compressing on the spinal cord.  From the CAT scan, he was
taken to the Intensive Care Unit.  Hospital course from the
Intensive Care Unit was as follows:

On [**2197-12-10**], at about 2300 hours he developed hypoxia,
requiring intubation.  A chest x-ray and repeat CAT scan
revealed increasing severe pulmonary contusions in the
beginning development of ARDS.  He was intubated without
incident and placed on a ventilator.  At that time he was
paralyzed and sedated using propofol.

On [**2197-12-12**] he was started on total parenteral nutrition.  He
also had an IVC filter placed because it was felt that he was
at risk for increased deep vein thrombosis and possible
resulting pulmonary embolism.  He also was felt to have a
left pneumothorax.  This was found with decreasing oxygen
saturations, increasing respiratory difficulty and a chest
tube was placed on the left side without incident.

On [**2197-12-16**], cultures from the sputum, which were sent on
[**2197-12-13**] grew out Moraxella and Staphylococcus aureus.  At
this time Vancomycin was added to his regimen, pending
further speciation of the cultures.  He continued to be
sedated and intubated throughout this time.  The medications
being used were Ativan and Dilaudid drips.  On [**2197-12-17**], the
final cultures were speciated and found to be Moraxella and
methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  Vancomycin was
subsequently changed to Oxacillin.

On [**2197-12-19**], there was worsening of the pleural effusions
and he continued to be spiking increased temperatures.   He
continued to have broad antibiotic coverage.  The increasing
temperatures were thought to be due to the worsening
pneumonia.  Also, on [**2197-12-19**], he was brought to the
operating room and had stabilization of his spine by the
Orthopedic Spine Surgery.  The spinal surgery was recorded to
be a T5-T6 anterior vertebrectomy with anterior rod
stabilization as well as posterior stabilization of the cords
via instrumentation.  This was done removing the left 4th rib
in posterior position in order to gain access.

On [**2197-12-20**], once the C-spine stabilization had been
completed, the patient was evaluated by the Department of
Physical Therapy.  It was found that at that point he had a
stage II decubitus ulcer on his sacrum, as well as a stage I
to II decubitus ulcer on his right heel.  Again, he continued
to be intubated and sedated, again, using Ativan and Dilaudid
drips.  From [**12-21**] to [**12-23**] attempts to light sedation and
weaning from ventilation continued.  We continued the
physical therapy.  He was following commands and we found
improvement in his oxygen saturation.  On [**2197-12-23**], the
chest tube was discontinued.  He continued to require pain
control for increased agitation, although we continued
ventilator weaning.  From [**2197-12-24**] to [**2197-12-26**], he had
bronchoscopy for increased secretions, again, still
attempting to wean him from ventilation.

On [**2197-12-27**] he was found to have decreased oxygen
saturations, increased respiratory distress.  Chest x-ray
revealed a left lower lobe lung collapse.  Again, he
underwent bronchoscopy finding increased secretions.
Ventilator settings were changed over to pressure support.
The lung was found to be reinflated after bronchoscopy.

On [**2197-12-28**], the patient was extubated.  At this time, he
continues to be off the ventilator.  He has been found to
have increased secretions, although he has been able to
maintain the oxygen saturation above 98% with the face mask.
