Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
fall

Intubation
Pericardial tap and drain placement


History of Present Illness:
74 yo man with CHF and EF of 20%, A fib on coumadin s/p recent
AVJ ablation who was recently started on HD, presents s/p
mechanical fall backwards on [**11-27**] onto back of head down [**6-12**]
steps w/o LOC. Patient eventually transferred to the CCU for
management of large pericardial effusion and evidence of early
tamponade, seen on echo.
.
Presented to OSH A&O x 3, neurologically intact. CT demonstrated
SAH without mass effect & C6-7 widening. Pt developed nausea and
AMS, was intubated for airway protection, was started on
levophed for hypotension, given FFP and vitamin K, and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, CT torso demonstrated a moderate pericardial
effusion and bilateral pleural effusions. He also had signs of
active bleeding into his left thigh.
.
According to his wife and 4 daughters, at baseline Mr. [**Known lastname 27462**] is
able to mow the lawn & perform many ADLs/IADLS without chest
pain. He was very well until ~ 1 month ago when he developed "a
cold," and was hospitalized with acute on chronic renal failure,
course c/b afib with RVR, volume overload and hypotension. He
had 2 prolonged hospitaliztions but according to his wife was
home now and finally getting back to his baseline functional
status. He has dyspnea on exertion which has been improving
since starting HD, as has his LE edema. No history of orthopnea,
PND, or syncope.

He has had symptoms of orthostatic hypotension since starting HD
which are worse on his dialysis days. His fall was witnessed and
was clearly mechanical.
Echo on [**11-28**] demonstrated a severely depressed LVEF (20-25%),
as well as a large pericardial effusion with evidence of early
tamponade. As such, the patient was transferred to the CCU.
Patient underwent pericardiocentesis on [**11-29**], and 1350cc
serosanguinous fluid drained (drain left in place).
.

Past Medical History:
Atrial fibrillation on coumadin, s/p ablation recently (unclear
if afib vs AVN ablation)
CHF with EF 10-15% s/p PPM/ICD ([**7-16**])
ESRD on HD(last HD = [**2165-11-27**])
s/p liver transplant for cryptogenic cirrhosis, on chronic
immunosuppression ([**2157-6-7**], [**Hospital1 1774**])

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Studies:
ECHO [**2165-11-28**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid to distal inferior
and inferolateral walls. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a large pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. Stranding is visualized within
the pericardial space c/w organization. There is right
ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Large
pericardial effusion with evidence of early tamponade.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2165-11-29**]:
1. Opening pericardial pressure was 18 mm Hg. This fell to 15 mm
Hg
after removal of 100 cc of serosanguinous fluid from the
pericardial
space. After removal of 1350 cc of serosanguinous fluid, the
pericardial
pressure fell to -5 mm Hg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pericardial tamponade.
2. Successful removal of 1350 cc of serosanguinous pericardial
effusion.
.
ECHO [**2165-11-30**]:  IMPRESSION: Concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy with global hypokinesis and more severe hypokinesis
of the inferior wall. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. Trivial pericardial effusion which is slightly
more prominent around the right atrium.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-11-28**],
the large pericardial effusion has mostly resolved. Estimated
pulmonary artery pressures are slightly higher. The left
ventricular ejection fraction appears slightly more vigorous.
.
ECHO [**2165-12-4**]: LV systolic function appears depressed. RV with
depressed free wall contractility. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Other Imaging Studies:
CT C-Spine:
1. Widening of the ventral intervertebral disc space at the
C6-C7 level,
suggestive of anterior longitudinal ligament rupture. No
associated fracture is identified at this level. Please note,
patient has a cardiac pacer and cannot get MR.
  2. Multilevel degenerative change with a prominent posterior
osteophyte noted at the C5 to C6 level.
.
CT Head:
1. Diffuse bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, right greater than
left.
2. Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left
lateral and 4th
ventricles. No associated hydrocephalus.
3. Left parietal subgaleal hematoma.
4. Fluid in the nasopharynx and bilateral ethmoid sinuses most
likely
attributed to intubation.
.

CT CHEST: The aorta opacifies normally without evidence of
traumatic injury.  The pulmonary arteries opacify normally
without evidence of pulmonary embolism. The heart is mildly
enlarged and there is a large simple pericardial effusion. No
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is identified.  There are
moderate bilateral pleural effusions which are simple with
adjacent atelectasis. No masses or nodules are identified. An
AICD is in place. An endotracheal tube terminates above the
carina. Secretions are noted at the carina. An NG tube is noted
within the esophagus terminating in the stomach.
.
CT ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are
normal in
appearance. There two low-density lesions in the upper pole of
the right
kidney which most likely represents a renal cyst. The left
kidney is somewhat small in appearance, but otherwise
unremarkable. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid or free air within the
abdomen. There is atherosclerotic disease of the descending
aorta with no evidence of traumatic injury. Specifically, there
is atherosclerotic disease at the origin of the celiac trunk
with narrowing and post stenotic dilitation.
.
CT PELVIS: There are no pelvic masses. There is a small amount
of simple
free fluid in the pelvis. A Foley is noted within the bladder.
There is
diverticulosis of the descending colon without evidence of
diverticulitis.
The small bowel is unremarkable in appearance. There is a
hematoma noted
adjacent and posterior to the left iliac bone whi
