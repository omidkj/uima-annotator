Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**]
Chief Complaint:
Presents for surgery

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**5-9**] total colectomy with end ileostomy


History of Present Illness:
83F CAD w/ DES to RCA+RPL in [**2194**], EF 45%, a-fib not
anticoagulation for GIB, now with post-op MI and afib s/p
colectomy on [**5-10**]. She was admitted on [**5-9**] for total colectomy
with end ileostomy which she underwent on [**5-10**]. The immediate
post op course was complicated by SVT, hypotension, and low
urine output and she was found to have an NSTEMI with CK peak
708 on [**5-12**]. Echo on [**5-15**] showed EF 45% with new WMA compared
with previous echo: anterior, apical, septal HK. She was
monitored in the SICU until [**5-21**] for rapid afib that was
difficult to control as well as CHF. Today she states that she
is doing well with no episodes of SOB or CP. She was transferred
to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 because her telemetry showed HR 110s, although she is
quite well appearing satting 98% on RA, awaiting rehab
placement.

Past Medical History:
-Atrial fibrillation.  She is on Plavix, but held in ten days
prior to colonoscopy on [**2197-3-16**].  Will not restart until [**3-26**], [**2197**], as increased risk of bleeding following procedures.
-Hypertension.
-Anemia.
-History of gastrointestinal bleeding.
-History of ovarian cancer.
-Glaucoma.
-Macular degeneration.
-Depression.
-Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
-Lumbar scoliosis and spinal stenosis.
-Ovarian cancer.
-Ulcerative colitis
- Mass in distal colon, planned for total colectomy after
Passover
- type 2 DM


Social History:
She is a widow, does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.
Recently moved to senior center in [**Location (un) **].  Two daughters and

three grandchildren.  One daughter lives in area

Family History:
Positive for CAD, diabetes, negative for inflammatory bowel
disease, or colon cancer.

Physical Exam:
Vitals:  T 100.7  HR 82   BP 114/58   RR  94% RA
Gen: elderly female in NAD, quite animated and talking on the
phone Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
CV: irregularly irregular, SEM at LUSB.
Chest: mostly clear, basilar crackles.
Abd: mild TTP throughout, midline incision, well healing, though
inferior aspect of scar is open with packing, with minimal
serous drainage, no surrounding erythema, there is an ostomy bag
in place.
Ext: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2197-5-15**] demonstrated:
EF 45% anterior, apical, septal HK
RV FW HK TR gradient 26-38
[**1-17**]+TR, trivial MR
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-12-1**],
the regional  left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new.

Persantine Mibi performed on [**2197-3-31**] demonstrated:
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion scan.
CONCLUSION: Mild chest pain with dypiridamole infusion and no
ischemic EKG changes. Nuclear findings under separate report.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2194-12-1**] demonstrated:
right dominant circulation
LMCA: 20% distal lesion.
LAD: "twin LAD system" with major diagonal branch (larger than
LAD).
eccentric 60-70% stenosis at the origin of D1.
LCX: nl
RCA: had 60% ostial, 60% focal mid (cypher placed), 90% focal in
mod sized RPL branch beyond PDA (cypher placed).
--Successful PTCA of the PLB with a 2.5 mm balloon, PTCA of the
mid RCA with a 2.5 mm balloon and PTCA and stenting of the
ostial RCA with a 3.0 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent. Final
angiography showed a 30% residual stenosis of the PLB, a 50%
residual stenosis of the mid RCA and no residual stenosis of the
RCA origin, a type A dissection of the PLB with normal flow in
the vessel (see PTCA comments).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left ventricular diastolic function.
3. Successful PTCA of the PLB and mid RCA.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA.
.
CXR [**2197-5-19**]:
Previous mediastinal vascular congestion has improved.  Lungs
are clear. Hilar enlargement suggests longstanding elevated
pulmonary artery pressure, although heart size is top normal.
Pleural effusion, if any, is small and probably bilateral.
Severe gaseous distention of the stomach persists.
Findings were discussed by telephone with the medical student
answering for resident, [**Doctor Last Name **], at the time of dictation.

[**2197-6-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
single-lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous
approach. Final internal length is 33 cm with the tip positioned
in the distal SVC. The line is ready to use.
