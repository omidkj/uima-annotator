Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
elevated PCWP, severe MR/TR found intraoperatively

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Trans esphageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75M with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2089**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to
D1, SVG to RCA), DMII and critical AS who was scheduled for
cardiac cath and aortic valve replacement two days ago ([**2107-8-8**])
and found to have elevated PCWP and severe TR/MR [**Last Name (Titles) 25299**]. He is
transferred to CCU for volume status to be optimized before
repeat AVR.
.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] in [**2107-6-11**] with dizziness, nausea, and
vomiting. He was also experiencing episodes of unsteady gait [**3-15**]
verigo. He was found to have severe aortic stenosis on echo
during that admission (valve area <0.8cm2)and recommended to
return at the end of [**Month (only) **] for aortic valve replacement. He was
also diagnosed with a comm acquired pneumonia and completed a
course of abx. After discharge, pt went to rehab for 2 weeks and
then returned home where he continued to have vertigo and
fatigue. He came in on [**8-4**] for scheduled cath pre-op and per pt
showed that CABG vessels were patent (need to confirm this on
official report). He was taken to the OR yesterday and per
report found to have unexpected wide open with dilated RV on
TEE. Surgery aborted procedure and he was returned to ICU.
Reported PA pressures were 80-90.

.
Carotid dopplers [**2107-8-9**]: Less than 40% stenosis of the
bilateral extracranial internal carotid arteries.
.
Echo [**2107-8-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its
severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-7-4**],
the findings are similar with critical aortic stenosis, moderate
mitral regurgitation (maybe understimated), and moderate
estimated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 75 y/o man with CAD s/p CABG in [**2089**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG
to D1, SVG to RCA), DMII and critical AS who was scheduled for
elective AVR [**2107-8-6**] and found intra-operatively to have wide
open MR/TR on echo and elevated PA pressures. Procedure was
aborted and he was transferred to CCU for medical optimization.
.
1) Aortic stenosis, MR, TR - Pt had documented critical AS with
an aortic valve area of 0.6cm, a peak gradient of 58mm Hg (mean
gradient 34mm Hg), and peak velocity 3.8m/sec. Due for aortic
valve replacement but found to be hemodynamically unstable
intra-op. While under the care of the CCU, he was diuresed to
LOS fluid balance of -13L. His dry weight was 71kg, down from
76kg on admission. TTE [**8-11**] showed 2+ MR and 1+ TR. The patient
had hoped to go home for a few weeks before a second attempt at
AVR, but given the severity of his AS and how well optimized the
patient appeared hemodynamically, the decision was made to
attempt surgery before d/c. On [**2107-8-18**], the day before surgery
was anticipated, a Swann catheder was placed to asses
hemodynamics. This revealed PAP 90/4, RV 87/27, and wedge 23.
Given this evidence of persistantly severe MR and pulmonary
hypertension, the decision was made to postpone surgery. Cardiac
cath and balloon valvuloplasty were done on [**8-22**] with valve area
improved to 0.74 with 1+ AR. Pt was discharged on lasix Po for
further diuresis and will return in [**Month (only) 216**] for repeat evaluation
for AVR.
.
2) atrial fibrilation - First noted [**8-12**], intermittent,
responsive to IV BBlocker. Patient was hemodynamically stable
and asymptomatic during these episodes. No known Hx of A Fib. EP
was consulted and recommended 3 weeks of amiodorone 400mg daily,
and then amiodorone 200mg daily indefinitely. Pt was on heparin
drip during most of hospital course as surgery was anticipted
with the plan to bridge to coumadin before d/c. TSH checked to
look for underlying causes of afib, but was normal. Metoprolol
25mg [**Hospital1 **] also added for rate control. Pt was started on coumadin
prior to discharge and INR was 1.2. He will be followed by Dr. [**Name (NI) 25300**] office for coumadin adjustment.
.
3) CAD - Pt is s/p CABG with graft vessels found to widely
patent on cath during admission. ASA 81mg daily and lipitor 80mg
QHS were continued throughout admission.
.
4) DM ?????? Pt was follwed by the [**Hospital **] clinic who adjusted his
basal dose of Lantus with humolog sliding scale.
.
5) Dental - Dental consulted to evaluate what appeared to be a
hematoma in the patient's mouth, likely secondary to trauma
(biting). Recommended clorhexidine mouth rinses and abx
prophylaxis (clinda, given PCN allergy) for surgery. If not
resolved in [**8-20**] days, pt should see dentist as an
