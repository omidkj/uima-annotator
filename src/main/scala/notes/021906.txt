CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2122-7-27**] 9:07 PM, Radiology Read:
There is cardiomegaly. There are markedly increased interstitial
markings, with smaller more alveolar opacities at both bases.
There are small bilateral effusions. Findings are compatible
with pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions. Old films to
confirm resolution after treatment is recommended.
.
Echo ([**7-28**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2122-3-17**], the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 42M with DM1, ESRD on HD, HTN, presented to the ED with
hypertensive crisis and SOB c/w fluid overload, s/p emergent HD
in the MICU, subsequently called out to the floor. The following
issues were investigated during this hospitalization:
.
# Hypertension: Pt. has a history of poorly controlled blood
pressure and this episode was thought to be due to his inability
to tolerate medications secondary to nausea/vomiting. BP
improved after HD and patient was on all of his outpatient
antihypertensives on discharge.
.
# SOB. Likely pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive
urgency/emergency. Pt also reported a cough productive of green
sputum raising concern for pulmonary infection, but no fevers
elevated WBC were observed during his hospitalization. CXR
showed improvement in pleural effusion s/p HD, but could not
rule out consolidation. Given lack of symptoms as described,
patient was not started on antibiotics. An echo performed showed
no significant changes from prior. Patient was also ruled out
for an MI with elevated (given ESRD), but stable troponins. With
conitnued HD, patient had no additional complaints of shortness
of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**].
.
# ESRD c/b hyperkalemia: Patient underwent dialysis
successfully, the first emergent session notable for removal of
5 kg. He was then continued on his regular regimen of dialysis
while in-house with no complications.
.
# Mental Status: Patient was noted to be occasionally somnolent,
which per HD staff, has occurred before. Still, given his
persistent somnolence, Klonopin, which the patient was receiving
for anxiety, was witheld with noted improvement. Patient was
oriented x 3, awake and alert, able to follow commands and
well-related on discharge.
.
# DMI: Patient was maintained on his outpatient regimen of NPH
with HISS initially, but his PM NPH was decreased from 30 to 15
U given some episodes of hypoglycemia.
.
# Depression: Patient was maintained on his outpatient
Citalopram 20mg daily.
