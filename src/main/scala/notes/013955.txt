History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with coronary
artery disease s/p CABG with aortic valve replacement 10 years
ago and recent NSTEMI [**2-/2158**] as well as hypertension, GERD,
prostate CA admitted from rehab to [**Hospital3 2783**] [**5-14**] with
weakness, lethargy, fever, diagnosed with possible
hospital-acquired left lower lobe pneumonia (hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] since [**2158-2-10**]) and placed on
vancomycin and cefepime (possibly ceftazidime on [**5-14**]).  Found to
have MSSA bacteremia by report, and OSH transthoracic echo
showed no vegetations on [**5-14**].  CT scan chest on [**5-16**] showed
bilateral pleural plaque formation, collapse of T3 vertebra with
paravertebral soft tissue densisty, suspicious for T2-3 diskitis
with adjacent osteomyelitis. CT abdomen on [**5-16**] was unremarkable.
 On [**5-17**] vancomycin was discontinued and nafcillin 2g IV q4h was
started; also on gentamicin, rifampin at that time. MRI on [**5-17**]
showed large epidural abscess measuring 8 x 1.5 2 cm
with significant cord compression at T4 level with extensive
paravertebral phlegmon. Had lower extremity weakness and sensory
changes below the nipple line distally. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
emergently for neurosurgical management.

Studies:

ECG [**2158-5-17**]: Sinus rhythm. Modest ST-T wave changes with
prolonged QTc interval are non-specific but clinical correlation
is suggested for possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

ECHO [**2158-5-18**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen.

Chest [**2158-5-18**]: CHEST, AP: A replaced right subclavian line
terminates in the high right atrium, near the cavoatrial
junction. Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged in
course and position. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate left and
small right pleural effusion are unchanged. Mild interstitial
edema and cardiomegaly persist. The aorta is calcified and
tortuous. Changes of median sternotomy and aortic valve
replacement are noted.  IMPRESSION: Devices in standard
position. Mild volume overload.

Chest Xray [**2158-5-18**]: CHEST, AP: Endotracheal tube has been
removed. New right PICC ends in the right atrium, 3 cm beyond
the cavoatrial junction. Right dialysis catheter again
terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax.
 Moderate layering left effusion persists. The cardiomediastinal
and hilar contours are normal, with changes of CABG and aortic
valve replacement. Lung volumes are low, with mild bibasilar
atelectasis. IMPRESSION: Right PICC 3 cm beyond cavoatrial
junction. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified on [**2158-5-25**] at 10:20 a.m.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86804**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with CAD s/p CABG with
bioprosthetic AVR [**58**] years prior and recent NSTEMI as well as
HTN, GERD, prostate CA and h/o GIB admitted with MSSA bacteremia
and epidural abscess with cord compression.

#. Epidural abscess s/p laminectomy: He was admitted on [**2158-5-17**]
and underwent emergent 1. Bilateral T1 laminotomy, 2.
Laminectomy T2, T3, T4, T5, 3. Open resection interspinal
abscess, 4. Deep bone biopsy, 5. Deep muscle biopsy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**]
after initial evaluation by medicine.  Postoperatively he was
brought to the SICU and placed in a CTO brace to be worn at all
times when OOB.  He is on strict logroll precautions when not in
his CTO brace.  He was extubated on POD 1 without complication.
His blood cultures grew MSSA and the infectious disease team
recommended a 6 week course of nafcillin.  He will need a weekly
CBC/diff, chem7, and LFTs.  He will have a follow-up appointment
in 3 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] and repeat surgery in 6 weeks.  He
also underwent TEE on [**5-18**] which showed no vegetations.  His pain
was controlled with standing tylenol and oral oxycodone, with
occasional supplementation with IV morphine.

#. Delirium: He had delirium post-operatively that gradually
improved with pain control and reorientation.  He was given
olanzapine twice daily as needed for agitation.

#. Nutrition: He had marked aspiration during his admission and
had a speech and swallow evaluation which he failed.  He
ultimately had a PEG tube placed on [**5-24**] without complication.
Tube feeds were then initiated.

#. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: He has a history of mild
systolic CHF.  His diuretics were initially held and Lasix was
held on admission.  He is also on Aldactone at as outpatient and
this should be added back as volume status tolerates.  He was
continued on his home ACE-I and beta blocker.

#. CAD s/p NSTEMI: He had an NSTEMI in [**2-19**] and was started on
Plavix at that time.  His Plavix was held perioperatively and
restarted on POD 7.  He was continued on his outpatient beta
blocker and aspirin was also restarted post-operatively.  His
Imdur was held and should be restarted as blood presure
tolerates.
