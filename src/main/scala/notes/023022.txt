CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2195-11-6**] 11:08 PM
Post-surgical changes consistent with right pneumonectomy are
again identified. There is a relative reticular nodular
interstitial pattern of the native left lung which is
accentuated in the lung base but relatively stable to the prior
radiograph. No pneumothorax is seen. Median sternotomy wires
remain linearly aligned.
IMPRESSION: Post right pneumonectomy consistent with given
history. There is a reticular nodular interstitial pattern
accentuated in the left lung base which is suspicious for a
developing infectious process.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2195-11-7**] 7:24 AM
Lower lobe pulmonary findings are consistent with atypical
pneumonia or aspiration. Drug reaction is considered less
likely.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2195-11-11**] 12:23 PM
Stool is seen in the right colon and to a lesser degree in the
left colon. A single loop of gas filled small bowel is seen in
the midline. High-density material along the right iliac crest
is probably retained contrast in a diverticulum. Bony structures
are notable for degenerative changes. There are vascular
calcifications.
No evidence of obstruction. Stool in colon.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2195-11-13**] 2:53 PM
No evidence of obstruction or perforation. Large amount of dense
stool in the colon and rectum.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2195-11-14**] 2:25 PM
There is a whiteout of the right chest and mediastinal shift
consistent with previous removal of right lung. The left lung
appears clear. No evidence of pneumonia is identified.
Left lower lobe pneumonia has cleared.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old female lung Ca s/p pneumonectomy presenting with
worsening SOB, productive cough with CXR demonstrating
inflitrate left lower lobe.
.
#)Dyspnea/SOB- Considered CHF, MI, vs pneumonia, COPD
exacerbation, pulmonary embolism should be considered, in
addition to flare of chronic lung disease, COPD. Treated for
pneumonia, given x-ray and bandemia, CAP at this time. Patient
allergic to penicillin. Likely pneumonia, COPD flare with
inability to fully compensate given pneumonectomy. When patient
on the floor, initial ABG was 7.32/70/87. She was reported to
have transient desaturations to 80% between NEBs, with RR around
30. She reported feeling anxious, with air hunger, and
complainted of fatigue. She required NEBs every hour. A repeat
ABG just before transfer to the ICU was 7.37/62/86. It was
decided to transfer her to the ICU for closer respiratory
monitoring and need for more frequent respiratory care.  In
MICU, steroids initiated, spiriva, chest PT. Pt afebrile, within
few days stable for floor. On floor similar even [**11-5**], though
cleared within minutes. Albuterol/Tipratropium nebs given.
Levofloxacin 750 mg IV q 24 for pneumonia treated for 5 day
course. Pt a chronic CO2 retainer from trends to [**2190**] post
pneumonectomy. Flu vaccine. [**11-14**] rales half left side, ronchi,
sob, nebs given, solumedrol 80 mg, CXR clear. Changed to
salmeterol, albuterol as needed, prednisone 40 with taper,
spiriva. Pt with no new episodes of SOB or oxygen desaturation
while in house and rales improving on left side, pt feeling
better denying any SOB, CP, cough. Pt with desaturation to high
80's on ambulation, sating well on RA while sitting. Pt d/c'd
with steriods and inhalers and O2. Pt to follow up with NP for
steriod therapy next week.
.
Ileus/ constipation- [**11-10**] emesis and nausea, with no BM x 2
days. Tachy but no EKG changes concern for obstruction, no BM x
2 days. dulcolax, simethicone, clears, repeat KUBs in AM. Within
three days resolved with enema and aggressive bowel regimen.
.
#hyperglycemia- result of steroids, glucose as high as 467.
Lantus 6 and ISS to adjust as needed.  Pt d/c'd home with Rx for
Lantus 6U, to follow up with PCP.
.
#)Htn- BP elevation likely physiologic response to stress with
dyspnea increased work of breathing. Continued on diltiazem,
short acting. ASA for CAD, although no clear documentation of
CAD.  BP stable on dilt.
.
#)Lung Ca- large cell carcinoma; managed with R pneumonectomy
and radiation therapy;followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of thoracic surgery
service. CT chest for follow up to be performed in the next
month.
.
#)Rhinorrhea- nasal congestion. persistent despite use of
flonase; referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of ENT and diagnosed with
esophageal reflux disease, treated with omeprazole and
ranitidine. Pt reports she currently only takes protonix.
