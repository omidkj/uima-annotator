Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
58 y.o male with h/o DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, with known
dz per cath in [**2114**] where pt had 95% mid RCA stenosis, 70% Lcx,
60% LAD and 40% L main with recent 4 vessel CABG on [**2123-3-4**] (LIMA
to LAD, SVG to OM, ramus, RCA), who presents with acute
SOB/respiratory distress.  He present to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] where he
was found to be acidemic (ABG 7.08/87/91), intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  He was started on a heparin
gtt and nitro gtt.  He also had ?Vtach on EKG and was started on
lidocaine drip. There was a question of t-wave changes on EKG,
and he was transferred here for cardiac catheterization and
further management.  Cath on arrival showed patent grafts (no
PTCA performed), and he was brought to CCU for further
management.


Past Medical History:
1.  CAD, s/p recent CABG as above; TTE [**3-6**] showing dilated
LA/LAV, 1+ MR, EF=20-30%, with BiV pacer for ventricular
arrhythmias

3.  Melanoma s/p excisions
4.  DM x 2 years
5.  Recurrent PNA
6.  GERD
7.  gout
8.  Sleep apnea

Ex-smoker, with 40 pack-year smoking history. He quit in [**2106**].
He lives with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] history of EtOH consumption.

Father with MI in 50s

Physical Exam:
VS:   99.0   89/55   60   14  100% on AC, FiO2=100%, 700/14,
PEEP=10
Gen: in mild distress, intubated
HEENT:  PERRL, OP clear
Lungs: crackes at bases, no w/r

Abd: soft, nt/nd, nabs, no masses
Groin: right groin with sheath, left with triple lumen
Extr: no c/c/e, DP 2+ bilat
Neuro: moving all 4 extremities

Pertinent Results:
EKG at OSH: Wide complex tachycardia, right axis, LBBB; rate=102

CXR: mild failure

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD; no anginal symptoms on admission, but cardiac
catheterization was performed to rule out ischemia as a cause of
his ?CHF flare and respiratory distress.  Catheterization
revealed patent vein grafts, and no intervention was performed.
He was continued on his Aspirin, Lipitor, Lisinopril, Coreg.
His dose of lisinopril was increased to 20 mg daily while the
Coreg was increased to 12.5 mg twice daily.  His lipid profile
was checked, and his LDL was found to be 50, so his dose of
Lipitor was decreased to 40 mg daily.  He had no anginal
symptoms or EKG changes, and he was discharged on his medical
regimen, to follow up with his PCP and cardiologist.

2. CHF: His chest X-ray and exam on admission was consistent
with congestive heart failure (likely the cause of his
respiratory distress on admission).  He was diuresed with good
success, 1-1.5 L each day with IV lasix.  TTE was repeated
showing EF=15-20% with worsening of systolic function from prior
TTE.  Although the cause of his current CHF flare was never
definitively determined, it was thought to be secondary to
dietary indiscretions (patient had apparently eaten ?salty
chinese food prior to presentation).  He was euvolemic at time
of discharge and will continue his home lasix/potassium regimen.
 He will weigh himself daily and have his creatinine/K checked
in [**3-5**] days after discharge.  He declined evaluation for heart
transplant at this time.

3. Rhythm: He had ?ventricular tachycardia at the outside
hospital. His pacemaker was interrogated by EP while in-house
who thought that his arrhythmia was sinus tachycardia.  NIPS
study was performed, and the pacemaker was found to be
functioning properly.  His amiodarone was continued at his
current dose, and he will follow up in device clinic.

4. Respiratory: intubated in [**Location (un) 620**] for hypercarbic respiratory
failure, and he was extubated at [**Hospital1 18**] on day of admission after
some diuresis.  He likely was in respiratory distress secondary
to pulmonary edema.  He remained stable after extubation and was
saturating adequately on room air at time of discharge.  He was
continued on his atrovent and advair while in-house.

5. Chronic RF; baseline 1.3-1.5; his creatinine remained below
his baseline but increased to 1.3 at time of discharge (likely
after diuresis).  He was instructed to have his Creatinine
rechecked 3-4 days after discharge.

6. Dispo: He was discharged in good condition and will follow up
with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], cardiac surgeon, and
electrophysiologist.
