CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57[**Hospital 4622**] nursing
home resident female, who had been in her usual state of
health until about three weeks ago when the daughter noted
she was sleeping more.  Per record, she has had multiple
episodes in the last week of changes in mental status.  EMTs
called many times.  The patient would awake prior to arrival
and not need transfer.  The patient was seen at the [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**10-15**].  No localizing
etiology of delta MS.  That evening she was unresponsive and
the patient was brought to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  There her
oxygen she was sating 65% on room air, increased to 98% with
a nonrebreather mask.  There an ABG was done which showed an
ABG of 7.42, 62, and 55.  She had a head CT that was
negative.  Chest x-ray that was questionable left lower lobe
infiltrate.  Lumbar puncture was performed and the micro
cultures are still pending.

She was seen by Psychiatry at the outside hospital, but noted
there was no psychoses, but delirium.  The patient's mental
status waxed and waned there.  She also had a K of 6.0 and
given 30 of Kayexalate, 5 of Haldol, 2 mg of Ativan given for
agitation, and 2 mg of ceftriaxone was given for a
temperature of 101.3 with a concern for meningitis as a LP
was done prior.

Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] as the
patient's primary care provider was here.  She is currently
being seen by [**Hospital3 4262**] Group.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], she was
unresponsive with an oxygen saturation of 72% on 6 liters.
She was placed on 50% vent mask, which improved her
oxygenation to 97%.  Patient was placed on BiPAP.  Original
ABG here before BiPAP was 7.19, 102, and 92.  After being
placed on BiPAP, her blood pressure decreased to the 80s.
She responded to 1 liter of IV fluids, normal saline and
blood pressure remained stable.  Patient had peripheral IV x1
placed and right femoral line placed in the ED.  When laying
flat, her sats decreased to 50% on 30% FIO2, PEEP of 10, and
pressure support of 5.  Her ABG at the time was 7.24, 91, and
38.  Once the patient sat up, her sats improved and her
airway was no longer obstructed.

After a history on BiPAP about a half an hour, her ABG was
7.29, 79, and 106 on 30% pressure support of 5 and PEEP of
10.  Patient was intermittently awaking.  She denied any pain
and was not answering questions at the time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure issues:  The patient
presented with changes in mental status, pCO2 of 100, pH of
7.19, decreasing sats on arrival likely element of
obstructive-sleep apnea.  She was monitored overnight.  She
had admitted to the MICU and had multiple episodes of apnea
throughout the night.  She was placed on pressure support,
which improved her saturations and decreased her hypercarbia.
Patient improved that her mental status with improvement of
her oxygenation and ventilation as well as for correction of
her respiratory acidosis.  Patient was eventually placed on
BiPAP on hospital day three, on the date prior to discharge
of BiPAP settings of [**12-24**]/5 liters of oxygen with saturations
of 96% with a gas of 7.38, 67, and 91 with an aim of a goal
pCO2 of 67.  She only had one episode of apnea on the day
prior to discharge.

2. Delta MS/mental status issues:  Most likely her waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status and hypercarbia/hypoxia compounded by
infection of pneumonia and UTI.  With improvements of her
ventilation and oxygenation and treatment with levofloxacin
of her UTI and pneumonia, her mental status greatly improved
on hospital day two without further waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].  Her
daughters came by and visited her, and reported that she was
at her baseline mental status on the day prior to discharge.
B12, folate, RPR were all sent that were unremarkable as
causes for delta MS.  We are awaiting results of the lumbar
puncture from the outside hospital, but on hospital day two.
Those cultures are still pending at the time.  Patient was
also given multivites.

3. Fever issues:  The patient initially presented with T max
of 101.3 at outside hospital with increasing white blood cell
counts and a positive urinalysis.  A chest x-ray with
bilateral patchy infiltrates likely pneumonia and UTI.  Upon
calling the outside hospital, the urine was growing out
Klebsiella, and patient was given a 10 day course of
levofloxacin to cover both the pneumonia and UTI.  Blood
cultures and urine cultures are still pending at this
hospital visit and the CSF fluid from [**Hospital1 882**] needs to be
further evaluated.

Patient on the day of discharge was afebrile with a
decreasing white count x48 hours.

4. Acute renal failure issues:  Creatinine initially
presented at 1.3.  Patient is known to have a baseline of
1.0, most likely hypovolemia and prerenal.  A FENa was sent,
was 0.3%.  Patient was gently hydrated and IV fluids started
up on a p.o. diet regimen.

On hospital day two, her creatinine returned to 0.8, and she
remained with a creatinine of 0.8 for the remainder of her
hospital stay.  Patient's K was followed, and trended back
down to normal on the day of discharge at 3.9.

5. Elevated transaminases:  Patient had no right upper
quadrant pain.  [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign was negative.  A right upper
quadrant ultrasound was performed that showed no hepatic or
biliary pathology likely due to acute phase stress changes
given the fact that she had no clinical symptoms.  There is
no need to followup these transaminases.
