Other results:
CT C/A/P ([**2189-6-9**]): results pending
DIPYRIDAMOLE STRESS TEST ([**2189-6-9**]):
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear
report sent separtely.
.
CARDIAC PERFUSION PERSANTINE ([**2189-6-9**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Fixed moderate sized perfusion defect in the apical/inferior
wall. 2.
Global hypokinesis with depressed ejection fraction and chamber
enlargement
.
CARDIAC ULTRASOUND:
IMPRESSION: Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral extracranial
internal
carotid arteries.
.
EKG ([**2189-6-3**]):  Sinus 71, Normal Axis, PR prolongation,
Interventricular conduction delay, LVH, TWI V5-V6 with
flattening in V3-V4. Compared to prior T wave flattening and
inversion new.
.
TTE ([**2189-5-27**]):
IMPRESSION: Critical aortic valve stenosis (0.6cm2). Symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction
c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. At least moderate mitral regurgitation. Increased
PCWP (PCWP>18mmHg). Dilated ascending aorta. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-11-15**], regional and global
left ventricular systolic function is now depressed and the
severity of aortic regurgitation and estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure have increased. The severity of aortic valve
stenosis and mitral regurgitation are similar.

coronary vessels and mitral annulus. Atherosclerotic
calcification involving the ascending aorta, arch and descending
aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o female with asthma, HTN, HLD, critical AS, and CHF who
presented for elective valvuloplasty.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Critical AS - Pt presented for CoreValve procedure. However,
due to pt's significant AR, safety of procedure was called into
question until further evaluation could be completed. Geriatrics
was consulted and carefully reviewed risks/benefits of
procedure. Pt continued to make clear that she was aware of the
potential risks and would still like to undergo a procedure to
fix her valve.  Pt had complete evaluation during
hospitalization, including carotid ultrasound, persantine
perfusion scan, dipyridamole stress test, and CT
chest/abdomen/pelvis.  Results of studies will be presented to
CoreValve board to determine her eligibility for study
participation
.
#Acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure - On
admission to hospital, pt was edematous and weighed 20 pounds
over baseline.  To improve pt's condition for procedure, pt was
aggressively diuresed over the course of her hospital stay with
IV Lasix. Her volume status was followed by serial exams to
determine efficacy of diuresis. Pt was then re-started on her
home dose of 20mg PO Lasix daily and remained euvolemic.  Pt was
not started on beta blocker during hospitalization given low
heart rate of 50-65.  ACE inhibitors were also held given
patient's renal status and decreased creatinine clearance.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:.
#Anxiety - Frequent episodes of anxiety were relieved by pt's
home regimen of Xanax.
.
#CAD s/p NSTEMI: Stable. Continued pt's home regimen of ASA 81
mg PO daily, Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg PO daily and started
Rosuvastatin 20 mg PO daily.  Beta blockers were held because of
bradycardia.
.
#Asthma: Stable. Continued pt's home regimen of
Fluticasone-Salmeterol 250/50 (Advair Diskus) 1 puffs INH [**Hospital1 **],
Montelukast (Singulair) 10 mg PO daily, and Fluticasone 1 spray
NU daily for allergies.
.
#Depression:  Stable. Continued pt's Escitalopram 10 mg PO
daily.
.
#Anemia: Hct remained stable.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pt will be discharged back to residential nursing home.  She
will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] once her eligibility for the
CoreValve trial has been established.  She must be compliant
with diet and diuretics to remain euvolemic should she be deemed
eligible. It is very important that she be weighed daily as her
diuretic regimen has been increased.


Medications on Admission:
1. Escitalopram 10 mg PO daily (Rehab list says 15 mg but
pharmacy says geriatric dose shouldn't exceed 10 mg)

INH [**Hospital1 **]
4. Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg PO daily
5. Montelukast (Singulair) 10 mg PO daily
6. Potassium chloride 10 mEq PO daily
