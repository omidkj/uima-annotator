NCHCT: 2.3cm right subdural with 1cm shift.  Ipsilateral
transtentorial herniation with effacement of the
paramesencephalic cistern.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the SICU and neurosurgical service.  She was
monitored closely neurologically and brought to the OR urgently
for right burr hole evacuation and a subdural drain was placed.
She tolerated this procedure and post op remained intubated and
transported back to SICU. Post-op CT showed evacuation of the
hematoma and presence of the subdural drain. Later that day, the
patient was extubated. On post-op day #1 the repeat CT showed
re-expansion of the brain and no new hemorrhage. Therefore, the
drain was removed.  She had a bolus of dilantin for a low level.
Neurologically she was doing well with improvement of left sided
weakness and she was transferred to the step-down unit. On
post-op day #2 her repeat head CT was stable and she was
transferred to the floor. Her dilantin level was higher than the
previous day, but still subtherapeutic and she received another
bolus. PT and OT evaluated the patient and recommended rehab.
She was discharged on [**2195-7-16**].
