CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2119-9-29**] 5:13 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: PNA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
46 year old woman with LLL PNA, hepatic failure now INtubated
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
PNA
INDICATION: Known left lower lobe pneumonia. Intubated.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: Single portable AP view of the chest shows diffuse
left lung consolidation. There also appears to be right lower
lung zone consolidation. An endotracheal tube is in good
position. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Diffuse left lung consolidation, and focal right
lower lobe consolidation, likely due to multilobar pneumonia.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2119-9-30**] 1:52 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: intercranial hemorrhage, herniation, cerebral edema

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
46 year old woman with hep B/C cirrohsis p/w fulminant liver
failure [**1-30**] tylenol tox, now with fixed dilated pupils
bilaterally.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
intercranial hemorrhage, herniation, cerebral edema
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 46 year old with hepatitis B and C cirrhosis in full
liver failure due to Tylenol toxicity. Now with fixed and
dilated pupils bilaterally.

TECHNIQUE: CT head without IV contrast.

No prior studies for comparison.

FINDINGS:
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation throughout both right and left
cerebral hemispheres is diminished indicative of diffuse
cerebral edema. In the left temporal lobe there is an increased
area of attenuation seen best on series 2A, images 7 through 9.
There is a significant amount of vasogenic edema within the left
temporal and parietal lobes. Mass effect is seen compressing the
left lateral ventricle with mild subfalcine herniation, left to
right. The right lateral ventricle also appears slightly
narrowed due to brain edema. The suprasellar cistern is
essentially completely effaced. The quadrigeminal plate cistern
similarly is completely effaced and not visible. The temporal
horns bilaterally are only faintly visible. In addition, the
foramen magnum is full.

Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the left and right maxillary
sinuses. The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses are
unremarkable. Soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1) Diffuse cerebral edema.

2) Findings consistent with subfalcine, uncal, transtentorial,
and tonsillar herniation.

3) Increased density in the left temporal lobe with surrounding
vasogenic edema raises the possibility of a hemorrhagic mass
with vasogenic edema compressing the left lateral ventricle. A
hemorrhagic stroke is considered less likely.
4) MRI can help in further evaluation.

These findings were immediately communicated to Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 14944**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo female h/o HepC HepB IVDU now with acute liver failure
likely [**1-30**] acetaminophen toxicity on chronic hepatitis,
leukocytosis, pneumonia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute
renal failure.  Pt evaluated for liver transplant by transplant
service but viewed to be unlikely candidate [**1-30**] pneumonia,
respiratory failure, and ongoing drug use.  Metabolic acidosis
improved with ventilation and dialysis;, pt treated with
mucomyst for acetominophen toxicity, given levoquin and zosyn
for likely pneumonia.  Echo wnl for increased but trending down
cardiac enzymes.  BLood pressure supported with pressors, and
maintained respiratory status with ventilation.  Pt noted during
first hospital night by house staff to have newly fixed and
dilated pupils, stat CT demonstrated global
