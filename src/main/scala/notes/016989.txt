Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

-Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11835**] is a 58 year-old man with DM, HTN, COPD, ESRD, history
of constrictive pericarditis s/p pericardiectomy who presented
to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2188-3-27**] with complaint of sharp
non-radiating chest pain that improved slightly with
nitroglycerin at home. In the outside ED he reveived 324 mg of
ASA and 1 inch of nitropaste. His EKG was notable for IVCD and
STDs in V4 and V6 with STE in V2. He also had a low probability
V/Q scan. He underwent an echocardiogram that revealed inferior
wall hypokinesis with preserved LVEF. He presented with a
Troponin T 0.02 which peaked at Troponin 1.14 with a CKMB 25.4
and a CK 266 effectively confirming an NSTEMI. On [**2188-3-28**], he
underwent cardiac catheterization that revealed severe
two-vessel disease. He is now transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of his CAD and cardiac surgery evaluation.
.
On initial evaluation at [**Hospital1 18**], he appears comfortable and is
without chest pain. His affect is notable for an avoidant
disposition with delayed but frank responses to questions.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of
the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

ECHO: [**2188-3-31**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 45 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular cavity dilation with mild
global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.,
cannot fully exclude multivessel CAD but appears less likely).
Mild mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2188-3-29**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:

Heart is top normal size, with pulmonary vasculature is engorged
in the upper lungs. Even though there is no definite pulmonary
edema and minimal if any pleural effusion. This may be an
indication of acute cardiac decompensation, depending upon the
appearance of prior chest radiographs not currently available.
No pneumothorax. No focal pulmonary abnormality.

ECG: [**2188-4-2**]:
Sinus rhythm. Ventricular ectopy. Right axis deviation. Left
bundle-branch
block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2188-4-1**] ventricular
ectopy is more frequent.

ECG: [**2188-3-29**]:
Sinus bradycardia with borderline prolongation of P-R interval.
Poor R wave progression - cannot exclude prior anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. Inferior and lateral ST-T wave changes
may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy or myocardial
ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 58 year-old man with DM, HTN, COPD, ESRD, history
of constrictive pericarditis s/p pericardiectomy transfered from
OSH with NSTEMI and evidence of severe two-vessel disease for
further management.

# CAD: Patient has evidence of severe two-vessel coronary artery
disease in the setting of long standing diabetes. He was
initially treated with aspirin 325 mg PO daily, Metoprolol 100mg
[**Hospital1 **], Nifedipine 90mg Daily, heparin drip. Patient was evaluated
by CT surgery and was not felt to be a good candidate for CABG.
A PCI was performed on [**2188-4-1**] and 2 drug eluting stents were
placed in the left circumflex artery. Stenosis in the LAD will
be evaluated as an outpatient under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**].

# CHF: Patient appears to be mildly volume overloaded on exam
and would benefit for gentle diuresis. His worsening renal
failure also contributed to his volume overload. He was diuresed
with iv lasix and metolazone.

# Renal failure/end stage ren
