Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
bleeding trach, clogged g tube

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Video Swallow [**2200-3-3**]: The oral phase was predominantly normal,
with slight prolongation of mastication. In the pharyngeal
phase, all initiation was normal, though there was difficulty
maintaining laryngeal valve and airway closure, incomplete
epiglottic deflection. Additionally, there was a residue noted
within the vallecula and piriform sinuses. Barium tablet,
swallowed with a puree bolus, seen passing freely through the
esophagus and pharynx into the stomach. Aspiration is noted with
nectar thick liquids, without spontaneous cough. Acute cough was
effective in eliminating the aspirate. Aspiration also occurred
with thin liquids.

IMPRESSION:

Trace aspiration as described above.

hospitalization for prolonged respiratory failure secondary to
pneumonia and aspiration with clogged PEG tube and possible
BRBPR. Per wife, they did not like the facility they were
because of poor nursing ratio and not getting appropriate
attention. Here he denies any symptoms, feels fine without any
abdominal pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, except for
some tenderness of RLE area or erythema. Was doing well on trach
collar for last 9hrs until started becoming more hypertensive

[**3-1**] CXR:
FINDINGS:

There is a tracheostomy tube, which appears to be in appropriate
position. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
The patient is status post anterior cervical fusion.

The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged when
compared to prior study. There are again noted diffuse bilateral
alveolar and interstitial opacities, consistent with the
clinical diagnosis of ARDS. There is no significant change when
compared to the prior study.

IMPRESSION:

1) Overall stable appearance of the chest with alveolar and
interstitial opacities, consistent with the clinical diagnosis
of ARDS.

2) Right pleural effusion appears to be stable.

[**3-1**] RLE Dopplers
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: The left common
femoral, greater saphenous, superficial femoral, and popliteal
veins were interrogated and reveal normal compressibility, color
flow, waveforms, and augmentation/respiratory variation. No
intraluminal thrombus is identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
For further history on this patient, please also see attached
discharge summary from recent previous admission.

67 yo M with HIV, CAD s/p CABG and PTCA, CHF, DM type 2, here
after recent hospitalization for resp failure secondary to pna
here with possible BRBPR and clogged PEG tube.
*
1. Respiratory failure: prolonged wean last admission requiring
tracheostomy, also remains NPO as concern for aspiration as well
as source of resp failure. Based on CXR unchanged bilateral
opacities- cont trach with vent support as needed and wean as
tolerated at Rehab.
Patient was continued on pressure support at 5/5 and trach
collar as tolerated. He was on trach collar for the last four
days of this admission without switching to PS.
Patient had completed 10 day courses of Levaquin/zosyn/Vanc last
admission and has been stable from infectious standpoint and no
growth on cultures. No new antibiotics were started on this
admission.
*
2. BRBPR: on exam here consistent with guiaic negative stools,
but +internal hemorrhoids- likely source of bleed. Hct 28 this
admission but has been stable at this- all of last admission.
Iron studies last admission consistent with iron deficiency and
chronic disease and likely HAART.  Patient was started on iron
for presumed iron deficiency. Patient was started on epogen for
HIV related bone marrow toxicity as well as renal insufficiency.
*
3. Clogged PEG tube: PEG was not clogged here on exam--
restarted tube feeds with flushes without problems during his
stay.
*
4. Diastolic Dysfunction: Last echo [**2200-2-8**] with LVEF>55%.
Patient was slightly fluid overloaded on exam and hypertensive
but had not received his medications. Continued his regular dose
of lasix/hypertensive meds ofmetoprolol, isordil, hydral,
norvasc and lasix
*
5. Chronic Renal Failure: since last admission now with new
baseline of 1.5 which was stable on this admission. We continued
to hold ace as hx of hyperkalemia in this setting in past.
*
6. Anemia: Likely combined with iron deficiency and chronic
disease. Started on iron and epogen this admission. Patient had
multiple ct scans on last admission to look for a source of the
bleed and all were negative. Did not require blood transfusion.
*
7. CAD: CAD s/p CABG s/p PTCA [**10-6**]. Patient had no anginal
symptoms. He was continued on asa/[**Year (2 digits) 4532**]/statin/betablocker. No
ace b/c of hyperkalmeia.
*
8. DMII- Continue NPH/SSI. [**Month (only) 116**] need adjustment as patient begins
regular diet.
*
9. HIV: Stable on HAART and Bactrim.
*
10. Superficial thrombophlebitis: Pt. got supportive care with
warm compresses. LENIS were negative.
*
10a. Anxiety: Stable on klonopin/ativan.
*
11. FEN: TFs were continued via PEG.
Video Swallow [**3-4**]:

 RECOMMENDATIONS:
      1.Initiate a po diet consistency of soft solids, thin
      liquids. PO meds may be given whole with purees (ie,
      applesauce, pudding, yogurt).
      2.Maintain aspiration precautions, as follows:
           a.Sit upright for meals.
           b.Take a sip from the cup or straw.
           c.Tuck your chin to your chest and swallow 3 times
           d.For each bite and sip, swallow 3 times.
           e.Alternate between taking bites & sips.
      3.Follow up speech therapy at rehab for dysphagia
      management and potential trach weaning.
TFs were stopped and patient ate two meals prior to discharge.
