Pertinent Results:
MRI at [**Location (un) **] on 3/ 25/ 09:
Very large, mixed signal intensity subdural hemorrhage extending
over the entire left frontal and parietal lobes, and which
appears to terminate
caudally at approximately the level of the left sylvian fissure.
 There is a small component of this hemorrhage overlying the
left occipital lobe.  The maximal thickness of the subdural
hemorrhage is 27 mm.  There is pronounced effacement of the
adjacent cortical sulci and approximately 7 mm right-sided
subfalcine herniation,as well as compression of the left lateral
ventricle.  There does not overt uncal or hippocampal herniation
at this time. on the FLAIR images are numerous subcentimeter
areas of elevated T2 signal within the white matter of both
cerebral hemispheres,
somewhat more prominent on the right side.  While nonspecific in
etiology, given patient age, chronic small vessel infarcts would
appear the most probable diagnosis, as opposed to
postinflammatory residua. There is no overt extracranial
abnormality detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU for close neurologic monitoring he
remained stable. He was started on antiseizure prophylaxis.  He
was readied for the OR.  On [**3-25**] he was brought to the OR where
under general anesthesia he underwent left burr hole evacuation
of subdural hematome.  He tolerated this procedure well, was
extubated and transferred back to the ICU. Post op CT showed
decrease in SDH and decreased shift.  His wounds were clean and
dry with staples.  His diet and activity were advanced. He
remained neurologically intact.  He was seen and evaluated by PT
and cleared for discharge to home.
