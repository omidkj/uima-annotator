History of Present Illness:
70 year old female with known aortic stenosis who compained of
chest pain and was sent to ER by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was transferred
from [**Hospital3 3765**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization. She
was found to have no coronary artery
disease and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for an
aortic valve replacement.  The patient's original surgery was
post-poned because she sustained a left tibial fracture due to a
fall on [**2151-3-16**], requiring surgery, leaving her non-weight
bearing for 6 weeks.  She presents for pre-admission testing
today.  She reports that her fatigue has increased in the
previous month.

Pertinent Results:
[**2151-5-31**] Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room.

POSTBYPASS:
The patient is A paced on low dose phenylephrine infusion. There
is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
There is no AR. Peak & mean gradients across the valve are
37mmHg & 20mmHg, respectively with a cardiac output of 4.18. The
remaining valves are unchanged. Biventricular function is
unchanged. The aorta remains intact.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2151-6-3**] 5:34 PM

Final Report:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right
internal jugular vein catheter has been removed.  The size of
the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Presence of a small left
pleural effusion is better seen on the lateral than on the
frontal radiograph.
There also is a probably atelectatic opacity adjacent to the
effusion.
No pulmonary edema, no evidence of pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was a same day admission to the operating Room on
[**2151-5-31**] where the patient underwent Aortic Valve Replacement
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see the operative note for details, in
summary she had: an aortic valve replaceemnt with a 21mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
tissue valve. Her bypass time was 52 minutes with a crossclamp
time of 40 minutes. She tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. She woke from
anesthesia neurologically intact and extubated on the day of
surgery. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented
and breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically
intact and hemodynamically stable.  Beta blockers were initiated
and the patient was begun on diuretics aiming toward diuresing
to the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued per cardiac
surgery protocol.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.
The remainder of the hospital course was uneventful.
By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating,
the wound was healing and pain was controlled with Vicodin.  The
patient was discharged  in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
