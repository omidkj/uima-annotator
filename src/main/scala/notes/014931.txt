Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncopal episode

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year-old man with idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis and emphysema complicated by pulmonary hypertension,
thus requiring home oxygen (4L via nasal cannula), transferred
from the [**Hospital 56335**] Hospital ICU for further evaluation and
management of hypoxemia.

Had contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by phone on [**9-26**] to report
progressive dyspnea on exertion, a resting O2sat 92% on 4 L, and
desaturation to the 70's with exertion. He was unable to come to
the hospital for further evaluation at that time. Subsequently
admitted to OSH [**9-29**] following a syncopal episode. He was
walking up the stairs using supplemental oxygen and began to
feel lightheaded at the top of the steps. He walked a few more
steps into his bedroom, put his arms out towards the bed, and
lost consciousness. His wife witnessed him bang the side of his
face on a dresser but there was no bleeding and he currently has
no pain. The next thing he remembers was the paramedics having
arrived at his home. Denies prodromal chest pain, palpitations,
shortness of breath, or nausea.

Although he reports progressive dyspnea on exertion ever since
stopping prednisone 3 weeks prior to admission, the natural
history of his illness is longer:  He has had clubbing of
several years standing and his shortness of breath, until this
year, was attributed to past smoking and possible occupational
exposures that were thought to have resulted in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  He had worked in several
industrial contexts, manufacturing ball bearings and later
cleaning injection moulds with solvents.  Exposures likely
included formalin and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.

His symptoms have been worse over the past week, and he becomes
short of breath after walking only 10 feet. Has had a chronic
cough which is unchanged. No fever, chills, headache,
rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgias, arthralgias, wheezing,
abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] has
received pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.

Upon arrival at the OSH, required 50%O2 via face mask as
desaturated to 70-80s with exertion. Was treated with lasix and
nebulized bronchodilators. Chest x-ray reportedly did not show
an infiltrate. Labs revealed tropI 0.029 followed by 0.04

Other studies:
EKG [**9-30**]
Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beat. Modest ST-T wave
changes are non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2158-6-19**]
the findings as outlined are now present.

CXR [**9-30**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute pulmonary abnormalities.
Unchanged appearance of the chest with findings corresponding to
patient's known IPF.

CT [**10-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1)No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection or aneurysm.
2)Significant progression of the predominantly subpleural
abnormality associated with traction bronchiolectasis,
reticulation, and new diffuse ground-glass opacities in the
presence of significant enlargement of the hilar and mediastinal
lymph nodes is worrying for and acute progression of IPF-UIP.
3)Borderline pulmonary arterial enlargement suggests mild
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


ECHO [**10-2**]
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
free wall hypokinesis. These findings are suggestive of a
primary pulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
  Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year-old man with 'idiopathic' pulmonary
fibrosis, hypertension and emphysema complicated by pulmonary
hypertension on home oxygen transferred from OSH after being
admitted following a syncopal episode for further evaluation and
management of hypoxemia.

Pulmonary Fibrosis
  From the time of admission [**2158-10-2**] until [**2158-10-4**], Mr [**Known lastname **] was
supported in the Medical ICU.  He was maintained and
subsequently weaned from 50% by face mask, down to 6L by nasal
cannulae at the time of transfer to the floor.  This will likely
be his new oxygen requirement at home.  High dose steroids were
started (1g Solu-Medrol per d, IV divided into 250 mg QID) and
continued for three days. He is to be discharged on a taper
starting at 100 mg PO prednisone daily.
  On CT, this pulmonary fibrosis appears to have progressed
since [**Month (only) 205**] (when it was diagnosed).  Unfortunately, he is no
longer eligible for transplant given carcinoma positive bladder
biopsy in [**2155**].

Hypoxemia
  This is suspected to be from acute exacerbation of pulmonary
fibrosis as he had no evidence of underlying infection or left
heart failure.  He was continued on acetylcysteine, Advair for
symbicort, and spiriva.  Echo cardiography was also performed
(see above).  Right heart cath was considered but not performe
