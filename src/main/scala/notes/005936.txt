Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 14788**] was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in resp distress. She had a
repeat witnessed aspiration event in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Her initial CXR was
unremarkable despite having diffuse rhonchi on exam along with a
moderate oxygen requirement. She was started on BiPAP. along
with Steroids, Levofloxacin, and Nebs (Alb/Atr) for a
presumptive COPD flair given her lack of CXR findings (despite
no smoking hx). She then had slight improvement in her
respiratory status. However, the patient's respitory status
worsened and a follow-up CXR showed a RLL infiltrate. She also
had epidodes of atrial fibrilliation, initially managed with
Diltiazem, which often resulted in hypotension, which was
subsequently managed with IVF.

After discussions with the family, facilitated by the [**Hospital 153**]
medical team, the patient's BiPAP was changed to face mask O2
when the decision was made to make the patient CMO given her
poor prognosis. After the CMO decision was made, no further IVF,
antibiotics, or steroid therapies were pursued. She was given
supplemental O2 and pain management (Morphine and Ativan) to
focus on the patient's comfort. She was seen and followed by
Palliative Care and finally discharged to with a focus on
hospice care.
