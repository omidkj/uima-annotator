[**2118-4-29**] CTA chest - IMPRESSION:
1. Consolidative process within the right lower lobe consistent
with atelectasis vs pneumonia. Within this region there is a 1.4
cm hyperattenuating focus of unsure etiology seperate from the
identified vasculature. The appearence is not typical of a AVM
although if blood pressure drop observed a urgent Chest CT is
warrented. Close interval follow up of this region is warrented.
2. New moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
3. Scattered mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, the largest
measuring 1.1 cm in short axis.
4. Small pericardial effusion.

[**2118-5-6**] CT Chest - IMPRESSION:
1. Overall slight decrease in size of moderate loculated right
pleural fluid collection following placement of right-sided
chest tube. A pigtail pleural catheter also remains in place.
2. Although majority of pleural fluid is simple in appearance, a
high attenuation focus may represent a hemorrhagic component as
discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] by telephone on the date of the study.
3. Atelectatic changes in the right middle and lower lobes
adjacent to effusion. Underlying infectious consolidation is not
excluded.
4. Slight decrease in small pericardial effusion.
5. Loculated gas collections within right pleural fluids, which
are likely related to recent intervention with chest tube and
pigtail catheter in place.5. Moderate degenerative changes
within the thoracic spine.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 67 yo M with a history of diabetes and hypertension who
presented with hemoptysis and was found to have community
acquired pneumonia with effusion. He initially was given
levofloxacin that was changed early on to Zosyn/azithromycin but
CXR showed pleural effusion. Bedside thoracentesis was attempted
but unsuccessful. A CT guided thoracentesis was done on [**5-2**] and
fluid was exudative. Pleural fluid continued to accumulate and a
chest tube was placed by IP and had intermittent drainage.
However on [**5-4**] he was found to be somnolent and in respiratory
distress after receiving 8mg morphine and 2 mg dilaudid for pain
at the chest tube site. He required narcan and a transfer to the
ICU. While in the ICU he was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
The Vanc was discontinued but the patient had persistent
effusions and a VATS was done on [**5-9**]. He was extubated a few
hours after the procedure and has done well since then (except
for brief hypotension while on the propofol gtt in the MICU).
He was restarted on Vancomycin on [**5-10**] as the pleural fluid from
the VATS was again G+ cocci and there was a concern in the ICU
for MRSA.

PNA: RLL community acquired pneumonia.  Little evidence for
aspiration based on history.  Pt started on levofloxacin and
then changed to Zosyn/azithromycin.  Vanc was later added given
persistent parapneumonic effusion growing gram (+) cocci.  Pt
required supplemental O2.   Improved oxygenation and was able to
wean 02.  Had no symptoms at time of discharge. Was changed to
cefpodoxime given fluid did not grow resistant organisms.

MS changes: Patient was noted to have mental status changes but
this occured in the setting of morphine and dilaudid and the
transfer to the ICU.  Once he was out of the ICU his mental
status was signficantly improved and appeared to be near his
baseline at the time of discharge.

Parapneumonic effusion: Loculated/complex effusion likely
parapneumonic.  Did not clear with thoracentesis; thus, chest
tube placed by thoracic surgery on [**2118-5-4**].  CT showed persistent
effusion w/ loculated regions not being drained by chest tube.
Because of this, pt taken for VATS with decortication.  A second
chest tube was placed at that time.  Pleural fluid growing gram
positive cocci.  Antibiotics broadened to vanc/zosyn to cover
for possible MRSA.   However, narrowed on [**5-12**] to only
vancomycin.  Pleural fluid grew coag negative staph and was
changed to cefpodoxime on discharge

Respiratory distress: Now resolved. pt experienced an episode of
acute respiratory distress with hypoxia and mental status
changes in the setting of over sedation from narcotics.
Symptoms resolved as narcotics wore off.

Hemoptysis: Likely due to CAP. No risk factors for TB. No
evidence of PE on CTA. No evidence of malignancy. No
coagulopathy. Cardiac etiology unlikely.  Resolving.

 Small pericardial effusion. No evidence of tamponade.  Should
have outpatient follow up.

HTN. relatively well controlled on home regimen, which was
continued.
.
Diabetes mellitus: He was continued outpatient regimen of HISS
and glargine was started.  He was also continued on Januvia
(outpatient medication) and his glucoses were better controlled.
 However, patient should be transitioned to an all insulin
regimen for now.  He continued to have elevated glucoses and
therefore was sent home with an insulin regimen.  He and his
daughter were given extensive instructions regarding this
regimen from several members of the staff.  His daughter and Mr.
[**Known lastname 109307**] expressed understanding.

Renal failure. Baseline CRI with crt 1.2-1.8.  Pt w/ recent
proteinuria--possibly diabetic nephropathy.  Improved to
baseline.

Dark stool. [**Month (only) 116**] be due to patient swallowing hemoptysis. No
concern for GI bleed at this time.  Guaiac all stools.
Outpatient colonoscopy

Orthostatic hypotension. No active issues.  Continued
fludrocortisone
