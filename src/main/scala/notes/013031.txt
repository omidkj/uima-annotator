DATE OF DEATH:  [**2133-3-30**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
male with AML, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension.
He was recently discharged on [**2133-3-20**] after a 2-week
admission for bacteremia secondary to infected Hickman line
with coag-negative Staph.  Bronchoscopy on [**2133-3-12**] showed a
BAL negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 18617**] culture, and Aspergillus.  Also
during his admission, he had negative histo, negative crypto,
and negative CMV.  Since his discharge, the patient was seen
in clinic on [**2133-3-23**] and received 2 units of packed red
blood cells and 1 platelets.  Seen again on [**2133-3-25**] and
reportedly continued to have night sweats and fevers, which
was attributed to his underlying cancer.  His saturations
were 89 percent on room air, and he was given 2 liters of
oxygen.

The patient presented to the emergency department today for
cough, fatigue, shortness of breath x6 days, with chest pain
x1 today.  While in the ED, he was found to have a chest x-
ray consistent with increased bilateral infiltrates and
oxygen requirements (92 percent on 10 liters).  The patient
was given 1 unit of packed red blood cells and decompensated
from a respiratory standpoint.  He was intubated and sent to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He was also given cefepime 2 g IV x1, clindamycin,
Lasix 80 mg prior to transfer.  The patient was unable to
provide history, and sister reports 6 days of increased
shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, cough with
sputum, chronic fevers, emesis x 1 day ago.  He was contact[**Name (NI) **]
by his oncologist at home today, encouraged the patient to go
to the Emergency Department for evaluation of his chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  MDS converted to AML (M6 versus
erythroid) in [**3-14**], induction 7 plus 3 in [**5-14**], HIDAC
complicated by neurotoxicity in [**8-14**].

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on anticoagulation.

Obesity.

Hypertension.

History of DVT in the left lower extremity in [**2095**] after a
fracture.

TTE in [**2-11**] with EF 60 percent, left atrial and right atrial
enlargement, 3 plus MR, 1 plus AR.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Folate 1 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. indefinitely.
4. Voriconazole 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. indefinitely.
5. Compazine 10 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, retired businessman, smokes 40-pack-
year history, quit in [**2125**], significant alcohol use, no IV
drug abuse.  He is a Latvian immigrant.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father who died of colon cancer at age 87,
mother with atrial fibrillation, sibling with non-Hodgkin
lymphoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 104 degrees, blood
pressure 101/53, pulse 91, saturations 98 percent on the
ventilator settings of AC 750 tidal volume with a respiratory
rate of 20, FiO2 of 100 percent, PEEP of 10.  In general, the
patient was then intubated, breathing comfortably on the
ventilator.  HEENT:  Pupils constricted, anicteric, moist
mucous membranes.  OG tube in place.  Neck:  Unable to
appreciate JVD.  Chest:  Diffuse rales and upper airway
sounds bilaterally with occasional expiratory wheeze.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and
S2, laterally displaced PMI.  Abdomen:  Distended, nontender,
with good bowel sounds, enlarged liver 3 cm below the costal
margin.  Extremities:  2 to 3 plus pitting edema bilaterally
lower extremities to the knees.  Neurological:  Unresponsive,
sedated, no spontaneous movements.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 2.6 with a
differential of 29 percent neutrophils, 13 percent bands, 47
percent lymphocytes, 12 percent monocytes, 5 percent blasts,
hematocrit 22.7, platelets 101,000.  INR 3.  Chem-7 was
remarkable for a potassium of 5.8, bicarbonate of 17, and a
creatinine of 1.4, baseline 1.0.  Phosphorus of 5.3.  ANC on
[**2133-3-27**] was 550.  Fibrinogen and D-dimer were pending.
Troponin was less than 0.01 x2.  Albumin of 3.9, ALT 13, AST
33, LDH 757, alkaline phosphatase 67, total bilirubin 1.2,
amylase 73.  Blood cultures pending.  Blood cultures from
[**3-23**] showed no growth to date.  Lactate was 7.5 and then
3.9.  ABG was 7.38, 33, 84, on 10 liters.  Chest x-ray at 2
o'clock showed cardiomegaly, interval development of
bibasilar and perihilar infiltrates.  Chest x-ray later on
showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent
with ARDS, cardiomegaly, ETT 3 to 4 cm above the costal
margin.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation, left axis deviation,
wide QRS with no T-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] changes.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 61-year-old male with acute
myelogenous leukemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and
hypertension recently admitted for fever and neutropenia,
found to have coagulase-negative Staph, bacteremia, and
Hickman line was pulled.  He continued to have temperature
spikes without a clear source.  He now returns with 6-day
increasing shortness of breath, fevers, and chest pain today.
His chest x-ray is consistent with acute respiratory distress
syndrome, and he is now intubated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Fevers.  The patient had a bilateral
diffuse pneumonia in an immunocompromised host.  The
differential includes CAP, atypical pneumonia, CMV, HSV,
influenza, parainfluenza, histo, crypto, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
Aspergillus.  His ANC is less than 1000.  He was covered
empirically with vancomycin, Flagyl, cefepime, and
voriconazole.  Blood and sputum cultures were checked.  The
patient had a very high PEEP requirement throughout his
hospitalization, and we were unable to bronchoscope the
patient.  He continued to have high fevers.

Respiratory failure.  Chest x-ray was consistent with
appearance of ARDS with high oxygen requirement on the
ventilator.  Subacute progression of symptoms started on home
oxygen 6 days ago.  This favors a fungal process.  The
patient had worsening PO2 on the night of admission despite
maximum ventilatory support, suggesting worsening ARDS.  PEEP
and total volumes now were limited by plateau pressures in
the 40s to 50s.  The patient was continued on ARDS ventilator
strategy with low tidal volumes, increased PEEP.  He was
given bicarbonate 1 ampule bolus and started on a bicarbonate
drip however, this also worsened his pulmonary edema.  He was
continued on his paralytics.  Unfortunately, the patient was
not able to maintain oxygenation even on maximum ventilatory
support.  His last gas was 7.25, 46, and 54, and he was
continuing to drop.  Hemodynamically, the patient was unable
to maintain his blood pressure.  He was started on pressors
and was on Levophed, niacin, and vasopressin with SVP still
in the 80s.  He was continued to be bolused with 0.5 normal
saline with bicarbonate, but his lactate continued to rise
and his urine output continued to decrease.  Eventually, the
patient expired on [**2133-3-30**] from respiratory failure.  The
patient also showed signs of coagulopathy with DIC and DIC
with INR of 3.0, platelets decreased to 5000 on admission,
hematocrit of 23.  Also had acute renal failure and a severe
metabolic acidosis with lactate continuing to rise.  The
patient's wife was not available initially on admission, but
the next day, his wife and sister were available.  His code
status initially was changed to CPR not indicated, and he had
a very poor prognosis with very little hope for survival,
which was communicated to his sister [**Name (NI) 4051**] and would be
discussed with the wife when she came later in the afternoon.
Later that afternoon, on [**3-30**] at 9:30 p.m., the patient's
family, wife, sister, and several other members met with the
administrator on the patient's bedside.  They changed the
patient's code status to comfort measures only and elected to
extubate the patient.  The patient was given a small bolus of
Fentanyl for comfort and then extubated to room air.  He died
within minutes of extubation, pronounced dead at 9:19 p.m. on
[**2133-3-30**].  Pupils w
