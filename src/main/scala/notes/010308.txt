Admission Date:  [**2137-11-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2137-11-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**2061-6-25**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU
The patient was transferred to the Medicine Service on
[**2137-11-14**], with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as attending.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was admitted with a chief
complaint of transfer from [**Hospital3 27946**] with a chronic
positive cardiac enzymes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The history was obtained from
medical records and family.  Per the family, the patient had
shortness of breath for two days prior to admission at
[**Hospital3 27946**].  She had increased cough over her
baseline.  She then presented to [**Hospital3 27946**] on
blood gases at that time was 7.20, pCO2 64, pO2 278, with a
respiratory rate of 32 and the patient then was intubated as
she began tiring.  She failed a trial of BiPAP prior to
intubation.

An electrocardiogram at that time then showed ST elevations
in V2 and a tachycardia to approximately 130 to 140 with a
changing P wave morphology.  Cardiac enzymes were positive
with a CK of 342, MB of 16.9 with an index of 4.9, and a
troponin I was 3.1.   Twenty-four hours later, CK was 500, MB
27.2, index 4.4 with troponin of 4.89.  The patient denied
any chest pain when she first presented to the Emergency
Department per the records.

Heparin was started at that time when she began ruling in and
then stopped secondary to guaiac positive stool.  The
tachycardia in the Emergency Department was initially
controlled with Diltiazem drip and the patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at the outside
hospital.

At that time, a right heart catheterization was performed
with pulmonary artery pressures of 34/16, pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 11, cardiac output of 4.68.  White blood
count was elevated at 20.8 and 8% bandemia.  A sputum gram
stain showed greater than 25 PMNs with 0-1 epithelial cells
and gram positive cocci in pairs.  Given the lack of
resolution of the cardiac enzymes and concern for acute
myocardial infarction, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.

respiratory rate status 16, SIMV with a PEEP of 5, FIO2 35%.

elderly woman who is sedated and comfortable.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  No scleral
icterus.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck - She has a right
IJ line without any hematoma or bruit.  The lungs are clear

and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops,
distant heart sounds.  Abdominal examination is soft,
nondistended, minimal right upper quadrant tenderness,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.  Dorsalis pedis 2+ bilaterally.  Neurologic
examination - she is sedated.  The pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  She withdraws to
pain.  She moves all four extremities.  Lines - She has a
right IJ and a right radial line.

DRIPS ON TRANSFER:  She is on a Nitroglycerin drip at 20
mcg/minute, Heparin drip and she is on a Propofol drip as
well.

LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation to the outside hospital,
white blood count 20.8, hematocrit 50.2, platelets 451,000
with 74 neutrophils, 8 bands.  INR 0.9, partial
thromboplastin time 29.3.  On [**2137-11-11**], white count 18.4,
hematocrit 42.8, platelets 283,000.  Also on [**2137-11-11**], she
had a SMA7 with sodium 142, potassium 4.1, chloride 109,
bicarbonate 26, blood urea nitrogen 22, creatinine 1.7,
glucose 173.  Urinalysis was negative at the outside
hospital.  Theophylline level was 7.3.

She had serial enzymes drawn.  On [**2137-11-10**], on presentation,
CK 342, MB 16.9, index 4.9, troponin 3.11.  Later on
[**2137-11-10**], CK 382, MB 18.3, index 4.8, troponin I 4.3.  On
[**2137-11-11**], CK 402, MB 18.7, index 4.7, troponin I 4.9. Later
on [**2137-11-11**], CK 500, MB 22.2, index 4.7, troponin I 4.9.

At [**Hospital1 69**], her pulmonary artery
pressure was 51/37, wedge 25, cardiac output 4.1, cardiac
index 2.11.

Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion, right lower lobe
infiltrate.  She had an endotracheal tube in place.  She had
a pulmonary artery line in place.  Electrocardiograms from
[**2137-11-10**], showed sinus tachycardia versus MAT, increased ST
in V2.  From [**2137-11-12**], at [**Hospital1 188**], no ST changes and she has diffuse T wave inversions.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 76 year old female most likely
bacterial pulmonary process leading to a chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare leading to MAT versus an
supraventricular tachycardia leading to cardiac ischemia.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit on the
CCU team.  Heparin, Aspirin, Lopressor will be continued.
Enzymes will be cycled.  She will be placed on telemetry and
echocardiogram will be obtained and plan for cardiac
catheterization in the morning.

1.  Pulmonary - Levofloxacin will be continued, ventilatory
support will be continued and weaned as tolerated,
Solu-Medrol intravenous 40 mg q6hours will be given for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.

2.  Renal - Creatinine 1.4, acute or chronic is the debate.
This will be followed.

3.  Infectious disease - The patient will be fully cultured
with every temperature spike.  Cultures from the outside
hospital will be followed and the patient will be continued
on Levofloxacin.

4.  Gastrointestinal - Heme positive stools - The patient
will be started on Protonix and stools will be guaiac tested
and serial hematocrit will be followed and the patient will
need an outpatient colonoscopy once she recovers from this
acute exacerbation.

CODE:  The patient is full code, and family contacts are as
above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By hospital day number two, cardiac enzymes
had trended down to normal.  Neurologic examination remained
normal and the right IJ line was changed over a wire.  Drips
were continued.

An echocardiogram was also obtained on the previous day that
showed mildly dilated left atrium and left ventricle with
mild to severe global hypokinesis, right ventricular wall
hypertrophied with normal function and 1+ mitral
regurgitation.  The creatinine trended down leaving only
cardiovascular and pulmonary as the active systems involved
at this time.

Also on hospital day number two, a cardiac catheterization
was performed that showed mild pulmonary artery hypertension
with elevated right atrial pressures, low normal ejection
fraction of the left ventricle, and coronary angiography
showed severely calcified right dominant system with mild
luminal irregularities.  No interventions were indicated or
taken.

On hospital day number three, Captopril was increased.  The
patient had a weaning trial and indicated her readiness for
extubation.  The patient was extubated without complications.
Later on hospital day three, [**2137-11-14**], the patient was
trans
