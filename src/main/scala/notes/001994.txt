HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old Russian-
speaking male with a history of coronary artery disease
(status post coronary artery bypass graft), type 2 diabetes,
and chronic renal failure who presents with two days of
extreme shortness of breath at rest and dull 7/10 chest pain
with radiation to the left shoulder.  Positive paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, two-pillow orthopnea, and positive
peripheral edema.  The patient has not had any change in his
medications or diet.  The patient saw his primary care
physician this morning and was noted to be hypoxic and was
sent to the Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, found to have evidence of
congestive heart failure and acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 3.2 (baseline of 2) and ST depressions in V2 to
V4 on electrocardiogram.  The patient was given aspirin and
started on a heparin drip.  He was given Plavix,
nitroglycerin, and morphine and is now pain free.  The
patient was also given one dose of Lasix with minimal
response.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
   bypass graft in [**2157**]; status post cardiac catheterization
   in [**2168-3-22**] at an outside hospital (no stents
   placed).
2. Type 2 diabetes with nephropathy; baseline creatinine of
   2.
3. Chronic renal failure.
4. Peripheral vascular disease with right leg
   revascularization.
5. Hyperlipidemia.
6. Back pain secondary to spinal stenosis.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lasix 20 mg once per day.
2. Atenolol 100 mg once per day.
3. Lisinopril 20 mg once per day.
4. Cardia 30 mg twice per day.
5. Lipitor 40 mg once per day.
6. Aspirin 81 mg.
7. Avandia 8 mg once per day.
8. Acarbose 25  three times per day.
9. Neurontin 300  three times per day.

11.      Nitroglycerin as needed.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Healthcare proxy is son.  [**Name (NI) **] alcohol,
tobacco, or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 97,
heart rate was 54, blood pressure was 118/91, breathing at
15, and 90 percent on a nonrebreather.  Generally, in no
acute distress.  No accessory muscle use.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed jugular venous pressure
elevated to the angle of the jaw.  The mucous membranes were
moist.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate
first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  Positive third
heart sound.  No murmurs.  The lungs with crackles two thirds
of the way up with diffuse wheezing.  Abdomen with positive
bowel sounds and nontender.  Mild distention, tympanitic to
percussion.  Lower extremities with 2 plus lower extremity
edema bilaterally.  Distal pulses were intact bilaterally.
Neurologically, alert.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Notable for
white count of 10.2, hematocrit was 32.5, and platelets were
161.  INR was 1.1.  Potassium elevated at 5.8, blood urea
nitrogen was 95, creatinine was 3.2, glucose was 352.
Creatine kinase elevated at 1030, MB was 15, and troponin was
0.85.  Urinalysis was negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed evidence
of congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema.

An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, normal
intervals, T wave inversions in V2 through V4, and ST
depressions in V2 through V4.  These were new changes
compared to prior examination.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 80-year-old male with coronary artery
disease (status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2157**])
here with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and acute
congestive heart failure with hypoxia requiring supplemental
oxygen.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:  The
   patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix, and statin.  The
   patient was started on a heparin drip and nitroglycerin
   drip.  Currently chest pain free.  The patient was
   ultimately weaned from the nitroglycerin drip.  Cardiac
   catheterization was considered.  The patient continued to
   be a good candidate cardiac catheterization; however,
   limited by poor renal function.  The patient was continued
   on aspirin, Plavix, statin, beta blocker, and ACE
   inhibitor.  His treatments were optimized during hospital
   course.  Ultimately, the patient did not receive a cardiac
   catheterization and will follow up  as an outpatient.

(b)  Pump:  The patient demonstrated an ejection fraction of
30 percent with multiple wall motion abnormalities.  ACE
inhibitor was restarted.  The patient was initially managed
on a Lasix drip for diuresis; however, was diuresing
adequately off the Lasix drip.  Current presentation thought
to be due to decompensated heart failure.  The patient was
started on spironolactone.  Medications were titrated to
optimize congestive heart failure.

(c)  Rhythm:  Remained stable on telemetry.

1. PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient with significant diuresis
   during the course of hospitalization but still required
   oxygen.  The patient was given nebulizers and incentive
   spirometry.  Upon optimization of cardiac regimen, the
   patient's oxygen requirement decreased, and oxygen
   saturations were stable on room air.

1. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  Thought to be likely due to
   congestive heart failure.  Initially, diabetic medications
   and ACE inhibitor were held; however, creatinine began to
   decrease with good diuresis, and ACE inhibitors and
   diabetic medications were reinitiated.  Creatinine had
   improved to better than baseline at the time of discharge.

1. TYPE 2 DIABETES ISSUES:  Initially started on a regular
   insulin sliding scale.  His sugars were elevated.  The
   patient was ultimately restarted on his home diabetic
   medications.

1. MENTAL STATUS ISSUES: The patient demonstrated multiple
   onsets of agitation and confusion thought to be secondary
   to a communication barrier.  The patient was initially
   given Haldol and placed in restraints for fear of harm to
   self.  Per primary care physician assistant, the patient
   was started on low-dose Zyprexa and given frequent
   reorientation.  Family members were present to help calm
   and orient the patient.  With initiation of his
   medication, the patient's mental status improved.  The
   patient remained calm.

1. FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was
   placed on a cardiac and diabetic diet.  His electrolytes
   were repleted as needed.

1. PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  Prophylaxis was with proton pump
   inhibitor and bowel regimen.

1. CODE STATUS ISSUES: The patient remained a full code.
