[**2164-8-16**]
TTE:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present
in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results prior to surgical
incision.
POST-BYPASS:
Biventricular systolic function remains preserved. There is a
well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. No aortic insufficiency is visualized. The MR remains
mild to moderate. The remaining study is unchanged compared to
prebypass

ECHO [**2164-8-31**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated, normally
functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis. Preserved global left
ventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed), the overall
findings are similar (image quality is better on the current
study, but remains suboptimal).

Chest CT [**2164-9-5**]
INDICATION: 80-year-old male status post aortic valve
replacement and
pacemaker placement. Followup evaluation of sternal dehiscence
and left
pleural effusion.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical CT scan of the chest was
obtained without
the administration of contrast. Axial reconstructions in
standard and lung
algorithm were performed. Coronal and sagittal reformations were
prepared.

COMPARISON: CT examinations dated [**2164-8-31**] and [**2164-8-25**].
Correlation with multiple prior radiographs, most recent dated
[**2164-9-4**].

FINDINGS: The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG,
aortic valve
replacement, and pacemaker placement. Again seen are seven
sternal wires, the
most inferior three no longer bridge the sternum, which is
separated to a
similar degree to the examination of [**2164-8-31**]. A fluid
collection
located at the level of the inferior sternum and inferior to the
sternum
measuring up to 4.5 x 2.6 cm (2:49), previously measured 4.5 x
2.8 cm, not
significantly changed. The extent and size of a loculated left
pleural
effusion is unchanged from the prior examination. Associated
atelectasis also
appears similar. Previously seen trace right pleural effusion is
essentially
resolved with residual atelectasis at the right base. No
pneumothorax is
seen. There are secretions within the trachea and right mainstem
bronchus.

There is trace pericardial effusion. Cardiomegaly is stable. The
pacemaker
lead in the right ventricle, mediastinal clips and appearance of
the aortic
valve are unchanged. There are coronary calcifications. Multiple
mediastinal
lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged.

The osseous structures appear unchanged with dehiscence of the
inferior
portion of the sternum and a 5 mm gap in the superior portion of
the sternum.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine include
marginal
osteophyte formation and vertebral body endplate irregularities.


Limited views of the upper abdomen show a hyperdensity in the
right upper
quadrant which is unchanged and may represent a surgical clip.

IMPRESSION:

1. Similar appearance of sternal dehiscence and size of adjacent
fluid
collection.

2. Unchanged loculated left pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis.

3. Essentially resolved small right pleural effusion with
residual
atelectasis at the right base.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Head CT [**2164-8-31**]
FINDINGS: The patient is intubated. There is no acute
intracranial
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or major vascular territorial
infarcts. The
prominent ventricles and sulci are similar in appearance and
compatible with
age-related involutional changes. There is no shift of normally
midline
structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
There is no
acute fracture. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
clear.
Moderate fluid pools in the posterior nasal passage, likely
retained secretion
back up from the cuff of
