History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive MS
[**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2143**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump
placment in '[**64**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**65**] [**1-8**] to chronic
respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who
presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her
nursing home.  According to notes from [**Hospital6 33**], the
pt was found at her nursing home yesterday ([**3-26**]) AM, shaking
her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed
seizure). She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 34**] ED.
.
In the ED at [**Name (NI) 34**], pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR
12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB. Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the
ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV
ventilation. Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin,
Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir. On exam, it was noted that
the skin overlying the baclofen pump (RUQ) appeared inflamed.
Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia
of 20%. U/A with 50-100 WBC, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. LP
was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys,
glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+
cocci. Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in [**3-9**] bottles. Micro
lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was
positive for group B strep. Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and
ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given. Hydrocortisone 80mg was also
given. Left SC line and NGT were also placed at [**Hospital1 34**]. CXR showed
cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT was negative for an
abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. Head CT showed
questionable changes from prior that might suggest the
possibility of a right MCA infarct. Pt was transferred directly
to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
1. Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt
was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for
spasticity
2. Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought [**1-8**] to
chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. Last
admitted [**Date range (3) 35**] for urosepsis
3. Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**3-/2162**], [**10/2166**] - admitted both times
requiring MICU stay, during '[**65**] admission trach was placed
because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**1-8**] to
respiratory weakness
1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**1-8**] to aspiration
4. COPD
5. HTN
6. Osteoporosis
7. Scarlet fever as a child
8.  Chronic constipation
9. Hx of sacral decubitus ulcer


Social History:
Social History: Pt is widowed. She has no children. She
currently lives in a nursing home. Has been there since '[**65**]? She
has no hx of smoking, EtOH, IVDU. Will call sister tomorrow for
more information.

Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
PE: VS P 123 BP 129/73 O2Sat 97% on mechanical vent FiO2 0.50,
550, 15/5
General: older white female being mech ventilated through
tracheostomy
HEENT: pupils equal and reactive to light bilaterally 5-->3mm,
MMM, trach site clean, attempted to bend pt's neck but remained
stiff, unclear if that was volitional
Chest: coarse breath sounds throughout
Cardiac: sinus tach nl s1, s2, no s3, s4, no murmur appreciated
Abd: soft, obese, distended +bowel sounds throughout; in RUQ,
can appreciate outline of intrathecal baclofen pump, overlying
skin appears mildly erythematous, feels warm to touch, but then
again she feels warm to touch over the rest of her abdomen,
erythema appears localized to skin overlying pump, no streaking.
Ext: cool feet, faint DPs, legs appear thin and wizened.
Neuro: Brisk reflexes RLE, unable to elicit on left side. Pt
with Babinski bilaterally. Withdraws occasionally to noxious
stimuli. Does not respond to verbal stimuli.

TTE on admission:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. No obvious mass or vegetation seen.
.
CT abd post-op:
1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper
quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal
wall. No extension into the peritoneal space is seen. The
covering intern was notified by telephone at 10:30 a.m. on [**3-28**], [**2171**].

2) Gallbladder with dense material . this could represent
stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. If
clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further
characterization.

3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.

4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases.
.
EEG [**2172-3-28**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the

presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized
slowing
followed by periods of suppression. In addition, there were
independent
bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. This finding suggests deep,
midline
subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe
encephalopathy.
A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of
the encephalopathy.
.
EEG [**2172-3-31**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage
II sleep
with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of
intermittent and
independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both
sides.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and
is
consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. In
addition,
exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the
underlying
infection.
.
MRI [**4-4**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be
due to cellular debris from meningitis. No evidence of acute
infarct seen. Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild
communicating hydrocephalus.
.
MRV [**4-4**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the
superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of
thrombosis. Deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow
signal.
.
MRA [**4-4**]: Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion. No
evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
