Service:  TRANSPLANT SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old male with
coronary artery disease status post CABG, and status post
cadaveric renal transplant in [**2190-1-4**], complicated by
delayed graft function.  He was admitted to [**Hospital6 3426**] with presyncope and complete heart block with the
heart rate in the 20s and blood pressure in the 60s/palp.
Temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed at [**Hospital6 3426**], and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
after initial treatment for hyperkalemia of 8.3.  With
correction of his hyperkalemia, his heart block reversed, his
sodium corrected, and his hyperglycemia also came into much
better range.

He was admitted initially at [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**3-10**] to the Cardiac Care Unit for management of the
temporary pacer.  He was managed there for 2 days, but once
he was stabilized, the temporary pacing wires were removed,
and it was determined that his heart block was completely due
to various medications, namely Diovan, bactrim and Prograf
interactions, and that he was not in need of a permanent
pacer.

He was transferred to the transplant team once he arrived on
the floor, and the remaining week of his stay was spent
stabilizing his blood sugar regimen and his antihypertensive
regimen.
