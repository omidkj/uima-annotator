HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year old
male with end stage renal disease, status post living related
renal transplant which had failed in the past, presenting for
cadaveric renal transplantation.  The patient reports
excellent health until the age of 17 when he developed
appendicitis with rupture and incidental finding of nephrotic
syndrome, treated medically with Prednisone and managed
chronic renal insufficiency until end stage renal disease
requiring hemodialysis at age 32.  He was on hemodialysis
times twelve months until receiving renal transplant from
brother, 100 percent match.  Graft lasted four years and
resumed hemodialysis for the past five years until the
patient was now able to have a cadaveric renal transplant.

2. Hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient on admission had a blood
pressure of 167/74, heart rate 77, temperature 98.4,
respiratory rate 16, and oxygen saturation 97 percent in room
air.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat examination was normocephalic and atraumatic.

and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities were

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient was a 44 year old
male with end stage renal disease secondary to
glomerulonephritis with a past history of failed living
related renal transplant, presenting for cadaveric renal
transplant.  The patient was taken to the operating room for
cadaveric renal transplantation on [**2121-5-27**].  For operative
details, please see operative note.  Postoperative course was
complicated by delayed graft function.  The patient was not
making much urine throughout postoperative day one through
six.  On postoperative day six, the patient was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit for increasing pCO2 and decreasing
saturation rates.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient responded to Narcan times two and all narcotics were
stopped.  Renal continued to follow the patient.  The patient
through his hospital course was dialyzed three times.  The
patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit after
saturation rate began to improve on postoperative day seven
and the patient continued to have decreasing saturations
while on the floor.  Pulmonary medicine was called for
consultation and the patient was bronchoscoped for CT scan
findings of ground glass appearance of bilateral upper lobes,
right middle lobe and also persistent consolidation in the
right lower lobe.  Bronchoscopy was clean and the patient
began to auto diurese postoperative day eight and saturation
rates increased in room air.  The patient's postoperative
course was also complicated by left leg numbness and pain
starting postoperative day one for which neurology saw the
patient and attributed it to femoral cutaneous nerve damage
which was reversible and would take time to reverse.  This
pain got better as hospital course moved on and physical
therapy was continuing to see the patient throughout hospital
course.  The patient was discharged on [**2121-6-7**], with home
physical therapy.
