History of Present Illness:
mr. [**Known lastname 26802**] is a 78-year-old man with history of hypertension,
AS s/p AVR, atrial fibrillation/ flutter, CHF, s/p CVA, and
gastric cancer which was found on upper endoscopy.It has been
staged as having a resectable lesion which is T2 lesion.
No obvious nodes wereseen on endoscopic ultrasound, and
metastatic survey was
negative for distal disease. A lesion was seen in his skull

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
ESOPHAGUS  [**2190-11-22**] 2:19 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old man s/p total gastrectomy with concern regarding the
esophago-jejunal anastomosis
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for leak or obstruction at anastomotic site.
2. Mild amount of free esophageal reflux.\
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2190-11-23**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
aortic valve leaflets are thickened. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is
probably present. Mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 96777**] operative course was uncomplicated. He was routinely
observed in the PACU. He was admitted to SICU from PACU for pain
issues, hypotension, & fluid requirement postoperatively.
.
Pain:He had an epidural place intra-op. He became hypotensive in
PACU. On [**11-18**]: He was switched to Epidural Demerol 1mg/mg @
12cc/h with some relief. His pain continued be unmanaged. On
[**11-19**]: His BP became more stable with IV resuscitation, he was
switched back to the APS 10 solution. On [**11-20**]: He continued
with the APS 10 solution at 4-8cc/h. He began to hallucinate.
The APS team was aware, and Geriatric Team was consulted. He is
currently well managed with oxycodone elixir and PO Tylenol. He
is currently rating his pain [**2193-3-7**].
.
[**Female First Name (un) **]: He was evaluated per team on [**2190-11-22**]. Per [**Female First Name (un) 1634**] exam, he
was difficult to arouse, but able to answer some questions. He
denied pain anywhere. Tylenol was orderd around the clock
because he was not able to verbalize pain due to delirium.
Oxycodone use was minimized due to opiate sensitivity, and
Haldol order was minimized. A [**1-4**] sitter vs pharmacologic
measures was recommended as well. These recommendations were
initiated, and his mental status cleared significantly.
.
NUT: He was evaluated per Nutrition in the ICU, and followed
once transferred to surgical unit. He was started on Tube feeds
via the JTUBE in the ICU. The rate was advanced slowly as his
bowel function and cognitive function cleared. He was advanced
to his goal rate. He is currently being fed with 3/4 str impact
with fiber at 120cc/h x 12 hours. In addition, he is tolerating
small frequent meals, regular food with Ensure supplements. His
blood sugars were checked QAC&HS. He was treated with Regular
insulin per sliding scale. His bloods sugars were stable during
