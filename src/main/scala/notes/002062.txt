CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34 year old man
with history of obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension who
presented with sudden onset coughing fit and syncope and was
found to have bilateral massive pulmonary embolism by CT
angiogram.  The patient had noted some shortness of breath
and pallor with exercise starting in [**2195-4-2**].  During the
summer, the patient noticed that he was short of breath after
climbing stairs.

In [**Month (only) **], the patient was diagnosed with question of lung
disease and given Albuterol.  The patient's dyspnea
progressed and he was started on Pulmicort with some response
on pulmonary function tests.  A few days before presentation,
the patient called his doctor [**First Name (Titles) 1023**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2875**] the patient with
a Prednisone burst treatment without success. The patient was
at home and dyspneic with minimal activity.  The patient had
a chest CT on [**2196-1-29**].  It was noncontrast which was read as
normal.

The day before presentation the patient had a coughing fit
with witnessed syncope.  The patient denies any hemoptysis.
He admitted to fifteen pound weight loss over the last few
months.  The patient had been on a 24 hour nonstop trip to
[**State 108**] since [**Month (only) **].  The patient denied any family
history of clots or personal history of clots.  No recent
trauma and no recent surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP.
3.  Tonsillectomy.
4.  Question of asthma.
5.  History of echocardiogram that revealed mild decreased
left ventricular function.
6.  History of dyspnea on exertion since [**2195-4-2**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Univasc.
2.  Prilosec.
3.  Prednisone.
4.  Multivitamin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a computer networker.
He is married with three children.  The patient denies any
tobacco or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for rheumatoid arthritis and
leukemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a blood pressure of
115/70 with a pulse of 118.  Respiratory rate was 20 with
oxygen saturation of 100% on two liters.  Generally the
patient was a fairly ill appearing man in no apparent
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
revealed extraocular movements intact.  The pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  On neck
examination, jugular venous distention was approximately six
centimeters of water.  On cardiac examination, the patient
was tachycardic with normal S1 and S2 and a III/VI blowing
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border and left
lower sternal border.  There were no lifts or heaves
appreciated.  Pulmonary examination revealed lungs that were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdominal examination
revealed the belly to be soft, nontender, nondistended with
no hepatosplenomegaly.  Rectal examination was negative.
Extremity examination revealed no edema although there were
decreased pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
16.0 with a hematocrit of 44.5.  The patient had a blood urea
nitrogen of 18 and creatinine of 1.0.  The patient's INR was
1.2.  The patient had initial CK of 134, CK MB of 7.0 and
troponin of less than 0.3.

Chest x-ray was read as normal.  Chest CT angiogram revealed
bilateral pulmonary emboli that were extensive but without
saddle emboli.  Lower extremity ultrasound revealed left
distal superficial femoral to popliteal vein clot.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 34 year old with a history
of obstructive sleep apnea, reversible airway disease on
pulmonary function tests, and dyspnea on exertion for six
months who presented with extensive bilateral pulmonary
emboli.

1.  Cardiovascular - The patient with extensive pulmonary
emboli with evidence of right ventricular dilatation and
strain on an echocardiogram.  Because of the patient's stable
hemodynamics, he did not receive thrombolytics but was rather
started on Heparin infusion after a bolus.  Workup of
hypercoagulable states were started in the Intensive Care
Unit where the patient was admitted.

The patient had protein C and S, antithrombin III, factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**], prothrombin gene mutation 202-10 analysis,
homocysteine level, antiphospholipid antibody,
anticardiolipin antibody studies sent.

The patient was provided with supplemental oxygen.  He was
maintained on therapeutic level Heparin.  The patient was
stabilized and eventually transferred to the floor.  He was
started on Coumadin 5 mg p.o. for the first day and then this
was increased to Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. for the next two days.

The patient was monitored on telemetry.  The patient had
occasional episodes of ventricular bigeminy and premature
ventricular contractions but otherwise remained in sinus
rhythm.  His homocysteine level returned within normal
limits.
On the day of discharge, the patient had a therapeutic INR of
2.6.  He was discharged on Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. with INR
followed by his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 4127**].

2.  Hematologic - The patient with decreased hematocrit from
42.0 to 37.0 while in the Intensive Care Unit.  He was guaiac
negative and this was thought to be secondary to dilution.
His hematocrit remained stable throughout the rest of the
hospital stay.

3.  Pulmonary - The patient with obstructive sleep apnea on
CPAP.  He was maintained on CPAP throughout the
hospitalization and was gradually weaned off supplemental
oxygen to the point where he was saturating 98% in room air.

4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient presented with history of
elevated liver function tests.  The patient remained with
elevated liver function tests throughout the hospitalization.
His ALT was 112 on the day of discharge and AST was 62.  He
will likely need to have these followed up by his primary
care physician.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Excellent.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

The patient was advised to follow-up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 4127**] in one week.  The patient
will have INR checked a location close to him with results
faxed to his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient will be
referred to the hypercoagulation clinic at [**Hospital1 346**].  He was advised to call to make an
appointment at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5245**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli.
2.  Possible hypercoagulable state.
3.  Mild hypertension.
4.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
5.  Question of asthma.
