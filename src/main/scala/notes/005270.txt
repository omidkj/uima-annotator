Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**]
Chief Complaint:
unsteady gait, recent fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bilateral subdural burr hole for hemorrhage evacuation

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 y/o gentleman w/ history of a significant fall
with head trauma dating back to [**8-29**]. Since a few weeks after
this fall he states he has felt "wobbly."  He states he doesn't
feel steady on his feet while he walks, not because of weakness
but because he feels his balance is "off."

About 9 days prior to this admission, he fell again.  For the
past three days he has had a headache. A CT scan at the [**Location (un) 86**]
VA showed chronic bilateral large (1.6 cm at greatest thickness)
subdural hematomas, no midline shift.

He was originally admitted here to neurogsurgery service for
drainage of the subdurals. He was transferred to medicine
following bilateral burr holes. His hospital course has been
complicated by decompensated heart failure, delerium,
hypoxia/hypercarbia resp distress requiring a transient MICU
stay (not intubated).

History is obtained via pt's daughter as he is unable to give a
history. He has been noted be more confused and somnolent over
the past 1-2 days, and has had some loose stools. The pt says
"yes" when asked if he has a cough, but cannot give more details
& denies other complaints. Pt was recently treated for a UTI
with unknown antibiotic.

Imaging:
[**2119-8-5**] CTA of chest- No PE. Mildy enlarged pretracheal,
paratracheal, prevascular, precarinal, and subcarinal lymph
nodes are identified, the largest of these measuring 1.6 cm in
diameter. This finding may be reactive, but correlation with
patient's history of malignancy is recommended.  Increased
diameter of the main pulmonary artery, suggesting underlying
pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mild-to-moderate congestive
heart failure pattern. Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with
associated atelectatic changes
[**2119-8-4**] CXR - Persistent right-sided pleural and parenchymal
opacities, which could potentially be due to chronic scarring,
although an acute process is not excluded without more remote
radiographs for comparison.  No significant change since
earliest chest x-ray at this institution performed 5 days
earlier.
[**2119-8-3**] CXR - Interval increase in pulmonary interstitial edema
reflecting likely worsening CHF.  Left lower lobe consolidation,
which could be atelectasis or developing pneumonia. No
pneumothorax.
[**2119-8-3**] CT Head - Slight increase in size of extraaxial fluid
collection since prior study.  There has been some reduction in
the degree of pneumocephalus.
[**2119-8-1**] ECHO - Preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.  Dilated ascending aorta. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2119-7-30**] CXR - Probable right effusion which may be chronic.  No
other evidence for failure.
[**2119-7-28**] CT Head - Large bilateral subdural hematomas, causing
significant local mass effect on the brain parenchyma.  Old
studies are not available to assess for interval change, and
there does not appear to be an appreciable hyperdense component
to suggest an acute re-hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old male admitted on [**2119-7-28**] for evacuation of chronic
subdural hematomas, transferred to the MICU on [**2119-8-3**] ago for
respiratory distress found to have pulmonary edema and
presumptively treating for aspiration PNA.
.
1.  Subdural Hematomas: Pt was admitted to Neurosurgery on
[**2119-7-28**] for evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas.  He did
well on post-operative days 1 through 3, remaining awake, alert,
conversive and moving all extremeties.  He was then transferred
to medicine with hypoxia. Repeat CT after hematoma evacuation
showed slight increase in size of extraaxial fluid collection
and some reduction in the degree of pneumocephalus.  Pt's mental
status returned to his baseline and stayed stable neurologically
on medicine wards. Please, call Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**]
and set up a date for CT of head and follow up appointment with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**3-1**] weeks.
.
2. Hypoxia: On POD#3, pt had an increasing oxygen requirement,
increasing from 2L to 4L to BiPAP.  Pt's ABG initially
7.26/58/57, then 7.30/55/96 on 4L NC.  Pt was then transferred
to the MICU for hypercarbia resp failure and hypoxia.  He was
thought to have an aspiration pneumonia vs CHF.  A CTA of chest
was negative for PE and showed on ground glass consistent with
CHF.  CTA of chest also showed mildy enlarged pretracheal,
paratracheal, prevascular, precarinal, and subcarinal lymph
nodes are identified, the largest of these measuring 1.6 cm in
diameter. This finding may be reactive, but correlation with
patient's history of malignancy is recommended. He was started
on Levo/Flagyl but was switched to ceftriaxone/flagyl when the
coverage was deemed inadequate.  His volume statu
