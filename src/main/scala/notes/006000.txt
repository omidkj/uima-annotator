Pertinent Results:
Cath [**6-7**]: 1. Two vessel coronary artery disease (LMCA 80%) 2.
Mild mitral regurgitation. 3. Moderate diastolic ventricular
dysfunction. 4. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction. 5. Right
femoral IABP.
Chest CT [**5-25**]: 1. Moderately large pulmonary embolism extending
into the superior segment of the right pulmonary artery, into
the distal branches.
2. Bilateral dense, posterior consolidations consistent with
aspiration
pneumonia. 3. Dense coronary artery calcifications. 4. Prominent
bilateral axillary and a single enlarged subcarinal lymph node.
5. Generalized edema within the subcutaneous soft tissues.
CXR [**6-14**]: No evidence of pneumothorax. Bilateral moderate-sized
pleural
effusions.
CXR [**6-6**]: There is continued mild congestive heart failure with
cardiomegaly and bilateral small pleural effusions. There is
continued bibasilar patchy atelectasis. The left subclavian IV
catheter remains in place.
[**5-24**]: 1)Endotracheal tube 6.2 cm above the carina. 2) Bilateral

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, this is a 74 yr old with relatively
unremarkable past medical history who went into V.Fib arresst at
home and was shocked out of rhythm by EMS in field. After
stabilzation of pt. in the [**Name (NI) **], pt. found to have pumonary
embolism and ?pneumonia/increased WBC. He was started on Heparin
for the PE and abx for increased WBC. PNA. Pt. remained
intubated until [**6-5**] when he was successfully extubated. During
this time ([**Date range (1) 56879**]) pt was followed by medicine, cardiology,
nutrition, etc. and had numerous studies performed
(CXRs,CTs,Cultures-blood,urine,sputum,Echos,etc.). Finally on
[**2190-6-7**] pt underwent a cardiac cath which revealed severe LMCA
and mult. vessel disease. An IABP was placed and pt was
scheduled for a CABG the next day. On [**6-8**] pt was brought to the
OR and underwent a CABG x 3. Pt. tolerated the procedure well
with a total bypass time of 65 minutes and cross-clamp time of
54 minutes. Please see op note for full surgical details. Pt was
transferred to CSRU in stable condition with a MAP of 85, CVP
16, PAD 16, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 23, and HR 88 A-paced. He was being titrated on
Neo and propofol. Later on op day pt was weaned from mechanical
ventilation and propofol and was succesfully extubated. He was
awake, alert, mae, and following commands. POD #1 pt's IABP was
removed. Neo was weaned and diuretics and b-blockers were
started per protocol. He was started back on Heparin and
Coumadin. On POD #2 his chest tubes, epicardial pacing wires,
and foley catheter were all removed per protocol. POD #[**1-28**] pt
with ?aspiration. Speech study performed showed thin liquid
aspiration. Remained in the CSRU until POD#4 when he was
transferred to telemetry floor. Cont. to have course bs bilat.
Pt. encouraged to get OOB and ambulate. POD #[**4-30**] pt cont. to
progress slow d/t ambulation limitationa from polio. He was
cont. on Heparin and Coumadin for PE/A.Fib and Vanco for asp.
PNA. POD #7 pt was doing well, but needed transfer to Rehab
before going home. He was transferred there on heparin,
coumadin, and vanco. His physical exam was much improved with 1+
edema and irregular rate and heart rhythm. Appropriate follow-up
appointments were made.
