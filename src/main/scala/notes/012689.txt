Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:

Cardiac cath:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is >20
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis
and inferior akinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is mild global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 72391**] is a 86 year old woman who was admitted to
[**Hospital1 69**] on [**2199-3-11**] to the medicine
service for a work-up of chest pain and shortness of breath.  A
subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 70% LMCA, 70% LAD,
mid vessel LCx 70%, and a small diffusely diseased RCA with
50-8-% stenosis.  Cardiac surgery was consulted at this point.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed moderate aortic
stenosis.

After a plavix washout, Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 72392**] was taken to the operating
room  on [**2199-3-20**] and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting
times 4 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to SVG to Diag, and SVG to
acute marginal) and aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm CE
pericardial valve.  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **].  She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
in stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.

In the surgical intensive care unit the patient progressed well
and was extubated by post-operative day one.  She was weaned
from her pressors.  Ms. [**Known lastname 72391**] experienced post-operative atrial
fibrillation for which she was placed on an amiodarone drip.
She subsequently converted to normal sinus rhythm, but continued
to have short bouts of atrial fibrillation.  Her epicarial wires
and chest tubes were removed and she was transferred to the
floor.

On the floor, the patient's intensive pulmonary toilet regimen
was continued.  She was coumadinized for her paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.  At the time of discharge she had no atrial
fibrillation for twenty-four hours.  She was discharge to a
rehabiliation facility for continued pumonary toilet and
diuresis by post-operative day six.
