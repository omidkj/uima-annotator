Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old female with multiple medical problems, including CAD
status post CABG, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, with
multiple recent hospitalizations for different resistant
infections, including MSSE, MRSE and strep viridans bacteremia
thought to be secondary to decubitus ulcer with associated
osteomyelitis, presenting with sepsis.  She was agonal on
arrival to the MICU, with audible coarse breath sounds.  In
discussion with the family, they were clear about wanting to
keep her comfortable and NOT pursuing any further aggressive
treatments.  They understood that treatment would likely entail
continued pressors, possibly dialysis, intubation, etc, and they
understand that without these treatments, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] would
likely pass away relatively soon.  Given her deteriorated
quality of life, they opted for comfort measures, which were
pursued with the initiation of a morphine drip, and
discontinuation of levophed.  Within an hour of arrival to the
MICU she became apneic, her blood pressure dropped, and she
became bradycardic and then pulseless.  She was pronounced dead
at 4 p.m., an hour after arrival to the MICU.  Her family was in
the room, as was the Priest.
