History of Present Illness:
62 y/o man with PMH significant for sarcoidosis, HTN, and
hyperlipidemia admitted from the cath lab after treatment of a
ST elevation MI. Pt has been experiencing upper back pain for
approximately three weeks prior to admission. He attributed this
to muscle strain from moving in [**Month (only) 547**]. He had been treating this
at home with a heating pad, flexaril, and NSAIDs with relief of
the discomfort. However, on the evening of [**5-26**], the pain was
more severe over his bilateral shoulder blades and radiating
around on the left side. It was refractory to the treatments he
had been using for his back pain. The pt described it as a
"cramping". Significantly, the pain was associated with feelins
of weakness, nausea, and diaphoresis which was new for him. Pt
called EMS and when they arrived his BP was 107/75 with a HR of
80. He rated his pain a six at that time. He was transported to
[**Hospital3 934**] Hospital for further care. There he received
ASA, lopressor, nitro drip, heparin drip, and morphine. Cardiac
enzymes had not yet returned but ECG was concerning for
hyperacute T waves in V4 and a concern at the OSH for ST
elevation in V1-V3. Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further care. In the ED, the pt's VS were 98/64 ---> 117/80 80
20 100% 4L NC. ECG was very concerning with ST elevations in V3
and V4.
.
Pt was transferred to the cath lab for intervention. There, he
was found to have a 60% proximal ramus occlusion, 50% proximal
RCA occlusion, and a 100% proximal LAD occlusion. He had PCI to
the proximal LAD witha 3.5 by 2.8 cypher stent. Following the
stenting, the pt became hypotensive to the 80s with increased
CP. He then had a vagal episode with a decrease in his SBP to
the 60s and HR to the 40s. Pt was given atropine at that time
with good response. Then, there was placement of a balloon pump
and he was started on levophed. He also had transient worsening
of his CP. At that time, Pt's BP stabalized on this regimen and
he is currently CP free. He was transported to the CCU for
further care. Pt's hemodynamics were significant for a cardiac
output of [**5-15**] and an cardiac index of 2.67. Other measurements
included: PCW- 30; RA- 24.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the pt was pain free and not nauseated.
He reports that he has overall been feeling well at home except
for the intermittent back pain. He does not do much outside
exercise during cold weather as it adversely affects his
breathing with the sarcoidosis. However, he can walk several
blocks at baseline without difficulty. He denies any CP.


Past Medical History:
1. [**Name (NI) 66919**] Pt is on chronic prednisone for his sarcoidosis.
He rpeorts that he was diagnosed in [**2110**] and started on steroids
at that time. He has been on prednisone 5 mg daily for the past
couple of years.
2. Hypertension
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Psoriasis
5. S/P removal of nasal polyp on the right


Social History:

Pt is married and lives with his wife. They have three children.
The pt is retired from working as a [**Social Security Number 66920**]social security worker. No
ETOH, tobacco, or drugs. He has never smoked.


Family History:
[**Name (NI) 1094**] father had CHF and a MI in his early 60s. His mother had
lymphoma and angina in her 80s. His sister is 71 and was treated
for an unknown type of cancer three years ago.

L heart - right dominant system - 2VD
LAD - proximal TO after the takeoff from the left main. (no
collaterals)
Ramus - 60% lesion in the proximal portion
RCA - 40% lesion in the proximal portion
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated two vessel disease.  The LAD demonstrated a total
occlusion
in the proximal portion of the vessel just after the takeoff
from the
left main. Unfortunately there were no collaterals dupplying the
mid and
distal portion of the vessel.  The LCX was a small nondominant
vessel
with no significant disease.  The Ramus demonstrated a 60%
lesion in the
proximal portion of the vessel.  The RCA demonstrated a 40%
lesion in
the proximal portion of the vessel.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated
right
and left heart filling pressures (RA mean of 24 mm Hg; PCWP mean
of 30
mm Hg).  He also demonstrated moderately severe pulmonary
hypertension
with a PA pressure of 54/23 mm Hg.  The cardiac output/index
calculated
via the Fick method was 5.0 / 2.7 respectively.
3. LV ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LAD with a 3.5 x 28 mm
Cypher DES
(see PTCA comments).
5. Successful placement of an IABP.

[**2113-5-27**]: TTE: EF 20% - severe regional left ventricular systolic

dysfunction with near akinesis of the anterior septum, distal
2/3rds of the anterior wall, distal inferior wall, and apex. The
apex is mildly aneurysmal and descending aorta is dilated. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. 1+ AR.
