History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11622**] is a 27-year-old gentleman with a past medical
history significant for Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome, restrictive lung
disease from kyphoscoliosis, COPD/asthma, chronic ventilatory
insufficiency with hypercarbia on nocturnal ventilation and home
supplemental O2, and multiple admissions for Pseudomonal
pneumonia now admitted for increasing dyspnea with new
infiltrate on CXR.  The patient was noted to have increasing
shortness of breath, productive cough above baseline, O2
requirement up to 6L from 4L at baseline, and lethargy. He was
also observed to fall out of his wheelchair today onto his knee,
head, and elbow. He was then brought into the ED for further
evaluation.  He does state that his Brother has been ill for
several days with productive cough, fatigue, and sore throat for
which he was seen at another hospital yesterday.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS In 98.0 86 113/68 24 100% AC 400x20,
5, 0.4.  A CXR was concerning for new right base infiltrates. He
had negative plain films of his knee and elbow, and was admitted
to the MICU for further management. Of note, the patient was
most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxemic respiratory
distress found to have 2 non-fermenting (non-Pseudomonal) GNRs
and 1 isolate of Pseudomonas on min-BAL. At that time, he was
discharged to complete a 3 week course of ceftazadime and
tobramycin, with ID changing this regimen as an outpatient to
ceftazadime and levofloxacin based on sensitivities.  The
patient has also had multiple admissions for osteomyelitis and
pneumonia: [**Date range (1) 86067**] for sepsis and pneumonia treated with vanco
and meropenem, [**Date range (1) 68752**] for pneumonia with mini-BAL
demonstrating carbapenem and cefepime resistant Pseudomonas
trated with tobramycin and ceftazadime.

Past Medical History:
1. Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome (rare autosomal dominant congenital

bone resorption leading to osteoporosis, also known as type VI
idiopathic osteolysis)
2. Osteomyelitis, right olecranon (pressure-related)
3. Chronic obstructive/restrictive lung disease on home O2
during day and SIMV during the night
4. H/o multiple pneumonias, including Pseudomonas PNA and VAP
5. Right heart strain and pulmonary hypertension

Social History:
Patient lives at home with his grandparents and brother. [**Name (NI) **] a
Home Health Aide from 8am to 5pm daily. His Mother died in
[**Name (NI) 86065**]. Has been smoking [**5-16**] cigarettes per day, though no
cigarette use over past 5 days. Rare EtOH use. Denies illicit
drug use.

Family History:
Family History: Mother and brother with [**Location (un) 86059**] syndrome.

CXR [**2130-5-3**]:
INDICATION: A 27-year-old man with Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome,
presents with
shortness of breath, cough, and history of recent pneumonia.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2130-4-18**] FINDINGS: Single AP
supine chest radiograph was obtained. The study is extremely
limited due to significant chest wall deformity, associated with
S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis. Tracheostomy tube is in stable
position, terminating approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. New
patchy opacities in the right base are concerning for early
developing infection or aspiration.  No focal consolidation is
seen in the imaged portion of the left lung. The
cardiomediastinal contours are stable. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. IMPRESSION: New patchy right basal
opacities, concerning for early infection or aspiration.

RIGHT ELBOW PLAIN FILMS [**2130-5-3**]:
HISTORY: Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] syndrome. Apparent recent trauma from
fall. COMPARISON: [**2129-11-9**]. FINDINGS: There has been a
dramatic increase in the swelling and increased attenuation of
the soft tissue overlying the elbow along the dorsal aspect. The
profoundly osteopenic bones are identified. No gross fracture is
noted, although given the severity of the osteopenia, the
sensitivity for detecting subtle nondisplaced fracture is
limited. There is gross appropriate alignment. Please note a
true lateral view was not obtainable. IMPRESSION: Markedly
limited study. No gross fracture seen. However, given the
profound osteopenia, there is decreased sensitivity of the exam.
If clinical suspicion remains high, consider cross-sectional
imaging for more sensitive evaluation.

KNEE PLAIN FILMS [**2130-5-3**]:
FINDINGS: Additional review of the radiology database reveals
the patient has a diagnosis of Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] syndrome. LEFT KNEE:
Relative to the prior exams, the overall gross morphology of the
knee and proximal lower leg is stable with no overt changes. No
definite joint effusion is seen. Please note the profound
osteopenia significantly reduces the sensitivity for detecting
subtle nondisplaced fracture. Additionally, the positioning is
suboptimal. RIGHT KNEE: Positioning of the right knee is more
severely degraded than on the left. This renders the right knee
nearly nondiagnostic to exclude an underlying fracture,
particularly in light of no comparison study available.
IMPRESSION: Relative to a very recent prior, the left knee looks
grossly stable. The profound level of osteopenia renders the
exam nondiagnostic to exclude a subtle non-displaced fracture.
The limitations are more severe where the views acquired are
nondiagnostic to exclude even a displaced fracture. If clinical
suspicion remains high, consider MRI. Please note the severity
of osteopenia may render a CT scan nondiagnostic.

MRI RIGHT KNEE [**2130-5-6**]:
INDICATION: Assess for injury to right knee post fall from
wheelchair.
Patient has a history of Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] syndrome. TECHNIQUE:
Multiplaner localizer and axial proton density imaging was
performed. No further imaging could be performed as patient
could not tolerate exam.  FINDINGS: Very limited exam
consitisting of localizer sequence and motion degraded axial
PDFS sequence. On the localizer image (series 2, image 7), there
is apparent abnormal linear low signal intensity along the
supracondylar aspect of the distal femur, concerning for
fracture, with apparent minimal posterior angulation of the
distal component. There is marrow edema and adjacent soft tissue
edema at the distal femur. Some marrow edema is also seen at the
patella. There is a small knee joint effusion.  The
patellofemoral cartridge is also significantly thinned.  Growth
arrest lines are noted in the proximal tibia. IMPRESSION: Very
limited exam, but probable fracture of the distal femur,
supracondylar portion. CT could be performed to further assess.
