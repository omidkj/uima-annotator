Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint/Reason for Transfer:
transfer from SICU for ongoing management of respiratory
failure, renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**9-24**]: PICC placed, tunnelled HD line placed, trach and PEG

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40860**] is a 69 year old man with a history of obesity and
DM2 who was initially transferred to the SICU service from
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2179-9-10**] for Group A Strep septic shock and
copmartment syndrome.  Per the patient's chart, he fell at home
on [**2179-9-1**] (presumably with an injury to his left leg) with
persistent left leg pain.  On [**2179-9-4**], he began having fevers to
103.  On [**2179-9-7**], he was reportedly delirious in the setting of
ongoing fevers and was lying on the floor for several hours
unable to call EMS.  He was eventually taken to [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital by EMS on [**2179-9-7**] and noted to have swelling of his
left leg.  There, he had a leukocytosis to 18.4 with 58%
neutrophils and 39% bands, creatinine 1.5, lactate of 3.9, and
an anion gap of 15; he was also hypoxemic with a 3 L.min oxygen
requirement.  There, he was started on empiric
ampicillin/sulbactam and vancomycin for presumed cellulitis.
Plain films of his left leg showed no evidence of gas in his
soft tissues.  Blood cultures eventually grew pan-sensitive
group A Streptococcus.  On [**2179-9-8**], he was fiberoptically
intubated for mental status changes and also had transient
atrial fibrillation controlled with digoxin and beta blockade;
antibiotics were changes to penicillin and clindamycin.  On
[**2179-9-9**], he was taken to the OR for exploration of his left calf
and underwent fasciotomy; per the operative note, there was no
evidence of myonecrosis.  He experienced post-operative
hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and
vasopressors.  With this, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] SICU
service for ongoing care.
.
Of note, his CPK was 189 on admission to [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**9-7**] and
peaked at 3842 on [**9-8**].
.
Upon arrival, a right subclavian central line was placed for
access. He was noted to be in oliguric acute renal failure and
nephrology was consulted; they believed his renal failure to be
due to ischemic ATN in the setting of septic shock and was
started on CVVH.  He was seen by orthopedics who determined that
there was no evidence of compartment syndrome.  He came off of
norepinephrine late on the night of [**2179-9-10**].  He has had
persistent renal failure, however, requiring CVVH and has been
difficult to wean from the ventillator.  With this, he is now
being transferred to the MICU service for ongoing care.

Pertinent Results:
RUQ U/S ([**9-18**]): A limited bedside portal son[**Name (NI) **] was performed.
The liver
demonstrates no focal or textural abnormality. There is no
intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common
bile duct measures 4 mm. The
main portal vein demonstrates normal hepatopetal flow. The
gallbladder appears normal without wall thickening or stones. No
free fluid is identified in the right upper quadrant.
IMPRESSION: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of biliary obstruction or
cholecystitis.

Head CT +/- contrast ([**9-17**]): There is mild brain atrophy
identified. There is no midline shift, mass effect, or
hydrocephalus. Following contrast, no abnormal parenchymal,
vascular, or meningeal enhancement identified. Bone images are
unremarkable.  The partially visualized paranasal sinuses are
clear. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities or
abnormal enhancement seen.

CT Chest, Abd, Pelvis ([**9-17**]): 1. There is evidence of a 3.3 cm
mass at the lower pole of the right kidney concerning for renal
cell carcinoma. When the patient's condition permits, MRI of the
abdomen is recommended, to aid in characterization. 2. There is
atelectasis and scattered patchy opacities within the lung
parenchyma. Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 3. Stranding
in the pelvis near the sigmoid colon, without a definite focal
colonic abnormality. This finding is nonspecific. 4. Eleven-mm
calculus in the bladder.

LLE U/S ([**9-15**]): Transverse and sagittal son[**Name (NI) 493**] survey of the
area of interest in the left upper thigh was performed. There
was a mild amount of superficial subcutaneous edema without
focal fluid collections, abscesses or evidence of subcutaneous
air. Right thigh was interrogated for comparison and
demonstrated symmetric soft tissue appearance. IMPRESSION: No
evidence of subcutaneous air, fluid collection or abscesses in
the region of interest in the left upper thigh.

CXR AP ([**2179-9-12**]):
Comparison with [**2179-9-11**]. There is streaky bilateral density
consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. There is increased
density in the retrocardiac area consistent with atelectasis or
consolidation. Mediastinal structures are unchanged. The right
subclavian catheter, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and
left internal jugular line remain in place. There is no definite
interval change.
.
TTE ([**2179-9-11**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal for the
patient's body size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential.
.
Abdominal ultrasound ([**2179-9-10**]):
Normal hepatic texture and echogenicity without focal hepatic
lesions or masses. No cholelithiasis or evidence of acute
cholecystitis. There is mild gallbladder wall thickening
measuring up to 4 mm. Probable left renal parapelvic cyst, not
well seen on a technically limited evaluation. Splenomegaly,
spleen measuring 14 cm.
.
ECG ([**2179-9-10**]):
Sinus tachycardia at 108 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals,
borderline low voltage, no ST segment or T wave changes.
