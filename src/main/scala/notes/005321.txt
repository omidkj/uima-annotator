Admission Date:  [**2132-7-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2132-8-27**]


Service:

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Fecal adenocarcinoma.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Fecal adenocarcinoma.

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  Subtotal colectomy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a very pleasant
80-year-old gentleman with recurrent colon cancer, type 2
diabetes mellitus, status post a previous colectomy for colon
cancer.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient has a past medical
history significant for)
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Sigmoid colectomy.
4.  Pilonidal cyst removal.
5.  He also has a history of premature ventricular
contractions.
6.  History of coronary artery disease with an ejection
fraction of 35% but a negative stress test in [**2131-3-30**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His hospital prior to admission
included Glyburide, metformin, atenolol, and eyedrops.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history is significant for no alcohol
or tobacco.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Incidentally, review of systems was
significant for no respiratory or cardiac complaints.  He
also had no gastrointestinal complaints at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  His admission physical
examination revealed a well-developed 80-year-old gentleman
in no apparent distress.  He was afebrile with a heart rate
of 60, blood pressure was 165/42, heart rate was 20, and an
oxygen saturation of 99%.  On examination, he was alert and
oriented times three.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  The
abdomen was soft with no masses.  His extremities were warm
and well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was taken to
the operating room on [**2132-7-28**]; at which time and
uncomplicated subtotal colectomy was performed.  At that
time, he had four liters of crystalloid in and estimated
blood loss of approximately 200 cc.

The patient was hypertensive in the Postanesthesia Care Unit
and required a Nipride drip.  He also had ST changes on his
electrocardiogram requiring a rule out protocol for a
myocardial infarction.  It should also be noted that Mr.
[**Known lastname 95126**] has a history of coronary artery disease with an
ejection fraction of 35% but a negative stress test in
[**2131-1-30**].

The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit.  His hospital course was significant for postoperative
pneumonia.  The patient required reintubation in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  He developed sepsis associated with
that pneumonia and secondarily went on to develop acute renal
failure.

During his hospitalization he also required a Quinton
catheter in the right groin for hemodialysis.  He also had a
Swan-Ganz catheter for the first five days postoperatively to
assess his fluid status and manage his blood pressure
medications.

The patient also developed worsening premature ventricular
contractions during his hospitalization.  These were treated
with Lopressor.  During his Intensive Care Unit stay, he also
required multiple pressors during the initial 10 to 14 days
of his postoperative course.

His sputum cultures did reveal a Pseudomonas for which he was
treated appropriately with double antibiotic coverage.  Due
to his continued multifocal pneumonia, he did require several
bronchoscopies during his hospitalization.  These were done
by the Unit team, and the patient tolerated these procedures
well.  However, they did not significantly change his
respiratory status.

Postoperatively, the decision was made after approximately
three and a half weeks, when it was clear that the patient
was going to require a more extended of ventilatory weaning,
that the patient would require a tracheostomy.  In addition,
due to his failure wean off the ventilator and to be able to
become fully alert and oriented, it was felt that a feeding
tube should also be placed.   These were successfully placed
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on approximately postoperative
twenty.

The patient's acute renal failure did not improve after five
days, and as his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine continued
to rise, it was felt that he would require hemodialysis.  A
Quinton catheter was placed, and he did receive multiple
treatments of hemodialysis.  This was effective in reducing
the amount of edema in the patient's extremities which he had
required during his septicemia.

The patient's cardiac status was evaluated by the Cardiology
team, and he was felt to have multiple premature ventricular
contraction with a history of a primary first-degree AV
block.  Electrocardiogram also revealed a right bundle-branch
block.  However, the Cardiology Service felt that the patient
would not benefit from any antiarrhythmic medications.
However, he did remain on his metoprolol.  At times, he did
require nitroglycerin paste and a Nipride drip to control his
blood pressure.

On postoperative day 28, after constant communication with
the family during the previous four weeks of hospitalization,
a discussion was held with regard to permanent access for
hemodialysis given the patient's failure to resolve his acute
renal failure.  It was at this time that the family decided
to not have a permanent access placed.  In fact, their wish
to have the patient to be made comfortable in the unit
setting.

At this time, his fluid and treatment requirements were
discontinued, and the patient was treated with pain
medication as needed.  The patient developed respiratory
failure on postoperative day thirty after his ventilatory
support had been turned off; again, at the request of the
family.

The patient expired at 1:30 in the afternoon on postoperative
day thirty.  At that time, the family elected not to request
an autopsy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Adenocarcinoma of the cecum.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
5.  First-degree atrioventricular block.
6.  Acute renal failure.
7.  Hospital-acquired pneumonia.
