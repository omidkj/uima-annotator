Chief Complaint:
Scheduled pericardiocentesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
64 yr old woman has a history of COPD, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, PVD s/p left iliac stenting, and carotid artery
disease s/p bilateral carotid endarterectomies. She notes that
in [**8-/2114**] she developed a chest cold with productive cough of
yellow sputum which has continued since without resolution of
symptoms.  Furthermore, In [**10/2114**], she underwent a preop
screening for ENT surgery for vocal cord lesions and was noted
on EKG to have atrial fibrillation.  She was subsequently
started on coumadin and metoprolol. She was referred for a
nuclear stress test on [**2114-10-22**] given her worsening pulmonary
symptoms which was reportedly normal, and she subsequently had
an echocardiogram on [**2114-11-2**] which revealed EF >55%, moderately
dilated left atrium, lipomatous change to intra atrial septum,
normal valves, mild pulmonary hypertension and a large
pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade.  Given her
significant smoking history and recent cough, Chest CT was also
done to assess for malignancy in the setting of the effusion
which confirmed the large pericardial effusion but no evidence
of pulmonary mass. Fatty infiltration of the myocardium was also
noted, and she subsequently underwent cardiac MRI to assess for
arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia which again confirmed
large effusion but no ARVD.

She has since been referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a scheuduled
pericardiocentesis for her pericardal effusion which she
underwent today with removal of 600 mL of turbid looking fluid.
Fluid significant for 283 WBCs and 9750 RBCs with cultures
pending and a drain was placed. There were no complications from
the procedure and she has been transferred to the CCU for
post-pericardiocentesis monitoring.  On the floor, initial
vitals were T=97.5 BP= 124/73 HR=95 RR=17 O2 sat=  95% RA with
significant wheezine noted on exam.

.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
She has baseline dyspnea on exertion with 2 pillow orthopnea
which has remained stable for months.  She notes occasional
ankle edema in the summer and is on lasix daily, but no current
edema.  She has noted increased bruising in the setting of her
starting coumadin

[**2114-12-7**]- TTE: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: No significant residual pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-12-5**],
findings are similar.

[**2114-12-6**]- CXR: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient
with pericardial effusion after pericardiocentesis.
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**12-5**], [**2114**].
The current cardiac silhouette appears to be unchanged, not even
slightly
increased since the prior study, which potentially may be due to
appearance of PE, which may be due to upright position of the
patient and relatively low lung volumes but definitely no
decrease in the cardiac silhouette has been demonstrated. There
is also presence of increased interstitial markers that are
worrisome for at least mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Upper
lungs are essentially clear except for those mild interstitial
markers. There is no pneumothorax. There is small amount of
bilateral pleural effusion. Note is made that the overall
cardiac silhouette appears to be unchanged since the prior
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo female with PMH significant for COPD, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, PVD, carotid artery disease, with new diagnosis
of a. fib and pericardial effusion, now s/p pericardiocentesis.
.
# Pericardial Effusion: s/p uncomplicted pericardiocentesis with
600cc of fluid removed.  Fluid notable for elevated WBCs and
RBCs, with cultures pending. Etiology unclear at this point.
OSH chest CT which ruled out lung malignancy, but another occult
malignancy could still be a possibility.  Negative breast and
skin exam.  Viral process could also explain the effusion,
especially with her recent history of persistent URI symptoms
over the past several months.  Repeat echo the morning after
drain placement showed minimal pericardial effusion and the
drain was pulled without complication.  Echo one day later
showed no recurrent effusion.  She will need an echo as an
outpa
