History of Present Illness:
84 yo w/several month h/o exertional
shoulder discomfort which is relieved w/NTG. He has had 3 day
h/o
worsening shortness of breath and shoulder pain.  On admission
he
recieved nitroglycerin and his chest pain was relieved.  On EKG
he was found to have STD laterally and
apically as well as QW anteriorly as well as positive troponin
with an acute MI.
This pm on the floor the patient developed worsening confusion
and hypotension.  He was taken to the cath lab where he was
found
to have severe left main disease and developed hypotension with
injection of the coronary arteries.  He required an intra aortic
balloon pump for hemodynamic stabilization and decision was made
to take him emergently to the operating room.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale
is present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex and
distal anterior, inferior, septal, and lateral walls. There is
hypokinesis of the basal to mid anterior, anterolateral, and
inferolateral walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). The remaining left
ventricular segments are hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There is an intraaortic balloon pump with the
tip 5 cm distal to the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of
the results at time of surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is sinus rhythm. The patient is on an
epinephrine infusion. Left ventricular function is improved with
an EF of 40-45%. Right ventricular function is unchanged.
Regional wall motion abnormalities are improved with mild global
hypokinesis. Mitral regurgitation is unchanged. Aortic
regurgitation is unchanged. Tricuspid regurgitation is
unchanged. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted from ER to cardiology service on [**11-9**] with acute
Myocardial Infarction. Taken to cath lab that evening and found
to have critical Left Main, 3Vessel  Coronary Artery Disease and
IABP placed. He was taken emergently to OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in
the early AM [**11-10**] for Emergent coronary artery bypass grafting
x5 on intra- aortic balloon pump, with the left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery,reversed
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the second
diagonal coronary artery, reversed saphenous vein single graft
from the aorta to the first obtuse marginal coronary artery, as
well as reversed saphenous vein double sequential graft from the
aorta to the distal right coronary artery and the posterior
descending coronary artery/ Partial resection of mediastinal
mass dictated separately by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3140**]. CARDIOPULMONARY
BYPASS TIME:  103 minutes.CROSS-CLAMP TIME: 75 minutes.
Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated
epinephrine, phenylephrine, Dobutamine and propofol drips.POD#2
the IABP was weaned and discontinued.Pressors were ultimately
weaned to off. Lines and drains were discontinued per protocol.
POD#3 He was neurologically intact, hemodynamically stable, and
weaned to extubate. Beta-blocker/Statin/aspirin and diuresis
were initiated. An ACE-I was added for afterload reduction -
however, this was stopped prior to discharge secondary to
persistent hyperkalemia. Mr. [**Known lastname 3141**] had postop confusion that
improved back to baseline, he slowly progressed and on [**11-15**] he
was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. Wound care was consulted for impaired skin integrity
of his stage III sacral decub - this was treated with Mepilex
and daily dressing changes. Postoperative leukocytosis was
monitored with surveillance cultures and repeat CXRs. A small
amount of sternal drainage was evident and he was started on
empiric antibiotics. ID was consulted and CT of the chest
revealed no source of infection. Cultures were all negative at
the time of discharge - blood culture was pending with no growth
to date. His WBC had decreased to 17.2 from 22.9 and he remained
afebrile. He will be discharged to rehab with Keflex x 7 days
for res
