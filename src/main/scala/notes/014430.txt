Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Keflex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Emergent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 on an intra-aortic
balloon pump with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending coronary; reverse saphenous vein single graft from
aorta to ramus intermedius coronary artery; reverse saphenous
vein single graft from aorta to first obtuse marginal coronary
artery.


History of Present Illness:
54 YO M with DMII, HTN, HLD, PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass on the left
and iliac stent on the right, ? h/o MI without intervention,
presented to the ED at [**Hospital1 1474**]  found to be in DKA with glucose
in the 490's. Per report patient with gradual onset weakness,
nausea, loose stool, excessive thirst. Due to decreased PO
intake patient omitted "several days" of insulin therapy.
Progressive symptoms prompted presentation to OSH ED found to
have a ph 7.0 and admitted to ICU for treatment of DKA. In the
ICU patient placed on an Insulin gtt overnight and covered
empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin and
flagyl. In the AM, gap had resolved and pH normalized and
transitioned to SQ Lantus. Antibiotics were stopped as clinical
suspicion for infection low.
Later in morning, he was noted to develop increased agitation,
EKG showed ST depression  V4-V6. Patient started on Arixtra for
anticoagulation as unable to start Heparin secondary to allergy
(though pt received hep SQ during OSH stay without problem) and
patient refused [**Name (NI) **]. CXR obtained which was consistent with
volume overload. He was urgently taken to Cath lab. Per report
he was intubated for respiratory stabilization pre-procedure but
had never been hypoxic. In cath lab, he was noted to have severe
distal left main disease with diffused LAD disease, RCA noted to
be chronically occluded, there are collateral artery L-R and
R-R, PCWP of 35, EF of [**9-27**]%.  IABP was placed through right
femoral artery and vein.  In the cath lab he was given 40mg of
IV Lasix, 5 of dobutamine and 20 of levophed and agumented BP to
140s of note his prior unaugmented SBP was 85-90 systolic. Per
med flight patient with uneventful transport. He is sedated
(versed) and paralyzed (vecuronium). On arrival to the CCU
patient SBP is augmented with levophed. Cardiac surgery
consulted for coronary revascularization.

PORTABLE CHEST, [**2138-4-20**]
FINDINGS: Radiodense tip of an intraaortic balloon pump is at
the expected
junction of the superior aspect of the aortic knob and left
subclavian artery, as communicated by telephone to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1255**] on
[**2138-4-20**] at 8:20 a.m.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube
are in standard position. Heart size is normal. Bilateral
interstitial pulmonary edema is present as well as an
asymmetrical left perihilar alveolar process, likely reflecting
asymmetrical edema.
.
TTE: [**4-/2138**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
