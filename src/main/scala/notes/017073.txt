Service:  VASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left foot ulceration.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  History of present illness is
obtained from the office note.  The patient is a known
insulin dependent diabetic with chronic renal end stage
disease on dialysis who had a plantar ulcer, which was first
noted in [**2155-10-26**] and underwent excision of the ulcer
and debridement and primary closure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The
patient has ultimately broken down and has become an ulcer,
which has not healed over many months.  She was followed by
her podiatrist [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32698**] and her primary care physician
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 32699**].  She returns for evaluation.  She is admitted
for elective revascularization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of pulmonary hypertension,
left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure.  She
is a type 2 diabetic times fifteen years insulin dependent.
She has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and morbid
obesity.  She has end stage renal disease on dialysis Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.

ALLERGIES:  Multiple includes Penicillin, sulfa, Ceftazidime,
Vancomycin and Clindamycin.  Reactions unknown.

MEDICATIONS:  Calcitriol, calcium carbonate, Darvon and
insulin with Regranex dressings to her left foot.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a chronically ill obese female
in no acute distress.  Blood pressure 120/80.  Pulse 110.
Respiratory rate 12.  Right below the knee stump is well
healed.  There is a hyperpigmentation and lipodermatosis of
her left leg from knee to foot.  There is marked dependency
ruber in her left foot.  There is a 3 by 1 cm ulcer at the
subcutaneous tissue at the mid portion of the plantar surface
of the left foot.  This is clean and noninfected.  There is
scant granulation present.  Pulse examination shows no
palpable popliteal or pedal pulses.  Her femoral pulses are
nonpalpable due to obesity.  The remaining of her examination
is unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent on [**12-21**] a left
common femoral artery to popliteal bypass graft with Dacron.
She was transferred to the PACU in stable condition and
remained in the VICU overnight and was transferred to the
regular nursing floor prior to having her PA line changed to
CVL.  She developed increasing white count, fevers or chills,
Abdominal CT of the left was obtained, which did show a fluid
collection.  She was begun on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and
Flagyl were continued.  She underwent on [**12-31**] a removal of a
femoral popliteal graft with vein angioplasty.  ________ was
started at this time.  She was transferred to the VICU and
remained in the VICU until the night when she was transferred
to the regular nursing floor.  A PICC [**Doctor Last Name **] was placed on
[**1-4**].  On [**1-6**] the patient had two episodes of left groin
bleeding, which required her return to the operative room for
exploration and control of bleeding.

On [**1-11**] she underwent a left above the knee amputation
secondary to left leg ischemia.  On [**2-8**], after
conservative treatment of the wound she underwent a split
thickness skin graft muscle flap of the left groin.  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU
in stable condition.  She remained in the VICU overnight and
then was transferred to the regular nursing floor.  The left
above the knee continued to show necrotic changes and she
underwent on [**2157-2-23**] revision of her left above the knee.
Prior to that she had a PICC line placement.  She did well
until [**2157-2-25**] when she spiked a temperature max of 101.2.  She
was pan cultured.  Her blood cultures grew E-coli and at this
time Meropenem was added to her antibiotic regimen along with
the Vancomycin.  After discussion with the staff it was felt
that there was a need to adjust her antibiotics so that they
could all be given at dialysis and the PICC line could be
discontinued.  On [**2-28**] her Meropenem was discontinued and
Gentamycin was begun.  Also noted on her left above the knee
amputation stump some drainage in the medial aspect of the
stump incision.  This was opened and cultured.  The final
culture results are pending.  The gram stain showed no
organisms with 2+ polys.  She will continue on her
antibiotics for a total of four weeks.

Her donor site wound is clean, dry and intact.  Her wound
dressing on the groin graft area with Adaptic and dry sterile
dressing b.i.d.  She should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
once discharged from rehab.
