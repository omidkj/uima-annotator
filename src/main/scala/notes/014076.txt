Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial fibrillation and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion for unstable atrial fibrillation
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
74 Russian speaking male w/ history of dementia, depression,
remote CAD, afib, s/p pacer, now being admitted for increased
lethargy, obtundation, fever, atrial fibrillation and
hypotension  64/30 and tachypnea 32-34.
.
On review of the notes from [**Hospital 100**] rehab, patient was lethargic
since [**2181-8-18**]. Olanzapine, namenda and depakote stopped. His BP
had been 80-90/40-50 and P90s. On day of admission, he spiked
fever to 103 w/ AF w/ RVR and more hypotension. His [**Month/Day/Year 802**] was
called and the decision was to admit him.
.
On arrival to the ED, his vital signs were T102.6 P180 BP64/30.
Due to unknown code status at the time, cardioversion was
attempted twice w/ 50 and 100J but to no avail. He was given 5L
NS. He was also started on vanco/levo/flagyl. Later phone call
to NH claims that he is DNR/DNI
.
On arrival to the ICU, phone calls were made to [**Hospital 100**] rehab,
PCP([**Doctor First Name **] O/[**Location (un) **]), brother(HCP) and Nice([**Doctor First Name **], who claims
to be legal guardian. [**Name (NI) **] Rehab claims that he is DNR/DNI.
Brother deferred all decision making to [**Doctor First Name **]. [**Doctor First Name **] claims to be
legal guardian and wants to patient to be full code regardless
of situation. PCP did not call back at the time of admission.


Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement, not
anticoagulated [**3-1**] med non-adherence and fall risk. EP had
apparently evaluated his pacer which was thought to be
functional. Rate control was noted to be difficult given pt's
agitation and often refusal/non-compliance w/ po agents.
2. Dementia/personolity disorder as above, frequently required
chemical/mechanical restraint; has had psych evaluation in past
admission. Patient has multiple falls/gait unsteady
3. BPH
4. h/o multiple falls, 1 causing SDH requiring evacuation
5. s/p inguinal hernia repair w/ mesh [**1-30**]
6. CAD w/ evidence of mild reversible defects on emibi in
'[**72**]??EF 25-30% per [**Hospital **] rehab note
7. ?CKD baseline 1.2-1.3
8. hypothyroidism

Pt was born and raised in [**Country 532**]. He was married and divorced in
a marriage which produced a 37yo son who lives in [**Country 532**]. He

CXR (portable AP) [**8-26**] - Compared to [**2181-6-16**].  The patient is
rotated to the left on this study.  Heart is enlarged, allowing
for
differences in technique, unchanged from the prior study.
Right-sided pacer with dual leads unchanged in position and
intact.  The right lung is clear. There is a left retrocardiac
opacity, which may relate to atelectasis, consolidation, or
aspiration.  No pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous structures are
normal.

EKG [**2181-8-26**] - Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response @ 162 bpm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2181-6-17**] vetricular pacing is no longer
recorded and the ventricular response has increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 M w/ h/o dementia, depression, remote CAD, afib, s/p pacer,
now admitted for fatigue, weakness, altered mental status,
atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
.
1) hypotension: The differential diagnosis included dehydration
(pt with hypernatremia, acute renal failure on admission),
sepsis (fever,?worsening AF, hypoxia, lactate 2.1, CXR with new
L retrocardiac opacity), and ?PE from RA clot(AF). The pt was
given 2 L of IVF boluses and was cardioverted for unstable
atrial fibrillation with resolution of low BPs. [**Last Name (un) **] stimulation
and initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco/levo/flagyl)
was also started on admission. Blood and urine cultures were
sent. The urine culture was no growth (final). A urine
legionella antigen was negative.  Blood cultures were still
pending on discharge, however given the fact that the pt did not
have leukocytosis, remained AF, and maintained SBPs > 100 during
the remaining ICU course, it is not likely that he pt is
bacteremic.
.
2) PNA: On admission, the pt was hypoxic initially w/ tachypnea,
CXR show left retrocardiac opacity. started on broad spectrum
antibiotics as above.
The sputum culture was contaminated. The pt was discharged on
Vancomycin 1 gm q24h and Levofloxacin 500 mg IV q24h to complete
a 10 day course for institution acquired PNA (the pt is now on
day 4 of 10).
.
3) atrial fibrillation s/p pacer: In the ED, the pt was
cardioverted for unstable atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response with good result. On transfer to the ICU,
he was placed on telemetry and the pt was noted to have a HR in
the 120-130s with stable BPs and was given Lopressor 5 mg IV
with some improvement in rate control. Digoxin was loaded and
started on the second hospital day for further rate control. The
digoxin level was subtherapeutic at 0.6 2 days after digoxin
load; however as pt had not gotten digoxin the day before the
test was drawn [**3-1**] renal dosing of digoxin, will continue
digoxin 0.125 mg.  The pt is not anticoagulated with coumadin
[**3-1**] fall risk and aspirin was continued during hospital course.
Of note, the pt may be restarted on his usual rate control
medication atenolol at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab as he is no longer
hypotensive.
.
4) hypothryoidism: The pt was continued on synthroid, TFTs
within normal limits on admission.
.
5) acute on chronic renal disease: The
