FINAL REPORT


AP CHEST, 9:30 A.M. ON [**7-4**].

HISTORY: Chest tube removed.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-29**] and [**7-2**]:

Lung volumes are lower, bibasilar atelectasis moderately severe
has worsened
accompanied by increasing small bilateral pleural effusion. Low
lung volumes
exaggerate heart size which is top normal, probably unchanged.
Upper lobe
vasculature is mildly engorged, but there is no pulmonary edema.
Transvenous
right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are continuous
from a left
pectoral pacemaker which lies substantially lower on today's
examination than
on [**7-2**].
