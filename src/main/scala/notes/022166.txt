Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2138-9-3**] where
the patient underwent Bilateral mini thoracotomies with
pulmonary vein isolation using the AtriCure Synergy bipolar RF
device with resection of left atrial appendage.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support. Her pain was not well control and
anesthesia performed on [**9-3**] bilateral T6 paravertebral blocks
x2 and repeat on [**9-4**] bilateral T4, T7, T10 paravertebral block
with better pain control. Dofetilide was restarted. She transfer
to the floor on POD1. She had brief episodes of self limiting
atrial fibrillation 120's. She was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  She was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on [**2138-9-6**] the patient was
ambulating freely, bilateral wounds were healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
