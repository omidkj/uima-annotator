CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old Caucasian
female whose recent medical course was significant for a
laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed at [**Hospital3 7362**] one
and a half weeks prior to admission.  She was subsequently
sent home one day postoperatively and had persistent
abdominal pain and shortness of breath.

The abdominal pain and shortness of breath persisted such
that she was readmitted to [**Hospital3 7362**] on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**],
[**8-30**].  Workup at [**Hospital3 7362**] was significant for an
electrocardiogram which showed an first heart sound Q3/T3
pattern on her Emergency Room electrocardiogram.  She
subsequently had a perfusion scan which was read out as
normal (per report).  She also had a CT of the abdomen and a
HIDA scan which revealed a bile leak.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography and further management of her bile
leak.

The patient was brought to the Gastroenterology Suite where
an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was
performed under general anesthesia.  The patient did have
evidence of choledocholithiasis as well as a bile duct leak
at the duct of Luschka.  The patient had a sphincterotomy and
a stone extraction.  She also had a stent placed.

Status post procedure, the patient was extubated and was
noted to be breathing rapidly and with shallow breaths.  She
had oxygen saturations around 85%.  On examination, she was
noted to have diffuse pulmonary rales.  She was treated with
Lasix 20 mg intravenously with good urine output.

Given her tenuous respiratory status, the patient was
transferred that evening to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history includes)
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus; which has been diet controlled.
2.  Migraines.
3.  Status post cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications at home included
verapamil-SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. (for migraines).

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Her medications at the outside
hospital on transfer included cefotetan 1 g q.12h.,
Flagyl 50 intravenously q.8h., verapamil 240 mg p.o. q.d.,
psyllium, Dilaudid, and Percocet.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 1456**].  She is
married.  She does smoke tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Her admission
examination to the Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressure was 110/60, heart rate was 95
(in sinus), respiratory rate was 18 to 22, oxygen saturation
was 91% to 94% on 100% nonrebreather.  She also had a
temperature to 101.8.  In general, the patient was slightly
tachypneic with talking.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils were equally
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  The
oropharynx was moist and pink.  The neck revealed no jugular
venous distention.  There were no bruits.  Lungs revealed
bibasilar crackles one-third of the way of bilaterally.
Cardiovascular revealed first heart sound and second heart
sound, tachycardic but a regular rate.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  The abdomen revealed bowel sounds were hypoactive.
There was right upper quadrant tenderness.  No rebound.  No
guarding.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities revealed there
were 2+ pulses.  No lower extremity edema was noted.  On
neurologic examination, the patient was alert and oriented
and moved all extremities; otherwise, a nonfocal neurologic
examination.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Her laboratories
on admission to the Intensive Care Unit included complete
[**Last Name (Titles) **] count with white [**Last Name (Titles) **] cell count of 18, hematocrit
was 37.4, platelets were 476.  Her Chemistry-7 revealed
sodium was 137, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 97,
bicarbonate was 22, [**Last Name (Titles) **] urea nitrogen was 13, creatinine
was 0.7, [**Last Name (Titles) **] glucose was 198.  Coagulations revealed PT
was 14.6, PTT was 27.8, INR was 1.5.  Her arterial [**Last Name (Titles) **] gas
on admission was pH of 7.47, PCO2 was 36, PO2 was 83; and
that was on a 35% face mask.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Her chest x-ray on admission to the
Intensive Care Unit that night (AP portable) showed a small
right effusion, [**Last Name (un) 16765**] B-lines, and pulmonary vascular
redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure.

Her electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia at 110, with
normal axis and normal intervals.  She did have an S wave in
lead I; although, she did not have a Q wave or an inverted T
wave in lead III on this electrocardiogram.  Compared to the
electrocardiogram from [**Hospital3 7362**], she did have upright T
waves across the precordium; which, when compared to the
other electrocardiogram, was new.  She did have flat T waves
across the precordium at [**Hospital3 7362**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  She had other laboratories drawn which
came back significant for cardiac enzymes with creatine
kinase times three were flat at 36, 58, and 38.  She did have
a troponin which went from 1.2 to 4 and back to 1.1.

Subjectively, the patient was feeling much better throughout
her course in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and her
supplemental oxygen was weaned from an initial 35% face mask
down to 2 liters nasal cannula, and ultimately to off; during
which she remained 99% oxygen saturation even on room air.

In terms of diagnostic workup; it was unclear as to what the
reason for her persistent hypoxia and dyspnea was.  She did
have evidence of the first heart sound, Q3/T3, pattern at
[**Hospital3 7362**], and a report of a normal perfusion scan.  She
also had the evidence of a small troponin leak; although, no
known history of coronary artery disease.

The patient received an echocardiogram which showed an
ejection fraction of greater than 50%.  It was also
significant for mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Pulmonary artery pressures were not able to be determined.
She had no focal wall motion abnormalities.

The patient also received a CT of the chest; both for looking
at the possibility of a pulmonary embolism as well as to look
at her lung parenchyma.  It was a suboptimal CT; although, it
was good enough to rule out large perfusion defects.  It also
did show the lung parenchyma significant for ground-glass
opacities; felt most consistent to be pulmonary edema.

Given those findings, the patient was given another 20 mg of
intravenously Lasix; to which the patient did diurese
approximately 2 more liters.  It was after this that the
patient did finally come off of all supplemental oxygen.

From a gastrointestinal perspective, the patient's abdominal
pain was entirely gone by the morning status post procedure.
She started on a clear liquid diet on the morning status post
procedure and tolerated this well.  She did have two bowel
movements on her first full day in the Intensive Care Unit
and was passing flatus.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   She was to follow up with her primary
care physician (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**]); who was contact[**Name (NI) **] and will
see her the day after discharge.  She was also to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19731**] in Gastroenterology for removal of her
stent in six weeks' times.  She was also scheduled for a
stress test with nuclear imaging on [**9-13**] at 4:30 at the
[**Last Name (un) 469**] Center to help delineate the etiology of any
potential cardiac problems.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She was to remain on a low-fat diet
for two weeks' time.  She was also sent out on
levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (times 10 days) on the advice
of the Gastroenterology Department.
