Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion, dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Liver biopsy [**2166-4-18**]

History of Present Illness:
51 year-old male with history of newly diagnosed metastatic lung
cancer to liver, bones, and brain via PET imaging, stigmata of
chronic liver disease probably from alcoholism based on history,
presenting with one day history of confusion and dizziness in
addition to worsening LFTs. Patient has not established with
oncology given lack of tissue diagnosis. Patient's labs drawn by
Thoracic Surgery [**2166-4-3**] were as follows: Tbili 10.8, ALP 283,
AST 220, ALT 81, so he was called by primary care NP and asked
to present to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.6 P 104 BP 142/70 R 18 Sat 96%
RA. Patient was noted to be jaundiced. Labs were notable for Na
131, Ca [**69**], Cr 1.6 from baseline of 0.8. LFTs were remarkable
for AST 352, ALT 76, TBili 15.8, Direct Bili 12, Alk Phos 229.
Ammonia was 105. INR was noted to be 1.5. Blood and urine
cultures were sent, with urinalysis unremarkable. 2 liters IVF
were given in ED for hypercalcemia with some improvement in
mental status. Head CT was performed and showed no acute process
with known cerebellar lesion on MRI not visualized. Right upper
quadrant U/S showed CBD with 2 mm diameter and no intrahepatic
biliary dilation, with no evidence of cholecystitis or focal
liver lesions seen on limited images obtained. Vitals in ED
prior to transfer were as follows: T98.4 HR 103 166/79 93% RA.

On the floor, patient is in no acute distress, but unable to
answer questions appropriately.

MICROBIOLOGY:

MRSA SCREEN: NEGATIVE
HCV VIRAL LOAD: 800,000

PATHOLOGY:
LIVER CORE BX  [**2166-4-18**]:  Metastatic carcinoma with
neuroendocrine features. The morphologic and immunophenotypic
features are consistent with a lung primary.

RADIOLOGY:
PET SCAN [**2166-4-9**]:
1. Large left lower lobe FDG avid mass with multiple osseous and

hepatic metastases as well as large metastatic lymph nodes in
the aortocaval and portocaval regions.
2. Asymmetric FDG avidity in the left vocal chord which may be
due to tumor involvement of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve.


MRI HEAD [**2166-4-9**]:
3-mm lesion within the left cerebellar hemisphere with
enhancement seen on
only axial post-gadolinium images are not clearly visualized on
the
post-gadolinium MP-RAGE images as described above. The presence
of the lesion on the FLAIR and T2 images is suggestive of
metastatic lesion. However, given the small size of this
solitary if further confirmation is clinically required (for
therapeutic purposes), repeat T1 post-gadolinium axial and
coronal images of the posterior fossa with 3-mm section
thickness would help.

CT HEAD [**2166-4-11**]:
1. No acute intracranial process. Known left cerebellar lesion
is not
apparent on unenhanced CT.
2. Aerosolized secretions and mucosal thickening in the left
maxillary sinus.

RUQ U/S [**2166-4-12**]:
1. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The common bile duct
measures 2 mm.
2. The gallbladder is decompressed, likely accounting for wall
thickening,
with no evidence of cholecystitis.
3. Limited images demonstrating no focal liver lesion, though
correlation
with recent PET-CT (reportedly showing focal liver lesions
concerning for
metastases) is advised.

CXR [**2166-4-12**]:
There is again seen an area of consolidation projecting over the
left base
compatible with known infiltrate in the left lower lobe abutting
the major
fissure. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There
is no
pneumothoraces or pleural effusions identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 year-old male with h/o newly diagnosed metastatic cancer with
lung, liver, brain, and bone lesions via PET imaging, presented
with altered mental status, liver failure, and hypercalcemia.
Patient was treated for hypercalcemia and hepatic encephalopathy
in the ICU; IV fluids, calcitonin, and pamidronate for
hypercalcemia and lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic
encephalopathy.  CXR revealed PNA for which the patient was
treated initially with levofloxacin and metronidazole and later
broadened to cefepime and metronidazole.  His mental status
improved and patient was transferred to the floor on hospital
day 2.

Diagnostic paracentesis and liver biopsy were performed.  Liver
biopsy pathology revealed findings consistent with lung cancer.
The patient's liver failure progressively worsened with MELD
score reaching 34 when labs stopped being drawn. Because of the
extremely grave prognosis of widely metastatic lung cancer (mets
to the brain, liver nad bones) and hepatic failure, the patient
opted to transition to hospice care.  His chief request was that
he be made comfortable and that any pain related to cancer will
be treated promptly and adequately.  He designated his brother,
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 102482**], to be his healthcare proxy.

On [**2166-4-23**], he was noted to have worsening in his mental
status and to be more labored in his breathing.  He appeared to
be near death.  His family was notified of his change in status.
 However, soon after notifying the family, this writer was
notified that he had died.  He was reassessed and was noted to
have unreactive pupils and no evidence of cardiopulmonary
activity.  The family was notified of his death.  Time of death
was 8:34 AM.  The patient's brother declined post-mortem exam.
