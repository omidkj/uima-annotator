Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Generalized weakness, N/V, chest discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
73yo Russian speaking only woman with h/o DM2, HTN,
hyperlipidemia followed at [**Hospital1 336**] who presents with complaint of
generalized weakness, N/V.  She reports feeling generally weak
and unwell over the past few days and has not been
eating/drinking well due to decreased appetite and mild nausea.
Overnight, she awoke feeling very unwell with increased nausea
and dizziness.  She took her BS and it was 77 so she drank some
juice and ate honey.  She then awoke a second time feeling even
worse with nausea, lightheadedness, and dizziness.  She then
took her BP which she reports was 240/110.  She took 5mg of
nifedipine which eventually brought her blood pressure down to
160s.  She denies headache at the time of hypertension at home,
however she reports she had a headache in the ED which has since
resolved.  She endorses intermittent chest discomfort/tightness
that radiates to her jaw.  She reports it is difficult to
discern whether this is due to her N/V or whether it is "due to
her heart".  She denies radiation down her arm nor to her back
(although she reports upper back pain/burning which is not new).
 She does report intermittent "tachycardia" and palpitations at
home last evening.  She denies significant associated SOB, no
diaphoresis.  She reports she had one episode of nonbloody
emesis at home and then again in the emergency department.  She
reports her symptoms were alleviated by zofran and GI cocktail
and she is now feeling a bit better and hungry.  She denies
abdominal pain currently although she endorsed epigastric
discomfort in the setting of her N/V in the ED.  No diarrhea,
blood in stool, no dark/tarry colored stool.  She is passing
gas, last BM yesterday.  She denies sick contacts.  She further
denies fevers/chills.  No dysuria/hematuria.  No cough.  She has
had dizziness and lightheadedness in the setting of poor PO.
.
Of note, she was admitted to [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center in [**4-4**] with
abdominal pain, N/V at which time KUBs showed she was FOS.
Althoguh she did not undergo formal gastric emptying study, she
was discharged on reglan with presumptive diagnosis of chroinic
constipation and gastroparesis.  Per her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] then followed
up with gastroenterology at [**Hospital1 3278**] who felt her symptoms of
abdominal discomfort and distention were due to chronic
constipation and they recommended metamucil.  Per her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
patient never took reglan because she was concerned about side
effects.  Also of note, she underwent PMIBI at that time which
demonstrated a small, mild reversible perfusion defect in the
anteroapical area.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 96.9 BP: 150/66 HR: 75 RR: 15
O2 sat: 100%RA.  Initial FS was 140.  Labs were notable for
sodium of 126, bicarb of 19 with AG of 18.  UA was negative.
WBC was mildly elevated to 11.5 with 88% neutrophilia, no bands.
 Potassium was 3.2 for which she received 40mEq PO KCL.  CXR was
negative for clear infiltrate.  EKG demonstrated TWI III, V1-V3.
 Cardiac enzymes were sent and were negative x1.  She
experienced nausea without vomiting while in the ED for which
she received IV zofran x1.  She also received GI cocktail for
epigastric discomfort that she experienced in the setting of
N/V.
.
She is now being admitted for r/o MI and further rx and
evaluation of her N/V.
.
ROS:  As above.  Additionally she denies orthopnea/PND.  No
changes in vision; she wears glasses at baseline.  No
dysuria/hematuria.  She denies rashes.  Endorses chronic back
pain which is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially
presented with  N/V and chest discomfort & subsequently found to
be found to be hyponatremic who subsequently became acutely
tachypneic and coded in the setting of a seizure and AMI.
.
#Hyponatremia: Sodium on admission was 126.
Hydrochlorothiazide was held, and she received IV NS. Serum
sodium fell to 116. In this context she had a generalized
tonic-clonic seizure and PEA arrest.  She was effectively
rescucitated and transferred to the ICU where she received
hypertonic saline and fluid restriction. The renal team was
involved.  The cause of hyponatremia was thought to be a
combination of her hypovolemia, hydrochlorothiazide, poor PO
intake, and vomitting.  There was also concern for SIADH. CT
head was without evidence of tumor.  Her sodium normalized to
140's and remained there throughout the duration of her
admission.  Further workup of SIADH was deferred to her
outpatient physician.
.
#Myocardial Infarction: On her initial presentation in the [**Name (NI) **],
pt reported chest discomfort with EKG unchanged from baseline.
One day later, in the context of low sodium and seizure, she had
an NSTEMI in proximal LAD distribution.  Stat echo showed large
anterior wall hypokinesis and LVEF of 25%, consistent with an
ischemic event.  The cardiology team was involved.  Plavix and a
beta blocker were started, and ASA and statin were increased.
Lipids were checked and were at goal (LDL 75). Cardiac
catheterization was deferred until her acute issues were
resolved.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**].  Repeat echo showed
a recovery of LVEF to 55% and moderate mitral regurgitation. She
had subsequent episodes of R-sided chest discomfort without EKG
changes, thought to be secondary to musculoskeletal trauma from
chest compressions.
.
#Respiratory failure:  The patient developed severe tachypnea
and metabolic alkalosis in the setting of her STEMI, thought to
be a consequence of both pulmonary edema from an acutely
decompensated heart and aspiration pneumonia.  She was
intubated.  Sputum showed moderate strep pneumo-pan sensitive,
and she received 10 days of levofloxacin and 5 days of
vancomycin. Extubation was complicated by laryngeal inflammation
and edema, with initial attempt requiring reintubation.  She was
later succuessfully extubated with heliox, and subsequently
quickly weaned off nasal ca
