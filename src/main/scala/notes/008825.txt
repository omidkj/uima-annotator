Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2107-9-17**] Flexible bronchoscopy, 0.8 tracheostomy with
tracheostomy change to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] TTS adjustable near diameter 7
mm in length adjusted to 12 cm.


History of Present Illness:
38 yo M with osteogenesis imperfecta with tracheomalacia with a
trach placed in [**3-/2107**] after a EtOH related seizure with failure
to wean from vent, transferred from an OSH for respiratory
distress and for evaluation for tracheal stent placement by IP.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 86512**] with respiratory
distress. Patient noted on bronchoscopy to have granulation
tissue -- this was removed with cryotherapy and mechanical
debridement but he was noted to have bad TBM. Plan was for IP
f/u in one month. Also with coag negative staph bacteremia on
last admission treated with 7 days of Vancomycin. He was also
recently admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital from [**2107-9-10**] -
[**2107-9-12**] from his rehab with difficulty with ventilation. He was
admitted to the MICU, underwent a trach change ([**Last Name (un) 295**] TTS). He
was easier to ventilate with a pediatric ETT, placed via the
tracheostomy. He was successfully ventilated on PC RR 14
Pressure of 16 and PEEP of 5, I time of 0.9 seconds, FiO2 of 35%
which he tolerated well after multiple vent settings were tried.
He was transfused 1 U PRBCs for anemia, and also discharged on
steroids (solumedrol) with plans for a prednisone taper. Pt
reports he is ventilated at all times, even at rehab. Per the
discharge summary, the patient was aware that the accumulating
granulation tissue would lead to his eventual demise, and he was
confirmed DNR at that time.
.
The patient was discharged back to [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**2107-9-13**] and
was doing well when he was noted to become hypoxic with RR to
the 40s yesterday. He was noted to be difficult to ventilate
again, so he was transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on
[**2107-9-17**]. There, patient reversed his code status from DNR to
Full Code, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for IP evaluation and
possible tracheal stent placement.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.1 116 138/58 28 100% on PC IP 20
PEEP of 5 100% FiO2. He was being bag mask ventilated on
arrival. He was switched to pressure control. His labs were
significant for a WBC of 28.5, Hct of 32, INR of 1.0. He
received IV Vancomycin 1 gram x1 and was supposed to receive
Zosyn but had not received it upon transfer to the ICU floor. On
transfer from ED VS were afebrile 108 122/61 24 100% on current
setting vent settings. Of note, IP was consulted in the ED for
tracheal stent placement vs. advancement of the trach and he was
immediately taken to the OR upon transfer to the ICU floor. In
the OR, most of the obstructive tissue was noted both 1 cm above
and below the trach, and it was mostly scar tissue, so no
debridement was performed. Biviona #7 was placed at 12 cm. No
antibiotics were given.
.
On the floor, the patient admits to R sided shoulder pain and
some difficulty breathing.

The lungs are grossly clear. There is no pleural effusion. This
study is
limited due to the severe distorted anatomy of the chest
secondary to known osteogenesis imperfecta with severe
scoliosis. Tracheostomy tube is in place. The tip is
approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. The stomach is less
distended. A central catheter projects from the left, the tip
cannot be accurately located.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of new lung abnormalities. The lungs
appear clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Acute on chronic respiratory failure - Attributed to partial
obstruction by granulation tissue, ventilator-associated
pneumonia, and deconditioning. On [**2107-9-17**] had flexible
bronchoscopy and tracheostomy was changed to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] TTS
adjustable near diameter 7 mm in length adjusted to 12 cm. Per
the Interventional Pulmonology team, the tracheostomy should not
be adjusted under any circumstances.
.
#Tracheobronchitis - Despite leukocytosis, no infiltrate on CXR.
Tracheal sputum culture grew sparse MRSA and rare gram negative
rods, for which a 5-day course of vanco/cefepime were prescribed
(to end [**9-22**]).
.
#Hypertension - Continued
