FIVE VIEWS, RIGHT FEMUR: Again seen is a comminuted right
intertrochanteric fracture. The right hip joint is intact. The
remainder of the femur is unremarkable. There is a small right
knee joint effusion.

NON-CONTRAST CERVICAL SPINE CT: No prior for comparison. There
is a fracture at the base of C2 dens suggestive of type II
fracture. There is approximately 3 mm of posterior subluxation
of the dens relative to [**Name (NI) 12952**] body. The remainder of the vertebral
bodies of the cervical spine appear intact, though there are
laminectomy defects at C3 through C5. Complete loss of disc
height at C2-3 through C6-7, with bone-on- bone appearance at
these levels. There is very slight retrolisthesis (grade I) of
C5 on C6 and grade I anterolisthesis of C6 on C7, with vacuum
disc phenomenon at C6-7. Exaggerated lordosis centered at C6.
Some prominence of soft tissue is seen anterior to C2,
consistent with the appearance of acute fracture. Lung apices
show no emphysematous changes. Imaged portions of the mastoid
air cells are clear.

   RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

C-SPINE SGL 1 VIEW  [**2153-4-16**] 6:08 PM

C-SPINE SGL 1 VIEW; SPINAL FLUORO WITHOUT RADIOLOG

Reason: HALO PLACEMENT

INDICATION: Status post halo placement.

FINDINGS: A single intraoperative operative fluoroscopic spot
film image is provided from intraoperative fluoroscopy without
radiologist present. The image is centered over the upper
cervical spine. No listhesis is identified. For further details,
please refer to the official operative report.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2153-4-14**] 2:52 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT CHEST W/CONTRAST

Reason: eval for injury
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for injury
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post fall, now chest pain.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images from
the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the
administration of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats
were also obtained.

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are moderate dependent
atelectatic changes. Linear atelectasis is seen at left lung
base. There is increased interstitial markings, which, in this
case, probably indicate a degree of mild fluid overload. An
ill-defined 1-cm nodule is seen in the anterolateral right upper
lobe. A small rounded 3-mm pulmonary nodule is seen more
inferiorly in the right middle lobe. There are shotty
mediastinal lymph nodes and a calcified lymph node in the right
paratracheal region, measuring 13 mm. Other lymph nodes are not
pathologically enlarged. The aorta is normal in caliber, without
evidence of dissection. There are coronary vascular
calcifications, most notably in the left anterior descending and
circumflex arteries. No pericardial effusion is present.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: No intra-abdominal free fluid is
seen. There is no free air. The liver, spleen, kidneys,
pancreas, and left adrenal all appear to be within normal
limits. A tiny 7-mm low-density lesion is seen in the adrenal
gland, of uncertain significance. The gallbladder is not
visualized; the extra-hepatic common bile duct appears
prominent, measuring approximately 1-cm in diameter. The aorta
is normal in caliber, with mural calcifications. The major
arteries are patent. There is some atheromatous plaque in the
aorta, but there is no evidence of dissection. In the right
lower quadrant, there is a 23 x 18 mm soft tissue lesion with a
central calcification. The appendix is not visualized. Please
note that this is non- oral contrast scan, and therefore is
limited in terms of evaluation of the bowel. The sigmoid
contains diverticulosis, without diverticulitis. The bladder
contains a Foley with non-dependent air. Distal ureters appear
unremarkable. Prostate appears slightly enlarged. No free air or
free fluid is seen in the pelvis.

There is a chronic-appearing wedge configuration of T7 and T8,
without evidence of retropulsion of fragments into the spinal
canal. There are degenerative changes throughout, with loss of
disc height at several levels including L3-4 and L4-5. L5-S1
shows mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5. There is a comminuted
fracture through the right proximal femur.

Multiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings
above.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection. Coronary vascular
calcifications noted.

2. Proximal right femoral fracture.

3. 2.3 cm soft tissue mass in right lower quadrant with single
large calcification which may represent appendicolith. Followup
study in 3 months recommended to ensure stability.

4. Mild cardiac failure.

5. 3-mm nodule and ill-defined 1-cm nodule in right upper lobe.
In the absence of known primary malignancy, followup CT scan can
be obtained in one year to ensure stability.

6. Prominence of biliary system probably related to absence of
gallbladder.

7. Calcified mediastinal lymph node which may represent prior
tuberculosis.

8. Emphysematous changes of the lungs.

Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by telephone
at 4 o'clock p.m., [**2153-4-14**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
