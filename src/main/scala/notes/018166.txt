stage IV colon cancer, status post a left colectomy with
metastases to segments 5 and 8, who presents for hepatic
segmentectomy. This patient also had a persistent pancreatic
pseudocyst after his last colectomy, and his port has been
recalled by the manufacturer. The patient presents for a
right segment 5 and 8 hepatic segmentectomy as well as a cyst-
gastrostomy and exchange of his port.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Stage IV colon cancer.
2. Hypertension.
3. Depression.
4. Status post chemotherapy.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and Paxil 20 mg p.o. daily.

HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This pleasant 48-year-old male
was admitted to hepatobiliary surgical service for routine
postoperative care. Please see the operative note by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for further information in regards to operative
technique and findings.

Postoperatively, the patient did initially well. He made good
urine output but was noted to have a low systolic blood
pressure approximately in the 80s. For that reason, the
patient was transferred to the SICU for closer monitoring.
His blood pressure appropriately responded with some IV
fluids, and a repeat hematocrit was stable. His serial
hematocrits were stable and had no further complaints. The
patient had a temperature on the evening on postoperative day
2 and simply monitored. Physical therapy was started. The
patient was started on clears and hep-locked. Had decreased
drainage in JP 1 which was the medial drain had output that
was slightly bile-tinged, where as JP 2 put out predominantly
serosanguineous to a lesser amount of approximately 70 to 90
cc per day as opposed to JP 1 which put out 360. The patient
was advanced on his diet to solid food and continued to be
monitored. He was encouraged to ambulate. On [**2186-5-13**] -
postoperative day 5 - the patient spiked a temperature again
overnight between postoperative days and 4 and 5. His central
line was removed and cultured and his medial JP was removed.
A review of his IVs were done, and there was no other
infiltrative or phlebitic peripheral line. A chest x-ray was
obtained which illustrated a retrocardiac pneumonia. His
urinalysis was contaminated but repeat was negative. He was
started on Levaquin. On [**2186-5-13**] the patient continued to
spike, and after a discussion with ID broader spectrum
antibiotics were added including vancomycin, azithromycin,
aztreonam. Please note the patient has a history of an
allergy to Zosyn, to which his reaction is hives, and
therefore the recommendations were made by ID. The patient
was continued on the antibiotics as well as the p.o. Levaquin
and monitored. He was encouraged to use incentive spirometry
and monitored. He was also noted to get a repeat a CT scan on
the evening of the 14th to evaluate for a biloma or any other
intraabdominal abscess. The CT scan failed to illustrate any
intraabdominal process that might be contributing to this
gentleman's postoperative fevers. Fortunately, at this point
his cultures were all negative. On the 17th the patient
continued to remain afebrile with stable vital signs, and he
was continued on his IV antibiotics and simply monitored. On
postoperative day 9, the patient was prepared to go home. His
IV antibiotics were stopped. The patient was resumed on his
p.o. Levaquin. Arranged for VNA services to help with drain
assistance, and his staples were removed. He was restarted on
his home p.o. medications; such as Paxil. The patient was
started on a regular diet and had no complaints and had a
clean incision on the day of discharge with no evidence of
any erythema or drainage.
