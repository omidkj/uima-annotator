History of Present Illness:
53 M with h/o GERD and active tobacco use, initially presented
to [**Hospital1 **] @ 20:30 with chest pain since noon. Pain
described as sharp, non-radiating. No associated SOB, though has
had nausea and some diaphoresis.
.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 **], ECG initially showed SR @ 70 with Qs
inferiorly, unchanged from prior. However, laboratory studies
revealed elevated cardiac biomarkers. Received ASA 325,
lopressor 5 IV, heparin gtt, NTG gtt, and integrillin gtt.

Also c/o nausea. Taken to cath lab
.
Of note, pt had been hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] in [**2102-8-5**]
with epigastric pain & vomiting at which time he was noted to
have Qs inferiorly on ECG and elevated total CK, but neg MB
fractions and neg Trop T.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

STUDIES:
ECG at [**Hospital1 **] initially demonstrated SR @ 69 w/ Qs
inferiorly (II, III, aVF) w/ <1mm STE III & aVF. Qs v3-v6.
.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**11-27**] demonstrated:
LMCA:
LAD: mild diffuse up to 30%
LCx: TO OM1 with R -> L collats to distal OM
RCA: 99% mid PDA with L -> R collats to distal vessel
.
OM1 stented with BMS x 2; Unable to cross PDA lesion.
.
.
[**2102-11-27**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall,
distal septum, distal anterior wall and apex. The apex is not
aneurysm and no thrombus is seen. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). Transmitral and tissue
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve is functionally bicuspid with fused
right and left raphe. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.
.
.
[**2102-11-29**] MRI/MRA CHEST:
1.  5.8-cm enhancing anterior mediastinal mass most suggestive
of a
low grade thymoma, but lymphoma is also a possibility.  There is
no evidence of vascular invasion.
2.  Mild fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta
to 4.5 cm.
3.  Fused left and right aortic cusps causing a functional
bicuspid aortic valve.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 M presenting with inferior STEMI s/p cath with placement of
BMS.
.
# cardiac - pt presented with symptoms, EKG changes and lab
values consistent with inferior STEMI (peak CK 5100).  He was
taken to the cath lab on HD#1 where he was found to have total
occlusion of LCx with distal R->L collaterals, and 99% distal
PDA lesions.  The OM lesions was revascularized with bare metal
stent, however unable to cross PDA.  Pt was chest pain free
after cath and had an uneventful hospital course.  He was
started on a cardiac regimen including aspirin, plavix, toprol
xl, and lisinopril.  he was discharged home on zocor [**1-6**]
insurance coverage.
.
post-MI TTE was performed revealing severe hypokinesis of the
distal half of the inferior wall, distal septum, distal anterior
wall and apex.  pt was therefore transitioned to coumadin with
plan to continue therapy for at least 3 months, until repeat TTE
could be performed to evaluate akinesis or severe hypokinesis.
He was discharged on lovenox 90mcg SC BID to be taken until INR
is therapeutic.
.
His INR will be followed by his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4**] [**2101-12-7**], at which time
he will begin being followed by the [**Location (un) 76489**]
[**Hospital3 **].  This was arranged prior to his
discharge and confirmed via phone conversation with his PCP
([**Hospital3 27239**]) and [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**
