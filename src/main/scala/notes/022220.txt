Intra-op TEE [**2182-12-13**]
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).

POSTBYPASS
LV systolic function is hyperdynamic. There is a well seated,
well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. No aortic
insufficiency is visualized. The remaining study is unchanged
from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and underwent aortic valve
replacement, see operative report for further details.  She
received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics and was taken
to the intensive care unit for post operative management.  In
the first twenty four hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
She continued to progress and was started on betablockers.  She
continued to progress.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating, but deconditioned, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
to [**Hospital3 2558**] Rehab in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
