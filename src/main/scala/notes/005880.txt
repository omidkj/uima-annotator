Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
74 YO M who was recently weaned from vent dependency brought in
from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for altered mental status s/p recent
hospitalization for left fronto-parietal ICH c/b resp failure
requiring trach. The patient was in his usual state of health
this evening at dinner but shortly thereafter he became altered.
EMS was called and found BP 80s/40s, 93% 4L, FS 140, ABG done
with pCO2 50, left IO placed for access and transferred here for
further evaluation.
.
Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with AMS secondary to
fronto-parietal ICH.  His course was complicated by respiratory
failure requiring intubation and eventual tracheostomy.  He
required PEG tube placement for extended feeding.  He underwent
treatment for VAP with vanco/cefepime/[**Hospital1 9847**], then a course of
vanco/zosyn for a urinary tract infection that grew a relatively
[**Name2 (NI) **]-sensitive proteus and enterococcus.  He had been rehabbing
at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab when he was noted to have altered mental status
today.  Of note, he developed a pruritic rash over his arms and
back two days ago, treated with topical steroids, antifungals,
and antihistamines.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98 P68 BP110/62 --> 80s --> 130s
--> 90s 79% 3L --> 95% on 4L. Exam was notable for R>L abd
tenderness to palpation and maculopapular rash on his torso.
Labs were notable for K 5.5, mild leukocytosis and UTI. CT
head/chest(CTA)/abd revealed soft tissue lesion. Vanc, zosyn and
1L NS were given. 2 PIVs were placed.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient reports no pain or adverse
symptoms.  Denies shortness of breath

Brief Hospital Course:
 Mr. [**Known lastname 90430**] is a 74yoM with recent hospitalization for
fronto-parietal ICH c/b respiratory failure requiring
tracheostomy, who presents from rehab with AMS in the setting of
leukocytosis, hypotension, and UA evidence of UTI.
.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  He presented altered from acute rehab
without clear catalyst.  Toxic/metabolic source from UTI appears
most likely.  In setting of recent ICH, CT head was pursued and
revealed no structural abnormality or bleed.  Electrolytes are
otherwise within normal limits.  No seizure activity noted.  ACS
possible given risk factors, though troponins negative.
Hypercarbia likewise possible, but his pCO2 seems to be better
than reference levels at the time of his last discharge.
Antihistamines provided in treatment of his rash can also
contribute to his AMS. Urine tox screen was negative. AMS likely
due to urosepsis.
.
# HYPOTENSION:  Patient presented with BP 80/40s from rehab,
also of unclear etiology though it was fluid-responsive in the
ED to 2LNS to sbb>100.  Urosepsis is possible given his
concerning UA and leukocytosis- no other infectious sources seen
in the lung, however abdominal CT makes note of a soft tissue
density c/w neoplasm versus diverticulitis.  PE and dissection
ruled out with CTA due to hypoxia and hypotension.  Started on
ciprofloxacin which will need to continue for total 14 days.
Holding atenolol until BP normalizes.
.
# URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  UA revealing likely UTI.  Had recent
UTI in his last hospitalization growing a relatively
[**Name2 (NI) **]-sensitive proteus and enterococcus.  Will narrow his
antibiotic spectrum to ciprofloxacin based on his previous
sensitivities. Blood and urine cultures need to be followed.
.
# RASH:  Blanching, confluent maculopapular rash over the back
and extensor surfaces of the upper arms and legs.  Appears
consistent with drug rash, though he has no peripheral
eosinophilia, and he was not recently challenged with new drugs.
A viral exanthem is also possible.  Fungal/candidal infection
appears unlikely. Rash is improving and should be followed by
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] mucosal involvment.
.
# ABDOMINAL SOFT TISSUE DENSITY: Seen on CT abdomen, of unclear
etiology: neoplasm versus possible small bowel diverticulitis.
Will need repeat CT in three weeks

# RECENT INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE:  He recently underwent
hemorrhagic stroke possibly from converted ischemic stroke
versus amyloid process.  His neurologic exam is considerably
improved compared to his discharge exam.  No further bleed seen
on admission CT Head.  Continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
.
# CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  CTA makes note of
stable emphysema. He has a substantial baseline 02 requirement
of 3.5LNC, so he is likewise at his respiratory baseline.
Exacerbation appears unlikely.  Continue albuterol and
ipratropium nebs as needed
.
# DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: he carries a diagnosis of CHF,  though
EF shown to be preserved at 50-55% per previous hospitalization.
Appears dry on exam
.
# HYPERTENSION: holding amlodipine and atenolol in the setting
of hypotension.
.

Pt admitted [**4-25**] with hypotension and responsive to 2L NS with
SBP in low 100's. NCHCT showed no acute process (final read.) CT
torso concering for possible malignancy. He will require
interval CT in three weeks. Read posted below.
-CT Torso final read: 1. No acute process of the chest.
2. Soft tissue lesion in the mesentery of the right mid abdomen
with
surrounding inflammation of the mesenteric fat is new compared
to [**2173-3-5**]. Differential diagnosis is broad and
includes carcinoid, or less likely atypical Meckel
diverticulitis, sclerosing mesenteritis, or or other neoplasms
(metastases, soft tissue sarcoma or lymphoma).
He was started on [**Year (4 digits) 9847**] for his likely urinary source and will
continue this regime pending cultures. Attempted to load with
phenytoin but pt did not tolerate [**2-24**] caustic infusion and
hypotension. Per Neuro and Pharmacy, Keppra unlikely to cause
drug rash that was present upon presentation, and given Dilantin
intolerance, started Keppra back. He was alos Guaiac negative.
Hypotension likely result of urosepsis and caused altered mental
status. At dischare pt with SBP>100 and at normal mentation.
Unclear source of rash, but it is resolving. Given h/o ICH there
was concern for an acute intracranial process, but neg CT.
  Pt now at baseline mental status and wbc 10.5 from 15.9.
