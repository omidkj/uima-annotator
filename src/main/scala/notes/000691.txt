History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15674**] is an 85 year old male with hypothyroidism, COPD,
former smoker, who presents with chest/abdominal pain and
dyspnea.  He was in his usual state of health until 2 days ago
when he developed mild dyspnea, worse on exertion.  He also
complained of mild cough at that time.  This was accompanied by
intermittent chest and back pain of unknown duration, with assoc
nausea, but no radiation of the pain, HA, or true abd pain.  He
denies any fever/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], leg pain, swelling orthopnea.  He
endorses normal Bms, urination, and appetite.  He otherwise
denies dizziness, focal numbness or weakness.  At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
patient he was mildly hypertensive and diaphoretic, and had an
EKG which was unremarkable for ischemia.  He underwent CT Abd
which demonstrated a 4.2-4.5 cm infrarenal AAA with thrombus.
No evidence of dissection or bleed.  Lungs with emphysematous
changes, no evidence of infection, PE, or edema.  He was
transferred here for further evaluation.

In the ED, T97.6, BP 121/76, HR 79, RR 17, 99%RA.  The patient
was maintained on nitro gtt with BP mostly in the 150s-160s
systolic range.  The patient was given ASA 81mg, Lopressor 50mg
PO x1, zofran x2, as well as nebulizers with good effect.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.

ROS: As per above, otherwise negative

Studies:
[**2169-4-18**] ECG - Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Premature atrial
contraction. No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2169-4-18**] ECG - Sinus rhythm. Compared to tracing #1 the premature
atrial contraction and artifact are both absent.

[**2169-4-18**] Portable CXR - FINDINGS: No definite focal consolidation
is noted. There is diffuse fine reticular interstitial pattern
of unknown chronicity. This, however, is not consistent with an
edema-like picture. There is marked tortuosity of the thoracic
aorta. The cardiac silhouette is otherwise normal in size. There
is discoid atelectasis in both lung bases, particularly the
right. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The
visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No definite acute pulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15674**] is a 85 year old male with COPD, hypothyroidism, and
a former smoker, who presented with dyspnea and chest/back pain,
and found to have an infrarenal AAA with thrombus.

# Dyspnea/Chest Pain/COPD: The patient's symptoms were
associated with exertion.  He has a history of COPD and his exam
was notable for poor air flow and wheezing. EKG and enzymes were
unremarkable for cardiac ischemia.  Chest x-ray was without
evidence of infection or edema.  CT at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] showed
emphysema and no obvious PE.  Ultimately, it was felt that his
symptoms were related to a mild COPD exacerbation and he was
started on albuterol and ipratropium nebs as well as advair.
Given his hemodynamic stability, he was transfered from the MICU
to the medical floor.  There he was started on a short steroid
burst with azithromycin as he was noted to desat to 85% on room
air with walking.  The patient's PCP's office was called an no
records of his baseline oxygen sats could be obtained.  The
following day, the patient's wheezing was still present, though
improved, and his oxygen level only dropped to 93% with
ambulation.  He was discharge with instructions to complete a
short course of steroids and azithromycin to prevent return of
his symptoms.  He was instructed to continue to use advair and
albuterol inhaler as needed.  Home VNA was arranged to check on
the patient and to ensure that he was using his inhalers
properly as he had difficulty with them initially in the
hospital.

# Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm: The patient remained
clinically asymptomatic and without any signs of rupture.
Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended blood pressure
control to SBP < 140 (the patient was hypertensive and requiring
a nitro drip initially on arrival), aspirin, and statin.  As the
patient's LDL was less than 100, statin therapy was deferred for
consideration as an outpatient.  Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was scheduled for 6 months following discharge.

# Hypertension: The patient was transitioned from a nitro gtt to
lisinopril.  His SBP remained predominantly in the 120s-130s.
He was instructed regarding the importance of taking this
medication, checking his blood pressure, and that the dose may
need to be titrated up by his PCP.

# Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on his home
levothyroxine dose.
