Chief Complaint:
Left weakness and homonymous hemianopia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV tPA [**2130-11-30**]

History of Present Illness:
89 year old right handed man with PMHx of
Afib on Coumadin, recent INR 1.2, CAD s/p [**Hospital 8466**] transferred from
an OSH s/p tPA at 1500. Patient was walking down the stairs
earlier today when he felt lightheaded. He slowly fell on the
stairs, didn't hit head, no LOC. The daughter noticed left
facial
droop and left sided weakness. The patient was taken to the OSH,
where he was found to be in aflutter, at CT was done that was
unremarkable, at 1400 his left arm drift had resolved, however
when re examined 10 minutes later it reportedly returned and he
had developed a complete left hemianopsia.   Discussion was had
with a Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], (neurocall) who examined the patient in the
teleneurology at the OSH and recommended giving tpa.  He was
given the 6 mg tPA bolus at 1500 and a 53 mg infusion at 15:02.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] further monitoring and
treatment.  Upon presentation, a code stroke was called and he
was given a score of 3, for left hemianopsia and neglect.
Otherwise he was in high spirits and had not complaints.

9:28 PM
Findings:

MRI brain:

There is an area of slow diffusion involving almost the entire
right occipital
lobe with no evidence of increased T2-/FLAIR-signal. No foci of
susceptibility
artifact to represent hemorrhage. There is no abnormal
enhancement.

There is bilateral periventricular increased T2 FLAIR
hyperintensities likely
from chronic ischemic changes. The ventricles, cisterns and
sulci are
age-appropriate. The major intracranial flow voids including
those of the
major dural venous sinuses are preserved.

No shift of the midline structures or central herniation is
identified

The orbits and globes are unremarkable. There is mild fluid in
the ethmoid air
cells, mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid sinus and fluid
in the
bilateral mastoid air cells. The visualized bones and soft
tissues are within
normal limits.


[**Month/Day/Year **] Brain:

There is an abrupt cut-off of the distal right P2 segment of the
PCA,
representing an occlusion. There is irregularity of the flow
signal intensity
of the bilateral carotid siphons but no significant stenosis.
There is focal
stenosis of the right M1 segment. The anterior cerebral arteries
are
unremarkable.

No other significant stenosis, aneurysm or vascular malformation
is
identified.

[**Month/Day/Year **] Neck:

The aortic arch, brachiocephalic and common carotid arteries are
of normal
course and caliber. T
