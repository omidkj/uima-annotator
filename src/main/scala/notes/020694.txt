History of Present Illness:
 79 yo male with h/o vascular dementia, htn, hypothyroidism who
was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] s/p multiple falls thought to be
mechanical [**1-18**] dementia.  He was transferred back to [**Hospital1 106020**] home [**7-8**] but was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] after he
was noted by NH staff be be acting out of character and being
physically abusive towards staff. He was diagnosed with PNA at
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] but was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] when the
[**Hospital1 11851**] refused to take him back before he had a psychiatry
evaluation.
.
Psychitary evaluated patient in the ED and patient was pleasant
and cooperative.  Psych felt he likely had delerium presumed
secondary to PNA, superimposed on his baseline dementia, and
recommended discharged back to [**Hospital1 11851**].
.
However, while in the ED, the patient became transiently
tachypneic and hypoxic to the 70's with with good pleth per ED
report. DDimer was found to be mildly elevated at 571 however
patient refused a CTA. He received lovenox in the ED and was
admitted to medicine on [**2160-7-12**] for further management.
.
On the medicine floor, his hypoxia was thought to be PE vs pna
vs potential mucous plugging.  However, a CXR obtained at [**Hospital1 18**]
had no evidence of pneumonia. He did not receive further lovenox
but sedation was considered for CTA.  He was continued on
Levofloxacin started at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]. Admission otherwise
complicated by suboptimal blood pressures with SBPs in 150s and
patient was started on hydralazine.   transferred to the MICU
for hypotension.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, on the medicine floor, pt hypoxia was thought to be
PE vs pna vs potential mucous plugging.  However, a CXR obtained
at [**Hospital1 18**] had no evidence of pneumonia. He did not receive
further lovenox but sedation was considered for CTA.  He was
continued on Levofloxacin started at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]. Admission
otherwise complicated by suboptimal blood pressures with SBPs in
150s and patient was started on hydralazine.

On the morning of [**7-15**], the patient was found unresponsive to
sternal rub by nursing staff at ~ 10am; a CODE BLUE was called.
Vitals afebrile, SBP 70-80s, HR 90-100s, O2 90s.  The patient
had been doing well at 8AM, received his AM medications,
including 10 mg of IV hydralazine.  SBPs had been stable
overnight in the 130s-160s prior to dosing.  During the CODE
BLUE, supplemental O2 was placed, patient was placed in
Trendelenburg, and IVF were started.  FSBG was 144.  O2
saturations remained in the high 90s on supplemental O2 but
patient remained somnolent and had minimal chest wall exertion;
he was intubated for airway protection.  Following 500 cc of NS,
SBP rose to 100s.  Following 750 cc NS total, SBPs rose to 130s.
 EKG showed sinus tachycardia without obvious ischemic pattern.


Following intubation for airwary protection, once SBPs
100s-130s, patient was coughing, uncomfortable with airway, but
also showed extensor posturing and had intermittent repetitive
movements of his RUE. He received 1 mg of ativan with resolution
of repetitive motor activity but continued intermittent
posturing.  SBPs remained stable >130 and patient was
transferred to the ICU for further management.

ICU Course:

Upon fluid resuscitation, the patient's rapid response to
minimal IVF suggested hypovolemia or neurocardiogenic causes of
AMS.  Hypotension was most likely secondary to hydralazine given
this AM although had otherwise been tolerating this medication.
Obtundation resolved with fluid resuscitation and was presumably
secondary to cerebral hypoperfusion in the setting of
hypotension.  Further IVF were held as BP stabilized and
antihypertensives were also held as hydralazine IV was likely
the cause of his earlier hypotension and subsequent CODE BLUE.
Patient was extubated in MICU and tolerated transition well.
Patient has baseline dementia secondary to vascular disease, and
1:1 sitter was present once the patient was extubated.
.
Upon transfer to the MICU, posturing on exam with repetitive
movements was concerning for seizure activity. Also the patient
was rigid and hyperreflexic on right concerning for UMN injury
more likely subacute or acute than chronic as these changes
would likely not appear immediately following insult.  CT head
was without evidence of ICH or herniation.  In the MICU, patient
had no more episodes of seizure activity or posturing.
.
The patient's O2 saturation was 98-100% s/p extubation.  Patient
had history of transient hypoxia ED with excellent oxygenation
on floor since admission.  PE was ruled out via CTA.  No
significant A-a gradient from recent ABG.  Hypoxia likely
secondary to mucous plugging as PNA was not evident on chest
imaging. Levofloxicin was continued for PNA diagnosed at OSH day
# [**3-22**] therapy in ICU, although no evidence of PNA on imaging at
[**Hospital1 18**].

Patient was advanced to a full mechanical diet in MICU.  Heparin
SC and briefly IV famotidine (during intubation) were
administered for prophylaxis.

Full work-up of hypotension was performed.  Hb was stable on ABG
at time of code.  CBC showed a drop in HCT (35.7-->41.9) since
admission to ICU but repeat HCT showed 43.8 did not suggest a
source of bleeding.  No fever, normal WBC count, clear source of
infection to suggest sepsis as a cause of hypotension.  Blood
cultures and urine were sent to be followed pending transfer to
floor.  EKG did not reveal ischemic changes; three sets of
cardiac enzymes were negative.  LFTs and pancreatic enzymes were
normal, which did not suggest an intraabdominal process.  TSH
was elevated, and T4 was sent to evaluate hypothyroidism.

Pt was transferred back to the floor where HTN was treated with
Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] until the patient obtained a bed at his
nursing home.
