Admission Date:  [**2156-12-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2156-12-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**2087-6-25**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer to Intensive Care Unit for
respiratory distress/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flare.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a pleasant
69-year-old female with a past medical history significant
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who is on 2 liters
of home oxygen (never intubated, on steroids, or home
nebulizers) who was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care
Unit from the regular floor of the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for
respiratory distress/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flare.

The patient had initially presented to her primary care
physician's office five days prior to admission with
shortness of breath and an increase in sputum production.  At
that time, a chest x-ray was done which was clear.  The
patient was started on azithromycin and a steroid taper.

The patient's symptoms worsened, so she presented to the
Urgent Care Clinic on the day of admission and she was found
to have a pulse in the 150s and a regular respiratory rate in
the 30s.

Therefore, she was immediately sent to the Emergency
Department where she received three nebulizers and
intravenous Solu-Medrol and was admitted for a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  During this time, a
computed tomography angiogram was done which was also
negative but diagnosed a left lower lobe pneumonia which was
not seen on the chest x-ray.

The patient also had an electrocardiogram which showed 1-mm
to 2-mm ST elevations in the lateral leads; which, at that
time, was thought to be secondary to demand ischemia as once
her heart rate was well controlled the patient's breathing
improved and the ST elevations had returned to baseline.
Cardiology was briefly consulted who recommended to start the
patient on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously twice per day.

Overnight on the regular floor, the patient became more
distressed and was unable to use incentive spirometry and
began to use accessory muscles for breathing requiring
frequent nebulizers.  Therefore, the Intensive Care Unit team
on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] was called for evaluation.  At that time,
it was decided that the patient would be best suited for the
Intensive Care Unit for frequent monitoring and nebulizer
treatments.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on home oxygen).
2.  Lymphoma (treated with chemotherapy 12 years ago).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Alendronate 35 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Advair Diskus one inhaler twice per day.

ALLERGIES:
1.  CODEINE.
2.  HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient used to be a smoker but quit
three years ago.  Prior to that, she used to smoke one pack
per day for 50 years. The patient denies any asbestos
exposure.  The patient also denies any alcohol or intravenous
drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 98.6
degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 106, her blood
pressure was 130/74, her respiratory rate was 24, and her
oxygen saturation was 96% on 4 liters.  In general, the
patient was an elderly and cachectic female in
moderate-to-severe respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  The
extraocular muscles were intact.  The mucous membranes were
moist.  Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds
bilaterally (left worse than right) and crackles.
Cardiovascular examination revealed first heart sounds and
second heart sounds tachycardic.  No murmurs or rubs were
appreciated.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly.  There were
positive bowel sounds.  Neurologic examination revealed the
patient was alert, awake, and oriented times three.  The
patient was able to talk but not in complete sentences
secondary to respiratory distress.  Extremity examination
revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  The patient
appeared to have good pulses and had warm extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count
was 17.1, her hematocrit was 43.9, and her platelets were
295.  Her sodium was 142, potassium was 4.1, chloride was
105, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 15,
creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 175.  Arterial
blood gas on transfer to the Intensive Care Unit revealed a
pH of 7.33, a PCO2 of 53, a PO2 of 89 (on 4 liters of
oxygen), and saturating at 95%.  A lactate level was also
obtained which was 1.7.  The patient also had three sets of
cardiac enzymes which were cycled and revealed creatine
kinase levels of 45, 47, and 52.  Her troponin T levels
respectively were 0.39, 0.43, and 0.37.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  RESPIRATORY DISTRESS ISSUES:  The patient was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit for frequent nebulizers and
continuous monitoring from her respiratory distress which was
most likely secondary to a combination of both pneumonia and
a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.

The patient was started on levofloxacin 500 mg once per day
as well as intravenously Solu-Medrol 80 mg three times per
day.  The patient was also receiving nebulizers every one to
two hours.

The patient's breathing continued to deteriorate throughout
her hospital course, and the patient was placed on [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure with settings of a pressure support
of 12 and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 to help her
breathing.  The patient did tolerate the [**Hospital1 **]-level positive
airway pressure for a couple of hours and was taken off this
and maintained with good oxygen saturations.  However, over
the course of the hospitalization the patient did not respond
as well to [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure.  At one point,
the patient was kept on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure for
as long as 24 hours to 30 hours.

During her hospital course, the patient was asked over and
over again regarding her wishes about being intubated and
being resuscitated.  The patient made it clear that she
wanted to try the [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure mask, but
if that failed the patient wanted to be made comfort measures
only.  However, this was not the plan initially as she was
noted to be a full code on admission.

Given her wishes, her sister was also called ([**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **]) and was informed of her sister's wishes of being
do not resuscitate/do not intubate.  The patient's sister
stated that if this is what the patient wanted we should
respect her wishes.

The patient completed a 7-day course of levofloxacin and was
switched over to prednisone 60 mg by mouth every day with the
intention of tapering off; hoping that her chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease would improve.  Despite
aggressive measures, the patient's breathing worsened and she
appeared to become more and more somnolent.

The patient was also unable to tolerate much oral intake.
Therefore, the patient was switched back to intravenous
Solu-Medrol 80 mg three times per day.

On the day of this dictation, the patient had completed her
antibiotic course.  At this time, the patient refused further
[**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure and is on a face mask at
this time with a goal that if she does decompensate we would
make her comfort measures only (as per the patient's wishes).

2.  TROPONIN LEAK ISSUES:  The patient initially presented to
the Emergency Department with tachycardia and was found to
have some ST elevations which had resolved once her heart
rate was controlled.  In the setting of this, the patient did
have a troponin leak which was thought to be secondary to
demand ischemia.  Therefore, the Cardiology team was
consulted who initially recommended 48 hours of Lovenox.

An echocardiogram was also obtained which revealed an
ej
