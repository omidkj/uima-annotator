History of Present Illness:
This is a 88 year old female with hx addison's, PE [**2127**], HTN,
mild AS s/p recent femur fx and ORIF p/w fevers and hypotension
from [**Hospital6 459**]. The patient underwent ORIF on [**9-26**].
She then developed renal failure, transfered to medicine
service, given IVF and tx'd for klebsiella UTI for 4 days.
Discharged to [**Hospital6 459**] on [**9-30**]. Per [**Hospital1 100**] Rebah
call in, the patient had temp 102.9, HR 110, SO2 sat 91-95% on
2L NC, BP 74/48--> 60/40 on manual BP.  Per rehab, pt was alert
and asympomatic but SBP generally       in 140-170 range, but
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 96993**] 112/60.  The patient herself is a limited historian.
She denies any complaints, no SOB, no CP, no N/V/D, no cough, no
dysuria.
.
In the ED: The pt arrived with SBP 60-70's. Given fevers, she
was thought to be septic. A CXR showed RLL infiltrate and the
patient was tx'ed with Vanc, CTX - did not receive Levoflox yet.
She received an rt IJ, 2 liters IVF and started on levophed
(small amount). CVP 6, MAP's 55. lactate 1.4. She was also
hypoxic to 88% RA, 97%2lNC. A CTA was performed showing a large
PE but no RV strain. Trop 0.2.

Imaging
Chest CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pulmonary embolism in right main pulmonary artery,
right upper
lobe and right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental arteries,
subsegmental
left upper lobe arteries, and segmental and subsegmental left
lower lobe
arteries.

2. Probable pulmonary hypertension, chronicity indeterminate.
Possible right
ventricular strain.

3. Aortic valvular calcification of unknown hemodynamic
significance.
Atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications.

4. Mild pulmonary edema.

5. Kyphosis and degenerative changes of the right shoulder.

6. Right breast calcification, should be correlated with regular
mammogram.

TTE [**10-4**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-28**],
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now slightly
lower. The right ventricle appears similar to slightly less
dilated.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 year old female with a past medical history of addison's, PE
[**2127**], HTN, mild AS s/p recent femur fx and ORIF p/w fevers,
hypotension, PE and elevated troponin concerning for PE vs
sepsis.
.
# Hypotension / Sepsis / Pulmonary Embolism: The pt arrived with
SBP 60-70's. Given fevers, she was thought to be septic.  A CXR
showed ? RLL infiltrate and the patient was treated with Vanc
and CTX initially then coverage for HAP was broadened to vanc,
zosyn, and levo.  Blood cultures show no growth to date and
urine was negative for a UTI.  As the patient was hypoxic on
arrival and has a history of PE, CTA was performed and revealed
large bilateral PE, concerning for cardiogenic shock also
contributing to hypotension.  She received an rt IJ, 2 liters
IVF and started on a small amount of levophed. CVP 6, MAP's 55.
lactate 1.4. She was also hypoxic to 88% RA, 97%2lNC. Trop 0.2.
The patient was weaned off of pressors and maintained good blood
pressures. Echo showed mild RV dilation, but only mild systolic
dysfunction, and improved pulmonary htn compared to last echo.
EKG did not show ischemic changes, but trop of 0.2 and BNP of
[**Numeric Identifier **] suggest strain.  Per cardiology IVF were stopped to avoid
volume overload and maintain a CVP 10-12. She has remained off
pressors since [**2140-10-5**] and was transferred to floor evening of
[**10-5**]. Blood pressures have been stable and O2 saturations have
improved, now satting in mid 90s on room air. Patient started on
Heparin gtt for anticoagulation for PE with bridge to Coumadin.
She was given Coumadin 5mg on [**10-5**] and [**10-6**] with INR 2.4 ON
[**10-7**] from 1.4 [**10-6**]. Since this was a rapid rise, her IN
