Brief Hospital Course:
A&P: 43 yo M w/ T1DM, ESRD on HD, HTN, depression presented to
ED with SOB in setting of volume overload [**3-20**] missing HD and
hypertensive urgency.
.
#) Dyspnea: clinical findings c/w pulmonary edema, likely [**3-20**]
missing HD and hypertensive urgency. He had urgent [**Month/Day (2) 2286**] and
admitted to the MICU.  He was ruled out for MI (baseline
elevated troponin but flat). After control of BP and HD, he had
no complaints of dyspnea. He initially required CPAP but was
soon off oxygen.  Compliance issues were addressed with the
patient, primary team, and psych consult.
.
#) HTN: He has h/o med non-compliance with other admissions for
hypertensive urgency. He was briefly on nitro gtt.  His actual
home medication regimen was investigated via communication with
his PCP's office and pharmacy; it appeared that his home regimen
was different from that which he has been put on in the hospital
on past admissions (see medication list).  For example,
clonidine is always listed as one of his home medications.
However, he is not using this at home and does not like this
side effects; he therefore discretely removes it while admitted,
resulting in rebound hypertension.  In general, he does not
trust medications not given by his PCP and will not take them
post discharge without first talking to him.
.
#) ESRD: [**3-20**] T1DM, on HD x 1.5 years. He missed HD prior to
admission (had had no HD x 5 days). He was dialyzed the first
three days of his admission and will resume his regular schedule
as an outpatient.  He expresses great frustration with HD and is
eager for renal [**Month/Day (2) **].  However, he is currently off the
[**Month/Day (2) **] list [**3-20**] unstable mental state and depression.  He
has an upcoming appointment with the [**Month/Day (2) **] psychology team.
 His phosphate binders were continued.
.
#) DM: on insulin x22y, last A1c in [**6-22**] was 7.0.  We continued
his home regimen of 70/30 with additional sliding scale coverage
which he intermittently refused to take (does not do a sliding
scale at home.)  Glucose control overall was good.
.
#) Depression: He admits to having a lot of sadness and
frustration related to multiple medical problems and the role
that hemodialysis plays in his life.  Psychiatry was consulted
(there was also concern that his missing HD was in some way a
suicidal gesture).  It was felt that his moods were more
consistent with dysthymia rather than major depression.
Mirtazepine was restarted.  He will followup with his counselor
and PCP with further referral to psychiatry through their
offices.  He will also followup with [**Date Range **] psychology as
above.
