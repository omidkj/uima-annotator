Chief Complaint:
hepatobiliary sepsis and liver abscess

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous drain placed in liver

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10940**] is an 84 year old male with a history of coronary artery
disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, PVD, and type 2 DM who was
initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**11-3**]
with hepatobiliary sepsis and possible liver abscess after
presenting with 1 week of fevers and chills, abdominal cramping,
and anorexia. He was initially admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on
[**2109-11-3**]. His initial labs were concerning for obstructive
hepatitis and biliary sepsis with elevated WBC, LFTs including
alk phos and Tbili with elevated direct fraction. He also had
elevated Trop to 0.78 and acute renal failure with Cr 2.7. He
had a 5.4 cm liver lesion concerning for abscess. He was
admitted and covered with broad spectrum antibiotics including
zosyn and flagyl. He also received NS hydration. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], labs again confirmed picture of
obstructive hepatopathy with leukocytosis to 16,000 and ARF with
Cr 2.7. Troponin was elevated here on arrival as well but CKs
were negative. Other labs revealed anemia to 32 and no evidence
of DIC. RUQ u/s here showed multiple liver lesions, largest in L
lobe concerning for abscess. Surgery was consulted and
recommended a triple phase CT scan to prep for possible
percutaneous drain placement. He was continued on zosyn and
flagyl here and also had vancomycin added.

On the evening of transfer, after returning from CT scan,
patient began rigoring, became tachycardic to the 150s,
hypothermic to 96 and then spiked a temp to 101.2. He maintained
his SBPs in 130s-140s. O2 requirement increased to 5L NC and his
skin was diffusely mottled. At the time of evaluation on the
floor, rigoring had stopped and he felt improved. However,
tachycardia persisted despite fluid bolus. He was transferred to
the ICU and upon arrival to ICU, required intubation and was
briefly on pressors. During his time in the ICU a percutaneous
drain was placed in his liver by general surgery. Eventually the
patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable enough to be
transferred to the floor.

PATHOLOGY:
[**11-4**] FNA, Liver abscess:
  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Abundant neutrophils and debris with rare group of
  epithelioid cells, probably reactive mesothelial cells

IMAGING STUDIES:

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2109-11-5**]:
1. 5-cm cystic lesion within the left lobe of the liver, with
suggestion of
internal heterogeneity. Concurrent ultrasound demonstrates
marked internal
debris and multi-septations. While this lesion is incompletely
characterized
without IV contrast, this is concerning for a hepatic abscess.
Additional
vague hypodensities in the caudate lobe may also reflect
additional abscesses.
Differential diagnosis for these lesion inludes necrotic
metastases, although
this seems less likely. The large lesion in the left lobe is
amenable to
aspiration/catheter drainage. (The latter was discussed with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] on
monday [**11-4**] at 11:46AM by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

2. Foci of air within the bladder, with a Foley catheter in
place. Several
locules of air appear somewhat peripheral in location. This may
be located
within the lumen of the bladder related to instrumentation;
however,
correlation with a UA is recommended to exclude associated
cystitis.

3. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

4. Hypodensities in bilateral kidneys, too small to
characterize.

Abdominal Ultrasound [**2109-11-4**]: Multiple, predominantly
hypoechoic liver lesions with largest lesion located within the
left lobe. Given son[**Name (NI) 493**] features, this dominant
