[**2116-8-10**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses. The LMCA,
LAD, Lcx,
and RCA had no angiographically apparent stenoses.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed an right atrial pressure of
[**12-30**]/9
mmhg, right ventricular pressure of 33/12 mmhg, pulmonary artery

pressure of 33/15/22 mmhg, and pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of
15/21/17. The left ventricular pressure was 238/24 mmhg and
systemic
arterial pressure was 176/88/116mmhg. Aortic valve gradient was
54.4
mmhg with valve area of 0.85 cm2.
3. Left ventriculgraphy was deferred

[**2116-8-7**] CXR
Lung volumes remain very low with moderate left lower lobe
atelectasis and
probable small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Mild
enlargement of
the postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Right
lung is
clear.

Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**8-14**]

HISTORY: AVR. Evaluate pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-12**]:

Lung volumes are generally improved, and left lower lobe
atelectasis
significantly cleared. Small bilateral pleural effusions
persist, probably
decreased. Postoperative cardiac silhouette, slightly enlarged,
is stable.
Lungs are clear and there is no pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3175**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-8-10**] for a cardiac
catheterization and surgical management of his aortic valve
stenosis. A cardiac catheterization revealed no significant
coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis. Please see
report for details. On [**2116-8-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname 3175**] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent an aortic valve replacement
using a poricne valve. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin
and a statin were resumed. He was then transferred to the step
down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards
his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. On POD#4 Mr.[**Known lastname 3175**] was ready for discharge to home
with VNA services. He was advised to follow up with his
PCP/Cardiologist and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
