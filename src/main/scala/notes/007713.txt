IMAGING
Multiple CT Head w/o Contrast x3
No new acute bleed or changes.
.
LENI [**2146-10-18**]
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis, either right
or left lower extremity.
.
Portable CXR [**2146-10-18**]
Pacemaker defibrillator leads terminate in the right ventricle.
Heart size is enlarged. Mediastinum is stable. Prominence of the
main pulmonary artery is consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
Vascular engorgement is noted, but no overt pulmonary edema is
noted on the current study. There is interval improvement of
left retrocardiac opacity which might be consistent with
resolution of atelectasis/infection. No interval development of
appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Small
amount of pleural effusion, though cannot be excluded.
.
IVC Filter
FINDINGS:
Normal IVC anatomy without duplication or megacava. No filling
defects.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent IVC without evidence of thrombosis.
2. Opti retrievable IVC filter placement infrarenally.
