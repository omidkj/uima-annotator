Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13256**]
Chief Complaint:
elevated creatinine on labs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Expired

History of Present Illness:
44yoM with ETOH cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, hepatic encephalopathy
and diuretic-resistent ascites admitted with an elevated
creatinine concerning for HRS.
.
The patient has a history of diuretic-resistent ascites
requiring large volume paracentesis weekly. His last
paracentesis was [**3-15**] and he had 12L removed.  He came to the
clinic today for his next weekly paracentesis and was found on
to have hyponatremia (126 basline 130) and acute renal failure
(Cr 2.2 up from baseline of 1.0-1.3 on [**3-15**]). The procedure was
performed and 4L removed. He was given albumin for a fluid
challenge to evaluate for potential HRS.  He received 100 gm of
25% albumin, 3 units FFP, Oxycodone 10mg q 4-6 hrs per radiology
paracentesis note.
.
He endorses feeling unwell with upset stomach and dyspnea for
over one week. He denies taking NSAIDS, change in diet, GI
bleed, fever/chills/dysuria. Reports stable urine output. Denies
increased PO fluid intake.
.
He has a long history of refractory hypervolemic hyponatremia
and was initiated on tolvaptan in [**2170-1-23**].  He has been
maintained on this therapy since, but has been found to be
hyponatremic during prior admissions.  In mid-[**Month (only) 1096**] he was
treated with fluid restriction with some success, but on
readmission in late [**Month (only) 1096**] again was found to be hyponatremic.
Per report his mental status was normal despite Na < 130, and
his baseline may be in the high 120s.  In the past he has not
been compliant with fluid restriction at home (up to 5L daily).

Family History:
mother's family with liver disease/ cirrhosis

Physical Exam:
44yoM with ETOH cirrhosis c/b portal HTN and diuretic-resistent
ascites presenting with an elevated creatinine concerning for
HRS also with SBP.
.
# HEPATORENAL SYNDROME:  The patient presented with an elevated
creatinine of 2.2 up from a baseline of 1.0-1.2. He was given
1gm/kg albumin for three days as well as blood products but his
creatinine continued to worsen and his urine output declined. He
was started on midodrine/octreotide. His diuretics were held...
.
#SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL PERITONITIS: Patient with diuretic
refractory ascites requiring weekly paractensis with abdominal
pain and tense ascites, underwent paractensis on [**3-25**] and found
to have 3050WBC with 87%PMN c/w SBP. He was started on
daptomycin (hx of VRE) and ceftriaxone. Peritoneal cultures
grew...
-hold ciprofloxacin prophylaxis for now,restart after ABX course
-albumin on day 3 (tuesday)
.
#PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS: RUQ U/S showed focal thrombus in the
right posterior portal vein new compared to prior. No plans for
anticoagulation.
-consider verify w/ cross section imaging
.
#DECOMPENSATED LIVER FAILURE:  The patient has advanced liver
failure secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis, now decompensated in
the setting of SBP and HRS. Transplant surgery was consulted.
.
.
.
.
#Hyperkalemia: Patient with acute renal failure and limited
urine output with potassium up to 5.6 this AM
-obtain EKG now, if ekg changes give calcium
-give kayexcelate now
-give 10 IV regular insulin and 25gmdextrose
-recheck potassium early afternoon
-renal consult
-hold spironolactone
-check PM potassium
.
# Hyponatremia:  The patient has chronic hyponatremia in the
120's-130's, likely secondary to increased renin-angiontensin
axis response due to advanced liver failure. Tolvaptan was held.
.
# Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets of 33 currently without evidence
of active bleed.  Chronic, likely secondary to advanced liver
failure and decreased platelet production.
- Trend daily
- Type and screen
.
#low back pain: chronic
-continue lidocaine patch
-continue oxycodone

Expired

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: The patient had a complicated hospital course.
His renal function continued to deteriorate despite aggressive
medical therapy with midodrine and octreotide. He became anuric
and required initiation of hemodialysis for volume and
electrolyte control. Hypotension limited the efficacy of
dialysis and, eventually, the patient required transfer to the
ICU for CVVH after aggressive resuscitation with blood products.


The patient's course was further complicated by C diff colitis,
daptomycin-induced eosinophilic pneumonia, encephalopathy, and
coagulopathy. The patient's coagulopathy was difficult to
reverse with PRBCs, platelets, FFP, and cryo. The patient had
functional DIC from severe liver disease. No systemic infection
was localized including negative cell counts for SBP, however,
the patient was still placed on broad spectrum antibiotics due
to his significant illness. The patient had episodes of
hematemesis as well, prompting transfer to the ICU. In the ICU
in spite of aggressive resuscitative measures, his severe
coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia continued with frequent
bleeding. Due to extremely poor outlook, he was made comfort
measures only and transferred back to the floor on [**2171-4-9**].

He died on [**2171-4-11**] at 19:00.
