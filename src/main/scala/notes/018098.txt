History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 75 y.o. Male w/ h.o. end stage Alzheimers dementia
(non-verbal at baseline), HTN, COPD BIBA to ED after being found
unresponsive, febrile in [**Hospital3 2558**].
.
Per ED signout and review of [**Hospital3 **] notes over the past
few years pt's baseline has been non-verbal due to his end stage
Alzheimers dementia, per family he will nod or shake his head to
yes or no questions. The pt was reported to be 'normal' during
the 7pm-11pm shift at his nursing home. This AM he was noted to
be 'unresponsive' by the nurses, febrile to 103.6, he was also
noted to be in respiratory distress with use of accessory
muscles. Nursing home called 911 and the pt was brought into the
ED
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T103.6, P125, BP 148/78, R 16, O2
sat 90% on RA, poor effort. He was noted to be in respiratory
distress with accessory muscle use, he was thus immediately
intubated with Etomidate and Succinylcholine. He was sent for a
CT head which showed no acute intracranial pathologic process,
severe global atrophy, with moderate chronic microvascular
ischemic disease. A chest xray was also obtained which showed no
consolidation but did show ETT tube placement 3cm from
bifurcation point. His initial labwork was notable for a
neutrophillic leukocytosis of 15.6. Troponin set was negative x
1. Chem panel was notable for Na 146, BUN/Creatinine 39/1.8 and
phos 2.6. Lactate level was 3.4, U/A was remarkable for pyuria,
moderate blood, small leuks, many bacteria. Following intubation
an ABG showed pH 7.40, pCO2 35, pO2 449, HCO3 23. He had a right
IJ placed in the ED. Although his U/A was suspicious for
infection the ED were concerned for an additional source of
infection; he underwent an LP with a CSF analysis showing 1 WBC
only. He was started empirically on Zosyn, Vanc, Ceftriaxone. He
was also hypotensive to the high 70s/80s and was given 4L NS, he
was also started on low dose Levophed, prior to transfer the
Levophed was running 0.08. He was started on Midazolam for
sedation.
.
Of note he was last hospitalized [**2170-7-4**] for fever and right
nsided weakness. Per discharge summary, a fever workup revealed
no clear source although diverticulitis was suspected based on
radiological evaluation.
.
Unable to obtain ROS as pt is intubated.
