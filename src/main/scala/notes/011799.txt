Brief Hospital Course:
on [**2196-3-1**], patient underwent an uneventful open Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **]
Esophagogastrectomy, apparently without complications (EBL
<300). Post-op, patient had chest tubes in place and was
transferred to the intensive care unit kept intubated for pain
control.  On POD #1, patient received 2 units of pRBCs for low
HCT and persistent hypotension.  Later that day, patient went
into AF with fast ventricular response for the first time,
ultimately responsing to an amiodorone bolus and ongoing drip,
she returned to NSR shortly thereafter.

By POD #2, patient had progressive respiratory decomensation,
and could not be extubated.  Over the next two days, oxygenation
improved and vent wean was once again tried.  As oxygenation
deteriorated, CXR became more consistent with ARDS.  Patient was
started on empirically on Zosyn for febrile episode to 102.5.
Sputum cultures would ultimately grow out pan sensitive
klebsiella, and the patient was switched to levofloxacin.  TPN
was then started, as were tube feeds through the feeding J. On
POD #6, an addittional chest tube was placed on the patient's
Right side for effusion.

Starting on POD #7, patient had to sedated and paralyzed for
agitation and poor oxygenation.  Sedation/paralysis was achieved
through various combinations of propofol, fentanyl, and
Cis-Atrocurium drips.  As ARDS continued to worsen, FiO2 and
PEEP were increased.  Patient continued to have signifigant
pressor and fluid requirments and there was ongoing concerns for
possible sepsis.  On POD#11, steroids were started for presumed
adrenal insufficiency.  This seemed to help the intermittent
hypotension, and progress was made weaning inotropic support.

Over the next several days there was growing concern about
reduced mental status.  Initially this was thought to be over
sedation in the setting of rebal failure, however, this failed
to improve with weaning the sedation.  Ultimately, a CT scan was
performed, showing no acute processes.  On POD #16, a
trachesotomy was placed  at the bedside.

By POD #17, patinet's weakness had become complete flaccid
paralysis.  A neuro consult suggested the possibility of anoxic
brain injury, but no other etiologies could be isolated.  MR of
the brain confirmed no evidence of anoxic brain injury.  EMG was
inconclusive, while EEG showed no specific cause.  Focus then
turned towards unit myopathy and other complications of
sedation.

Several attempts at weaning steroids resulted in increased BP
lability and steroids were ultimately left alone to be weaned
over a slower course.  Patient was thne fitted with a PMV which
she tolerated well.  Over the next several days, patient made
progress with trach mask, however, by POD 30, she again had
increasiung need for ventilatory support and was once again
placed on the ventilator.

Shortly after a trip to radiology for NG manipulation, patient
had a brady cardic event, evolving into full asystolic arrest.
She was succesfully resuscitated and started on a levo drip.
Empiric coverage for sepsis was once again started.  Once again,
only pathogen that was isolated was Kelbsiella pneumonia from
sputum samples.  After consulting with neurology, a muscle
biopsy was obtain from the right qudriceps.  Microscopic
examination of this confirmed unit myopathy.  The remainder of
the unit course was comp[licated only by ventillator management
and several episodes of hypotension.  Once steroid s were once
again returned to IV, these hypotensive episodes resolved, and
the patient could be gently diuresed.  Likewise, as the diuresis
progressed, progress was made with the vent wean.
