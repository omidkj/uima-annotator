History of Present Illness:
80 yo F with recent diagnosis of ovarian adenocarcinoma and a
recent PE on enoxaparin who is transferred from an OSH for a
bowel perforation.  She initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2166**]
with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting from an OSH.  A CT
scan showed a multicystic pelvic adnexal mass.  She was
diagnosed with ovarian adenocarcinoma during that admission
along with a PE and was started on lovenox.  Gyn tumor board
recommended that patient start neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  She
started carboplatin/paclitaxel cycle #1 on [**2166-3-26**] with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 19948**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], her primary medical oncologist, but developed
worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting a few days later.
She presented to an OSH and was diagnosed with free
intraperitoneal air and a retroperitoneal abscess.  Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ACS service for further evaluation.  The option for
surgery was discussed with patient and family; opted not to do
it at this time and underwent CT guided IR drainage [**2166-3-31**].
Heme-onc also consulted for febrile neutropenia on [**2166-4-1**] and
recommended starting G-CSF (Neupogen) and transfer to the
Oncology service.  Currently being broadly covered by
Vancomycin/Zosyn/Fluconazole.
.
On the floor, patient admits to some RLQ abd pain. Denies any
bloody or maroon stools prior to her dx of ovarian cancer.
.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Primary ovarian adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, grade 1.
- initially presented in [**2-/2166**] with lower abdominal pain.
- CT abd/pelvis revealed an 8.5cm multicystic pelvic mass
arising from the adnexa, as well as simple ascites.  No
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or peritoneal implants were
identified.
- Tumor markers: CA-125 of 2664, CA19-9 of 17,243, CEA of 33.
- CTA for persistent tachycardia and new oxygen requirement
revealed multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli.  Enoxaparin was
started.
- Transvaginal ultrasound guided biopsy [**2166-3-5**] confirmed
primary ovarian adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, grade 1.
GynOnc tumor board felt she was not a good surgical candidate
due to the recent PE and recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
followed by debulking surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy.
- [**2166-3-26**]: Cycle 1 of carboplatin/paclitaxel in [**Location (un) **].
