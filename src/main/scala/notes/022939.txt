Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
88 year old woman with Dementia, CHF, afib, DM2, who presented
with intracranial hemorrhage after fall from her wheelchair. She
was being wheeled down her wheel-chair ramp when she went over
the side and fell 3 feet to the ground (onto her right side).
She bumped her head but reportedly did not lose consciousness.
She was taken to an OSH where she was found to have a broken
right shoulder and a left SDH. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care. Evaluated by Neurosurg and ortho trauma,
intracranial hemorrhage and fractures deemed non-operable. NG
tube was placed, no tube feeds started, and family was awaiting
PEG placement. Transferred now to medicine/geriatrics service
for further management.

Imaging:

component about 2 cm in diameter, and also a SDH component
.
Non-contrast head CT- (interval for comparison from admission)
COMPARISON EXAMINATION: [**2141-4-3**].
There has been no change from the prior day. Again, there is a
left parietal and temporal subdural hematomas with areas of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage that are unchanged. Subarachnoid
blood is also evident in the left temporal lobe. There are areas
of subarachnoid blood also present in one of the sulci along the
right parietal lobe. There is no midline shift or mass effect. A
small hyperdensity in the anterior right frontal lobe, seen on
only a single slice could represent a small hemorrhagic
contusion within the
anterior right temporal lobe. This is best seen on series 2,
image 13. There is a mucus retention cyst in the right sphenoid
sinus.
IMPRESSION: No change from the prior examination.
.
Plain films revealing- rt. elbow fracture through olecrenon, R
clavicle fx without evidence for dislocation, grade I
spondylolisthesis of L4 on L5 and degenerative change
at L5-S1. However no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or bony
destruction.
.
CT T-spine-
Distraction of the anterior interspace at C4-5, possibly
implying a ligamentous injury.
1. Possible minimally displaced fracture of the transverse
processes of T1.
2. Multi-level degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
3. Apical pulmonary nodules, for which 12- and 24-month followup
CT
examinations are recommended to ensure stability and/or
resolution.
4. Possible thickening of the upper esophagus.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 29721**] is an 88 year old woman with Dementia who suffered a
fall from a height of three feet from her wheelchair, and was
admitted with resultant intracranial hemorrhage. She was cared
for by the trauma-service for 1 week prior to being transferred
to the medicine service for further care.  The patient's
intracranial hemorrhage was extensive, but appeared stable by
repeat CT. Her baseline functioning was reported to be
interactive with family, recognizing faces, but with expressive
aphasia.  She was continued on dilantin per neurosurgery
recommendations. Her antiplatelet agents were held in the
setting of intracranial hemorrhage. At time of transfer to the
medicine servce the pt was noted to have a UTI.  Her foley
catheter was removed, and she was treated with ciprofloxacin.
Nasogastric tube feedings were started, and plans for PEG tube
placement were discontinued pending further discussion of the
risks and benefits of the procedure. The patient was noted to be
volume deplete by exam and she was given bolus IVF's in addition
to maintenance fluids. Diuretics were held. Urine electrolytes
were sent to better assess renal function in the setting of
likely volume depletion based on serum electrolytes.
.
The following day, the patient lost IV access, and an urgent
request for PICC line was placed for purposes of IV hydration.
.
Around 5pm medicine housestaff was called that pt seemed
uncomfortable and requested morphine subcutaneous.  The
patient's vital signs at that time per report of the RN were
within normal limits.  Housestaff was later paged, prior to the
patient receiving any morphine, that the patient had expired.
The patient was DNR/DNI, and she was pronounced at 5:36pm
[**2141-4-10**].
