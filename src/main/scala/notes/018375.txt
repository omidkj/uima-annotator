Attending:[**Attending Info 8238**]
Chief Complaint:
R knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right knee debridement x2 and washout
Trans-esophageal echo and cardioversion
Electrophysiology ablation


History of Present Illness:
81 M history of AAA repair, COPD, CAD (pt denies any stents of
MIs), chronic pedal edema, right knee replacement 10 yrs ago
complicated with infection with removal of hardwear and
replacement, who is an OSH transfer for septic right knee.
Pt states that he had R knee replacement 10 yrs ago. 6 mo later
he had infected right knee. Hardware was removed,had spaced x 10
weeks. He was given IV antibiotics and had new implant later
that year and has no complicated since then.
Pt reports he was in his usual state of health until about a
week ago when started having chills. Few days later, noted right
knee pain when he stood up and "twisted" his knee. Then noted
some swelling. He came to the OSH ED where he was febrile and
found to have right septic knee. He met sepsis criteria with
fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis and was started on ceftriaxone
(day 1/1/8 in evening) and vanco (day 1=[**1-20**]). Flu swab negative,
blood cx neg thus far, UA neg. Pt had arthrocentesis on [**1-22**]
which showed frank pus. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.
Of note, throughout his hospitalization, he has been tachycardic
in the high 130s, febrile up to 103, RR 18, satting 95% on 2L.
.
On arrival to floor, pt triggered for tachycardia, Hr in the
high 140s. Sinus tach on EKG. no ST or TWI changes. Pt also
reported indigestion pain. Ambulance had given him SL nitro
which improved his heartburn pain. Pt currently feels okay, says
he has indigestion pain. No chest pain. he reports mild SOB,
currently breathing in mid 90s on 2L NC. he says his abd feels
distended, had very small bm this AM but otherwise is not having
regular bms.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was in moderate distress with
venturi mask in place. Satting 94% on venturi mask with RR of
35. He is c/o dyspnea and mild Gerd-like symptoms.

CTA CHEST [**2198-1-23**]
1. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism. However, due to
suboptimal
bolus timing, evaluation of subsegmental arteries is limited.
2. Ground-glass opacities at the right lung base, likely a
combination of
atelectasis and aspiration. Secretions in the trachea.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Bibasilar
atelectasis, right greater than left.
4. Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 5 mm. Followup
chest CT in 6
to 12 months is recommended.
5. Coronary artery and aortic valve calcifications.
6. Prominent right and left pulmonary arteries, suggestive of
pulmonary
hypertension.
7. Left adrenal adenoma.
8. Diffuse thickening of the esophagus, likely due to diffuse
esophagitis,
with a small hiatal hernia.

TTE [**2198-1-24**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved left ventricular systolic function. The TR
jet velocity suggests mild pulmonary hypertension, though the
right ventricle is not well seen to evaluate for RV
pressure/volume overload.

TEE [**2198-1-25**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage
ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta to 40
centimeters from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation
is present but cannot be quantified. No vegetation/mass is seen
on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracardiac mass/thrombus. Mildly
dilated aortic root and ascending aorta. Simple atheroma aortic
arch. Complex atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Significant tricuspid regurgitation.

CTA [**2-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Retroperitoneal bleed into the left posterior pararenal space
and into the left psoas region.
2. A rounded cystic lesion measuring 18 x 19 mm is seen,located
in proximity to the left adrenal and the gastroesophageal
junction. This might represent an adrenal adenoma or an enteric
diverticulum.

CTA [**2-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic pathology.
2. Large left retroperitoneal hematoma extending into the
pelvis, stable in extent and size since the prior study.
3. Stable left adrenal adenoma.
