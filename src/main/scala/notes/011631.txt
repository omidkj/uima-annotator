CHEST SINGLE AP FILM

HISTORY: CHF.

The left costophrenic region is not included on the film. There
is cardiomegaly with LV predominance and some blunting in the
left costophrenic angle. A left-sided transvenous
pacer/fibrillator is present with atrial ventricular and
coronary sinus leads in situ unchanged in location in this
single view and compared with the prior study of [**2165-5-2**].

Brief Hospital Course:
# Recurrent VT: The patient had VT that was very difficult to
control with the many antiarrhtymics tried. Initially he was
placed on procainamide which was useful for his VT because
caused him to have serious N/V with hypotension.  Therefore, he
was switched to lidocaine but still had VT runs with ICD firing.
Finally he underwent a
VT ablation on [**1-7**] with 2 foci ablated. 3rd foci not ablated.
He was restarted on amiodarone 400 qd and was stable with only
occasoinal runs of NSVT.

# ARF on CRI s/p nephrectomy - The patient was thought to have
nre renal failure from epidosed of dehydration and hypotension
from VT and nausea and vomiting. Renal was consulted. The
patient underwent a renal ultrasond of his transplant which was
unreavealing. Slowly her Cr trended downwards.
