History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 805**] is an 82 year old man with history CHF, afib
presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with worsening fatigue and dyspnea of five
days duration. He denied sputum production, coughing, orthopnea,

Brief Hospital Course:
82M with Parkinson, Afib, CHF presented with fever, hypoxia
(concnering for PNA), and pancytopenia (concnering for DIC, TTP,
or immune vs drug vs idiopathic thrombocytopenia) and also
incidental pancreatic ductal dilation. Regarding his fever and
hypoxia, levo and flagyl were given for three days without
clinical improvement. Interval CXR and CT both showed worsening
bilateral upper lobes opacities concerning for pneumonia, as
well as lower lobe consolidation, which could be either
pneumonia and/or worsening CHF. There was also worsening
bilateral pleural effusion. He spiked several fevers up to
101/102 in the first two days; meanwhile, his BNP was nearly
three times the upper limit of normal. He was also becoming more
oxygen dependent, requiring 4L to achieve a saturation of 94%.
Taken altogether, the thinking was that during the first three
days since admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 805**] had worsening pneumonia
complicated by worsening CHF, and the bilaterality and worsening
nature of his pulmonary findings were also concerning for
development of ARDS. On the fourth hospital day, the antiobiotic
coverage was modified to Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Flagyl. He
did well throughout the day on these antibiotics, and was
afebrile overnight. His respiratory rate remained high, and he
still required 50% of oxygen overnight. Given his increasing
demand for oxygen, the team felt that BIPAP would be appropriate
for him, even though he is clinically improving as far as his
infection is concerned. He was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in the
morning of [**7-25**].  On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was
evaluated for possible non-invasive ventilation due to his
DNI/DNR status, but BiPAP was declined. Mr. [**Known lastname 805**] was placed
on high flow oxygen by facemask, but remained in marked
respiratory distress.  Initially, the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] plan for Mr. [**Known lastname 805**]
involved continuation of his antibiotic regimen and other care
from the floor.  However, on further discussion with his HCP and
his family, it was decided that Mr. [**Known lastname 805**]' level of care
would be switched to comfort measures only.  He was started on
morphine for pain, titrated to comfort, and oxygen by face mask
was continued at the HCP's request.  Mr. [**Known lastname 805**] passed away at
0510 on [**2174-7-26**] due to respiratory failure likely caused by his
pneumonia an/or CHF.

Other issues during Mr. [**Known lastname 79133**] included initial
lab work that was concerning for acute on chronic anemia and
recent onset thrombocytopenia (was 160 thousands a month ago,
and now presented with 40 thousands). Given the low haptoglobin,
elevated indirect bilirubin and LDH, fibrin degradation product,
and D dimer, the data was concerning for chronic DIC. TTP was
ruled out on the basis of two smears that showed no
schistocytes, according to heme/onc consultation. Chronic DIC
maybe be due to malignancy, and a CT of head/chest/abd/pelvis
was performed, which showed a pancreatic duct dilation now at
11mm (was 9mm on admission), with a hypodense lesion a the
uncinate process of the pancrease concerning for adenocarcinoma.
 For other details during Mr. [**Known lastname 805**]' stay, see below.

1. Hyponatremia: Mr. [**Known lastname 805**] presented to the floor with a
sodium of 129. He was fluid restricted to 1200cc a day, with
gentle diuresis with IV bolus Lasix. His worsening CHF, along
with clinical exams (such as elevated JVP and peripheral edema)
suggest that he was fluid overloaded from systolic CHF, and the
kidneys are avidly holding on to the sodium. His hyponatremia
resolved following two days of fluid restriction and diuresis.

2. Parkinson's disease: not an active issue during this stay; he
was treated with outpatient medication.

3. History of Atrial flutter and atril fibrillation: not an
active issue. Coumadin was not given due to thrombocytopenia.
EKG on admission was in sinus rhythm.

4. Coronary artery disease: aspirin was withheld due to
thrombocytopenia.
