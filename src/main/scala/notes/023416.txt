Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy, video enteroscopy, tagged RBC scan.


History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with CAD s/p CABG in '[**15**] and repeat Cath with known 3vd
with one failed graft, as well as afib on coumadin and previous
hx of GIB of unknown origin presents with anemia. The pt reports
he has been feeling weak and short of breath over the last
5-7days. He had noted DOE - inability to ambulate more than 10
steps without getting short of breath or weak in the arms and
legs. He had previously been able to ambulate more than one
block prior to onset of sx. The pt also reports LH, dizziness,
orthostasis and generalized fatigue as well as increased sx of
palpitations. He had previously had brown stool however since
initiation of Iron supplementaion one week prior, he had since
had black stools. The stools are described as formed and without
significantly different odor than previous. He denies any chest
pain, sob at baseline or n/v, diaphoresis. He also denies any
abd pain or change in appetite. He also denies any f/c/r, night
sweats, weight loss. No use of NSAIDS. The pt had presented to
his PCP yesterday at which time, he was found to have a Hct of
21 and subsequently he was referred in to the ED.
.
In the ED, the pt was found to be intermittently hypotensive to
SBP of 80s. He was neither tachycardic nor symptomatic with
these BPs. PE was significant for no significant hemorrhoids on
ext exam but brown guaiac positive stools with streaks of blood.
2 large bore IVs were placed, the pt was typed and crossed
4units and started on 2units of PRBC as wellas 2000L of NS. He
was also given 2mg Vitamin K sub Q for an INR of 2.8 as well as
protonix 40mg IV x1. The GI fellow as called and given his
previous negative EGD/Colonoscopy as well as capsule study,
suspicion was low for an UGIB. In addition, as he had an
elevated INR, a NGL was deferred until the AM. The pt was
transferred directly to the MICU.

Physical Exam:

GEN: Pale well nutritioned male in NAD, conversing fluently in

Rectal exam (as per verbal report from ED resident): no
hemorrhoids on external exam, rectal tone OK, brown stool,
guaiac positive with some streaks of blood.
Skin: occasional cherry hemangiomas as well as multiple skin
tags especially over back of neck, chest and axilla. no
acanthosis nigricans
Neuro: A+O x3


Pertinent Results:
capsule endoscopy: 1. Dark blood in the duodenum 2. Distal small
bowel obscured by dark blood 3. Etiology of bleeding cannot be
determined due to obscured mucosa.
.
tagged RBC scan: No evidence of active GI bleeding.
.
c-scope: Moderate amounts of old black stool were noted
throughout the colon. The black stool could be because of blood
or old iron. Similar material was noted in the terminal ileum,
suggesting that if is blood, the source is most likely small
bowel. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum.
.
EGD: Normal push enteroscopy to mid-jejunum.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 74yoM, hx of GIB 1 yr. ago without clear etiology identified
after EGD, colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy. Presented to PCP
with complaint of fatigue and malaise, found to have Hct 21,
sent to ED.  Received total of ~10U of PRBCs during entire
hospitalization.  Hct finally stabilized without intervention,
presumably bleeding stopped. Pt. noted to have persistent black,
guaiac positive watery stools.  He underwent capsule endoscopy,
EGD, and colonoscopy, and tagged RBC scan, all of which were
essentially negative; GI believed however, that the bleed might
be originating from the duodenum based on review of the capsule
study.  Pt. was continued on PPI, and his ASA and coumadin (for
Afib) were held.  Will need to discuss with his PCP/cardiologist
whether to restart coumadin in setting of 2 recent GI bleeding
episodes.  Beta-blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were initially held so as not to
mask reflex tachycardia in the setting of a bleed, BB was
restarted upon discharge.  [**Last Name (un) **] can be restarted as outpt. if
necessary.
