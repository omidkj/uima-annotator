Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
Subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. External ventricular drain placement
2. Cerebral aneurysm coiling

History of Present Illness:
76yo RHF fell/found down in her kitchen, no apparent
traumatic injuries, taken to [**Hospital3 **] ED where NCHCT revealed
Grade V SAH.  Pt  reportedly developed pupillary assymetry with
dimished reactivity and decerebrate posturing thus was
intubated,

intermittent decerebrate posturing and pupillary assymetry.

ON DISCHARGE:
Vital signs stable, AOx2, able to move all four extremities
spontaneously, following commands.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT ([**2124-2-24**]): 1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and
intraventricular hemorrhage as described. No focus of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage identified. 2. Diffuse brain
swelling as evidenced by obliteration of the sulci.
Cerebral Angio([**2124-2-24**]):Left vertebral artery arteriogram
demonstrates normal filling of the left vertebral artery along
with the left vertebral artery and its branches. The basilar
artery and its branches including both posterior cerebral
arteries and SCA and AICA are seen with no evidence of any
aneurysms. There was no reflux into the right vertebral artery,
however, we had information from the CT angiogram that we
decided not to study, the right vertebral artery.

Left common carotid artery arteriogram shows normal bifurcation.
The left external carotid artery and its branches fill well. The
left internal carotid artery fills well along its cervical,
petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion. The anterior
cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery are seen normally
with no evidence of aneurysms or arteriovenous malformation.

Right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows right posterior
communicating artery aneurysm measuring approximately 7 x 5 mm
with what appears to be a daughter sac which seems to be at the
fundus of the aneurysm. The right internal carotid artery fills
well along its cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid
portion. No stenosis seen. The middle cerebral artery and the
anterior cerebral artery are seen normally. The anterior
communicating segment is also seen with no evidence of aneurysms
at this location.

Post-coiling right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows
near complete obliteration of the aneurysm with a small residual
filling of the aneurysm at the neck of the aneurysm.

Right aortic bifurcation arteriogram shows normal filling of
both common iliac and its distal branches.

The below examinations are the most recent examinations prior to
d/c
Head CT ([**2124-3-10**]): IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the brain
with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, aneurysm clip, and
intraventricular blood.

Angio([**2124-3-3**]): IMPRESSION: Successful cerebral angiogram
performed on Ms. [**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 77254**]. No significant vasospasm is
identified on this study, which signifies interval resolution of
the vasospasm.

Chest XR([**2124-3-14**]) Compared with [**2124-3-14**], the ET tube, NG tube, and
right subclavian line have been removed. A tracheostomy tube is
now present. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
There is hazy opacity at the right base suggestive of a small
layering effusion and associated atelectasis. There is minimal
atelectasis at the left base. Rounded opacity at the left base
is noted, most likely represents a nipple shadow. Heart size is
mildly enlarged. No CHF is identified. No new infiltrate is
detected.


Brief Hospital Course:
76yo with large SAH (Grade V) transferred emergently from
referring hospital intubated with pupillary assymetry and
intermittent decerebrate posturing. Given extent of SAH and
declining neurological status, EVD placed in ED without
complication. Pt found to have right p-comm aneurysm thus taken
to angiography suit  for aneurysm coiling. Pt tolerated
procedure well with no complications (please see dictated op
note for full details). Post procedure pt admitted to Neuro ICU
with Nimodipine, daily ASA, Dilantin 100mg IV q8h, let BP
autoregulate for now with SBP goal <160, EVD@10cm, open.
.
On POD#1, pt extubated, was alert, oriented to person and
"hospital" and could move all four extremities purposefully and
to command.  On POD#2 pt developed hyponatremia to Na=129, this
was likely from cerebral salt wasting and pt was treated with
normal saline IVF. [**2124-2-28**]: CTA was stable with a corrected
dilantin level of 8.3. On [**2-29**], she became less responsive and
was allowed to have the BP rise.  Corrected dilantin level was
7.4 and was bolused 300mg. She also had another angiogram done
today that showed some vasospasm.  [**3-1**] the angiogram was
repeated and demonstrated less vasospasm, she also received
papaverine, and the nimodipine was decreased. [**3-3**], angiogram
was again repeated showing no new spasm. On [**3-4**], a RLE
ultrasound showed a pseudoaneurysm off the right CFA, which was
treated on [**3-7**] with an ultrasound guided thrombin injection. EVD
clampedx2, and she passed the clamping trial, her EVD was
removed.  [**3-14**] she underwent trach and peg.  [**3-16**] she was able to
be taken off the ventilator to breath on her own. [**3-17**], her
central line was removed and transferred to stepdown.  [**3-18**] she
was transferred to floor status after tolerating 24hours of step
down.  Nimodipine was discontinued on day 21.  She also had an
increase in her WBC and a urinalysis was performed and she was
determined to have a UTI.  She was then started on cipro for
treatment of this.
She completed a course of Diflucan for vaginal candidiasis.  On
today, this day of discharge, her mental status is greatly
improved.  I suspect whe will tolerate and pass a speech and
swallow eval as well as may be able to have her trach
decanulated.
