History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a  64 y/o female with a history of stage IV lung
cancer that was first diagnosed on [**2168**] and treated at that time
with chemoradiation therapy. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital 8641**]
Hospital on [**2173-1-12**] for progressive cough and weakness and
was found to have an enlarging right hilar mass, with associated
pleural effusion and a thoracentesis that yielded positive
cytology. She was considering palliative chemotherapy, but
unfortunately she has become progressively weaker, with
increasing and disturbing cough - productive of sputum lately,
and with worsening dyspnea. She denies any fevers or chills. She
was started on antibiotics (Zosyn) at OSH for a possible
postobstructive pneumonia.

During her hospital stay in [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital she was also found
to have recurrent SVTs with reentry, atrial flutter/fibrillation
in/out that had been partially responsive to iv diltiazem. These
have been completely asymptomatic and have improved considerably
with beta blockage. She denies any chest pain.

She is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]/Interventional Pulmonology
service for evaluation of her airway and possible stent or other
symptom relief procedure.


Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Rheumatoid arthritis
Lung cancer - stage IIIb NSCLC, which has been in remission for
three years.  She was treated with chemotherapy and radiation
only.

SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has had both hands operated on for
ligamentous issues secondary to her rheumatoid arthritis.  She
has also had her right foot reconstructed secondary to
rheumatoid
arthritis in [**2164**].  She has also had two biopsies, one from the
right clavicle and one from her right lung.


Social History:
The patient is unsure of her ethnicity background.  She is a
bookkeeper/cashier.  She used to smoke tobacco, but quit
approximately three years ago.  She does not drink alcohol.


Family History:
Significant for cancer of her father and two brothers, all lung
cancer.  Also, lung disease in general runs in the family.


Physical Exam:
VS 99.8  84  108/66  20  99 3.5L NC
Gen: NAD, A&O x3
CV: RRR
Chest: b/l diffuse wheezes, decreased BS at right base
Abd: soft, nondistended
Ext: WWP

Pertinent Results:
CT chest [**2173-2-26**]:
1. Following bronchus intermedius stent placement, persistent
airway obstruction distal to the stent, with minimally
aerosolized material, as well as encasement/marked narrowing of
the right pulmonary artery. Pronounced post- obstructive
collapse of the right middle and right lower lobe, which has
increased from the prior study. Pronounced volume loss is
evidenced by increased rightward mediastinal shift and elevation
of the right hemidiaphragm. Close followup is warranted.
2. Interval decrease in right pleural fluid following placement
of pleural
catheter at the right lung base.
3. Unchanged appearance of right suprahilar consolidative
opacity and right upper lobe and anterior left upper lobe lung
masses.
4. Stable appearance of hepatic cyst and small hepatic lesions
in the right lobe.

Chest x-ray [**2173-2-27**]:
The mediastinum is currently more centrally positioned with
better aeration of the right lung that might represent overall
improved aeration of the right lung. Still present right
perihilar consolidation and right basal consolidation represents
a combination of known lung cancer, atelectasis and potentially
post-obstructive infection. The Pleurx catheter on the right has
been slightly repositioned. The left lung is unremarkable. There
is no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-2-24**] and underwent
flexible bronchoscopy on [**2-25**] which deomonstrated tumor invasion
of the right mainstem bronchus and right bronchus intermedius.
She was continued on unasyn for treatment of presumed
postobstructive pneumonia and an admission WBC of 17.  On [**2-26**]
she underwent mechanical debridement and cryotherapy of the
airway with placement of a 12 x 20mm stent as well as placement
of a right sided PleurX catheter into the right pleural space.

On [**2-28**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy for further tumor
debridement and was taken back later that day for flexible
bronchoscopy and further tumor debridement a second time.
Postoperatively she was tachypneic and tachycardic and O2
saturations were transiently in the 50%s on room air; she was
placed on CPAP noninvasive ventilation and O2 saturations rose
quickly to the high 90%s. ABG at that time revealed significant
respiratory acidosis with 7.13/80/71, and she was planned for
admission to SICU.  After several minutes of CPAP her ABG
improved to 7.37/39/126, and upon admission to the SICU she was
transitioned off the CPAP to face mask.

Overnight she did well, however CXR in the AM of [**3-1**]
demonstrated collapse of the right upper lobe and a right
pleural effusion.  Her PleurX catheter was drained and she had
some symptomatic relief of symptoms.  She also underwent a
flexible bronchoscopy at the bedside which reportedly did not
reveal any abnormality, with the stent in good place.

She was evaluated by the radiation oncology department during
this hospitalization.  Given that she had completed 36 Gy of XRT
in the past, she was deemed not a candidate for Cyberknife,
however she could potentially undergo conventional
re-irradiation.  The patient and her family discussed her
options with radiation oncology as well as interventional
pulmonology, and she decided, given her grim prognosis, to
transition to a hospice approach to her care, with the intention
to go home as soon as possible.  Her wishes to be DNR/DNI status
were confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and on [**3-2**] she was transferred
from the ICU to the regular floor.

On [**3-3**] she was transferred to the floor.  Her WBC count was
down to 13 and she was afebrile throughout the admission.  She
was transitioned to PO augmentin for a total 14-day course of
antibiotics, and he was sent home for transition to home
hospice.
