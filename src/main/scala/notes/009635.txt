Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line placement X2


History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with CAD, CHF, COPD presenting with altered
mental status, hypoxia and fever. The patient was hospitalized
from 3/4/08-3/ /08 at an OSH for increased shortness of breath.
She was treated for CHF exacerbation with diuresis and
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for rehabilitation. Per her daughter, she
was improved after her hospital stay and was alert and
appropriate at discharge to [**Hospital1 **]. She did also report that
her mother was weaker at the rehabilitation facility and had
difficulty participating with physical therapy.
.
On the day of admission, the patient had a fever of 101.5. She
was given levofloxacin 500 mg po X 1.  Later that morning, she
was found to be hypoxic with abg of 7.36/61/49 on 3L NC. She was
started on BiPAP 19/6 and her oxygenation improved to 92-93%.
Her family noted that her mental status was very poor, as she
was not responding to voice, but only withdrawing to pain.  She
was taken to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Upon arrival to the ED, the patient was being bagged by EMS and
was rapidly put on BiPAP.  Her initial vitals were 100.1 83
130/33 27 and 99% on bag.  In the ED, her temperature (rectal)
was 102.8 and she was given 1 gram of Tylenol, 1 gram of
vancomycin, 750 mg of Levofloxacin and 4.5 g of Zosyn.  She was
maintained on BiPAP throughout her course and had an NGT placed
for abdominal distention.  Her mental status improved slightly
and she was sent to the ED for further management.  Of note, she
also became slightly hypotensive to 84/33 and responded to
101/36 with 200 cc NS.
.
The patient was hypotensive upon arrival to MICU to 65/20.
Goals were addressed with the patient's daughter and she was
aggressively hydrated with minimal improvement in BP.  BiPAP was
removed, however, her pressures did not respond.  Arterial
catheter placed and SBP 92/60, improved to 104/70.  There was
signficant discrepancy between the arterial line pressures and
the cuff pressure.  Through her daughter, the patient denied
chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain, she does not
like the BiPAP mask.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD: s/p 4-vessel CABG [**2119**]
2. CHF: ECHO [**1-4**] w/ 1+ MR, minimal AS, EF 40% w/ regional wall
motion abnormalities
3. DM Type 2
4. HTN
5. COPD: on home O2 3.5L/m, BIPAP (settings 14/10) with multiple
past admissions w/ pCO2 in the 70-80 range
6. Schizophrenia: initially symptomatic w/ paranoia and
hallucinations, well controlled w/ meds
7. L3 fracture: [**2127**]
8. Symptomatic VT: s/p ICD in [**1-3**]
9. Hypothyroidism

Social History:
lives alone in [**Hospital3 **] apartment; has home health aide
daily; meals are prepared by the pt's daughter; walks
independently but sometimes uses walker; uses home O2 at all
times and BiPAP at night; smoked 60 pack-years but quit in [**2123**];
no alcohol, IVDU, or cocaine use.

Family History:
CAD: mother died of MI at unknown age

Physical Exam:
vitals: 101.8, 63/41, 72, 17, 99% BiPAP
Gen: opens eyes to sternal rub, farsi speaking, no distress,
loud/coarse snoring sounds when asleep, resolve when awake
HEENT: on BiPAP, EOMI
Car: RRR
Resp: coarse bilat with most sounds around central airways. no
crackles ant/lat
Abd: distended, tympanic, nontender, + BS
Ext: no edema

Pertinent Results:
1. Initial CXR: Left retrocardiac density may represent
atelectasis or early pneumonia. Recommend dedicated PA and
lateral view for further evaluation
.
2. CXR ([**4-6**]): Worsening bilateral perihilar opacities worrisome
for worsening mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema which might be
accompanied by bibasal aspiration.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72 year old female with CAD, COPD, CHF and obesity
hypoventilation syndrome presenting with fever, altered mental
status and hypoxia.
.
1. Fever: and leukocytosis with left shift: treated for
HAP/bronchitis with vancomycin/zosyn. She had an unimpressive
CXR but had thick copious secretions.  Sputum culture with GPC.
She had an isolated positive blood culture from admission, but
surveillance cultures were negative.  She had a negative
influenza DFA.  Plan for 8 day course of antibiotics to continue
until [**4-13**].  PICC line in place, but should be pulled after
antibiotics completed.
.
2. Altered mental status: likely related to fever and build up
of CO2 from underlying infectious process. Her mental status
waxed and waned in the ICU and did not correlate with her CO2
level. She tended to improve with BiPAP, but this was not
necessarily consistent.  Likely related to antipsychotics,
baseline psychiatric disturbance and hypercarbia. Improved by
discharge.
.
3. CHF: given bolus fluids for hypotension at arrival to MICU.
She was intermittently diuresed with lasix during this
hospitalization.  Last EF >55%.  Continued on beta blocker only.
 At the OSH, she had started on Diovan, this was discontinued
for borderline-low BP. According to the notes, she has been
tried on ACE-i in the past but these have been stopped because
of blood pressure concerns. She was discharged on her
pre-hospital dose of Lasix.
.
4. ARF: baseline 0.9-1.0. Acute renal failure at admission
likely from low flow state. This improved as her fluid balance
corrected.

5. Schizophrenia: home depakote, abilify and risperdal. Continue
Zoloft.  Abilify given in the morning improved her mental
status, also had decreased dose of Risperdal.
.
6. CAD: aspirin + lipitor + beta blocker.  The patient had
intermittent episodes of angina, responsive to SL NTG. On
discussion via interpreter, the patient has had chronic stable
angina since her bypass surgery and uses sublingual
nitroglycerin every other day at home.
.
7. DM: home medications held at admission as pt NPO.  She had
been discharged on Lantus and SSI from OSH, but these are not
normal medications for her.
.
8. COPD: continue spiriva, advair and nebs prn.  Patient
requires Bipap at night (variable but 14/10 most recently) and
supplemental oxygen (3-6L NC).
.
9. Hypothyroidism: continue levoxyl
.
10. FEN: diabetic diet
.
11. Access: PIV and a-line
.
12. Disposition: MICU
.
13. Code: DNI. Daughter consents to lines, pressors, CPR and
patient has ICD.
.
