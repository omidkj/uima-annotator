RESPIRATORY:
[**2109-10-25**] Bronchoscopy: Left lower lobe full of thick mucoid
secretions which were sent for microbiology, trachea with normal
anatomy and some secretions, left upper lobe washed with washing
sent for pathology, thick secretions in the right lower lobe
[**2109-10-27**] Bronchoscopy: Patent trachea, thick mucous plug
obstructing the left mainstem bronchus (removed and sent for
culture), patent left upper lobe, purulent secretions in left
lower lobe, patent right mainstem/upper lobe/ lower lobe

RADIOLOGY:

[**2109-10-18**] Chest CT:
1) Status post placement of two left-sided chest tubes, which
are  appropriately placed within the pleura. There has been
interval decrease in  the degree of loculated pleural fluid,
although a significant amount remains  with some irregular
thickening of the pleural space/fluid.
2) A spiculated lung mass is now seen at the left lung apex,
with enlargement  of AP window and precarinal lymph nodes. These
findings are highly suspicious  for malignancy.
3) Significant bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis, with
endoluminal secretions. There has been interval endoluminal
obstruction of the right lower lobe bronchus due to secretions,
with some degree of atelectasis as well as a small pleural
effusion which has developed in the interval.

Further Studies:
*ECHO [**10-25**]- EF 60%, normal walls, mild PA HTN (30mmHg), no
effusion, no vegetations
*CT Chest [**10-28**]- patchy opacities assymm in both lungs, most
suggestive of multi-focal pna, bulky intrathoracic
lymphadenopathy, irregular pleural thickening adjacent to left
mediastinum with nodular left diaphramatic pleural thickening. ?
[**1-14**] malignant process; moderate pericardial effusion;
intermediate L. adreanal lesion. L.sided pleural efusion has
decreased in interval with improved aeration of l. lung. R
effusion has slightly worsened.
*L ARm u/s ([**2109-10-31**])- no evidence of DVT
*CXR [**11-1**]- b/l effusions, multifocal pna
*CXR [**11-2**]- No significant interval change in the bilateral
pneumonia

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Overview of Hospital Course:

82 y/o female with chronic b/l lower lobe bronchiectasis with
frequent LLL pneumonia. Originally admitted to OSH on [**2109-10-8**]
for LL pna. she was treated with clindamycin, zosyn,
azithromycin. Had CT chest on [**2109-10-12**], which showed loculated
pleural effusions. She also had a thoracentesis performed at OSH
which was c/w exudative effusion. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for VATS decortication which was done on [**2109-10-15**] by the thoracic
surgery service. Initial culture of empyema grew out rare strep
milleri which was treated w/ IV PCN G. The pt had a persistent
leukocytosis despite tx w/ abx. She was evaluated for repeat
thoracentesis w/ U/S on [**2109-10-22**] but no tappable fluid was seen.
She underwent bronchoscopy on [**2109-10-25**] for diagnosis of LUL
lesion seen on repeat CT scan. Left upper lobe was washed with
washing sent for pathology. This showed atypical squamous cells
(uncertain significance-needs biopsy for further evaluation). At
the same time, the left lower lobe was found to be full of thick
mucoid secretions which were sent for microbiology. These grew
out 2+ GNR's. Antibiotic regimen was changed to levofloxacin and
meropenem on [**2109-10-27**].

On [**10-29**], she developed acute increased work of breathing and
inability to clear her respiratory secretions , so she was
intubated emergently and transferred to MICU. At that time,
surgery did not feel that any further surgical intervention was
indicated.  While in MICU [**Date range (3) 57198**] she was treated with
aggressive pulmonary toilet. Vanco was started for emperic MRSA
coverage. Final cultures from [**10-25**] bronchoscopy returned as
Klebsiella pan-sensitive, so she was weaned to Levof
