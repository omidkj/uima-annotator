Admission Date:  [**2168-12-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2168-12-11**]


Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
woman with multiple medical problems as listed below
including recurrent pancreatitis attributed to microlithiasis
who was in her usual state of health until the day prior to
presentation when she developed abdominal pain, radiating to
her back and side and had some nausea.  She was brought to
the Emergency Department where she was found to have
laboratory values consistent with pancreatitis (as summarized
below).  Nasogastric lavage was also performed and occult
blood was present in the form of coffee ground.

In the Emergency Department, the patient received
Pantoprazole 40 mg intravenously 1.5 liters of normal saline
bolus, nitroglycerin 0.3 mg sublingually and Ondansetron 12
mg intravenously.  The patient was initially slated for
admission to the Medical Service, however, the presence of
upper gastrointestinal bleeding prompted admission to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

Evaluation of cardiac markers in the Emergency Room also were
suggestive of acute myocardial infarction.  The patient was
seen by the Cardiology Service and reiterated her desire to
not undergo coronary angiography as described in her previous
discharge summary.  She received intravenous heparin, Aspirin
and Clopidogrel.  Shortly thereafter she had an episode of
coffee ground emesis with nasogastric lavage as described
above.

1.  Aricept 10 mg daily
2.  Aspirin 81 mg daily
3.  Glipizide 20 mg twice a day

5.  Levothyroxine 75 mcg daily
6.  Atorvastatin 10 mg daily
7.  Lisinopril 10 mg daily
8.  Nitroglycerin 0.6 mg as needed

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Pancreatitis, she has had several
episodes since [**2168-8-1**].  She was initially scheduled

meet her appointment and as described below has refused to
have further evaluations.  2.  Coronary artery disease, the
patient had a myocardial infarction in [**2168-8-1**],
however, she and her family declined angiographic evaluation.
Her last echocardiogram showed a systolic congestive heart
failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 to
40% with apical left ventricular aneurysm and diffuse wall
motion abnormality.  The left ventricle was 1+ aortic
insufficiency.  3.  Type 2 diabetes controlled with oral
Sulfonylurea as described above.  4.  Mild Alzheimer's
disease for which she received Aricept as described above and
Quatiapine for sleep.  5.  Hypothyroidism, stable regimen
with replacement as described above.  6.  Hypertension, well
controlled with an ACE inhibitor.  7.  Recurrent urinary
tract infection.  8.  Symptomatic bradycardia necessitating a
DDD cardiac pacemaker placement.  9.  Colon cancer at age 78,
status post surgical resection, there no radiation or
chemotherapy performed.  10.  Previous right-sided stroke.
11.  Hysterectomy.

LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation the white blood cell count
was 8,100, hemoglobin 12.5, hematocrit 37.7, platelets 293.
Mean corpuscular volume was 93 semptolitiers.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.4, chloride 105, blood urea nitrogen
36, bicarbonate 23, creatinine 1.2, glucose 236, calcium
10.6, magnesium 2.0, phosphate 2.4.
ALT 13, AST 31, alkaline phosphatase 77, total bilirubin 0.2,
albumin 4.1, lactate dehydrogenase 180, lipase 2,434 (when
assessed 8 hours lipase was 5,335 and amylase was 1315), TSH
6.5, creatinine kinase 50, troponin T 0.06.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm of 70 beats/minute with
PR interval of 0.2, QRS was 0.15 with old right bundle branch
block, QT was 0.4 with an axis of 0 to -30 degrees and early
R wave progression.  There were unchanged ST-T segment
elevations in the inferior lead 2, 3 and AVF as well as
dynamic T wave inversions in that lead, there were stable T
wave inversions in anterior and precordial leads V1 through
V3.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heart failure or
pneumonia.
Computed tomograph of the abdomen showed fat stranding around
the pancreas consistent with a laboratory evaluation
described above.  There was no evidence of biliary ductal
dilation or pericystic fluid collection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pancreatitis - Following admission to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient required modest
volume resuscitation as she was briefly hemoconcentrated.  On
hospital day #3 her amylase and lipase dropped precipitously
consistent with her previous presentation of transient
pancreatitis.  Since stones had not been identified in her
gallbladder it was suspected that her pancreatitis was due to
medications or other nonstone causes.  In reviewing her
medication list, it was decided to ultimately withhold her
Atorvastatin as her cholesterol panel was well within the
normal range and this is a medication known to cause
pancreatitis, however, Ursodeoxycholic, a medication not
listed above, in her outpatient medication that she was
discharged with on her last presentation and this medication
may have to be withheld in the future as may Furosemide.

2.  Gastrointestinal bleeding - Serial evaluations of her
hemoglobin and hematocrit showed a stable vascular supply.
She received Proton pump inhibitor and it was decided to
withhold Clopidogrel indefinitely owing to her
gastrointestinal bleeding.
