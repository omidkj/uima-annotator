Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 31738**] underwent a right laparoscopic colectomy [**2145-10-29**]
without complications.  Subsequently she developed atrial
flutter with rapid ventricular response and was transferred to
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.
.
# Adenoma w/ atypia
Patient underwent right laproscopic ileocolectomy for adenoma
that was not amenable to resection via colonoscopy.  She
tolerated the procedure well.  Post-operatively she developed an
ileus however soon thereafter she tolerated clear and then full
diet.  Her bowel function also normalized as well.
.
# Atrial fibrillation / Flutter
Patient has known hx of aflutter / fibrillation.  She underwent
right sided aflutter ablation in [**2138**].  On post-op day 5 she
entered what was considered left sided atrial flutter with RVR
to 120-140s.  EP was consulted and her HR was controlled
initially w/ IV nodal agents.  She was subseqeuntly transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for afib/flutter management.  She was
treated with amiodarone, digoxin and metoprolol, and finaly
underwent successfull electrical cardioversion .
.
# Troponin Elevation
In the setting of aflutter w/ RVR her CE's were checked.
Troponin reached peak 0.17 despite flat CKs.  In the setting of
somewhat decreased GFR, the trop elevation was considered
secondary to demand ischemia.  She was chest pain free during
the episodes and EKG showed aflutter w/o ekg changes.
.
# Hypothyroidism
Home dose levothyroxine was continued.
.
# COPD
Patient experienced baseline SOB, worse w/ ambulation.  She has
known hx of COPD, w/ worsened PFT's most recently in [**Month (only) 216**]
[**2144**].  Inhalers were initially deferred, especially given lack
of bronchodilation on PFTs.  She was counseled to follow up w/
her pulmonologist.
.
# Anemia: most likely anemia of chronic disease, no source of
bleed, and HCT stable with normal B12/folate and iron.
