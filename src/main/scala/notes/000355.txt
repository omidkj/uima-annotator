CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old
woman with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes,
requiring hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday who
recently had an admission to [**Hospital6 2018**] from [**2144-3-21**] to [**2144-4-20**] after
experiencing a mechanical fall.  At that time she was
diagnosed with a left intertrochanteric femur fracture.  She
had a left open reduction and internal fixation with a screw
placed on [**4-2**].  Her hospital course was complicated by a
right femoral vein thrombosis with initiation of Coumadin,
with a repeat ultrasound to be performed in six weeks.  She
also had rapid atrial fibrillation requiring intravenous
Diltiazem, line infection and bacteremia with Methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus bacteremia; and UTI with Proteus bacteremia and
sepsis.  The patient was treated with multiple antibiotics and
was transferred to rehabilitation at the end of [**2144-3-28**],
to receive continued treatment for end stage renal disease,
anticoagulation for DVT and atrial fibrillation,  and for
consideration of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
due to decreased p.o. intake secondary to delirium.

On [**5-5**], the patient returned to the [**Hospital6 649**] for decreased blood pressure into the 80s
persistently, preventing hemodialysis.  The patient's code status
was recently changed from full to Do-Not-Resuscitate/Do-Not-
Intubate by the family.  The patient, prior to admission, had
experienced increased white blood cell count, hypoxia and
hypotension on [**4-29**], and was taken to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital where
she was diagnosed with urosepsis versus aspiration pneumonia and
stated on Gentamicin and Linezolid.  She had an increased
gentamicin level and the gentamicin and Linezolid were held as of
[**5-4**], but her blood pressure continued to be low.  Upon
transfer to [**Hospital6 256**] her pressure was
57/45.  She was given a 500 cc bolus and started on pressors
and transferred to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit for
further evaluation of her hemodynamic instability.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in an [**Hospital3 **]
facility, her doctor is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 9006**].  Her family spokesperson is
her daughter [**Name (NI) **], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 16861**]12, ? Her
home #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 16784**], cellular telephone #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 16785**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation the patient's vital
signs after 500 cc bolus of normal saline and starting on
Neo-Synephrine were 120/70, heartrate 120 and irregular,
respiratory rate 16, and sating 96% on 2 liters.  Physical
examination was notable for the following findings, dry
mucous membranes, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops, coarse breathsounds bilaterally in
the lungs with scattered rhonchi.  She had 1 to 2+ pitting
edema bilaterally and multipodus boots on.  Her mental status
was confused and unresponsive.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient on admission had a white blood
cell count of 10.7, 86% neutrophils, 0% bands.  Her
hematocrit was 29.5, platelets 339, her INR on admission was
8.3 with a PTT of 61.6 and PT 35.5.  Her chem-7 was sodium
137, potassium 4.6, chloride 105, bicarbonate notable for 13.
Her BUN was 37, creatinine 4.6.  Her chest x-ray showed no
infiltrate or overt failure on admission and
electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of
120, left axis deviation and 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depression in V2
through V4 unchanged from [**2144-4-4**].  Subsequently the
patient had negative blood cultures times two.  She had no
urine cultures as she is anuric.  Chest x-ray later on
demonstrated worsening left retrocardiac opacity / consolidation
/ collapse, suspicious for possible infection.  Her hematocrit
remained stable between 27 and 30. Her INR had decreased to 1.0.
Two days prior to admission, she was started on her Coumadin and
her INR was 1.2 on the day of discharge.  The patient, under
fluoroscopic guidance, had jejunostomy tube placed which showed
pigtail catheter to be in good condition.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - As previously
mentioned, the patient came in significantly hypotensive.
The etiology was deemed likely secondary to hypovolemia from
decreased p.o. intake with a questionable history of
diarrhea.  She was given 500 cc bolus and started on
pressors.  She had a good response to the pressors and a
normal saline bolus.  Her blood pressure came back up to
systolic/100.  During the remainder of her hospital stay her
pressure generally remained over 100 systolic on the floor
with occasional drops into the 90s.  However, while at
dialysis the patient's pressure tended to drop into the 80s.
The etiology of her hypertension as previously mentioned was
likely hypovolemia as all the cultures were negative and she
did not appear to have impaired cardiac function.  The
hypotension was not rate-related either.  She was quickly
weaned off of her pressors in the Intensive Care Unit within
two days and then transferred to the floor with further
management.  With regard to the patient's atrial fibrillation
she remained atrially fibrillated throughout the remainder of
her hospital stay with ventricular rate as high as 130 but
generally in 80 to 100 range and for the 24 hours prior to
discharge she remained in the 80s, on 60 mg of Diltiazem p.o.
q.i.d.

2.  Hematology - The patient came in with a highly elevated
INR Of greater than 8.  She has a history of a rig
