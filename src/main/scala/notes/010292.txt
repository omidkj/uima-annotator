CXR: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including
left ventricular enlargement. The known right upper lobe
paraspinal mass is just partially seen based on the chest
radiograph. The rest of the lungs are clear. No findings to
explain patient's hypertension are demonstrated.

EGD:
Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with
esophagitis
Retained fluids in stomach
Medium hiatal hernia
Previous Billroth I of the stomach
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Erythema and granularity in the stomach body compatible with
gastritis
Blood was seen in the pharynx and pooling in the piriform sinus
with associated clot. Attempt at suctioning the clot was made,
but not entirely successful. Attempt at slow withdrawal of scope
from the pharyngeal area was made and did not reveal any obvious
\lesions, but this was not an optimal examination of the pharynx
due to patient agitation towards the end of the procedure.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yoM on supratherapeutic on coumadin for AFib, recent
epistaxis with packing, who presents with hypotension and
melena.
.
# BLEEDING: Resolved hct stable. Given results of EGD likely
epistaxis was the source of the bleed. Etiology likely secontary
to supratherapeutic INR. Now status post Vit K and FFP.  Hct
remained stable and there was no more evidence of bleeding.  ENT
was not involved as likely seconday to supratherapeutic INR and
resolved.
.
# HYPOTENSION: Resolved. Related to blood loss and stable now
that volume rescusitated.
.
# ALTERED MS: non-focal neuro exam; has dementia.  Seems to be
at his baseline for mental status.  Restarted home medications
aside from Depakote as unclear why the patient was on it.
Patient was stable, clearly demented but pleasant and
cooperative.
.
# AFIB: Currently in one teens. Occasionally bumping into 130s.
Having multiple episodes on floor of spiking into 150s.  Stopped
coumadin given severity of bleed.  Would recommend not
restarting it given age and risk of rebleed.  Patient had a
difficult to control heart rate while on the medical floor.
Eventually he was stabalized on 37.5mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and
75mg of diltiazem QID.  These could not be given as extended
release forms because the patient would chew all of his meds.
The diltiazem and the metoprolol should not be given at the same
time as he would occasionally have a heart rate down to the 50s.

.
# HTN: Stopped amlodipine.  Increased mateprolol for A-fib and
started diltiazem for A-fib as well.
.
# FEN: Regular diet.
.
# PPX: boots, PPI PO.
