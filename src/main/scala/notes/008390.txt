Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4393**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R hickman removal
L tunneled line placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47598**] is a 50-year-old female with a complicated past
medical
history including AMA-positive primary biliary cirrhosis with at

least stage 3 fibrosis (LBX [**5-/2164**]), which has been complicated
by portal pulmonary hypertension on Treprostinil gtt,
non-bleeding esophageal varices, and ascites who is presenting
with severe abdominal pain.

She developed chills and subjective fevers yesterday, shortly
afterwards she noted insidious onset of diffuse abdominal pain.
She developed diarrhea, small volume and mucousy discharge [**4-1**]
times overnight accompanied by nausea but not vomiting. She has
been excessively fatigued. No recent sick contacts. The pain
progressed over the daytime today- it is exacerbated by movement
and relents somewhat when still. She noted severe pain during
the drive to the hospital when the car hit roadbumps. She has
had very poor appetite with decreased PO over the past day. She
has held her diuretics. She has no history of SBP per her
report.

With regard to her liver disease, she has has had
diuretic-controlled ascites, and she is currently taking
spironolactone 100 mg daily (along with potassium
supplementation given history of low K.) Her last upper
endoscopy [**2172-4-3**] noted two cords of grade [**11-23**] varices. She is
on nadolol 10 mg daily. She has never had bleeding esophageal
varices. Her last abdominal U/S [**2173-4-21**] was negative for liver
mass lesions. Her main complications has been portal pulmonary
hypertension, which has been severe. She was hospitalized
[**Date range (1) 47599**] @ [**Hospital1 18**] for placement of a central caheter and
initiation of treprostinil therapy. She is on a dose escalation
schedule and is currently at 106.5. Her repeat right heart cath
[**2173-5-19**] noted PASP 45 mmHg (previously 52 mmHg.)

In the ED, initial vs were 100.0F, 93, 95/62, 18. Exam was
significant for exquisite abdominal pain diffusely to palpation.
CT abd/pelvis showed ?peritonitis, ascites, cirrhosis, and a
normal gallbladder. Discussions with liver team raised
possibility of SBP, though a paracentesis could not be performed
due to an inability to find an accessible pocket. She was given
2g ceftriaxone and was admitted.

On arrival to the floor, VS were T99.4 BP93/47 P105 RR18
Sat95RA. She is in pain but feels better while laying still. In
discussion with pharmacy given the plans for dose escalation of
Treprostinil and the need for frequent vital sign checks, she
was transferred to the MICU for close monitoring.

On arrival to the MICU, she stated that abdominal pain continued
and was improved if she remained still.

CT Abd/pelvis [**2173-7-16**]:
1.  Subtle enhancement of the peritoneal surfaces, raising
concern for
peritonitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
2.  Cirrhosis, with recanalization of the umbilical vein and
numerous varices
with ascites consistent with portal hypertension.
3.  Unremarkable gallbladder, with note again made of a stone
adjacent to the
gallbladder wall.

RUQ U/S [**2173-7-17**]:
1.  Patent portal vein.
2.  Evidence of cirrhosis and small volume ascites.
3.  Mild circumferential gallbladder wall thickening, likely
secondary to
third spacing.
4.  Massive splenomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47598**] is a 50yoF with primary biliary cirrhosis (c/b
portal pulmonary hypertension, ascites and esophageal varices)
who presented with diffuse abdominal pain.

# SBP: Exam initially showing rebound and significant
tenderness, thought to be SBP given her history of cirrhosis and
ascites. There was no evidence of secondary peritonitis seen on
CT abdomen. Lipase was normal. Gall bladder stone is seen on CT,
which could potentially explain RUQ pain but not the diffuse
abdominal pain picture. Tbili decreased, as was Alk phos. All
LFTs decreased but Tbili started to uptrend. No ascites fluid
pocket was seen on U/S, so she was treated empirically with
ceftriaxone and albumin 1.5mg/kg. Fluid resuscitation. Portal
Vein patent. Drug rash [**7-19**] with Ceftriaxone, so switched to
therapeutic PO Cipro. Started cipro ppx [**7-21**]. S/p albumin,
received on days 1 and 3. Restarted diuretics and uptitrated
spironolactone back to home dose of 50 [**Hospital1 **]. Pt slightly volume
up from MICU stay, so init
