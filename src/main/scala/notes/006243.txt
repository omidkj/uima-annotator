Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with balloon angioplasty of the left
main coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
67M with CAD s/p CABG [**2169**], PCI [**10-1**] with DES to LMCA (required
IABP), COPD, lung ca s/p resection, h/o VT s/p ICD, HL, DM, AF
with PPM in place who presented today for elective c. cath after
experiencing worsening CHF symptoms at home. Pt has severe
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25% from [**10-1**] echo. After
his [**10-1**] cath his symptoms of dysnpea improved until
approximately 6 weeks to 1 month ago. He noted increasing DOE,
now becoming winded walking to mailbox. Has to sleep sitting up.
Notes he has gained 10lbs in the past week with increasing LE
edema. No CP, no palpitations. Presented to cardiologist 4 days
prior to admission, who increased his spironolactone and
arranged for elective cath at [**Hospital1 18**] today. In cath lab this
evening pt was hypotensive peri-cath requiring dopamine. He was
noted to have eccentric restenosis of his LMCA --> LCx stent
which was dilated to 4.0 with ballon angioplasty. His LIMA to
LAD graft remained patent. He was admitted to the CCU for
monitoring in the setting of his persistent pressor requirement.

.
Upon arrival to the floor the patient's BPs were in the 80s on
low dose dopamine. He complained of a [**3-5**] headache, otherwise
had no other complaints. Denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, groin pain. Was able to lay flat in the
bed comfortably. No lightheadedness. He was pleasant, alert and
oriented. His wife and daughter were with him and corroborated
that he had taken all of his medications that morning.

***IMAGING***
[**2182-3-9**] CXR
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2182-1-16**].

Pacemaker and median sternotomy wires are unchanged. There
remains an
enlarged cardiac silhouette. There is again seen some deformity
of the right upper rib cage which is stable. Scarring is seen
within the right apex. There is no signs of overt pulmonary
edema. There is likely small bilateral pleural effusions however
these are unchanged since the previous study.

Brief Hospital Course:
67M with CAD and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy presented for
cardiac cath in the setting of worsening CHF symtoms with
balloon dilation of LMCA stent, admitted to CCU for monitoring
of his hypotension requiring pressors.
.
# PUMP: Chronic systolic heart failure, EF 25% in [**10-1**]. Has ICD
in place. Hypotensive to 70s in cath lab requiring dopamine.
Upon arrival to the CCU patient with persistent low dose
requirement. Per outpatient cardiologist and patient he
tolerates SBPs in 80s with minimal orthostasis.  Pt seems to be
in class III NYHA heart failure at home, with worsening at home
lately resulting in this presentation.  Patient was weaned off
of pressors.  Initially held ACE inhibitor in the setting of
hypotension was restarted once pressures stabilized. Patient was
continued on outpatient digoxin. Patient continued on aspirin
and statin.  Patient was discharged on ACE inhibitor at
outpatient dose.  Atenolol was lowered given low blood pressure.

.
# CORONARIES:  Known CAD, with occluded vein grafts, RCA.
Patent LIMA to LAD.  LMCA to Cx ballooned on admission.  Pt's
worsening symptoms potentially in setting of in-stent stenosis.
Patient was continued on ASA.  Patient will require plavix for
at least one year, ideally indefinitely.  Patient was continued
on statin.  Initially held  ACEI and BB tonight in the setting
of hypotension. Discussed medications for discharge with
outpatient cardiologist and decided to discharge patient on
decreased dose of atenolol given baseline hypotension.
.
# RHYTHM:  Pt has history of VT (without ICD shocks) and AF, has
ICD/PPM in place, currently a-paced at 75.  Patient is
maintained as outaptient on quinidine which was continued
through admission and on discharge.  Initially beta blocker held
in the setting of hypotension restarted on discharge.  Patient
is not on anti-coagulation as an outpatient even with history of
atrial fibrillation and low ejection fraction.  Defer to
outpatient cardiologist for this management.  Patient was
dischaged on beta blocker, quinidine.
.
# COPD: On home 02, per report has fairly severe disease, and
has a history of RUL lobectomy for lung ca.  On admission
patient had wheezing.  Patient was continued on home formeterol,
Fluticasone and given nebs of ipratropium, albuterol.  Patient
not on long acting anti-cholinergic as outpatient, would
consider outpatient addition of long acting anti-cholinergic.
Patient was continued on PRN albuterol and supplemental oxygen.
.
# Gout: Pt complaining of increased pain similar to his gout
pain in R foot. Normally takes Indomethacin at home, but holding
in setting of recent cath. Patient was given Tylenol as needed
to improve pain, but pain persistented. Discussed case with
rheumatology who suggested colchicine and prednisone for a few
days and to avoid indomethacine gi
