Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for pacemaker removal.

This is a 70 yo man c hx of T2 DM, CAD, bovine AVR,  ischemic
cardiomyopathy EF 30-35% .Pt had AICD placed in [**2176-11-14**].
Admitted on [**1-20**] for AICD  pocket infection. AICD was
removed and placed on the opposite side. He received 4 weeks of
Vancomycin through PICC line.
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 34**] [**2177-5-28**] with 2 week history of fever and
chills. He had an elevated WBC of [**Numeric Identifier 5863**]. Blood cultures  [**1-16**] had
Coag (-) Staph pan sensitive. TEE  ECHO done [**6-3**] showed
thickening of tricuspid valve ,  no  clear  vagetations. There
is question of vegetations in the AICD leads.EF was  40%.
Pt  has been seen by ID specialists who recommended Oxacillin,
Rifampin and Gentamycin. He is on day  # 6
Pt's blood culture form [**5-30**] and [**5-31**] have been negative and
patient has remained afebrile since starting atb therapy.
Pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for removal of AICD and pacemaker leads
in the OR.

A/P
70 to man c ischemic CM, CHF EF 30% , S/P  AICD/ pacemaker
insertion 6 months ago presents c new MSSA bacteremia

# MSSA bacteremia: Most likely secondary to AICD-pacemaker
pocket infection. TEE no  c signs of IE. However there was some
concern of possible vegetations on AICD leads. Discussed case c
EP fellow if this is the case , removal of AICD would need to be
in the OR and patient  will need temporary pacemaker prior to
that.
-Continue Oxacillin, Gent and Rifampin.
-Obtain reports from  [**Hospital1 34**] of TEE to evaluate for possible PFO
and vegetations in the AICD leads.
-Gent levels peak and trough levels.
-Discuss c EP in am
-low threshold for MRI of spine considering back pain.
-surveillance   blood cultures.
-ID evaluation.

# AV block : Temporary pacemaker in OR  during removal of AICD
-pacemaker.

#Renal Failure: Pt has renal failure . No previous creatinine
values available.
-Will give single daily  dose of  for 24 h.

# CAD: Pt c severe CAD and ischemic CM
-Continue ASA, BBlock and statins.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**6-6**], taken to the OR for removal of infected pacer leads,
placement of epicardial leads, and permanent pacemaker.  See op
note for details.  Post-op, he had elevated LFT's, worsening
acidosis, elev. WBC.  General surgery consulted, and yook him to
the OR on [**6-7**] for diagnostic laparoscopy which was negative.
Neurology service was consulted for decreased level of
wakefulness.  CT scan was negative for any acute infarct.  He
continued with low cardiac output, acidosis, pressor and
inotrope requirement, and had a TEE on [**6-8**].  This showed
pericardial fluid collection with signs of RV copmpression.  He
had evacuation of pericardial tamponade/washout at the bedside
on [**2177-6-9**].
Over the next few days, he improved hemodynamically, drips were
eventually weaned off.  His mental status also improved
significantly as well.  He was extubated on [**6-11**], and stable
from cardiac and respiratory standpoints.  He did, however, have
rising creatinine which the renal service attributed to ATN.  He
remained non-oliguric, his creatinine peaked at 6.5, but has
steadily decreased throught the remainder of his stay.
On [**7-13**], he was again noted to have elevarted LFT's,
acidosis, and decreased cardiac output.  He underwent evacuaiton
of pericardial tamponade on [**2177-6-16**].
He has continued to make steady pregress in all areas, had
remained hemodynamically stable, and is now ready to be
discharged to rehab for continued physical therapy to increase
mobility.
