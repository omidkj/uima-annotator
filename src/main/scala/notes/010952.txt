Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
79M w/ hx Hep B & C, metastatic HCC, mets to brain, who
presented with lethargy, decreased PO intake from [**Hospital1 1501**] to [**Hospital1 498**]
on [**7-17**], transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**7-18**]. Patient code status had been
CMO at [**Hospital1 1501**], was noted to be increasingly unresponsive, had
increased abdominal girth, and hypoglycemic for 1-2 days. At
baseline, he needs significant aid with ADLs, however could
still follow simple instructions and interact with caregivers.
[**Name (NI) **] was evaluated initially at [**Hospital1 498**], where his family revoked
CMO status. He received a paracentesis draining 500cc straw
colored/blood tinged fluid (sent for G stain, cx, CBC, alb,
protein). His family then requested that for the patient to be
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were: T 99.9 HR 120 BP 118/82 RR 18 O2 99%
4L NC. He was found to be moderately agitated, and was given
lorazepam 1mg. Labs were significant for FS 60s, Na 155, ALT
218, AST 413, AP 180, lactate 2.9. CXR: RML pneumonia, small
lung volumes. The OSH infiltrated IV line was discontinued, and
he was given D50% and drip through a new IV line. He also
received morphine 5mg, vancomcin 1g, cefepime 3g, and flagyl
500mg.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: T 97.7, HR 110s, BP
100-150s/67-80, RR 15, O2 97% / 2L


Past Medical History:
1.  Hepatitis B.
2.  Hepatitis C.
3.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (left lobe involving vasculature),
advanced.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  GERD.
6.  Subarachnoid hemorrhage.


Social History:
married, a former police officer and sergeant. 13 children

Family History:
No known family history of liver disease or hepatocellular
carcinoma.


Physical Exam:
cachectic, elderly black gentleman. Neither oriented nor
attentive. Does not follow commands, mildly agitated with
movement.
HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, pupils 3 to 2mm, oropharynx dry but
clear, EOMI, PERRL
Neck: supple, JVP 7-8cm but difficult to appreciate given
bounding carotid pulse, no LAD
CV: Regular, tachycardic, S1 + S2, 3/6 systolic murmur, no rubs
/ gallops
Lungs: rales at R middle lobe region, clear otherwise
bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi
Abdomen: tensely distended, clear dressing on left lower
quadrant, bowel sounds present, no grimace to palpation,
organomegaly difficult to appreciate given dissension.
GU: foley draining dark yellow urine
Ext: 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the knee, warm, 2+ pulses,
no clubbing, cyanosis
Neuro: Does not follow commands, CNII-XII grossly intact, moves
all four extremities, brisk reflexes 2+ throughout in upper and
lower extremities, clonus in R foot, none in left.


Pertinent Results:
[**2112-7-18**] WBC-10.9 RBC-4.37* HGB-12.1* HCT-37.6* MCV-86 MCH-27.7
MCHC-32.1 RDW-18.8*

[**7-18**] CXR IMPRESSION:  Patchy but extensive new right lung
opacity worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration.  Although
probably an artifact, repeat radiographs are recommended to
exclude the unlikely possibility of free air associated with a
curvilinear lucency projecting along the right lower hemithorax.


MRI Brain w/ contrast ([**Hospital1 **] [**2112-7-13**]):
1. R post temporal lobe significantly increased hyper intensity
on FLAIR concerning for met.
2. Superimposed resolving SAH in same region
3. Scattered white matter changes c/w microangiopathic disease

EKG: 1mm ST depressions in antero-lateral leads, otherwise
normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo M h/o Hep B & C, metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma,
subarachnoid hemorrhage who presents with lethargy and
hypoglycemia from nursing home and [**Hospital **] transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for prominent hypernatremia and higher nursing level care

ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#Altered Mental Status:  Thought to be multifactorial including
electrolyte abnormalities, infection (RML pneumonia), and HCC
metastastic disease to the R post temporal lobe.  His electrolye
abnormalities were corrected as below.  His pneumonia was
treated as below with no improvements of his altered mental
status.  A family meeting was held and included patient's
priest, family, palliative care, and the ICU team where his
goals of care were addressed.  Following extensive discussion of
medical condition, poor prognosis and poor progress, decision
was made to focus care on comfort as priority (consistent with
patients previously expressed wishes).
.
# HYPERNATREMIA: Now corrected, with no real change in mental
status; was likely hypovolemic hypernatremia secondary to
dehydration with Na 155 at admission.  His free water deficit
was corrected, but no change in his altered mental status.
.
# RML PNEUMONIA: CXR was concerning for PNA, elevated WBC, and
productive cough were concerning for nursing-home acquired
pneumonia. He was on vancomycin/cefepime, which was continued
until the family decided to make him comfort measures only.
.
# HYPOGLYCEMIA: likely due to impaired gluconeogenesis and
increased tumor burden from his HCC.  He was treated with
continuous D12.5 infusion and prn iv boluses of D50W.  Once his
hypoglycemia was corrected, his mental status did not improved.
These measures were continued until his family decided to make
him comfort measures only.
.
# HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA: he has locally advanced neoplasm
contributing to his abdominal girth, radiating back pain, and
profound bilateral edema. It may also have a local mass effect
with the stomach and lead to early satiety and postprandial
discomfort. Per GI note [**2112-7-1**], palliative management may be
best. Sorafenib may increase the risk of recurrent ICH, and
local CyberKnife has limited value. Surgical resection,
radiofrequency ablation, chemoembolization and liver transplants
are not being considered. The patient was previously CMO at his
nursing care facility, however his family reversed his status.
Per GI note in [**Month (only) **]/[**2112-7-3**], palliative management may be best
given the extent of his HCC.  While hospitalized, radiation
oncology recommended no intervention.  Hem/onc and palliative
care were consulted and his goals of care were changed to CMO.

Patient quietly and peacefully expired on [**2112-7-23**].

INACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
# GERD: stable. continue with nexium 40mg [**Hospital1 **] at home

# BPH: stable, continue home medications of doxazosin 1mg daily,
and oxybutynin 100mg daily.
