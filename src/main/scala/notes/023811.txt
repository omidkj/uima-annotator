Chief Complaint:
Hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68759**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of chronic
hyponatremia attributed to SIADH, chronic bronchitis, moderate
aortic stenosis, htn who presents to the ED with complaints of
increased SOB.

Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 68760**]/08 with epigastric
pain and atypical chest pain. He was ruled out for MI and
treated for GERD with PPI and Maalox and was scheduled for an
outpatient breath test for H pylori and close follow up with his
GI MD, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 452**]. He was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] rehab. He was also
admitted in [**10/2200**] for hyponatremia in the setting of pna. At
that time he was treated with levofloxacin and 1500 cc fluid
restriction with improvement in Na back to his baseline.

Current history obtained with the aid of an interpreter and
through discussions with patient's son. On [**12-7**], patient fell
in the kitchen of his apartment. The fall seems to have been
mechanical without LOC seizure symptoms, CP, SOB, or dizziness.
At baseline he has B UE pain due to rotator cuff injuries.
However, after the fall, he had worse B UE pain. He was brought
to [**Hospital3 **] where he had X-rays which were negative for
fracture. He was then discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab as son reported
significant decline in his level of independent function
including multiple falls over the last several months. It seems
he was discharged on a 1500 cc fluid restriction with
instructions to repeat Na in 1 week. Today, at rehab, patient
had routine labs drawn and were remarkable for Na 122. Per
report, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
of hyponatremia.

In the ED, 96.0, 153/102, 64, 16, 98% RA. Patient interviewed
with aid of Russian interpreter. Mental status was felt to be at
most recent baseline. No seizures or other Neurologic changes
noted. Patient was without complaint with the exception of some
increased SOB and increased albuterol requirements. Labs
remarkable for Hct of 28 at most recent baseline, WBC of 10
without left shift, Na 116 (from BL of 125-131), BUN/Cr 17/0.8.
CXR was without significant abnormality.

On arrival to ICU, patient reports several days of icreased SOB.
He notes epigastric pain but denies any chest pressure. No
orthopnea or PND. No fevers or chills. 1 day of cough,
nonproductive. He notes significant B UE pain, including pain in
whole R arm, L arm from elbow to hand, and L thumb pain. He
denies any increased thirst or change in his regular po intake.

Studies:

ECG [**12-12**]: NSR @ 58. Nl axis and intervals. TWF in III. Compared
to prior, no sig change.

CXR [**12-12**]:
The lungs are well expanded. There is minimal atelectasis in the
retrocardiac left lung base; however, no consolidation or edema
is evident. There is minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
The cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged with a left
ventricular configuration. No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Left base atelectasis, with no definite acute
pulmonary process.

Head CT [**12-12**]:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The ventricles and sulci are
slightly prominent, consistent with age-related involutional
changes. Punctate focus of mineralization is noted within the
left basal ganglia. The carotid siphons are heavily calcified.
Paranasal sinus disease has progressed from prior exam, with
moderate opacification of the ethmoidal air cells, sphenoid and
maxillary sinuses and fluid within the left mastoid air cells.
There is no calvarial fracture or soft tissue abnormality.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or calvarial fracture.
2. Progressed sinus disease, now moderate in extent.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68759**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of chronic
hyponatremia attributed to SIADH, chronic bronchitis, moderate
aortic stenosis, htn admitted for hyponatremia.

# Hyponatremia: The patient has a history of chronic
hyponatremia secondary to SIADH. His baseline ranges from
125-130. On admission his Na was 116.  He did not appear to be
symptomatic.  He was placed on a 1.5 L water restriction and
started on salt tabs and his Na rose slowly.  By discharge his
Na had increased to 129. TSH and cortisol WNL. His CT head and
chest X-ray were unrevealing. He appeared euvolemic.  He had a
fall within the last month so pain may have triggered his
hyponatremia by increasing his ADH.  His pain was controlled
with standing tylenol and tramadol prn as below.  He was
discharged with a continued fluid restriction of 1500 cc/day,
salt tabs 2 gm po TID.

# SOB: The patient has a history of chronic bronchitis and had
subjective SOB on admission to the ICU. During his hospital
admission he was sating well on room air.  He remained afebrile
and his CXR was clear.  He was continued on fluticasone inhal
[**Hospital1 **] and given albuterol and atrovent nebs prn.

# Bilateral UE pain: The patient had a recent fall and was
admitted from rehab. He has known rotator cuff injuries. No
fractures by report from survey performed at [**Hospital3 **] after fall the fall.  His pain was controlled with
Tylenol 1 gm TID standing, ultram prn, and lidocaine patches.

# HTN: The patient was initally continued on his outpatient
regimen of metoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate, and valsartan.
His SBP were noted to be persistent elevated so his valsartan
was increased from 100 mg daily to 160 mg daily.

# Chronic diastolic CHF: The patient remained euvolemic during
his hospitalization.  He was continued on valsartan and
metoprolol.

# ? CAD: The paatient carries a history of CAD for unclear
reasons as he has never had a positive stress test nor cardiac
catheterization, has no WMA on ECHO and has no QWs on ECG.  He
was continued on his outpatient medications including plavix, a
statin, beta-blocker, and imdur.
