[**2148-5-2**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe pulmonary hypertension and elevated filling pressures,
which
improved by the end of the case.
3. Successful stenting of the mid LAD with two overlapping Drug
Eluting
Stents.

[**2148-5-3**] ECHO
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately
dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
an apical left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2147-6-27**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.

[**2148-5-4**] Abdominal Ultrasound
1. Diffusely heterogeneous and coarsened echotexture to the
liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Likely areas of focal
fatty sparing, however a short term follow-up study (approx 3
months) is recommended to exclude space occupying lesions. If
there is clincal concern, further work-up with MRI may be
performed.
2. Splenomegaly.
3. Ectatic aorta, although no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.


[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
on [**2148-5-2**] for a cardiac catheterization  and surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. The cardiac
catheterization was significant for severe left main disease, a
95% stenosed left anterior descending artery, a moderately
disease circumflex artery and severe mitral valve regurgitation.
Stenting was performed to the left anterior descending artery
with improvement in his hemodynamics. Milrinone was started for
a low cardiac index however as this caused tachycardia
vasopressin was used with good effect. an Echocardiogram was
obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 25%, an apical
left ventricular aneurysm, 3+ mitral regurgitation and a
moderately dilated left ventricular cavity. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner by the cardiac
surgery service. A prophylactic intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed prior to surgery given his low ejection fraction. As Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was in atrial flutter, he was cardioverted on [**2148-5-4**]
under transesophageal guidance back into normal sinus rhythm. On
[**2148-5-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to one vessel and a
mitral valve repair utilizing a 28mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Known firstname **] ring.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 26228**] neurologically intact and was extubated. He was transfused
for postoperative anemia. His intra-aortic balloon pump was
weaned and removed without complication. He again developed
rapid atrial fibrillation which was rate controlled with beta
blockade. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation. On
postoperative day three, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred  to the
cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His drains and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. Heparin was started for
anticoagulation until his [**Known lastname 263**] was within therapeutic range.
Plavix was continued given his recent coronary stents. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] developed some slight sternal serous drainage from the
inferior aspect of his sternotomy. Betadine occlusive dressings
were applied and vancomycin as well as levofloxacin were started
prophylactically. Cultures of his sternal wound were negative
and the vancomycin was discontinued. Beta blockade was adjusted
for appropriate rate control of his atrial fibrillation. His
medications were adjusted due to Mr. [**Known lastname 5024**] financial
concerns. Slowly his sternal drainage slowed and ceased. On
postoperative day fifteen, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was discharged home with a
visiting nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 263**] on discharge was 2.0. Mr. [**Known lastname **] will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient.
