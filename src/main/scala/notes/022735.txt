Service:  UROLOGY

OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES:  Cystoscopy, right ureteral stent,
retrograde pyelogram, right extracorporeal shock wave
lithotripsy.

MEDICAL SUMMARY:  A 35 year-old female who presents with
right renal stones for shock wave lithotripsy. The risks,
benefits, potential complications of the procedure were
reviewed with the patient.  Informed consent was obtained.
The patient was known to have several stones in the right
kidney and had progressive and persistent discomfort in that
area.

Patient was brought to the cystoscopy [****].  She
underwent cystoscopy and right retrograde which showed an
extrarenal pelvis with a tight ureteropelvic junction. The
catheter was left indwelling and she was brought to the
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy suite.  She underwent
shock wave lithotripsy uneventfully.  The stent was removed
and she was then brought to the recovery room.  Over the
course of the next several hours she had progressive
discomfort in the right kidney which required a large amount
of analgesics.  For this reason the decision was made to
bring her back to the cystoscopy suite and put in an internal
stent.  This was performed uneventfully.  Thereafter the
patient had some respiratory compromise thought to be
secondary to the large amount of analgesics that she had
received.  For this reason she was brought to the Intensive
Care Unit for careful monitoring.  Over the ensuing days she
was diuresed.  Her CT scan was performed which did show some
hilar adenopathy for which the patient was told to seek
follow up with her internist.  Her internist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9006**], was
informed of these findings and follow up was arranged for the
patient.  The patient was discharged on [**2113-7-16**].  Follow up
was to be performed in the very near future to determine the
overall efficacy of the disintegration and removal of stent.
