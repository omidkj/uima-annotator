Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, w/ placement of 6 stents to the LAD
Intra-aortic Balloon Pump
Internal Jugular Central Venous Catheter placement, with
Swan-Ganz
     catheter insertion

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 78 yo woman with h/o breast CA presented with sudden onset
of [**10-18**] chest pressure radiating to back while sitting up in
chair.  + associated dyspnea, nausea, emesis x 1, This started
at 5:30 pm.  After about 4 hours of persistent pain, EMS was
called.  Found to have STE in anterior leads on EKG en route to
hospital and given 4 baby aspirin.  In ED, repeat EKG still with
anterior STEMI.  Also had intermittent RBBB and NSVT in ED.
Started on heparin, nitro and integrillin gtt, loaded with 300
mg plaix, given lopressor 5 mg IV x 3, and brought urgently to
cath lab.  About 20-30 minutes into procedure, patient rapidly
developed pulmonary edema and was intubated for respiratory
distress.  Bloody, frothy fluid suctioned from ET tube.  Given
lasix 20 mg IV.  Also developed hypotension and dopamine
started.
.
The cath revealed 3VD, with multiple stenoses in LAD (thought to
be distal embolization from proximal plaque) with 6 bare metal
stents to LAD.  In addition, patient had chronic total occlusion
of RCA.  Right heart cath (on dopa) with RA 17, RV 46/12, PA
46/20 (35), PCWP 30, CO 3.15 L/min, CI 1.82 L/min/m2.  During
procedure patient developed small b/l groin hematomas, so
integrillin stopped and hematomas stable.  Patient brought to
CCU on dopamine gtt with balloon pump (1st attempted in L groin
but iliac artery thrombosed) and swan in place, both in R groin.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)STEMI: Mrs. [**Known lastname 28660**] was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] with a large anterior
STEMI and was taken to the cath lab for revascularization, and
received 6 stents to the LAD.  She was eventually started on
ASA, beta blocker, Plavix, and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] for [**Hospital 64052**] medical
management.

2)CHF: Mrs. [**Known lastname 28660**] was left with an EF of 20% after her MI.  Her
hospital course was complicated by cardiogenic shock and
pulmonary edema.  She required an IABP and pressor support for a
while but was eventually weaned off successfully.  She was
started on the cardiac medications listed above, as well as
Coumadin for apical akinesis.  She has had no evidence of
ongoing ischemia by EKG or enzymes.

3)VT: On admission, she had fascicular VT and the team was
concerned for possible development of CHB (as she had evidence
of septal ischemia and had a fascicular rhythm from R post
fascicle). This resolved w/ PCI. Then 2 days later she had
sustained VT originating from anterior apex and was IV loaded
with amiodarone.  She did not require defibrillation as she
remained hemodynamically stable. Per EP, this was still in
peri-MI period, and amiodarone use could possibly progress to
CHB so it was stopped. She has had no further recurrence of VT.

4) Respiratory distress - She initially had difficulty breathing
secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of MI and depressed
EF.  She was agressively diuresed using PA cath #s for guidance.
 She had daily episodes of desaturation while in the CCU, felt
to be due to bronchospasm. She had no obvious infiltrate on CXR.
She has a residual O2 requirement, and will need to go to rehab
with supplemental O2.

5) FEN - She was kept NPO while intubated, and then switched to
a heart healthy diet when she began taking po.  She has needed
potassium repletion frequently during this admission due to
aggressive diuresis with Lasix.  She appears euvolemic upon
discharge.

6) Schizophrenia- Mrs. [**Known lastname 28660**] stated to the team that she was
diagnosed with schizophrenia as a child and has been taking
Mellaril for over 25 years.  She has had no psychotic symptoms
during this admission.  She was restarted on her outpatient dose
of Mellaril during this admission.  She would benefit from
having psychiatry follow-up after discharge for reassessment of
diagnosis and medicine regimen.

7) Code status- The patient was full code throughout this
admission.

8) Dispo- Mrs. [**Known lastname 28660**] is being discharged to a temporary
rehabilitation facility for physical therapy and regain of
function.
