History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 53 year-old male with past suicide attempts who
presents with antidepressant overdose in an apparent suicide
attempt. He was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] by EMS ambulance after
being observed stumbling in the street. He reported that he
wanted to kill himself and had taken a whole bottle of his
diabetes medication and an entire bottle of his antidepressants,
but was unable to identify what he had ingested. On arrival, he
was hypotensive to the 80's, diaphoretic with altered mental
status.
In the ED, he received 2X Narcan with no effect; 2L NS with good
effect; and was intubated for airway protection given worsening
mental status, with BP rising transiently to the 160's.
Toxicology recommended checking the QRS, which was 102, with a
"normal" QTc and deferral of activated charcoal given inability
to identify the overdosed medications. Otherwise,  Cr was
elevated to 2.8, lactate to 5.4, ut mag, potassium remained wnl.
Psychiatry was consulted.
.
On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his SBP was in the 130's. He was
sedated on propofol and placed on A/C 400x 14 FiO2 1.0, peep 5.
No ABG was drawn in the ED on these settings. His access is an
EJ 18g on the right, 22 in hand.

.
ROS: unable to be obtained given that patient is intubated and
sedated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: This is a 53 year-old male with an extensive
psychiatric history with past suicide attempts who presents with
antidepressant overdose in an apparent suicide attempt.

SUICIDAL IDEATION / OVERDOSE -patient was initially admitted to
the ICU after intubation in the Emergency Department for airway
protection. His exact ingestion was unknown, toxicology was
consulted. He experienced no hemodynamic instability or other
signs or symptoms to suggest a specific toxidrome. He required
no specific treatment other than supportive care and
observation. He was quickly extubated and transferred to a
general medical floor where he was continued on 1:1 sitter as he
continued to be actively suicidal. He was seen by psychiatry and
continued inpatient care was recommended. He was behaviorly
stable and appropriate. Specific psychiatric medicines were held
and deferred to the inpatient psych setting.

2.DM II uncontrolled with complications -Pt may have ingested
metformin in his gesture, as evidenced by an initial lactic
acidosis on admission. His blood sugars remained stable and on
transfer to the floor his metformin was restarted. He should
continue his metformin since he will be in a monitored
environment with finger blood sugar checks with sliding scale
coverage at least twice a day. Further care of his diabetes will
be deferred to his outpatient providers.

3. SCHIZOAFFECTIVE/BIPOLAR/DEPRESSION -carries these diagnoses
prior to admit. last med list obtained included: Effexor,
Lamictal, Risperdal, and Trileptal. No specific recommendations
regarding these medications were made by the psychiatry consult
service and was deferred to his inpatient care team. He was
receiving only prn Haldol which he would request.

4. HYPOTHYROID -continued on last known replacement Synthroid
dose. TSH was within therapeutic levels.

5. HTN, BENIGN -lisinopril continued.
