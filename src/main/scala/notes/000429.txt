Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
1. Dyspnea
2. Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 46286**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo man with history of sCHF (EF 20-25%
[**4-/2135**]), complete heart block s/p pacer, AS s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
porcine valve, [**10-7**]), Afib s/p cardioversion on warfarin, HTN,
and GERD who presents with 1-2 week history of progressive
fatigue, weakness, and dyspnea on exertion, as well as new onset
hemoptysis in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
.
Patient was in his usual state of health until two weeks prior
to presentation when he developed slight DOE and increased lower
extremity edema, felt to be mild exacerbation of CHF by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] lasix dose was increased from 20mg daily to 40mg daily with
some effect. However, 1-2 weeks prior to presentation patient
reported increasing fatigue, weakness, and SOB.  He developed
dyspnea with only several steps around his apartment. He denied
dyspnea at rest, orthopnea or PND.  Denied any fever or chills,
but reported >1 week of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and a
terrible cough productive of white phlegm.  The morning of
presentation ([**2136-2-3**]) he noted bright red blood mixed in with
his phlegm; he could not fully quantify the amount though likely
less than 1 tsp at a time. Patient reported several episodes of
recurrent hemoptysis, prompting presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further evaluation.
.
In the emergency department, initial VS were T: 96.4 HR: 80 BP:
120/73 RR: 16 O2%: 100% on an unknown amount of oxygen. Exam was
notable for blood in oropharynx, crackles and decreased breath
sounds on right. Stool was guiac negative. Labs were notable for
INR of 6.8, WBC 11.8 with 87.0% N, HCT 39.1. Difficult to obtain
blood draws per ED report, and several samples hemolyzed. CXR
demostrated whiteout of right lung fields, as well as left sided
effusion. EKG showed AFib with intermittent pacing, no ischemic
changes. Bedside echo to exclude severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 3**] [**Last Name (Titles) 46296**] of
right-sided effusion was limited study, but showed only mild MR.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] ordered for vitamin K 10 units IV, 2 units FFP and
profilnine. Also received vanco 1gm IV, zosyn 4.5mg IV,
oseltamivir. Admitted to MICU for ongoing evaluation and
management. On arrival to ICU, patient had an O2 sat > 94 on
NRB, though became dyspneic with desats to 80s when NRB removed.
He reports no recent changes in medications (other than increase
in lasix dose), no sick contacts, no recent change in diet. Most
recent INR reported in our system was 1.9 on [**2135-12-21**] (per OMR
notes), and patient's goal INR has been 2-2.5.

IMAGING:
[**2136-2-3**] Echo: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
systolic function appears depressed. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate symmetric LVH
with deoressed systolic function. Dilated and depressed right
ventricle. At least mild mitral regurgitation (not likely to be
severe however). Bioprosthetic AVR - limited study and gradients
not assessed. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2135-4-21**], this was an on-call, limited, study. Findings are
broadly similar.
.
[**2136-2-3**] CXR: New confluent patchy alveolar opacification of the
right hemithorax likely represents alveolar hemorrhage given
clinical context.
.
Chest CT [**2136-2-13**]:
1. Left hilar mass with associated atelectasis of the lingula
and anterior
segment of left lower lobe and bronchial stenosis of the
segmental bronchi is likely to be accessible bronchoscopically.
2. Bilateral bronchocentric pulmonary opacity with smooth septal
thickening in the right lung likely reflects aspiration.
3. Bilateral moderately large nonhemorrhagic ple
