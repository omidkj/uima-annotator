History of Present Illness:
60 year old woman with CKD and HCV cirrhosis s/p OLT [**5-/2164**] c/b
recurrent HCV cirrhosis, who was transferred for hypotension and
acute renal failure. The patient initially presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**6-10**] with abdominal pain, N/V, worsening ascites, and
shortness of breath. She was hypotensive to the 80s so was
transferred to the ICU and started on phenylephrine as well as
empiric levofloxacin and flagyl. CXR with small right effusion
and elevated R hemidiaphragm but no pneuamonia. Diagnostic para
on [**6-10**] neg for SBP. She remained afebrile so the flagyl was
eventually stopped. Therapeutic para was performed on [**6-12**] with
removal of 4L (with albumin replacement). She was also noted to
have worsening acute on CKD. Admission Cr was 2.6 which rose to
3.3 on the day of transfer with associated hyperkalemia (K up to
6 without reported ekg changes) and oliguria. Renal was
consulted and diuretics were held and albumin challenge given,
with no improvement in renal function. It was felt likely due to
HRS so midodrine 7.5mg TID was started as well as a bicarb gtt
for the hyperkalemia. Also with thrombocytopenia to 39,000 so
patient received 2 units of platelets with increase to 114,000.
The patient's family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] since Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]
is here and she is currently being [**Last Name (STitle) 6349**] for a repeat liver
transplant. VS prior to transfer were 99.0, 95/32, 70, 17, 96%
on 4LNC (uses 2L at home).
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is somnolent but arousable and
answers questions appropriately. She arrived on phenylephrine 1
mcg/kg/min. She is reporting pain in her abdomen similar to her
chronic pain.

Past Medical History:
- HCV cirrhosis c/b variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, and hepatopulmonary syndrome requiring TIPS, s/p
OLT [**2164-6-3**] at [**Hospital3 2358**]
-> recurrent HCV and graft cirrhosis treated with interferon and
ribavirin but unable to tolerate due to anemia and lack of
response
-> recurrent hepatopulmonary syndrome with a pO2 of 75 and
evidence of shunts on echo
-> progressive decompensated liver disease with refractory
ascites requiring large volume paracentesis (~6L) every two
weeks
-> currently undergoing liver transplant evaluation
- Chronic kidney disease (baseline Cr 1.5)
- Basal cell cancer removed from face requiring skin grafting
- Osteopenia
- Depression
- Anxiety
- COPD
- GERD
- S/p cataract surgery

Social History:
Currently lives in [**Location (un) 8973**]. She is married and has 3
children. Prior to becoming ill she worked as an LPN. She does
not smoke and does not drink any alcohol, but did smoke and
drink occasional etoh up until the time of her diagnosis of
hepatitis C.


Family History:
Unable to obtain due to patient's somnolence.

IMAGING:
[**2170-6-15**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared
with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-5-21**], the right ventricle is more dilated and the tricuspid
regurgitation is increased.
.
[**2170-6-15**] Renal U/S:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Echogenic kidneys, compatible with diffuse parenchymal
disease.
.
[**2170-6-16**] MRI Torso:
1. Small left basal pleural effusion with dependent atelectasis
noted in the lung bases bilaterally.
2. No evidence for abdominal aortic dissection or aneurysm.
3. Cirrhotic liver with sequela of portal hypertension including
ascites, splenomegaly and varices.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis.
.
[**2170-6-20**] CXR: Line and tubes are in standard position. Mild
cardiomegaly is partially obscured by pleural effusions.
Bibasilar opacities likely on the left side are combination of
atelectasis and pleural effusions. There is mild vascular
congestion.
