Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
arterial line placement
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11372**] is a 66 yo female with PMH of CAD, dCHF and chronic
dyspnea with minimal exertion, afib s/p AVJ ablation and pacer,
COPD, moderate to severe pulm HTN thought secondary to elevated
left atrial pressures and not intrinsic lung disease, possible
lupus pneumonitis vs cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (based on
pulmonologist note), and DM who is transferred from [**Hospital 11373**] for management of respiratory distress and hypoxia.
.
She presented to [**Location (un) **] on [**5-15**] two days after sudden shortness
of breath and DOE which she experienced while folding clothes.
She normally uses prn home oxygen, but had used it at all times
in the 2 days prior to presentation. She also had a HA, dysuria,
right LE edema. She denied CP, palpitations, LH, wheezing, upper
respiratory symptoms, hemoptysis. She reportedly appeared volume
overloaded on CXR. She was given a diagnosis of bronchitis. An
LE ultrasound in their ED was negative for ED and she was sent
home on inhalers. She had a chinese food meal that night. She
represented to their ED the next day after she awoke and felt
worse. The CXR at that point was oncerning for pna. A BNP was
483, later up to 1050. She was given 40mg of IV lasix and
admitted. She developed worsening SOB during her stay. A CT scan
was read as consistent with pneumonitis and on [**5-16**], she was
started on IV solumedrol. On [**5-18**], she received another 60mg IV
lasix. Other complications during her stay included ARF with Cr
up to 1.9, felt likely prerenal, and hyponatremia to 124 thought
[**1-29**] hypovolemia.
.
On [**5-19**], she had an episode of respiratory distress requiring
transfer to the ICU. At that time, notes report that she was
still felt to be fluid overloaded. She was on 2L of O2 upon
admission with sats in the low 90s. Starting on [**5-18**], she
consitently required 5-7L to sat around 90%.
.
Her pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], saw her at [**Location (un) **], was
concerned about inflammatory pneumonitis and initiated the
steroids. He feels that this is probably vascular pneumonitis
and less likely hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He reports that
she has had a negative [**Doctor First Name **], normal ANCA, ACE level borderline at
73, and negative hypersensitivity pneumointis panel. Her ESR has
been persistantly elevated.
.
She was given 2g CTX and 750mg of levofloxacin prior to
transfer.
.
7.47/31/61 on 6L [**5-18**]
7.49/22/59 on 6L
.
CK 37, trop 0.04 on [**5-18**]
.
An ECHO during her stay showed distal septal and apical
hypokinesis with EF of 40-50% and [**12-29**]+ MR, moderate to sever TR,
pulm HTN with pulm systolic pressure estimated at 50-60, and
right-sided pressure and volume overload.
.
.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] (cardiology) recently prescribed Revatio on
[**2182-4-22**] to trial for her dCHF. She started in on [**2182-4-26**].
.
On the floor, she is tachypneic and fatigued appearing.

[**5-21**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = XX %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the
setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation,
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-5-3**], the
right ventricle is probably more dilated and hypokinetic than on
prior. As a result, the left ventricle is now more compressed in
the pericardial sac. LV systolic function is not as vigorous -
particularly in the septum (the septal hypokinesis is also
partly due to RV pressure/volume overload. The degree of mitral
regurgitaiton has increased (may have been UNDERestimated on
prior). Degree of tricuspid
