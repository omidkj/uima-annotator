CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please eval for bleed, infarct

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with pancreatitis, now change in mental status
off sedation
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for bleed, infarct
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Pancreatitis, no change in mental status off
sedation, please evaluate for bleed or infarct.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence for acute intracranial
hemorrhage. Multiple subcortical and periventricular
hypodensities in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres
are noted, likely a remnant of chronic small- vessel infarction.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter junction is distinct. The ventricles,
sulci, and cisterns are normalm without effacement. There is no
evidence for hydrocephalus. There is no mass effect or shift of
normally midline structures. The paranasal sinuses are clear.
Osseous structures are unremarkable. The cavernous carotid
arteries are calcified, atherosclerotic in origin.

IMPRESSION: No evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Previous small vessel infarcts. MR is more sensitive for the
evaluation of acute brain ischemia.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Pt with recent pancreatitis, recurrent fevers, unidentified
source, pls re-eval
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: Chronic and acute pancreatitis, recurrent fevers.
Intubated.

No CTs for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis
with oral and IV contrast.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are moderate bilateral
pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis. The endotracheal
tube is above the carina. There are no pathologically enlarged
axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes. There are no
pulmonary consolidations or nodules. The airways are patent to
the level of the subsegmental bronchi bilaterally. The heart and
pericardium, and great vessels are normal.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, adrenal
glands, gallbladder, right kidney, and both ureters are normal.
A feeding tube is seen terminating in the duodenum. There is
free fluid tracking down both paracolic gutters, right greater
than left. There is nonenhancement of the majority of the
pancreatic body, with only limited enhancement seen within the
head and tail. There is fluid within the peripancreatic space,
as well as within the lesser sac and anterior perirenal space.
There is atherosclerotic calcification of the descending aorta,
and the branch points of the celiac axis, superior mesenteric
artery, renal artery, and inferior mesenteric artery. There are
no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
nodes. Within the left kidney is an area of nonenhancement.
There are also two cysts within the left kidney. There is no
hydronephrosis.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is free fluid within the
pelvis. The uterus, re
