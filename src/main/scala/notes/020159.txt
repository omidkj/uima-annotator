Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central lines, intubation with mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
22M h/o surgery for transposition of the great vessels, brought
by ambulance to the ED in PEA arrest. He was reportedly in the
process of being arrested for alcohol intoxication, and became
unresponsive - details unclear. EMS flagged down by police,
found face-down with abrasions on his face. Police told EMS that
patient fell from standing position. Received epi x 2 and
atropine in field. "No shock" rhythm x 2 on defibrillator. AED
transiently showed VF, but before could shock, went into
wide-complex tachycardia with pulse. Intubated in field with
difficulty. On arrival to ED, lost pulse, in PEA arrest with
wide-complex tachycardia. Received additional epi x 1, atropine
x 1, vasopressin, CaCl, 1 amp bicarb, narcan, and one 3mg dose
epi. Pulseless for approximately 10 minutes, after which patient
regained pulse and pressure, which rose to SBP 150. Initial labs
notable for lactate 10.9, wbc 13.7, EtOH 137. ECG with sinus
tachycardia, no acute ST or T-wave changes. Head CT showed no
bleed, C-spine CT showed no fracture, chest CT showed no PE or
acute dissection.  Adjunctive hypothermia was induced using the
Arctic Sun System, and given a dose of vecuronium, started on
fentanyl/versed. Prior to vecuronium, pupils noted to be 6mm and
non-reactive. Transferred to ICU for further management.

Past Medical History:
Transposition of great vessels, s/p Senning repair [**2134**], did not
undergo arterial switch. When pt was 15yo, found to have
evidence of significant RV failure. He was treated with
afterload reduction but was not compliant. For the past several
years he has not had significant medical follow-up.

Social History:
Per family, patient social ethanol drinker.  Tobacco user
intermittently over past years.  Was student at [**Hospital1 **],
currently taking semester off.  Lives in [**Location **] with
friends/classmates.  Played baseball, currently plays
basketball.

Family History:

.
ECG Study Date of [**2157-6-8**]
Sinus tachycardia. Marked right axis deviation. Right
bundle-branch block.
P-R interval prolonged for rate. ST-T wave abnormalities. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   [**2157-6-8**]
NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no acute intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage,
edema, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or
major vascular
territorial infarction. There is complete opacification of the
frontal,
ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses, with hyperdense inspissated
material noted
within the sinuses bilaterally. There is no evidence of
fracture. Soft
tissues are normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
2. Sinus disease with opacification of the paranasal sinuses.
.
EEG Study Date of [**2157-6-8**]
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, the background was of
extremely low voltage with minimal, if any, cerebral activity
noted at a
gain of 3 uV sensitivity. The background was poorly reactive.
There
are no clearly epileptiform features.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as this was a portable
study.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were noted.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the extremely low
voltage and
poorly reactive background with minimal, if any, cerebral
activity
evident. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing. There
were no
clearly epileptiform features.
.
TTE (Congenital, complete) Done [**2157-6-8**]
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Small LV cavity. Depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Markedly dilated RV cavity.
Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis. Cannot exclude RV mass.
Prominent moderator band/trabeculations are noted in the RV
apex.
AORTIC VALVE: No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate to severe [3+] TR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
There is evidence for D-Transposition of the Great Arteries with
ventriculo-arterial discordance. The patient is s/p palliative
inter-atrial baffle (Senning). The right ventricle is anterior
and appears systemic. The systemic ventricle (RV) is markedly
dilated with severe global hypokinesis. RV thrombus cannot be
excluded. There is moderate to severe tricupsid regurgitation.
The interatrial baffles appear patent without leakage (vena cava
to LA and pulmonary venous to RA baffles well visualized). The
left ventricle is connected to the pulmonary artery. It is small
and hypokinetic. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: D-Transposition of the Great Arteries s/p
interatrial baffle palliative surgery. Baffles appear patent
without leakage. The systemic ventricle is markedly dilated with
severe hypokinesis c/w systemic ventricular failure.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-6-8**] 1:32 AM
CTA CHEST: There is no PE. The heart is enlarged with Right
ventricular
hypertrophy noted. Subcarinal and medistinal hypodensity is
likley post
surgical. The lungs demonstrate patchy airpace disease, worse on
the right
with adjacent atelectesis. abberrent anatomy including drainage
of the
pulmonarty veins into the left ventricle.
CTA ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, and adrenals are unremarkable.
Thin,
hyperdense material in the right lobe of the liver is of
uncertain
significance or etiology. The liver is otherwise unremarkable.
The large and small bowel are unremarkable. There is no free
fluid or free air.
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lesions
IMPRESSION:
1. No PE or dissection.
2. Aspiration pneumonia.
3. ? repaired transposition of the great vessels.
.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-6-8**]
NON CONTRAST CT C-SPINE: There is no fracture or malalignment to
the level of T1. Straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis is
noted.
4-mm low attenuation focus within the left lobe of the thyroid
gland likely represents a thyroid cyst. A dedicated thyroid
ultrasound examination could be performed to further evaluation
this finding as clinically indicated on a nonemergent basis. The
evaluation of the prevertebral soft tissues is limited due to
intubation. IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-6-8**]
HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles
and sulci are normal in size and configuration for the patient's
age. There is again sinus opacification involving the maxillary,
ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses, which may represent polypoid
opacification or chronic sinusitis.
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage or cerebral edema.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2157-6-8**]
FINDINGS: The heart size is enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are normal. The left lung is clear. Increased
opacification of the right lung is related to the combination of
the
