Chief Complaint:
Coronary artery disease.

artery and obtuse marginal artery.


History of Present Illness:
85 year old male that presented to [**Hospital3 **] hospital after
awaking from sleep [**2-3**] night with severe cough, nausea, and
chest discomfort.  In the emergency room he was treated for

azithromycin, and IV solumedrol due to wheezing. On [**2-4**] he
became acutely short of breath in the hospital and was placed on
bipap and treated with IV lasix due to pulmonary edema.  He
ruled in for non st elevation myocardial infarction with

he had [**2-7**] which revealed significant coronary artery
disease.  He is now transferred for surgical evaluation

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: RA not well visualized. No
spontaneous echo contrast in the RAA. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the aortic arch. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Cannot
exclude AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the procedure. No TEE related complications.
Suboptimal image quality. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Due to the patient's history of dysphagia and resistance felt at
40cm, the probe was not advanced past 40cm.
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricle was assessed in the mid esophageal views.
There is mild LV septal hypokineses. The remaining segments move
and thicken well, estimated EF 50-55% from limited study.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis but
leaflets appear to have normal motion in the available views.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2200-2-12**] 1:56 PM

Final Report
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
substantially
increased ventilation of the lung parenchyma. No pulmonary
edema. On the
left, a small retrocardiac atelectasis persists and on the
right, seen mainly on the lateral radiograph, a small pleural
effusion is present. No other pleural or parenchymal changes.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.

Radiology Report VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of
[**2200-2-12**] 1:55 [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:85 year old man s/p
CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for aspiration
Preliminary Report Swallowing video fluoroscopy: oropharyngeal
swallowing video fluoroscopy was Preliminary Reportperformed in
conjunction with the speech and swallow division. Multiple
Preliminary Reportconsistencies of barium were administered.
Oral and pharyngeal swallow delay
were observed. There was aspiration of thin liquids and
penetration with nectar.



Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old male that presented to OSH after awaking from sleep
[**2-3**] night with
severe cough, nausea, and chest discomfort. In the emergency
room he was treated for rapid atrial fibrillation and with
Duonebs, Unasyn, azithromycin, and IV solumedrol due to
wheezing. H
