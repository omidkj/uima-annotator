MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-10-28**] 7:23 PM

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; -52 REDUCED SERVICES

Reason: +/- gado to assess residual tumor burden

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 yo M s/p crani w/ resection likely met melanoma [**10-28**]
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
+/- gado to assess residual tumor burden
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAM: MRI of the brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient is status post surgery for further
evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial images of the head were
obtained without contrast. The contrast-enhanced study was
planned but the patient was unable to continue, and the
examination was terminated.

FINDINGS: This is a limited study obtained without contrast as
described above. There are postoperative changes seen in the
left posterior temporo- occipital region with areas of blood
products in this region. In addition, small areas of blood
products secondary to metastases are seen in the right posterior
temporal region. A small subdural hematoma is seen on the left
side appears to which it is postoperative in nature. There is no
midline shift or hydrocephalus.

IMPRESSION: Limited study. Postoperative changes as described
above. For further evaluation and evaluation of the
postoperative changes, a repeat study is recommended with
gadolinium.

MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST  [**2106-10-28**] 5:25 AM

MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST

Reason: L and R parietal lobe tumor
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old man with h/o metastatic melanoma left parietal lobe
and right parietal lobe. Please do at 4:00 am, OR scheduled for
7:30 am [**10-28**] thank you.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
L and R parietal lobe tumor
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAM: MRI of the brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of metastatic
melanoma, for further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal, axial, and coronal images of the brain
were acquired following gadolinium administration. MP-RAGE axial
images were also acquired. Comparison was made with the previous
outside MRI of [**2106-10-18**].

FINDINGS: Again hyperintense/enhancing lesions are identified in
the left temporal-occipital lobe and also in the right posterior
temporal lobe. Overall appearance of the lesion has not
significantly changed compared to the prior study. There is
surrounding edema seen. There is no midline shift, mass effect,
or hydrocephalus.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearances of bilateral cerebral masses
in temporal- occipital regions, left greater than right side
compared with MRI of [**2106-10-18**]. The examination was performed for
operative planning.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval interval changes

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 yo M s/p craniectomy w/ mass resection [**10-28**] continued change
in MS and word finding difficulty
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval interval changes
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAM: CT of the head.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with craniectomy with mass
resection.

TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the head were obtained without
contrast. Comparison was made with the previous study of
[**2106-10-28**].

FINDINGS: Again postoperative changes are identified in the left
posterior temporo-occipital region. There are blood products
seen in this region with small amount of air as before. There is
some increased low density seen in this region secondary to
edema. These findings are unchanged from the previous study.
Subtle hyperintensity due to hemorrhagic metastasis is also seen
in the right posterior temporal region, unchanged.

Since the previous study, there is slight increase in the
subdural collection seen in the left frontal region which
appears to be a postoperative subdural collection. There is
slight mass effect also seen on the adjacent sulci. There is
minimal midline shift also identified.

IMPRESSION: New since the previous study is slight increase in
size of the left-sided subdural collection which now measures
approximately 11 mm with mass effect on the adjacent sulci and
slight midline shift. Otherwise, the examination is unchanged.
No new areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen.
