History of Present Illness:
78F PMH colon CA, HTN, [**Hospital 76417**] transferred from
NH with BRBPR and hematocrit drop. The patient had one episode
of hematochezia the day of admission with drop in hematocrit
from 27 [**8-3**] to 25 prior to transfer. She was hemodynamically
stable with negative orthostatics. The patient was recently
started on lovenox for atrial fibrillation. Lovenox was held
[**2103-8-2**] due to guaiac positive stool. She denies current
abdominal pain or pain prior to the hematochezia, nausea,
vomiting, hematemesis, melena, rectal pain.

In the ED, VS 98.2 131/48 81 97% 8L. Abdomen benign with guaiac
positive brown stool on rectal exam. Laboratories significant
for hematocrit 23 from baseline 27, creatinine 1.2 from baseline
0.9-1.0. GI was notified. The patient was given morphine 4 mg IV
x 1 for chronic right knee pain.

Past Medical History:
1)Ventillator dependence since [**1-5**] s/p trach (perhaps due to
GBS), successfully decanulated in [**10-7**], however readmitted
[**Date range (1) 76415**] for evaluation of small tracheal mass and
desaturated in the setting of bronchoscopy and trach was
replaced. AC 0.6/500/12/5

Pertinent Results:
echo [**2103-8-13**]:The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
depressed free wall contractility of the mid-wall. The basal and
apical right ventricular free wall contract normally. The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with focal free wall hypokinesis. At least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.
Is there a history to suggest right ventricular ischemia? A
primary pulmonary (pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm etc.)
process cannot be excluded.
.
CT trache [**2103-8-8**]:
1. Moderate subglottic stenosis, distal to the tracheostomy with
minimal
luminal diameter of 6 mm.
2. Tracheobronchomalacia and moderate multifocal expiratory air
trapping.
3. Scattered ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe and
bilateral lower lobes, which may represent aspiration and/or
atelectasis.
4. Dilatation of the main pulmonary artery consistent with mild
pulmonary
arterial hypertension.
5. Atherosclerosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 78 year old female with a PMH sig for colon CA,
HTN, trach dependent transferred from a NH for BRBPR and HCT
drop with hospital course complicated by hypoxemia which
required transfer to the icu. Now s/p Y-stent placement for
tracheobronchomalacia, upsizing of tracheostomy tube to 7
french. Course complicated by a acinetobacter and
stenotrophomanas pneumona. Day [**4-13**] of bactrim and unasyn on the
day of discharge.

1. BRBPR/Anemia: The patient had a HCT that trended down during
her hospital course from 23.5 on admission to 19.4.  Due to her
potential for a complicated airway, she had a colonoscopy
performed in the OR, which demonstrated "Ulceration in the
hepatic flexure, Angioectasia in the ileo-cecal valve,
Diverticulosis of the ascending colon,
Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids, Congested veins seen in distal
sigmoid colon. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum. She
received 3 units of pRBCs during her stay. Her HCT was at
baseline on discharge. Her bleeding was likely a deverticular
bleed which resolved.

2. Tracheobronchomalacia: On the morning after admission, the
patient's oxygen saturation fell to the high 50% range and she
felt very dyspneic.  The nursing staff reported that they had
difficulty advancing the suction catheter through her trach tube
during this episode.  Her O2 saturations self-resolved.  A
bronchoscopy was performed that which demonstrated severe
tracheobroncheomalacia.  Interventional pulmonology evaluated
the patient and she had a dynamic airway CT subsequently had a Y
stent placed to treat her tracheobronchomalacia. She also had
upsizing of her tracheostomy to a 7 french tube. She had copious
secretions after Y-stent which was expected. She required
increased ventilatory support during her stay. On discharge to
the rehabilitation facility she remained on vent support with
the gal to wean vent to trach mask.  She will follow up with
interventional pulmonology for further plan for decanulation.
.
3. Acute renal failure: Patient has baseline Cr 0.9-1.0, her
renal function improved with hydration.
.
4. Leuokocytosis: patient had an acinetobacter and
stenotrophomanas pneumonia which was treated with bactrim/unasyn
day [**4-13**] on day of discharge.
.
5. Hypertension: The patient was hypotensive during her icu
stay, likely secondary to her pneumonia. Her blood pressure
improved and again was elevated and she was restarted on
lopressor and amlodipine. She also had burst of tachycardia
which were controlled with restarting of her beta blocker. Her
blood pressure medications should be uptitrated as needed.
.
6. Diabetes mellitus: controlled with regular insulin sliding
scale and 28 units of glargine at bedtime.

7. COPD: Continued on combivent

8. Atrial fibrillation: Currently in normal sinus. She was
initially on lovenox for anticoagulation on transfer from
rehabilitation. Lovenox was stopped due to the gastrointestinal
bleeding. At this time she should not be anticoagulated due to
her bleeding. Continue beta blocker for rate control.

9. CHF: an echo showed right heart failure with focal free wall
hypokinesis and [**1-3
