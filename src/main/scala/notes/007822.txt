History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59755**] is a 67-year-old gentleman who developed gallstone
pancreatitis and persistent fevers one month ago while visiting
[**Country 2559**]. He was recently admitted to a local hospital with a

emboli and left popliteal DVT. He was treated with intravenous
antibiotics and heparin. However, he continued to have fevers
and gram negative bacteremia was subsequently found on culture.

the abscess cavity. He was then trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for planned
surgical intervention.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2185-1-8**] 11:25 PM
Extensive interconnecting fluid collections with enhancing walls
and gas within them, consistent with extensive peripancreatic
abscess. No evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst
formation.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2185-1-17**] 6:12 PM
1. Interval placement of multiple surgical drains including a
cholecystostomy tube with significant interval improvement of
the previously identified peri-pancreatic abscess.
2. Development of a small fluid collection in the anterior mid
abdomen.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2185-2-4**] 6:16 PM
Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Note change in
position of tip of right subclavian PICC line, now coursing
cranially toward jugular vein.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2185-2-12**] 10:48 AM
There is a triangular opacity in the right lower lung consistent
with a small right lower lobe infiltrate. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions. Compared to the film from a week
ago, the right lower lobe infiltrate is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59755**] was admitted on [**2185-1-8**] and taken to the
operating room the following day for an exploratory laparotomy
and drainage of a peripancreatic abscess.  He tolerated the
procedure well.  For details of the procedure, see operative
note.  He was started on unasyn and gentamicin as treatment for
his gram negative bacteremia.  Following the procedure he was
tranferred to the surgical ICU for further observation, fluid
resuscitation and further management.  Lower extremity
ultrasound confirmed a left popliteal DVT, for which an IVC
filter was placed on [**2185-1-10**].  He was started on imipenem and
extubated while in the ICU.  He was transferred to the floor on
POD 6 after being afebrile for 24-48 hours and with a white
blood cell count that was within normal limits.

He had four JP drains as well as a chole drain in place upon
transfer.  He was started on TPN and tube feeds on POD 9.  His
NGT was removed on POD 10.  The following day (POD 11) three of
his JP drains were withdrawn slightly; the day after that JP #1
was removed altogether.

On POD 15 the output from JP #4 was noted to be bilious and
found to have a Total Bili of 53.4.  The ERCP fellow was
consulted after a tube study revealed a bile leak near the
cholecystostomy tube site.  After two unsuccessful attempts at
ERCP (due to an edematous duodenum), he was treated with
ocreotide, which resulted in his drain output reducing
dramatically over the following few days.

On POD 28 he was noted to have loose watery stools that tested
positive for C. difficile.  He was started on metronidazole.
The following day JP #3 was removed.

On POD 31 JP #2 was removed and his imipenem was stopped.  He
started coumadin on POD 30 and was theraputic on POD 33, at
which time his heparin was stopped.  On POD 35, he was having
more solid stooling and his flagyl was summarily stopped.  He
was tolerating a regular, low-fat diet but continued his tube
feeds by POD 36.  He was then discharged to a Rehab facility on
POD 37 in good condition, ambulating and tolerating a low-fat
diet with tube feed supplementation.  He is asked to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-13**] weeks.
