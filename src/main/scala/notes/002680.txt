[**2131-12-10**]-echo
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is partial anterior mitral leaflet flail. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. TA in 4 chamber view is 3.1 cm in end
systole.The IVC is dilated to 25mm. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] prior to surgery. All the ECHO findings were also
done, interpreted and conveyed to surgeon by Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6506**] [**Name (STitle) 6507**]
as well. POST-BYPASS: There is a bioprosthesis sitting in the
mitral position. It is stable and functioning well. There is
valvular or perivalvular leak seen. The transmitral gradient was
7mm of Hg mean with cardiac output of 5.0 L/min.The thoracic
aorta is intact. Normal RV systolic function. LVEF 55%.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2131-12-12**]
12:57 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old woman s/p MVR tissue
Final Report: In comparison with study of [**10-10**], all of the
monitoring and
support devices have been removed. No evidence of pneumothorax.
Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bibasilar
effusions and atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2131-12-10**] where
the patient underwent Mitral Valve Replacement (27mm tissue) and
Left Atrial Appendage Ligation. Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. She was hemodynamically
stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight. Coumadin was resumed for atrial
fibrillation. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor
for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge
on post-op day four the patient was ambulating freely, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The
patient was discharged to Pleasant [**Hospital **] Nursing and Rehab in
[**Location (un) 23638**], MA. in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
