Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
RCA dissection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Cardiac catheterization with 2 closed stents placed on either
side of RCA stent (placed at OSH) for proximal and distal
dissections
- Intraaortic balloon pump

History of Present Illness:
57F CAD (LAD diffuse irregularity, LCx dissuse irregularity, RCA
70-80% stenosis) HTN, AAA, HL, COPD that presenting from from
[**Hospital6 3105**] (LGH) with RCA dissection and IABP.
.
The pt was seen by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2160-4-29**] in the setting of
increased blood pressure. At that time, per PCP records, she
"had an unusual sensation in her head and her chest and she just
does not feel right". Of note during the visit her PCP noted [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
LUE BP of 150/79 and RUE BP of 124/70. Wt 167.8kg.  During the
visit her Atenolol was increased to 50mg Daily and HCTZ was
added at 12.5mg. She was also started on Citalopram 10mg Daily.
.
The pt was admitted to LGH on [**5-3**] with abdominal/epigastric
pain - stated she had never had the pain before - associated
with nausea/vomiting. Abd pain was relieved by GI cocktail. CEs
negative, EKG without signs of ischemia. The pt underwent
cardiac cath today after a + nuclear stress test that revealed
an 80% RCA stenosis. The pt was enrolled in Mass comm. for which
she was randomized to LGH-RCA stented with PROMUS 2.75 x 18mm
proximal RCA c/b RCA dissection (proximal and distal to the
stent). A balloon pump was placed (augmenting 15mm greater than
systolic, good wave form). She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via
[**Location (un) **].
.
In the cath lab, LMCA, LAD, and LCX showed no flow-limiting
lesions. There was dissection visible proximal to the stent and
spasm/dissection distal to the stent. A stent was placed to
cover the proximal dissection and a second stent to cover the
distal dissection. Final angiography revealed normal flow, no
dissection, and 0% residual stenosis. Post-procedure Echo showed
'nearly' normal inferior wall and RV function, no effusion.
.
On arrival to the CCU the patient was alert and oriented x 3. VS
97.6  57  130/63  16  96% 2L nc w/ IABP at 1:1. She was quickly
weaned off the balloon pump, which was subsequently pulled 5:20
PM. A-line was placed in right radial. She reported no CP or
abdominal pain. EKG showed NSR, Nl axis and intervals without ST
changes. Her only complaint is of recent fatigue - worse
recently.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
57F with HTN, HL and AAA that presented to OSH with epigastric
pain, underwent RCA stenting complicated by RCA dissection
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for repair now with IABP; now s/p stent x 2
to dissection proximal and distal to newly placed stent.

# RCA Dissection: Cath at [**Hospital6 3105**] for presumed
unstable angina and positive stress test showed 80% proximal RCA
lesion. A DES was placed, however the procedure was complicated
by dissections proximal and distal to this stent. An IABP was
placed and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **].
In the cath lab, closed stents x 2 were placed to cover both
dissections. IABP was quickly weaned after arrival to ICU from
cath lab. She was started on Plavix 75 mg per day x 12 months,
ASA 325 mg per day, and continued on simvastatin 10 mg per day.
TTE showed normal structure and function.

# IABP: Quickly removed after arrival to cath lab - patient had
no compromise in distal pulses

# PUMP: TTE showed normal structure and function

# Rhythm: No abnormal rhythm noted on telemetry

# HTN: Normotensive currently. Atenolol discontinued and
metorprolol succinate 50 mg po qdaily.

# Anxiety/Depression: Continued celexa 10 mg per day

# AAA: 4cm. Outpatient f/u.

# COPD: Pt not compliant with Advair/combivent. Outpt f/u

# Vitamin D Deficiency: Cont. VitD 1000U qday
