PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
======================
The patient noticed a right neck mass approximately in [**3-15**]. She
brought the mass to the attention of her physician who obtained
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis at the [**Hospital1 16549**]. Neck, chest, and abdominal CT on [**2173-4-7**] showed
marked thickening of the right lateral oropharyngeal wall up to
approximately 2 cm and a 4.5 x 3 cm lobulated, heterogeneous,
right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle that
displaced the right carotid artery. No other lymphadenopathy was
visualized and there were no suspicious lung nodules. A 10 cm
right adnexal mass was visualized. This right ovarian mass has
been stable and was previously evaluated. Neck ultrasound on
[**2173-4-22**] at the [**Hospital6 2910**] showed a 5.5 x 4 cm
neck mass suspicious for neoplastic process. On [**2173-4-26**], Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66245**] took the patient to the operating room for direct
laryngoscopy and tonsillar biopsy. The right tonsil contained an
ulcerative lesion, which was biopsied. The larynx and
hypopharynx appeared normal. Pathology was read at the [**Hospital1 **] as invasive moderately differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma. She is currently undergoing
radiotherapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted from [**Hospital **] rehab on [**2173-7-29**] with delirium.
She denied all symptoms. In the ED, she was found febrile and to
have consolidation in her LLL. Additionally, she was then
discovered to be in ARF and anemic with a troponinemia and EKG
with various territories of mild ST depression. Accordingly, she
was treated for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn. Admitted on tele and
transfused with two units.

There was some concern for an aspiration PNA. She passed a
video-swallow and was put on a diet of thins and purees in which
her pills were crushed. The patient proceeded to improve rapdily
and in the AM of [**2173-7-30**], restarted XRT to the neck with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3929**]. She stayed in house, receiving IV abx and XRT.

While in hospital, the patient was restarted on tube feeds to
ensure proper nutrition and avoid the burden that PO was placing
on the friable mucosa of the pharynx in the field of the XRT.
She will be discharged on 55 ml/hour of fibersource per
nutrition consultation. The G tube site remained a persistent
concern, however. Accordingly, we asked consultants from both
surgery and then GI to evaluate the g tube. There was leaking of
a dark and viscous fluid from around the 20 french tubing. Given
how new it was and the fact that it was not placed by a [**Hospital1 18**]
practioner, the goals of gtube management shifted to wound care.
While the site remained irritated and bled about a tea-spoon per
day, it was stable and did not bother the patient.

Overnight on [**8-3**], the patient had three dark red bowel
movements with a hct that trended from 26 to 24.4 to 19.5.  The
morning of [**8-4**], she had another large black tarry bowel movement
and was tachycardic to the 120s from a baseline fo 90-100.  Her
g-tube was also flushed and demonstrated coffee grounds, and was
also noted to have an increase in BUN from 16 to 26 from the
prior day.  The patient received 1.6L IVF and was ordered for 2
units PRBC prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was evaluated for active
bleeding and transfused 2 unites PRBCs.  Endoscopy was performed
to evaluate the bleeding around the G-tube site and clamping was
attempted, but not successful.  Patient was sent for surgery
where the bleeding artery was oversewn and the G-tube was
replaced and re-sited with another G-tube. The patient recieved
two more units of PRBCs and was then transferred post-op back to
the ICU for monitoring.  Post-operatively, the pt had episodes
of hypertension, which improved with pain control.  On post-op
day 1, the patient was hemodynamically stable the entire day.
She was transferred back to the OMED service on [**8-6**]
hemodynamically stable with Hematocrit 29.3, pain well
controlled.

On the day of planned discharge, the patient began to experience
some tachycardia by tele. She was asymptomatic and clinically
better than ever before. Nevertheless, an EKG was ordered that
was improved when compared to the admission EKG and a unit of
blood was transfused over three hours.

On [**8-8**], the patient was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for acute
respiratory distress with increased oxygen requirements.  A
large mucus plug was suctioned from the patient's oropharynx and
her respiratory distress resolved.  A CXR showed no worsening
infiltrate although there was possibly increased pulmonary
edema/ atelectasis.  The patient was continued on her antibiotic
course for HAP and was gently diuresed with fluid goal of -500
to -1L.  During the night, the patient intermittently required
increased oxygen for saturations down to 88%- this was thought
to be related to inadequate clearing of oropharyngeal mucus
plugs with a component of sleep apnea.  The patient continued to
have guiac positive stools, but this was felt to be residual
from her GI bleed and her hct remain
