Chief Complaint:
sub-acute mental status change

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65 yo M recently discharged [**2143-9-18**] after
being hospitalized for decompensated HF and for milrinone
titration, with ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), congestive
cirrhosis, BiV ICD, s/p CABG [**2115**] & [**2127**], s/p VT ablation, h/o
CVA, s/p right CEA, who presents with sub-acute mental status
change in the setting of a fever to 101.6, GNR bacteremia, and
euvolemia.
.
According to his wife, he was discharged last Wednesday feeling
lethargic and not having regular BMs, but was otherwise his
usual self until Saturday morning. The day of discharge he had 1
bowel; the night prior to discharge, his lactulose was
downtitrated because it was causing bloating and gas; he was
discharged on Lactulose 45ml [**Hospital1 **]. He had no bowel movements
Thursday or Friday on this regimen, then on Saturday he had
diarrhea in the evening, received 60ml more of lactulose from
his wife, and then had another bout of diarrhea, followed by
more lactulose.
.
Sunday morning, he presented to [**Hospital3 **], where he
continued to have diarrhea. He also spiked a temperature to
101.6F. He underwent CT-Head imaging, which upon review on
admission was unrevealing for any acute intracranial processes -
final read pending. He also had a CXR that was stable compared
to studies prior to discharge. Blood cultures were drawn and
grew out GNRs. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management, and admitted to the CCU after initially presenting
in unstable condition to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3.
.
Initial vitals in the CCU were: Temp = 99.8, HR = 96, BP 104/66,
RR 24, Sat 99% on 50% Venti face mask. ABG at that time was: pH
= 7.50, pCO2 = 33, pO2 = 142, HCO3 = 27. He was awake but
unresponsive to verbal commands.
.
Review of systems was limited, but conversation with his wife
was essentially unrevealing - no chest pain, dyspnea on exertion
more in excess of his baseline, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
no orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, or syncope/presyncope.
No myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 65 yo M recently discharged [**2143-9-18**] after
being hospitalized for decompensated HF and for milrinone
titration, with ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), congestive
cirrhosis, BiV ICD, s/p CABG [**2115**] & [**2127**], s/p VT ablation, h/o
CVA, s/p right CEA, who presents with sub-acute mental status
change in the setting of a fever to 101.6, GNR bacteremia, and
euvolemia.
.
# Altered mental status: This was thought to be multifactorial,
due to both hepatic encephalopathy and a GNR bacteremia found on
blood culture. Of note, an OSH Head CT was unrevealing for
intracranial processes. His mental status improved with
treatment of these two etiologies. His encephalopathy was
thought to be due to congestive hepatopathy secondary to CHF.
The patient was treated with Rifaximin and Lactulose and had
appropriate diarrhea. Bacteremia was treated with a course of
Zosyn and Cefepime; Patient was discharged on Cefepime to finish
course.
.
# Systolic HF: Patient was initially kept even but gently
diuresed towards the end of his hospital course with Lasix gtt,
Metolazone, Eplerenone. He was discharged on metolazone and
torsemide. His PICC was replaced and Milrinone was continued.
.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: Cr at baseline 2.2, elevated
during admission likely secondary to diuresis Max 3.4. 3.3 on
discharge.
.
# Arrythmias: s/p VT ablation. Patient was continued on Quinine
Sulfate and Dofetilide.
.
# CAD: No ischemic changes on EKG. Patient was continued on ASA,
Metoprolol.
.
# Gout: Patient continued on Prednisone and Allopurinol.
.
# Hypothyroid: Patient continued on Levothyroxine.
