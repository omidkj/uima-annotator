Chief Complaint:
Worsening SOB


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80 yo male with COPD p/w worsening dyspnea, SpO2 86% on room air
per EMS. Recently discharged on [**6-26**] with diagnosis of COPD
flare, sent home on prednisone taper and azithromycin x 5 days.
Went to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] for PCP appointment two days after discharge,
and no changes in medication and was feeling well. He was doing
well until day prior to admission when he reports worsening
dyspnea with exertion, barely able to ambulate from room to room
today. He slept overnight with 3 pillows and wife reports that
he had labored breathing with wheezing. He awoke from afternoon
nap with acute dyspnea, was reported white in face by son, and
wife called EMS. Denies fevers, but reports some lightheadness.


In the [**Name (NI) **], pt's vitals were 97.9, 79, 156/84, 22, 99% 4L. He was
given combivent, solumedrol, and levofloxacin 750 mg IV, and EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at rate of 73. He was transfered to
the medicine floor. This is his second hospitalization (first
being the discharge on [**2199-6-26**]).

On the floor, patient complained of shortness of breath, cramps
in the legs that is chronic, and productive cough and x1 bought
of watery diarrhea without blood; but denies chest pain,
palpitations, fever, chills, nausea, vomitting, constipation,
dysuria, muscle, or swelling in legs.

sounds, wheezing heard throughout, hyperinflation
Abd: ventral hernia, vertical scar, soft, NTND, +BS
Ext: WWP, no CCE
Neuro: A&O x3, moves all extremities, normal tone, follow
commands


Pertinent Results:
CXR:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The heart size remains normal
and the aorta is mildly unfolded. Again, there is hyperinflation
of the lungs. Increased interstitial markings, particularly in
the perihilar region likely represent interstitial pulmonary
edema in this patient with underlying COPD. There is no evidence
of pneumothorax and no definite pleural effusions seen. The
osseous structures appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of COPD.

EKG:
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2199-6-29**]  5:07:04 PM
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific septal T wave changes. Compared to
the previous
tracing of [**2197-7-29**] there is no significant diagnostic change.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.




Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o male with COPD exacerbation and PNA, died of hypotension
and MSOF.

The patient was initially admitted to the hospital on [**2199-6-29**].
He had been recently discharged on [**6-26**] with diagnosis of COPD
flare, sent home on prednisone taper and azithromycin x 5 days.
He was thought to have COPD exacerbation/
PNA and was treated with Levaquin PO and long steroid taper, and
remained on 2-3L NC. On [**7-4**] because of low grade fevers and
unimproved oxygen requirement a CT chest, non contrast was done
that showed diffuse peribronchovascular and periperhal
parenchymal opacities with associated bronchial wall thickening,
as well as centrilobular emphysema, concerning for fungal
infection. For this reason, pulmonary consult was called for
bronchoscopy, as well as ID. On [**7-4**], he was found to be in afib
with RVR. He was started on heparin gtt and rate control with
increasing doses of metoprolol and diltiazem. He continued to be
in a fib with RVR and on [**7-6**] triggered for tachycardia. He was
digoxin loaded an started on daily dig.

On [**7-8**], he desatted on 2L NC, diaphoretic and dyspneic. The
patient reports sudden onset of shortness of shortness of breath
when getting up to go to the bathroom. He was evaluated by the
pulm consult service for a bronch and was thought to not be
stable enough, and they intiated a [**Hospital 12145**] transfer to stabilize
him for bronch. An ABG was done which was: 7.49/34/48/27. He was
transferred to the MICU for further stabilization of respiratory
status. He was satting 95% on high flow max 95%, tachy to the
120s, with BP 116/61. Also described choking on food the day
prior to transfer.

The pt's condition rapidly deteriorated in the MICU. He was
intubated due to increasing respiratory distress. A central line
was successfully placed. Mr. [**Known lastname 8764**] became hypotensive and was
bolused 2L NS, which were ineffective. He was placed on
phenylepherine and vasopressin. He had progressively increasing
O2 requirements on the vent, set at AC with high O2, TV, and
PEEP.  Vancomycin and Cipro were added to the voriconazole and
cefepime to broaden antibiotic coverage. In the afternoon of
[**7-8**], Mr. [**Known lastname 8764**] continued to recieve fluid resuscitation with
NS and LR, to mild effectiveness. As the pt's underlying
condition was unclear, he was bronched, which showed pulmonary
macrophages, inflammatory cells and fungal forms suggestive of
aspergillus (results returned postmortem).  As pt continued to
be hypotensive and tachycardic, LR was continued at 500cc/hr. An
ABG showed severe acidosis, so the pt was given bicarb.
Nebulizer treatments were continued.

A family meeting was held, during which the decision was made to
make the patient DNR, but allow him to continue aggressive care
while intubated. Overnight, the patient's hypotension became
unresponsive to fluids and pressors, his sats dropped, he became
increasingly tachycardic. He passed away on the morning of
[**2199-7-9**]. The underlying cause is unknown; aspergillus multilobar
pneumonia is in the differential diagnosis but the cause is
uncertain.
.
Pt's other issues were as follows:

#. CKD Stage 3: Stayed near his baseline creatinine of 1.9 until
respiratory failure.

#. Tobacco Abuse: Counceled on smoking cessation. Nicotene patch
started.

#. HTN: Continued home meds lisinopril, HCTZ, atenolol until
became hypotensive with respiratory distress.

#. s/p AAA repair: Continued ASA, lipitor.

#. Depression: Continued zoloft.

#. Atrial Fibrillation: New AFib. Was on atenolol at home, but
was changed to metoprolol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control. Started
on Heparin Drip.
