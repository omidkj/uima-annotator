Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
unable to move legs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
58F with history of bipolar disorder and ?polysubstance abuse
presents with acute low back pain, lower extremity numbness,
urinary incontinence and subjective fevers. Patient presented to
[**Hospital3 26615**] hospital with a 3 day hx of fever (to 102) and
worsening back pain with assoicated urinary incontinence and
numbess of bilateral lower extremities.  Labs were notable for
normal WBC, K of 2.7 and Cr elevated at 2.7 from a baseline for
approximately 1.1  She was given dilaudid for pain, vancomycin
and ceftriaxone and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given concern for
potential epidural abscess or cauda equina syndrome.

Of note patient was recently discharged from OSH in [**4-29**] after
presenting with weakness and altered mental status. During that
hospitalization she was treated for an enterococcal UTI with
levaquin with transition to amoxicillin. She was also noted to
have acute renal failure (Cr 1.5) and hypokalemia (K 2.9) which
were attributed to volume depletion.  She had a troponin bump to
0.17 and rule out ultimately thought not to be ACS in addition
to a COPD exacerbation treated with steroids. Hospitialization
was complicated by hypotension requiring transient dopamine for
blood pressure support. Blood pressure improved with IVF and her
home clonidine was discontinued.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.3 60 117/72 24 100%. Labs were
notable for a normal WBC, Cr of 2.7 from a baseline of 0.7 and K
of 2.5 which was repleted with 30 mg PO potassium. A spinal MRI
was done given concern for epidural absecess or cauda equina
syndrome which was negative for abscess but did show moderate to
severe spinal canal narrowing at L3/4 due to lig. flavum
hypertrophy, facet arthropathy and disc bulge. UA was
unremarkable. The patient was given 1 mg of dilaudid, 5 mg of IV
diazepam, and 1 mg of Lorazepam after which she was noted to
have increased solmonence and hypotension to the 80s systolic.
She was given narcan with improvement to the 110s. She was
evalutated by neurology who felt symptoms were most likely
reflective of a toxic metabolic encephlopathy and recommened
infectious work-up with plan for LP today should symptoms fail
to improve in order to evaluate for a potential viral
myelopathy. In the ED she remained intermittently hypotensive to
the 80s-90s despite 2L IVF.  She was therefore admitted to the
ICU for further management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS.  She is agitated and
unwilling to participate with the majority of the interview. She
was unable to provide details of her back pain but does state it
goes all down her spine and that she cannot feel her legs.
Symptoms have been ongoing for the past few weeks. She denies
recent trauma to her back. She denies associated nausea,
vomiting, cough, neck stiffness or headaches. She does state she
has not had a BM in 2 weeks though she normally has them daily.
The patient further reports decreased PO over the past several
days stating "no one would give her food". She denies dysuria
but does endorse one urinary incontinence.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fechills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.

chest pain, chest pressure Denies  abdominal pain, diarrhea,
