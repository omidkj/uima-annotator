75yo man with extensive past medical history including CAD,

SVC thrombosis now on anticoagulation presented on [**2-25**] after 2
episodes of symptomatic melena, now attributed to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
tears seen on EGD. His melena began 3 days after a day of nausea
with several episodes of vomiting that the patient characterizes
as a brief gastroenteritis. After the second episode of melena
he felt lightheaded and his wife called his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] instructed
them to go the emergency department at an outside hospital. At
no point did he have any F/C/S, CP, SOB, abdominal pain, LOC, or
focal neuro sx. He initially presented to an outside hospital
and was found to have a Hct of 24 and an INR of 4.  There, he
was given 5mg vit K.

100% on RA. He had an NG lavage which demonstrated dark blood
with clots. This did not clear after 500cc of lavage.  He had
guaiac positive black stool on rectal exam. He remained
hemodynamically stable with BP consistently in (110s to 120s/50s
to 60s). His Hct was 24. INR was 4.1. He was treated with
protonix 40mg IV. In [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, he was transfused with 4 U
PRBC's and 4 U FFP to bring his Hct to 31.6. On [**2-26**] he had an
EGD which showed [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears at the GE junction which
were cauterized and clipped. He has been hemodynamically [**Last Name (un) 2677**]
since then.
.
He has not had any F/C/S, dizziness, CP, SOB, abdominal pain, or
LOC since arriving at [**Hospital1 18**]. He has not had a bowel movement

NSAID use. He reports that his appetite is currently good.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Upper GI bleeding. The patient underwent EGD revealing a
[**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear which was successfully cauterized and
clipped. The patient's hematocrit stabilized after 4 units of
packed RBS's. Coumadin and aspirin were held. Carvedilol was
transiently held and restarted prior to discharge. GI
recommended restarting aspirin 1 wk s/p EGD and keeping the
patient on a PPI as long as he is taking aspirin. Repeat EGD was
scheduled for approximately 1 month after discharge.
.
# Lightheadedness. The patient complained of some
lightheadedness with standing. However, he did not appear to be
orthostatic by vitals and did not respond appreciably to gentle
IVF. Anemia was also considered as a possible contributor but
the team decided to hold off on further transfusions. By the
patient's report he this lightheadedness was as at his baseline.
He tolerated restarting his carvedilol without problem. [**Name (NI) **]
successfully ambulated with PT and was cleared for discharge to
home with home PT.
.
# Heart failure. The patient's digoxin, ACEi, beta-blocker were
continued. His furosemide dose was increased from 10 to 20mg
daily with good effect.
.
# HTN. Well controlled. Cardiac regimen as above.
.
# Renal failure. The patient's Cr elevated to 1.3 in the setting
of his bleed and returned to [**Location 213**] prior to discharge, likely
representing pre-renal azotemia.
.
# Code status: Full
