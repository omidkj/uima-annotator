EGD

History of Present Illness:
60 year old female with COPD and psoriatic arthritis admitted
[**8-27**] with hematemesis over one day. She reported a 2 week
productive cough with post-tussive emesis that was initially
nonbloody. The day of admission, pt experienced post-tussive
emesis and noticed that vomit was brown. By the afternoon of the
day of admission, pt noted hematemesis which she attributed to a
self-limited episode of epistaxis, but the blood increased in
volume with two subsequent occurences of emesis, with clots in
the third. This prompted her to get to [**Hospital3 **], where
they found her hct to be 31 and plt 146. She was lightheaded
without any syncope. She's also had increasing dyspnea on
exertion and some right sided abdominal pain. This pain has been
present for five days, constant, though with fluctuating
intensity; she has no idea what makes the pain better or worse,
specifically denying eating as a trigger. She denies jaundice.
She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation, and in the ED her
hct was found to be 27 and plt down to 75 with an INR of 1.6.
Her stool was dark and guaiac positive, and an NGL lavage
initially showed coffee grounds and clot but cleared with 100cc
lavage. She was given 1unit of pRBCs, 3units of FFP, and vitamin
K and transferred to the MICU.

In the MICU, she underwent EGD which showed [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear
at GE juncion. No intervention done. She was given IV ppi [**Hospital1 **]
and antiemetics. Hct remained stable after 3 unit transfusion
[**8-27**] and [**8-28**] and now being called out to the floor.

Floor course (#1): As pt also complained of a severe cough and
was noted to have a h/o + PPD, her sputum was sent for AFBx3,
which were ultimately negative. While on the floor, she began to
develop malaise, fevers, and chest and back pain. Two sets of
cardiac enzymes (checked [**2-6**] depressions in V5-6) were
negative. CT angio was negative for PE. Pt also developed a
rising fever curve, from 99's, then up to 102 and 104 with
rigors and hypotension (SBP 90s, baseline in 130s), and
tachycardia (110s-130s). BP responded modestly to fluids, but
continued to drop to 90s between boluses, so she was transferred
back to the MICU.

MICU course (#2): Urine and blood Cx eventually grew
pansensitive E. coli. Pt was transiently on levophed (right IJ
placed on [**9-2**]), but was able to be weaned quickly. She received
cefepime ([**Date range (1) 15152**]) and levofloxacin ([**9-2**] - current). Cefepime
was discontinued on [**9-4**]. She was hemodynamically stable and
called out to the floor.

Here, she states that she feels much improved at this time. She
denies dysuria, noting that her urine has gotten more clear; she
does have some urinary frequency. No shakes or chills. She is
starting to have some of the achiness in her back and neck,
which is chronic and has been relieved by oxycodone. Has been
constipated - last BM was earlier this week, is starting to feel
distended. Notes that after her last drink prior to admission,
she has not felt shaky.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 60f with pmhx of COPD and psoriatic arthritis admitted with
cough and UGIB noted to have [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear on EGD with new
dx of Hepatitis C.

1.  UGIB:
Recent GIB [**2-6**] [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear seen on EGD; patient also had
healed ulcer in the antrum. UGIB Received 3 units PRBC here
total. HCT stable after EGD and pt symptom free. No vomiting
since admission to hospital.  This may be related to her use of
high dose NSAIDs (up to 2800mg daily). She is h.pylori negative.
Her INR was 1.6 at presentation and is currently 1.3; this may
be related to underlying liver disease.  She has not recieved
any transfusions since [**8-28**].  PPI (40 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and antitussives
were used.

2. Urosepsis:
Patient had episodes of fever and hypotension described above.
Intially she was on double coverage (levofloxacin and cefepime),
now just on levofoxacin. Blood and urine culture from [**9-1**]
showed e.coli (pansensitive). Repeat blood and urine have been
negative thus far (most recent blood/urine drawn: [**9-4**] at ~9:30
for low grade temp).  Will be discharged on levofloxacin for a
total of 14 days (Day 1 = [**9-2**]).

3.  Cough:
