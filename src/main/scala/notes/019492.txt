History of Present Illness:
63 y/o man with a PMHx of COPD on home O2(1.5-2L) &
schizophrenia who was presented to the ED with complaint of
cough, shortness of breath for 2 days. Additional history is
unclear, as the patient was noted to be a poor historian, but
according to the medical records, the pt was recently
hospitalized for COPD exacerbation (discharged on [**12-24**] and
again on [**1-3**]). He has recently been treated with azithromycin,
levoquin and completed a prednisone taper on [**1-14**]. He was last
seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-13**], at which time he appeared to be doing
well and without complaints.
.
In the ED this evening, vitals were initially BP 121/61, HR 111,
RR 34, sating 81% on Room air. He recieved Solumedrol,
vancomycin and levoquin. He was noted to have worsening
respiratory status and was placed on a non-rebreather. He
subsequently was noted to be more lethargic, placed on bi-pap
and then intubated. His BP dropped following intubation and the
patient was given 4L NS and was started on levophed at .03 and
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
Here, the patient is intubated, sedated, non-arousable on
fentanyl and versed. Additional history was unobtainable.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2160-1-27**]:
SINGLE AP SUPINE BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: ET tube is in
satisfactory position, approximately 6 cm above the carina and
at the level of the lower border of the clavicles. NG tube
descends below the diaphragm with tip not visualized. There is
worsening aeration, with increasing patchy consolidation in the
right, middle, and lower lobes, which may represent an infection
or aspiration. The left lung remains clear. No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: ET tube in satisfactory position. Worsening right
middle and lower lung zone infiltrates, which could represent
infection or aspiration.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2160-1-30**]:
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: NG tube follows appropriate
course. ET tube tip terminates 74 mm above the carina.
Right-sided central line with tip terminating in mid SVC.
Worsening of opacities in both lung bases, that could represent
area of aspiration pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unremarkable.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2160-2-4**]:
FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates about 5.7 cm above the
carina. Other indwelling devices remain in standard positions.
Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Multifocal
patchy parenchymal opacities in the right mid and both lower
lungs appear slightly improved. Findings may be due to provided
history of pneumonia. Differential diagnosis includes
asymmetrical pattern of pulmonary edema in the setting of COPD.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypercarbic Respiratory distress/tachypnea:
Pt with a history of COPD and recent hospitalizations for
exacerbation/pneumonia. Given this history and his CT findings,
it is likely that his initial presentation of dyspnea, cough,
leukocytosis were similar to his previous complaints. His rapid
respiratory decline upon presentation, however, is possibly due
to increased supplemental O2 and a subsequent deminished
respiratory drive. PCO2 has been in the 50's at basline per
previous ABGs. Patient was initiated on vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and IV solumedrol at presentation. Throughout the
MICU course, the patient was switched from IV solumedrol to oral
prednisone on [**2160-1-31**] and a taper was begun. The dose of
prednisone was 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] starting on [**2160-2-4**] prior to
transfer out of the intensive care unit. Patient remained
intubated from admission until self-extubation on [**2160-1-30**]. He
showed signs of hypercarbia on his arterial blood gas and was
put on BiPAP; however, he evetually required intubation again
early in morning of [**2160-1-31**]. He was then diuresed with > 2L
negative fluid balance on [**2160-2-4**] prior to extubation. His
sedation was lightened and he was extubated on afternoon of
[**2160-2-4**] with blood gas of 7.40/51/92 on face mask with 35%
FiO2 several hours after extubation. Later in the evening of
[**2160-2-4**] he had ABG on room air was 7.42/49/74.
The patient's repiratory status continued to improve throughout
his hospitalization and he was discharged to pulmonary rehab.
His prednisone can continu
