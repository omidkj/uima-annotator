Chief Complaint:
Right upper lobe mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right thoracotomy for right upper lobectomy ([**2118-3-30**])


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69-year-old female with a right upper lobe lung lesion
and bradydysrhythmias.  She had a CT-guided biopsy but the final
aspirate was nondiagnostic and the core biopsies were lost in
processing.  The procedure was complicated by a moderate right
hydropneumothorax.  She had a bronchcoscopy prior to that and
had 5-6 seconds of asystole which resolved with atropine and
tube removal.  She was counseled to undergo a resection of the
mass via right thoracotomy and upper lobectomy.  Given her
history of asystole, she was referred to the Cardiac
Electrophysiology department for placement a temporary wire
pre-operative pacemaker.


Past Medical History:
Significant for hypothryoidism, anemia, gout, and DJD, previous
deep venous thrombosis, and hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Varicose vein stripping, vaginal
hysterectomy, attempted VATS [**12/2117**] c/b asystole. She is
a G7, P6, SAB1 who had her hysterectomy because of an abnormal
Pap smear, but there was no diagnosis of cancer.  She has
received hormone replacement in the past.


Social History:
She smoked a pack a day from age 16 till [**2111**], but has been
abstinent for smoking for the last 6 years.  She only drinks up
to twice a year.


Family History:
Significant for mesothelioma as her mother worked in the [**Name (NI) 392**]
shipyards.  Her brother died of lung cancer. There is also
history of hepatoma and scleroderma.


Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS:  She weighs 191 pounds, blood pressure is 135/81,
pulse 85 and regular, and room air saturation is 98%
GENERAL:  She is in no distress and has no scleral icterus.
NECK:  There is no adenopathy in the neck region or
supraclavicular fossa.  There are no carotid bruits or jugular
venous distention.
LUNGS:  Breath sounds are clear bilaterally and I could
appreciate no wheezing.
HEART:  Regular rhythm and rate.  There is no murmur or gallop.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema.  There are venous stasis
changes bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted the day of her operation and underwent
pre-operative pacemaker placement without incident. She then
underwent right thoracotomy with RUL resection which she
tolerated well. Her pacemaker was induced into operation about
three times intra-operatively. Please refer to the operative
note of [**2118-3-30**] for further details of her operation.

She was admitted to the CSRU afterward. She was evaluated for a
post-operative MI, and the work-up was negative. In the
immediate post-operative period, she complained of nausea and
had a couple of episodes of emesis. She was administered
epidural anesthesia via a mid. thoracic catheter.

On POD#1, her temporary pacer was removed by the EP service, and
she was transferred to the floor. She tolerated getting out of
bed and sitting in a chair.

On POD#2, she worked with Physical Therapy. Her chest tubes were
placed to water seal, and her chest x-ray afterward showed a
small apical pneumothorax.

On POD#3, her anterior chest tube was removed, and her x-ray
afterward showed stability of the previously noted pneumothorax.
She continued to work with the physical therapists. In the
evening, she felt lightheaded and slightly diaphoretic. Her
blood pressure was checked and was found to be 88/48. She was
administered an intravenous fluid bolus and felt much better,
and her blood pressure increased to 110/60. A check of her
hematocrit, electrolytes, EKG and cardiac enzymes proved normal.


On POD#4, her posterior chest tube was removed, and chest x-ray
showed a stable appearance of her right lung. Her epidural
catheter was removed.

On POD#5, she was tolerating a regular diet, was ambulating with
minimal assistance; her pain was controlled on oral pain
medication, and she had normal bowel function. She was
discharged to a rehabilitation facility in good condition. She
is to follow up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.
