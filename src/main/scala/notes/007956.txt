Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38277**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary catheterization [**2137-5-6**]


History of Present Illness:
69 yo male with PMH of HTN, DM II, HLD s/p MI s/p 2 PTCA [**2121**]
who presented to OSH with cough, exertional dyspnea and
icnreased edema x2 days and was found to have NSTEMI and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization. Patient
initially presented to [**Hospital1 882**] on [**5-5**] Sun early am with 2 days
of SOB, diaphoresis and an inconsistent history of chest pain.

According to his discharge summary a number of possible
diagnoses were entertained and a variety of therapeutic
interventions were implemented. Intially he  was felt to be
hypervolemic, As a result he he was placed on BiPap, nitro-paste
and diuresed with partial resolution of his symptoms. His
diuresis was apparently discontinued secondary to rising Cr. He
also had a CXR which showed a questionable infiltrate and fever
to 102 on [**5-5**] and was started on empiric treatment for CAP with
ceftriaxone and azithromycin. He was also noted to have an EKG
showing ST depressions 1-2mm in V5 and V6. Trop on [**5-5**] at 2200
was 0.524  He was started on ASA, Metoprolol and aotrvastatin
and a heparin GTT and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for LHC.
.
Patient was taken to the Cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**] on the evening of CCU
transfer. He underwent R and L heart cath which demonstrated a
mildly elevated wedge ~16, mildly elevated PAP, diffuse dis--90%
mid LCX, 90% mid RCA, 50-60% os/LM, LAD diffuse disease, EF 45%,
septal hypokinesis, 1+MR.
.
A [**Hospital1 **] was reccomenced and he was transferred to the floor for
evaluation by CT [**Doctor First Name **]. Shirtly after arrival to the floor he
became hypertenvie and tachycardic and quite agitated with
concern for flash pulmonary edema. His oxygen saturations
dropped to the mid 60's despite being on NRB. He was diaphoretic
and agitated with notable agonal breathing. He was intubated and
sedated on the floor and transferred to MICU 6 under the care of
the CCU team.
.
On arrival to the MICU he was hypertensive on a nitro gtt,
intubated and sedated with fentayl and propofol. His EKG on
arrial demonstrated worseing ST depressions in the lateral leads
as well as 1mm elevation in aVR.
.
He became hypotensive shortly after arrival to the ICU with MAPs
in the 50's and diaphoretic. His propofol and nitro gtt were
discontinued and dopamine was initiated to maontin cardiac
perfusion. EKG during hypotensive episode showed worsening
elevation in AVR and continued ST depressions in lateral leads.
His MAPs quickly rebounded to 70's and repeat EKG showed
resolving changes.
.
He is currently intubated on fentanyl and midazolam. And off
pressors. All told he was on dopamine for 30 min total.
.
Unable to participate in ROS secondary to intubation and
sedation.

ostial stenosis with partial ventricularization of the catheter
pressure
with engagement and a 50% distal LMCA stenosis.  The mid LAD had
a 50%
stenosis.  The LCX had 60% high rising OM1, 90% tubular mid, and
50% OM2
stenoses in addition to 95% diffuse disase in both branches of a
large
bifurcating OM3.  The RCA had a 95% mid vessel and 40% distal
