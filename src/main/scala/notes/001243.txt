CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST

HISTORY: Sudden onset of severe headache.

Comparison is made with [**2124-11-1**].

There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcortical
infarction.
The ventricles and sulci are unchanged in size and
configuration. No bony
lesions are seen.

Impression: No evidence for mass or acute [**Month/Day/Year **]
.
MRA CHEST

CLINICAL INDICATION: A 45-year-old man with end-stage renal
disease on
hemodialysis, DM1, hypertension, and heart failure with severe
hypertension,
chest pain. Rule out aortic dissection.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted MR images were
acquired on a 1.5
Tesla magnet without the administration of intravenous
gadolinium.

COMPARISON EXAM: Chest radiograph on [**2125-2-5**].

FINDINGS:

Central vein catheter in place with tip in SVC.
The aorta is of normal caliber with no evidence of dissection,
intramural
hematoma, or atherosclerotic ulcer. No intraluminal filling
defects are seen.
The aorta measures 2.8 x 2.7 cm at the ascending portion, 2.5 cm
at the arch,
and 1.9 x 1.8 cm at the descending portion. The main pulmonary
artery is
enlarged and measures maximally to 3.0 cm.

There is cardiomegaly with enlargement of all four [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
Heart otherwise shows no gross abnormalities. No pericardial
effusion. No pleural effusions are evident. Decrease in size of
mediastinal lymphadenopathy that was seen on prior CT.
Mediastinal vasculature is otherwise unremarkable.

No abnormal marrow signal is evident. Soft tissues show no
abnormalities.
Pleural surfaces are clear. Visualized portions of the upper
abdomen show no abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of aortic dissection or acute aortic
abnormalities.

2. Cardiomegaly.

3. Enlarged main pulmonary artery which may be related to
pulmonary
hypertension, of which no causes are identified on this study.

STUDY: CT of the head without contrast.

HISTORY: A 45-year-old male with elevated blood pressure,
headache, and
vomiting. Assess for head [**Doctor Last Name **].

COMPARISONS: [**2125-2-5**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT images of the head were obtained
and displayed
in 5-mm axial reconstructions.

FINDINGS: This study is mildly degraded by patient motion. There
is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures,
hydrocephalus,or obvious large vascular territorial infarction.
Cavum septum pellucidum et vergae is noted and unchanged. The
density values of the brain parenchyma are maintained. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well
aerated. The soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable.

Moderate calcification involving the cavernous portions of the
carotid
arteries and the vertebral arteries, left greater than right,
are evident
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
EXAMINATION: Brain MRI.

HISTORY: 45-year-old male presents with severe headache.

COMPARISON: Head CTs [**2121-12-6**] through [**2125-2-6**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial T2 FSE, T2, GRE, FLAIR, diffusion,
3D
time-of-flight MRA sequences through the brain were obtained.

FINDINGS: There are scattered periventricular and T2
hyperintensities within the bihemispheric white matter. There is
extensive T2 signal abnormality throughout the pons. There is no
acute infarct. Incidental note is made of a cavum septum
pellucidum and vergae.

MRA: The intracranial internal carotid arteries are normal, as
are the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. The posterior
circulation is normal. Mini
