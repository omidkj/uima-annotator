Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Chest Tube Placement done at [**Location (un) 745**] Wellesly, pulled at [**Hospital1 18**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 year-old chronically ill man with ESRD on HD,
CHF (EF20%), L3 burst fx complicated by MRSA paraspinal abscess,
multiple hospitalizations over the 6 months, who is transferred
from [**Location (un) 20026**] Hospital upon request of his family after
he presented there with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] recent relevant history is detailed below:
.
-[**Month (only) 547**]/[**2128-6-3**]: admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for 5 weeks with paraspinal
abscess. That hospital stay is notable for anterior/posterior
spinal L2-4 fusion to treat L3 burst fracture. He was on the
vent for about 14days post-op, during which time he underwent a
thoracentesis complicated by pneumothorax for which a L chest
tube was placed. He required repeat visit to the OR w/ wound
dehiscence, which grew enterobacter (treated with
ciprofloxacin). He was eventually discharged to [**Hospital1 **].
- [**2128-7-4**]: admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 101920**] w/ ?LGIB. GI
evaluated the patient and deferred endoscopy as an
inpatient given the bleeding stabilized w/ minimal transfusion.
Pt had a PEG tube placed b/c of poor nutritional status: pt was
severely cachectic with diffuse muscle wasting. He was
discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
-[**2128-8-3**]: He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-8**] with altered mental
status, hypotension, respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
effusions, as well as fever and leukocytosis. He was intubated
from admission through [**8-14**]. He underwent b/l thoracentesis,
which wer transudative. Fever workup was unrevealing for source.
He was discharged to [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast on [**2128-8-24**].
- [**Month (only) 205**] (con't): Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital **]
Hospital [**2128-8-30**] to [**2128-9-3**] with respiratory failure & volume
overload. He was intubated and underwent bilateral
thoracentesis. He was extubated and discharged back to [**Hospital **]
Rehab.
- Current presentation: pt presented from [**Hospital1 **] to NWH on
[**2128-9-17**] with hypotension, diarrhea (acute on chronic),
hypercarbic respiratory failure (7.22/70/83). He was started on
vanc/imipenenem + PO vanc & IV flagyl for broad coverage. [**Doctor Last Name **]
came back + for Cdiff. His hypotension resolved. Cause of his
resp failure thought to be [**3-6**] CHF. His chronic, bilateral pl
effusions were noted to sill be present. His R effussion was
tapped on [**9-21**] and the fluid was exudative (pH 7.47, [**Numeric Identifier 101921**] RBCs,
Fluid TP 3.2, Fluid LDH 126; Serum TP 5.7, Serum LDH 122). Gram
stain showed no WBCs & no organisms. However, his cx grew out
rare MRSA, rare enterococcus. He was extubated on [**9-21**] & a chest
tube was placed on [**9-22**]. He was not started on antibiotics. A
family meeting was held with pt, sister, and mother--they
reportedly reviewed the patient's prognosis. Following the
meeting, the family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.
.
On arrival to MICU, pt is comfortable except for occasional pain
at chest tube site. He is requesting something to eat.
.
ROS: no fever/chills. + weight loss of 30-40lb over last
~6months. No nausea, vomitting, or constipation. Regular loose
stool. No recent melena, BRBPR. No palpitations, dizziness or
lightheadedness change in vision, hearing, currently, hematuria,
dysuria. Occasional LE swelling & tingling. Of note, pt has been
documented as having occasional episodes of hypoglycemia during
recent hospital stays.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48yo chronically ill man w/ ESRD on HD, severe
systolic HF (EF 20%), h/o MRSA paraspinal abscess, numerous
hospitalizations over the last 5months, who is transferred from
NWH with possible infected R pleural effusion.  A chest tube was
placed at NWH.  He was initially transferred to the ICU.  His
chest tube stopped draining fluid.  He was on Linezolid
initially for emperic treatment of his pleural fluid.  He was
stable in the ICU and transferred to a general medical floor.
He continued on his schedule of dialysis.  His antibiotics were
stopped as he was afebrile and his fluid cultures were negative.
 His chest tube was pulled and his pulmonary effusions remained
stable.  He was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-27**].
.
Medication changes: Lisinopril 5 mg started. Flagyl for c. diff
14 day course to be completed on [**10-1**]. Calcium acetate held
secondary to low phosphate.
.
Problems:
[**Name2 (NI) 167**] pleural effusion: Rare MRSA & enterococcus in fluid cx.
Unclear if true infection or contaminent. The pt was febrile on
admission to OSH, which could have been from pleural fluid
infection or c. diff.  Pleural fluid cultures were negative.
Chest tube was pulled.  Patient will follow up with
interventional pulmonology as outpatient for persistent
effusion.
.
Cardiomyopathy/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: EF of 20% (based
on echo [**8-10**]). Pt seems to be relatively well compensated at
present.  Dialysis continued as scheduled. Beta blocker
continued. He was started on a low dose of lisinopril.
.
C. Diff: [**2128-9-17**], started on 14 day course of flagyl, to be
completed [**10-1**].
.
ESRD on HD: [**Month
