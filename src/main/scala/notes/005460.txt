HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 38112**] is a 50-year-old
female transferred from an outside hospital for management of
a large saddle pulmonary embolus.  She had presented to an
outside hospital four to five days prior to admission with
shortness of breath, cough, and  chest pain.  She was
diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with azithromycin.

She returned on the morning of this admission with worsening
shortness of breath, left-sided chest pain, and cough; but
without hemoptysis, and also reported at that time that she
has had bilateral calf pain for two days.  She reported that
she had significant dyspnea with minimal exertion.  A CT
angiogram revealed a large saddle pulmonary embolism.  She
was hemodynamically stable and without tachycardia.  Her
oxygen saturations were 100% on nonrebreather mask.  A
cardiac echocardiogram showed right ventricular dilatation
and abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular
volume and pressure overload.

She denies periods of inactivity.  She does not smoke.  She
reports no history of malignancy and has had gastrointestinal
and breast cancer screening in the past.  She reports no
bleeding or clotting disorders in her family; although, she
does report that her brother at one time (while attempting to
donate blood) was told that his blood "had too much
clotting."  She denies recent travel or long plane rides or
car rides.  She has been on oral contraceptive pills for
menorrhagia secondary to fibroids.  She does not have a
history of prior deep venous thromboses or pulmonary emboli.
Given the cardiac echocardiogram findings she was offered
thrombolysis.  She initially refused but then accepted this
therapy.  She denied recent surgeries, history of stroke,
active or recent bleeding, bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled
hypertension, or thrombocytopenia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis diagnosed in [**2162-10-23**].
2.  Fibroids requiring oral contraceptive pills secondary to
menorrhagia.
3.  Iron deficiency anemia.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease, duodenal ulcer.
5.  Mitral valve prolapse.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy in [**2162-3-23**].
7.  Gravida 2, para 2; no spontaneous abortions.
8.  Status post tubal ligation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Azithromycin (day three out of five).
2.  Advil p.o. p.r.n.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.o.d.
4.  Oral contraceptive pills; not specified.
5.  Iron supplementation.
6.  Prevacid 15 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Ditropan-XL 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Vitamin E.

ALLERGIES:  DEPAKOTE and OFLOXACIN (both causing rashes).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married with two children.  She works
as a [**Hospital6 407**] nurse.  She has a remote
smoking history; quit 10 years ago, rare alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No formerly diagnosed family history of
bleeding disorders or clotting.  The patient states that her
brother was told (at the time of blood donation) that his
blood had excess clotting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Heart rate of 104,
blood pressure of 130/70, oxygen saturation of 99% on
nonrebreather mask.  In general, in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were
equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
were intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  Cardiovascular
revealed a regular rate and rhythm, slightly tachycardic.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary revealed decreased
breath sounds at the left base, otherwise clear.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.  Normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically,
alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through
XII were intact.  Strength was [**3-27**] bilaterally.  Sensation
was grossly intact.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 14.1, hematocrit of 33.7, platelets of 280.  Sodium
of 137, potassium of 4.2, bicarbonate of 22, creatinine
of 1.1.  INR of 1.1.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  CT from outside hospital revealing large
saddle pulmonary embolism involving the left side and most of
the right.

Echocardiogram revealed right ventricular dilatation,
abnormal septal motion; suggestive of right ventricular
pressure and volume overload.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  Assessment revealed a 50-year-old female
with large saddle pulmonary embolus with only known risk
factor of oral contraceptive use for fibroids and
menorrhagia.  The patient has a ? family history of clotting
disorder.

1.  PULMONARY/CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient received t-PA
100 mg intravenously over two hours and then was started on a
heparin drip.  She had no complications from thrombolytic
therapy and was transferred to the floor the next day in
stable condition.

A repeat echocardiogram was obtained on hospital day three
which showed improved but residual right ventricular
dilatation and abnormal septal motion.  Coumadin was started
on the floor, and the heparin drip was continued with a
48-hour overlap with therapeutic INR.  Her oral contraceptive
pills were discontinued.  A Factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**], prothrombin gene
mutation, anticardiolipin antibody, and homocystine were sent
off for [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 38113**] workup.  Antithrombin III,
protein, culture and sensitivity will need to wait until
after her anticoagulation therapy is completed.  Most of this
workup was pending except for the homocystine level which
came back as normal.

2.  GYNECOLOGY:  The patient with a history of fibroids and
menorrhagia and had oral contraceptive pills withdrawal
bleeding while in the hospital which was not severe.  Her
hematocrit remained stable.

Gynecology was consulted regarding future management of her
menorrhagia given her anticoagulation therapy.  They
suggested using Lupron intramuscular injections; however,
given that Lupron causes a transient estrogen levels before
it suppresses estrogen, it was decided with the advice of
Hematology that Lupron not be initiated at this point;
especially since the patient was not having significant
bleeding problems at this time.  She was to follow up with
her gynecologist to monitor her menorrhagia and initiation of
Lupron may be readdressed in the future if problems should
arise.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged to
home on Coumadin to follow INR levels with her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 38113**] workup was pending.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  In stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Saddle pulmonary embolism.


MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Prevacid 15 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Iron supplementation.
3.  Ditropan-XL 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Vitamin E p.o. q.d.
5.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. (may be adjusted per INR).

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  Follow up with primary care physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17321**].  Follow up with hemostasis and thrombosis clinic.
