Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7303**]
Chief Complaint:
Hip dissociation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left hip revision
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
69 yo F with hx of left total hip replacement 8 years ago at
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital presents as transfer with left THR
dissociation on [**2185-5-7**]  now s/p revision of left total hip
[**2185-5-10**]. She described walking
out of dinner yesterday evening when she felt a sudden
"numbness"
in her left hip, a feeling like her leg was no longer there.
Denies any presyncopal symptoms. She fell to ground, landing on
her knees but without injury or headstrike. Had immediate left
hip pain with movement and was unable to bear weight. Was taken
to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital where imaging was obtained and she was
transferred for further orthopaedic care. She had a hip
aspiration on [**5-8**] showing [**Numeric Identifier 88552**] RBC, 1000 WBC, 76 polys.
.
During the operation, EBL 1000 cc. She received 500 cc blood,
3500 crystalloid. She had 1500 UOP.  She has 2 PIVs and an
arterial line. Neosynephrine at 0.5 at time of transfer. Pt was
on neosenphrine during entire case. When tried to wean off, pt
had low BP in mid 70s systolic but when on it SBPs in 100s. Pt
moving around w/out sedation but concern for possible fluid
overload and hypotension as she appeared a little more swollen
at the end of case than before. Also got opiods, dilaudid for
pain control.  [**Hospital Ward Name **] surgical moonlighter will be contact.

.
On the floor, final reported blood loss was 1500cc, got 6L total
fluids, made good urine of 1600 and got back 500cc of own blood
from cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**]. HCT had been checked and was stable but conern
that this may be not completely accurate. Currently on propofol
for sedation given still intubated but had been moving around
when sedation weaned.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo F with hx of left total hip replacement 8 years ago at
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital presents as transfer with left THR
dissociation on [**2185-5-7**]  now s/p revision of left total hip
[**2185-5-10**]. During the operation, EBL 1000 cc; received 500 cc
blood, 3500 crystalloid and had 1500 UOP. Pt had hypotension and
required  Neosynephrine at 0.5 at time of transfer. Pt has 2
PIVs and an arterial line. Sent to ICU for management of
hypotension s/p surgery.
.
# Hypotension s/p hip replacement: patient had hypotension after
total hip replacement.  Estimated blood loss in OR was 1500cc,
got 500cc blood back from cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**] plus total of 6L IVF and
made 1600cc urine. Pt also sedated and got pain medications
which may have contributed to labile blood pressures.  IV fluid
and blood transfusions, as well as phenylephrine, were given to
achieve goal MAP>65.  Hematocrits were trended regualarly to
evaluate for blood loss.
- wean propofol --> switch to fentynal and midazolam
- titrate pain meds down as much as possible given could be
contributing to hypotension.
.
# Respiratory status/right lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray:
Because of labile pressures when tried to wean neosenphrine and
concern that pt may be fluid overload b/c noted to be swollen
compared to start of case, decision was made to keep intubated
and slowly wean off neosenprhine in ICU. Pt successfully
extubated and weaned off pressors on [**2185-5-11**]. On CXR, patient
had right lower lobe infiltrate with differential diagnosis of
atelectasis vs. pneumonia.  Sputum and blood cultures were
obtained and ....  Monitor exam, CXR.
.
# s/p right hip revision: patient had sudden dissocation of
prothesis in setting of no trauma.   She is s/p left THR
dissociation on [**2185-5-7**] and now s/p revision of left total hip
[**2185-5-10**].
- monitor wound site for signs of bleeding or infection
- appropriate immobilzation for acute phase s/p hip replacement
- monitor coags, lytes, cbc
- sugery recs
- ancef
- enoxaparin per surgery
.
# Hypertension: home enalapril dose was held given hypotension
.
# Hypercholesteroloema: pt on lipitor at home
- hold for now in setting of acute hypotension and potential for
end organ damage; will restart once stablizes
- moniotor LFTs
.
# Hypothyroidism: patient is on levothyroxine at home, which was
continued during her hospitalization.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Transfer to ICU for hypotension (See above)

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

2. Transfusion 1 u PRBC on [**2185-5-14**]. HCT 28.3 on discharge,
symptoms resolved.

The patient's weight-bearing status is PARTIAL weight bearing on
the operative extremity with posterior precautions. Two crutches
or walker at all times x 6 weeks. Hip abduction brace at all
times when out of bed.

Ms. [**Known lastname 7749**] is discharged to rehab in stable condition.
