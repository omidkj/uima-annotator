but if patient's condition deteriorated on antibiotics, CPAP and
volume resucitation for low blood pressure she would want to

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with h/o Alzheimer's dementia, DM2, HTN, possible
history of CHF p/w dyspnea and hypoxia, pneumonia, hypotension
likely sepsis in setting of pneumonia

# Pneumonia with sepsis: Patient was initially treated with
vancomycin, levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.  She met SIRS criteria
with tachycardia, WBC count elevated, fever. Her BPs in 80s
responded initially to IVF resucitation with intermittent 500 mL
boluses of NS after arrival to MICU.  After conversation with
pt's guardian, pt would not want life-prolonging treatment,
although guardian wanted to try antibiotics and non-invasive
ventilation overnight, however thought the patient would not
want lines, vasopressors, intubation, chest compressions,
shocks.  Non-invasive ventilation and antibiotics were continued
overnight, with no clinical improvement and no improvement in
labs with worsening blood gas and elevated lactate.  Guardian,
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 112033**], was called for an update and decision was made
to focus on comfort measures.  Prior to non-invasive mask
removal, patient was found to be in asystole.  She was
pronounced dead at 7:40 AM on [**2177-6-23**], guardian was [**Name (NI) 653**].
[**Name2 (NI) **] family members were available to be [**Name (NI) 653**], autopsy was
declined.
