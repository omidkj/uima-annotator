HISTORY: Cholangitis, status post ERCP with stent placement.

TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: Initial MDCT axial images through the
abdomen were
obtained for guidance for this patient's drainage. The lung
bases demonstrate bilateral dependent atelectases and small
pleural effusions. The heart is enlarged. There is no
pericardial effusion. The liver and spleen appear within normal
limits. The gallbladder is markedly distended with gallstones. A
biliary stent is seen. Pericholecystic fluid and soft tissue
stranding is noted. The right kidney is atrophic. There is a
2.3-cm hypodense nodule in the lower pole of the right kidney.
In addition, a 1.7-cm hypodense nodule is seen in the lower pole
of the left kidney, not fully characterized in this non-
contrast study. The patient is status post CABG.

After explanation of the risks and benefits of the procedure,
informed consent was obtained from the patient's wife. The
patient was placed in supine position. The right upper quadrant
was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. 1%
lidocaine was used for topical anesthesia.

An 8 French pigtail catheter was advanced into the gallbladder.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of an 8 French percutaneous
cholecystostomy catheter.

Hypotrophic right kidney and bilateral renal hypodense lesions,
not fully
characterized on this non- contrast study. Further evaluation
with MRI could be performed when feasible.


Brief Hospital Course:
74M w/ CAD s/p CABGx2, DM, gout, [**Hospital 2091**] transferred from OSH with
cholangitis and gallstones with positive troponins in the
setting of ARF/CKD.
.
For his cholecystitis with ascending cholangitis: Pt was
admitted from OSH after an extensive negative GI workup for RUQ
pain on Unasyn, admitted after clearance of NSTEMI, for ERCP
emergently. Exploratory ECRP demonstrated gross pus in the
stomach and spilling from the papilla, and a biliary stent was
placed. Zosyn was started pre-procedure and continued
post-procedure for a 7 day course (8/12/008-8/19/08). A
cholecystomy tube was placed percutaneously, and elective
cholecystectomy was deferred by general surgery until the near
future. LFTs trended down throughout his ICU stay.  Amylase and
lipase rose transiently suggestive of post ERCP pancreatitis but
trended downwards by POD2. He will have a percutaneous
cholecystomy tube remain in place until he is seen in Surgery
Clinic for consideration of cholecystectomy.
.
Acute on chronic renal failure: He presented in prerenal ARF
with Cr ~6, with likely component of oliguric ATN [**1-27**] CHF with
kidney hypoperfusion. He displayed indications for HD including
acidemia, hyperkalemia, and uremic encephalopathy. Nephrology
was consulted regarding need for HD and placed a hemodialysis
catheter for hemodialysis.  He received dialysis on [**2120-8-10**].
After hemodialysis, pt's UOP picked up to 40-150 cc/hr, with Cr
recovering to 2.2 by discharge.  He received dialysis on [**2120-8-12**]
for volume overload and 2L were taken off.  His AceI,
colchicine, statin, lasix were held due to renal failure. His
ACE inhibitor was restarted. He will need to restart the Lasix
at his rehabilitation facility.
.
Mental status change: related to uremic encephalopathy given
renal failure but there was also convern for bacteremia possible
related to biliary sepsis. Blood cx were negative. Urine cx were
positive (already covered with zosyn). NH3 levels from OSH (51)
were normal at 10 by ICU day7. Pt. returned to baseline mental
status on day 7.
.
NSTEMI: likely [**1-27**] to demand ischemia in the setting of
infection and ARF/CKD, as opposed to NSTEMI. Troponins were
elevated from OSH on heparin gtt, peaking at trop 2.19 on ICU
day 6 ([**2120-8-12**]). ECG showed sinus rhythm, RBBB with ST
depressions in V2-V4 and terminal deflection in qrs but not
significantly changed from prior tracings. ECHO showed EF 40%
which is unchanged from prior, mild-moderate systolic
dysfunction, symmetric LVH, and mild MR. Pt was started on Asa
and metoprolol, and restarted on an ACE inhibitor. Pt was
recommended to have outpatient MIBI by cardiology.
.
Restrictive lung disease/COPD: OBstructive disease [**1-27**] COPD with
superimposed Chest wall dysfunction [**1-27**] obesity and
deconditioning and restarted on home atrovent and encouraged to
use incentive spirometry.

.
Bilateral pleural opacities in LLL, RLL: Thought to be [**1-27**] fluid
overload, atelectasis.  His lasix was held given his renal
status, so he was dialyzed on [**8-12**] to try to improve fluid
status, also OOB to chair.
.
DM: He was continued on insulin sliding scale. His pioglitazone
was held. He will need reinitation of glargin
