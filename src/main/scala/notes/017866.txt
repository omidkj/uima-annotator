Chief Complaint:
psoas abcess wrapping around aorta
with penetrating ulcer growing unknown AFB organism, epidural
abcess L3-L5 with effacement and osteomyelitis / discitis at L4,
L5 level


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2178-11-13**]: s/p Right-sided axillobifemoral bypass graft;
Extensive aortic debridement with ligation of the infrarenal
aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries; Extensive
retroperitoneal debridement; Lumbar disk debridement by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1352**]; Drain placement.


History of Present Illness:
83 F who presents for admission for psoas abcess wrapping around
aorta with penetrating ulcer growing unknown AFB organism,
epidural abcess L3-L5 with effacement and osteomyelitis /
discitis at L4, L5 level.
The patient states that she acquired the infection after a right
lower extremity VNUS procedure in [**State 8842**]. At that time, she
developed shingles and was treated with acyclovir. Upon her
return home to [**Location (un) 3844**], she fell a couple of times
believed to be due to her spinal stenosis. However, she began to
use her walker more frequently, progressing to the inability to
get out of bed. In mid [**Month (only) 205**] she went to local ER. There on
examination they
felt that she had an anuersym on exam. They shipped her out to
[**University/College **] for further work-up. No sugical interventions were
peformed. She did
have multiple FNA of psoas abcess peri aortic wall fluid and
epidural abcess L3-L5. She states that a lesion on her Right
wrist was biopsied. She states her biopsies and FNA were
negative. She was treated with moxifloxacin and Vancomycin for
six weeks. Four days after her discharge, she developed groin
pain, fever to 102, and hypotension.  She was transferred back
to DHMC and treated empirically for sepsis given her
hypotension. Treated aggressively with volume. Antibiotics were
changed to daptomycin, monofloxacin. Got one dose of
ceftazidime. She stabalized quickly. Blood cultures remained
negative. The hypotension was also thought to be secondary to
narcotics. Pt also experienced ATN. On DC her creatinine was
trending down.  Pt had repeat MRI of psoas abcess after ATN
improved, showed no change in size. Vascular and NS recommended
no surgical intervention. ID recommended a workup for TB, pt did
have a history of positive PPD with no treatment. This workup
remains negative. (Quantiferon gold assay was negativ, 3 induced
sputum cx's negative). Pt also had repeat FNA, originally cx's
were negative. They eventually grew out AFB not consistant with
TB or MAC. Her antibiotics then were switched to Imipenem,
Rifaximin for an
additional 2 weeks [**7-21**] - [**8-8**],  Clarithromycin for life time. Pt
was still experiencing hypotension at this time, Vascular
recommended repeat scan which showed increase size of the psoas
abcess and worsening of the discitis.
Upon discharge pt seemed to be improving rapidly and was nearly
independent in early [**Month (only) 359**]. However, a few weeks prior to her
presentations, she began experiencing back pain, increasing
weakness, and fevers. Workup included a
CT scan that showed and enlarging paraaortic abscess.  Her PCP
referred her for 2nd opinion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**]. He
reviewed her records and instructed her to come in for admission
and emergent surgery on [**11-13**].
