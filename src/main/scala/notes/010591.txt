Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 87/55 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 58
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 15 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 12 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S4. There was an S3. The heart sounds revealed
a normal S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs,
clicks or gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was
pulsitile hepatomegaly. There was no splenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended. The extremities
had no pallor, cyanosis, or clubbing. There was pitting edema
bilaterally extending to the midshin. There were no abdominal,
femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin
and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers,
scars, or xanthomas.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 73M with complex cardiac history admitted with
decompensated CHF.
.
#. CAD: Patient with negative biomarkers and EKG changes not
suggestive of ischemia.  Patient was continued on his outpatient
doses of ASA and Statin.  Warfarin was reinstited as the INR
drifted from admission level of 3.8 to 2.0  He is to have this
checked as an outpatient to ensure therpeutic levels, which may
be difficult to maintain if patient has congestive hepatomegaly.
.
#. Pump: Patient with known dilated cardiomyopathy &
biventricular dysfunction, EF 20%. Lack of forward flow likely
contributing to renal failure.  Patient was maintained initially
on a Lasix gtt & Dobutamine gtt titrated to a UO of 30 cc/hr,
and Dopamine gtt was added to aid in splanchnic vasodilation and
renal perfusion.  The patient's outpatient doses of BB were
held, and ACE was held in the setting of ARF.  Aldactone was
held in the setting of hyperkalemia on presentation.  The ACE
was slowly added back on as the patient was diuresed and renal
function improved.  The patient was started on Bumetanide for
further diuresis.    The CHF team was following the patient and
outpatient medications were discussed.  The patient was
discharged on an appropriate medical regimen consisting of and
is to follow-up in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic.
.
#. Rhythm: Patient known pAfib on rate control with amiodarone
and toprol. As mentioned above the BB was held, although the
patient remained on amiodarone.  His dose was changed from 100
twice daily to 200 once a day.  He was also restarted on
Warfarin for his pAF and his INR was therapeutic upon discharge.
 The patient was maintained on telemetry throughout the entire
hospital stay, and there were nor events on telemetry.  The
patient's BB was restarted prior to discharge.
.
#. CRI: Baseline Cr is 2.3, thought to be due to
hypertensive/poor cardiac output nephropathy. Patient was
admitted with Cr of 6.5, thought to be due to pre-renal renal
failure in the setting of forward flow.  The Nephrology consult
team saw the patient and as per their recommendations the Lasix
gtt was discontinued.  Once his CHF was optimized and his
forward flow was enhanced his was given Lasix boluses with good
result, although did not diurese well to PO lasix.  His renal
function progressively improved with increased renal perfusion
and he did not require dialysis upon this admission.  The
patient was also restarted on his diuretics prior to discharge.
The patient was also scheduled for follow-up with nephrology.
.
Hyperkalemia: Likely a result of renal failure.  The patient
didn't have any EKG changes and serial checks of his potassium
revealed an appropriate decrease to normal levela in concordance
with an increase of his renal function.
.
#. Asthma - Patient was continued on his home dosing of spiriva,
flovent, and albuterol
.
#. GERD: Patient was continued on his H2blocker and PPI
.
#. FEN: low salt diet
.
.
After discussion with the patient and the medical staff, all
were in agreement that [**Known firstname 72233**] [**Known lastname **] was a suitable candidate
for discharge.
