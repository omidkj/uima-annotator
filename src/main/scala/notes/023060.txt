Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
R femoral hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stent revascularization of right renal artery.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yo female s/p in-stent restenosis of R
renal artery on [**12-12**]. Tolerated procedure and there were no
immediate complications. The same evening she was triggered for
hypotension with SBP~90 and responded to IV fluids. Baseline SBP
130's. Her Hct post procedure was 34 and slowly dropped to 26.1
by the next afternoon. CT scan was done and showed a large
hematoma in the R thigh, but there was no evidence of an RP
bleed. Between 7 and 8:30pm this evening there was a signicant
increase in pain as well as induration of her thigh. There was
some concern that her blood pressures had also decreased and she
was hemodynamically unstable. She was mentating well during this
time. Pt was seen by [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] surgery. She was then immediately
transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.

Past Medical History:
1)CAD s/p OM stenting: Her first OM PCI was on [**2128-1-14**] followed
by in-stent restenosis and Cypher stent to OM (2.5x18mm and
3x18mm) on [**2128-10-22**]. She again had in-stent restenosis and had
repeat DES placed in OM in [**2129-5-15**]. For surveillance, she
underwent pharmacologic nuclear study on [**2130-10-11**] that
demonstrated posterolateral ischemia with drop in SBP from 170
to 130.
2)RAS s/p right renal stent, s/p [**2129**]
3)Hypertension
4)Hyperlipidemia
5)Type 2 Diabetes
6)s/p left partial foot amputation
7)s/p right BKA
8)Asthma
9)Sleep apnea

Social History:
Lives with husband, denies any alcohol or tobacco use

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cardiac catheterization ([**12-12**]):1. Selective coronary
angiography of this right dominant system revealed no
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LMCA,
LAD, and RCA were all free of disease. The LCX had 20% proximal
stenosis prior to
the stent. 2. Limited hemodynamics demonstrated severely
elevated systemic pressures (SBP 210). 3. Selective renal
angiography demonstrated 70% instent restenosis of right renal
artery with gradient of 20-30mmHg with pressure wire.

2)CT Abdomen/pelvis ([**12-13**]):There is a hematoma within the right
groin and extending along the medial aspect of the right thigh
measuring up to 7.9 x 4.6 cm, without evidence of intrapelvic or
retroperitoneal extension.

3)CT Head ([**12-13**]):No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is
identified.

4) R Femoral U/S ([**12-14**]): Complex right common femoral artery
pseudoaneurysm consisting of multiple lobes in a wide neck. This
was unresponsive to thrombin injection. The wide next and lack
of response thrombin suggest a wide [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] defect.

5) CT Abdomen/Pelvis w/o contrast ([**12-15**]): The visualized lung
bases and lower thorax are unremarkable. Note is again made of
coronary artery calcifications. The liver, spleen, pancreas,
adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal limits. Again seen
is a right renal artery stent extending from the ostium of the
right kidney into the aorta. There is moderate atherosclerotic
calcification throughout the abdominal aorta, without evidence
of dilatation. The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of bowel
are normal in appearance. Contrast is again seen layering within
the gallbladder, consistent with recent administration of
intravenous contrast. There is no free air, free fluid, or
abnormal lymphadenopathy seen within the abdomen. A Foley
catheter is seen within a decompressed bladder. The rectum,
sigmoid colon, uterus, and adnexa are normal in appearance.
Small focus of calcification in the posterior right gluteal soft
tissues is unchanged in appearance from prior study.
Again seen in the right groin and extending into the mid right
thigh is a hematoma, currently measuring 9.9 x 5.0 cm, increased
in size from previously measured 7.9 x 4.6 cm. There is no
evidence of intrapelvic or retroperitoneal extension. There
remains no evidence of pelvic sidewall or retroperitoneal
hematoma.

6)R Femoral U/S ([**12-18**]):Unchanged appearance of complex
pseudoaneurysm with overall appearance raising the question of a
large underlying vasculature defect as the cause.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yo female s/p R renal artery in-stent
restenosis presenting with a rapidly enlarging R groin hematoma,
now hemodynamically stable.

1)R groin hematoma: Patient was transferred to the CCU for a
rapidly enlarging R femoral hematoma (s/p RA stent) and a
dropping Hct. Her Hct decreased from 34 on admission to 23.8
when she came to the CCU. She was transfused a total of 8 units
pRBCs during her stay in the ICU and her Hct stabilized at 31.
Initally there was increase in the size of the hematoma but
stabilized within 1 day of her transfer to the CCU. She
otherwise remains hemodynamically stable. Repeat U/S was done
which showed a pseudoaneurysm 0.5cm in diameter. Thrombin
injection was attempted twice but failed. [**Known lastname **] surgery felt
that this was not operable at this time but recommended repeat
u/s in 1 week. Appointment has been scheduled.

2)s/p in-stent RA restenosis: Patient was initally admitted on
[**12-11**] for renal artery stent placement. Cardiac catheterization
showed significant right renal artery restenosis of 70% which
was restented. She was started on Plavix 75mg daily, which she
will likely need to take lifelong given history of restenosis.
On discharge she was placed on Lisinopril 2.5mg daily.

3)CAD: Patient underwent cardiac catheterization. Coronary
arteries were normal and OM was patent. No further intervention
was done. Medical management was optimized with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **],
Toprol XL, and Plavix. Small dose Ace-inhibitor was started
prior to discharge. She remained in sinus rhythm, no evidence of
fluid overload. Of note, pt complained of right chest pain
discomfort. No EKG changes and in light of nl coronaries on
cardiac cath, likely muskuloskeletal.

4)Diabetes: No documentation of oral regimen at home. She was
started on an insulin sliding scale with fasting sugars checked
QID.

5)Back Pain: Patient has long history of back pain which
responds well to Morphine.

6)UTI: Patient complained of dysuria an
