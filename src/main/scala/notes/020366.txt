RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2130-10-1**] 9:31 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old woman with right cp
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o infiltrate
INDICATION: Right-sided chest pain.

COMPARISONS: [**2130-11-18**].

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: There is a patchy opacity within the
right lower lobe, which is new when compared to the previous
exam. There are no definite pleural effusions. The lungs are
otherwise clear. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: New patchy opacity at the right lung base consistent
with a right lower lobe pneumonia.
.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: 45 y.o. woman with h/o type 1 DM, asthma, now with
RLL pneumonia. She was septic and hypotensive requiring transfer
to MICU.
.
1. Sepsis/PNA:
She presented to the ED with posterior CP, fever, and malaise.
She initially had a low grade temperature and SBP in 90's.  On
exam she was alert, in mild resp distress, speaking in full
sentences. Coarse breath sounds decreased at R base. A CXR
revealed new RLL infiltrate. Pt initially started on
vancomycin/levofloxacin for sepsis. Throughout course in [**Name (NI) **] pt
developed hypotension with limited response to fluids.
Laboratories showedleukocytosis with bandemia, glucose in high
200's normal hematocrit, lactate 2.2, after 4 L, pt SBP in
70's--code SEPSIS called.  Central line placed, CVP at 22
despite IVF, MVO2 95.  Levophed started.  No insulin given
during 8 hr ED stay. Pt transferred to MICU.
.
In MICU, a-line placed, pt blood pressure found to be high
normal.  Levophed weaned off.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal; no
steroids given. The blood pressure improved with multiple liters
of NS bolus, titrated to CVP. By HD 2, pt remained afebrile,
normo-hypertensive, with her breathing subjectively improved,
her R chest pain resolved and her WBC trending downward. Abx
changed to azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community acquired
PNA.It was deemed safe for her to transfer to medical floor on
HD #3.
.
2. Resp distress:
pt was noted to have an oxygen requirement on arrival to the
MICU, with initial ABG 7.21/31/79, c/w DKA/lactic acidosis and
poor oxygenation. The pt had a history of asthma was found to be
wheezing on exam. She was treated with nebulizers and inhaled
corticosteroids. ABGs showed improved oxygenation on the
following day.
  After transfer to the medicine floor, the pt continued to have
an oxygen reequirement with mild resp distress for several days.
This was felt to be likely multifactorial: PNA, pulmonary edema
from volume overload(massive IVF in MICU, though normal cardiac
fxn by echo), and asthma exacerbation contributing. Advair and
PRN albuterol and atrovent nebs were continued. Lasix was given
as needed for diuresis. Abx for the PNA were continued.
.
3. DKA/diabetes:
In the ED, glucose was up to 300's range, ABG and repeat
chemistries c/w diabetic ketoacidosis. Insulin drip was started.
Glucose returned to [**Location 213**] range. Anion gap resolved by
following night. Insulin drip stopped.
   On the medicine floor, the pt was put back on her Lantus at
home dose 30U in evening and Humalin SS. [**Last Name (un) **] consult was
obtained to help with diabetes management.
.
4) Sinus tach: The rate persisted at 100-130 over the course of
admission. This was assessed to be likely [**3-15**] infection. ECG
shows NSR, nl intervals, no ischemic changes. There was very low
clinical suspicion for PE. It was monitored and remained stable.
.
5. HTN: BP elevated. Likely her baseline HTN aggravated by
illness, and volume overload. Cozaar was used for BP control,
avoiding beta blockade in setting of asthma.
.
6. Anemia: stable. Hct drop from 39.5 to 30.4 after several
liters of IVF. Now 30.0. Stable for the last 3 days. Likely
dilutional. Plt count is stable.
-monitor
.
7. HA: tylenol PRN.
8. Hyperlipidimemia: lipitor.
10. PPx: PPi dc'd. On Bowel regimen and SC heparin for dvt ppx.

11. ACCESS: Right IJ placed [**10-1**] d'cd [**10-2**]. [**10-1**] A-line. 2 PIV.
