Service:  CCU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82 year old man
status post three vessel CABG in [**2085**] (SVG to LAD, SVG to
OM2, SVG to PDA) who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on
[**2106-7-8**] with one week history of exertional chest pressure
which occurred only at night, nonradiating.  Chest pressure
nausea, vomiting.  It was unlike symptoms of prior MI.  Chest
pressure was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  Patient
initially did not want to go for further workup, but was
urged by wife and granddaughter to go to the hospital.  At
[**Hospital1 1474**] he was ruled out with negative cardiac enzymes (peak
CK 96, troponin less than 0.3).  At [**Hospital1 1474**] he attempted an
exercise treadmill test, however, patient was unable to walk
refused, therefore, he was taken to cardiac catheterization
on [**2106-7-12**].  The catheterization showed 90% left main
LAD which was totally occluded, left circumflex which was
totally occluded, RCA which had a 90% mid-lesion, SVG to LAD
graft was 90% occluded, SVG to OM2 was totally occluded, SVG
to PDA was also totally occluded.  He was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
for percutaneous intervention.  Cath here showed RCA with 70%
proximal, 80% mid and distal occlusion, elevated filling
pressures (cardiac index 4.1, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 16, RA 12).  RCA was stented in two locations with
0% residual.  Cardiac catheterization, however, was
complicated by microperforation which was treated with
perfusion balloon inflation.  Effective hemostasis was
achieved in the cath lab and a TTE was done which showed only
a small pericardial effusion.  He was then sent to the CCU
for hemodynamic monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease.  BPH.  Atrial
flutter.  TIA.  Glaucoma (legally blind).  IMI ([**2100**]).
Pacemaker.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Three vessel CABG ([**2085**]).
Appendectomy.  Hernia repair.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tobacco 50 pack years, but quit 25 years
ago.  Alcohol one to two glasses of wine per week.  He lives
at home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is active around the house.  He
works frequently in his garden without any dyspnea.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg q.d., atenolol 50 mg
q.d., Bumex 1 mg p.o. t.i.d., Zocor 20 mg q.d., Coumadin
3.5 mg q.d., Prevacid 30 mg q.d., Alphagan eyedrops, K-Dur
10 mEq q.d., colchicine 0.6 mg p.r.n. q.one to two hours,
Flomax 0.4 mg q.d., Nitrocaps.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical exam on admission to CCU
showed vital signs temperature of 97.8, blood pressure
106/68, heart rate 94 which was V-paced with occasional PVCs,
respiratory rate 18, SaO2 95% on nasal cannula.  In general,
patient was in no apparent distress, laying flat comfortably
in bed.  Oropharynx was clear.  Mucous membranes were
slightly dry.  JVP was approximately 10 to 12 cm.  Neck was
supple.  He had anicteric sclerae.  Chest was clear to
auscultation anteriorly (patient was laying flat due to
femoral catheter).  Cardiovascular exam showed an irregularly
irregular rate, distant heart sounds, but no murmurs, gallops
or rubs appreciated.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended,
nontender, normoactive bowel sounds with no
hepatosplenomegaly.  On extremity exam the right groin site
was without oozing.  There was a 2 x 4 cm stable hematoma.
No bruit was present.  He had 1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses bilaterally.  Skin was warm and dry.  On neuro
exam pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  There
was no tracking secondary to patient's blindness.
Extraocular muscles were intact by command.  He was alert and
oriented times three.  There were no gross motor or sensory
deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count 8.1, hemoglobin
10.3, hematocrit 28.9, platelets 151.  Chemistry panel sodium
142, potassium 4.4, chloride 113, bicarb 17, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.6, glucose 173.  PT 15.5, PTT 45.2, INR 1.7.
EKG done post catheterization showed native beats and right
bundle branch morphology with first degree AV block which was
interspersed with multifocal PVCs and infusion with paced
beats.  Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2106-7-15**] showed EF
less than 20%, severe regional left [**Date Range 14965**] systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of anterior septum, anterior and
inferior walls, remaining walls hypokinetic.  Moderate 2+ MR.
[**First Name (Titles) 167**] [**Last Name (Titles) 14965**] hypokinesis without pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 82 year old with unstable angina
status post three vessel CABG in [**2085**] with stenosis of all
graft vessels.  Cardiac catheterization times two, once at
[**Hospital1 1474**] and once at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2106-7-12**] with stents placed
times two to native RCA which was complicated by
microperforation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Coronary artery disease.  Cardiac catheterization showed
stenosis of all bypass grafts.  Therefore, intervention was
aimed at reperfusion of native vessels.  RCA was initially
stented on the 22nd with good reflow, however, it was
complicated by microperforation.  Serial echocardiograms
ruled out significant pericardial effusion which was shown to
have resolved on the day of discharge.  On the 23rd patient
was taken back to the cath lab at which time SVG to LAD was
stented which showed 0% residual stenosis.  Serial cycling of
cardiac enzymes showed peak CK at 1139 on the 23rd in the
evening with peak CKMB of 156 and an index of 21.3.  Due to
the magnitude of the CK and CKMB increase, it was thought
that the patient had a fairly large MI.  He was continued on
aspirin and Plavix was added for 30 days post cath to prevent
stent thrombosis.

2.  CHF.  Prior to current hospital admission patient had a
stress MIBI done in [**10-22**] at an outside hospital which showed
an EF of 46%.  However, during current admission serial
echocardiograms were done which showed a severely depressed
EF of 20%.  It was thought that the extensive MI was
responsible for the rapid decline in patient's cardiac
function.  Patient was effectively diuresed with Lasix which
showed marked improvement in lung exam as well as decrease in
jugular venous pulsation.  He was started on lisinopril 2.5
q.d. for afterload reduction.  Patient tolerated the start of
the ACE inhibitor fairly well without dramatic decrease in
blood pressure.  Patient's baseline systolic blood pressure
runs around 90.

3.  Cardiac arrhythmia.  Patient with known AS status post
pacemaker placement.  Throughout hospital course patient was
monitored on telemetry which showed a combination of paced
beats as well as underlying native beats and fusion rhythm.
He was restarted on Coumadin, however, at a lower dose than
outpatient dose due to start of Plavix.  It was recommended
for his Coumadin dose to be adjusted to an INR of 1.8 to 2.0
while he continues Plavix.

4.  Hematology.  Patient on presentation had hematocrit of
28.9 which fell to 26 after the second catheterization while
in-house.  Patient reports some baseline chronic anemia.
However, it was thought that the etiology of acute drop in
hematocrit was due to right groin hematoma which was present
after first catheterization.  Hematoma resolved spontaneously
and patient's hematocrit stabilized at 30 with transfusion of
three units of packed red blood cells total during hospital
admission.  Of note, he was guaiac negative.

5.  Disposition.  Patient was evaluated by physical therapy
while in-house who achieved all in-house P.T. goals.  Upon
discharge it was recommended for him to follow up with
at-home physical therapy for cardiac rehabilitation three to
four times a week.
