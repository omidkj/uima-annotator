Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Coronary cath [**3-23**] with POBA to SVG-PDA


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMH CAD s/p CABG [**2153**] with SVG to RPDA, SVG to LAD,
SVG to diagonal, s/p PCI to SVG-Diag 100% occluded, DES to
SVG-LAD graft in [**4-29**], DESx2 to SVG-RPDA in [**9-30**], BMS to SVG-RCA
in [**10-1**], DES to SVG to LAD [**2175**] and DES x2 to proximal and mid
SVG to LAD in [**1-4**], and DESx2 to proximal and ostial [**Date Range **] in
[**2-5**]; right renal artery stenosis s/p stenting [**3-31**], [**Month/Year (2) 2091**], DMII,
HLD, HTN, ???GI bleed, small AAA presenting to OSH with chest
pain. Pt described the quality of the same as the same as that
which occurred prior to his previous stent placements - it was a
pressure, located in the center of his chest, nonradiating,
accompanied by intermittent SOB, "feeling hot," and
palpitations. It was also accompanied by dizziness and weakness
which was new for him. It was also more severe than any other
pain he has ever had, nearly bringing him to tears. No nausea,
vomiting, or diaphoresis. It lasted 30 minutes and was relieved
after taking 5 tabs of nitro. He was watching television when
the pain began. He states that he has had the pain 6 times over
the past week; all episodes occurred in the evening when he was
either lying in bed or just getting into bed. The pain has not
occurred during the day or with exertion. He denies h/o reflux
symptoms. States he eats dinner around 6pm. No fevers, chills,
abdominal pain, muscle aches, joint pains. Admits to SOB when
lying down and has become SOB at night before. Admits to cough
productive of white phlegm for about 1 week now. Also has a
runny nose. Sister has been sick but otherwise no sick contacts.
[**Name (NI) **] been constipated the past few days. Has been undergoing
treatment for diverticulitis with flagyl since hospitalization
at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2178-3-14**]. Does not like flagyl and says it
gives him an acid taste in his mouth. Last dose [**2178-3-24**]. Has
been taking of his medications as prescribed daily.
.
At OSH, initial VS were 98.1, 181/103, 68, 18, 98% O2. He
reportedly had initial improvement and then recurrence of the
chest pain during which he became pink, appeared uncomfortable,
and was warm to the touch. He was lying down when the pain
occurred. He was given ativan, a GI cocktail, morphine, imdur,
and nitro gtt at various points in the ED there and it is
unclear which of these helped his pain. He was started on
heparin gtt at 1000 units/hr and nitro gtt at 10 mcgs. He was
also given bicarb 100/hr and mucomyst 600 mg po for possibility
of cath with his CRI. EKG's taken at the onset and peak of the
pain were unchanged. Labs there were significant for trop 0.02
and Hct 32.7. An echo showed moderately dilated LA, LVEF 55-60%,
and "distolic dysfunction." EKG showed stable biphasic t-waves
in V2-V4 and stable RBBB. There was borderline [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 8730**]. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cardiac cath but with
question as to cardiac nature of pain.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.2, 66, 141/70, 18, 100%. Labs
significant for Hct 29.5, WBC 3.3, INR 1.1, lipase 32, LFTs WNL,
Cr 2.6, BUN 37, trop 0.01. Pt was continued on nitro gtt and
heparin gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] service.
.
On arrival to the floor, VS 98.3, 160/83, 75, 20, 98% RA. He
currently denies CP or SOB.
