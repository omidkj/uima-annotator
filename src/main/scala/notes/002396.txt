Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Pre-TACE hydration

Reason for Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: Hypoxemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Bronchoscopy
Left radial arterial line

History of Present Illness:
61F with pancreatic neuroendocrine CA metastatic to the liver
s/p CBD stent and chronic diastolic CHF admitted to OMED [**12-6**]
for hydration prior to TACE on [**12-7**]. Started on zosyn [**12-6**],
followed by vanc/cefepime/flagyl on [**12-9**] for possible
aspiration pneumonia. Notably, CT chest [**12-11**] showed ethiodol
uptake in the lung, concerning for a portosystemic shunt.
Azithromycin was added [**12-15**], and cefepime was stopped in favor
of levo/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] on [**12-15**]. She has also been treated with bolus
diuresis for acute diastolic CHF. She states that she felt as if
she was improving on treatment as of yesterday but then became
more short of breath with minimal exertion, with a cough
productive of yellow-light green sputum. She endorses orthopnea
but denies PND. No fever, chills, sweats, chest pain,
palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or calf pain.
On routine vitals found to have O2sat 88%5L (had been on 5L NC
since [**12-14**]) - improved to 92-94%8L FM. Given lasix 20 mg IV
with 300 UOP. ABG on NRB 7.45/47/72/34. CXR showed extensive
right-sided airspace disease. Vital signs prior to transfer 97.3
102/59 95 22 98%NRB.

Past Medical History:
Oncologic History (from Dr.[**Name (NI) 52983**] [**9-16**] note)
[**1-6**]: Had UGI bleeding, EGD revealed gastric ulcer (official
report unavailable)
[**2-7**]: Developed chronic fatigue and anorexia soon after
returning home from let hip and knee surgery.
[**3-10**]: Presented to PCP with [**Name9 (PRE) 5283**] pain and worsening jaundice for

2 weeks. RUQ US demonstrated pancreatic head mass and multiple
liver nodules suspicious for metastasis. Admitted to [**Hospital **]
hospital, where CT scan confirmed US findings. ERCP at [**Hospital1 18**]
demonstrated duodenal invasion (with stigmata of recent
bleeding,) and extrinsic compression of CBD, which was stented.

Duodenal biopsy returned poorly differentiated neuroendocrine
carcinoma. MRCP demonstrated numerous hepatic  metastases.
US-guided biopsy of one hepatic lesion revealed same findings as
duodenal biopsy. The picture was consistent was metastatic,
poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.

ulcer in [**11/2186**] and 12/[**2187**].

INTERNVETION
===============
[**2189-12-7**]
- Common hepatic artery and left hepatic artery arteriogram.
- Transarterial chemoembolization of the left lobe of liver.
- Angio-Seal closure device deployment to the right common
femoral artery
access site.
FINDINGS:
1. There is conventional celiac axis anatomy as demonstrated on
previous
arteriograms.
2. Common hepatic artery arteriogram demonstrates multiple
arterially
enhancing masses throughout both lobes of liver.
3. The left hepatic artery arteriogram confirmed large enhancing
masses in the left lobe of liver, which was successfully
targeted with the
chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**], with 60 mg of doxorubicin, 20 mL of
lipoidol, and 20 mL of intra-arterial lidocaine, and one and a
half vials of 100-300 micron Embospheres administered.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory left hepatic artery chemoembolization

======================
IMAGING
======================
[**2189-12-8**]
- CT Abdomen/Pelvis: There is dependent atelectasis at the
bilateral lung bases without effusion or focal consolidation to
suggest pneumonia. Some hyperdensity is newly seen at the lung
bases, which most likely reflects systemic ethiodol distribution
secondary to small intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Coronary
calcifications are noted. Hyperdense material within multiple
right lobe liver lesions is stable from [**2189-11-13**],
compatible with sequelae of prior chemoembolization.
Additionally, there is newly noted extensive hyperdense material
within the left lobe of the liver and caudate lobe, most
concentrated at the sites of previously noted
arteria
