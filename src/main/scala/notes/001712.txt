Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Percocet / Tylenol / Warfarin / fentanyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
agitation, AFib with RVR, multifocal PNA
Reason for MICU transfer: increased nursing requirement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
59yoM with h/o AFib, asthma, BOOP, DM2, spinal stenosis and
chronic back pain and high narcotic requirement at baseline, now
s/p L1-2 total laminectomy, fusion of L1-3, reomval of previous
instrumentation L3-5 and autograft on [**2180-5-15**].

His post op course has been complicated by HAP, ? aspiration,
delirium, and AFib with RVR. Pain management has been following
her given high narcotic requirement and difficulty managing post
op pain, and post-op he was on a Ketamine gtt.

He was having delirium with hallucinations and periods of
unresponsiveness, and his chronic pain meds were decreased and
started on PRN Zyprexa. He spiked a fever [**5-17**] and CXR showed
multifocal PNA, so started on Vancomycin and Ceftazadime for
HCAP, went to SICU. BP's have been variable between 200/100 on
arrival to TSICU and then noted to be hypotensive to 80/50 which
responded well to IVF's and albumin. EKG has been noted to have
some ST depressions V3-5 but negative Trops. Hct noted to
decrease from 28 on admission to 23 through course, stable
thereafter. AFib with RVR has been addressed with uptitration of
PO Diltiazem and apparently also with Metoprolol (? -- not noted
on transfer from floor).

Pt was transferred from TSICU to Medicine floor late pm of [**5-22**]
and was switched from Vanc/Ceftaz to Vanc/Zosyn. He triggered on
the floor for AFib with RVR, agitation, delirium. Noted to be in
pain, turning from left to right, temp noted 100.6 and RVR to
150 but other vitals stable. Dilt ER changed to 60 qid, given 10
mg IV Dilt, given Zyprexa 5mg PO.

ROS: On arrival to MICU pt sleeping comfortably, awoken and
conversant, and denied any symtpoms, no SOB, CP, abd pain, n/v.
Knew where he was and was calm.

PERTINENT STUDIES:
# L-spine ([**5-15**])
Single cross-table lateral demonstrates posterior fusion with
rods and pedicle screws as well as retractors. Please refer to
operative note for full details.

# portable CXR ([**5-18**])
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-17**], there is little
overall
change. There is persistent enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with low
lung volumes and evidence of increased pulmonary venous
pressure. There may be minimal blunting of the costophrenic
angles bilaterally.

# portable CXR ([**5-19**])
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-17**] and 23:
Large scale multifocal consolidation, although accompanied by
pulmonary
vascular congestion, is quite likely multilobar pneumonia.
Moderate right
pleural effusion has increased. Heart size is normal.
Mediastinum is not
widened. Right subclavian line ends in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27362**]
was paged at the time of dictation.

# CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2180-5-23**] 7:16 AM
Consolidation at the lung bases, left greater than right,
worsened
substantially at least on the right side between [**5-18**] and
[**5-19**]. Some of that interval change was due to concurrent
pulmonary edema which persists, but bibasilar consolidation is
improving. At least a small volume of right pleural fluid is
present, some still in the major fissure. Heart is top normal
size, pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement persists.
Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.

# ECHO   [**2180-5-24**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitr
