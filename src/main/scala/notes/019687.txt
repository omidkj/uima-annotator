Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2184-8-5**]: Cardiac catheterization, no intervention

History of Present Illness:
72 yo F with PMHx of 2vessel CAD s/p RCA atherectomy in '[**67**],
HTN, morbid obesity, Hyperlipidemia who presents with dyspnea x
3days , worse past day with a dry cough. Symptoms started
abruptly on Sunday night with SOB while walking to bathroom. SOB
remaind persistent over the following days, with worsening DOE.
She initially presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5678**] hospital and was found to
be hypotensive and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with suggested
diagnosis of PNA, incidentally found to have elevated troponin
of 1.73.  She was started on heparain at OSH. Received azithro
and Ceftriaxone at OSH. Was on neo at 100 mcg. Got RIJ in our
ED. Crackles at bases, Febrile to 100.1. Gave levofloxacin. Put
on levophed in ED. O2 sat high 90's on 4L. CXR here appears to
have bilateral infiltrates. ECG here afib rate [**Street Address(2) 5679**]
elevations V4-V6. Patient denies chest pain.
.
On review of systems (limited as pt poor insight), she denies
any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
but worsening dyspnea on exertion, she endorses unchanged
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and nocturia, orthopnea which is
unchanged, no ankle edema, no palpitations, no syncope or
presyncope.
.

2D ECHO [**2184-8-4**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal 2/3rds of the ventricle. The remaining basal segments
contract normally (LVEF = 20-25 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic root and ascending aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion.There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
biventricular cavity size and extensive systolic dysfunction c/w
diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.) At
least mild moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending
aorta.
.
CHEST XRAY [**2184-8-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Satisfactory right IJ line position.
2. Edeme-like pattern suggestive of volume overload/heart
failure. Repeat
radiography after diuresis recommended to assess for underlying
infection.
3. If necessary repeat PA/lateral could help better evaluate the
right lung base given the concern for pneumonia.
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2184-8-5**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
diffuse calcific coronary artery disease. The LMCA was not
well-visualized.
The LAD was highly calcified, and had a 90% ostial lesion with
diffuse
disease throughout the mid-portion of 90%. The LCX was tortuous
and was
without any angiographically apparent disease. The RCA was
calcified
and had a 60% stenosis in the mid-portion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling
pressures with mean RA pressure of 21 mmHg and mean PCW pressure
of 33
mmHg.  The patient also had elevated pulmonary artery pressures
with
mean PA pressure of 42 mmHg and peak PA pressure of 71 mmHg.
Both mean
and peak PA pressures decreased during the case following
administration
of IV furosemide. The cardiac output, calculated from the Fick
equation,
was normal at 5.5 L/min.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel severe coronary artery disease not well suited
for PCI.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F hx CAD s/p atherectomy in '[**67**], HTN, HLD, paroxysmal
atrial fibrilliation (not anticoagulated), and morbid obesity
who presented subacutely with anterior STEMI and systolic
congestive heart failure.
.
# CORONARIES: Coronary cath on [**2184-8-5**] showed 90% mid-LAD disease
and 60% stenosis of mid-RCA but tortuous, calcific vessels that
were not amenable to intervention. Patient's anterior STEMI was
medically managed with aspirin 81 mg, Plavix 75 mg, Atorvastatin
80 mg, and metoprolol. She was started on 81 mg dose of aspirin
to minimize risk of hemorrhage sec
