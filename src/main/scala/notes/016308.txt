Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2181-2-23**] - Mitral valve repair with a triangular resection of the
middle scallop of the posterior leaflet (P2) and mitral valve
annuloplasty with a 32-mm St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical saddle ring.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old male who presented to his PCP several
months ago with complaints of weight loss and lower extremity
edema. He was noted to have heart murmur and found to be in
atrial fibrillation. Subsequent echocardiogram revealed mitral
valve prolapse with significant regurgitation, and some degree
of aortic stenosis. Over the last several months, his pedal
edema has improved with medical therapy. He denies any history
of SOB at rest and chest pain but does admit to DOE. His weight
has remained stable for the last two months and
patient/family reports that workup for weight loss(ie "scans")
have been unrevealing. He reports an increase in appetite in the
past month. He admits today for heparin bridge with plans for OR
in the am for MV repair vs replacement / ? AVR / ? MAZE.

Pertinent Results:
[**2181-2-23**] Echo: Pre-bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated. A patent
foramen ovale is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 %). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet
of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12130**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2181-2-18**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. Heparin was started as a
bridge to surgery. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner. As his INR was quite slow to reach a safe range for
surgery, his surgery was delayed a few days. On [**2181-2-23**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 12130**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a
mitral valve repair with a triangular
resection of the middle scallop of the posterior leaflet (P2)
and mitral valve annuloplasty with a 32-mm St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical
saddle ring. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He did require Inotropes post-op for hemodynamic
support and were weaned off on post-op day 3. He did receive a
blood transfusion for hematocrit 26%.  Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. On post-op day four he was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care.  Physical therapy was
consulted for assistance with post-op strength and mobility.  By
POD 5 the patient was found suitable for transfer to rehab.  By
this time the wound was healing, pain was controlled with oral
analgesics, and the patient was ambulating with supervision.
