ECG
Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 123. Early
transition. Diffuse non-specific T wave changes. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

[**2146-11-21**]
CXR:
PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained. The heart is
moderately enlarged. Mild interstitial prominence within the
lungs could indicate chronic lung disease and clinical
correlation is advised. No gross CHF. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Aorta is unfolded. Bony structures appear grossly
intact.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly. Prominence of the interstitial
markings could
reflect interstitial lung disease for which clinical correlation
is advised.

ECHO [**11-25**]-The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 80F with RA on prednisone and chronic diastolic CHF
admitted with shock and afib with RVR.

#Sepsis from urinary tract infection. Patient presented with
fever, dysuria, and positive UA on the background of hypovolemia
[**2-1**] poor oral intake and vomiting, complicated by rate-related
hypotension from poor distolic filling time in the setting of
rapid AF.  She required phenylepherine the night of ICU
admission.  Her initial antibiotics were vancomycin and zosyn,
but vancomycin was discontinued as E coli was growing out on
[**2146-11-22**].  She was switched from Zosyn to ceftriaxone as the
E. coli turned out to be pan-sensitive on [**2146-11-23**]. This was
changed to PO cipro on the medical floor. She will need 2 weeks
of antibiotics for acute complicated urinary tract infection.
She also received stress dose steroids given that she is on
chronic steroids as an outpatient. This was weaned down to
prednisone 20 mg with instructions to further wean to home dose.


#Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Upon further review, pt states
that this not new and she was told she had afib during an OR
procedure in the past.  Current afib with RVR likely promoted by
increased sympathetic drive in the setting of septic shock and
baseline chronic diastolic CHF.  Pt had an
