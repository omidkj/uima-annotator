Admission Date: [**2173-12-23**]        Discharge Date: [**2173-12-31**]

Date of Birth:  [**2108-4-13**]        Sex:  F

Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old woman with
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, question CAD,
diabetes mellitus, OSA with increased dyspnea and hypoxia x2
weeks, especially increasing over the past two days prior to
admission, has required constant CPAP for the past two-and-a-
half weeks.  Of note, the patient's Lasix dose was decreased
from 100 mg b.i.d. to 60 mg b.i.d. three weeks ago for
unknown reasons.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient has orthopnea, PND, and lower
extremity edema.  No chest pain or diaphoresis.  No cough or
fever.  On arrival to the ER on [**2173-12-22**], the patient's blood
pressure was 128/78, heart rate was 85, and oxygen saturation
83 percent on room air and 97 percent on 1.5 liters nasal
cannula.  The patient was diuresed with a total of 300 mg
intravenous Lasix with no change in oxygenation.  She was
also started on intravenous nitro drip.  Urine output has
been about 1200 cubic centimeters over the past six hours.
Chest x-ray this a.m. is consistent with CHF.  EKG consistent
with atrial fibrillation, which was new.  The patient was
started on intravenous heparin drip.  CT was done, which was
negative for PE, though it was one minute secondary to the
patient's obesity.  Lower extremity duplexes were negative
for DVT.  The patient was switched to BiPAP after an ABG
showed a PCO2 of 77 and a PAO2 of 71 on 4 liters nasal
cannula.  A repeat echo was performed and revealed an EF of
55 percent, concentric LVH, new 1 to 2 plus MR, moderate
pulmonary artery hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.2 degrees
F., pulse 95, blood pressure 112/59, respiratory rate 21,
pulse oximetry 95 percent on BiPAP.  Examination:  In
general, the patient is obese, comfortable appearing, in no
acute distress.  HEENT:  Obese.  Neck veins difficult to
appreciate.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, no
appreciated murmur, and no S3 or S4.  Lungs:  Clear
posteriorly without wheezes or crackles.  Abdomen:  Soft,
distended, nontender, bowel sounds positive.  Extremities:  2
plus edema one-half way to the knees bilaterally.  Rectal:
Guaiac positive per ED.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratories are significant for an ABG on
[**2173-12-23**] at 10:00 a.m., which showed a pH of 7.35, a PCO2 of
61, and a PAO2 of 41 on room air.  On [**2173-12-23**] at 3:45 p.m.,
pH of 7.34, PCO2 of 71, and PAO2 of 77 on 4 liters of nasal
cannula.  An EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 90 with a
normal axis, normal QRS, QT, poor R-wave progression.  An
echo showed elongated LA, elongated RA, moderate symmetric
LVH, and EF of 55 percent.  Laboratories showed a white count
of 10.6, hematocrit of 37.7, platelets of 236,000, and
creatinine of 1.1.  CK x3 were 5 and troponin x2 less than
0.01.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and interstitial
edema.  Chest CTA showed no PE and proximal pulmonary artery
bronchus and ground-glass opacity with question of some CHF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hypoxia.  The patient was admitted to the
CCU for continued hypoxia requiring BiPAP in the ER.  The
hypoxia was thought to be secondary to the patient's
obstructive sleep apnea and pulmonary hypertension in
addition to her diastolic heart failure, which was worsened
by the patient's new atrial fibrillation.  Pulmonary
consultation was obtained.  They recommended controlling the
patient's heart rate, diuresing the patient, continuing her
BiPAPs, following with a sleep study in the future, and
avoiding hypoxemia.  The patient was diuresed while overnight
and was discharged to the floor.  She continued with CPAPs at
night and was continued to be diuresed with Lasix with some
improvement, though continued dyspnea on exertion.  On
discharge, she was able to ambulate with a cane, but was
requiring oxygen still.  It was thought that the patient
would do better once she could be cardioverted, but this
would have to be done later.  The patient was also continued
on ACE inhibitor for after-load reduction for her CHF, as
well as fluid restriction.

New atrial fibrillation.  The patient was rate controlled
with Lopressor.  She was started on a heparin drip in the ER
and also was initiated on Coumadin.  The patient was planned
for outpatient cardioversion after therapeutic INRs.
Appointments were scheduled for cardioversion after
discharge.

Hematuria. The patient had episodes of hematuria after her
Foley was discontinued while on heparin.  Her heparin drip
was turned down somewhat.  The scale was tightened, and this
resolved.  The UA and urine culture were negative.  The
patient needs this hematuria to be worked up as an
outpatient.

Hypothyroidism.  The patient is still hypothyroid by TSH;
however, she is already on Levoxyl.  We  thought that in this
initial setting, especially with atrial fibrillation, her
Levoxyl should not be increased.  TFTs will be followed after
discharge and stabilization.

Diabetes mellitus.  The patient was continued on a rising
insulin sliding scale and her 70/30 while in-house.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  Pulmonary examination on [**2174-1-26**] and
