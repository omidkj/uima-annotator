History of Present Illness:
64 y LH Persian woman. According to her sister [**Name (NI) 17**], she was in
a car at 15:15 h, and then she had a sudden onset of a left
hemiparesis and left facial droop. She was taken to [**Hospital1 34585**]. She had an MRI imaging and was found to have a M1 R MCA

17:56 h, and the time the IVtPA ended was 18:06 h. She was given
a 7 mg bolus followed by 63 mg over one hour. Ms [**Known lastname 80321**] is deaf,
and only understands sign language and her sister's Farsi. She
was confused and agitated when she was taken to the CT scanner
at 19:15 h at [**Hospital1 18**], and was intubated. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for IAtPA ([**Hospital1 17436**] device), depending on the repeat CT head
scan.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

           (Reference Range-Negative).

IMAGING:
CTA head/neck (OSH) ([**11-8**]):
1. Dimminished perfusion in the right MCA territory with cutoff
of the right MCA M1 segment.
2. Abnormal right pharyngeal tonsil with masslike appearance.
ENT consultation suggested.
3. Abnormal multinodular thyroid gland.

MRI brain (OSH) ([**11-8**]): subtle restricted diffusion in the
right basal ganglia and insula. Impression:  Right MCA territory
stroke.

CXR (OSH) ([**11-8**]): Impression:  Findings consistent with
congestive heart failure.

CT Head/CTP ([**11-8**]): IMPRESSION: Increase in mean transit time
throughout the entire territory of the right MCA. Decrease in
blood volume and blood flow within the right putamen and globus
pallidus consistent with infarct in this area.

TTE ([**11-9**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast at rest. The interatrial septum is bowed toward
the right atrium (c/w increased LA pressure). Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >60%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears str
