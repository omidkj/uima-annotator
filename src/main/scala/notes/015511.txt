Pertinent Results:
CXR: with severe pulmonary edema vs. viral PNA
.
EKG: a fib at vr of 117, std in v5-6.
.
[**5-2**] Echo : RA pressure ~ 0-5mmHg. Mild symmetric LVH. Overall
LV systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%).  Unable to fully
assess for wall motion abnl given suboptimal images. No AS, no
AR, trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] systolic hypertension. Mild-mod TR.
.
BAL [**2114-4-30**]: Negative for malignant cells
.
CXR [**2115-5-6**]:
An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position 4.1 cm above the
carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying
stomach. A right IJ central line is present, tip over distal
SVC, near SVC/aortic junction.

There are diffusely increased interstitial markings in both
lungs, which are more pronounced on the right, with confluent
opacity at the right base and small, right>left, pleural
effusions. There is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent
with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There may be
some underlying chronic lung disease. Diffuse osteopenia and
endplate scalloping is noted in the spine.

Compared with [**2115-5-4**], there has been some interval improvement
in the degree of opacity in the right lung, likely reflecting a
partial interval improvement in CHF findings.


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is an 84 yo F with a h/o CVA, HTN, rectal CA, PAF,
COPD, hypothyroidism who presented with melena, hypotension and
intubated for respiratory distress.  The following is her
hospital course by problem:
.
#) Resp distress: The patient's initial respiratory failure was
felt to be likely secondary to underlying pneumonia complicated
by hemorrhage given the patient had bloody secretions. She was
intubated on arrival into the ICU and remained so until [**2115-5-6**]
for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Bronchoscopy showed large
amount of blood in airways R lung>L lung. [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and anti-GBM
serologies were negative. BAL negative for AFB, negative for
malignant cells; BAL culture had no growth. There was also
concern for superimposed ventilator-associated pneumonia, in the
setting of fevers. She was treated with a 12 day course of
vancomycin, flagyl,and levofloxacin.  The patient's fever curve
trended down on [**5-6**] and she has remained afebrile now for over
24 hours.  Duplex of her lower extremities were obtained on [**5-6**]
in the setting of persistent fevers, however this was negative
for DVT. The patient now remains stable satting at 93-94% on 4L
NC.
.
#) Melena: The patient's history was consistent with upper GI
bleeding in the setting of a grossly elevated INR, likely due to
misdosing Coumadin for PAF. The patient received IV vitamin K,
4u PRBC and multiple units FFP with normalized INR and stable
Hct. EGD revealed old blood in stomach but no active bleed, +
gastritis.  She was continued on [**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor.
Coumadin and aggrenox were held and not restarted in the setting
of elevated INR, GI bleed, and lung bleed.
.
#) Hypotension: Through much of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course
she remained hypotensive.  This was initially concerning for
sepsis and patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, elevated
RR, high wbc. All culture data remain negative to date. Of
consideration also was hypovolemia from GIB. Patient is
normotensive now, off pressors.
.
#) Fevers: As per above, the patient had persistent fevers
despite broad spectrum antibiotics, however she has now been
afebrile for over 24 hrs.  She was treated with a 14 day course
of Vanc/Levo/Flagyl.  Duplex of the lower extremities on [**5-6**]
was negative for DVT.
.
#) Coagulopathy: Elevated INR on admission in the setting of
Coumadin use for PAF. Pt. initially received IV Vit K in the ED
with good response, but INR increased again despite
discontinuation of Coumadin. This was thought to be due to
malnutrition/antibiotics. INR is stable at 2.0.  Coumadin was
not restarted at the time of discharge.
.
#) HTN: The patient's blood pressure was low through much of her
hospitalization, but she is now normotensive.
.
#) Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had afib with HR in the
120s-140s through much of her stay.  Given lowish blood
pressure, beta blockers were held.  A digoxin load was initiated
and maintenance dose was started.  She was restarted on low dose
beta blocker prior to discharge for better rate control.  This
will need to be titrated up after discharge.  The patient was
not restarted on coumadin given the multiple complications that
she presented with in the setting of elevated INR of 22.
.
#) Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on outpatient
Synthroid
.
#) Rectal CA: s/p diversion ileostomy with radiation,
chemotherapy in [**2107**]. Pt with recent CEA elevation but refusing
further w/u. No other issues.
.
#) FEN: Regular diet
.
#) PPx: The patient has been receiving proton pump inhibitors
and pneumoboots.
.
#) Code status: Code states changed to DNR/DNI, no pressors by
brother.
