Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 14178**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admission from clinic for tachycardia.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old
African-American female with a past medical history of
hypothyroidism and hypertension who presented to her primary
care physician with new onset shortness of breath, dyspnea,
lightheadedness, and PND.  Symptoms have progressed over the
past two weeks prior to admission.  Upon presentation to her
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] showed narrow complex tachycardia
and an old known left bundle branch block.  The patient's
pulse in the office was at 128, at which point, the patient
was referred to the Emergency Department.  Of note, the
patient does not have any cardiac history.  She was 100%
functional without experiencing shortness of breath prior to
this episode.

In the Emergency Department, a CTA ruled out a pulmonary
embolism.  The patient was given IV Lasix and 12.5 mg
Lopressor empirically for CHF.  A chest x-ray revealed
basilar congestion and atelectasis but no evidence of CHF.
The patient developed bradycardia with a pulse of 35 and
hypotension with a blood pressure of 60-40 after having
received the Lopressor.  The patient was fluid resuscitated
and the blood pressure was raised to 120.  The patient again
became tachycardiac with a pulse of 120 and was admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] and scheduled for EP.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroidism.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Remote GI bleed.
4.  Breast biopsy in [**2112**].
5.  Knee surgery in [**2115**].
6.  Hip surgery in [**2121**].

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.o.d.
2.  Levothyroxine 100 micrograms q.d.
3.  Hydrocortisone 2.5% twice as needed to scalp.
4.  Triamcinolone.
5.  Acetamide 0.1% twice as needed.
6.  Tylenol p.r.n. pain.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  History of diabetes mellitus in mother and
hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with a roommate.  She has
a remote history of smoking one to two cigarettes a day for
approximately 20 years.  The patient admits to quitting 15
years ago.  The patient denied alcohol use, denied any other
drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
was afebrile, blood pressure 124/81, heart rate 140s,
respiratory rate 12.  The 02 saturation was 97% on room air.
HEENT:  No JVD noted, no scleral icterus.  Mucosa moist.
Cardiovascular:  Distant heart sounds, tachycardiac, S1 and
S2 present, I/VI holosystolic murmur.  Respiratory:  Positive
bibasilar crackles, worse on the right, diffuse wheezing.
Abdomen:  Tender in the epigastric region, otherwise
nondistended, soft, bowel sounds present.  Extremities:
There were +2 pedal pulses, no edema noted.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Hemoglobin 13.1, hematocrit
37.8, white blood cells 8.2, and platelets 176,000.
Electrolytes:  Sodium 140, potassium 3.2, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 24, BUN 10, and creatinine 1.1, sugar 104.  CKs
were 136, MB 3, and troponin 0.01.  Enzymes were continued to
be cycled and the patient was ruled out for acute MI.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on the floor, the
patient developed torsades which was attributed to treatment
with beta blockade in the ED and resultant prolongation of
QRS on the background of bradycardia.  The patient was
transferred to the CCU where she was given 2 mg of magnesium
sulfate and converted to sinus.  The next morning, [**2123-8-11**], the patient underwent EP study with RFA radiofrequency
ablation and dual-chamber pacemaker placement.  This RFA
addressed her supraventricular tachycardia.  The pacemaker
addressed her bradycardia.

Post EP study and pacemaker insertion on the floor, the
patient developed tachypnea and diaphoresis with a rising
blood pressure to 208/119, pulse 120, and SA02 of 90% on 2
liters.  Chest x-ray done at that time showed evidence of
congestion and the patient was given 40 mg of IV Lasix.
Echocardiogram also performed at this time showed severe MR
[**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 14179**] left ventricular [**Last Name (Titles) 14179**] LV and EF of
30%.  The next morning, [**2123-8-12**], the patient underwent
a catheterization which showed 100% RCA ostium occlusion and
otherwise patent LAD and circumflex.

A stent was placed in the RCA.  Mitral regurgitation was
assessed as moderate by left ventriculogram.  Post
catheterization, the patient continued to be in congestion
with significant pleural effusion.  The CHF Service, under
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], were also on consult following the patient.  The
patient was started on Nisiritide on [**2123-8-15**] and was
continued on Nisiritide with successful diuresis until
[**2123-8-20**].  Throughout the course, the patient received
Captopril for afterload reduction and beta blockade.

The patient improved significantly and is able to ambulate
with PT.  The patient is on room air and saturating at 97%
oxygen.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital6 14180**].

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2.  Mitral regurgitation
3.  Acute congestive heart failure due to number two.
4.  Supraventricular tachycardia.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypothyroidism.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:
1.  Follow-up with cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**], in one week,
phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 902**].
2.  Follow-up with outpatient echocardiogram on [**2123-9-3**] at 11:00 [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
3.  Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8499**], primary care physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] three weeks.

POSTDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Levothyroxine 125 micrograms p.o. q.d.
9.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Acetaminophen 325 mg tablets, p.r.n.
11. Albuterol sulfate solution p.r.n. for wheezing.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.
