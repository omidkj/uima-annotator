Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension and fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement [**2124-6-29**]

History of Present Illness:
72 F resident of [**Location 105502**] with multiple medical problems including
DM type II, dCHF, PVD, a.fib (on coumadin), and ICU admissions
for sepsis in past who was noted to be lethargic on AM of [**6-21**].
There, pt's blood pressure was 80's systolic, rectal temp 103 F,
HR in 100s. [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD there was no obvious source of infection
and sent to ED. Pt does not recall transfer to ED.
In ED, she was noted to have SBP in 90's, HR in 100's in A fib,
and CXR with chronic RLL opacity. She had a temp of 103.4. She
was given 4 L of fluids with heart rate in 80's and improvement
in her SBP to 120's. Femerol line attempted without success in
ED. UA was positive but not a clean sample. CXR showed diffuse
right sided infiltrates consistent with history of fibrosis. She
was given Levofloxacin 500mg IV, Vancomycin 1gram IV, Flagyl
500mg IV. She had urine output of 1 L and resolution of delta
MS.
Of note, pt was admitted to ICU on [**10-10**] from HebReb with
similar symptoms and treated for sepsis [**3-9**] nosocomial
pneumonia. She was treated with 2 weeks of vancomycin/imipenem.

Currently she is complaining of right leg pain which is old,
starting in stump but then radiating to phantom leg, [**7-15**] from
[**2128-4-10**] baseline. She denies diarrhea, chest pain, SOB, cough,
dysuria. She complains of abdominal pain worst in RUQ but only
with exam. No rash.

Pertinent Results:
[**2124-6-21**] CT abd/pelvis: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The
visualized portions of the lung bases demonstrate small
bilateral pleural effusions and interstitial opacities
consistent with CHF. There is a 9-mm vague hypodensity of the
left hepatic lobe, which has not significantly changed compared
to [**2123-8-6**] and is too small to definitively characterize.
Otherwise, the liver is unremarkable. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy. The pancreas is atrophic. There is a 1.5-cm
hypodense lesion at the anterior margin of the spleen which is
unchanged. There is cortical thinning of the left kidney which
is chronic. The right kidney and adrenal glands are
unremarkable. Again seen is diastasis of the anterior abdominal
wall with protrusion of transverse colon. Otherwise, the bowels
are unremarkable and there is no evidence of obstruction or free
intra-abdominal air. There are extensive abdominal aortic
calcifications. No intra-abdominal fluid collection or abscess
is identified. There is no pathologic mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter
within the urinary bladder which is decompressed. The rectum,
uterus, adnexa, and intrapelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable.
There is no free pelvic fluid or lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: The patient is status post right hip arthroplasty.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions and interstitial opacity of
the lung bases consistent with CHF.
2. Vague 9-mm hypodensity of the left hepatic lobe is too small
to be definitively characterized but unchanged from [**2123-8-6**].
3. Atrophic pancreas.
4. Chronic left renal cortical thinning.
5. Diastasis of the abdominal wall with protrusion of transverse
colon but no evidence of obstruction.
6. Extensive abdominal arterial calcifications.
7. No change in 1.5-cm hypodensity of the spleen.

[**2124-6-22**] CXR Pa/La: FINDINGS: There is worsening congestive
failure, with increased pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion and a left
pleural effusion. Right lower lobe opacity also appears somewhat
more dense. Lung volumes are reduced. Osseous structures are
diffusely demineralized with degenerative changes in the
thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION: Worsening congestive failure. Right lower lobe
pneumonia. Tiny left pleural effusion.
.
CT chest: FINDINGS: Diffuse bilateral hazy ground-glass opacity
is seen within both lungs, new since the most recent
examination. Interlobular septal thickening is also present.
There are new bilateral pleural effusions. Also new is a patchy
opacity in the right middle lobe. Findings of traction
bronchiectasis at the bases, and central and peripheral fibrosis
with architectural distortion are unchanged. There are dependent
secretions in the trachea. The bronchi are patent to the
segmental level.

Right paratracheal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 1.5 cm in
short axis and other smaller mediastinal lymph nodes are
unchanged. There is no pericardial effusion. Coronary
calcifications are present. The heart and pericardium are
otherwise stable in appearance.

Patient is post-cholecystectomy. Dense arteriosclerotic
calcifications are seen within the aorta and splenic artery in
the upper abdomen. Density of the liver appears decreased
compared to the prior study from [**2123-4-5**], and is now
within normal limits. Small hiatal hernia. Degenerative changes
are seen throughout the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:

1. New bilateral effusions and diffuse ground-glass
opacification with septal thickening most likely indicates
congestive failure.

2. Patchy opacity in the right middle lobe probably represents a
superimposed infectious process.

3. Largely unchanged appearance of architectural distortion and
fibrosis in the middle and lower lobes and traction
bronchiectasis most predominantly in the lower lobes. Unchanged
lymphadenopathy.

4. Coronary calcifications.
.
CT head: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage,
shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
Age-related brain atrophy is seen. Hypodensity is seen in the
cerebral periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic
small vessel infarction, unchanged from the prior exam. [**Doctor Last Name **]-
white matter differentiation is preserved. The mastoid air cells
are clear. Minimal mucosal thickening is seen within the left
ethmoid air cells and the sphenoid sinus, which has developed
since the prior study. Also, the nasopharyngeal soft tissues are
