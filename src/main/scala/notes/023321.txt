CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

FINDINGS:

There is no disc, vertebral, or paraspinal abnormality
identified. There is no sign of fracture or abnormal alignment.
Please note CT is not able to provide intrathecal detail
comparable to MRI. The visualized outline of the thecal sac
appears unremarkable.

Please note there is mild narrowing of the C4/5 intervertebral
disc space with the appearance suggesting this may be congenital
in etiology, v. isolated degenerative disease.

Incompletely visualized lung fields reveal a possible tiny left
apical tiny pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No acute abnormality of the cervical spine on CT.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: History did not specify the location of any visible
trauma, including whether the patient fell on his head. Upon
further questioning, the point of impact was the back.

FINDINGS: There is no visible intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures, minor or major
vascular territorial infarction. The density values of the brain
parenchyma are within normal limits. The surrounding osseous and
soft tissue structures also appear unremarkable.

CONCLUSION: No definite signs of extra or intracranial
post-traumatic pathology. We have placed a note on the emergency
room dashboard for you to contact this office to discuss this
case, regarding its clinical findings, in detail. A subsequent
conversation by telephone provided the additional history needed
(i.e. point of impact).

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple splenic lacerations with intraparenchymal hematoma
and hemoperitoneum in the upper abdomen, left greater than
right.

2. Mild pulmonary ground-glass opacities mostly on the left,
compatible with pulmonary contusion without evidence of
hemothorax or pneumothorax. 6-mm lung nodule in the left upper
lobe, probably related to trauma. However, follow up is
recommended.

3. Left 9th posterior non-displaced rib fracture and L1-L4 left
transverse process fracture.

4. Well-corticated defect along the left acetabular roof likely
congenital or disequilibrium prior trauma.

Please note that this scan was obtained on delayed phase, which
limits evaluation for solid organ injury.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery/Spine was
consulted because of the spine fractures; these were
nonoperative. Pain control was initially an issue, he was on PCA
Dilaudid and later switched to oral Dilaudid which has been
helpful. Serial abdominal exams and hematocrits were followed
given his splenic injury; this was also non operative. His Hct
remained stable at 29.1. He continued to have posterior cervical
pain despite negative CT spine imaging; flexion/extension films
were obtained and were negative for any fracture.

Physical therapy was consulted and he has been cleared for
discharge home.

Social work was consulted for emotional support.
