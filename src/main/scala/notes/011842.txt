CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Small bowel obstruction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old female
who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with nausea, vomiting and chest
and back pain for one day.  She had no abdominal pain, no
diarrhea, no constipation.  Her last bowel movement was prior

denies any fevers, but reports that she has had chills and
sweats, and also denies any abdominal pain.  These symptoms
all started on the day prior to admission.  Her pain is
actually now relieved, but her nausea remains.  Her last meal
was this morning, and she vomited about 3:00 pm, prior to
coming to the ED.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Gastroesophageal reflux and hiatal hernia.  An EGD and
colonoscopy in [**2109**] were normal.
2. Iron deficiency anemia.
3. Recurrent UTIs.
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

PRIOR SURGICAL HISTORY:  Appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Zantac.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Prevacid.
2. Metamucil.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She does not drink.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is afebrile with pulse 71, blood pressure
145/71, respiratory rate 24, O2 sat 92% on room air.
GENERAL:  In no acute distress, alert and oriented x 3.
HEAD AND NECK:  Anicteric.  No cervical lymphadenopathy.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Obese.  Soft abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds,
nondistended.  She does have some tenderness in the right
side of the abdomen, and some tenderness associated with her
prior appendectomy scar.
RECTAL EXAM:  Guaiac negative with no masses and no stool in
the rectal vault.
LOWER EXTREMITIES:  Warm, well-perfused.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White count 7.8, hematocrit
34.1, platelets 234.  Coags within normal limits.  CK-MB and
cardiac enzymes were negative.  She had a sodium of 149,
potassium 3.1, chloride 119, bicarb 22, BUN 15, creatinine
0.3, lactate 1.4.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed a right-sided pleural effusion with a
large hiatal hernia with no obvious free air.
ABDOMINAL X-RAY:  Although it did not show any dilated loops,
it did show significant paucity of air distally.
CAT SCAN ABDOMEN:  Showed a diagnosis of a small bowel
obstruction, dilated loops of small bowel, the proximal
jejunum in the left upper quadrant with an associated
transition point.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Because of the findings of a small bowel
obstruction, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the general surgery
purple service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She was made
NPO, given IV fluids, and had an NG tube, and Foley catheter
placed.  The rest of her hospital course can be discussed in
an organ system based fashion.  The major problems were
cardiovascular, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal.

1) CARDIOVASCULAR:  On hospital day #2, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had an
episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.  Intravenous Lopressor
was not able to convert her, and neither was diltiazem.
However, the AFIB did respond to amiodarone.  She was placed
on an amiodarone drip which she tolerated well, and
cardiology was consulted, and they followed her for the rest
of her admission.  Gradually, the amiodarone was converted
over to PO, and she was sent home on PO amiodarone.
Follow-up pulmonary function tests were scheduled as an
outpatient as a baseline to check for pulmonary sequelae to
chronic amiodarone dosing.

On hospital day #4, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the ICU
for decreased respiratory status.  A STAT echocardiogram was
obtained which revealed 2+ aortic insufficiency.  Because of
this new onset of atrial fibrillation, she was anticoagulated
with Coumadin.  This was started on [**3-9**], prior to her
discharge.

2) RESPIRATORY:  As mentioned above, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had an
episode of poor sats and just general respiratory
instability.  She was transferred to the ICU for closer care.
At this time, a right IJ central line was attempted, but the
patient could not tolerate it, and a left subclavian line was
attempted.  However, as a complication to this line, the
patient developed a left pneumothorax.  A pigtail catheter
was placed with good result, and the pneumothorax was
relieved.  That occurred on [**3-6**].  On [**3-8**], the
chest tube was placed to water-seal and was subsequently
discontinued without any difficulties.

3) GI:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with a small bowel obstruction
with a transition point.  This was managed conservatively
with NG tube decompression and intravenous fluids.  She
eventually opened up, and on hospital day #3 she passed
flatus.  During all the excitement with her being transferred
to the unit and having the pneumothorax, PO food was not
started until [**3-8**].  This was started with sips and
was slowly advanced to a low-residual diet without nausea,
vomiting or abdominal pain.  Therefore, on [**2112-3-10**],
hospital day #9, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was discharged to home in good
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Small bowel obstruction.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3. Rapid atrial fibrillation.
4. Aortic insufficiency.
5. Pleural effusion.
6. Pneumothorax.
7. Gastroesophageal reflux.
8. Hiatal hernia.
9. Iron deficiency anemia.
10.Colonic polyps.

FOLLOW-UP:
1. She will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary
cardiologist, who has agreed to follow her Coumadin levels.
She is going to get her INR checked on Tuesday, [**3-15**],
at Dr.[**Name (NI) 5765**] after receiving 5 days of low dose Coumadin,
and on the 18 she has a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
2. She is also recommended to contact Dr.[**Name (NI) 1482**] office
to follow-up in about 2 weeks.
3. She is also scheduled for a pulmonary function tests in
the next 2 weeks, and she can schedule an outpatient
appointment with the nutrition team to discuss her
low-residue diet as needed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg po qd.
2. Hydralazine 25 mg po q 6.
3. Albuterol inhaler 1-2 puffs q 6 h prn shortness of breath
or wheezing.
4. Protonix 1 tablet po qd, or
5. If she wants she can also take Prevacid 1 tablet po qd.
6. Coumadin--Her dosing schedule as discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
