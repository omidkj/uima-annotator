History of Present Illness:
55yo man with h/o CAD s/p PTCA, HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, morbid
obesity and tobacco habit who p/t OSH on [**9-18**] w/CP and
diaphoresis. Pt thought was GERD since "burning" in neck
extending down throat to and across chest. No chest pressure,
n/v, or radiations.

At OSH, pt r/o for MI by serial CE, with peak CK 220, MB 4.2,
TropI 1.18. He was sent for stress test, though these results
are not in the record. Because of recurrent episodes of CP with
inferolateral ST depressions and HTN (and presumably the results
of the stress test), he was was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
Of note, pt was started on IV steroids for presumed COPD flare
prior to ETT and levaquin for bronchitis; however, pt denies
cough, f/c, wheezing in recent past.

Pt's EKG at OSH: NSR@86, nl axis, nl intervals, 1-2mm ST
depressions in V5-V6; no Q waves

Cath [**9-20**]: 70% mid LAD, subtotally occluded Lcx w/ slow flow,
distal 80-90% RCA stenoses; per V-gram EF 50%, no MR

Pt was then transferred to CCU with IABP in place until he can
have CABG.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 54yo man with known CAD, DM2, HTN, hyperlipid, morbid
obesity, with burning CP likely representative of unstable
angina, cath showing 3VD.

1. Cardio
A. Coronaries: patient arrived in CCU CP free on IABP. The plan
initially was to cont the IABP and heparin until the patient
could have a CABG. However, CT [**Doctor First Name **] upon further eval felt that
the patient's obesity and DM made him a high risk surgical
candidate.  Therefore, the patient went back to the cath lab on
[**9-23**] where he had his LCx and LAD stented, and is planned to
have his RCA stented after an interval of [**1-3**] weeks to avoid
dye-related ATN.  In the meantime the pt was maintained on [**Date Range **],
BB, ACEI, statin, Plavix.

Of note, the patient had an episode of "burning" in his throat
after his stents were placed, an EKG showed V5-V6 1mm ST
elevations, CK 118, CK-MB 3, Trop .09. Pt was started on
Nitroglycerine drip and then PO Imdur with weaning off of drip.
He had no more CP or burning during the course of his admission.

B. Pump HTN: above mgmt

C. Rhythm: NSR

2. Pulm: COPD - suggested on OSH CXR; cont MDIs, tapered off the
steroids that the pt had been started on at the OSH; since there
was no evidence of bronchitis at admission, abx were held

3. Renal: Cr 1.2 on admit, 1.9 s/p cath, then back to 1.2 prior
to discharge; gave mucomyst and hydration for second cath

4. ID: no evid of bronchitis or other infection at this time;
will monitor

5. GI: bowel regimen; heart healthy, low fat, low salt diet

6. GU: in prep for possible CT surgery, a foley cath insertion
was attempted; after two nurses and a CCU doctor tried without
success [**2-3**] BPH, GU was called. After they failed to pass a
Foley, they inserted a suprapubic cath in the patient's midline
lower abd.  The patient bleed from the site, possibly related to
his anticoagulated status given his CAD. The pt's hct dropped
during this time as well from 39 to 32 to 27. He was given 1
unit of PRBCs, bumped to only 28, and an abd CT was performed
that showed a large hematoma in the rectus muscle. The pt's hct
stablized however and evetually rose to 32.7 prior to his d/c.
Per GU, the pt was instructed to leave the SPT in and follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpt in 2 weeks (after RCA stent placed)
to have it removed. They did not want to remove it in this
hospitalization given the risk for disrupting hemostasis that
had been acheived with it remaining in place. The patient was
able to void through his urethra through his hosp course.

7. Heme: see above

8. Endo DM: [**Doctor First Name **] diet, SSI; pt to be d/c'd with metformin 500mg
po qd
