CONTINUATION:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital 5871**]
Hospital for cardiac catheterization. Please see previous
dictation for history of present illness and past medical
history. The patient was treated by the medical service for
several days and on [**4-25**] was brought to the Cardiac Cath
Lab which revealed severe LV dysfunction with moderate to
severe pulmonary hypertension. The left main had a 60 percent
ostial lesion, LAD with a mid 80 percent lesion, diagonal
with a mid to distal 80-90 percent with septal collaterals,
circumflex with 80-90 percent stenosis of OM1, RCA with a
proximal 60 percent lesion and an ostial 90 percent lesion
and diffuse disease throughout the RCA. No LV gram was done
due to elevated filling pressure. Following cardiac
catheterization, CT Surgery was consulted. Following
consultation with Cardiac Surgery, the patient was scheduled
for a viability study and scan to determine if the patient
was an operative candidate. This study showed viability of
the myocardium within the LAD distribution as well as the
PDA. The patient was ultimately scheduled for coronary artery
bypass grafting. However, prior to his operative date, the
patient returned to the Cath Lab and an intraaortic balloon
pump was placed.

On [**4-28**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room at
which time he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times
three. Please see the OR report for full details. In summary,
the patient had a CABG times three with a LIMA to the LAD,
saphenous vein graft to the PDA, saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal. He tolerated the operation and was transferred from
the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer, the patient was in an AV paced
rhythm at 95 beats per minute with a mean arterial pressure
of 90, CVP of 11 and a PAD of 21. He had dobutamine 5
mcg/kg/min and Levophed at 0.1 mcg/kg/min as well as propofol
at 20 mcg/kg/min. The patient did well in the immediate
postoperative period. His anesthesia was reversed. He was
ventilated and successfully weaned and was ultimately
extubated. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the
remainder of his operative day. On postoperative Day 1, the
patient continued to be hemodynamically stable. His
intraaortic balloon pump was weaned and ultimately removed.
Following removal of his balloon pump, his dobutamine
infusion was weaned. On postoperative day 2, the patient was
noted to have increasing abdominal distention and an elevated
white blood cell count. General Surgery was consulted at that
time to assess for ischemia of bowel or the GI tract. It was
felt that the abdominal distention was an ileus and the
patient was followed by General Surgery Service for the next
several days. The patient was also seen by the
Electrophysiology Service who interrogated his pacemaker.
Throughout this period, he remained hemodynamically stable.
By postoperative Day 4, the patient's vasoactive IV drips
were weaned to off. His bowel function seemed to have
returned. He was started on sips and advanced to clears which
he tolerated well and his white blood cell count began to
trend down. The patient spent several additional days in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit while he was
anticoagulated and his diet was advanced. Ultimately, on
postoperative Day 7, he was transferred to the floor. Once on
the floor, with the assistance of the nursing staff and
Physical Therapy, the patient's activity level was gradually
advanced. He continued his Coumadin load and had an otherwise
uneventful hospital course. On postoperative Day 13, it was
decided that the patient was stable and ready to be
transferred to Rehabilitation.

At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical exam is
as follows. Vital signs - temperature 98, heart rate 69
paced, blood pressure 115/69, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 96
percent on room air. On physical examination, he is in no
acute distress. Neurologic - alert and oriented times three,
moves all extremities and follows commands. Cardiovascular -
irregular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2. Sternum is stable and
incision with staples open to air, clean and dry. Respiratory
- clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft and
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well-perfused with 1-2 plus edema
bilaterally. The left lower extremity incision with Steri-
Strips, open to air, clean and dry.
