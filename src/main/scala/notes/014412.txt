History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 51 yo man w/ no PMH but does not see doctors, presented
to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital on [**2103-3-8**] w/ c/o CP, SOB. Pt
states he has been having SOB symptoms over the past week, which
he describes as DOE, for example when walking in the cold, or
walking up stairs. This has been relieved by rest. He also has
some orthopnea, as he notes SOB is worse with lying flat, and
he's been sleeping on 2 pillows at night. He attributed these
symptoms to a cold, as he was having some sinus drainage over
this time. Then, night of admission, pt states that he was lying
down resting before work when he developed some SSCP, which he
describes as pressure, moderate ([**5-10**]), no radiation, no
associated N/V, diaphoresis. Otherwise denies any f/c, change in
bowel or bladder habits, LE edema, any other complaints. He
therefore went to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital ED.
At OSH, pt was noted to be hypertensive w/ SBP 162. EKG
demonstrated LBBB (unknown duration, as pt w/ no PCP f/u). Labs
notable for r/i MI with Trop I mildly elevated at 1.5, MB 24, CK
600. Pt was given ASA, plavix, labetalol, nitropaste, started on
hep gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for admission for cath. Pt
was CP free on transfer.
In [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile, SBP 190, other VSS. Labs drawn =
pending. Pt was given lopressor 5mg IV x 1, and started on NTG
gtt, hep gtt, and integrillin gtt.
Currently pt CP free, no other symptoms.

Pertinent Results:
[**2103-3-9**] - Cardiac Cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
normal. The
LAD had80% stenosis after D1, 70% stenosis after D2; and a 60%
proximal
D1 stenosis. The LCX had 90% proximal stenosis and there is a
long mid
disease to 90%. The RCA had 80% mid vessel stenosis asnd 70%
stenosis
before bifurcation and ostium of PDA. A ramus artery  was small
and had
70% ostial lesion.
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure was 12mmHg and RVEDP
was
20mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were elevated measuring
52/28mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean
PCW
pressure was 28mmHg and LVEDP was 33mmHg). The systemic arterial

pressures were elevated measuring 160/94mmHg. There was no
significant
gradient across the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter
from the
left ventricle to the ascending aorta. The cardiac index was
mildly
depressed measuring 2.2l/min/m2.
3. Contrast ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of
35% with
global hypokinesis. There was no mitral regurgitation noted.

[**2103-3-9**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2103-3-19**] CXR
Stable small bilateral pleural effusions; improving areas of
atelectasis, and resolution of loculated component of pleural
effusion in the left upper hemithorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
A Cardiac catheterization on [**2103-3-9**] revealed three vessel
disease and moderately severe LV dysfunction. Cardiac surgery
was consulted. Preop workup included echocardiogram and normal
carotid u/s. He was diuresed for his SOB and systolic CHF and
awaited plavix washout prior to surgery. He was taken to the
operating room on [**2103-3-13**] where he underwent a four vessel
coronary artery bypass grafting. He was transferred to the CSRU
in critical but stable condition on epi, neo and propofol. He
was extubated and weaned from his vasoactive drips later that
same day. He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
one for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes service was consulted
for assistance with his diabetes medication management. He
worked with the physical therapy service daily for assistance
with his postoperative strength and mobility. He was  transfused
with red blood cells for postoperative anemia. Mild sternal
drainage was noted and followed closely. Cultures of the
drainage were negative. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day 7. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient.
