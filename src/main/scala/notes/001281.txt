History of Present Illness:
45 yo M h/o ulcerative colitis s/p colectomy with ileoanal
renastamosis, HCM (EF-75%, resting gradient of 130mmHg),
presenting with BRBPR. The patient noticed dark stools 3 days
prior to admission and his frequency increased from his normal
of [**4-26**] per day to 5-6 per day and were beginning to have small
amounts of bright red blood. The morning prior to admission, his
stools became bright red and increased in frequency to 7 stools.
He is unable to quantify the amount.

He was notably hospitalized for GI bleed in [**Month (only) 205**] for five days.
He initally presented with a Hct of 22 and received 6 units of
prbcs and 2 units of ffp during hospital stay. Two CTAs, EGD,
and a push enteroscopy at that time revealed no source of
bleeding. The bleeding eventually resolved on its own and was
thought to be secondary to NSAID-induced ulcers somewhere in the
small bowel or perhaps had begun to heal by the time he was
imaged. His Mct on discharge was 32.

He underwent capsule endoscopy after admission that revealed
focal areas of erythema in the mid jejunum and ileum. However,
no active bleeding site was identified. His last Hct prior to
this admission was 39.5 on [**9-9**].

In the ED, initial VS: 98.7 95 145/84 20 100% RA. Rectal exam
showed [**Month/Year (2) **] blood and he notably had general pallor. Labs were
notable for a 12.5 point Hct drop (27 from 39.5) NG lavage was
negative. He was transfused 2 units of prbcs and received 40 mg
IV protonix. GI was consulted and since NG lavage was negative,
did not feel the need to scope immediately. EKG: LVH, q waves;
general palor. He has 2 PIVs (16G and 18G). Last vitals prior to
transfer: 131/79 76 13 100% RA.

Upon arrival to the ICU, patient feels well and denies
lightheadedness, sob, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain.
