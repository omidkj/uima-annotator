HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year-old
white female with an extensive past medical history including
interstitial lung disease, breast cancer, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea and congestive
heart failure who presents with complaints of shortness of
breath and dyspnea on exertion times two days.  The patient
states that she was experiencing her baseline status of
dyspnea on exertion until two days prior to admission she
noticed an acute exacerbation.  The patient also experienced
chills, but denies any frank fevers, sweats, chest pain,
sputum, cough, myalgias or chronic change in her orthopnea,
pedal edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  Due to persistent
symptoms the patient presented to the Emergency Department
where she was found to have a room air sat in the 80s,
systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient was fluid
resuscitated with 3 liters intravenous fluid, but persisted
to have systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  A left
subclavian line was placed and Dopamine was started.  The
patient was given one dose of Levofloxacin.  O2 saturation of
100% on 100% nonrebreather in the Emergency Department.  The
patient otherwise denies any symptoms of changes in weight,
decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria.  The
patient reports some sinus congestion.  The patient denies
any changes in vision, abdominal pain, numbness, tingling or
weakness.

The patient was last admitted in [**2188-6-21**] for shortness
of breath.  A BAL was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**], which was
unremarkable for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] or organisms.  The patient was felt
to be in congestive heart failure and was diuresed.

reports occasional alcohol use.  The patient is married and
lives with her husband.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no significant contributing family
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.2.  Heart
rate 98.  Blood pressure 109/45.  Respirations 29.  The
patient had a saturation of 99% on 100% nonrebreather.  In
general the patient was lying in bed and was plethoric and in
mild respiratory distress.  HEENT examination was within
normal limits.  Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and
S2.  The patient is tachycardic.  Pulmonary examination
revealed diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes
associated with crackles.  Abdominal examination was benign.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  The
patient was guaiac negative per the Emergency Department.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 10.3, hematocrit 26.3
platelets of 306, 92% neutrophils, 6% lymphocytes, 6% bands
and 2% monocytes.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 136, potassium
6, which is hemolyzed, chloride of 96, bicarb of 25, BUN 35,
creatinine 2.7, elevated from the patient's baseline of 1.4,
glucose of 76 and a CK of 243 with admission CKMB and
troponin not recorded.  Urinalysis revealed rare bacteria.
Chest x-ray revealed diffuse air space disease with relative
sparing of the left base.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 60 year-old woman with an
extensive past medical history presenting with hypoxemia,
cough, hypotension, acute renal failure.  The patient was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer
monitoring.  In the Emergency Department the patient was
given Levofloxacin and the patient also was started on
Vancomycin broad spectrum antibiotics given the likelihood of
an infectious etiology at the time of admission.  Upon
admission to the MICU the patient was also given Vancomycin,
Ceptaz and Cipro.  The patient was also continued on
admission on a Dopamine drip.  The patient was also
transfused packed red blood cells.  Attempts at a right A
line was placed upon admission to the unit, however, an A
line was not able to be ascertained.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hypoxia:  Upon admission it was thought
that the patient's hypoxia was secondary to a multilobar
pneumonia.  However, with improving status and complicated
pulmonary history it was felt by the Pulmonary Service that
her this recent decompensation was not necessarily due to
that of an infectious process, but more likely a combination
of her asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease and
perhaps a congestive heart failure.  It was felt that her
examination was more consistent of a flare of her airway
disease then a pneumonia given lack of fever or production of
sputum.  Of note the patient also has had multiple
exacerbations in the past that have been diagnosed and
treated as pneumonia, but for which her outpatient
pulmonologist had felt otherwise.  It was felt unlikely in
addition to lack of fever and sputum production that she was
also currently being treated on Levofloxacin for sinusitis
and the development of a community acquired pneumonia would
be unlikely.  Given this history and negative culture data
including sputum, Legionella and blood cultures, antibiotic
therapy except for Bactrim was discontinued prior to
discharge.  The patient was also gradually tapered on her
steroids.  The patient had a dramatic improvement in her
oxygen saturation throughout this admission.  At the time of
discharge the patient's oxygenation still remained below her
baseline as she was at 83% on room air and 95% on 2 liters
nasal cannula.  Chest x-ray on the day prior to discharge
revealed resolution of patchy multifocal air space
consolidations leaving a background of diffuse interstitial
markings.  Given the patient's clinical improvement and
extensive pulmonary history and the patient's unwillingness
to go to an in house pulmonary rehabilitation center the
patient was discharged to home with VNA for chest physical
therapy.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**].
The patient was also continued on Prednisone therapy and
Bactrim.

2.  Hypotension:  The patient was continued on a Dopamine
drip at the time of admission.  Dopamine was discontinued
within two days of admission.  The patient also was fluid
resuscitated with intravenous fluids and packed red blood
cells.  The patient's blood pressure remained stable
throughout the remainder of the hospital stay.

3.  Congestive heart failure:  Given the patient's history of
congestive heart failure she underwent a TTE that revealed a
normal EF with a decreased E to A ratio suggestive of a
diastolic dysfunction.  The patient was reinitiated on her
Lasix therapy with resolution of her hypotension.  The
patient was continued on Lasix therapy at the time of
discharge though regimen was decreased to 40 mg po q.d. in
the setting of recent hypotension.  Of note the patient also
had cardiac enzymes cycled and remained negative for any sign
of ischem
