Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness after elective pulmonary vein isolation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
transesophageal echocardiography
pulmonary vein isolation
thrombolysis

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old female with idiopathic atrial
fibrilation several vascular risk factors including diabetes and
hypertension who was admitted today for elective pulmonary vein
isolation.  Approximately 2 hours following the procedure she
developed sudden onset right sided weakness and numbness.  Neuro
exam was pertinent for right sided numbness, weakness and right
hemianopsia.  A stat stroke consult was called and [**Known lastname **]
recommended stat head CT.  Head CT showed possible loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation in the distribution of L MCA.  CTA
did not seem to show a definite clot in left main stem MCA but
on coronal section decreased flow in M3 and M4 on left side.
CTP showed a possible area of decreased blood volume in the left
MCA.  She was given tPA, bolus dose of 9mg followed by infusion
of 81mg.  Within the first hour of receiving tPA she began to
have increased movement in her right arm and right foot.  Right
hemianopsia persisted.  She was transferred to the CCU for
overnight monitoring.
.
In terms of her atrial fibrillation, she was referred for the
procedure because she failed propafenone and sotalol.  She was
last
cardioverted in [**Month (only) 1096**] while on Sotalol 80 [**Hospital1 **] and reverted
back to atrial fibrillation within minutes of getting shocked.
Since [**Month (only) 1096**] she has been in atrial fibrillation.  She reports
a rapid heart beat and shortness of breath with exertion.  Prior
to her procedure she had taken subcutaneous Lovenox after
stopping warfarin.  In addition, a TEE performed just prior to
her procedure showed no evidence of left atrial clot.  She also
received therapeutic IV heparin throughout the period of left
atrial access during her atrial fibrillation ablation procedure.
.
On review of symptoms, she reports post procedural substernal
discomfort without radiation; chronic lower back pain; diffuse
achy belly pain.  Of note she has a long standing history of low
back pain and history of irritable bowel syndrome.  She has no
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors.  All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
She does have frequent "shooting" chest pain which comes and
goes and is not related to exertion.  It resolves on its on.
She also notes dyspnea on minimal exertion, especially with
climbing stairs.  She currently has no chest pain or shortness
of breath.  She denies any current paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.  Please note pt
was admitted in [**Month (only) 321**] for the cardiac compaints and was rule
dout for MI and had cath with clean coronaries.

Social History:
The patient works as [**Hospital3 **] director.  She is not
working presently.  She denies any nicotine abuse, alcohol
abuse, or illicit drug use.  She is married, has two
children.

Family History:

Pertinent Results:
CT brain perfusion [**2-8**]

HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass
effect, or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in
caliber and configuration. There is no fracture.

HEAD AND NECK CTA: The right vertebral artery is diminutive, but
patent, and ends in a PICA termination. There is mild
atherosclerotic plaque in the bilateral carotid artery
bifurcations, but the distal cervical internal carotid arteries
are normal according to NASCET criteria bilaterally. There is no
evidence of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.

CT PERFUSION: The perfusion map appear normal, with no evidence
of delayed transit time, reduced blood flow or blood volume.

IMPRESSION: No CT or CT perfusion evidence of brain ischemia.
However, please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is
more sensitive especially for the detection of small areas of
brain ischemia
TEE [**2-8**]

The left atrium is normal in size. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the right atrial appendage. No thrombus is
seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 46 cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus seen. Mild spontaneous
biatrial echo contrast.
MRI [**2-9**]

ROUTINE MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT GADOLINIUM. ROUTINE MRA OF THE
CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] USING 3D TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUE.

Comparison is made with CT perfusion performed one day prior.

On the diffusion-weighted images, there are three punctate foci
of slow diffusion, two in the left motor cortex and one in the
right parietal subcortical white matter.

There are associated very subtle hyperintensities on FLAIR
images.

MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates patency of the anter
