Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with angioplasty and stenting


History of Present Illness:
74 yo male with past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease s/p MI and CABG in [**2103**] (at [**Hospital1 336**]), hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse presents to CCU for aspirin
desensitization in preparation for cardiac catheterization.
.
Patient began having chest pressure while eating breakfast
approximately 5am on [**2120-1-21**]. Throughout the day patient had
continued chest pain that began radiating to his left arm and
right jaw. Took 2 SLNG without relief and then went to OSH at
approximately 4pm for further evaluation. Additional symptoms
include shortness of breath and diaphoresis. At OSH ED, patient
required 3 SLNG, NTP 1, lovenox x 1, and 12mg IV morphine for
chest pain relief. Patient's initial ECG demonstrated 2mm STD in
V3-V6, I, and II with STE in aVR. His first troponin was 1.2 and
then increased to 7.1, he was started on aggrenox and lovenox.
.
Patient reports some baseline shortness of breath which he
attributes to his tobacco use; can walk 3 flights of stairs
before becoming short of breath.
.
ROS: +chest pain. +shortness of breath.

[**2120-1-23**]: Cardiac Catheterization -
Initial diagnostic angiography revealed severe 3 vessel disease
with
a normal LMCA, a 90% proximal LAD stenosis followed by a 100%
mid LAD
stenosis, a 100% mid CX occlusion after a small OM1, and a 100%
mid RCA
occlusion. The LIMA-LAD was widely patent with mild luminal
irregularities of the mid and distal LAD.  The SVG-PDA was
widely patent
with mild diffuse disease.  There was a Y graft of the RIMA-OM3
and
SVG-OM2 that had a 90% bifurcation stenosis with 80% extending
into the
proximal SVG graft.  The RIMA-OM3 limb of the Y graft supplied a
larger
territory including OM4 which had a 90% ostial stenosis.
2) Successful PTCA and stenting of the Y graft (RIMA-OM3,
SVG-OM3)
bifurcation stenosis was performed with distal protection.  A
4.0 mm
bare metal stent was placed across the Y bifurcation and into
the RIMA
limb (as this supplied the largest territory) a jailing the
SVG-OM2,
which was then rescued with bifurcation kissing 3.5 and 4.0 mm
kissing
balloons.  Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no
dissection, and normal flow.  (see PTCA comments)
3) Successful PTCA of OM4 was performed through the RIMA-OM3
with a 3.0
mm balloon. Final angiography revealed 30-40% residual stenosis,
no
dissection, and normal flow.  (see PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe stenosis of the Y bifurcation of the RIMA-OM3 and
SVG-OM2.
3. Widely patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-PDA.
4. Severe OM4 ostial stenosis.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the Y bifurcation stenosis of
the
RIMA-OM3 and SVG-OM2 with a bare metal stent.
6. Successful PTCA of OM4.
7. Severely elevated left sided filling pressures.
8. Consider PCI of the proximal LAD and large septals if
evidence of
ischemia.

[**2120-1-26**] Echo -
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
is severely
dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle
(Definity given to evaluate for this). LV systolic function
appears depressed. LVEF 40-45%. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include basal
inferoseptal/inferior/inferolateral akinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo male with pmhx significant for coronary artery disease s/p
CABG and MI in [**2104**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes
mellitus now s/p cardiac cath with BMS and kissing balloons at
the Y graft. with aspirin desensitization
.
PLAN:
.
# CARDIAC
Coronary Artery Disease
Patient admitted for aspirin desensitization prior to cath.
Initial symptoms and ECG concerning for ischemia in
anterolateral leads. Cath demonstrated LAD with proximal lesion
and 0-% after large diag. Left circ occluded ; 90% lesion of
ostia of OM-4; Y graft with RIMA-OM3 and SVG-OMZ with 90% lesion
proximally and 80% ostial lesion at the SVG. Patient had kissing
balloons placed at Y graft with BMS of RIMA to OM3. Now chest
pain free.  He was discharged on aspirin, plavix, beta blocker,
ACEI, statin. He was instructed to continue his aspirin daily to
avoid re-sensitization.
.
Pump
Patient with akinetic apex and with EF initially of 35-40% and
then increased to 40-45% prior to discharge. Patient was fluid
overloaded with evidence of CHF on CXR and also with elevated
JVD. Patient was responsive to lasix and remained stable.
.
Rhythm
NSR
.
# Diabetes Mellitus
Patient's glucophage was held for 3 days post-cath and was
restarted prior to admission. Patient was additionally
maintained with an insulin sliding scale.
.
# Fever
After cardiac catheterization, patient with several days of
persistent low-grade fevers to 100.7 and rising WBC but without
symptoms or complaints. UA suggestive of infection with 6-10
WBCs and occasional bacteria and patient was started on cipro,
but urine and blood cultures were negative. Patient's
antibiotics were discontinued and his WBC was declining upon
discharge.
.
# Tobacco Abuse
Patient continues to use cigarettes. Spoke to patient regarding
smoking cessation, patient is pre-contemplative regarding
quitting but continued to recommend smoking cessation. Patient
also recommended to discuss his tobacco use with his primary
care physician.
.
# Prophylaxis
Patient was maintained with PPI, anticoagulated with aggrastat
initially and then heparin SC, bowel regimen, and incentive
spirometer.
