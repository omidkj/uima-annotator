Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: This study is limited by poor image quality and a
rotated heart with off axis views only. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The prosthetic aortic
valve leaflets are thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is
present (not quantified) Insitu aortic valve prosthesis appears
heavily calcified. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass: Patient is on Epinepherine 0.02 mcg/kg/min, and
phenylepherine 1 mcg/kg/min, V paced
Biventricular funciton is slightly improved with mild to
moderate residual hypokinesis in the inferior wall. A mechanical
prosthethesis is seen in the aortic position with a peak
gradient of 20 on average. No AI or perivavlvuar leaks are seen.
Mitral regurgitation is now mild. Aortic contours are intact.
Remaining exam is unchanged. All finidings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
