Admission Date:  [**2158-5-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2158-6-7**]


Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2151**] who presented to [**Hospital6 1760**] with substernal chest pain
that started upon awakening on the day of admission.  The
pain was in his lower chest and radiated down his arm and was
not associated with shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or
diaphoresis.  The patient denied having prior episodes of
angina in the past.  He was also noted to be tachycardiac to
the 120s.  He received two sublingual Nitroglycerin with good
relief of pain.  He was also given Lopressor 5 mg IV 24 mg
p.o. with resolution of his tachycardia to 71 beats per
minute.  He was pain free on arrival to the Emergency
Department.

His last catheterization was [**2158-3-22**].  He had a
rotational atherectomy of the left main and proximal left
anterior descending stenting.  His LIMA was totally occluded
at that time.  Saphenous vein graft to ramus intermedius was
patent, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery
was also patent.  The initial plan for this admission was to
send for repeat cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2151**] with LIMA to the
left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery, and saphenous vein graft to R1.
2.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
30%.  3.  Hypertension.  4.  High cholesterol.  5.
Parkinson's disease.  6.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.  7.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  8.  Chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3.  9.
Melanoma.  10.  Pancreatic cyst.

ALLERGIES:  INTRAVENOUS DYE AND QUINIDINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Never married.  Remote tobacco history.
Occasional alcohol.  He recently moved to ...................
He has a healthcare proxy who is actively involved in his
care; his name is [**Name (NI) 3065**] [**Name (NI) 24253**], cellular [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96575**],
home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96576**], office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96577**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was premedicated with
Prednisone and Mucomyst prior to cardiac catheterization.  He
became slightly confused during the first night of his
admission after receiving steroids.  His mental status had
improved by the following morning.  The patient went for
cardiac catheterization which showed a 40% left main,
in-stent restenosis, 90% left anterior descending in-stent
restenosis, and also significant with a diagonal of 80%
lesion.  All three lesions were ballooned Rotobladed.  He had
a totally occluded LIMA to the left anterior descending which
had been seen to be totally occluded on a prior
catheterization.  He had a patent saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery, and a patent saphenous vein
graft to RI.

The initial plan was to perform brachy therapy during the
catheterization; however, because the patient became
hypotensive, he was sent to the CCU, and brachy therapy was
not done.  His right atrial pressure at catheterization was
15, pulmonary pressure 43/22, wedge 17, cardiac index of 1.9.

His CCU course was mainly notable for transfusion of several
units of packed red cells for a small hematocrit drop, but he
had no evidence of a major bleed.  He had a chest x-ray which
showed mild congestive heart failure and a right-sided
effusion, and he was aggressively diuresed with intravenous
Lasix.  He became agitated and combative in the CCU and had
to be restrained.  He was given Haldol and Benzodiazepines
with worsening of agitation.  He was observed overnight, and
his congestive heart failure improved, and he was sent back
up to the floor.

On the floor he remained confused, not oriented to place or
person, unable to recognize his heathcare proxy.  Psychiatry
was consulted and recommended starting Zyprexa and avoiding
Benzodiazepines.  He also began to have an increase in
creatinine, so his ACE inhibitor was stopped, and his Lasix
was also continued.  He was also gently hydrated with half
normal saline.

His creatinine drifted back to baseline over the next several
days, and was at his baseline at the time of discharge.  His
hematocrit also remained stable during the remainder of his
hospital course without any need for further transfusion.

Over the next three days, his mental status gradually
improved, and he was able to understand discussions with his
healthcare proxy.  [**Name (NI) **] was completely alert and oriented times
three at the time of discharge.  He also complained of some
shortness of breath, although his oxygen saturation greatly
improved.  He also had some mild lower extremity edema over
the last two days of his hospitalization.  A repeat chest
x-ray on the day of discharge showed that his right-sided
effusion was still present, although his pulmonary edema was
decreased.  Thoracentesis was discussed, and it was decided
instead to restart his Lasix, as this effusion is most likely
due to heart failure, and he will have a follow-up chest
x-ray in [**1-11**] weeks.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to [**Hospital1 **].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
