History of Present Illness:
48F h/o Hep C cirrhosis c/b ascites, encephalopathy and BLE
edema, presented to clinic with lethargy, Na = 113.  Pt reported
that her mother, who helps pt manage her pills, also noted that
pt was "making no sense" this morning.  Pt denied any recent
alcohol or drug intake, and reported that she had a productive
cough with somewhat yellow sputum.  Pt reported that she had not
been having three bowel movements daily, and at least one day
had no stools.
.
In the ED, she was oriented x 2, with positive asterixis.  Pt
received albumin 50g.
.
On first arrival to the floor, pt denied fever, vomiting,
diarrhea, dysuria, bloody stool, joint pain, muscle pain, sore
throat, or changes in vision.  Pt endorsed hunger, fatigue,
tremors, and dizziness.  It was unclear whether pt endorsed or
denied nausea as her account changed, and she was not focused
during the interview.  Pt conducted her admission interview with
her eyes closed, and spoke in a shaky mumble throughout.

# CXR [**2157-7-9**]:
Multifocal patchy opacities seen in the left upper and lower
lung
zones, with cardiomegaly.  This may represent asymmetric
pulmonary edema; however, aspiration/pneumonia cannot be
excluded.  The ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung zone
seen on the prior study has resolved.  A TIPS shunt is present.
.
# ABD US [**2157-7-8**]:
1. Minimal intra-abdominal ascites.  There was insufficient
fluid to mark a location for bedside tap.
2.  Patent appearance of the main portal vein. Measured TIPS
velocities are similar to comparison examination.
.
# CXR [**2157-7-22**]:
IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration in the upper lobes.  Persistent
bilateral
patchy opacities more confluent in the bases, greater on the
right side.

# CXR [**2157-8-1**]:

FINDINGS:  A PA and lateral of the chest were obtained and
compared to the
prior examination dated [**2157-7-30**].  Allowing for differences in
technique,
there is no significant interval change.  The left subclavian
PICC line is
unchanged in position terminating within the expected region of
the proximal superior vena cava.  The enteric feeding catheter
extends beyond the inferior margin of the film.  The diffuse
patchy opacities throughout both lungs are grossly unchanged.
The left patchy opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is
unchanged.  A persistent right pleural effusion is noted.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  Stable examination as above.

# RUQ Ultrasound [**2157-8-3**]:
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to [**2157-7-6**].  The study is
limited
secondary to patient's inability to breath-hold.  There is a
large right
pleural effusion.  Color flow imaging demonstrates a patent TIPS
with wall-to-wall flow though velocities cannot be measured
secondary to respiratory
motion.  The right portal vein is patent and appears to be
hepatofugal though evaluation markedly limited. There is trace
ascites in the pelvis, but inadequate for paracentesis.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Limited exam.  Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow.
2.  Trace ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
48F h/o HCV cirrhosis, admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 with hyponatremia,
hepatic encephalopathy, and questionable respiratory symptoms.
.
# PNA: As pt reported syptoms of productive cough, admission CXR
was obtained which demonstrated RUL infiltrate suspicious for
infection.  In light of her recent hospitalization, pt was
started on ciprofloxacin 400mg IV q12H ([**7-6**]) for nosocomial PNA.
 To cover the possibility of aspiration PNA as pt's hepatic
encephalopathy persisted, abx were broadened to vancomycin
([**7-9**])/pip-taz ([**7-9**])/azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 11067**]).  Abx were
discontinued on [**7-18**] given completed total abx course of
approximately 10 days.  Serial chest xrays every other day
showed gradual interval improvement.
.
# Respiratory compromise: On admission, pt was ambulatory with
no oxygen requirement, and pt was placed on home regimen of
albuterol and fluticasone-salmeterol 100-50 mcg/dose [**Hospital1 **].  On
[**7-8**], pt received 1 unit PRBC for Hct = 20.9.  On [**7-9**], HD#3,
patient c/o increasing SOB, with RR = 30, PaO2 = 61 on 4L NC,
PCO2 = 33, pH 7.44.  Repeat CXR demonstrated new L upper and
lower lung infiltrates and likely volume overload.  Pt's acute
respiratory compromise was considered to be possibly
multifactorial, with contributions from asthma exacerbation,
PNA, fluid overload, and possible TRALI.  TTE performed in the
MICU demonstrated hyperdynamic EF, enlarged LA, and no evidence
of pulmonary HTN.  Pt was intubated from [**2163-7-13**] to support
respiratory capacity.  On [**7-21**] transfer to floor, pt had been
extubated for four days, with improved respiratory status and
O2sat in the mid-90s on 4L.  She was weened down to 3L, where
she remained stable.
.
# Adrenal insufficiency [**1-7**] liver failure: Pt was initially
maintained on her home regimen of prednisone 5 mg daily.  Upon
transfer to the MICU, stress dose steroids were administered in
the setting of infection, respiratory compromise, and pt's
background adrenal insufficiency.  After transferring back to
the floor, pt was transitioned ultimately to hydrocortisone to
provide both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity.  She
is discharged on 20 mg hydrocortisone qday.
.
# Asthma: After pt's episode of respiratory insufficiency, pt
was continued on standing albuterol and fluticasone-salmeterol
nebs, with home regimen of montelukast held.  She continued
albuterol and fluticasone/salmeteral n
