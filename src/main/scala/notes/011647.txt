History of Present Illness:
 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. [**Known lastname 64713**] is a 63 year-old female
with a history of CAD status post MI in [**10/2118**], status post
stents X3 (last on [**2119-4-14**]) currently on ASA and Plavix, atrial
fibrillation no longer on Coumadin given a history of
life-threatening lower GI bleed in [**11/2118**] (at which time
Coumadin was discontinued and Plavix was initiated), also with
CHF and PVD, who presents from home with a 1-day history of
"dark stools". Of note, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**11/2118**]
with a lower GI bleed while on Coumadin and ASA. At that time,
endoscopy was remarkable for EGD with mild gastritis (negative
H. pylori), and C-scope with multiple diverticula and polyps,
with a blood clot seen at the hepatic flexure with diverticula
and polyps underneath without active bleeding. A tagged RBC scan
was positive for tracer uptake at the hepatic flexure, but an
angiogram was negative, and an intervention was not performed.
ASA and Plavix were subsequently restarted.
*
She now reports that she started having marroon-colored stools
at night before admission. She subsequently had 10 other BMs
with marroon-colored stools and bright red blood mixed in. She
notes that she feels the urge to move her bowels, and does not
have bleeding in between. She had transient abdominal discomfort
in the LLQ, which lasted 30 minutes and spontaneously resolved.
She is currently pain free. She reports mild shortness of
breath, without chest pain. She had transient lightheadedness
last night, now improved. No recent fever or chills, no other
complaints.
*
In ED, T 98.1, HR 82, BP 168/66, RR 18, Sat 99% on RA. DRE per
ED notes with melena and bright red blood. She declined an NG
lavage. She was given Protonix 40 mg IV X1. She remained
hemodynamically stable while in the ED, and was admitted to 11R.
There, she had 2 other bloody BMs. Orthostatic vitals showed a
mild increase in HR (currently on BB).


Past Medical History:
--LGIB: Admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**2118-12-1**] with massive LGIB while on
coumadin and plavix after NSTEMI and A.fib. s/p >20 units pRBCs
during this admission. s/p multiple colonoscopies, bleeding
scans -->diverticular bleed, localized bleed to hepatic
flexture, unable to perform intervention. Now stable. Off
coumadin due to lifethreatening LGIB.
--MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION [**2118-11-15**] NSTEMI with peak CK 204 and

--ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Developed PAF during admission for NSTEMI
[**10-31**] converted to sinus rhythm with beta blocker,
anticoagulated with coumadin s/p massive LGIB. Now off coumadin.

--ANEMIA [**2118-12-12**] Hemolytic Anemia - unclear etiology after
extensive inpatient w/up. Initially thought to be delayed
transfusio reaction given 20+ units transfused [**12-29**] LGIB. Blood
bank w/up however negative. Heme consult placed, negative for
G6PD deficiency, other causes. Currently stable.
--FIBROMYALGIA Longstanding history - takes Percocet 7.5/325 120
tabs per month

hypertensive crisis and pulmonary edema. Renal U/S negative for
obstruction [**2118-12-12**]. Followed by renal. Currently under better
control - some degree of permissive hypertension given
elevated creatinine.
--BREAST CANCER s/p R mastectomy ~20 years ago
--CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE EF 35-40% 3+ TR or 1+ MR, e/a 0.45
--PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE s/p bifem bypass
--? PATENT FORAMEN OVALE: conflicting echo readings [**10-31**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring given concern
for her brisk LGI bleed.  She remained hemodynamically stable
with slight decreases in her hematocrit.   She underwent a
tagged RBC scan which was not revealing in terms of her bleeding
source.  She was transfused to maintain her hct >28 given her
h/o CAD.  Unfortunately, due to her recent stent placement, her
ASA and Plavix had to be continued.  GI was consulted who
recommended transfusions as needed, and prep for c-scope.  Her
c-scope was finally performed on [**5-15**] which did not show any
active bleeding, but with diffuse diverticulosis throughout her
entire colon, and multiple polyps.  It was thought that likely
one of her diverticula bled, but it was unclear exac
