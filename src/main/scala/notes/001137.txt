Chief Complaint:
s/p TACE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transarterial chemoembolization [**2162-2-15**]
mechanical intubation

History of Present Illness:
This 60-year-old gentleman with h/o chronic HCV and cirrhosis
who has been followed with regular u/s and MRIs and recently
found to have two less than 1 cm nodules that subsequently
progressed to numerous nodules. He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] and
underwent targeted liver biopsy, which confirmed HCC in three of
the five nodules, making him no longer transplant eligible.
Today he underwent his first chemoembolization.
For his HCV, he had been treated with ribavirin and interferon,
without response.  He is followed closely for this and was
diagnosed with varices in the past but recent endoscopy did not
show any varices.  He has no histopry of encephalopathy, ascites
or GI bleed.
Pt underwent chemoembolization today and during procedure became
very uncomfortable with epigastric abd pain [**8-25**], requiring
dilaudid, toradol.  His BP was increased to SBP 200s, and
required also hydralazine.  At this time, the patient is feeling
better, his pain has decreased to [**2159-12-19**].  He denies any
associated n/v/fever, chills, rigors, lightheadedness,
palpitations.
ROS: pt denies HA, weight chamges, fatigue, cough, SOB, CP,
dysuria, constipation.  Full ten point ROS was otehrwise
negative.

Past Medical History:
1.  HCV cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension, esophageal
varices, hepatoma.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  COPD.
4.  Orbit repair


Social History:
Social History:  Half-pack-per-day smoker.  No ETOH, no IVDA,
occasional marijuana use. lives with his wife and dog.  He has
three grown children.  He works as a postal clerk.

PHYSICAL EXAM:

General: no acute distress, jaundiced, a+ox3
HEENT: +scleral icterus, MMM

Pertinent Results:
MRI performed on [**2161-11-24**] showed at least four hepatic lesions
up to 1 cm in size, two of which have slightly increased and
demonstrate washout and two with borderline  washout; all
concerning for HCC.  Several additional nodules which are
subcentimeter in size, are also concerning for HCC but too small
for definitive imaging  diagnosis.

SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Status post TACE treatment, complicating by
pneumonia and
hepatic coma. New oxygen requirement.

Comparison is made with prior study, [**2-24**].

Right lower lobe opacity has markedly increased, a combination
of pleural
effusion and adjacent consolidation. Left lower lobe opacities
have
increased, could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia. There is no

pneumothorax. Cardiac size is normal. Right PICC tip is in the
lower SVC.

LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND

DATE: [**2162-2-26**].

COMPARISON: Liver ultrasound [**2162-2-18**], CT abdomen and
pelvis [**2162-2-20**], chemoembolization [**2162-2-15**].

CLINICAL INDICATION: 60-year-old man with hepatitis C status
post TACE
procedure, elevated and rising bilirubin of unclear etiology.
Question
obstruction.

TECHNIQUE: Multiple son[**Name (NI) 493**] grayscale images of the abdomen
were obtained
with select images supplemented with color Doppler and spectral
waveform
analysis.

FINDINGS:

The liver demonstrates coarsened echotexture consistent with
known cirrhosis.
Echogenic foci within the right hepatic lobe are consistent with
sequelae of
recent TACE procedure. This examination was not tailored to
evaluate for
liver lesions. The gallbladder is nondistended and demonstrates
diffuse
gallbladder wall thickening measuring up to 3 mm, stable from
prior CT
examination. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary
dilation with the
common hepatic duct measuring 4 mm.

The main portal vein is patent, but demonstrates persistent
hepatofugal flow.
Visualized portions of the pancreas are within normal limits
with the
pancreatic head, uncinate process and tail non-visualized
secondary to
shadowing from overlying bowel gas. There is a small amount of
ascites seen
in the right lower quadrant and perihepatic locations. The
spleen measures
approximately 13.2 cm. Representative images of the kidneys
demonstrate no
hydronephrosis.


IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of biliary obstruction. Circumferential
gallbladder wall
thickening, stable from recent CT, which likely relates to
underlying liver
disease.

2. Sequelae of recent TACE. Coarsened, heterogeneous liver
consistent with
cirrhosis with stable reversal of flow in the patent main portal
vein.

3. Small amount of perihepatic and right lower quadrant ascites.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Final Report
INDICATION: Altered mental status, status post chemoembolization
procedure.

COMPARISON: CT head from [**2162-2-22**].

TECHNIQUE: MRI of the head was obtained before and after
administration of
contrast per department protocol.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, edema,
mass, or
mass effect. Ventricles and sulci are age appropriate. Few
scattered
T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are seen in the periventricular white
matter, which
are nonspecific and may represent small vessel ischemic disease.
Visualized
orbits, paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. There is minimal
fluid sig
