Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83057**] is an 83 yo female with IDDM, HTN, dyslipidemia and
h/o lung cancer s/p XRT and RLL resection who was taken to an
OSH by her family for increased SOB and found to be hypotensive
with a large pericardial effusion and RUL opacity on CT. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and management of the
pericardial effusion.
.
Per family, she has had progressive SOB over the past month. At
baseline, she is a "couch potato" and does not leave the house
or exert herself much, but on the morning of admission stayed in
bed due to fatigue and told her family that she wanted to be
taken to the hospital. She has had a cough for several weeks,
which has sounded wet but not been productive of sputum or
blood. She has been clammy but the family denies F/C, N/V. She
has had decreased appetite but no weight loss.
.
On further review of systems, the family denies any prior
history of MI, syncope, stroke or TIA. Her husband does note
black stools recently, but in the setting of iron pills. She is
incontinent of urine at baseline. She is also occasionally
lightheaded at home.
.
At the OSH, she had negative LENIs and no PE on CTA. She was
started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for ? RUL PNA.
.
In our ED, initial vitals were T 97.3, HR 103, BP 111/67, POs
100%. She was given 1.5L fluid, ondansetron, albuterol and
ipratroprium nebulizers. Bedside U/S showed a large effusion
with RV collapse and tamponade physiology. Pulsus paradoxus was
30-40. She was taken to the cath lab for pericardiocentesis.
.
In the cath lab, she was initially hypotensive. An arterial
groin line and venous groin line were place along with swan-ganz
catheter. Initial PCWP was 30mmHg. Pericardicentesis showed
initial pericardial pressure 30mmHg. 600cc of bloody fluid were
drained and the pericardial pressure decreased to zero. PCWP
post-procedure declined to 20mmHg. She was intubated due to
increased agitation and progression of her acidosis which was
thought to represent lactic acidosis. She received 2g zosyn in
the cath lab.
.
On arrival to the unit, she was sedated and intubated, with
stable blood pressures of SBP 130s.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiac tamponade-
On arrival, the patient was noted to have a large pericardial
effusion on bedside echo. She underwent pericardiocentesis in
the cath lab, with 600 cc bloody fluid drained, resulting in
normalization of systemic and pulmonary wedge pressures. Fluid
was sent for chemical and cytological analysis, and showed no
malignant cells. However, etiology of pericardial effusion is
most likely malignant, as patient has lung cancer diagnosed over
1 year ago for which she preferred no treatment. She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout course. Home BP meds (ACE)
were held for borderline blood pressures. A repeat echo on [**6-30**]
showed no evidence of pericardial fluid reaccumulation, with
normal RV chamber size and wall motion. LVEF was >75%.

2. RUL PNA-
CXR at admission showed right upper lobe pneumonia, likely
post-obstructive due to right upper lobe mass, and small right
pleural effusion. WBC was 12.5 at admission. The patient was
started on Levo/Flagyl for a 10 day course which will be
completed on [**7-7**]. Blood cultures were pending, sputum cultures
showed rare yeast and urine Legionella antigen was negative.
Patient remained afebrile throughout course and WBC trended down
to normal range. She was initially intubated
post-pericardiocentesis for agitation and increasing anion gap
metabolic acidosis, thought to be lactic acidosis. She was
successfully extubated, but continued to require high flow
oxygen and nebs prn. Family and patient were consulted regarding
possible pulmonary intervention (bronchoscopy +/- stenting) but
they declined in favor of non-invasive care moving towards
palliative care.

3. R pleural effusion-
Etiology may be malignant or infectious. Unlikely to be cardiac
etiology since echo showed normal EF and effusion was
right-sided only. Therefore, diuretics would likely not be
helpful, and were held in light of tenuous blood pressure.

4. UTI-
Urinalysis on admission showed 21-50 WBCs and moderate bacteria.
Patient was already on Levofloxacin for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] no additional
antibiotics were started. Urine culture was negative.

5. Respiratory distress-
Patient was extubated successfully but required high Fi02 face
mask and nebs prn. Likely due to underlying COPD and lung
pathology, as well as post-obstructive PNA. Will continue to
oxygenate as needed and complete course of Levo/Flagyl as above.

6. Acid/base disturbance-
ABG post cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a
lactate of 1.3 and normal PCO2. Given hypotension in the setting
of cardiac tamponade, this likely reflected lactic acidosis
along with respiratory alkalosis in the setting of respiratory
distress. Acid-base status improved as vent settings were
adjusted accordingly. Her most recent ABG was from [**6-29**]- pH 7.34
CO2 41 O2 87.

7. CAD/HL-
No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode. Cardiac
enzymes negative for ACS.  Off simvastatin given comfort focus
of care.

8. Presumed ARF-
Baseline Cre unknown but was 1.4 at admission. A component of
prerenal ARF was likely given hypotension in setting of
tamponade. Creatinine trended down to 0.8 by discharge.

9.DM-2: Home basal lantus dose was continued with SSI coverage.

10. Speech/swallow- Patient is approved for thin liquids and
crushed or whole medications as tolerated.
