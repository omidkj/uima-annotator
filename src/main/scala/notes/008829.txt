Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62 yo F with with a history of Stage III COPD (FEV1 27%) on
steroids and 3L oxygen, systolic CHF s/p ICD and ppm placement,
HTN, p/w shortness of breath to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-22**]. Please see
initial admit note for full history. She is transferred to the
ICU at this time for hypercarbia and increased work of
breathing. She was recently admitted on [**3-21**] for COPD
exacerbation for which she was treated with duonebs nebs, IV
steroids and required BiPAP and admission to the MICU. She was
discharged to rehab on a 2 week prednisone taper and instructed
to f/u with pulmonology and her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] her recent discharge
she has been able to titrate down her supplemental oxygen from
3L/min to 0.5 - 1 L/min.
.
On [**4-22**] she presented with increased shortness of breath and
lightheadedness with exertion since this morning. Patient stated
symptoms "feels like a normal COPD exacerbation". She also
complains of a productive cough that started that day, but
denied hematemesis, fevers, chills, n/v, chest pain, abdominal
pain, or leg swelling. She denies any known sick contacts but
has been residing in a rehab center since her discharge last
month. She reports she is up to date on her flu and pneumococcal
vaccines. She does admit to dietary indiscretions with increased
salt intake.
.
In ED VS were T 97.1 HR 110 BP 135/75 RR 20 SpO2 100%. She was
noted to have crackles at left lung base, but no acute process
on CXR. She had significant leukocytosis WBC 17.9. Troponin was
at baseline 0.02 and EKG showed sinus tach 108, LAD, NI, +TWI
V5-V6, <1mm V5-V6 (new from last admission). She recieved nebs
x2, levofloxacin 750 mg IV and solu-medrol 125 mg IV prior to
transfer to the medicine floor for presumed COPD exacerbation.
.
On the floor she was transitioned to oral prednisone 60 mg
daily, and treated with azithromycin and standing nebs. She was
continue on home diuretics and betablockers, with the assessment
that CHF was partially contributing the patients dyspnea, given
elevated BNP and crackles on exam.
.
At 1:30 pm today, patient felt sudden onset of worsening dyspnea
without chest pain. Patient was noted to have increased work of
breathing, with the use of ascessory muscles. She was saturating
94% on 2L but ABG showed CO2 of 60. She was given solumedrol,
nebs and lasix 80 mg IV x1, and morphine 2 mg IV.

DISCHARGE LABS:
................................................................
MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2183-4-24**] Urine Legionella Ag: negative
[**2183-4-24**] Respiratory Viral Screen/Cx: negative
[**2183-4-25**] MRSA Screen: negative
[**2183-4-26**] Stool: negative for C. diff
................................................................
IMAGING:
[**2183-4-22**] CXR: Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. COPD. No
radiographic evidence for pneumonia or congestive heart failure.

.
[**2183-4-25**] CTA:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute pathology. No pneumonia or
pulmonary edema. Minimal bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
Minimal right pleural effusion.
2. Stable appearance of right upper lobe wedge resection. Severe
emphysema with upper lobe predominance. Similar severe
cardiomegaly.
3. 10 x 8 mm rounded left lower lobe nodule, increased from 7 x
7 mm on [**2183-3-14**]. The apparent growing size in a short
interval favors infectious or inflammatory in etiology, but
neoplasm remains high in the differential given the [**Hospital 228**]
medical history. A three-month followup must be performed per
recommendation from the prior study.
.
[**2183-4-28**] CXR: Previous left lower lobe atelectasis or
consolidation has improved. Lungs are severely emphysematous but
clear of any focal abnormality. There is no vascular engorgement
or appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is top normal,
improved since the earlier examinations. Transvenous right
atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads
follow their expected courses. Chain suture suggests prior wedge
resection from the right upper lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old woman with with a history of Stage III COPD (FEV1
27%) on steroids and 3L oxygen, systolic CHF s/p ICD and
pacemaker placement, HTN, who p/w shortness of breath and was
transferred to the MICU for hypercarbia and worsening dyspnea.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient admitted with
dyspnea, initially felt to be secondary to a COPD exacerbation.
She was first admitted to general medicine floor and had been
started on steroids, azithromycin, and nebs. Was transferred to
MICU on [**4-23**] (HD #1) given concern that she was tiring on the
floor and might require BiPAP. Trigger for COPD exacerbation
unclear. Respiratory viral screen negative, urine legionella
antigen negative, and no evidence of pneumonia on CXR or CT.
Patient was continued on steroid taper, azithromycin x5 days,
and albuterol/ipratropium nebs. As patient on long term
steroids, continued Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. Patient trialed briefly
on BiPAP on several occasions in ICU, though did not tolerate
well. Serial ABGs revealed pCO2 in 60s-70s, likely close to
patient's baseline. Was also some concern for systolic CHF
exacerbation contributing to respiratory distress. Patient
endorsed dietary indiscretion and had elevated BNP, though
imaging was not suggestiv
