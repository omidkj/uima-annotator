Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizures.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Entotracheal intubation.
Central venous and arterial line placement.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 31 yo W with h/o intractable epilepsy who presented to
OSH after having 7 seizures.

We intially had limited information given patient intubation and
sedation and no collateral available. Based on OSH records,
patient is seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital1 487**] for temporal lobe
epilepsy, with partial complex seizures and generalized
seizures.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and [**Name2 (NI) 90054**] that Ms. [**Known lastname 11041**] was able to
afford medications, was on this regimen due to intolerance of
numerous agents, that she was typically poorly compliant but
that recent control of seizures had been better.

She takes Keppra, Lyrica and Vimpat, and has a VNS. A note from
[**2178-4-7**] states that her seizures have been well
controlled since [**Month (only) 359**]/[**Month (only) **] on this regimen. The patient
had 6 seizures at home tonight before EMS was called, she then
had another one. There is no description of the events (but
later inferred to be GTC seizures given amnesia, whole body ache
afterward, leukocytosis).

She was given Ativan 2 mg x 3, loaded with Dilantin and Keppra.
She did not return to baseline mental status in between seizures
or after treatment, and she was intubated for airway protection.
Head CT was normal. CXR showed diffuse infiltrates c/w
aspiration vs ARDS, and patient was requiring substantial
ventilator settings. She was reportedly combative and trying to
pull on tubes, so she received vecuronium before transfer as
well. She was hypotensive, and arrives on 2 pressors.

In the ED, the patient remained intubated and sedated. She was
continued on norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and antibiotics
started at OSH (CTX, azithro, and Flagyl was added). There was
concern for status epilepticis.

Past Medical History:
Temporal lobe epilepsy s/p VNS
Migraine
Anxiety/depression
Bipolar disorder
Coarctation of the aorta
Anemia
Asthma

Social History:
On [**Social Security Number 90055**]social security. Some alcohol, recent cocaine (Friday night).
Occaisonal smoking for many years "when stressed". Daily
marijuana smoking. Lives with boyfriend, two children and

Family History:
Paternal aunt with "walks out of the house without clothes on
and police would find her". Family attributes this to epilepsy.
No other siezures in family.

Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus/mass is seen in
the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


CXR [**2178-5-18**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right
subclavian line has been removed. The other monitoring and
support devices are in unchanged position. Unchanged size of the
cardiac silhouette. Unchanged severity of bilateral pulmonary
opacities. Increase in extent of a retrocardiac atelectasis.

CT Head [**2178-5-17**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute intracranial abnormality.
MRI would be more sensitive for anoxic injury, if indicated.

EEG [**2178-5-17**] (further EEG's pending)
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured a single pushbutton
activation that did not show evidence of seizures. Routine
sampling showed a mildly encephalopathic background with faster
frequencies suggestive of medication effect. There was also some
more normal-appearing sleep patterns later in the night but
continued bursts of generalized slowing and occasional
suppressions of the background to suggest encephalopathy. There
were no prominent focal abnormalities, and there were no
definite epileptiform features.
