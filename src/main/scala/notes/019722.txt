Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 89-year-old white
male with past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and remote myocardial
infarction in [**2117**], now presents with 2-3 week of chest
tightness.  The patient complained of anterior chest pain
that radiated to his left neck and back, which was increased
with exertion.  The patient complained of increased shortness
of breath and difficulty sleeping over the past three nights.

One night prior to admission, the patient had one episode of
PND.  Describes gradual onset of this chest soreness and
chest pain, but with association of night sweats.  Patient
was unable to tolerate the pain, so presented initially to an
outside hospital.  Cardiac enzymes were elevated with a CK of
321 and CK MB of 21, and a troponin of 28.  Patient was given
Morphine, IV Lopressor, and aspirin in the Emergency
Department.  At the outside hospital, his electrocardiogram
showed evidence of sinus dysrhythmia, left bundle branch
block.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for emergent catheterization in the setting of
elevated cardiac enzymes and a new left bundle.

Cardiac catheterization showed diffuse three vessel disease
with distal RCA with 90% stenosis, proximal LAD with 95%
stenosis, and a circumflex 70% proximal lesion.  The proximal
LAD was stented without residual stenosis.  LV gram showed
apical akinesia.  There is evidence of pulmonary
hypertension, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and an ejection
fraction of 25%.  In the CCU, the patient was without chest
pain or shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking 40 years ago.
Currently drinks one glass of wine nightly.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Doses unavailable.
1. Norvasc.
2. Atenolol.
3. Methyldopa.
4. Glyburide.
5. Hydrochlorothiazide.
6. Potassium chloride supplements.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial examination, the patient's
vital signs:  Temperature of 97.8, heart rate of 89, blood
pressure 106/56, respiratory rate 22, sating 95% on
nonrebreather.  Generally, the patient was calm in no acute
distress.  HEENT showed pupils are equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, S1, S2, faint heart sounds,
unable to appreciate murmurs.  Left side of the chest wall
was tender to palpation.  Lungs with bibasilar crackles.
Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, distended, tympanitic
to percussion, nontender, no evidence of rebound or guarding.
Extremities:  Faint distal pulses which were dopplerable.
Right lower extremity was cool to the touch (Patient has
noted this at baseline).  No edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After PCI of the proximal LAD, the patient
was without any further chest pains.  The patient was
continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Integrilin.  Patient's CKs
peaked at 581.  CK MB peaked at 30, and troponin-T was
elevated to 2.13.  Patient demonstrated an ejection fraction
of 25% with left ventricular wall motion abnormalities.
Patient was initially started on captopril 6.25 mg tid for
afterload reduction and diuresis.  Captopril was titrated.
Patient diuresed and O2 requirement decreased.

Patient had evidence of sinus dysrhythmia on his initial
electrocardiogram now with a left bundle branch block, is
currently in a regular rhythm.  Patient's respiratory status
continued to improve.  There is evidence of pulmonary
vascular congestion on chest x-ray.  Patient was further
diuresed with Lasix.  Patient had a slight peak in his
creatinine at 1.4, however, creatinine improved and was 1.0
at discharge.

Patient was also noted to have hematuria.  This was thought
to be due to multiple traumatic Foley placements in the CCU.
Urine culture and urinalysis were obtained.  Evidence of
Citrobacter in the urine.  The patient was treated with
Levaquin 500 mg q day to complete a seven day course of
antibiotics.  Patient's hematocrit remained stable during
this admission.

On discharge, patient was free of chest pain.  Hematocrit was
38.0.  His creatinine was 1.0.  Patient was adequately
diuresed, no longer requiring oxygen.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Anterior myocardial infarction.

OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Mitral regurgitation.
4. Diabetes.
5. Coronary artery disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Plavix 75 mg po q day.
2. Coumadin 5 mg po q day.
3. Lisinopril 20 mg po q day.
4. Atorvastatin 10 mg po q day.
5. Glyburide 2.5 mg po q day.
6. Toprol XL 100 mg po q day.
7. Levofloxacin 250 mg po q day x7 days.
8. Aspirin 81 mg po q day.

FOLLOWUP:
1. The patient is to receive VNA services at home to monitor
INR.
2. The patient is to telephone primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 17996**], for an appointment in [**12-7**] weeks.
