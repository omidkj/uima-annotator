History of Present Illness:
84 year old male status post left upper lobe and left lower lobe
video assisted wedge resections on [**2161-5-5**]. He was discharged
home
with intrathoracic [**Doctor Last Name **] drain to [**Doctor Last Name 84856**] on [**5-2**] and
presents  to the emergency department on [**2161-5-4**] with increased
dark [**Doctor Last Name **] drain output, 2-3 episodes non-frothy pink emesis
followed by bilious emesis [**5-4**] prior to admission.

Recent hospital course notable for persistent leak with stable
serial CXRs prior to [**Month/Year (2) 84856**] placement on discharge.
Infectious disease consultation obtained due to granulomata and
hyphal forms on tissue pathology without evidence of
angioinvasion. Fungal cultures of resected tissue and induced
sputum for fungal culture are negative. Serum Aspergillus

deferred with plan to complete work-up as outpatient.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2161-5-11**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.


   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
[**2161-5-6**]: Pleural fluid no growth

CXR:
[**2161-5-12**]: The left apical chest tube has been removed. The small
left apical
pneumothorax is stable. Left pleural abnormality with thickening
of the
pleural margin from the sulcus to the apex, mostly posteriorly,
is unchanged. Right basilar pleural thickening is also stable.
The right lung base is slightly clearer than at 8:56am. Cardiac
and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The left PICC ends in
the upper SVC. Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.
IMPRESSION: Stable small left apical pneumothorax after chest
tube removal.

Chest CT
[**2161-5-5**]: 1. Moderate left hematopneumothorax, slightly
increased from prior exam. No evidence of active contrast
extravasation.
2. No evidence of PE or aortic dissection.
3. Extensive subq gas and pneumomediastinum slightly improved
from prior exam.
4. Hepatic hypodensities, not fully characterized, may represent
a hemangioma.
5. sigmoid diverticula without inflammtion.
6. BL ingluinal hernias with loops of bowel, unchanged.

Echo:
[**2161-5-7**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve is not well seen. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 37424**] is a 84 year-old male admitted with a left
hemothorax taken to the operating [**2161-5-6**] for Left video
assisted thoracoscopic surgery, decortication and washout.  He
was extubated in the operating room, monitored in the PACU.
While in the PACU he had an episode of transient AV block,
Oliguric.  He was transfer to the SICU for further monitoring.

ID: Followed by ID for left pleural culture with Coag + staph
aureus, and enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin.

Respiratory: neb, good pain his oxygenation improved to 97% 3L
nasal cannula his home dose.  Home inhalers were continued

Chest-tube were removed [**5-11**] & 28 once all the pleural culture
was final.

Cardiac: on [**2161-5-7**] he was seen by cardiology for transient AVB
with was self limiting with no further events.  An
Echocardiogram with EF 75% no wall motion abdomality.  He
remained in sinus rhythm 80's without ectopy.  Blood pressure
stable 110-130.  ASA & statin were continued.

GI: PPI and bowel regime.  Tolerated a regular diet

Renal: normal renal function with good urine output.

IV: PICC left basilic 52 cm single lumen terminates in mid SVC
placed [**2161-5-12**]

Disposition: He was seen by physical therapy.  He was discharged
home with [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital3 269**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111719**] [**Name (NI) 269**], PT, Critical [**Name (NI) **]
