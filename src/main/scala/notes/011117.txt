History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21160**] is an 87 [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident with a history of
coronary disease, s/p MI [**2167**], type II diabetes on oral therapy,
dementia, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, s/p recent admission
for hip fracture, with preop cath, found to have 3VD disease,
and s/p TEE cardioversion for atrial tachycardia who now
presents with 2 episodes of BRBPR and melena, 2x times.
.
In ED, HCT was initally 27 but with IVF dropped quickly to 19.
NG lavage negative. He subsequently became tachycardic and
hypotensive despite 6U of PRBC, 2U Factor [**7-23**] and 2U of FFP
transfusions and was intubated and started on dopamine while
waiting for angiography.

[**10-2**] GI bleed study: No active GI bleeding identified.
.
[**10-3**] colonoscopy: Diverticulosis of the colon
Normal mucosa in the colon

[**10-3**] endoscopy: Normal EGD to second part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
a/p: 87 yo man with afib on coumadin, CHF, DMII, now with
massive lower GIB.
.
# GIB: Bleeding source was felt to be from a lower GI source
given negative NG lavage with BRBPR,  neg bleeding scan and EGD.
 Colonoscopy c/w diverticular bleed, although no active bleeding
seen. Initially rec'd 6U PRBC w/ appropriate bump in HCT.
however, while in angio, patient rec'd add'l 4U PRBC.  HCT
therefore transfused beyond goal, to approx 45.  Also rec'd 3U
FFP.  Maintained on [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  On transfer HCT stable. During
pt's prolonged MICU course, he developed recurrent BRBPR. On
[**10-17**] he underwent a tagged RBC scan which revealed bleeding in
the mid-transverse colon.    Selective superior mesenteric
arteriography revealed active extravasation from a third-order
terminal branch of the right middle colic artery and he
underwent successful superselective embolization of the bleeding
vessel using two microcoils and four straight coils with
immediate cessation of bleeding. Pt continued to have guiac
positive stools, but no further intervention was needed.
.
# Shock: initially though likely due to GIB and volume loss.  Hx
of diastolic CHF (last EF > 60%) and known 3VD. CXR consistent
with worsening failure. However following volume resuscitation
patient could not be weaned from pressors.  Started on Vanco,
Levo, Flagyl which he was maintained on until [**10-6**] (cultures
neg, off pressers).  Mvo2 71% and TTE was w/o evidence of
systolic dysfxn.  Titrated off norepinephrine on [**10-5**].
Throughout the prolonged MICU course, pt was intermittently
hypotensive, in the setting of diuresis, requiring intermittent
pressors.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Pt had respiratory failure of
multifactorial etiology secondary to diastolic CHF (in the
setting of large blood transfusion and IVF), multi-lobar
pneumonia, and possible ARDS physiology. Pt was diuresed as his
blood pressure tolerated. Pt was briefly extubated initially -
then required re-intubation. At the end of the pt's MICU course,
he was extubated. After discussions with the pt's HCP, he was
made DNR/DNI. During the morning that the pt expired, he was
noted to be breathing comfortably. A few minutes later, pt's
monitor was not [**Location (un) 1131**] a pulse ox. While the nurse and medical
team was at the bedside, pt became bradycardic and asystolic. No
CPR was initiated given pt's code status. He passed away very
quickly.
.
# Atrial fibrilliation: Difficult to control in the recent past.
On Amiodarone and Metoprolol for rate/rhythm control. In SR in
MICU initially. Amiodarone and Metoprolol were re-started when
BP stable.  Coumadin was held due to massive GIB. During the
MICU course, pt went into Af/Aflutter. He was seen by the EP
service who cardioverted him, given the possibility that his AF
was contributing to hemodynamic instability. Pt was successfully
converted into SR.
.
# CAD: Known 3VD. Initially held Aspirin, but re-started
following stable hct x48h.  Metoprolol as above.
.
# DM II: Maintained intermittently on insulin gtt and RISS
.
# PPX: Maintained on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and heparin sc once stable.
