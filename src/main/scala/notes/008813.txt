Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective admission for submandibular excision for chronic
sialolithiasis but found to have stroke on POD#2.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left submandibular excision for chronic sialolithiasis


History of Present Illness:
73 year-old right-handed gentleman with a history of
hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, anxiety, and chronic
siadenitis of the left submandibular gland due to a stone, who
was noted to have right hemiplegia, language difficulties, and
right-sided neglect after a left submandibular resection this
morning.

The patient took 20 mg diazapam for his anxiety this morning in
anticipation of his elective surgery today.  Staff report that
there was no noted weakness or other neurologic abnormality at
this time, though he seemed relatively quiet.  He reportedly
signed the consent for the procedure on his own, with the right
hand.  He was induced under anesthesia at 7:48 am.  The surgery
itself was complicated by labile blood pressure, including a
brief period of hypotension to 80 mmHg (~1 minute); the patient
was given a dose of ephedrine.  His systolic blood pressure
subsequently rose to ~140, though there was some concern that
the blood pressure cuff was not giving an accurate [**Location (un) 1131**].
Pressures later normalized.  The patient was extubated without
incident at 10:10 am.  His post-operative neurologic examination
was limited, as he was coming off sedation.  However, by 11:40
am, Neurology was paged by Anesthesiology for concern that the
patient had developed a right hemiplegia, language difficulties,
and right-sided neglect.

Of note, the patient has been on a baby aspirin daily, though
this was reportedly discontinued approximately one week prior to
the surgery.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 96.8 F   BP 129/59   P 68    RR 14    SaO2 98 on 3LNC
General: NAD, elderly man, well-nourished
HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, MMM, no exudates in oropharynx
Neck: no bruits appreciated, has a clean, dry, and intact
surgical wound on the left aspect of the neck, with drain in
place ROM: able to actively turn head to both sides, though
further assessment limited given wound
Lungs: clear to auscultation, though limited effort
CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present
Ext: warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated
Skin: no rashes

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status:
Awake and alert, unable to relay history, cooperative with exam
though appears to be limited by comprehension, able to state
first and last name, identify nose and fingers, but not a watch
or pictures on stroke card; his speech is non-fluent and
dysarthric, he is unable to repeat the examiner; he appears to
pay more attention to left space, though he can attend to people
approaching his right side in bed

Cranial Nerves:
Fundoscopy could not be performed; blinks to threat throughout
bilaterally.  Pupils reactive to light, 4 to 3 mm bilaterally,
though the right may be a bit irregular.  Extraocular movements
intact, no nystagmus.  Facial sensation intact to light touch
bilaterally.  Right upper motor neuron facial droop.  Palate
elevates midline.  Tongue protrudes midline, no fasciculations.
Cannot follow commands for testing spinal accessory nerve.

Sensorimotor:
Normal bulk and perhaps somewhat reduced tone on the right.  He
is able to move his left arm spontaneously, purposefully and
anti-gravity, though his left leg moves only minimally even to
noxious.  His right-side is plegic, though there may be some
stereotyped triple-flexion response in the right leg to noxious.

Formal testing is limited by language deficits.  Grimaces to
noxious throughout.

Reflexes:
Normoreflexic throughout, with an upgoing right toe.  Left toe
is downgoing.

Coordination and gait could not be assessed due to language
deficits and weakness.

CT HEAD:
1. Increased mean transit time in the left PCA distribution
which is
discordant with the patient's symptoms of right hemiparesis and
aphasia. The mean transit time maps are otherwise symmetric in
both cerebral hemispheres. Theoretically, considering the
patient's right ICA occlusion, a left MCA distribution ischemia
could be masked, however, is considered less likely. Normal
blood volume and permeability maps are noted.

2. Filling defect just distal to the origin of the left ICA,
presumably
representing intraluminal thrombus.

3. Occlusion of the right ICA as described above.

4. Unenhanced CT head images show no evidence of hemorrhage.

5. Post-surgical changes involving removal of left submandibular
gland.

MRI:
1. Moderate-sized acute infarctions of the predominantly left
PCA, left ACA, and left ACA-MCA and left PCA-MCA territories and
right cerebral hemisphere. Given the variable vascular
distribution possible etiologies for infarction include both
embolic and watershed phenomenon.

2. Foci of negative susceptibility in 2 of these areas on the
elft side can be due to old blood products. Stability can be
assessed at follow up study which can include post-contast
images to assess for any enahncement.


3. Stable occlusion of the right intracranial Internal carotid
artery, better evaluated on prior CTA and conventional
angiogram.

Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

No cardiac source of embolus identified (cannot definitively
exclude).


Brief Hospital Course:
73 year-old right-handed gentleman with a history of
hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, anxiety, and chronic
siadenitis of the left submandibular gland due to a stone, who
was noted to have right hemiplegia, language difficulties, and
right-sided neglect after a left submandibular resection.  There
was a concern of labile pressures with a brief period of
intra-operative hypotension.

His examination was notable for a non-fluent aphasia, with
impaired comprehension,
repetition, and naming.  There may be a component of mild
neglect of right visual space.  He had a right upper motor
neuron pattern facial droop and right hemiplegia.  There is
