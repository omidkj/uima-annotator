CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Seizure.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
African-American female with a history of primary seizure
disorder, alcohol abuse and medication noncompliance, who has
had multiple admissions for seizures in the context of
alcohol withdrawal or medical noncompliance with heavy
drinking.

As with many prior admissions, the patient was again brought
in after her husband found her lethargic on the morning of
the day of admission, possibly postictal.  The patient had
not been taking her antiseizure medications or insulin
according to her husband.  In the Emergency Department, the
patient had initially finger stick blood glucose or greater
than 400 and the anion gap was 26.  She was initiated on an
insulin drip but then suffered a tonic-clonic seizure which
broke with 2 mg of Ativan IM.

The patient stated that she had been feeling nauseous for the
past three days.  She thinks that she had a seizure at home
in the morning.  She also complained of dysuria and fevers
for the past three days.  The patient stated that she had
been compliant with her medications despite nausea.  She also
denied suicidal ideation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for loose stools, abdominal
pain, stated that this pain is without radiation, for the
past two days.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Primary seizure disorder.
2.  Alcohol abuse with withdrawal seizures.
3.  Hyponatremia.
4.  Type 2 diabetes.
5.  History of pancreatitis.
6.  Osteoporosis.
7.  Ethanol-induced hepatitis.
8.  Depression.
9.  Type 4 renal tubular acidosis.

ALLERGIES:  Glyburide.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE FROM [**Hospital6 **] ON [**2177-4-13**]:
1.  Phenytoin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Levothyroxine 1,000 b.i.d.
3.  Trazodone 150 q.h.s.
4.  Celexa 20 q.d.
5.  Nifedipine 90 p.o. q.i.d.

12. Multivitamin q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
100.3, blood pressure 149/88, heart rate 115, 02 saturation
99% on room air.  General:  The patient was awake, alert, and
oriented times three.  HEENT:  PERRL, EOMI, MMM.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac without murmurs.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities without edema.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.7, hematocrit 32,
platelet count 495,000.  BUN 23, creatinine 1.3, bicarbonate
13, glucose 286, anion gap 22.  Phenytoin levels:  0.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  SEIZURES:  The patient's seizures have
been caused by multiple factors including alcohol withdrawal,
noncompliance with antiepileptic medications for primary
seizure disorder, electrolyte imbalance due to poor
nutrition.  The patient was found to be with a subtherapeutic
phenytoin level on admission and she was reloaded.  Also, the
daily dose was increased to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d.  The
levothyroxine was maintained at 1,000 mg p.o. b.i.d.  The
patient also was treated with diazepam per CIWA scale.
Subsequently, the Diazepam was tapered off per protocol.

2.  ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCES:  The patient has had a chronic
history of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia which has been
attributed to RTA type 4.  The patient's hyperkalemia was
managed with p.r.n. administration of Kayexalate.  More over,
during this admission, the patient was started on Florinef
0.1 mg p.o. q.d.

3.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient was maintained on a regimen of
Nifedipine CR 90 mg p.o. q.d. and metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.  Lisinopril has been discontinued since her prior
admission, because of the concern for her type 4 RTA.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was found to have a UTI
on admission and was treated with a seven day course of
levofloxacin.  On [**2177-4-9**], the patient was noted to
have a temperature of 100.3 and had a low 02 saturation.
Also, the patient started complaining of a nonproductive
cough.

On [**2177-5-11**], the patient's T max was 101.7 and she was
started on antibiotic treatment (levofloxacin/Flagyl) for a
possible aspiration pneumonia.

5.  ALCOHOL ABUSE:  This is a chronic issue for which Social
Services and Psychiatry have been following the patient.  She
received Diazepam p.r.n per CIWA scale and then her Diazepam
was tapered off.  She has received thiamine, folate, and
multivitamins.

6.  DISPOSITION:  At this point, there are ongoing
discussions concerning the patient's disposition.  A possible
section 35 has been pursued, similarly to prior actions that
have been taken several years ago, which had obviously helped
the patient because she had remained sober for quite some
time.  At this point, these actions are still pending.  An
addendum will follow.
