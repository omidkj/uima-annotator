83 yo gentleman with little PMHx was admitted from ERCP suite
with history epigastric pain.

He was initially admitted to [**Hospital6 204**] (LGH) 10
days ago with acute on chronic epigastric pain and diagnosed
with pancreatitis. Additional review of systems is notable for
the following: intermittent epigastric pain and anorexia over
last 3-4 months. He denies fevers or jaundice. At LGH, labs were
notable for leukocytosis with WBC >20,000, increasing serum and
fluid amylase levels with serial fluid amylase readings of
[**2156**]-3600s. Imaging was notable for the following: abdominal CT
with peripancreatic and ascitic fluid; MRI which revealed an
amorphous pancreatic head suggestive of hemorrhagic
pancreatitis. A paracentesis was performed on [**2166-4-28**], and fluid
total protein was elevated, a SAAG was near zero, and fluid cell
count revealed WBC 1700 with neutrophilic predominance. For
treatment, he was started empirically on Unasyn on [**2166-4-26**] and
then changed to Zosyn on [**2166-4-29**]. He also had a drain placed
into one of his abdominal fluid collections. Additional issues
include the following:
- malnutrition - He was started on TPN in the setting of being
NPO and with marked hypoalbuminemia with Alb 1.5.
- anemia - He received 1 unit pRBCs.
- Atrial Fibrillation - He developed rapid afib on [**2166-4-29**]. He
was initially started on diltiazem with minimal improvement, and
he was then transitioned to amiodarone.  A pigtail drain was
placed [**2166-5-1**] to drain ascitic fluid.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Assessment for ERCP and possible
transpapillary drainage with stenting.  Finger stick glucose was
elevated to 225 this afternoon.

1. Edematous major papilla
2. The bile duct was not dilated. The distal bile duct filled
poorly, most likely due to extrinsic compression from the
pathology at the pancreatic head. No filling defects were noted.

3. Contrast was injected into the pancreatic duct, which
appeared to terminate abruptly in the pancreatic head, with no
filling b
