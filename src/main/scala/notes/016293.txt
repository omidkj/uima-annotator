Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line placement
CPR

History of Present Illness:
79 yo female with h/o CAD s/p CABG and PTCA in the past, HTN,
afib, systolic HF EF 20-25%, presents to ED with MS changes-
lethargy, and complaints of diarrhea and nausea. The stool was
guiaic negative per patient report. She denied fever or chills
while in the ED. Further history was unable to obtained at the
time of admission since patient was intubated and family was not
immediately available.

In the ED, vitals were 33.4 rectal, 86, 115/76, 16, 100%. Her ED
course was complicated and included developing respiratory
distress which eventually required intubation. She also
developed a wide complex tachycardia, which was evaluated by
cardiology who felt it was likely secondary to her acidosis.
During placement of her central line, she went into a pulseless
VT, and was given 200J shoch with return of her pulses. Given
her diarrhea, abdominal pain, severe acidosis and elevated
lactate, there was a concern for ischemic bowel. Both
non-contrast, and contrast CTs were obtained, without obvious
evidence of ischemia or pneumatosis. She also had a dirty UA,
and there was a concern for urosepsis. During her course, she
received 6L IVFs, and a right IJ was also placed. She did at one
point become hypotensive SBP to 80s despite IVFs, and she was
started on levophed since CVP was 12. The granddaughter, who is
the decision maker, was initially in the ED with the patient. A
pastor was called to the bedside, but at the time of transfer to
the MICU, the patient was FULL CODE.

Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2117-6-19**]):    NO GROWTH.

AP CHEST X-RAY: An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the
carina. An
enteric catheter courses through the esophagus to terminate in
the mid
stomach. The median sternotomy wires, prosthetic valve and
mediastinal clips
are unchanged. Heart size is markedly enlarged, unchanged.
Bilateral lung
hyperinflation and prominent interstitium is unchanged.
increased
interstitial prominence and Kerley B lines is new since [**Month (only) **].
There is no
consolidation, pneumothorax or effusion.

IMPRESSION: Stable severe cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload
that has
increased since [**Month (only) **] with satisfactory position of lines and
tubes.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases demonstrate
bibasilar
atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no
pericardial
effusion. Trace pleural effusions are noted.

On this non-contrast examination, the liver, and spleen are
unremarkable. A
mildly atrophic right kidney is noted. there is no evidence of
hydronephrosis
or mass. Small bilateral; adrenal nodules with Hounsfield
measurments less
than 10 are unchanged. There is a 5 mm gallstone without
evidence of
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation to suggest acute

cholecystitis. Pancreatic head and body atrophy are unchanged.
Periportal
edema is moderate. Two small subcentimeter well circumscribed
lesions in the
right kidney likely represent cysts, although are too small to
characterize.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The rectum, uterus, adnexa and
pelvic loops of
bowel are unremarkable. There is a trace amount of free fluid
noted. Foley
and rectal catheters are noted.

Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.


IMPRESSION:

1. Fluid filled small bowel without evidence of obstruction or
inflammatory
change.

2. Small bilateral stable adrenal adenomas.

3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

4. Extensive abdominal atherosclerotic changes.

NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass,
mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved throughout without evidence of
recent infarct. Bilateral subcortical and periventricular white
matter hypodensities represent chronic microvascular ischemia,
unchanged. Calcification along the cavernous carotid arteries as
well as the basal ganglia is unchanged. A small osteoma near the
right coronal suture is unchanged.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CT ABDOMEN: There are small bilateral effusions and associated
relaxation
atelectasis.

The right kidney demonstrates patchy hypodensities which may
represent acute
to subacute infarcts as the right kidney is moderatley decreased
in size but
not grossly atrophic. The left kidney is unremarkable. The liver
demonstrates
patchy enhancement which is likely related to right heart
failure. The spleen
is unremarkable. There is moderate perihepatic and periportal
ascites,
unchanged. This may be seen in patients recieving hydration. The
mesenteric
venous and venous structures appear patent. The intra- abdominal
loops of
small and large bowel are grossly unremarkable, without evidence
of
pneumatosis, free air or obstruction. The pancreatic head and
body are
atrophic, unchanged. Bilateral adrenal nodules measuring less
than 10
Hounsfield units are consistent wi
