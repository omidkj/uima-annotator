CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2179-2-19**] 10:04 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old woman s/p AVR/CABG/PFO closure
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after aortic valve
replacement, CABG and patent foramen ovale closure.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to [**2179-2-16**].

Patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of
the NG tube and Swan-Ganz catheter. The moderate cardiomegaly is
stable. The bibasal opacities are consistent with post-surgical
atelectasis, improved. Small amount of pleural effusion is
demonstrated, bilateral. There is no evidence of failure. There
is no pneumothorax.

Findings
Please this TEE was done on [**2179-2-9**] during the surgery
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the aortic arch. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderate AS (AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2) Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a moderate aortic regurgitation with moderate
aortic stenosis. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was notified of the findings in the operating room.

Post_Bypass:
Preserved biventricular normal systolic function. LVEF 55%.
Ascending aortic contour is well preserved.
Mild to Moderate regurgitation is seen.
There is a mechanical valve in the native aortic position,
stable and moving well with residual gradients of a peak of 12
and a mean of 5mm of Hg.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery for IV heparin after stopping
his coumadin in preparation for surgery. He was taken to the
operating room on [**2-9**] where he underwent a CABG x 2 and AVR. He
was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. He was extubated
on POD #1. He was transfused. He returned to rate controlled
atrial fibrillation. He was started on coumadin for his
mechanical valve and afib. He developed complete heart block and
was seen by electroph
