and cocaine.  Pt was reportedly hypotensive (SBP 90) and
tachycardic in the field.  PT was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and found
to have a GCS of 15.  He had multiple facial fractures (anterior
and posterior frontal sinus fx with pneumocephalus, bilateral
maxillary sinus and orbital fractures) on CT.  CT of
chest/abd/pelvis was negative.  He did complain of bilateral arm
tingling which progressed to paresis.  CT C-spine showed rotary
subluxation of C1-2 as well as blood in the upper cervical
spinal
canal.  Pt became acutely bradycardic with heart rate down to
the
30's and was intubated.  Pt was then taken to MRI for C-spine
MRI
and neck MRA.

43 yo male s/P MVC vs tree +etoh/marijuana/cocaine. pt with
multiple facial fractrues, subluxation of C1/c2 and epidural
hematoma in cerival spical canal. pt s/p decompression and
evacuation of hematoma. failed trial of extubation on [**2144-10-21**];
pt with elevated temperature +sputum cx of n. menigitidis rx
with vanc/levo/CTX. noted persistently elevated temp per team.
Started on broad spectrum antibiotics in TSICU for persistent
