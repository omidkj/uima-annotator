Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to to [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department on
[**2167-8-11**] with complaints of pleuritic chest pain x 1-2 days. In
the ED, a CT chest/abd showed multiple bilateral pulmonary
emboli, WBC 13.9, Hct 38.1, LFTs and lytes WNL, D-dimer 2661,
and CXR with bibasilar opacities - possible atelectasis. The
patient was started on IV heparin and transferred to the ICU for
respiratory management - requiring nasal cannula at 4L to
maintain O2 saturations above 92%. Lower extremity dopplers
negative for thrombi. On HD 2, she was transferred to a regular
floor for further management of PTT and bridging to coumadin.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout the
hospitalization; pain was well controlled with a dilaudid PCA
initially, and later transitioned to PO dilaudid and tylenol at
time of discharge.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient required oxygen supplementation via nasal
cannula to maintain O2 sat above 92% until HD 3, at which time
she was transitioned to room air. Vital signs were routinely
monitored.
HEME: The patient was intially started on heparin IV and
maintained at goal PTT 60-90 with PTT checks every 6 hours.
Heparin was discontinued on discharge. Coumadin was started on
HD 4 with INR checks to maintain INR goal [**2-13**]. The patient was
therapeutic in this range on 3mg coumadin daily at discharge.
GI/GU/FEN: She was maintained on a bariatric stage 4 diet once
stable and out of the ICU. The diet was well-tolerated.
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored.
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of
infection, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and [**Last Name (un) **]
dyne boots were used during this stay; s/he was encouraged to
get up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
