Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization with placement of Drug Eluting Stent to
proximal LAD

History of Present Illness:
48M with a history of hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH with
chest pain found to have occlusion of LAD now s/p proximal LAD
stenting.  The patient was in his usual state of health until
last evening when he developed severe chest pain while
exercising on an elliptical trainer at the gym.  Pt states that
he has had both right and left shoulder pain in the past but has
not thought to associate that this with a cardiac etiology.
Last night, the pain was more severe than ever before, the
patient rates it a [**8-3**].  After he returned [**Last Name (un) **] from the gym, he
continued to have the chest pain so he called EMS and was
brought to an OSH.
.
At the OSH, initial vitals 113/68 93 18 98% on 3L.  The patient
was given SL nitro and morphine with improvement of his symptoms
but not resolution.  EKG notable for ST segment depressions in
V3-V5.  This morning, he was transferred from the OSH to [**Hospital 61**] for positive cardiac markers and ongoing pain.  Per
report, Pt bolused started on heparin and integrilin drips and
received 600mg Plavix, 25mg lopressor and 325mg aspirin prior to
transfer.  CTA performed and negative for PE or other acute
intrathoracic process.
.
On arrival, vitals BP 106/78 HR 90.  Cardiac cath showed 100%
occlusion of the LAD.  A thrombectomy was performed with partial
removal of the occluding thrombus.  A Cypher, drug-eluting stent
was placed in the mid LAD.   PTCA of the diagonal was performed
with recurrent thrombus.  The patient was plavix loaded at the
OSH and started on integrelin in the cath lab.  The patient was
noted to have an elevated wedge pressure at 30 for which he
received 20mg IV lasix.  Because the patient was uable to void,
a Foley catheter was placed with 1100 cc urine output.
.
On arrival to the CCU, vitals 98.4 109/58 86 95%2L.  Patient
chest pain free.  Denied any shortness of breath, palpitations,
or shoulder pain but did not feeling of severe gastric reflux.
.
ROS:  As per HPI.  In addition, back pain from lying flat.
Occasional dry cough, dry mouth, dysuria and occasional right
knee pain.

Cardiac cath ([**3-31**]):
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 5 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 5 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French left [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
thrombectomy.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring

PTCA COMMENTS:     Initail angiography revealed a proximally
occluded
LAD. We planned to treat this with PTCA and stenting. A 6 french
XB 3.5
guide provided good support for the procedure. Heparin,
integrilin,
aspirin and plavix were used as anticoagulation. A prowater wire
crossed
into the distal LAD with minimal difficulty. Thrombectomy was
performed
with an export catheter with minimal success. A 2.5 x 15 mm
balloon
dottered through the stenosis with minimal effect. A 5 French
temporary
pacing wire was inserted  and thrombectomy with the angiojet was

perfoemd with moderate success. Angiography then revealed a
proximal LAD
stenosis involving the diagonal and thrombus in both the LAD and
the
diagonal. Another prowater wire was directed down the diagonal
and
angioplasty was performed in the diagonal with a 2.0 x 12 mm
voyager
balloon at 10 ATM. A 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher [**Last Name (un) **] was deployed in the
LAD at
18 ATM after removing the D1 wire. A choice floppy wire was then

redirected down the D1 adn the diagonal and LAD were dilated in
a
kissing fashion with a 2.0 x 12 mm quantum maverick in the
diagonal and
a 3.0 x 15 mm quantum maverick in the LAD at 10 ATM. Angiography
then
revealed recurrent thrombus in the LAD and diagonal.
Thrombectomy wasu
The diagonal was thenr edilated with a 2.0 x 12 mm balloon at 16
and teh
LAD was post dilated with a 3.25 x 15 mm quantum maverick
balloon at 20
ATM. There was a hazy opacity that persisted in the LAD stent
and IC
reopro was administered with little change. The LAD stent was
then post
dilated with a 3.25 x 15 mm powersail and a 3.5 x 15 mm
powersail
balloon at 20 ATM x multiple inflations. Final angiography
revealed
minor residual thrombus in the LAD stent and slow flow and
thrombus in
the D1 without a dissection.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of thsi right dominant system
revealed
single vessel CAD. The LMCA had no nobstructive CAD. The LAD was

proximally occluded. The LCX had no angiographically visible
obstructive
lesions. The RCA was a dominant vessel without angiographically
obstructive CAD.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left and
right sided
filling pressures and a reduced cardiac index of 1.8 L/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the LAD with a
3.0 x 23
mm cypher [**Last Name (un) **] which was postdilated with a 3.5 x 15 mm powersail
balloon
at high pressure. Final an
