Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2148-8-12**] - Cardiac Catheterization
[**2148-8-16**] - Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting to four vessels. (Left
internal mammary->Left anterior descending artery, Saphenous
vein graft(SVG)->Diagonal artery, SVG->Obtuse marginal artery,
SVG->Posterior descending artery).


History of Present Illness:
68 yo male with history of cardiac arrest in [**1-2**] s/p
resuscitation, cooling and cath showing 3-vessel disease but not
candidate for PCI/CABG now with an AICD brought in by ambulance
after sudden onset chest pain with shortness of breath. Mr.
[**Known lastname 31251**] had recently returned home from work, just eaten dinner,
and was with his family watching a movie when he suddenly felt a
sharp epigastric pain which he thought was indigestion.  A cough
developed with no productive sputum. He tried some soda water
which typically helps him but the pain continued to progress.
The patient got more short of breath, diaphoretic, and became
nauseous and vomited once.  He also became quite anxious.  The
pain ranged from [**2-4**] to [**7-4**], getting progressively worse until
the ambulance arrived.  The pain was midline, substernal and did
not radiate down either arm or into his neck or jaw, and it was
not focused on either side.  He was given an aspirin,
nitroglycerin (4x SL), lasix 80mg IV, morphine 4mg IV prior to
arrival to the ED.  Patient's pacemaker was recently
interrogated on Monday and settings were altered.  The patient
notes that he has had two similar, but less severe, episodes of
pain over the last two months that he attributed to indigestion.
 He also reports weight gain of [**11-8**] lbs over the last few
months, but states that he's been adhering to a good diet.
.
On arrival to the ED his vital signs were HR:60s BP:112/60
O(2)Sat:96 on NRB and his chest pain had completely resolved but
he was still reporting shortness of breath. EKG showed sinus
tachycardia with some PVCs.  He was noted to have bibasilar
rales on exam.  The patient was briefly started on BiPAP.
.
On arrival to the floor the patient was comfortable and in no
acute distress. He remained chest pain free and felt that his
shortness of breath was improving throughout the night.  He
currently has no complaints and feels back to baseline.  The
patient reports no orthopnea, PND, or recent leg swelling.

ECG on admission: Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes. Compared to tracing #1
the rate is slower and there are now criteria for poor R wave
progression. Ventricular ectopy is not seen.

Preop Echocardiogram [**2148-8-13**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Pre-operative chest X-ray: Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
Improvement of pulmonary vascularengorgement. No pleural
effusions. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Unchanged course of the pacemaker leads.

Pre-operative carotid series:
There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
There is antegrade left vertebral artery flow.
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis <40% .

[**2148-8-12**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography limited to the left sided
circulation
in this left dominant coronary system revealed 2 vessel coronary
artery
disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparant disease. The
LAD had
a 70% proximal stenosis and a diffuse 50% stenosis in the mid
vessel.
The mid and distal LAD were small in caliber. The Cx had a long
80%
proximal stenosis. A tiny OM1 was 99% occluded at its origin.
There was
a 60% stenosis at the bifurcation of the OM2. There was a 50%
stenosis
in the left PDA. The nondominant RCA is known to be small in
caliber and
non-dominant and was not evaluated during this left heart
catheterization.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal central aortic
pressures. There
was elevation in the left sided filling pressure (LVEDP 32mmHg).

3. Left ventriculography revealed no valvular regurgitation. The

calculated EF was 52%. There was akinesis of the apex and
hypokinesis of th mid and distal inferior walls.
