Brief Hospital Course:
70M with nausea and vomiting with acute on chronic incarcerated
massive scrotoinguinal hernia. He was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**]
surgical service on [**2158-7-3**]. A nasogastric tube placed and
patient resuscitated. Nasogastric output ~ 2L/day with feculent
material. Patient continue to deny surgery. Health care proxy,
psychiatry, and legals were involved in his care as he was
deemed incapable of making any decisions. Finally, with all
groups in consent and patient's agreement and  lack of clinical
progress, he was taken to the operating room on [**2158-7-7**] for an
exploratory laparotomy and hernia repair. A triple lumen CVL was
placed.

Postop, taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring and was
extubated on postop day 1, but required aggressive pulmonary
toilet. CXR demonstrated lower lobe collapse. He was hypotensive
(sbp in 80s)and required neo. PRBC were given for a low hct of
23. Albumin was given, but he required Levophed as well.
Tachycardia was noted with a drop in hct. More PRBC were
administered. Hct stablized. EKG was normal. Pressors were
weaned. Sinus tach with frequent PAC was treated with iv
metoprolol.  Non invasive ventilation was required for
respiratory status.  NG was draining bilious fluid. Vancomycin
was given postop x2 for coverage due to hernia repair with mesh.
This was stopped.

He was transferred out of the SICU once improved. The NG was
removed on [**7-12**] after clamping trials were tolerated. Diet was
slowly advanced and poorly tolerated. Intake was fair and
supplements were ordered. A dobhoff was placed, but the patient
self removed. TPN was started. He was passing stool via a
Flexiceal. On [**7-14**], he experienced a vasovagal episode during a
BM. No further events or treatments were required.

Flexiceal was removed on [**7-6**]. Foley catheter was removed on [**7-19**]
without incident. Vital signs were stable. He did continue to
require oxygen as he would desat to 87% on room air. Abdominal
incision was intact with staples. The lower portion of the
incision had small amounts of tannish drainage, but no redness.
The surrounding areas lateral to the incision initially had a
mottled appearance that evolved to ecchymosis. These areas
lightened up. The JP was left in place as outputs were initially
high. Outputs decreased, but were still ~ 110ml/day as of [**7-20**].
Fluid was sero-sanguinous. He received minimal pain medication.
His affect was calm and cooperative. TPN was stopped and the CVL
was removed on [**7-20**].

PT evaluated him and recommended rehab. A bed was available at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
