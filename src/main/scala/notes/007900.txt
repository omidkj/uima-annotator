Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ and Swan-Ganz catheter placed

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 31 yo with pmh significant for pulmonary hypertension,
active Heroin use, HIV, Hepatitis C, seizures related to heroin
use, recent MRSA soft tissue infection, who presented to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from direct transfer from OSH ED where had nl wbc count but
40% bands, hypotension to systolic of 50's requiring Levophed,
elevated AST, ALT, T.Bili, RUQ ultrasound showing edematous
thickened GB but no stones or CBD dilation.  Pt was presumed to
have acute cholangitis, and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent ERCP.
During a recent hospitalization from which she was discharged
one week prior, she was found to have elevated AST and ALT
(isolated) which was thought due to either shock liver or toxin
(drugs or medications).  RUQ pain radiates from just right of
the xiphoid process along the costal margin to the back.  No
alleviating or exacerbating symptoms.  No cp, sob, cough, ha,
fever, diarrhea, constipation.

CT abd/chest/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly limited examination for pulmonary embolus due to
suboptimal bolus timing, with no pulmonary embolus identified.
2. Extensive bilateral pulmonary parenchymal consolidation and
bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with diffuse infectious
process.
3. Small pericardial effusion. Contrast refluxes into the
hepatic veins and IVC, consistent with right heart failure.
4. Anasarca and ascites.
5. No definite infectious source visualized in the abdomen.

U/S Abdomen:
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder
wall thickening and echogenicity, consistent with AIDS
cholangiopathy. No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. If there is persistent clinical concern, a HIDA scan
could be performed for further evaluation.
2) Enlarged and echogenic kidneys, consistent with HIV
nephropathy.
3) Small amount of ascites, not sufficient to mark for tap.
4) Small right pleural effusion.
5) Limited Doppler examination of the liver is grossly
unremarkable.

Blood Culture at OSH: 4/4 bottles with pneumoncoccus


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and placed on vasopressors. She was found to be
septic with high wbc count, bandemia, hypotension, tachycardia,
hyperthermia, and blood cultures from OSH found to be positive
for pneumococcus. Pt was treated with broad antibiotic coverage
upon arrival. Repeat abdominal ultrasound with doppler at [**Hospital1 18**]
again showed no sign of bile duct obstruction and no portal
hypertension.  Further review of the abdomen showed elevated
LFTs which trended down, thought secondary to shock liver vs.
effects of toxins.  In work-up of abdominal pain there was no
abscess, no significant ascites.  CT scan of chest showed no PE,
was positive for pneumonia. As patient continued to be
hypotensive on vasopressors, a swan-ganz catheter was placed and
she was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension with
systolic pulmonary artery pressure in 150's.  A nitrous oxide
inhalation trial was without response. The patient had increased
work of breathing and eventually required intubation for
respiratory exhaustion.  After several days of worsening heart
failure and elevated pulmonary hypertension the patient had a
cardiopulmonary arrest with PEA and despite efforts to
resuscitate, died.
