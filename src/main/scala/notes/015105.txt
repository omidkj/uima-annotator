Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right subtrochanteric femoral fracture repair with
intramedullary nail


History of Present Illness:
86yoF with h/o tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, AFib on
Coumadin/Amiodarone, chronic systolic dysfunction (EF 40% in
[**2123**]), CRI who presents with acute onset of diarrhea.
.
Pt and family ate chicken fried rice last night and then Friday
1am had sudden onset diarrhea (yellow, watery, not foul
smelling, not bloody, not meleanotic, no f/c/sweats, no n/v, no
abd pain). She had 10 episodes of diarrhea through the day.
Similar complaints in her daughter who also ate the same meal,
but less severity--only 2 episodes of diarrhea. No recent ABx or
travel. She got 2 doses of Imodium from her daughter which
helped.
.
In the ED initial VS: 98.2 60 140/57 16 100. Her labs showed
WBC's 8.5, CBC o/w normal, lipase 22, LFT's normal except very
slight increase AST 49 (new), low HCO3 at 18 (new), BUN newly
mildly elevated 23, Cr 1.2 actually lower than her baseline. K
initially high but hemolyzed, repeated were normal.
.
In the ED she c/o R hip pain with ambulation x1 week, no pain
while seated or at rest, no trauma or falls, not red or swollen.
She was tender under R greater trochanter and R trochanteric
bursitis was suspected. She got Depomedrol 40mg in 1% Lidocaine
injection into R bursa. Of note, she is followed at [**Hospital1 18**] Rheum
and has gotten steroid injections in her bilateral knees for OA,
most recently this month.
.
She was started on her first L of NS in the ED and PO fluids
were encouraged.
.
Before transfer from the ED: temp 97, p70 120/72 16 99%RA. She
is admitted for rehydration. On the floor she is without R hip
pain.
.
ROS:
(+) Per HPI
(-) for SOB, CP, BLE edema, palpitations, otherwise denies any
other symptoms, negative for all other major organ systems.

      This test does not reliably detect Cryptosporidium,
Cyclospora or
      Microsporidium. While most cases of Giardia are detected
by routine
      O+P, the Giardia antigen test may enhance detection when
organisms
      are rare.

Studies:
[**8-27**] CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly and elongated tortuous aorta are
stable. Left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in standard
position in the right atrium and right ventricle. There is no
pulmonary edema. The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.

[**8-28**] Right Hip U/S: 1. No focal collection or hematoma
identified at the site of palpable abnormality. 2. Small focus
of ecchymosis in the right upper thigh, with an oblong
hypoechoic structure seen directly subjacent to the ecchymosis,
likely reflecting a tiny hematoma presumably related to recent
injection.

[**8-29**] CT Pelvis: There is a proximal diaphyseal comminuted
fracture of the right femur, with varus angulation, proximal and
medial displacement of the distal fracture fragment. There is
approximately 9 cm overlap of the fracture fragments. The
proximal fracture fragment is laterally angulated, and likely
accounts for palpable findings. There is no underlying bone
lesion. No additional fractures are identified.

The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized, limiting
evaluation for
nondisplaced fractures.

There is multifactorial spinal canal stenosis at the L5-S1
level, incompletely evaluated on this non-dedicated study. There
are degenerative changes of both sacroiliac joints. There is a
tiny sclerotic density in the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] (2:27), probably
representing a small bone island.

Mild degenerative changes are noted at both femoroacetabular
joints, with
osteophyte formation. There are mild degenerative changes at the
symphysis
pubis.

There is marked expansion of the right thigh's muscles about the
fracture
site, consistent with presence of an intramuscular hematoma in
the quadriceps group and adductor compartment. Additionally,
there is soft tissue stranding involving the right lateral
thigh, incompletely evaluated, but may represent hematoma.

Incidentally noted are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications
of the
abdominal aorta and iliac vessels, which are normal in caliber.
There is
calcification adjacent to the posterior uterus, likely
representing calcified fibroids. There is no free pelvic fluid
and no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Displaced comminuted right femoral proximal diaphyseal
fracture with
adjacent intramuscular large hematoma.

2. Generalized demineralization, limiting evaluation for
nondisplaced
fractures.

[**8-31**] Echo: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. Mild
aortic and mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Diastolic function indices are equivocal,
but given the dilated left atrium and pulmonary hypertension,
diastolic dysfunction is likely.

[**9-4**] Knee plain films:  In comparison with the study of [**2127-7-10**],
there is continued severe degenerative change primarily
involving the medial and femoropatellar compartments but with
substantial spurring laterally as well. No acute abnormality is
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo F with h/o tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, AFib on
Coumadin/Amiodarone, chronic systolic dysfunction (EF 40% in
[**2123**]), CRI, HTN who presents with acute onset of diarrhea and R
hip pain x1 week. [**Hospital **] hospital course by problem is as
follows:
