History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 65107**] is a 75 year-old woman with COPD, mild
bronchiectasis and suspected vocal cord dysfunction admitted
[**12-25**] from [**Hospital3 **] to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital with PNA/Septic
Shock. Patient met SIRS criteria on admission and received EGDT
with 4L NS, 2 units PRBC and was transiently on norepinephrine.
She was also started on Vanc,Zosyn,Aztreonam on [**12-25**]. Sputum
culture grew ESBL E.Coli and MRSA and she was narrowed to
Vanc/Ertapenem. Patient required intubation on resentation and
was extubated on [**12-28**]. Following extubation she required
non-invasive ventillation intermittently throughout the day. The
patient's daughter subsequently requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is somnolent but eaily
awakes to touch and has expiratory stridor.

ECHO [**2167-12-31**]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

CT Chest [**2168-3-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Multicystic abnormality in the left lung apex, likely
pneumatoceles, not significantly changed since [**2168-2-22**].
2. Small left pneumothorax.
3. New left lower lobe pneumonia and accompanying nonhemorrhagic
pleural
effusion.
4. Diffuse bilateral bronchial wall thickening, mucoid
impaction, and
bronchiectasis, likely reflect chronic recurrent aspiration.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 75 year old woman with PMH of COPD,
tracheobronchomalacia, bronchiectasis, diastolic CHF,
Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary colonization, recent MRSA
and ESBL E.coli cavitary pneumonia, and DM2 who was transferred
from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for further management of HCAP/sepsis,
ultimately requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement with course
complicated by multiple pneumothoraces requiring several chest
tube placements.
.
#.  Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated on admission to
[**Hospital 8**] Hospital and was extubated there on [**2168-12-28**] before
being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  She has a diagnosis of COPD and is
likely hypercarbic at baseline.  She had audible expiratory
stridor on admission exam and required non-invasive ventilation
after admission to the MICU.  She then developed increased work
of breathing and was re-intubated at [**Hospital1 18**].  Bronchoscopy was
done and showed severe distal tracheal malacia and severe
bilateral main bronchi malacia.  A tracheostomy was performed
[**1-6**].  She was given a prednisone taper, saline and albuterol
nebs, and her HCAP was treated as below.  She requires
intermittent PSV ventilation, but has been tolerating trach
collar for prolonged periods of time recently.
.
#. Multiple left sided pneumothoraces:  She developed a left
sided pneumothorax on [**1-7**] and chest tube was placed.  She
developed multiple left sided pneumothoraces throughout her
hospital course requiring several chest tubes.  She was
pleurodesed by the thoracic surgeons on [**2168-3-15**] and the chest
tube removed, but she developed a repeat pneumothorax requiring
a pig tail chest tube placed.  Thoracics initially recommended a
repeat pleurodesis, but the daughter declined given that her
mother experienced a lot of pain after her first one.  Her last
chest tube was removed [**2168-3-24**].  She should be monitored closely
for any further pneumothoraces.
.
#. HCAP/Sepsis: Patient presented to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital in
severe sepsis requiring aggressive care.  Sputum culture grew
ESBL E.Coli and MRSA.  She was continued on a course of
vancomycin and meropenem.  BAL grew aspergillus and she was
given a course of voriconazole.  She developed several
ventilator associated pneumonias throughout her course requiring
multiple extended courses of meropenem for continued ESBL E.
Coli in her sputum samples, but no MRSA or aspergillus.  Her
most recent 21 day course of meropenem ended [**2168-3-25**] and she is
currently on inhaled colistin to suppress any future infections.

.
#. Positive sputum AFB/Mycobacterium avium complex:  A sputum
sample from [**2167-12-29**] was AFB positive.  She was placed on
tuberculosis precautions for two months while the sample was
sent to the state lab for speciation.  Her quantiferon gold was
negative.  Speciation revealed atypical mycobacteria,
respiratory precautions were discontinued, and no further
treatment was pursued.
.
#. Diastolic CHF: Patient has known CHF on Lasix and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] as
an outpatient. Her [**Last Name (un) **] has been held and her Lasix is currently
dosed at 20mg IV BID with a goal of keeping her ins/outs even as
she currently appears euvolemic.
.
#. Diabetes Mellitus: Her blood sugars were checked four times
daily and she was mai
