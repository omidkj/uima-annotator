Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred for hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mechanical intubation

History of Present Illness:
75F with hx of stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung ca treated with
chemoradiation, taxol/carboplatin, followed by right
pneumonectomy, recent squamous cell ca of the skin s/p radiation
of the chest, initially presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with
anuria found to have Cr 8.5, hypotension requiring pressors, now
with improving renal function and hemodynamics but worsening
hypoxia.
.
Per pt and OSH dc summary, pt presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital
[**2161-2-26**] complaining of anuria x3 days, diarrhea x 3-4 days,
nausea and poor appetite. She was found to have a Cr 8.5, K 5.9.
At that time she denied NSAID use, pain, fevers, CP. She did
endorse baseline dyspnea worsened over the past couple months
(thought subsequent to radiation of resected squamous cell ca of
the skin overlying the manubrium in [**Month (only) 1096**]), but denied a home
O2 requirement.
.
At [**Name (NI) 1562**] Hospital, pt was initially hypotensive. She was
admitted to the ICU where she received IVF for [**Last Name (un) **] and
kayexelate for hyperkalemia, and was started on Levophed which
was switched to vasopressin, pressors dced [**2161-3-1**]. She was also
given stress doses of steroids but after ACTH stim test was
negative, was started on hydrocortisone taper. Metronidazole was
started empirically for diarrhea but dced after cdiff cx
negative. Renal u/s was done without hydronephrosis. Over the
course of admission, cr improved to 2.7. However, the pt
developed an O2 requirement and mild dyspnea with increased
interstitial marking in the L lung (while BNP was 400). ECHO on
levophed showed EF 80% with hyperdynamic LV and RV. VQ scan was
done which was neg for PE and B LENIs were neg for DVT. Diuresis
was initiated with lasix. The pt was started on CTX/Azithro on
[**3-1**] though no infiltrate was found, and no fever/cough/sputum
production reported. Despite these measures, O2 requirement
continued to increase. On discussions with the family it seems
she has been increasingly short of breath at home which has
limited her exertion significantly. Of note, the pt also has a
hx of tachyarrhythmias with episodes of SVT which were
reportedly treated with IV dilt and metop during admission.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the pt was sitting comfortabely in bed,
satting low 90s on 100% shovel mask. She denies dyspnea, n/v,
lightheadedness/cp. She does endorse some continued loose
stools. She is somewhat confused, perseverating on issues that
are out of context and not directly answering questions. Knows
she is in a hospital but not that it is [**Hospital3 **].
.
Initial labs at [**Hospital1 18**] showed: WBC 12.4, HCT 32.4, PLT 239. IRN
1.2.

IMAGING:
[**2161-3-4**] CT head IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. If
clinical suspicion for infarction or mass lesion is high, MRI is
the recommended study of choice.
.
[**2161-3-4**] CT chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild and diffuse ground-glass opacity in the left and small
left pleural effusion is likely due to pulmonary edema.
2. Right post-pneumonectomy space is stable, No evidence to
suggest local or regional recurrence.
3. Left hilus is more prominent since [**2157-4-24**] and is
contributed by left
main pulmonary artery (similar in caliber to prior study) and
nodular opacity laterally, likely an engorged pulmonary vein or
potentially lymph node.
4. Mild malacic of lower trachea and left main bronchus.
Following diuresis, repeat chest radi
