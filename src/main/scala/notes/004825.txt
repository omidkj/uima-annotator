Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Quinidine / Propranolol / Heparin Agents / Warfarin / Zolpidem

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14961**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, hip fracture, renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left ORIF [**2141-4-7**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF
65% 1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN,
who presented from acute rehab after falling at his nursing
home.  Yesterday he had been feeling well, walking with PT
(using a walker) and feeling well. Today he was reaching onto a
shelf for batteries when he turned too quickly and twisted his
left foot under him, falling on his left side and left arm. He
was sent from rehab to the ED.  On exam, his hip was externally
rotated and shortened.  He had no other complaints and denied
loss of consciousness or hitting his head on the fall.  Hct was
29.6 at rehab, Na 142, K 4.0, BUN 51, Creat 2.1, WBC 6.8, Plt
215.
.
In the ED, triage vs were: T 96.3 P 60 BP 107/62 R 16 O2 sat 96%
on RA, but he was then found to have systolic BP of 83-90s on
exam. He had good peripheral pulses.  He was evaluated for
trauma and plain films of the left hip and femur were completed,
showing multiple comminuted fractures for which the patient
would need a THR.  CT C-spine showed no fracture or
malalignment, and moderate multilevel degenerative change on
preliminary read. CT head without contrast showed no fracture or
hemorrhage (preliminary read).
.
The patient was given 1L IVF and fentanyl 100 mcg for pain. His
SBPs persisted in the 80s/90s. His Hct was found to be 24, down
[**4-3**] points. CT ab/pelvis was performed in the setting of the Hct
drop, showing left hip intertrochanteric fracture, a large
retroperitoneal mass likely from left adrenal gland (non-urgent
MR recommended for further evaluation), and no retroperitoneal
hematoma on preliminary read. He was found to be guaiac
negative. He continued with HR in 60s and systolics in 90s,
received an additional 1L IVF (and a second liter was begun
prior to transfer), and was typed and crossed for 2 units pRBC.
CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity and he was given levofloxacin
750 mg for empiric pneumonia coverage after a single blood
culture was drawn. A Foley was placed. Transfer vitals in the ED
were HR 64, RR19 100% on 4L (desatted after NS to low 90s),
88/48.
.
The patient was admitted to the MICU, where initial vitals were
HR 69 BP 102/63-120/75, RR 32-20, SpO2 100% on 1L NC.
.
On ROS, the patient denies any LOC, dizziness/lightheadedness,
recent diarrhea (though had diarrhea in prior admission). +cough
with small amounts of yellowish sputum but not in past few days.
No fevers.

-Hemorrhoid repair
-History of MRSA cellulitis ([**2-7**])
-Chronic Renal Failure [**1-31**] poor forward flow from CHF: Stage IV
with eGFR of 24 ml/min (MDRD). Near dialysis. Recommend to check
PTH every 3 months with target of 70-110.
-Left foot abscess s/p I&D
-Multiple episodes of C. Diff colitis (third episode this year
during [**3-17**] hospitalization)

Recent hospitalizations:
[**2140-12-29**] to [**2141-1-4**]
-- for CHF exacerbation, given lasix ggt
-- left foot cellulitis/fluid collection managed medically with
Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl
-- AFib subtherapeutic on Coumadin so bridged with Heparin with
subsequent rectal bleeding, traumatic hematoma, oozing from
newly placed PICC line
-- incidentaloma seen in pancreas on RUQ u/s without further w/u
.
[**2141-1-31**] to [**2141-2-15**]
-- also for CHF exacerbation, given lasix ggt and metolazone
-- supratherapeutic INR on admission, complicated by epistaxis
and melena (GI followed but endoscopy was deferred)
-- C diff colitis treated with ? both Po flagyl and vancomycin,
course should have been completed [**2141-2-19**]
.
[**2141-3-7**] to [**2141-3-10**]
-- Unresponsive while sleeping after trazadone; negative
infectious work up
-- 16 beat run of VT
-- Decreased metoprolol from 12.5mg->6.25mg [**Hospital1 **]
-- Renal failure attributed to torsemide and pre-renal
.
[**2141-3-17**] to [**2141-3-31**]
-- Sent in by rehab for sleepiness, low Hct, weight gain, cough.
-- C. Diff colitis
-- GIB (Guaiac positive, had been on coumadin until [**Month (only) 956**]
when had presumed UGIB requiring 1U pRBC); transfused for Hct
23.5 (but near baseline of 24)
-- Hypotension to the 70s systolic (baseline 90-100s)
-- CHF
-- UTI
-- Acute on chronic kidney disease
-- Pancytopenia: found to be HIT antibody positive but serotonin
assay negative so not likely HIT; nonetheless heparin products
were avoided. Pancytopenia improved over hospital course;
thought to be infection related.
-- Increased AP and GGT with elevated lipase and an abnormality
on ultrasound suggestive of a pancreatic mass. GI was consulted
and recommended an outpatient MRCP.
