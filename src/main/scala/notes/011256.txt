Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness and aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG placement per interventional radiology - self discontinued.


History of Present Illness:
78 F with hx AF, recently stopped coumadin 7 days ago for a
R-mastectomy and was supposed to re-start it tomorrow, hx prior
stroke in mid-90's (daugher unclear how it manifested, possibly
as R-weakness, but remembers that it was mild and resolved
completely), HTN, and COPD, was last seen normal at 9 pm last
night, and was found by family members this morning slumped to
the right and unable to produce speech. She was taken to
[**Hospital3 4298**] Hosp where NIHSS was rated as 16, and she
received a NCHCT c/w a L-MCA infarct. She was intubated
electively for airway protection and subsequently sedated. Per
her daughter's report, she was moving her left side normally,
and was able to
understand speech and follow commands, however was unable to
produce any words.

                        >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.

CT HEAD ([**3-11**]): 1. Subtle findings suggestive of left MCA
infarct, including loss with insular ribbon and vanishing basal
ganglia. Equivocal density within the left MCA may represent a
thrombus. An MRI is recommended to confirm these findings. No
evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

MRI/A of HEAD and NECK:
1. Large left MCA territory acute infarction. There is no
significant midline shift.  There is no hemorrhagic
transformation.

2. MRA of the neck demonstrates no hemodynamically significant
stenosis.

3. MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates lack of flow in the
distal petrous, proximal cavernous, supraclinoid ICA, left MCA
and left proximal ACA likely on a thromboembolic basis.

TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
basal anterior wall, mid to distal anterior wall and anterior
septum. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Sub-optimal image quality due to tachycardia, atrial
fibrillation and poor echo windows. No cardiac source of
embolism seen. No ASD or PFO seen but cannot exclude on the
basis of this study. Mild to moderate focal LV systolic
dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 78 F with  hx AF, recently stopped coumadin 7 days
ago for a R-mastectomy and was supposed to re-start it tomorrow,
hx prior stroke in mid-90's (daugher unclear how it manifested,
possibly as R-weakness, but remembers that it was mild and
resolved completely), HTN, and COPD, was found this morning
slumped to R and unable to produce speech with NCHCT c/w a
possible L-MCA infarct.  Most likely source of the infarct is
cardio-embolic in light of her recent Coumadin holiday.

Patient was intubated while at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital before her
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  She was admitted to the ICU and MRI/A showed
a large L MCA distribution stroke and given large infarct, she
was not bridged with heparin drip for risk of hemorrhagic
transformation.  She was restarted on her home Coumadin dose and
ASA for bridging until therapeutic.

She was extubated on HD#2 but within several hours, developed
increased sputum with respiratory distress hence re-intubated
and sputum culture initially grew 3+ GNR and 1+ GPCs plus
leukocytosis with WBC up to 16K hence broad antibiotics of
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started which was switched to
ampicillin-sulbactam once H.influenzae was isolated on [**3-15**].
Last day of ABX was [**3-19**].

Patient was successfully extubated on [**3-15**] afternoon but patient
required frequent suctioning for poor handling of secretions.
She also failed speech and swallow evaluation on [**3-16**] which was
repeated on [**3-20**] given that patient was only recently extubated.

Also, on HD #3, patient was found to have tachycardia hence EKG
was obtained which showed no acute change but cardiac enzymes
were elevated hence most consistent with NSTEMI.  Cardiology was
consulted who recommended medical management including rate
control with metoprolol and adding digoxin.  Her Coumadin was
stopped and she was started on Lovenox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] instead also in
anticipation for possible PEG placement during this admission.
Her CPK peaked in the 200's then trended down.

Patient was then transferred to the step down unit.  Repeat
swallow evaluation again resulted in recommendations for strict
NPO hence IR was consulted for PEG placement.  She was planned
for PEG on [**3-21**] but her coag panel showed elevated INR of 5.8.
Hematology/oncology was consulted and DIC panel was checked.
There were no signs of DIC and hematology felt that it was most
likely combination of poor nutrition, antibiotics (she was on
Unasyn for H.flu pneumonia) and vitamin K deficiency.  Her INR
improved drastically with 5mg of Vitamin K and she successfully
underwent [**3-23**] but she self-DC'd the PEG on the night of
placement despite restraining of her strong/non-paretic hand.
Prior to the PEG placement, she pulled out several NG tubes as
well.

Surgery and GI were also consulted given concern for leak and
perforation.  Patient had rectal tube placed and received
multiple enemas for decompression of cecal distention.  Although
aphasic, given patient's obvious refusal for nutrition
intervention, family meeting was held again to discuss patient's
wish for herself.  Family including HCP, [**Name (NI) 16883**] reports that the
patient always was clear about not wanting heroic measures hence
given poor prognosis and her previous stated wishes, plan of
care was cha
