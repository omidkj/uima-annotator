Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
revision of L3-L5 spinal fusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
laminectomy of L2 with L3-L5 fusion and hardware removal with
iliac crest autograft


History of Present Illness:
66 y/o man with history of HTN, prior history of alcohol abuse,
on chronic narcotics for back pain, CAD s/p MI and stenting,
admitted to the hospital for laminectomy of L2, fusion of L3-L5,
removal of previous instrumentation and iliac crest autograft.
His surgery was performed on [**2159-5-1**]. His postoperative course
has been complicated by the development of "twitching" overnight
as well as difficult to manage pain, fevers, tachycardia, and
low urine output. The twitching started around 2400 in his face
and limbs, and has progressively gotten worse. At first, there
was concern for alcohol withdrawl although the patient denies
drinking for over a year, and the patient was given valium on a
CIWA scale. the patient denies ever having had a seizure
although the interview is limited by his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status. Over the course of the last 24 hours, the patient
had an epidural placed (during surgery) for pain control, which
was removed this morning around 7am (it was capped at 10pm
yesterday). He was then on dilaudid PCA for pain control.
.
His surgeries have been complicated by altered mental status in
the past in '[**56**] which was attributed to infection of unknown
etiology, possibly meningitis, although no cultures were
positive. He was treated at that time with 14 days of ceftaz and
vancomycin. In '[**57**] he developed postoperative delerium which was
treated with Haldol and at that time was seen by psychiatry. His
low urine output responded well to fluid boluses overnight,
however, his postoperative creatinine was elevated. CXR showed
early right lower lobe infiltrate.
.
The morning of transfer to floor, received total 20mg valium,
2mg ativan IV, and 10 of haldol for agitation, as well as a
total of 7mg dilaudid in 1mg increments for pain.

Head CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is a focal
area of low attenuation within the periventricular white matter
in the anterior limb of the left internal capsule. This could be
due to a small lacunar infarct. There are periventricular white
matter hypodensities consistent with chronic microvascular
ischemic change. There is no midline shift, mass effect, or
hydrocephalus. There is atherosclerotic disease. There is mild
mucosal thickening within the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.

AP CXR [**5-2**]: Cardiac size is normal, costophrenic angles are
sharp. There is no re-distribution. There is a mild increase in
lung markings in the right lower lobe extending to the diaphragm
and an early infiltrate in this area is probably present. Some
chronic interstitial changes to the right upper lobe are again
seen. These have been present on prior chest x-rays dating back
to [**2156**].
IMPRESSION: Probable early right lower lobe infiltrates.

AP CXR [**5-3**]: Upright frontal AP radiograph, comparison [**2159-5-2**],
demonstrates unchanged interstitial opacities throughout the
right lung. The apparent airspace consolidation in the lower
lung is no longer present and may have represented confluence of
vascular shadows. Heart, mediastinum and pleural surfaces are
unremarkable. The right CP angle is not included on this study.
IMPRESSION: Interstitial opacity throughout right lung, chronic.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o man with HTN, prior history of alcohol abuse, on chronic
narcotics for back pain, CAD s/p MI and stenting, admitted to
the hospital for spinal surgery, course complicated by fever,
tachycardia, delirium, also hospital acquired pneumonia and
acute renal failure.
.
# delirium: disoriented after surgery and 48hrs after admission
accompanied by tachycardia in a formerly heavy drinker, high
suspicion for alcohol withdrawal, although family adamantly deny
recent alcohol use. Also considered infection (ie, pneumonia or
less likely meningitis) or metabolic derangement but
electrolytes wnl. EKG and enzymes x1 were negative to rule out
atypical presentation of ischemic disease. Received thiamine and
folate IV x3 days and CIWA scale ativan; awoke with clear
sensorium and oriented to person, place, and time four days post
op.
.
# pneumonia: RLL infiltrate seen on CXR [**5-2**], less obvious on
repeat CXR, along with fevers; treated initially with broad
spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired organisms. Culture
grew Proteus as well as two other morphologies of GNR; narrowed
coverage to levofloxacin and flagyl, will complete 10 day course
on [**5-15**]. Afebrile with O2 Sats 93-95% on room air at discharge.
.
# acute renal failure: unclear etiology; urine micro unrevealing
per nephrology consult and urine lytes suggested but were not
classic for pre-renal azotemia and Cr did not respond to 1L
fluid challenge. Avoid nephrotoxins, ie furosemide, lisinopril,
gabapentin for now and monitor. Creatinine was down to 1.8 from
peak of 2.2 on the day of discharge; will need outpatient
creatinine check and can likely restart ACE, diuretic if
Creatinine continued to return to baseline.
.
# s/p laminectomy of L2 with L3-L5 fusion and hardware removal
with iliac crest autograft on [**5-1**]: Per Dr[**Name (NI) 12040**] team, pt may
ambulate with brace; no brace required while in bed.
Breakthrough pain controlled with oxycodone once patient was
able to take po, continued home oxycontin; stopped gabapentin
because of renal failure.
.
# HTN: continued metoprolol, nitrates
.
# CAD: post-op cardiac enzymes were negative and patient had no
symptoms of CAD. patient had completed >1 year of plavix for
stents the week prior to surgery. Restarted ASA at discharge.
Continued beta blocker. ACE held due to renal failure.
.
# Iron deficiency anemia, compounded by perioperative blood loss
anemia: Iron studies showed iron 19, so started iron sulfate
325mg daily. Should have screening colonoscopy as outpatient.
.
# antibiotic associated diarrhea: C diff toxin negative x3.
Imodium prn for symptom control until completes course of
antibioics
