Brief Hospital Course:
Shortly after arrival, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed recurrent,
persistent chest pain despite intravenous therapy. For
refractory ischemia, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] placement of an
IABP. He was then urgently brought to the operating room for
coronary artery bypass grafting. The operation was uneventful.
Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. There he was extubated and weaned from inotropic
support. The IABP was removed on postoperative day one without
complication. He was transfused with PRBCs and platelet to
maintain normal levels. He did well and transferred to the SDU
on postoperative day two.

 Intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation were noted and
treated with Amiodarone. He maintained stable hemodynamics and
remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm/sinus bradycardia with
rates between 69 and 48 beats per minute.  The [**Last Name (un) **] center was
consulted to assist in the management of his newly diagnosed
diabetes mellitus. Insulin therapy was initiated. Over several
days, medical therapy was optimized and he continued to make
clinical improvements. Once his blood sugars were more well
controlled, he was cleared for discharge to rehab on POD #8. His
amiodarone is to be tapered down on [**2-13**], and [**Last Name (un) **] recommends
Humalog 75/25  22 units every AM, and 14 units with dinner.  T
