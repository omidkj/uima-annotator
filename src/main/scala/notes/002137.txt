History of Present Illness:
HPI: 53 year old male with severe COPD, remote L CVA (residual R
sided weakness), DM, hypercarbic respiratory failure,
chronically vented was sent to ED because of worsening hypoxia.
.
Pt usually gets his care at [**Hospital1 112**]/BU but since no beds were
available, he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He has been intubated at the
beginning of [**2140-10-10**], reportedly at [**Hospital3 **] for
hypercarbic respiratory failure in setting of severe COPD.
Before that he has been O2 dependent due to severe COPD, living
at a NH. At the OSH, he was found to have a RML and RLL collapse
and paratracaheal LAD as well as chronic right pleural
effusions. He also has questionable old granulomatous lung
disease with calcified hilar LAD. He eventually required
trach/PEG because of difficulties weaning from the vent. He
reportedly had twice a bronchoscopy done ruling out malignancy.
He was at rehab ([**Hospital 671**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital) since [**11-8**]. He has
been doing better until the middle of [**Month (only) **], when he was on
CPAP transiently.
.
However, since the end of [**Month (only) **], his respiratory status
worsened again and he remained on AC. He developed worsening O2
sats over the last 24h despite increasing FiO2 from 80% to 100%.
CXR from [**12-7**] showed R pleural effusion (old) and dense R lobe
opacity. He was also noted to have copious, greenish secretions
and low grade temps (99.9 on [**12-17**]). Has been on Vanc from [**12-1**]
to [**12-12**] and remained on flagyl since [**12-16**] (unclear reason for
abx per discussion with covering O/C physician at rehab). Per
rehab note, sputum from [**12-10**] with Pseudomonas sensitive only to
Gent, but felt to be colonizer. ABG in AM of [**12-18**] was 7.59/51/29
on AC with 90% FiO2, Tv 600, PEEP 10. Per handwritten note, also
CXR with increased interstitial markings in addition to chronic
effusions as above. Pt received 40mg Lasix IVx3 with good UOP
but without improvement in his respiratory status. Pt was
subsequently sent to [**Hospital1 18**].
.

In the ED, his VS were T96.9, HR 106, BP 90/49, RR14, O2 sats
86% on AC (satting initially in the 70s-80s on AC 100% FiO2,
500x14, PEEP of 5). An ABG was 7.41/86/48. HCO3 on chemistries
was 41. He improved rapidly with deep suctioning to sats in the
high 80s, then 90s. His CXR showed multilobar collapse of the
right lobe and near opacification of the left hemithorax. He was
positioned on the right with further improvement in his
respiratory status. Repeat ABG was 7.39/72/73.  He remained
afebrile. UA was negative. Lactate was 1.9. WBC 10.2 with 79.6%
neutrophils, no bands (last WBC at rehab on [**12-15**] was 7.9). He
received one dose of Vanc, Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed
pneumonia as well as 5L IVF for transient SBPs in the low 90s.
Trop was 0.02. EKG without any acute ST changes. He is now being
admitted to the ICU for further management of his hypoxia.
.
On arrival to the ICU, he was satting 87-98% on AC FiO2 100%,
500x14, PEEP of 5.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2140-12-18**] 8:56 PM

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT

Reason: eval line placement, r/o ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old man with sepsis, L consolidation and R lobar
collapse w/ new right subclavian.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval line placement, r/o ptx
AP CHEST 9:38 P.M. ON [**12-18**].

HISTORY: Sepsis, left lung consolidation and right lobar
collapse. Rule out pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:

Consolidation throughout the left lung is probably severe, and
exaggerated by a large posteriorly layering left pleural
effusion. Moderate right pleural effusion and mild edema in the
right lung are new. Lower lobe collapse is unchanged. CT
scanning would probably be helpful to better characterize the
thoracic abnormalities that are present, including possibility
of extensive mediastinal adenopathy, possible pericardial
effusion and size of the cardiac silhouette, which is largely
obscured by abnormality in the left hemithorax.

One right subclavian line ends in the upper SVC, and
tracheostomy tube tip is in standard placement in the mid
trachea. No nasogastric tube seen.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was paged to report these findings at the time of
dictation.
