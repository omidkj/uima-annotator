Chest pain

Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
79 y/o male with PMHx significant for CABG and porcine AVR in
[**2116**] who presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] with cough, fever, and
shortness of breath.  Patient states that shortness of breath
was the primary symptom where he could not even take a few steps
without getting short of breath.  At [**Hospital3 4107**] it was felt
that he had a RLL pneumonia and started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.  During his hospital stay he suddenly became
nauseous and had episodes of dry heaves x 5; denies any emesis.
After the episode of dry heaves patient developed chest
tightness which he states was relieved with aspirin.  His nausea
resolved after getting anti-emetics.  His cardiac enzymes became
positive and peaked with TropI of 1.48 and CK of 103.  He was
diagnosed with an NSTEMI and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
cath.
.
Upon arrival it was noted that patient INR was 2.2 and family
not aware patient transferred for cath.  It was decided to defer
cath until further workup.
.
On review of symptoms, patient states that he needs [**12-22**] pillows
at home. He denies any PND. Last time he had CP was months ago.
Also rather tightness than pain. Associated with anxiety/stress.
Never had CP during the time of his CABG (was just found to have
an old MI on stress test). He has a dry cough with occasional
sputum production (clear). Sick contacts significant for his
daughter who had similar symptoms two weeks ago and was treated
with abx. No urinary symptoms. No recent changes in his bowel
movements.

.
EKG at OSH demonstrated NSR, LBBB pattern with diffuse ST
changes but no change compared to an EKG from 3/13 per EKG
report at OSH.
.
EKG at [**Hospital1 18**] showed similar findings (LBBB).
.
Nuclear stress test at OSH on [**2124-3-3**] showed large, moderately
severe, fixed defect in lateral wall and large, severe, fixed
defect in inferior wall. Also severe hypokinesis with LVEF of
24%.
.
Cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 20% per report from echo in [**2120**].
.
CXR [**2124-6-8**]:
1.  Left-sided pleural thickening may represent malignant or
nonmalignant
(loculated effusion) pleural based disease and not fully
characterized.
2.  Ovoid opacity along the major fissure likely represents
fluid.  Right lung base opacities not fully characterized.
Comparison with prior studies (chest radiographs or CTs) is
recommended and/or a baseline CT scan with IV contrast for
further characterization.
3.  Status post CABG and aortic valve replacement.
.
Echo [**2124-6-9**]: Left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity
enlargement and extensive regional and global biventricular
systolic function c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Normal functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. At least mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation.
.
CT chest w/o contrast [**2124-6-9**]:
1.  No evidence of lobar pneumonia.
2.  Bilateral partially loculated pleural effusions in the upper
portion of the chest and bilateral areas of smoothly marginated
pleural thickening in the lower portions of the chest.
Evaluation of pleural disease is limited in the absence of
intravenous contrast.  Diffuse pleural thickening can be seen as
a sequela of prior asbestos exposure, and at least one calcified
pleural plaque is identified.  Malignant pleural disease is more
typically unilateral than bilateral but a malignant etiology
cannot be excluded.
3.  Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy with additional nodes
in the supraclavicular and retrocrural region.  Etiology is
uncertain.  If the patient has experienced recent CHF in a
setting of the history of myocardial infarction, the nodes could
potentially be related to this condition. However, short-term
followup CT in [**3-24**] weeks may be helpful to ensure resolution and
to exclude a neoplastic cause such as lymphoma or metastatic
disease.
4.  Diffuse ground-glass opacities with mild septal thickening.
Although non-specific, this is very likely due to hydrostatic
edema.
5.  Incompletely imaged 8.5 cm left renal cystic lesion.
Dedicated renal ultrasound could be performed for complete
characterization if warranted clinically.

CXR ([**2124-7-11**])
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-29**] through 16.
Moderate right pleural effusion has changed in distribution,
still substantially fissural, but not in overall volume. The
smaller left pleural effusion is stable. The portions of the
lungs not obscured by pleural abnormality are grossly clear. ET
tube, nasogastric tube, and left subclavian line are in standard
placement. Right PIC line ends in the lower SVC. No
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, ischemic
cardiomyopathy, diabetes originally admitted to OSH with severe
dyspnea where he was treated for presumed pneumonia, transferred
for cardiac catheterization which was deferred secondary to
ongoing pneumonia and decompensated CHF.Pt was intubated on the
floor for hypoxic respiratory [**Hospital 73895**] transferred to the
MICU. Pt had a long MICU course complicated by FUO along with
rash which resolved secondary to discontinuation of zosyn which
was being given empirically for presumed pna. Pt. failed
extubation secondary to pulmonary edema in the context of pt's
extremely low EF. Pt's HD status remained tenous throughout with
daily episodes of transient hypotension mostly responsive to
fluid boluses and later responsive to transient pressors as
attempts were being made to diurese patient for immienent
hypotension. Pt. also treated for psuedomonas VAP with
tobramycin and ceftazadime.
After agressive treatment, patient continued to deteriorate in
clinical condition, requiring continuous mechanical ventilation
and pressors. Renal function worsened and multi-system failure
ensued. After many family discussions regarding prognosis, we
were asked to not attempt resusitation in the event of cardiac
arrest. With further worsening, family requested pressors to be
stopped and to begin comfort measures. Patient expired on
[**2124-7-12**] shortly after stopping pressors. Family member was at
the bedside.
