NS. Got CTA of abd and LE to r/o RP , saw large hematoma of
gluteus and vastus lateralis no active extravasation. Had
negative LLE US for DVT. IV vitK and 2 U FFP, 2U were ordered
and being given on transport. Surgery consulted preemptively in
the ED in case patient develops compartment syndrome,
compartments noted to be soft.

.
Left Lower Extremity US ([**2143-2-28**]):
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of the left common femoral,
superficial femoral, deep femoral and popliteal veins were
performed. There is normal compressibility, flow and
augmentation throughout. The calf veins were not visualized due
to extensive soft tissue edema. In the region of the
bruise along the medial aspect of the left thigh, there is
diffuse
subcutaneous soft tissue swelling, without a focal hematoma.
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left lower extremity. The calf veins
were not visualized. Subcutaneous edema.
.
CXR ([**2143-2-28**]):
Small bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar opacities may
represent combination of effusion and atelectasis, although
underlying early
consolidation cannot be excluded. 1.3-cm nodular opacity
projecting over the right lung may represent nipple shadow, this
can be confirmed with repeat with nipple markers. Stable
cardiomediastinal silhouette. Calcified left hilar node again
seen.
.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis With and Without Contrast ([**2143-2-28**]):
1. Moderate to large hematoma involving the left gluteus medius
and vastus lateralis and the subcutaneous soft tissues of the
left proximal and mid-thigh without evidence of active
extravasation.
3. 2.9 x 2.6 cm partially visualized right popliteal artery
aneurysm.
4. Right retrocrural and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy of
unclear clinical significance. Correlate with history of
malignancy/clinical history and follow-up.
