NOTE:  Discharge date is pending.  A Discharge Summary
Addendum will be upon discharge.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post motor vehicle accident.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old
gentleman status post motor vehicle crash, unrestrained
driver ejected partially.  The patient complaining of severe
back pain and inability to move bilateral lower extremities
on presentation.  The patient was hemodynamically stable with
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale of 15 on transfer by medical flight.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left lower extremity fracture.
2.  Significant tobacco history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  No medications at home.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On presentation, the
patient's temperature was 98 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart
rate was 120, his blood pressure was 110/60, his respiratory
rate was 24, and his oxygen saturation was 92% on face mask.
On examination, the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.  The extraocular movements were intact.  There was
ecchymosis inferior to the left eye.  The trachea was
midline.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate
and rhythm.  There were bilateral coarse breath sounds.
Tenderness to the thoracolumbosacral.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  The pelvis was stable.  There
were no deformities or costovertebral angle tenderness to the
bilateral flanks.  The back and neck examination was positive
for a gross deformity at T12-L1.  The cervical spine had no
deformities or stepoff tenderness.  Rectal examination
revealed a decreased tone and was guaiac-negative.  Extremity
examination was within normal limits with palpable pulses
throughout, but inability to move bilateral lower
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Complete blood
count was within normal limits.  Chemistries and coagulations
were within normal limits.  His lactate was 1.6.  Urine was
negative.  Toxicology screen was negative.  Urine toxicology
screen was positive for cocaine.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Radiologic films with a chest
x-ray which showed bilateral pulmonary contusions and rib
fractures of six, seven, and nine on the right and nine on
the left.  This also revealed a left pneumothorax for which a
chest tube was placed.

A computed tomography of the abdomen also showed a large
retroperitoneal hematoma and a L1 burst fracture with bone in
the spinal canal.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was intubated
with a orogastric tube inserted.  A Foley catheter was
placed.  The patient was put on a Solu-Medrol drip and was
kept sedated while intubated in the Intensive Care Unit.

Neurosurgery was consulted.  Lower extremity examination
showed bilateral lower extremity placidity.  No reflexes.  No
withdrawal to painful stimulation, and no clonus.

Also on admission to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had
a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed depressed cardiac
output and index.  Cardiology was consulted, and an
echocardiogram was performed.  This echocardiogram showed no
effusion or evidence of tamponade with normal-appearing right
ventricular function and possibly somewhat depressed left
ventricular function.

In addition, and Ophthalmology consultation was called
regarding fractures of the zygomatic arch and macular sinus.
Their conclusion was that the bilateral globes were intact,
and subconjunctival hemorrhage of the left eye required no
treatment and recommended conservative treatment.

A magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was obtained
on [**3-28**], when the patient was hemodynamically stable
enough to have this study.   The findings were abnormal
signals in L1 anteriorly and posteriorly; consistent with
fractures.  It also showed abnormal cord signal with
high-grade cord compression in T10, T11, L1, and L2.
Neurosurgery reviewed these films and decided to take the
patient to the operating room.  The patient is status post L1
laminectomy and T7 through L3 posterior fixation on [**2135-4-1**].

At this time, the patient had spiking temperatures with
possible leukocytosis.  Cultures were obtained, and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from the sputum
culture from [**4-1**], and Escherichia coli from his sputum
culture from [**3-30**], and Klebsiella from a blood culture
from [**3-30**].  Levaquin and vancomycin were started on [**4-1**] and [**4-2**]; respectively.

On [**4-3**], the patient was extubated and the chest tube was
discontinued.  The patient tolerated these events well.
The rest of the patient's course was unremarkable.  The
patient was transfused packed red blood cells on an as needed
basis.  Psychiatry was consulted for supportive care and two
events of hallucinations at night.  The Speech and Swallow
Service was also consulted.  The patient passed the swallow
study and was able to tolerate a regular diet upon discharge
without problems.

The patient had a persistent leukocytosis but remained
afebrile with negative cultures throughout the hospital
course.  This was thought to be a leukemoid reaction
secondary to the neurosurgical operation.  The patient had no
signs of infection.

The patient was aggressively with Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy and had a TLSO brace in place throughout
his hospital stay.

Upon discharge, the patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular diet.  The chest
tube site was clean, dry, and intact.  The patient had a
regular rate and rhythm, and the lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The patient's abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  The patient was educated on
self catheterization.  The patient was on an aggressive bowel
regimen and was having regular bowel movements upon
discharge.  The patient completed a course of vancomycin and
was switched to by mouth levofloxacin for a 14-day course
upon discharge.
