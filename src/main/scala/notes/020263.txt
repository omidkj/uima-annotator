Pertinent Results:
[**2197-5-9**] Echo: PRE BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. A large (2 cm) secundum atrial septal defect is present.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior akinesis, severe septal and anterolateral hypokinesis
in the backdrop of moderate global hypokinesis. The base of the
lateral wall functions best. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS: The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion
and is atrially paced. There is normal right ventricular
systolic function. The left ventricle displays both improved
global function as well as improved function of the septum and
anterior walls. The left ventricular ejection fraction is now
40-45%. The interatrial septum is status post placement of a
patch. A very small residual left to right shunt across the
septum remains. The thoracic aorta is intact after
decannulation. No other significant changes from the pre-bypass
findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for pre-op workup and Plavix washout. He
remained stable, receiving medical management while awaiting
Plavix washout prior to surgery. On [**5-9**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass x 4
and atrial septal defect closure. Please see operative note for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later that
day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. On post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers
and diuretics and gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight.
Later this day he was transferred to the step-down floor for
further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol.  On the evening of post-operative day
three he developed flash pulmonary edema and was transferred to
the surgical intensive care unit.  By the morning he had mental
status changes and his PO2 began to decrease.  By late morning
he required intubation with bilateral white-out on his chest
radiograph.  He began to spike fevers and was pan cultured.  A
chest/abdomen/pelvis CT which revealed lungs with fluid
overload/possible pneumonia.  Antibiotics were begun and an
infectious disease consult was requested.  After several days of
diuresis and antibiotics his lungs improved and he was
extubated.  His mental status changes had resolved.  He was
transferred to the step down floor to complete his antibiotics
course.   By post-operative day 13 he was ready for discharge to
home.  All follow-up appointments were advised.
