Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8810**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC Line placed [**8-18**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41105**] is a 73-year-old retired [**State 350**] superior
court judge who was in his usual state of health until
approximately one month ago when he noticed progressive
weakness, nausea, and constipation following inguinal hernia
repair in early 07/[**2133**].  Initially, his symptoms were
attributed to parkinsonism and medication adjustments were made.
 However, on [**2134-8-11**], he became progressively weak and was
brought to the [**Hospital1 69**] emergency
room with chief complaint of syncope x 2 at home, where he was
found to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.6 and
hypercalcemia with a calcium of 13.  He was treated with
aggressive hydration and was noted to have peripheral
lymphadenopathy. CT of the torso on [**2134-8-13**] demonstrated two
enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla.  The largest measuring
3.2 x 1.8 cm.  The 1.5 cm in the right axilla
pretracheal and prevascular lymph nodes as well as precarinal
and subcarinal lymph nodes.  There is also bilateral hilar
lymphadenopathy and a markedly enlarged spleen with multiple
lymph nodes in the splenic hilum.  Bone windows demonstrated a
3.5 x 3.3 cm lytic lesion in the right ileum extending to the
sacroiliac joint and 3.0 x 2.2 cm lytic lesion in the left
superior posterior acetabulum.  There are additional smaller
lytic lesions present in both iliac bones and there is a right
hip prosthesis.  Lymph node biopsy was performed [**8-16**] with
excision of the right axillary lymph node.  This biopsy
demonstrated a CD10 positive kappa restricted B-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD s/p CABG in 82, stent - lmca-prox lcx (patent [**8-27**]), last
streess [**2130**] nl w/o perfusion defects
2. CHF - 67% EF, mild-mod MR, thickened aortic, but no stenosis
or insufficiency on echo in [**2130**]
3. S/P R MCA CVA [**12-27**]-- on coumadin for 6mos
4. Parkinson's Disease
5. Spinal Stenosis
6. S/P L hernia repair [**2134-7-14**]
7. BPH, with known elevated PSA but nl biopsies, followed by
urology
8. Hypercholesterolemia
9. GIbleed- [**8-/2131**], presumed small bowel source in setting of
coumadin
10. Diverticuli
11. s/p cholecystectomy in 80's

Social History:
He is a retired judge.  He continues to work as
a mediator.  He has a 40-pack-year smoking history.  He quit in
[**2098**] but has smoked a periodic cigar or pipe.  He drinks wine
or
beer occasionally.  He lives with his wife.

Family History:
His mother had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer in early 40s.  His
brother has prostate cancer.  His routine healthcare maintenance
is significant for colonoscopies and endoscopy without findings
of malignancy.

Physical Exam:
ROS: (+) weight loss 40 lbs in 2 years, 8 lbs in 2 weeks. No
chest pain, shortness of breath, cough. No PND, orthopnea. No
abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia. He does report
intermittent constipation since his surgery, then diarrhea and
now with nl BMs. He also reports back pain at the area of his
known spinal stenosis which is worse, but is planning on seeing
his neurosurgeon for possible surgery. No other
f/c/cough/SOB/dysuria or other changes.
.
GENERAL:  He appears well.
HEENT:  Sclerae are anicteric.  Oropharynx with moist mucous
membranes without lesions.
NECK:  Supple.  There is no spinal or paraspinal tenderness in

LYMPHATICS:  There are 0.5 cm submandibular and cervical lymph
nodes.  There is a two to three centimeter left axillary lymph
node.  The right axillary region has a dressing.  It is clean,
dry, and intact.

Pertinent Results:
LABORATORY DATA:  Today are significant for white blood cell
count of 9.1 with a differential of 72% neutrophils, 20% lymphs,
5.5% monocytes, 1.6% eos, 0.3% basophils.  His hematocrit is
34.3
with an MCV of 85.  Platelets are 163,000.  Glucose of 77, BUN
is
12, creatinine is 0.8, sodium 135, potassium 4, chloride 105.
Bicarbonate is 20, LDH is 297.  Calcium is 9.1 down from 13,
phos
is low at 1.0, magnesium is 1.6.  Ferritin is 238.  TSH is 0.85.

PTH is low at 10.  PSA is elevated at 6.9.  SPEP shows no
specific abnormalities.  UPEP shows no specific abnormalities.
PTHRP is pending, vitamin D 125 is pending.  Uric acid has not
been measured.  His iron is low at 41.

EKG: NSR at 67bpm, nl axis and intervals, small q's inferiorly
with TWI in III

MRI of the brain shows no evidence of malignancy.

Ultrasound confirms bilateral renal cysts and infiltrating
lesions of the
spleen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hypotension causes thought to be either iatrogrenic(BP meds), or
hypovolemia/dehydration.  Patient was rehydrated with IVF and
blood pressure meds were initially held.  Blood pressure
improved and remained hemodynamically stable.
.
Lymphoma:  As mentioned, axillary LN biopsy results were c/w
Burkitt's Lymphoma which correlates with the constellation of
symptoms that the pt presented with.  Hypercalcemia resolved
with adequate hydration.  PICC Line placed [**8-18**] for initiation
of chemo.  The patient was continued on IVFs and tumor lysis
labs were monitored initially q 6 hours, then [**Hospital1 **].  Given
elevated uric acid, allopurinol 300mg qd was continued, and
patient was administered chemotherapy per protocol.  Patient
tolerated the chemotherapy well, with no nausea/vomiting while
tolerating a cardiac diet, and remained afebrile.  However, he
did develop some loose stools prior to discharge, which
postponed his discharge as there was concern for patient having
to rush to bathroom, resulting in a fall which would be
extremely traumatic given his lytic bone lesions.  This diarrhea
was thought to be secondary to an aggressive bowel regimen as
patient had been previously constipated, and patient was given
some loperamide.  C-diff toxins were sent, which were negative.
On day of discharge, the diarrhea had resolved.  Twenty-four
hour
