Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mitral valve repair (28mm CG Future Annuloplasty Ring),
Tricuspid valve repair (28mm Contour 3D) [**9-27**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18329**] is a 77 year old female with history of valvular
disease, now admitted for atrial fibrillation and heart failure.
 She has been having increasing dyspnea with activity and has
been followed with serial echocardiograms. The most recent study
showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. A cardiac
catheterization on [**7-20**] revealed no significant coronary artery
disease but aortic and mitral regurgitation.  She now presents
for a heparin bridge from coumadin for surgery.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the
LA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. Depressed LAA
emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. No ASD by 2D
or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**12-26**]+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. See Conclusions for post-bypass data

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. A central jet of moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced, on no inotropes.
Biventricular function is unchanged. There is a mitral
annuloplasty ring in good position. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. No paravalvular leak is seen. There is no mitral stenosis
with a mean gradient of 2mmHg at a cardiac output of 3.7 L/min.
There is a tricuspid annuloplasty ring in good position. There
is no tricuspid regurgitation. No paravalvular leak is seen.
There is a mean gradient of 1 mmHg across the tricuspid valve
with cardiac output at 3.7 L/min.. Aortic regurgitation is mild
to moderate ([**12-26**]+). The aorta is intact post-decannulation.

HISTORY: 77-year-old woman following mitral valve and tricuspid
valve repair.
