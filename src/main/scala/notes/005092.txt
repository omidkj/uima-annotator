History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old female who underwent prior coronary
artery bypass grafting in [**2118**] for left main disease. Surgery
was done at [**Hospital3 28188**] center in [**Hospital1 1559**]. Her
postoperative course was complicated by hepatic failure with
coma x 5 weeks. The patient has since that time been
experiencing increasing shortness of breath and chest pressure
associated with dizziness and mild orthopnea. A transesophageal
echocardiogram done in [**2120-12-28**] showed an ejection fraction
of 60 percent, 3+ aortic insufficiency, [**1-30**]+ mitral
regurgitation and a normal aorta. She on a subsequent
catheterization in [**2121-3-28**] was found to have a patent
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending as well as
the OM, with moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and
moderate mitral regurgitation. Additionally, the patient had
carotid studies that showed no significant stenosis. She was
admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for anticipated
aortic valve replacement with +/- mitral valve repair or
replacement and a re-do sternotomy.

Of note, patient was originally admitted in [**2121-5-28**]. The
operation however was postponed secondary to hyponatremia and
mental status changes. Since that time, outpatient evaluation
was performed. A liver ultrasound was normal and biopsy in
[**2121-7-28**] found no evidence of cirrhosis.

years. She stopped drinking about 5 years ago. She admitted to
drinking one pint of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) 28189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. She used cocaine as a
teenager but denied IV drug use.


Family History:
Both grandparents had coronary artery disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Outside evaluation for her hyponatremia was unrevealing. Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] was therefore admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation. Sodium at time of admission was 125. Workup was
otherwise unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery. On
[**10-15**], she was taken to the operating room. An
intraoperative TEE revealed moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation in addition to her known aortic and mitral valve
insufficiency. As a result, she required an aortic valve
replacement, along with mitral and tricuspid valve repairs - see
operative note for details. Following the operation, she was
brought to the CSRU in stable condition. Her discharge summary
will now be broken down by systems:

CARDIAC: Early postop, she initially required multiple inotropes
to maintain adequate hemodynamics. Concomitantly noted to have
paroxsymal atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone
and low dose beta blockade. She also experienced periods of
junctional tachycardia. Over her hospital stay, beta blockade
was slowly advanced as tolerated. She remained mostly in a
normal sinus rhythm. Given her mechanical aortic valve, she was
maintained on Heparin with transition to Warfarin. Goal INR is
between 3-3.5

PULMONARY: She had a prolonged intubation secondary to labile
hemodynamics. First extubation trial on [**10-22**] failed,
requiring reintubation. Gradually tolerated pressure support
ventilation and was successfully extubated on [**10-25**]. Due
to a persistent right pleural effusion, a chest tube was placed
on [**10-27**]. There was minimal drainage which consistented
mostly of old blood. Given concern for loculation, the thoracic
service was consulted for VATS procedure. A chest CT was
obtained and significant for large partially loculated right
hemothorax. On [**10-30**], a right sided VATS was performed
along with bronchoscopy. There were no signs of active bleeding,
the hemothorax was drained without complication and the lung
expanded well at end of the operation. Additional chest tubes
were placed. She was followed by serial chest x-rays and the
chest tubes were eventually removed without complication.

VASCULAR: On [**11-4**], she experienced acute abdominal pain
and near syncopal episode while attempting a bowel movement. She
developed acute respiratory distress and required reintubation.
She concomitantly became hypotensive and was noted to have an
extreme drop in hematocrit, as low as 15%. Multiple blood
products were given. Inotropic support was required and she was
brought emergently to the operating room where she was noted to
have a retroperitoneal bleed secondary to a bleeding branch of
the external iliac artery. Once this artery was identified, it
was ligated with surgical clips. The remainder of the
retroperitoneum was examined and found to be free of areas of
bleeding. There was no active abdominal pathology.

GASTROINTESTINAL: LFTs remained essentially normal throughout
her hospital stay. Underwent exploratory laparotomy for an acute
abdomen - see above. A JP drain was placed at the time of
surgery and eventually removed without complication.

RENAL: Initially very fluid overloaded and placed on Lasix drip.
She was gradually transitioned to PO Lasix. Throughout her
hospital stay, her renal function remained stable and she
maintained adequate urine output.

NEUROLOGY: Initially had a prolonged sedation secondary to
cardiac and pulmonary issues. Once awake, she remained
neurologically intact. She suffers from chronic pain. A Fentanyl
patch was utilized with supplemental pain medications prn.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Initially febrile without signs of
infection. Fevers gradually resolved. She went on to experience
an acute leukocytosis during acute abdomen/retroperitoneal bleed
episode. White count peaked to 27K at that time. She was
temporarily put on broad spectrum antibiotics for concern for
hollow organ rupture. Antibiotics were eventually discontinued.

NUTRITION: Intermittently required tube feedings. Once clinical
stablized, her diet was advanced and she tolerated PO's without
difficulty.

OTHER: Once clinically stable, she worke
