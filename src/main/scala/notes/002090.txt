Service: NSURG


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old, right-
handed woman, with a history of left frontal vascular
malformation and right hand and arm focal motor seizures, who
presented with seizure lasting 45 minutes.  The patient was
in church the evening of admission singing choir when she had
a typical onset of right arm seizure.  Typically seizures
start in hand and move up the arm, and as a wave of shaking
lasting 1-2 minutes.

This one, on the evening of admission, was unusual in that it
extended to including twitching of her face, which did not
resolve on its own.  The patient reported she took her
medication regularly and has not missed any doses.  She
denied any recent illnesses and fevers.  She did not report
any bifrontal headache for the last few days.  No other
complaints.

On arrival to the Emergency Room, her blood pressure
initially was in the 160s and 170s.  She was having a
rhythmic right fist clenching and right arm rotation, as well
as right facial twitching.  She was 2 mg of Ativan times two
with good effect.

She returned from CAT scan, and neurologic exam was with
right arm, no anti-gravity.  She was also given 1 g of
Dilantin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Seizures.  First seizure was in [**2113**],
described as a grand mal.  Cerebral angiogram revealed an
inoperable AVM in the left brain.  She had  second grand mal
seizure and was started on Dilantin and Phenobarbital.  Since
that time, she has had right arm focal motor seizures but no
further generalized events.  These typically occur once a
month and recently declined changes in medications or doses
to try to decrease frequency.

Other medical history includes left frontal vascular anomaly,
arthritis, asthma, status post a right knee replacement in
[**2131**], a left hip replacement in [**2142**], left arm fracture in
[**2148**], and a torn right rotator cuff in [**2135**].

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Dilantin 400 mg q.o.d., Dilantin
500 mg every other day, Phenobarbital 30 mg at h.s., Purinol,
Celebrex, Asthmacort p.r.n.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a retired nurse practitioner.  She
lives alone.  She quit tobacco in [**2114**].  She smoked ten years
before that.  No ETOH or drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.8, blood
pressure 111/53, heart rate 77, respirations 16, oxygen
saturation 98 percent 3 L nasal cannula.  HEENT:  Sclera
anicteric.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2.  No murmur.  Two plus carotids without
bruit.  Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.  Extremities:  No
edema.  Warm and well perfused.  Neurologic:  After 4 mg of
Ativan, mental status was lethargic but arousable roughly;
she falls back to sleep when not stimulated.  Oriented to
person and place.  Attention:  Inattentive and lethargic.
Language fluent, mild to moderate dysrhythmia.  Improves with
better effort. No paraphasic errors.  She follows commands.
Memory not tested.  No obvious cranial neglect.  Cranial
nerves:  No obvious visual field defects, but difficult to
assess due to mental status.  Tongue midline.  Motor:  Normal
bulk and tone bilaterally.  Fasciculations absence in upper
and lower extremities.  No tremor.  Right arm at least 4,
deltoid, biceps, and triceps.  Right hand with 1-2 finger
extensors.  Sensation was grossly intact to light touch.
Unable to reliably assess double-simultaneous stimulation due
to mental status.  Reflexes:  Deep tendon reflexes 2 and
asymmetric in arms, absent at patellar and ankle.  Toes were
downgoing bilaterally.  Unable to assess coordination and
gait due to mental status.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and CHEM7 was normal; coags are
pending; Dilantin 3.7 on admission; Phenobarbital 10.5.

Head CT showed old left posterior frontal calcified lesion,
likely cavernous and angioma.  Per MRI in [**2148-10-11**] with
new small amount of subarachnoid blood and surrounding sulci.
No loss of grey-white matter differentiation.  No new
hypodensity in area.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Neurosurgery Service to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for
q.1 hour neurochecks given her new subarachnoid blood.  She
was loaded with Dilantin and continued with Phenobarbital
also.  MRI/MRA per protocol was recommended per Neurology,
and Neurology did see the patient.  Her chest pain was kept
less than 130 in the Intensive Care Unit, and the head of her
bed was kept greater than 30 degrees to decrease aspiration
risk.

On her first admission day, her Dilantin level was at 14.7.
Her blood pressure was 130/62, heart rate 54.  She was awake,
alert, and oriented.  IPs were antigravity.  She had a right
pronator drift.  She was prepared preoperatively to have an
angiogram done.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] reviewed her head CT which he felt showed a small
amount of subarachnoid blood, unrelated to her AVM, which
appeared unchanged from prior studies.

Her MRI and MRA revealed a left frontal AVM with venous
anomaly in the left frontal sulci.  I did not appear to be
changed from previous studies.  It appeared that the patient
had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**] paralysis improving.  She continued on Dilantin
500 mg daily and Phenobarbital 30 mg daily.

A diagnostic cerebral angiogram was performed on [**3-28**] by
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  It showed a nonspecific irregular area of
focal stricturing and dilation within the left A2 anterior
cerebral artery branches, as well as the left M2 middle
cerebral artery branches.  Similar areas of stricturing were
seen within the branches of the left superficial temporal
arteries originating from the left external carotid artery.
This finding was nonspecific in origin but could represent a
vasculitis.  There was focal stenosis of the origin of the
right vertebral artery.  There were no angiographic findings
that correlated with the patient's known left frontal
vascular malformation.  The right common carotid artery could
not be cannulated due to the tortuosity of the patient's
vasculature.

On [**3-29**], the patient was transferred from the Intensive
Care Unit to the regular surgical floor.  She remained
neurologically intact with her motor strength at 5 out of 5.
Physical Therapy saw the patient and felt that she ambulated
with support, although she had decreased functional mobility
and had problems with her balance and endurance and that she
could benefit from a short stay at a rehabilitation facility.

Her Dilantin level on [**3-30**] was 16.5.  She had three right-
hand shaking episodes.  The patient informed us that she had
been on Phenobarbital 90 mg a day, not 30 mg a day, and so
her Phenobarbital doses were increased to 90 mg daily.

On the day of discharge, [**3-31**], she was awake, alert,
oriented, and had four right-arm shaking episodes in the last
24 hours.  Her Phenobarbital dose then had been increased to
90.  Her vital signs were within normal limits.  Her pupils
were [**3-12**] bilaterally.  Extraocular movements were full.  No
facial asymmetry.  She is to be discharged to rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Acute physical therapy as needed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 500 mg per day,
Phenobarbital 90 mg q.h.s.

FOLLOW UP:  She should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in two weeks
and also follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2442**]; the
appointment is to be scheduled; not available at this time.
She should return back to the Emergency Room for any
neurologic changes or for seizure activity that is increased
or unusual compared to her baseline seizure activity.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Seizure disorder.  No angiographic findings that correlate
   with the patient's known left frontal vascular
   malformation.
2. Asthma.
3. Arthritis.
