History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 y.o. female with a history of type II DM,
hypertension, and schizophrenia who presented to [**Hospital3 **]
on [**11-8**] with chest pain. She reports that on the day of
admission, while babys[**Name (NI) 12854**] her grandchildren, she began to
have sudden onset of substernal chest pain radiating to the neck
and to the left arm. She reports that this pain was [**11-7**] in
severity and she describes it as a "squeezing" pain. She also
reports that her pain was accompanied by left arm numbness. She
also notes lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and nausea. She also
became acutely short of breath and called EMS. She was brought
to the ED where she had VS as follows: BP 123/70, HR 90, T 98.4,
O2 Sat 99% RA. She continued to have pain despite sl NTG x 3
with only mild improvement. Her pain improved from [**11-7**] to [**7-8**]
in severity after NTG x 3 and she was started on nitro gtt and
her pain resolved approximately 4 hours following its onset.
.
Her cardiac markers were negative x 3 and she had no EKG
changes. She had 3 more transient episodes of chest pain during
her hospitalization at the OSH. These episodes lasted for
approximately 5 minutes each and resolved with SL NTG. Her last
episode was on the evening of [**11-10**]. Of note, she had a positive
stress test with a reversible anterior apical defect on [**11-9**].
She was transferred here for aspirin desensitization follwed by
cardiac cath.
.
She reports that she has been having similar chest pain on
exertion for approximately 3 weeks. She reports that she has had
chest pain on climbing approximately 2 flights of stairs. She
has complete resolution of pain with rest. Her chest pain has
been progressively more severe in intensity and more frequent
leading up to her chest pain that brought her to the ED. She
also reports that approximately 10 years ago, she had chest pain
on exertion which self-resolved without intervention. She was
told that these episodes were episodes of "angina." She
reportedly had a negative stress test at that time.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain. No history
of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

          4. Inferior -        normal
          5. Postero basal -   normal
Other findings:
Mitral valve was normal.
.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated an LMCA, LAD, LCX and RCA all free of
angiographically-apparent CAD.
2. Left ventriculography showed normal LV EF of 60%; there were
no focal
wall motion abnormalities noted. No mitral regurgitation.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics showed elevated LV filling
pressure of
25 mmHg. There was no gradient across the aortic valve.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old female with HTN, DM who presents with exertional
chest pain, found to have abnormal stress test and transferred
for ASA desensitization prior to cardiac catheterization.
Hospital course by problem:
.
1. ASA desensitization: She meets criteria for ASA-exacerbated
respiratory disease (AERD) which includes asthma, ASA
sensitivity, and rhinitis/nasal polyps. She underwent ASA
desensitization per protocol with Benadryl prior to
desensitization and epinephrine by bedside. There were no
reactions and she tolerated the desensitization without problem.

.
2. Chest pain: Her history was suggestive of unstable angina.
Per OSH records she had a positive stress-MIBI with a reversible
anterior apical defect. Her TIMI score of 2 on admission at OSH
prompted conservative management at OSH with plavix, BB, and
statin. She was transferred for ASA desensitization, after which
cardiac cath was performed. She was premedicated appropriately
for her contast allergy. The catheterization was entirely
normal, with clean coronary arteries and a preserved ejection
fraction of 60%. For primary coronary artery disease prevention,
she was discharged on a statin, BB, and [**Last Name (un) **], with the addition
of a daily plavix instead of Aspirin, as this has been shown to
have therapeutic equivalence in MI prophylaxis.
.
3. DM: Held glucophage in setting of cardiac cath. Her
Hemoglobin A1c was 6.4%, reflecting good glycemic control. She
was covered with an insulin sliding scale while hospitalized,
with FSG QID. Instructed to resume taking metformin on [**2198-11-16**].
.
4. Schizophrenia: Stable, continued home regimen of abilify and
sertraline
.
5. HTN: Well controlled here. Continued [**Last Name (un) **] and BB.
.
6. Anemia: Hct 31.6 (34.8 at OSH). Iron studies revealed a
low-normal iron level
- Guaiac stool
.
7. Leukocytosis: No evidence of acute infection with no
localizing symptoms, and resolved on hospital day #1. Likely
stress response, as she was afebrile throughout.
.
8. F/E/N: Ate a diabetic, cardiac diet.
.
