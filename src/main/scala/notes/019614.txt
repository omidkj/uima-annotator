Pertinent Results:
[**2188-9-26**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
without
stenoses.  The LAD had a 90% stenosis at D1.  The LCX had a
proximal 50%
stenosis and was totally occluded after OM1 with left-to-left
collaterals filling the distal vessel.  The RCA was occluded
proximally
with left-to-right collaterals filling the distal vessel.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated
left
ventricular end-diastolic pressures (28 mmHg) but normal early
diastolic
pressures (8 mmHg) consistent with diastolic dysfunction.  There
was no
aortic stenosis.
3.  Left ventriculography demonstrated a preserved ejection
fraction of
60%, with mild inferior hypokinesis.  No mitral regurgitation
was seen.

[**2188-9-29**] ECHO
Prebypass:
1.The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
4.There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
7.Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2188-9-29**] at 345pm.

Post Bypass:
1. Patient is being AV paced and receivig an infusion of
phenylephrine.
2. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
3. Aorta intact post decannulation.
4. Mild mitral regurgitation persists.

Final Report
PORTABLE CHEST, [**2188-10-1**]

COMPARISON: [**2188-9-29**].

INDICATION: Chest tube removal.

Numerous indwelling devices have been removed, with no evidence
of
pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
appearance. Worsening
atelectasis at left lung base with elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm and
probable small right effusion. Minor areas of patchy and linear
atelectasis
in the right mid and lower lung are also demonstrated.
