Chief Complaint:
diarrhea, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE, external pacemaker implantation.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is s 31 yo M with PMH of HIV/AIDS (CD4= 34, not on
HAART), Hep B + C, and ESRD on HD who presents from dialysis
with fever and abdominal pain x 3 days.

He reports 2-3 days of watery, non-bloody diarrhea up to five
times a day. He has had some abdominal pain and nausea, but no
vomiting. He c/o some stomach cramps such that he stopped eating
food but he did keep drinking fluids. +thirsty. He does not make
any urine at baseline. He has had a dry throat but no cough. He
describes headaches that come and go as well as some mild
photophobia, which is baseline for him.

He went to HD today, and was noted to be hypotensive to 80/50
and febrile 101.3. He was then referred to the ED; no dialysis
was done.

In the ED, VS: 100.5 90 90/49 16 100%RA. Tmax in ED was 101.3
and lowest SBP (by report, not recorded), was 63. Abdomen was
tender in LUQ. Guaiac negative. Labs were notable for lactate of
0.6, no leukocytosis. EKG with TWI in V2-V3, but no ischemic
changes. CXR revealed no acute process. Given hypotension, a
quick bedside US of chest was performed, which showed no
pericardial effusion. 3L NS administered, and BP improved to
100s. A CT abdomen was obtained which showed thickening of
descending colon. Blood cultures were drawn, and he received
levo and flagyl, as well as tylenol and ASA. He was then
admitted to the ICU. Renal evaluated the patient and did not
think there was an indication for urgent dialysis. Most recent
vitals 95.1 57 100/56 17 100%RA.

Studies:
[**2188-9-11**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Prolonged P-R interval. Compared to
the previous tracing no change.

[**2188-9-11**] CXR - The patient is status post median sternotomy. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There are no areas of
consolidation. The visualized bones appear unremarkable. The
previously seen ground glass opacities have resolved.
CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2188-9-11**] CT abd and pelvis with contrast - CONCLUSION:
1. Stable hepatosplenomegaly without any focal lesions.
2. Mild thickening of the wall of distal descending and sigmoid
colon may be infectious or inflammatory.
3. Atrophic small kidneys with maximum craniocaudal measurement
of 7 cm.
4. Right basal effusion along with atelectasis.

[**2188-9-12**] ECHO: The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque
to 40 cm from the incisors. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The posterior aortic root is thickened
but no definite abscess is idenfitied. Trivial intraaortic
valvular regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the bioprosthetic aortic valve. A bioprosthetic mitral
valve prosthesis is present. A paravalvular mitral prosthesis
leak is present. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation
or mass is seen on the tricuspid or pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No mass or vegetation is seen on the bioprosthetic
mitral and aortic valves. There is abnormal thickening of the
posterior aortic root without any definitive abscess seen.
Moderate paravalvular mitral regurgitation.

[**2188-9-12**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] without contrast IMPRESSION:
1. Severely limited study shows no acute intracranial process.
2. Diffusely low marrow signal, consistent with marrow
hyperplasia, which
could be secondary to anemia or HIV.

[**2188-9-12**] Left upper extremity doppler - IMPRESSION: No evidence
of septic thrombus in the fistula.

[**2188-9-12**] CXR - FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube has been placed
terminating 3.8 cm above carina.  Worsening bibasilar opacities,
probably pulmonary edema and less likely aspiration, with
adjacent bilateral small pleural effusions.

[**2188-9-13**] ECG - Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2188-9-12**] the T wave abnormalities
recorded on [**2188-9-12**] are more prominent, now with T wave
inversions in lead V3. Followup and clinical correlation are
suggested.

[**2188-9-18**] CT T & L spine - final read still pending. Discussed
with radiologist and no abscess seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
31 year old gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and
h/o coag neg Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with
fevers and diarrhea, found to have Strep Viridans endocarditis.

# Strep viridans endocarditis: The patient is immunocompromised
and has a history of endocarditis. The pt had a recent admission
in [**7-/2188**] with similar symptoms. The initial differential for
his fevers was broad and included persistent low grade
endocarditis (supported by a new PR prolongation on EKG), CMV
colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C
