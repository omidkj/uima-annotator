Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2145-5-26**] for further
management of her pacemaker. The Electrophysiology service was
consulted. An interrogation was performed which showed no clear
indication of diaphragmatic stimulation. She was stable being
ventricular paced. Changes were made to the settings without
issue. A chest x-ray was obtained which likely showed that the
atrial lead was dislodged. As this had been a chronic and known
issue, no further intervention was recommended. She was thus
discharged back to rehabilitation on [**2145-5-27**].
