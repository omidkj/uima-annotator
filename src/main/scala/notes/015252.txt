Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
small bowel obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right colectomy
lysis of adhesions


History of Present Illness:
     The patient is a 43-year-old
male, status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2187**].  This
has been complicated by chronic allograft nephropathy.
However, the patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2201-5-28**] with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  The patient
progressed to have a partial bowel obstruction with KUB and
CAT scan showing partial small bowel obstruction.  However,
CAT scan was also read as having a mass in the right lower
quadrant.  The patient was managed conservatively with IV
hydration, antibiotics, as well as NG tube decompression.
However, the patient still was tender with low-grade fevers.
Therefore, the patient was screened for the operating room and
recieved right colectomy on [**2201-6-9**].
        The patient is now nine days status post
exploratory laparotomy and right colectomy for an appendiceal
phlegmon involving the cecum.  The patient admits he did well
postoperatively but he had a prolonged ileus, however, the
caliber of the patient's ileus/partial small bowel
obstruction has increased over the past 48 hours.  The
patient has had serial worsening of KUBs but considerable
distinction of his small bowel.  The patient has become more
toxic with low-grade tachycardia and tachypnea and increasing
abdominal distention with worsening of physical and x-ray
examinations as well as the general deterioration in his
clinical status.  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
for exploratory laparotomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**6-6**] CT:1. Increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions with
consolidation at both lung bases. In addition there is
opacification in the lingular region. This is consistent with
worsening multifocal pneumonia.

2. Soft tissue like mass as described above. This may be
inflammatory or represent a lymphomatous type mass. This mass
also appears to be causing a partial small bowel obstruction as
there are loops of non-dilated bowel adjacent to it as well as
other more dilated loops. This appearance of dilated bowel has
progressed compared with the prior study.

3. Increased ascites.

4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
