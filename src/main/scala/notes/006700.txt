Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39151**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-op work-up
prior to surgery. On [**7-22**] he was brought to the operating room
where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. He initially required Epinephrine, Levophed and
volume for hypotension. These medications were weaned off on
post-op day one. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Beta-blockers and
diuretics were eventually started and he was diuresed towards
his pre-op weight. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. On post-op day two he was transferred to
the step-down floor for further care. He did require reinsertion
of Foley catheter due to incomplete voiding. Flomax was started
and the patient voided successfully following removal of
catheter.  He developed a right arm phlebitis and was given warm
packs. WBC remained normal. Phlebitis resolved.  He continued to
slowly recover and work with physical therapy for strength and
mobility. On post-op day five he appeared to be doing well and
was discharged to home with VNA services. All the appropriate
medications and appointments were given.
