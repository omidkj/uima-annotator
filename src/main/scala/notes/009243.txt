Admission Date:  [**2151-3-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2151-3-28**]

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

NOTE:  This dictation will serve as an addendum to the
previously dictated discharge summary of [**2151-3-25**].

INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 6373**] Center on [**2151-3-26**].  At the time of discharge,
the patient was stable and was discharged on 100% face mask
FIO2 to aid in the resolution of her already resolving small
apical pneumothorax.  Secondary to concerns regarding the
patient's high FIO2 not withstanding her stable respiratory
status, the patient was rapidly returned from [**Hospital3 6373**] Center to [**Hospital1 69**]
on the day of prior discharge.

Upon arrival, the patient was unchanged in examination from
the time of her discharge several hours prior.  Please see
prior dictation summary for further details including
baseline examination and prior hospital course.

At the time of this dictation, the patient is awaiting again
placement for rehabilitation.

LABORATORY DATA:  A chest x-ray was performed on [**2151-3-27**],
with the following impression:  Apparent resolution of small
right apical pneumothorax. Slight improvement in the
bilateral patchy air opacities.  Right PICC should be
withdrawn approximately 3.0 centimeters.

Complete blood count at the time of readmission was as
follows:  White blood cell count 17.5, hematocrit 33.2,
platelet count 260,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.0, chloride
99, bicarbonate 31, blood urea nitrogen 12, creatinine 0.4,
glucose 114.  Calcium [**2151-3-27**], was 9.5, albumin 2.9,
globulin 3.0, magnesium 1.9, phosphate 3.7.  A TSH and SPEP
are pending at the time of discharge.

DISCHARGE PLAN:   The patient will be again discharged to
rehabilitation facility as she continues to be stable.  She
will be maintained on 40% inspired FIO2 or less at this time
as her pneumothorax has evidently resolved on the most recent
chest x-ray.  The inspired FIO2 is likely to have been
decreased by the time of the patient's actual discharge.  The
patient will follow-up with her primary care physician for
the results of PTH and SPEP testing since her transient mild
hypercalcemia which has since resolved.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. PGT q.d.
2.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.

5.  Timoptic 0.5% two drops O.U. q.d.
6.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. PGT t.i.d., hold if systolic blood
pressure less than 110.
7.  Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. PGT t.i.d.
8.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. PGT b.i.d., hold if systolic blood
pressure less than or equal to 110 or pulse less than 50.
9.  Prevacid suspension 30 cc p.o. PGT q.d.
10. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. intravenous q4hours p.r.n.
11. Respalor tube feeds 40 cc per hour.
12. Nystatin Powder topically.
13. Triple cream topically.
14. Oxygen by face mask over tracheostomy, FIO2 currently set
to 40%.

The patient will follow up at pulmonary clinic, cardiology
and the patient's primary care physician.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Resolving/resolved Streptococcal pneumonia.
2.  Status post sepsis.
3.  Status post adult respiratory distress syndrome.
4.  Status post right chest tube.
5.  Resolved right pneumothorax.
6.  History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.

which document in detail the patient's prior hospital and
Intensive Care Unit stay prior to the time of discharge
yesterday, [**2151-3-26**].
