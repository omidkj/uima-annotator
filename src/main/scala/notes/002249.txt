Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid Bronchoscope


History of Present Illness:
65 yo F COPD, recurrent PNA, non small cell lung cancer s/p
chemo and radiation in [**2175**], OSA, worsening pulmonary function,
increasing O2 requirement leading to intubation today at OSH,
sputum growing aspergillosis, and on flex bronchoscopy a fungal
ball was visualized in left main stem bronchus. At OSH she was
admitted on [**2180-5-10**] for acute onset of respiratory distress.
She was treated for bilateral lower lobe pneumonia with
ceftriaxone and azithyromycin later changed to intravenous
vancomycin and ceftazidime as well for a COPD exacerbation with
IV steriods and combivent nebs. She worsened and was put on high
flow O2, she coughed a whitish mass that was shown to be
Aspergillus by histopathology. She was placed on PO
voriconazole. She then had worsening respiratory function and
was switched to IV voriconazole. She continued wheezing and was
intubated on [**5-23**] and a felxible bronchoscopy was performed that
showed extensive endobroncial whitish mass obsturcting mainly
the Left main stem bronchus aparently biopsies of this were
consistent with the specimen that was coughed up. She also had a
CT Angio in order to determine if a PE was contributing to her
symptoms. That scan showed no PE and extensive bilateral lower
lobe infiltrates. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where she had
been previously treated in the MICU for MRSA PNA with bilateral
infiltrates and COPD in [**2180-4-10**].

IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval improvement in bibasilar consolidation, and
multifocal solid and ground-glass nodules from [**5-22**].  There
is redemonstration of mild
bronchiectasis, and marked irregular tracheal and bronchial wall
thickening, with a large amount of inspissated debris within the
left main stem bronchus and its tributaries.  Soft tissue
situated in the subcarinal location is
unchanged and may represent lymph node.
2.  Small airways disease with airtrapping.  Post-radiation
changes to the left upper lobe are constant.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo F COPD, recurrent PNA, non small cell lung cancer s/p
chemo and radiation in [**2175**], OSA was found to have invasive
aspergilloma complicated by respiratory failure requiring
intubation.

Active Diagnoses

#Respiratory failure-improved.
Multifactorial etiologies of respiratory failure requiring
intubation including COPD, PNA, and Invasive Aspergilloma.
Patient required bronchoscopy for removal of obstruction as well
as respiratory support with mechanical ventilation.  After being
successfully extubated, patient was gradually weaned to 3L
supplemental O2.

#Invasive Aspergilloma: Rigid bronchoscopy with debridment
showed large fungus ball obstructing left mainstem bronchus.
Pathology proven aspergillus along with positive B-glucan
indicative of invasive aspergilloma.  Started on Voriconazole IV
and switched to po form to avoid nephroxoticity. Pt. then
developed worsening LFTs and was switched to Ambisome IV, with
subsequent improvement of her LFTs.  She is to continue ambisome
until [**2180-7-7**].

#COPD exacerbation: PT with chronic COPD, requiring high dose
steroids for nearly 2 months.  Patient has been tapered to
steroid dose of 15mg PO daily.  Will continue at 15mg PO daily
for 5 total days, then 10mg for 5 days, then 5mg for 5 days,
then discontinue. Patient was switched from albuterol and
ipratropium nebulizers to MDIs, with good control.

#HCAP:  Pt found to have PNA at OSH, completed 14 days of
antibiotic therapy in house for suspected HCAP.

#Venous acccess:  Non-occlusive thrombosis noted in left upper
extremity after difficulty using left PICC line. Right PICC was
attempted, however was only able to get midline, which
subsequently did not draw and then did not allow pushing fluids.
 At discharge, a midline was placed.

#Depression: Patient had flat affect and psychomotor retardation
throughout stay in hospital.  It is highly advised that patient
be followed up for depression
-continue citalopram.

#Anxiety: patient was anxious daily during her hospital stay,
sometimes causing tachycardia.  Patient responded well to ativan
0.5mg IV.  Would benefit from outpatient management of anxiety.

Chronic Diagnoses
#HTN
-Pt was hypotensive during the course of her MICU stay likely
[**12-30**] effects of sedation from propofol during intubation.
Levophed was required.  Cortisol levels normal. Anti
hypertensives were not required in house.  Patient should be
re-evaluate for hypertension as an outpatient.

#Stage IIIb Non small cell lung cancer
-Pt diagnosed 3 years ago now s/p chemo & XRT. NO acute relapse
noted in this admission.

#OSA:
-After extubation, pt continued to use CPAP nightly as she does
at home.

#Diabetes Mellitus:
-Pt's po meds were held, she was managed on SSI
