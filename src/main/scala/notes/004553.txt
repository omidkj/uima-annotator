Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Fractured right hip (two-part intertrochanteric fracture)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Operative repair of right two-part intertrochanteric
hip fracture with dynamic hip screw, with procedure complicated
by  intraoperative cardiac arrhythmia and post-surgical upper
extremity weakness which appears to be resolving


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 82 y/o Man with a history CAD (s/p CABG in
[**2122**]), PVD, AAA s/p repair in [**2123**], ESRD on HD, severe spinal
and lumbar stenosis, transferred to medicine after ORIF of a
right hip fracture, complicated by intraoperative cardiac
arrhythmia and post-surgical upper extremity weakness which
appears to be resolving.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] was in in usual state of health until Monday ([**9-22**])
morning when, while in his motorized wheelchair at home, he
attempted to reach for a watch that he had dropped on the ground
and fell out of his chair. He denies any loss of consciousness
during the fall and was able to get back into the chair. He
began to develop worsening pain in his right leg several hours
later, and presented to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital for evaluation
where a CT scan demonstrated a right intratrochanteric fracture.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for ORIF that day.
.
During positioning on the OR table on [**9-22**] he had NSVT for ~3
beats (no strip available), followed by monomorphic sustained VT
with hypotension (SBP of ~40) during preparation of the
operation site. He received 1x300 Joule shock with return to
sinus rhythym, followed shortly by recurrence of SMVT, was
shocked again with 1x300 joules and again returned to sinus
rhythm. The operation was aborted and he was transferred to CCU
for further management.
.
In the CCU, post-op electrolytes were drawn and were normal,and
he was started on amiodarone. An echocardiogram showed new
posterior and inferior wall abnormalities compared to a previous
echo ([**2131-2-13**]), with a LEVF of 40-50%.  EKG did not show any
evidence of new infarct.  He was cleared for surgery the
following day when no new arrhythmias developed.
.
On [**9-23**] he successfully underwent ORIF but experienced
postoperative weakness. Per OMR and patient, his weakness was
diffuse in both the upper and lower extremities, but was most
prominent in his deltoids bilaterally (1+/5 L deltoid strength,
0/5 R deltoid strength). Neurosurgery was consulted, and noted
subjective and objective improvement in muscular strength
compared to previous neurological exam, but with persistent
diffuse weakness. He was placed in a C-spine collar and received
CT C-spine per neurosurgery recommendations which showed
substantial narrowing of spinal canal which could represent old
stenosis but would be potentially worrisome for acute cord
impingement. During this time, patient's neuro exam gradually
resolved with improved L arm strength, then R arm strength,
ultimately with improvement to what patient states is his
baseline.

STUDIES:
========
HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS RIGHT ([**2132-9-21**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Faint lucency at the right hip suggesting intertrochanteric
fracture.
2. Extensive degenerative change.
3. Atherosclerotic disease.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


CT head/c-spine ([**2132-9-23**]):

IMPRESSION: No acute fracture. A bone fragment in the
posterolateral canal
on the right at T2 is likely chronic in etiology, although not
unambiguously characterized in this study.

2. Florid degenerative changes predispose this patient to spinal
cord trauma with minor injury. Recommend MR for further
evaluation.
