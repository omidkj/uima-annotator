Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU wtih CHF exacerbation.

1. CHF - The patient appeared to be volume overloaded on exam.
The causes of his congestive heart falilure was presumed to be a
combination of severe aortic insufficinecy (worsened form [**6-4**])
and possibly a fib with RVR. The patient was initially diuresed
with Lasix and Metolazone while Milrenone was started to
maintain renal perfusion. He initially seemed to respond well to
diuresis. Then his urine output had declined and he required
Lasix and Niseritide drips to keep I/O negative. The patient was
about 7 L negative for the length of stay, when he developed
acute renal failure with rise in Cr from 1.2 to 2.1 secondary to
intravascular volume depletion. Diuresis was stopped although
the patient still appeared volume overloaded. The patient's
condition continued to decline and he deveoped Cheyene-[**Doctor Last Name **]
respirations with long periods of apnea/tachypnea.

2. A fib, chronic, on coumadin since late [**6-4**]. The patient has
been in a fib during this admission. He was cardioverted x2 in
the past (went for TEE/DCCV [**7-5**]), but did not remain in sinus
rhythm. The decision was made not to attempt another
cardioversion. The patient was monitored on telemetry. He had
been rate-controlled. The patient was continued on digoxin and
was started on amiodarone in anticipation that he may be a
candidate for cardioversion in the future. Mr. [**Known lastname 57846**] INR was
initially supratherapeutic. Coumadin was stopped and the patient
was anticoagulated with heparin drip for the duration of
hospitalization.

3. Aortic insufficiency - CT surgery was consulted. They did not
feel that the patient would be a candidate for AVR during this
hospitalization, but AVR would be an option if he will continue
to do well.

4. Chronic R pleural effusion [**1-2**] CHF - This felt to be
contributing to the patient's shortness of breath. Thoracentesis
was performed on [**7-14**] and 2200 cc of serosanguenous fluid,
transudative was drained. Cytology, gram stain and culture were
all negative. Thoracentesis x 2 previously showed results c/w
transudative effusion, cytology negative. The patient felt
subjectively better after the thoracentesis, however, on [**7-18**],
CXR showed reaccumulation.

5. MRSA bacteremia - Presumably from RIJ line although RIJ tip
culture was negative. The central line was changed. Blood Cx (fr
[**7-9**]) 4/4 bottles w/MRSA. Started Vancomycin on [**7-10**]. The
patient has remained febrile with normal WBC. Surveilance blood
cultures had been negative.

12. MS changes- The patient had been weak and lethargic. He
became more somnolent on [**7-22**]. The patient was made DNR/DNI in
agreement with decision of the family. However, his condition
continued to deteriorate and on the morning of [**7-23**], after
discussion with the family, the patient's code status was
changed to CMO. The patient expired at 7:15 pm. Cause of death
pulmonary failure secondary to end stage congestive heart
failure.
