Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2152-8-31**] Mr.[**Known lastname 2479**] was taken to the Operating Room and
underwent aortic valve replacement with a 27-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna
Ease bioprosthesis and replacement of ascending aorta and
proximal hemiarch with a 28 mm Vascutek Dacron graft using deep
hypothermic circulatory arrestand pericardial reconstruction
with CorMatrix by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please refer to operative note for
further details.

He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU
intubated and sedated. He awoke neurologically intact and was
weaned to extubation without difficulty. All lines and drains
were discontinued in a timely fashion. Beta- blocker, Aspirin
and a statin and diuresis were initiated. The Pain Service was
consulted for recommendations for pain control because of his
polysubstance abuse.  He continued to progress and was
transferred to the step down unit on POD#1 for further
monitoring.

Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. The remainder of his postoperative course was
essentially uneventful. His pain was well controlled on Dilaudid
and his baseline Methadone by discharge.  Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] cleared him
for discharge to home on POD# 4. All follow up appointments were
advised.
