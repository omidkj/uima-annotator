ECG
[**10-18**]
Sinus rhythm. Prolonged P-R interval. Inferior and lateral ST-T
wave changes are likely due to left ventricular hypertrophy with
repolarization abnormality, although cannot exclude myocardial
ischemia.
[**10-26**]
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Low voltages in the limb leads.
Compared to the previous tracing the atrial fibrillation is new.

.
CXR [**2171-10-24**]:
Small right greater than left pleural effusions are new.
Otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal opacity. The heart
is top normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
Status post aortic and mitral valve replacement with sternotomy
wires seen. There is calcification of the aortic arch.


Brief Hospital Course:
77F on Coumadin for AVR/MVR who developed melena and fatigue
while on Lovenox bridge to Coumadin after recent eye surgery and
was found to have severe anemia and bleeding esophageal ulcer.
.
# UGIB: Presented with melena and fatigue while on Lovenox
bridge to Coumadin after recent eye surgery. Found to have
anemia (see below) which was treated with multiple PRBC
transfusions. In ED NG lavage was positive and did not clear,
She was put on IV Protonix, got PRBC X 3 and transferred to the
ICU. Anticoagulation was continued throughout her hospital
course for mechanical AVR/MVR. Had EGD [**10-19**] which showed distal
esophageal ulcer with visible bleeding vessel on a Schatzki's
ring which was clipped. H. pylori serology - negative. Did not
have history suggestive of NSAID ulcers or pill esophagitis.
Transferred to the medicine floor [**10-20**] for continued care where
she continued to have melanous stool and down trending Hct.
Re-scoped [**10-22**] with oozing from the same site treated with
epinephrin and blind-clipping X5 as could not visualize vessel.
Subsequently on IV Protonix drip had stable Hct and resolution
of melena. Discharged with PO Protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]  for 8 weeks.
Will likely need second look endoscopy with biopsies.
.
# Anemia: Admitted with symptomatic normocytic anemia Hct 18
secondary to UGIB. Required several PRBC transfusions throughout
her stay. Last Hct on morning of discharge was 24.4 following
which she received another unit of PRBC. She will require close
Hct follow up in the out-patient setting.
.
# Valvular Heart Disease s/p Valve replacements with Mechanical
Aortic and Mitral Valves. Last echocardiography demonstrated
normal cardiac valve and cavity function and size and mild PHTN.
Was on IV heparin [**Last Name (un) **] throughout her admission and finally
bridged back to Warfarin. Discharged on Warfarin 3mg daily. INR
at discharge = 2.6. Will continue INR monitoring with PCP.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: history of Paroxysmal AF. At home was on
Coumadin for stroke prevention and rate controlled with
Diltiazem XL 240mg daily. Diltiazem was initially held due to
risk of cardiac decompensation in the setting of acute blood
loss. On [**10-24**] she had one episode of asymptomatic AF with RVR
which spontaneously converted to sinus. Diltiazem was
subsequently restarted. She was discharged on her home dose of
Diltiazem 240 XL. Bystolic was held on admission and continues
to be held at discharge as seems to be well rate and BP
controlled.
.
# Fever: [**10-23**] single spike of fever to 101.1 which did not
reccur. Infectious workup including UA neg and CXR were non
revealing for infectious source. Blood cultures were negative.
Fever quickly resolved no Abx were administered.
.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure: Admitted with Cr 1.7 with
unkown baseline. Likely pre-renal failure [**1-15**] to hypovolemia
from acute blood loss. Downtrended with IVF and PRBC to 1.2
which is probably her baseline. Will continued renal function
monitoring in the outpatient setting.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: developed thrombocytopenia to 101 likely due
to consumption in the setting of acute UGIB as well as dilution
from repeated PRBC transfusion. This was resolved at discharge.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Stable. Home hypoglycemics were held on
admission and she was treated with Insulin fixed dose + ISS.
Discharged on Home regimen of oral hypoglycemics + Lantus
insulin.
.
# Bil Pulmonary effusions: found incidentally on CXR [**10-24**].
Etiology unclear, possibly [**1-15**] to some cardiac decompensation in
the setting of anemia. Will need repeat CXR in 6 weeks.
