Admission Date:  [**2133-7-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2133-7-10**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old
man with history of hypertension, coronary artery disease
with three vessel disease status post cath, recent syncopal
episode, arrhythmia status post pacemaker placement who
presented to ER in respiratory distress.  The patient was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for
syncopal episode on [**2133-6-17**].  Prior to syncopal event, the
patient had unusual feeling in chest with palpitations.
Syncopal work-up suggested cardiac etiology.  A cath was done
on [**2133-6-18**] which revealed three vessel disease, the left main
was 20% occluded distally, LAD 80% at bifurcation of
diagonal, left circumflex 50% occlusion at proximal, RCA had
total occlusion with filling from left to right collaterals.
An echo at that time showed an EF greater than 55%, mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, no AR, 1+ MR,
mild symmetric LVH and borderline pulmonary hypertension.
EKG was suggestive of prior inferior wall infarct at that
time showing Q's in 3 and AVF.  During the hospital course
the patient had a new onset atrial fibrillation and DDD
pacemaker was placed and patient was started on Amiodarone.
Since discharge over the past two weeks, the patient has been
very fatigued, had difficulty sleeping.  He went to the
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] on [**7-3**] where pacemaker was
interrogated and one episode of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation was noted on the pacer.  The patient was
switched from Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] to Toprol 25 mg q d in
order to improve his sleeping.  Wife says that patient's
sleeping did improve over the last couple nights since
switching medication.  Over the last couple of weeks the
patient has also been complaining of neck and shoulder bone
pain, chills and spells in which he reportedly looked [**Doctor Last Name 352**],
according to the wife.  The patient had not had any
palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, but
occasional ankle swelling.  He had reportedly been feeling
good on day of admission, went to bed and then starting
getting short of breath.  The shortness of breath
progressively worsened and patient was brought to the
Emergency Room.  The patient denied chest pain at the time.
In the Emergency Room his blood pressure was found to be
200/117, pulse 130, respiratory rate 50, O2 saturation 91% on
100% non rebreather.  The patient was alert but very agitated
on physical exam.  He was noted to have bilateral diffuse
crackles [**1-25**] of the way up.  EKG at the time showed sinus
tachy with questionable ST elevations in V1 and V2.  The
patient was put on C-pap and given Morphine and Ativan for
agitation and Lasix and started on Nitro drip.  His blood
pressure fell and he was taken off the Nitro drip.  His
respiratory rate fell with the C-pap and his O2 sats
improved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes hypertension, coronary artery
disease, syncopal event, atrial fibrillation, right colon
cancer, status post resection in [**2099**], left colon cancer
status post resection in [**2115**], benign prostate hyperplasia
status post prostatectomy in [**2116**], thalamic bleed secondary
to hypertension in [**2125**] and a renal mass, hemorrhagic cyst in
[**2129**].

ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor which causes angioedema.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is an ex-smoker, used to smoke 2-3 packs
per day, quit in [**2131**].  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] had been
the chief of pediatrics at [**Hospital3 **] but then was a general
pediatrician at [**Hospital3 1810**] and is now retired.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medications include Amiodarone 200
mg q d, Fluconazole 100 mg q d, Nystatin 100,000 units, [**3-28**]
ml qid and Toprol 25 mg q d.  In the hospital the patient was
given Morphine 4 mg, Lasix 200 mg IV, Ativan 2 mg and the
Nitro drip.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a pulse of 79, blood
pressure 139/85, respiratory rate 19, pulse ox 100% on C-pap.
He was lying in bed, sedated with C-pap mask on with deep
breathing and no acute distress.  He had positive external
jugular but no internal JVP was discernible.  No carotid
bruit was appreciated.  His rate was regular S1 and S2 with
questionable S4, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs had
diffuse crackles, expiratory rhonchi and rales ?????? way up.  His
abdomen was soft, positive bowel sounds, nontender, non
distended, trace edema, 2+ radial pulses, DP pulses not
palpable.  Neuro, patient was sedated, was not responding to
commands.

LABORATORY DATA:  On his admission his labs were white blood
count 12.9, up from 7.5 on [**7-1**], hematocrit 34.8, up from
31.3 on [**7-1**] and platelet count 405,000 with MCV of 86.  His
neutrophils were 70%, lymphs 21%, monocytes 2.9% and
eosinophils 4.4%.  Sodium 138, potassium 5.8, 106/22, 36/2.0
and 239 for glucose.  His creatinine had been baseline at 1.6
to 1.8.  His ABG at 2:30 a.m. was 7.3, 44, 229.  His PT was
12.4, PTT 25.9.  On his prior admission the patient was noted
to have iron of 25, TIBC 260, TSH was 1.3 and free T4 1.0.
Retic count 1.7, Vitamin B12 327, Folate greater than 20.
His hemoglobin A1C was 6.0.  His CEA was elevated at 11.  On
prior admission the patient's peak CPK was 127 and his peak
troponin was 11.2.  His EKG on admission was heart rate 130,
sinus tachy, no axis deviation, ST depressions in V5, V6 and
1 and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in V1 through V3.  Chest x-ray was
consistent with CHF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has known coronary artery
disease, he was started on Aspirin.  Heparin was initially
held secondary to his history of thalamic bleed and the fact
that he had guaiac positive stools on his last admission on
[**6-17**].  Beta blockers were also initially held secondary to
his CHF.  On admission his CPK was 141 and troponin 2.3.  The
next day his CPK dropped to 129 but the MB was up at 17 with
index of 13.2.  His troponin peaked at 20.  The patient was
started on IV Heparin.  His cath was reviewed two weeks
earlier and showed severe three vessel disease with 90%
lesions in the LAD and total occlusion of the RCA and 70% of
left circumflex.  Possible options were discussed with him
including surgical, PCI and medical management.  It was
agreed upon that the patient would give a trial of medical
management for the time being and if he became symptomatic,
he would then go for PCI.  During the hospital course his EKG
returned to [**Location 213**] in terms of ST elevation.  He had no
longer had shortness of breath or chest pain and IV Heparin
was discontinued and patient was started on beta blocker.
The patient had no symptoms of angina or chest pain or
shortness of breath during the rest of this hospital course.

Pump:  Since his chest x-ray was consistent with CHF, the
patient was started on Lasix and diuresed 2?????? liters over the
first 2 days of his hospital course.  His respiratory status
significantly improved with the diuresis.  An echo was done
on the first day of admission and it showed an EF of 30-40%
LV systolic function moderately depressed, symmetric LVH,
severe hypokinesis of anterior septum and anterior free wall,
extensive apical HK, AK, no aortic stenosis, no AR, 1+ MR,
pulmonary artery systolic pressure was normal and no
pericardial effusion was noted.  Compared to the
echocardiogram done on [**6-17**], his overall LV function was
significantly worse secondary to a major anterior septal
infarct/injury.  Along with beta blocker, patient was started
on Isordil, initially 10 mg tid, then 20 mg tid.  He was
later switched to Imdur 30 mg q d for discharge.  Long-term
anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis was determined to be
unnecessary and would be too risky due to the patient's
history of thalamic bleeding.

Rate & Rhythm:  The next morning after admission the patient
was noted to be in atrial fibrillation.  EP was called and
interrogated his  pacemaker device which showed that the
patient was in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 6% of the time.
He was started on 25 mg of Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], however, during
the course
