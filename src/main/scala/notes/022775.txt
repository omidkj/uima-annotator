Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Increase fatigue and nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year old right handed woman with a
history of chronic atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin who
converted from sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation 2 weeks PTA,
symptomatic sinus bradycardia s/p PPM [**9-12**], and hypertension who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**7-8**] with DOE and 2 days of hoarse voice, and
was found to have nystagmus at right endgaze, flattening of the
right NLF, and right arm>leg weakness called by Neurology as a
CODE STROKE.

She was admitted to the Cardiology service on [**7-8**] with increased
fatigue, SOB and DOE, dizziness headache, nausea, and voice
change. She reported 3 months of DOE and is only able to walk a
few steps before becoming symptomatic, 2 weeks of
nausea/vomiting
without abdominal pain (which the patient thought was due to
recently starting Atenolol). The patient triggered for nursing
concern on [**7-8**] at 23:06, as she had altered mental status and
was
vomiting. She was tachcardic to 120-140 thought to be atrial
fibrillation with RVR, and was given Metoprolol 2.5 mg IV x1,
and
started on Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO q6 hr. The patient was noted to
be "A&O x3". On [**2197-7-9**] at 0120, the patient was found to be more
fatigued than before, felt weak, and was "unable [to] vocally
commuicate can only mouth silently answers." Exam at that time
showed "CN intact, good grip, no pronator drift, A&O x3." The
patient's daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**], and reported that upon
admission the patient has been disoriented with difficulty
communicating due to hoarseness of her voice. Given her
disorientation (although note said A&O x3) and history of atrial
fibrillation, head CT was obtained which showed new hypodensity
in the right cerebellar hemisphere suggestive of infarction
subacute to to chronic in age, multiple prior infarcts
throughout
the cerebral hemispheres largely unchanged, no evidence of acute
hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures, and mild
brain atrophy. Upon primary cardiology team evaluation today at
7:30 am, she was noted to have difficulty lifting her right arm
against gravity, but could move her right leg against gravity.
The nurse reported that the patient has been having trouble
swallowing her pills. The nurse also was the same one who took
care of the patient the day before, and said that her voice was
not hoarse as of [**7-8**] at 3:00 pm. Neurology was consulted, and
this author called a code stroke at 10:15 given her
constellation
of symptoms.

The patient reports that she thinks the right arm weakness
started "hours" ago. She currently denies numbness, headache,
diplopia, dysphagia. She denies fevers/chills, pain/burning on
urination, cough/cold, diarrhea. She reports not taking a daily
Aspirin at home.

Per the patient's daughter, the patient has not had
nausea/vomiting over the past weak. She has had a hoarse voice
since last Thursday. She has been unsteady on her feet at home,
which sounds like a chronic issue.
