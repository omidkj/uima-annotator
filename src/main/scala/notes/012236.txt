Date of Birth:   [**2068-2-26**]       Sex:  M

Service:   CCU/C-Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year old
male with multiple cardiac risk factors including
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco and a family history
who presented to an outside hospital on the morning of
[**2116-1-6**] after experiencing the onset of "[**11-23**]" chest pain
beginning at rest at 3 a.m. with associated nausea and
diaphoresis.  The patient states that he developed upper
respiratory tract infection symptoms approximately two days
prior to this presentation which included sputum and fevers.
Later that same evening, he developed severe chest pain at 1
in the morning which was "heavy" and occurred in bursts of
[**4-23**] minutes diminishing spontaneously.  The patient was able
to sleep comfortably that evening however on the following
morning, at 3 a.m., he woke up with severe chest pain.  He
subsequently presented to [**Hospital 47**] Hospital Emergency
Department there.  There he was found to have a temperature
of 101.  EKG revealed an extreme right axis pole, R waves in
V1 through V3, ST segment depressions in V1 through V3 and ST
segment elevations of approximately 0.5 millimeters in V5 to
V6, I and L.  He had his CK checked which was greater than
3000 with an MB of 185, a troponin was greater than 50.  He
was started on IV nitroglycerin, IV heparin, however he still
continued to have 4/10 chest pain at which time, Integrilin
was added.  The patient's chest pain persisted.  A STAT
echocardiogram was done which revealed an ejection fraction
of 40%, lateral wall akinesis, posterolateral hypokinesis.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **]
Hospital for emergent cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hyperlipidemia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Cervical disk herniations status post surgery X4.
4.  Status post right orbit reconstruction.
5.  Status post left total knee replacement.

MEDICATIONS ON PRESENTATION TO OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:
1.  Pravachol, dose unknown.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide, dose unknown.
3.  Percocet, dose unknown.
4.  Atenolol, dose unknown.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient had a father who had a coronary
artery bypass graft at age 56, had a brother who died age 42
of a cardiac arrest/myocardial infarction.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is unemployed and lives on
disability.  He lives with his family and has two children.

nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities -
Without lower extremity edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally, right groin sheath is in place, clean, dry and
intact.  Neurologically, alert and oriented X3, cranial
nerves III-XII intact.

LABORATORY:  On presentation, WBC 17.9, hematocrit 37.6,
platelets 232, MCV 100.  SMA-7 - Sodium 138, potassium 3.8,
chloride 101, bicarbonate 26, BUN 16, creatinine .9, glucose
112.  PT/INR 1.3, PTT 57.3.  CK - 3049.  ABG - 7.3/941/113.

EKG - Pre-catheterization showed sinus with a rate 75 and
extreme right axis, normal intervals, [**12-17**] millimeter ST
segment depressions in I, L.  Tall R's in V1 through V4, Q's
in I, L, V5 and V6.  Post stent EKG - Sinus tach with a rate
of 100, right axis deviation, normal intervals, tall R's in
V1 through V4 and Q's in V5 and V6.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was emergently
transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] Hospital from [**Hospital 47**]
Hospital with evidence of an evolving acute lateral wall
myocardial infarction.  He was noted to be hemodynamically
stable however.  The patient emergently presented to the
cardiac catheterization lab where he was noted to have a
normal left main and LAD with 90% small D1, left circ with
100% occlusion of a large OM1 which was noted to have
thrombus in distal extension.  His coronary artery had less
than 40% luminal stenosis.  The patient underwent angio-jet
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent of
his large OM1.  He was noted to have elevated pressures in
the catheterization lab which included a RA pressure of 20, a
PA pressure of 65/30, a wedge of 32 and a RV pressure of
45/20.  The patient was transferred to the CCU Service
following his intervention.  He was maintained on Integrilin
X18 hours, IV nitroglycerin for blood pressure control, IV
heparin and Plavix.  He also received aspirin, small doses of
Lopressor which were titrated as he was weaned from the IV
nitroglycerin, and small doses of an Ace inhibitor.  He was
aggressively diuresed on the first two hospital days given
his elevated left heart filling pressures during
catheterization.  He was monitored on telemetry without
evident.  His CK's peaked at 3225 with an MB of 118 and an
index of 3.7.  This index was down from his first CK which
was 3049 with an MB of 158 and an index of 5.2.  In addition,
the patient had a fasting lipid panel checked.  He was noted
to have a normal cholesterol and LDH of 95 and HDL of 34.
Since his normal outpatient anti-hyperlipidemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was not
on formulary, he was transiently put on Lipitor throughout
his hospitalization.  After the patient was felt to be stable
from a cardiac standpoint, he was transferred from the CCU to
11 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] where he continued to be monitored.  He had serial
EKG's performed which revealed persistent tall R waves in V1
through V2, Q. waves in I, L, V5 and V6 and mild ST segment
elevations of [**12-17**] to 1.5 millimeters in V2through V6.  An
echocardiogram was performed on the morning of hospital day
#4, revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, bilateral atrial
enlargement, mild global RV hypokinesis, LVH with a dilated
LV cavity, and segmental LV wall motion abnormalities
specifically akinesis in the inferoposterior lateral
segments.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was somewhat complicated by
intermittent episodes of chest pain which occurred 1-2X a day
both at rest and with exertion.  The symptoms were often
quite nebulous in presentation and were never corresponding
to the pain which brought him to [**Hospital 47**] Hospital.  They
were occasionally associated with shortness of breath but
there was never associated nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
The episodes were never associated with EKG changes and were
never relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  IV Morphine
sulfate was the only medication which seemed to relieve the
symptoms.  After long discussions with the Cardiology team
involved in this patient's care, it was decided that these
were highly unlikely to represent post myocardial infarction
angina or acute ischemic events.  The patient's normal doses
of pain medications specifically Percocet which he takes for
low back pain was titrated for improved relief and he
subsequently remained symptom free.

The patient also had multiple other issues arise throughout
his hospital course.  First off, the patient was noted to
have a leukocytosis, cough and sputum production on
presentation.  Repeat chest x-rays never revealed evolution
of infiltrates, consolidations or effusions.  His sputum was
sent for culture however the sample was noted to have greater
than 10 epithelial cells in addition to greater than 25
PMN's.  There was no one predominant organism cultured from
his sputum.  His symptoms were perceived to be most likely
consistent with a tracheobronchitis in this known smoker.  He
was treated with Levaquin X5 days with slow resolution of his
sym
