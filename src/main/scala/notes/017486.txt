Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71 year old male with h/o CRI, HTN, hypercholesterolemia,
presents with 5 episodes of syncope without prodrome. 3 mos ago,
Maxzide was increased from 1-2 tabs daily, then 1.5 months ago,
his creatinine increased from 2.1-2.5. He then presented to his
PCPs office with 20 lb weight loss, fatigue, dry heaves, and
abdominal pain. Labs revealed Cr 7.2, K 4, HCO3 14, prompting
referral to the ED for further evaluation. In the ED, sbp 80s,
prompting volume resuscitation, bedside U/S was performed (no
evidence of pericardial effusion/tamponade), and he received
levofloxacin/flagyl and decadron prior to admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for further management.

Radiology
[**7-6**] Abd CT1. Mild aneurysmatic dilatation of the infrarenal
aorta with a maximum diameter of 2.5 cm. 3-mm pulmonary nodule
in the right lower lobe.
Multiple bilateral renal cysts. Cholelithiasis. Diverticulosis
without diverticulitis.

[**7-7**] RUQ U/S: Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

[**7-7**] renal U/S: : Multiple renal cysts without hydronephrosis or

[**7-8**] TTE: 1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are  normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic root is
mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation. 1+ MR. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yoM w/ h/o CRI (Cr 1.9-2.1), HTN, and hypercholesterolemia
initially admitted [**2111-7-7**] with syncope (5 episodes w/o
prodrome), N/V, abd pain. Given hypotension, he was admitted to
the ICU, where he received IVF and was transferred to the
general floor [**7-8**]. Over the evening of the [**7-8**], he developed
increased O2 requirement, requiring repeat ICU admission [**7-9**].
His hypoxia was attributed to CHF in the setting of volume
resuscitation. He was diuresed gently and transferred back to
the general floor [**7-11**].

Summary of hospital course by problem:

1) Abdominal pain: Most likely secondary to pancreatitis in the
setting of hypotension/dehydration, given elevated lipase on
admission. The patient was initially kept NPO with IVF.
Abdominal pain resolved. Abdomen CT (-), RUQ U/S with
choleltithiasis, no cholecystitis.

2) Acute renal failure: Cr 7.2 on admission from baseline
1.9-2.1. On time Most likely secondary to ATN, given muddy brown
casts on urine sediment. Cause of ATN was most likely profound
dehydration/hypotension in the setting of poor PO intake and
diuretic use. With supportive management of fluid status,
creatinine gradually returned to baseline (1.9 at time of
discharge). He should have outpatient renal follow-up following
discharge from rehabilitation facility

3) Syncopal episodes: Although these did not have a clear
prodrome, they were most likely secondary to orthostasis in the
setting of dehydration (diuretic use, poor PO intake)
exacerbated by uremia in the setting of acute renal failure.
Telemetry monitoring did not reveal any arrhythmias, only
notable for sinus tachycardia which improved with hydration.
Echocardiogram [**7-8**] with EF >55%, 1+ MR, trace AR, mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Given the patient's
reported weight loss, a malignancy work-up was initiated. PSA
was elevated at 4.5 (see below). UPEP/SPEP were negative. CXR
was without evidence of mass. The patient reports his last
colonoscopy was a year ago (polyps, unknown if adenomas); he
would benefit from an outpatient colonoscopy.

4) Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient returned to
the ICU [**7-9**] for hypoxia; CXR was consistent with CHF, most
likely secondary to volume resucitation and demand ischemia. As
mentioned above, TTE showed EF >55%; he was gently diuresed and
oxygen was titrated to off. He was continued on low dose
metoprolol. He would benefit in the future from addition of
afterload reduction, either ACEI (currently limited by recent
ranal failure) or hydral/imdur (currently limited by sbp, which
is in the 110s).

5) Demand ischemia: The patient's troponin peaked on [**7-9**] at
2.31. He was transiently on heparin, which was discontinued in
the ICU, given this was felt to be secondary to demand ischemia
rather than ACS. He was continued on ASA, statin, lipitor.

6) Macrocytic anemia: HCT 25 from 36 on admit (likely
hemoconcentrated on admission). This was macrocytic, hawever
B12/folate were within normal limits. Given likely contributor
of chronic kidney disease, epogen was initiated. His HCT should
be checked on a weekly basis in the rehab to ensure stability

7) Elevated PSA: PSA, obtained as part of a malignancy work-up
was 4.5. This may, in part, be secondary to recent Foley
placement. This should be repeated as an outpatient and referral
for outpatient urology work-up considered
