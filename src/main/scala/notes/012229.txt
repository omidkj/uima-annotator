pulm: Pt c/o pain in chest but without respiratory
embarrassment, able to maintain own airway
NCAT, CTA B, TTP in left chest, minimal anterior flail segment
without immediately obvious respiratory embarassment
CV: RRR
abdomen: S/NT/ND abd

Pertinent Results:
CT Cspine: No acute cervical fracture or malalignment. 3-mm
right upper lobe ground glass nodule for which 12-month follow
up CT is recommended if there are risk factors (smoking or
malignancy history); otherwise no further follow up is needed.

CT head: 1. No acute intracranial injury. 2. Age-related atrophy
and an old lacunar infarct. Minimal microvascular ischemic
disease.

CT torso: 1. No acute vascular injury. No acute solid organ
injury. No CTee air. No pneumoperitoneum. 2. Multilevel
minimally displaced left rib fractures. Multilevel compression
fractures, most severe at T11 and L1. Minimally displaced
manubrial fracture. 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with
mild bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Moderate hiatal hernia.
4. Moderate pneumobilia, predominantly in the left hepatic lobe,
secondary to prior sphincterotomy. 5. 7-mm right renal
hypodensity, incompletely assessed. An ultrasound can be
obtained for further evaluation. 6. 2-mm right middle lobe
pulmonary nodule. If the patient has a prior history of
malignancy or smoking, then 1 year CT follow up is recommended;
otherwise no further follow up imaging is needed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77751**] was admitted to the Trauma Surgery service for
pain management and pulmonary toilet. She was placed on her home
medications and given a regular diet. She did fairly well on the
floor initially, but was plagued by pewrsistent left chest pain
despite pain medication. She was therefore seen by anesthesia
for placement of an epidural catheter. On Hospital Day 4
however, the patient was noted to be complaining of dizziness
and sleepiness. A blood pressure was unable to be obtained
although she was mentating appropriately. Her HR was noted to be
38, and O2 saturation 88% on 2LNC. A 'code blue' was called and
the patient was transferred to the Trauma SICU for further care.


Her hospital course can be summarized by systems as follows:
Neuro: her mental status was fully intact at the time of
presentation, but worsened following the aforementioned code and
never really fully resolved thereafter.  She remained intubated
and sedated for the vast majority of her hospital stay, and even
after tracheostomy she never fully awoke.  She would move all
four extremities without focal neurologic deficits and would
only occasionally open her eyes to commands, but her overall
mental status remained poor and did not improve in any
significant way.  In order to improve her oxygenation and
respiratory status, she was placed on paralysis during the week
of [**6-14**] but this was discontinued on [**2173-6-16**].

Respiratory: Due to increased work of breathing as well as her
central flail, the patient was unable to meet her own
respiratory needs. She ultimately underwent elective intubation
on [**2173-5-7**]. Due to inability to wean from the vent, she underwent
tracheostomy on [**2173-5-18**] at the bedside, which was uneventful.
She developed clinically significant bilateral pleural
effusions, for which chest tubes were placed in the OR on
[**2173-5-27**] which were subsequently removed.  She underwent R
thoracentesis ast one point and also part of the rationale for
the reduction of her paraesophogeal hernia was the hope it would
improve ventilatory function.  Her overall pulmonary status
never improved however and she did not wean from the ventilator.
 Specifically, she remained on near full ventilatory support and
never tolerated trach collar trials.  She had multiple episodes
of culture-proven pneumonia, including fungal pneumonia and
Klebsiella pneumonia.  She was treated with a number of courses
of antibiotics, the last of which was meropenem and linezolid.

CV: For her bradycardia, the patient was placed at various times
on dopamine or epinephrine drips in order to keep her rate up.
She intermittently went from bradycardia to rapid afib requiring
multiple rounds of electrical and chemical cardioversion. During
one of her episodes of bradycardia, she had a brief episode of
asystole requiring compressions with restoration of a rhythm
approximately a minute later. Cardiology and EP had been
consulted and had been following along. Because of the episode
of asystole, the patient ultimately underwent placement of a
temporary pacing wire for suspected tachy-brady/sick sinus
syndrome. She intermittently required pressors for blood
pressure support but was eventually able to be weaned off.  Her
external pacemaker was planned to be internalized by the
electrophysiology service, but she never became clinically well
enough for this to happen.  She remained paced throughout the
course of her hospital stay, and required intermittent but
ultimately escalating vasopressor support over the week of [**6-14**].


GI: After intubation, the patient was initially receiving tube
feeds via an OG tube.  She had a known hiatal hernia and had
intermittent difficulty tolerating tube feeds for this reason.
Discussion was undertaken with the family regarding the need for
nutritional support, and she ultimately underwent open G-tube
placement on [**2173-5-27**] with pull-down of the paraesophageal
hernia.  Post-operatively, the patient initially tolerated her
tube feeds at goal without difficulty, but then developed high
residuals from her g-tube and sigificant constipation.  After
many aggressive measures to facilitate a bowel movement
including a gastrograffin enema, she did in fact move her bowels
but never really tolerated tube feeds well.

Renal: She was significantly fluid overloaded throughout most of
her hospital stay, requiring aggressive diuresis and a lasix
drip.  This improved her volume status significantly, but she
ultimately developed renal failure that was progressive on the
week of [**6-14**].  She became severely oliguric, and her creatinine
continued to rise to a level of > 2.0.  It was felt that she
would require hemodialysis for renal replacement, and given her
overall clinical status and prognosis it was decided not to
proceed in this regard.

ID: She developed a number of infections throughout her hospital
stay, including Klebsiella and fungal pneumonia as well as VRE
bacteremia on the week of [**6-14**].  She was treated with
antibiotics directed at these pathogens, and was followed
closely by the infectious disease service.

Overall, she failed to make significant clinical improvement and
her multi-system organ failure worsened.  Extensive discussions
were undertaken with her family, who expressed understanding of
her clinical status and decided not to continue heroic measures
to keep her alive.
