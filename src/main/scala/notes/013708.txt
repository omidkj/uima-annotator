irregular heart rhythm, which the patient notes feeling
palpitations. No record of atrial fibrillation has been
documented for him. He has had an echocardiogram which shows a
valve area of 1.3 cm2, and a gradient of 25 mm/Hg, giving him
moderate aortic stenosis with ++ aortic insufficiency. This has
caused diminished exercise capacity.

lungs are clear otherwise. The patient has prior AVR and median
sternotomy. There is no evidence for pneumothorax is identified.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17358**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-3-24**] and taken directly
to the operating room where he underwent an aortic valve
replacement utilizing a [**Street Address(2) 11688**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] regent valve.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical step down
unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 17358**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. Coumadin was started
for anticoagulation. He was then transferred to the cardiac
surgical step down unit for further recovery. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. As he was slow to anticoagulate on
coumadin, heparin was started as a bridge until his INR became
therapeutic. Amiodarone was started for frequent premature
ventricular and atrial contractions. Toradol was started for
relief of his sternal and shoulder pain. Mr. [**Known lastname 17358**] developed a
left lower lobe consolidation for which combivent, flovent and
levofloxacin were started. Zosyn was also started for better
coverage. Mr. [**Known lastname 17358**] was transfused 2 units of packed red blood
cells for postoperative anemia with good results. Mr. [**Known lastname 17358**]
continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day ten. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **],
his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an
outpatient.
