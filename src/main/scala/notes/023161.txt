Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive episode at rehab

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation.


History of Present Illness:
72 yo [**First Name3 (LF) 8003**]-speaking female with DM2, HTN, and prior CVAs was
admitted to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital on [**2159-12-24**] for seizures thought to
be [**2-9**] hypoglycemia and discharged to rehab on [**2160-1-4**] who
presented [**1-6**] with unresponsiveness and hypoxia.  She was
unresponsive at rehab on [**2160-1-5**]; oxygen sats were initially 99
on 2L, but then fell to 88% on 2L.  She was initially lethargic
but then became unresponsive, and was brought to ED by EMS.
.
On exam in the ED, she was unresponsive and leaning to the right
side.  She was hemodynamically stable with sats 100% on NRB.
She was intubated to protect her airway [**2-9**] mental status
changes.  Non-contrast head CT showed diffuse hypodensity in the
left frontal, parietal and temporal regions, likely from prior
CVA's. A hypodensity in the superior frontal region and also
suspicious region in the L basal ganglia were questionable acute
infarcts. However, after the neurology team reviewed the films
with the radiologist, it was thought that these areas could not
be definitively be labeled as new acute infarcts. A UA showed a
possible UTI and the pt received 500 mg IV levaquin. She was
then admitted to the MICU.
.
She was extubated on [**1-7**] without difficulties.  CTA of the
brain/neck showed subacute infarct in the inferior division of
the left middle cerebral artery, carotid arteries were patent.
EEG showed a slow background which may be seen in a mild
encephalopathy, or in the setting of extensive, bilateral or
deeper midline subcortical lesions. Stroke consult did not
believe pt had acute stroke as she also did not demonstrate any
focal neurologic defecits. She was however started on Keppra and
aggrenox for seizure and stroke prevention.
.
On transfer to the floor, patient denied any pain or SOB.  She
denied a fever.  When asked if anything is bothering her, she
said no.  She did not know where she was, thought the  year was
[**2072**], but was oriented to the city of [**Location (un) 86**].  Her family was
contact[**Name (NI) **] to inquire about her baseline mental status.

EKG: v-paced @ 65 bpm

IMAGING:
[**2160-1-5**] CT Head w/o Contrast:
1.  Diffuse hypodensity of the left hemisphere as described
which is
mostly chronic in nature. Underlying acute infarction of left
basal ganglia or the most superior portion of the frontal lobe
can not be excluded. MR of the head is recommended to assess for
an underlying acute infarction in the left hemisphere.
2.  No acute hemorrhage or shift of normal midline structure or
brain
herniation is noted.

[**2160-1-6**] EEG:
This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow
background. This may be seen in a mild encephalopathy, or in the

setting of extensive, bilateral or deeper midline subcortical
lesions.

[**2160-1-6**] CTA Head & Neck:
HEAD CT:  Hypodensity in the distribution of the left inferior
middle cerebral artery likely represents a subacute ischemic
event.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and
configuration.  There is no shift of normally midline
structures. HEAD AND NECK CTA:  The extracranial carotid and
vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent without
evidence of stenosis.  The distal cervical internal carotid
artery measures 4 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left. There is
a cutoff of the left MCA inferior division.  There is no
evidence of aneurysm formation. IMPRESSION:  Subacute infarct in
the inferior division of the left middle
cerebral artery.

[**2160-1-13**]:
Single portable radiograph of the chest is submitted. The left
costophrenic angle is excluded. Cardiomediastinal contour is
unchanged compared with [**2160-1-8**]. Assessment of the pulmonary
parenchyma is slightly limited by respiratory motion. No
right-sided effusion is detected. A right thoracic cardiac
pacemaker is unchanged. The right hilar contour is not well
assessed secondary to patient positioning. Left basilar
atelectasis persists.
IMPRESSION:
Limited exam.
Persistent left basilar atelectasis.

[**2160-1-14**]: TTE:
The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Prominent symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with low normal global systolic
function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Right
ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
In the absence of a prominent history of hypertension, an
infiltrative process should be considered for the underlying
etiology of the left ventricular hypertrophy.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old female with COPD, h/o left frontal CVA and h/o
hypoglycemic seizures admitted from rehab for unresponsiveness.

# MENTAL STATUS CHANGE: Patient was sdmitted from [**Hospital **]
Health Care for unresponsive episode.  In the ED, she was found
to be hypercarbic with Co2 at 81.  She was intubated for
hypercarbia and for airway protection.  In the MICU, she was
extubated as her hypercarbia improved and her Co2 was 52 on
nasal cannula.  Neurology consult was called for evaluation of
unresponsiveness.  Initially there was a concern for acute
stroke, but head CT and head CTA were negative.  There was also
a concern for seizure since she has had hx of admission to
[**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for hypoglycemic seizures.  However, EEG during
this admission was negative.  After discussion with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and the neurology team, it was decided that she will be on
Keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis.
