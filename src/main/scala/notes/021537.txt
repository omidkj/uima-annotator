Service:  CT [**Last Name (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 76 year old female with
known cardiac risk factors and a history of breast cancer had
worsening anginal chest pain with exertion over the past
couple of weeks prior to admission to cardiology service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  Hypercholesterolemia.
Breast cancer with right lumpectomy with radiation therapy 10
years ago.  Duodenal ulcer.  Back pain with negative bone
scan.  Known mitral regurgitation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 75 mg once a day, aspirin
81 mg once a day, Lipitor, cimetidine 30 mg twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin gave her hives.  Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatories gave her increased deafness.
Undetermined allergy to Lomotil.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the cardiology service
for workup of her chest pain.  Preoperative labs were as
follows.  White count was 7.1, hematocrit 39.7, platelet
count 235,000.  PT 13.2, PTT 23.0, INR 1.2.  Sodium 141, K
4.0, chloride 104, CO2 26, BUN 15, creatinine 0.9, blood
sugar 128.  CK and troponin were drawn on patient.
Ultimately troponin was positive.  Patient was referred for
cardiac catheterization to rule out myocardial infarction as
part of her workup.  Cath found 95% distal left main lesion
with minor disease in mid-LAD, no disease in circumflex, 100%
ostial occlusion of RCA.  Patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13624**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10102**] from cardiac surgery who saw her.  Patient
ultimately ruled in for myocardial infarction preoperatively.
Patient also had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed in the
cath lab.

On exam she had unremarkable HEENT.  No masses in her neck
and no carotid bruits.  Lungs had rales at the bases.  Heart
had muffled sounds with no murmur.  She had abdominal obesity
with no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities had no edema.
Neurologically she was oriented with gross function normal
and no obvious neuro deficits.

No ventriculogram was done on patient, but preoperative
transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
approximately 15% with 3+ mitral regurgitation.  TE in the
O.R. confirmed diagnosis of extremely poor ventricular
function and raised the question of mild AS.  Patient went to
the operating room on [**1-13**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**].
Additional preoperative work showed poor R wave progression
on preoperative EKG with T waves being flipped in 1, 5 and 6
and positive troponin.  On [**1-13**] patient underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting times two with LIMA to LAD
and vein graft to circumflex artery.  In the operating room
patient had a fair amount of difficulty separating from
cardiopulmonary bypass which was tried several times with
multiple attempts with drug support and inotropic support,
but patient had recalcitrant dysrhythmias.  Please refer to
the anesthesia death note in the operating room on [**1-13**].
Patient did not survive the operation.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 90778**]
operative note is on file.  Patient was pronounced in the
operating room at 15:48 on [**2108-1-13**].  Patient did not
survive the operation.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times two.
2.  Myocardial infarction.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Status post breast cancer with lumpectomy.
6.  Duodenal ulcer.
7.  Back pain.

Again, patient expired in the hospital on [**2108-1-13**].
