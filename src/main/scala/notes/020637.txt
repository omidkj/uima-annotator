Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for ERCP for concern for ascending cholangitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP x 2
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION

History of Present Illness:
85 yoF PMH HTN, PVD, reportedly benign tumor of the colon
removed [**2122**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital [**2124-3-16**] with
the acute onset of epigastric pain, [**9-27**], associated with
nausea and vomiting. In the OSH ER, the patient was hypertensive
with systolics in the 200s and HR 110-130. The patient had a
small amount of hematemesis. CT of the abdomen showed
gallbladder and intra- and extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation
consistent with cholecystitis and concerning for ascending
cholangitis. Cystic lesion at CBD, consistent with cholecocal
cyst. No gallstones visualized on CT or US.
.
Initial liver enzymes significant for AST 105 then 605 prior to
transfer, alkaline phosphatase 110 then 167, total bilirubin 6.7
with direct 4.5. Amylase 153 and lipase 139 prior to transfer.
2/2 blood culture bottles positive for GNR, ID/sensitivities
pending. The patient was started on flagyl and levofloxacin
[**3-16**]; it appears as if the levofloxacin was discontinued and
aztreonam started [**3-17**]. This may haven been changed secondary to
QTc prolongation but it is unclear.
.
The patient's initial WBC 10,000, which increased to 20,000
prior to transfer. Initial platelets were 212 but dropped to 124
prior to transfer. Initial creatinine 0.9, increasing to 1.5
prior to transfer.
.
The patient had a troponin leak prior to transfer, with initial
<0.1, then 0.26, then 0.28. EKG showed no ST or T wave changes
indicative of ischemia. The elevated troponin appears to have
occurred in the setting of ARF. The troponins were not sent with
OSH records and it is unclear if there was CK elevation.
.
On presentation, the patient complains of mild nausea. She
denies fevers, chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, melena/BRBPR.
She denies further emesis since presentation. She describes the
abdominal pain she experienced on presentation as epigastric and
then radiating to both upper quadrants. She denies chest pain,
SOB, dysuria but complains of some urinary frequency. Review of
systems otherwise negative in detail.

Pertinent Results:
[**2124-3-20**] ERCP: 1.The major papilla was located in the second part
of the duodenum with a choledocal cyst in the distal CBD.
2.The proximal PD visualised was normal
3.Cannulation of the CBD was very difficult due to the presence
of a large choledocal cyst.
4.Cannulation was achieved using straight, and angled glide
wires.
5.Even though deep cannulation was achieved,due to looping of
the wire within the choledocal cyst, stenting could not be
achieved.
6.Cholangiogram was suggestive of a slight distal CBD narrowing
which did not appear to be obstructive, however this will need
to be confirmed on a definitive repeat cholangiogram.
7.In order to allow drainage from the choledocal cyst, a small
needle knife fistulotomy was created into the choledocal cyst.
8.Obstructive bile was seen flowing from the cyst, which was
decompressed by the pre-cut.
.
[**2124-3-17**] CXR: Endotracheal tube tip is 2-1/2 cm above the carina.
There is right IJ line with tip in the right atrium. There is a
small left effusion. There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss
with right perihilar infiltrate that is slightly increased
compared to the prior study. There is no pneumothorax.
.
[**2124-3-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead voltage. Delayed
precordial R wave progression. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
[**2124-3-19**] CXR: 1. Improvement in perihilar opacity on the right
side.
2. Increase in bilateral pleural effusions and in the
retrocardiac density on the left side.
.
[**2124-3-20**] CT HEAD: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
[**2124-3-20**] KUB: No evidence of gross intra-abdominal free air.
.
[**2124-3-21**] CXR: 1. Improvement in perihilar opacity on the right
side.
2. Increase in bilateral pleural effusions and in the
retrocardiac density on the left side.
.
[**2124-3-21**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the
midventricular segment of the anterior septum and anterior free
wall, severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral
wall, and extensive apical akinesis extending into the
midventricular segment of the inferior and posterior walls. Only
tha basal posterior wall displays apparently normal contractile
function. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. There is severe hypokinesis
of the apical half of the free wall of the right ventricle.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. An aortic valve vegetation/mass cannot
be excluded. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic
valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2124-3-21**] C.CATH: Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by
percutaneous entry of the right femoral artery, using a 5 French
angled pigtail catheter, advanced to the left ventricle through
a 5 French introducing sheath. Coronary Angiography: was
performed in multiple projections using a 5 French JL4 and a 5
French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
.
[**2124-3-22**] CXR: Interval partial improvement in pulmonary edema.
Stable small bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac
opacity.
.
[**2124-3-25**] UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT: No evidence of left lower
extremity deep vein thrombosis.
.
[**2124-3-25**] CXR: Improvement in the appearance of the pulmonary edema
since the prior examination. Improvement in left lower lobe
atelectasis and/or airspace disease. Persistent bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right.
.
[**2124-3-27**] ERCP: 1. Evidence of a wide open duodenal-choledochol
cyst fistula
2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed via the
duodenal-choledochol cyst fistula
3. A narrowing was found just above the cystic dilation in the
lower third of the CBD.
4. Cytology samples were obtained using a brush in the lower
third of the common bile duct.
.
[**2124-3-23**] BEDSIDE SWALLOW: SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Pt is not demonstrating any s&s aspiration, nor any s&s
oropharyngeal dysphagia at bedside. The pt does appear to have
no
appetite at this time, which is likely affecting her desire to
eat/swallow food/liquid. Also spoke to RN who indicated pt may
benefit from enema as she has not had recent BM and t
