Final Report
HISTORY: 51-year-old male with left-sided PICC.
FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of the right-sided
PICC line and
interval placement of a left-sided PICC. The left-sided PICC tip
is in the
right atrium, approximately 4 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction.
Midline
sternotomy wires are intact. The mediastinal contours are
unchanged. The
heart is enlarged. There is no large pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Left PICC tip in right atrium, 4 cm
beyond cavoatrial junction. These findings were discussed with
[**Doctor First Name **], the IV nurse, at the time of dictation.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: secretions with fevers - r/o
infiltrate
Final Report:
There is geographic ground-glass opacity seen in the basal
segments of the
right lower lobe (4:129). Elsewhere, other than minimal
dependent
atelectasis, the lungs are clear, without further focal
consolidations. There is no cavitary lung lesion identified.
There is a small simple left pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.
There is a tracheostomy tube in standard position. The airways
are patent to the subsegmental level, without endobronchial
lesions or appreciable
endobronchial secretions.
There is a right-sided PICC, which terminates in the superior
vena cava.
Postoperative changes in the mediastinum following CABG are
noted. Median
sternotomy wires appear intact. There are numerous surgical
clips. There is no pericardial effusion. The aorta is normal in
caliber and configuration.
The main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber. Scattered
prominent
mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, possibly reactive.
 In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, there is no
acute abnormality identified. There is no adrenal nodule or
mass. There are no contour altering hepatic or renal masses in
the visualized portion of the liver and kidneys.
BONE WINDOWS:
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Minimal height
loss is noted at multiple mid thoracic vertebral bodies, of
uncertain
chronicity. No acute fracture lines are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Focal ground-glass opacities in the right lower lobe. While
this may
reflect infectious or inflammatory etiologies, including
possible aspiration, the isolated nature and clinical history
favors pneumonia.
2. Small left pleural effusion.
3. Expected postoperative changes status post CABG, without
pericardial
effusion, mediastinal hematoma, or other evidence of
complication.
4. Prominent mediastinal nodes, likely reactive.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  <= 25%  >= 55%
Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Dilated LV cavity.
Severely depressed LVEF.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Conclusions
Suboptimal technical quality due to poor apical and subcostal
images.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated with severe systolic dysfunction.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is a
small pericardial effusion inferolateral to the left ventricle
without evidence of hemodynami
