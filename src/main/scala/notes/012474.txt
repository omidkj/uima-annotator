Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
77 yo female transferred from OSH for further eval of
respiratory failure. The patient was admitted to OSH on [**4-18**]
with acute shortness of breath. She was found to have RLL PNA on
CXR and intubated in the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Her initial ABG on AC FiO2 1.0 was 7.19/80/405. She was treated
empirically with ceftriazone, azithromycin for CAP and
Solumedrol for COPD exacerbation. Initial ECG was notable for
TWI throughout the precordium and CK and troponin peaked on HD 2
at 205, 1.21. An echo was notable for EF 65% with concentric
LVH. The patient was (+) 4.5 L, F/U CXR were suggestive of b/l
effusions and her BNP peaked at 3120 so she was diuresed with
lasix 40 PO bid. Sputum cx notable for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans so
fluconazole was started on [**4-23**]. On AC, her hypoxia and
hypercarbia improved but she was difficult to wean [**12-23**] to
decreased mental status despite a negative head CT. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with "anoxic brain injury" and attempts to
wean.

** CXR:
Findings suggest probable failure with bilateral effusions and
post-surgical changes in the left hemithorax. Underlying
pneumonia cannot be excluded at the left base.
.
** ECHO:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function
appears depressed. Overall left ventricular systolic function
cannot be reliably assessed. Distal septal hypokinesis is
present.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
.
[**Hospital 40963**] HOSPITAL COURSE
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the pt was sedated on propofol.  She was
weaned off the propofol and began to wake up.  She completed her
course of antibiotics for a ? of LLL pneumonia.  There was a
question of whether an acute MI caused the patient's respiratory
failure on the day of her presentation to the outside hospital.
Her cardiac enzymes were followed and they trended down.  A
heparin drip was not started as it was thought that the pt was
outside the appropriate window.  The patient improved
dramatically on antibiotics and a steroid taper and she was
extubated ten days after she was intubated.  The patient's BP
was difficult to control once the propofol was weaned off and
she was restarted on all of her home medications and titrated up
to keep SBP < 140.  On HD #11, she was doing well on nasal
cannula and transferred to the floor.
.
At midnight on HD #12, patient was noted to go into acute
respiratory distress.  She had very poor air movement and was
hypoxic to 83%.  She was not thought to be wet at that time.
She was started on continuous nebs, 100% face mask, given Lasix
40 IV with good output (although she had been 1L neg for the
day), and given a dose of morphine.  She initially was asking
for re-intubation but was able to settle out and her O2 sats
returned to the 90s.  CXR obtained and looked unchanged.  EKG
with persistent Q waves in lateral leads and continued poor R
wave progression.  No new changes. ABG was 7.23/81/142.
.
Cardiology was consulted and looked at prior EKGs.  Of note
patient had a recent normal P MIBI, but this may be a false
negative if patient has L Main disease.  Cardiology recommended
cycling enzymes and placing on nitro gtt.
.
The patient was then transferred back to the floor with a plan
to have a pMIBI for rule out ischemia.  MIBI was performed the
following day, and was found to be negative for perfusion
defects.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF ISSUES ADDRESSED DURING THIS ADMISSION
.
1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Patient was treated for LLL PNA and
COPD exacerbation at OSH. She completed 10 day course of
ceftriaxone on [**4-28**] and received a course of azithro at the OSH.
She was continued on nebs and NC Oxygen throughout her
admission.  Diuresis was continued with lasix 20 mg PO daily.
.
2. NSTEMI/Troponin @ OSH - Troponin here has been < 0.10.  The
patient had slight EKG changes during acute hypoxia this
hospitalization (pseudonormalization of T waves in V4-6), and
positive troponin leak (but always < 0.1).  EKG is now unchanged
from previous and stress MIBI done was negative for ischemia.
She was continued on a betablocker, aspirin, ACE, and statin.
.
3. COPD - She was eventually changed to her outpatient regimen
of Combivent, Fluticasone, and Salmeterol inhalers.  She was
also continued on a slow steroid taper at the time of discharge.

.
4. ALTERED MS: The patient was transiently confused during this
admission.  Now this has completely resolved.   The etiology was
thought to be secondary to sedating medications and narcotics.
These medications should be avoided in the future.
.
5. DIABETES - She was continued on fixed dose of NPH with an
insulin sliding scale. Her metformin was held.  The NPH dose was
titrated up to 36 units QAM, and 32 units QPM.  This increased
requirement is likely due to steroid treatment and should be
titrated down when appropriate.
.
8. ANEMIA - The patient was anemic on this admission.  Iron
studies, B12, and folate were all within normal limits.  There
were no active signs of bleeding.  Her baseline hematocrit is
unknown.   She may need EGD/colonoscopy as an outpatient for
work up of anemia.
.
9. RIGHT UPPER EXT EDEMA: A RUE ultrasound was done which did
not show evidence of DVT.  Likely due to infiltrated IV.  Now
completely resolved.
.
10. CONCERN FOR HIT: The patient had a slight drop in her
platelets on this admission.  Since HIT was suspected, heparin
was discontinued and a HIT antibody was sent.  This HIT ab came
back negative.
