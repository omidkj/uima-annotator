Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 54 year old Cantonese-speaking male with DM and ESRD
on HD, and CAD s/p CABG, difficult to control HTN, who had a 3
week hospital course for MSSA septicemia from an infected
hemodialysis catheter, aspiration pneumonia, unstable
angina/demand ischemia with new ST depressions on EKG, and
co-management of other chronic medical issues.

MSSA septicemia from infected HD catheter -
54 year old Cantonese-only speaking male with CAD, HTN, DM and
ESRD on HD presented with fever and chills [**2188-10-1**]. He was found
to have a MSSA RIJ HD catheter infection by cultures on [**10-1**] and
[**10-2**]. He was given Vanc/Gent in the ED. The catheter was removed
and he had a temporary line placed. He was treated for the
infection with vancomycin, dosed with HD, per the renal
attending. The patient had a tunnelled HD catheter placed on
[**2188-10-9**] after dialysis. The patient was continued on vancomycin
on the floor, day# 1= [**2188-10-1**] to finish a 3-week course of
antibiotics the day of discharge. Daily vancomycin levels were
checked and he was dosed at HD ([**Month/Day/Year 766**], Wednesday, Friday) to
keep the vancomycin greater than 15. The patient was kept on
vancomycin for MSSA because the patient did not have good IV
access until an emergent midline was placed on [**2188-10-17**] at which
time the patient needed vancomycin coverage for
aspiration/nosocomial pneumonia. So, throughout the hospital
course, the patient was kept on vancomycin for MSSA instead of
switching to nafcillin. All surveillance blood cultures showed
no growth. The new tunnelled catheter had bleeding around the
site during the 24 hours that the patient was receiving heparin
gtt for possible NSTEMI with new ST depressions. Since then, the
catheter has had some oozing from the site when accessed by
hemodialysis during his sessions but has been controlled with
pressure at the site.

A CT scan of the chest revealed a RIJ thrombus around the site
of the new tunnelled catheter. Per the renal team, there was no
indication to change the catheter and patient will need to have
a follow-up CT scan of his chest in [**3-8**] months to assess this
clot.

Initially, he also complained of back pain in the setting of the
bacteremia and had an MRI and RUQ ultrasound to eval for other
possible source of septicemia, which were negative.  The patient
also had a TTE that showed a possible pulmonary valve vegetation
on [**2188-10-14**] but a TEE done 6 days later on [**2188-10-20**] showed no
endocarditis.

The patient was discharged after finishing a 3 week course of
vancomycin per ID team recommendations, at hemodialysis for
septicemia fr
