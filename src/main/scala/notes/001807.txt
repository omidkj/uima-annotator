Chief Complaint:
Dehydration, Acute Renal Failure, Severe Hypernatremia,
Hypokalemia

PEG placement
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with moderate-severe dementia, recent very
complicated hospital course from [**Date range (1) 98904**], during which
time she was intubated [**Date range (2) 98905**], with aspiration
pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and tension
pneumothorax (from line-placement), septic shock requiring
pressors, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. Pt now
presents to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern for failure to thrive with
refusing all po intake with sodium i nthe high 160's.

Per [**Hospital1 1501**] records, the patient had been refusing po intake for
several days. Her daughter called [**Name (NI) 1501**] and told them that she
wanted the patient to be brought to the hospital for admission.
In the ED, patient received NS @ 125 cc/hr, IV KCl 40 meq.
Patient is demented and is unable to provide history.

On arrival to the floor, the patient had a calculated 5L free
water deficit along with dehydration. This was attempted to be
corrected on the floor, however her sodium was rechecked and was
175, so she was moved to the ICU for further therapy. In the
ICU, her sodium was slowly corrected with renal consultation, to
the low 150's, and she was transferred back to the floor.

Serial sodium levels were checked, with plan for slow resolution
at a rate of [**3-16**] per day. As the patient still is taking low PO,
split fluids were started with both NS and D5W drips to allow
seperate titration.

Past Medical History:
# moderate to severe dementia
# Osteoporosis
# Chronic Diastolic Heart failure
# mild-moderate systolic pulmonary hypertension
# history of depression
# Malnutrition - moderate to severe, likely secondary to
dementia

Hospitalization [**1-18**]:
# Hx Respiratory Failure attributed to aspiration pneumonia
necessitating artificial ventilation, vasopressors, and broad
spectrum antibiotics. Septic Shock with thrombocytopenia
possibly related to consumption.
# Left Lower Lobe collapse/partial collapse s/p bronchoscopy
# Tension Pneumothorax on Right s/p central line insertion, s/p

chest tube placement for nearly 2 weeks. Significant
subcutaneous emphysema, resolving
# Ventilator associated pneumonia - MRSA and pan-sensitive
Klebsiella pneumonia cultured from sputum
# Acute renal failure - resolved
# Hx Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, on
amiodarone since [**2105-12-12**]

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with severe dementia with poor functional
status, multiple medical problems with multiple recent
hospitalizations including recent ICU stay with intubation,
sepsis, pressors, etc, now presented with severe dehydration,
poor po intake, hypernatremia, and failure to thrive.

#. Severe Hypernatremia, Dehydration, Acute Renal Failure,
Failure to thrive: The pt was admitted with a sodium up to 175
on admission. She was treated with D5W and then D5W plus NS
until sodium normalized. She was followed by renal while she was
here. Creatinine was also up to 0.9 from 0.5 on admission, which
also resolved after IV fluids. Per OMR, the pts HCP [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 1445**] has had a number of discussions with prior hospitalists
including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding feeding tube
placement. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 98906**] of gerontology was consulted to see this
patient, and in his discussion with pts HCP, it was decided that
although feeding tube placement would not prevent aspiration, it
would prevent recurrent admissions for dehydration. The
hospitalist caring for the pt also discussed plan with pts HCP,
who did wish to pursue feeding tube placement. She  understood
the risk of continued or increased aspiration and lack of
prolonging life. It was also decided to continue to allow pt to
eat as HCP feels joy of eating is very important to pt, even at
risk for recurrent aspiration PNA. Prior to feeding tube
placement, PPN was initiated. Surgery was consulted initially
but wanted to place a J tube under general anesthesia. Case was
discussed with GI and IR, and decision was made to place PEG b
