History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70 yo man with ho DM2, HTN, and recent
diagnoses of AFib who was transferred from OSH on [**2107-1-10**] for
evaluation of pericardial effusion. Around [**2106-12-17**], pt had
CHF-like symptoms, and he was started on diuretics. Four days
prior to admission patient had  new onset Atrial flutter and was
started on Coumadin. On [**12-27**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 3325**] for a worsening dyspnea over  4 weeks. He was intubated
in the ED and transferred to the CCU, where he was started on a
Dilt gtt and was eventually extubated on [**1-6**]. Then pt had AMS,
thought to be metabolic and had a CT-chest showing  a large
pericardial effusion and bilateral upper lobe and RML air space
disease. He started Imipenem and continued Levofloxacin. TTE at
that time showed LVEF of 25%. He underwent a TEE with attempt to
cardiovert, but he was found to have an atrial thrombus, so this
was not attempted. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care
and possible pericardiocentesis since effusion appears to
progress. At OSH he also had ARF, hematuria, and anemia (hct
24).
.
On transfer his echo showed tamponade changes and he was
transfered to the CCU for pericardial drainage. Repeat echo [**1-13**]
showed no reaccumulation of fluid. Due to his garbled speech and
dysphagia, neurology was consulted and felt he had a left
parietal cardioembolic stroke (h/o A. fib). After failing S&S
eval, decision has been made to pursue PEG after transfer to the
floor. He was also found to have a pneumonia, so is being
treated with Zosyn. On the floor he has had more agitation and
has been given haldol 1mg and zyprexa 5mg. Then pt became more
somulent and a ABG showed 7.19/92/56 on a shovel mask with 2
liters. HR was in the 80s and BP in 120s. He was transfered to
MICU for airway concern and hypercabic resp failure.
.
On arrival to the MICU he was unresponsive. He did not tolerate
placement of a BIPAP, so was intubated. On intubation he was
noted to have a large amount of material in the thorat, possible
food. He had some transient runs of bradycarida that quickly
recovered to 90s without intervention.
.
Review of Systems: Unable to obtain due to solmulence and
intubation.

STUDIES:
.
PERICARDIAL FLUID:
 NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
 Lymphocytes, monocytes, and mesothelial cells.
.
RHCath and Pericardiocentesis:
1. Right heart catheterization prior to pericardiocensis showed
elevation and equalization of diastolic filling pressures
(20-22mmHg) that were similar to the opening pericardial
pressure (19mmHg).  Pulsus paradoxus recorded via the a-line
tracing was approximately 20mmHg.
2. Pericardiocentesis was performed with needle entry from the
subxiphoid position.  The opening pericardial pressure was 19
mmHg.
3. Subsequent to removal of 920 cc of blood fluid (all sent for
studies) and confirmation by echocardiography of complete fluid
removal, the pericardial pressure decreased to -2 to 1 mmHg and
RA pressure decreased to 15 mmHg.
4. Anesthesia was present during the case to manage the
patient's airway given his tenuous respiratory status.  He was
maintained on 100% oxygen therapy.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pericardial tamponade with improvement in hemodynamics after
removal of 920 cc of bloody fluid.
2. Pericardial drain in place.
.
CT HEAD [**1-11**]:
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect,
or infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, most
compatible with atrophic change. Note is made of bilateral
atherosclerotic calcification within the carotid siphons. The
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are well aerated.
.
ECHO [**1-11**] #1:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a large pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. There is right ventricular diastolic compression,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

IMPRESSION: Large pericardial effusion with echo evidence of
impaired filling/tamponade physiology.
.
ECHO [**1-11**] #2:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
RV with borderline normal free wall function. There is no
residual pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-11**],
pericardial effusion (post tap) has resolved. There is no longer
evidence of RV compression.
.
ECHO [**1-13**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level
