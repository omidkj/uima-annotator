Pertinent Results:

Micro: blood cx- pending
.
Imaging studies:
CXR: IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis.
Superimposed pneumonia difficult to rule out.
.
PMIBI [**2189-7-20**]:IMPRESSION: Considerable soft tissue attenuation
hampers interpretation. Mild fixed inferior wall defect; the
inferior reversibility is less apparent compared to [**2186-12-5**].
Moderate, partially reversible defect in the mid and distal
anterior walls and a severe fixed apical defect. Akinetic distal
anterior and apical walls, with calculated left ventricular
ejection fraction of 39%.

Brief Hospital Course:
With regard of her dyspnea the patient had an elevated BNP and
imaging findings concerning for flash pulmonary edema, likely in
the context of hypertension. Given her respiratory distress she
was admitted to the ICU where she was observed over night.  She
was given Lasix for diuresis with substantial improvement in
respiratory function and decreased oxygen requirement. She was
continued on her home fluticasone/salmeterol with additional
albuterol/ipratropium.  She was called out to the floor where
her respiratory status remained stabled and returned back to
baseline upon discharge.

with regard to her other medical problems:

# Acute renal failure: Thought to be due to a combination of
prerenal failure from overdiuresis as well as ACE-I use. She was
given minimal amount of volume back, and ACE-I was held. He
renal function improved back to baseline upon discharge.

# DM1: The patient was continued on her home regimen of Lantus
with regular insulin sliding scale.  She did not have any
evidence of DKA on her laboratory values.

# Nausea: Her nausea was likely due to gastroparesis in the
setting of hyperglycemia.  She was continued on antiemetics for
support and put back on her oral regimens once she improved.

# Hypertension:  The patient continued on her metoprolol 50 mg
PO tid and losartan  25 daily.

# Coronary artery disease: Continued ASA 325, beta blocker,
cardiac diet.

# Chronic migraine HA: Continue gabapentin and Vicodin per
outpatient regimen.

# Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
