Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1850**]
Chief Complaint:
hematocrit drop and melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy
EGD / Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
83 yo male w/hx of CAD s/p recent PTCA, CHF (EF30-35%), PVD s/p
CEA and AAA repair, prostate CA s/p radiation tx, afib off
coumadin admitted for falling hematocrit and melena. Pt was
recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 58978**] for GIB which was managed
conservatively since EGD at OSH was neg and colonoscopy revealed
only nonbleeding polyps and tics. During that hospitalization he
had elevated troponins so he was taken to catherizationa and his
RCA and L circumflex arteries were stented with plan for one
month of plavix. Plan was made for follow-up with general
surgery for a large sessile polyp in the ascending colon which
could not be removed with colonocopy and was thought to be
contributing to his bleeding. During follow up appointments with
his PCP on [**2-25**] and ?[**3-4**] he was transfused 1 unit PRBC's on
each of those days for low Hct. Pt was seen on day of admission
by a General Surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19122**] who felt the pt looked pale and
referred him to the ED. He reported generalized weakness and
mild DOE but otherwise was feeling well. In the ED his vital
signs were stable although his Hct remained stable despite 1
unit PRBC transfusion so he was transfused a second unit and he
was admitted.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
1. Interval development of a small amount of fluid in the left
paracolic gutter, surrounding the spleen and liver, and adjacent
to some loops of small bowel in the left abdomen and adjacent to
the hepatic flexure. There is no abnormality of the adjacent
bowel that is identified. No free air or spillage of contrast is
detected. The findings may correlate non-specifically with
recent colonoscopy. The visualized main proximal portions of the
aortic branches are patent.
2. Slight gallbladder wall thickening and non-specific stranding
about the gallbladder and pancreas.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2174-3-13**] 10:43 AM
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. However,
other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease
including fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
2. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
3. Slight gallbladder wall thickening, but no wall edema or
gallbladder distention. Slight wall thickening could be seen in
an edematous state. If there is strong suspicion of
cholecystitis, biliary scintigraphy could be helpful.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-3-12**] 7:25 AM
There is cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the aorta and slight
pulmonary, vascular engorgement, possibly related to CHF or
fluid overload. There is flattening of the diaphragms consistent
with COPD.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo male w/hx of CAD s/p recent PTCA, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD s/p
CEA and AAA repair, prostate CA s/p radiation tx, afib- off
coumadin admitted [**3-9**] for falling hematocrit and melena.

GI Bleed and Abdominal Pain:
Patient recently admitted and had negative EGD with colonoscopy
showing only polyps none of which were bleeding. Pt has also
known diverticuli although they were also not bleeding on recent
scope. Small bowel has never been evaluated since recent CT was
without oral contrast and no SBFT performed. Given hx of melena
with no BRBPR despite 2 unit Hct drop over the last month,
elevated BUN, we were more suspicious of UGI source although EGD
neg. Pt was evaluated by surgery in the ED and feel that polyps
aren't a likely source of the bleeding and consider the patient
a high surgical risk.  Patient underwent colonoscopy, and
multiple polys were removed without complication.  However, one
day following colonoscopy, patient became hypotensive and
ill-appearing with mild abdominal pain and was transferred to
the intensive care unit for closer monitoring for concern of
micro-perforation vs. bleed.  Of note, CT abdomen/pelvis
revealed no free air, however did reveal pericolic fluid of
unknown significance as well as some mild gallbladder wall
thickening and fat stranding of also unknown significance.
Patient underwent surgical evaluation with concern for
cholecystitis vs. bowel microperforation.

Atrial Fibrillation:
Patient was in stable atrial fibrillation throughout hospital
course until the evening following transfer to intensive care
unit.  Patient became acutely tachycardic to 140s-150s, with SBP
90s-100s, and was thought to be in atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response secondary to adrenergic stress from
infection vs. blood loss.  Patient was initially bolused with
~2liters of lactated Ringer's, however, heart rate did not
improve, although pressure improv
