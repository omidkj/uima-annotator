Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.[**Known lastname 50416**] is a 59 year-old gentleman w/ DM2 who presented w/
malaise and hypoxia.

1. Hypoxia, hypercarbia: Initial ABG 7.38/49/200 on
nonrebreather.  Patient was immediately weaned to 5L NC in the
MICU with O2 Sats 88-92%.  Although mental status was initially
excellent, after ~5 hours in MICU patient suddenly became
obtunded and was not arousable to sternal rub.  O2 Sats remained
~90%.  ABG showed 7.29/66/44.  Actue hypercarbia was likely
secondary to a combination of baseline COPD and severe upper
airway obstruction in the setting of a large tongue and oral
soft tissues as well as poor posture.  Patient likely
additionally has both obstructive sleep apnea and/or
obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.  BiPap was used intermittently
with improvement in mental status and ventilation.  On transfer
to the floor, pt was satting in mid 90's on room air and using
BiPAP at night. Mr. [**Known lastname 50416**] was treated empirically for COPD
exacerbation including standing nebulizers, azithromycin for a
5-day course, and prednisone 60 mg taper.  Sleep consult was
obtained to organize home nocturnal CPAP vs bipap. Prior to
discharge, follow-up was made with pulmonary (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4507**],
pulmonary function lab for PFTs and sleep [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
outpatient sleep studies. He will have home BiPAP arranged by
sleep clinic.

2. Nausea and vomitting: This may have been secondary to viral
illness or generalized malaise secondary to intermittent
hypercarbia at home. None since arrival. UA was not consistent
with a urinary tract infection as the etiology.

3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine 2.1 on
admission, from 1.2 when last checked ~14 months ago. Creatinine
rose after 2L fluid challenge.  Urine lytes were not consistent
with pre-renal etiology.  This was thought to be most likely
secondary to ATN in the setting of hypoension at home from
nausea and vomitting.  He continued to make 30 cc/h urine.
Renal ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Creatinine continued to improve during hospital course as it
dropped to 1.5 the day before discharge.

4. Chronic pain: Methadone and gabapentin were recently
increased by pt's PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] were held in the setting of
altered mental status as well as acute renal failure initially.
On transfer to general medical wards, pain medication was
restarted as creatinine improved from 2.1 on admission to 1.5.
Pt was restarted on outpatient regimen of 90mg.

5. Poor self-care:  Patient reported that his girlfriend /
visiting nurse take care of him.  However, on admission he
smelled bad and was covered in several layers of dirt. He also
had multiple cigarette burns and cuts on his arms, likely
indicative of attempts at self harm.  He denied suicidality on
admisison.  He is likely depressed and he will need psychiatric
follow-up.

# Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Novolin and humalog SS were
continued per home regimen. He was discharged on home dose of
70/30 40 units in the AM and 20 in PM.  He has close PCP follow
up on [**3-27**] and will have Electrolytes, BUN and Cr labs
drawn by VNA on [**3-24**] and these will be faxed to his PCP's
office.

On admission, patient stated his desire to be DNR/DNI.  He
further ellaborated that he would want no invasive lines or
procedures including arterial lines or central venous lines.
This was documented in the ICU consent in his chart.
