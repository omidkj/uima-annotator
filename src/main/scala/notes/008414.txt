History of Present Illness:
patient intubated and sedated. History taken from family and
from ED notes.
.
72 yo M with PMH of CRI (baseline Cr 3), AVR '[**74**] with 3 vessel
CABG, CVA with residual left eye vision deficit, s/p CEA [**10-16**],
HSP in '[**74**] who presents with SOB. Per ED notes, he was
complaining of midline abdominal pain along with DOE and SSCP.
Lying flat made his CP worse. He denied cough, fevers. He did
report decreased energy and appetitite, and also had some
abdominal cramping. His wife says he did not have BRBPR or tarry
stools (he does have dark stools but he take iron supplements).
No new headaches, changes in vision.
.
In the ED, his initial vital signs were T 96.3, BP 93/45, HR 60,
RR 24, O2sat 93% RA. 2 units of PRBC were ordered. He was
initially given [**Year (2 digits) **] 325mg and lasix 20mg IV. He was also given
levofloxacin but this infusion was stopped given hives and
itching. He was given benadryl. His BP dropped to 65/80. He was
on non-invasive ventilation and it was decided that he needed to
be intubated instead. He was given etomidate and
succinylcholine. He was then given morphine and versed for
sedation. He was then given D50, insulin, calcium gluconate for
hyperkalemia. His BP required pressor support and he was started
on dopamine gtt. He was taken for a CT abdomen without contrast
to assess for AAA. A RIJ was placed. He was given flagyl 500mg
IV.


Past Medical History:
-CVA s/p left visual changes
-CABG with 3 vessel disease: in [**2174**]. (LIMA - LAD, SVG to ramus
intermedius, SVG to large posterolateral branch of RCA)
-AVR '[**74**] on coumadin: History of rhemuatic heart disease/aortic
stenosis; with St. Jude's valve.
-HSP in '[**74**]; after CABG unclear cause
-chronic kidney disease stage IV from focal sclerosis
-XRT for skin cancer right ear
-gout
-hyperlipidemia
-History of colonic polyps, status post polypectomy. Repeat
colonoscopy [**9-13**] showed 2 small polyps that were not removed as
coumadin had not been held. Recommended to return in 3 years for
polypectomy.

lives with wife. has 4 sons. Quit tobacco in [**2174**], rare alcohol
use.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG 3vd, CRI, AVR, CVA who presents
with acute anemia, acute on chronic renal insuffiency, and
respiratory distress in the setting of elevated INR.
.
# Respiratory distress: Patient was intubated on arrival to the
MICU for respiratory distress in the ED thought to be related to
fluid overload intially but cardiogenic causes could not be
ruled out given his history of CAD s/p bypass and AV replacement
and MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] also seemed to have a LLL infiltrate which could
represent pneumonia. He was treated for azithromycin and
ceftriaxone for a presumed pneumonia.  He initally did well with
diuresing and was extubated. He did not tolerate this and
required reintubation within the 24-48hr after extubation.  He
then had some vomiting and devloped RLL consolidation which
could be aspiration vs unilateral CHF in the setting of cardiac
strain with elevated troponins (see below).  He was started on
CVVH to help remove fluid. He was continued on inhalers for this
COPD treatment.
.
# acute on chronic renal failure: Cr baseline is 3. Cr peaked at
6.1 during admission and came down on CVVH to the 2.4 range.
Volume status was improving on CVVH with renal consult
following.  He was still making urine as well.
.
# anemia: Had an elevated INR of 6.6 on presentation. HCT the
month prior to admission was around 30 and he presented with HCT
of 20.6. Given the rapid nature of the drop, he most likely had
a bleed although no obvious source. It was thought that he had
oozing from the colon and maybe the lung as well. He was given
PRBCs. An EGD was normal with no signs of bleeding.  He
developed a troponin leak in the setting of his anemia. He was
continued on heparin gtt given his mechanical aortic valve (was
on coumadin prior to admission).
.
# hypotension: Resolved; weaned off pressors in last 24 hours.
Thought due to volume status, as with CVVH his pressure
rebounded. He then began to have hypotension with no obvious
cause. ? septic shock with elevated WBC but no fever.  Started
empiric antibiotics.
.
# CAD s/p CABG: mild NSTEMI in setting of tachycardia and
possible hypovolemia and anemia. Patient currently on heparin
gtt for mechanical valve
- cont [**Last Name (LF) 30474**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], lipitor 80mg given recent NSTEMI
- no signs of ischemia on EKG
.
# AVR: on coumadin.
- Restarted hep gtt while in ICU given mechanical valve
- coumadin once stabilized
.
# gout: restarted allopurinol at renal dosing
.
# FEN: Tube feeds
# Access: RIJ placed on [**10-7**] in ED; R aline placed on [**10-7**];
2PIV

On [**2187-10-15**] at 6:30PM, Patient passed away. During family meeting
at 4PM earlier that day, family had decided to make patient CMO
given that he would not have wished to become dialysis dependent
and vent dependent. He was extubated and made comfortable and
passed shortly thereafter. Family at bedside.
