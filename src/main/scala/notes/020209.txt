CXRAY ON [**2127-5-6**]:
FINDINGS: Single view of the chest was compared to multiple
prior radiographs, the most recent dated [**2125-11-9**] and
CT chest dated [**2125-4-24**].  There are bibasilar opacities
consistent with bilateral lower lung pneumonia.  There is also
subtle opacity in the right upper lung. No pleural effusions or
pneumothoraces are identified. The surrounding soft tissue and
osseous structures appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Multilobar pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old woman with undiagnosed connective tissue disorder
(cyclic neutropenia, hypocomplementemia, necrobiosis lipoidica,
Raynaud phenomenon, MGUS, SICCA, etc) who presented with
multifocal pneumonia and sepsis/septic shock. She presented with
cough, hypoxia, episode of diarrhea, and hypotension. She slowly
improved with broad spectrum antibiotics for health care
associated pneumonia including empiric coverage for
pneumocystis. Induced sputa could not be obtained, so serum
galactomannan and Beta D Glucan assays were ordered.
Beta-d-glucan was negative and galactomannan was borderline
(0.5). Antibiotics were stopped after 7 days of therapy for
bacterial infections, and Bactrim was decreased to prophylactic
dosing. She had good oxygen saturations on room air for several
days prior to discharge. She developed a DVT at the site of her
PICC and superficial thrombosis. Enoxaparin was started and a
CTA was negative for PE. She was discharged on Lovenox for an
anticipated one month course of treatment. She was not bridged
to Coumadin because of inconsistent PO intake and concern that
her INR's would fluctuate widely. Her chronic LLE wound appeared
stable and without infection, and wound care was continued. Her
narcotics were initially decreased significantly given
somnolence and severe constipation. Her MS Contin was then
increased from 15 mg to 30 mg prior to discharge, and she was
instructed to follow-up with her PCP for further upward
titration as needed. She shou
