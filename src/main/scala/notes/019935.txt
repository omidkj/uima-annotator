Admission Date:  [**2188-12-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2188-12-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2117-12-9**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
woman with a history of CAD, status post CABG in [**2158**] (SVG
to LAD, cardiac catheterization in [**2175**] with occluded graft,
and 60% occluded RCA), chronic atrial fibrillation, mitral
valve replacement, and diabetes mellitus admitted to
[**Hospital 47**] Hospital on [**2188-12-11**] with acute onset of
chills, cough, and myalgias.  She was febrile at that time
with an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air.  Initial chest
x-ray at [**Location (un) 47**] revealed evidence of a left lower lobe
infiltrate and she received Zithromax in the Emergency Room
which was then changed to Levaquin in the CCU.  She denied
chest pain or neck pain and diaphoresis on admission.  Her
sputum culture reportedly grew out Streptococcus pneumoniae,
and she was reportedly ruled out for Influenzae A.

Her hospital course at [**Location (un) 47**] was complicated by a non ST
elevation MI with a peak CK at 298 on [**2188-12-12**].  Her course
was also complicated by episodes of hematuria, Guaiac
positive stool, and episodes of hemoptysis all on
anticoagulation.  She had a BNP on admission to [**Location (un) 47**] of
136 and was felt to not clinically be in heart failure.  She
had an echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of
50-60% without focal wall motion abnormality.

Every night, from [**2188-12-11**] to [**2188-12-18**], she
complained of increasing shortness of breath, cough, and
orthopnea.  At this time, she had no change in her oxygen
requirement which had continually been at 40% face mask
throughout her admission at [**Location (un) 47**].  She reported that
she had intermittent angina manifested as left neck and chest
pain throughout her stay at [**Location (un) 47**] which was relieved
only with IV nitroglycerin.  She denied any change in this
pain prior to [**2188-12-18**].

She was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**]
on [**2188-12-18**] for cardiac catheterization in the setting
of a non ST-elevation MI and a clinical picture possibly
consistent with congestive heart failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mechanical mitral valve replacement.
2.  History of CAD with coronary artery bypass grafting in
[**2158**] with an SVG to the LAD.
3.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
4.  CVA in [**2178**].
5.  Diabetes mellitus.
6.  History of pulmonary embolus in [**2149**].
7.  History of pneumonia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband.  She
denied any current tobacco, alcohol, or other drug use.  She
says that she quit smoking 30 years ago.  She reports minimal
exercise, however, is never restricted in her activities of
daily living.

FAMILY HISTORY:   There is no family history of coronary
disease, hypertension, or diabetes.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 100 mEq q.d.
2.  Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
3.  Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
4.  Aldactone 50 mg q.d.
5.  Glyburide 6 mg q.d.
6.  Lipitor 80 mg q.d.
7.  Allopurinol 300 mg q.d.
8.  Isosorbide 30 mg b.i.d.
9.  Lasix 80 mg q.d.
10. Coumadin 5 mg q.d.
11. Aspirin 81 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  She has an allergy to vancomycin which causes
anaphylaxis.  She also has an allergy to clindamycin and
gentamicin, both of which reportedly caused anaphylaxis.  She
has an allergy to penicillin which causes a rash.  She also
has an allergy to cefotaxime with an unknown reaction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
99.0, blood pressure 122/49, heart rate 70, respiratory rate
25, oxygen saturation of 96% on 40% face mask.  General:  She
appeared somewhat uncomfortable and was speaking in choppy
sentences.  She was alert and oriented times three.  There
was no evidence of accessory muscle use.  HEENT:  The pupils
were equally round and reactive to light. The extraocular
muscles were intact.  The oropharynx revealed moist mucous
membranes.  There were no lesions or exudates.  Lungs:  She
had a poor effort; however, she had decreased breath sounds
at the bases bilaterally and bibasilar crackles.  No wheezes
were appreciated.  Heart:  Irregular, with a normal S1 and
S2.  There was a mechanical click of her mitral valve.  She
had no appreciable gallops.  She had a II/VI systolic murmur
heard at the apex with radiation to the axilla.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended, and she had good bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Warm and without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
She had 2+ palpable pulses peripherally.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  CBC with a white count of 10,
hematocrit 35.7, platelets 222,000.  She had a sodium of 136,
potassium 3.8, chloride 99, bicarbonate 29, BUN 15,
creatinine 0.7.  She had a BNP at [**Location (un) 47**] which was from
136 to 260, and then declined to 219 on [**2188-12-18**].  She had a
CK which peaked at 298 at the outside hospital.  The CK had a
corresponding MB of 13.4.  At the time of admission to [**Hospital3 **], she had a CK of 37 with a troponin I of 0.3.

EKG on admission to [**Hospital3 **] revealed that she was in
atrial fibrillation with a rate of 74.  She had normal axis.
She had normal intervals.  She had 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions in
V4 through V6.  She also had T wave inversions in leads I,
II, and aVL.

Chest x-ray on admission revealed bilateral alveolar
infiltrates, and evidence of peribronchial cuffing, all
consistent with congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  CAD-The patient was
admitted with a non-ST elevation MI in the setting of a
pulmonary process with a peak CK of 298, which had declined
to 37 at the time of arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].  She was without
anginal symptoms.  She has a known occluded SVG on a recent
catheterization in [**2175**] as well as known RCA disease.  She is
continued on aspirin, statin, and beta blocker.  She was
weaned off her nitroglycerin drip once she was admitted.

She went to Catheterization on [**2188-12-19**] which revealed
an RCA with 50% diffuse proximal lesion, distal RCA which was
diffusely diseased, mid RCA tubular lesion that was 70-80%,
mid LAD 100% occlusion, mid circumflex 60% lesion, and the
known SVG to LAD totally occluded.  Her hemodynamic
catheterization revealed an RA pressure of 24, RV pressure of
70/24, PA pressure of 70/25, wedge of 34, cardiac output of
4.6, cardiac index of 2.4, and an ejection fraction of 51%.
No intervention was done at the time of cardiac
catheterization.  It was felt that the ischemia that she had
at the time of her initial presentation to [**Location (un) 47**] was
most likely demand ischemia in the setting of congestive
heart failure and pneumonia, and did not represent an active
thrombotic ischemic process.  It was recommended that she
have repeat catheterization in four to six weeks with
possible intervention at that time.  This was discussed with
the patient and she preferred to go home and come back for
catheterization at a later date.

Pump:  The patient has an ejection fraction of 51%, however,
her chest x-ray, wedge pressure, and other hemodynamics at
the time of catheterization reflected that she was in
congestive heart failure.  She was diuresed approximately 6
liters while admitted.  her respiratory status improved
significant and at the time of discharge she was without an
oxygen requirement.  She was bolused with Lasix p.r.n.
throughout admission, and then several days before discharge
was placed on Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.  It is unclear why she was
on Aldactone and digoxin at the time of admission, and both
of these were stopped due to the lack of evidence of class
III or class IV heart failure.  She will also be sent home
with potassium supplements in the setting of chronic Lasix
use.  She was continued on a beta blocker, however, was not
able to tolerate an ACE inhibitor at the time of discharge
due to low blood pressures.  This should possibly be
restarted as an outpatient, and she will follow-up with her
PCP.

Rhythm:  The patient has a history of chronic atrial
fibrillation for which she has been on Coumadin in the past.
Her Coumadin had been held and she was on
