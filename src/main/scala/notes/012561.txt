History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52F with T1-T2 paraplegia s/p MVC, recurent
UTI/PNA, and anxiety admitted with hypoxemia. She presented to
[**Company 191**] waiting room for an appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**9-8**], and her
routine O2 sat was 80%; BP 98/60 HR 105.  At the time pt states
she was not sob, no CP, and she was placed on 2L oxygen. At [**Company 191**]
her O2 sat on 2L=95%, BP 118/67, HR=85 T=97.2.  She typically
uses 2l oxygen at night but does not usually need it during the
day.  Patient endorses a more "junky" cough since the week prior
to admission, and now coughing up yellowish sputum but feeling
well otherwise.  CXR at [**Company 191**] was limited secondary to poor
penetration showing left upper lung opacification improved with
no new focal areas and persistent LLL opacity likely
representing atelectasis/effusion but cannot exclude pneumonia.
In clinic, her pOx was 93-94 on 2 L NC, with drops to 84 %
without oxygen.  She was sent to ED for hypoxia.
.
In the ED, she became hypotensive to SBP 70s, and a central line
was placed.  Levophed was started.  Patient was given
CeftriaXONE 1g for UTI, vancomycin, azithro for pneumonia, and
oxycodone for pain.  She was given 1500 cc NS.  VS upon transfer
to the MICU were T97.6 P 98 BP 88/55 --> 140/85 RR 22 O2 94%3L.

Past Medical History:
#T1 to T2 paraplegia status post a motor vehicle accident.
#Recurrent pneumonia (followed by pulm - Last [**2149-4-9**])
- Per pulm, recurrent pneumonia likely from pulmonary toilet
issues secondary to neuromuscular disease with improvement with
consistent and aggressive bronchopulmonary therapy.

>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML. Sensitive only to meropenem and pip/tazo.
-[**9-8**] Blood Cx No Growth
-[**9-11**] RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary): SPARSE GROWTH Commensal
Respiratory Flora. STAPH AUREUS COAG +. SPARSE GROWTH.
.
IMAGING:
.
- [**9-8**] Admission CXR:FINDINGS:  This is a limited examination
secondary to poor penetration. Within these limitations, left
upper lobe opacification is improved with no new focal areas of
opacification. There are no large effusions or pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The patient is
status post bilateral humeral fixation. IMPRESSION: Extremely
limited examination. Improvement in left upper lobe
Opacification with no evidence of worsening effusion.
- EKG: ST @ 100bpm, NA/NI, no acute ST-Twave changes, no change
from prior.
-[**9-12**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS: 1. No evidence of pulmonary
embolism. 2. Atelectatic changes at both lung bases, with some
hypoenhancements
suggesting some degree of superimposed infection as well. In the
presence of tracheal secretions, aspiration is a consideration.
3. Unchanged appearance of the right paravertebral soft tissue
mass adjacent to the azygoesophageal recess and posterior to the
left atrium. 4. Right hilar lymphadenopathy has decreased since
the prior examination. 5. Left-sided internal jugular vein
catheter tip is in the region of the left
brachiocephalic vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51-yo woman with T1-T2 paraplegia, COPD, multiple
recent admissions for pneumonia, who was admitted to the MICU
with hypoxia and altered mental status found on vital signs at
[**Hospital 3782**] clinic. After being on pressors for about 24hrs, she
stabilized and was transferred to the regular medicine floor on
[**9-11**].
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#. Hypoxia: The patient was found to be significantly hypoxic in
the ED.  Her exam, CXR, leukocytosis, and increased sputum
initially suggested pneumonia and she was started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics.  She was treated with vancomycin
given coag + staph on prelim sputum Cx, ciprofloxacin for
empiric pseudomonal coverage, and meropenem for UTI (see below).
She was given nebulisers, and her O2 sats remained in the high
80's on 2-3L NC. Her oxygen requirements stabilized over the
course of her MICU stay and she was transferred to the regular
medicine floor on [**9-11**] with vitals Temp 98.8F, BP 92/56, HR 80,
R 24, O2-sat 98% 4L.
.
On the medicine floor, the pt was feeling better and did not c/o
SOB. She occasionally desatted to the 80's when feeling anxious
and tearful, but otherwise remained in the 90's on 2L NC. She
was initially continued on vancomycin, meropenem, and
ciprofloxacin. Given persisting hypoxia since admission, CTA
chest [**9-12**] was ordered which showed no evidence of pulonary
e
