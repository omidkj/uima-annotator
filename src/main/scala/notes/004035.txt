PRESENT ILLNESS:
1.  Acute renal failure.
2.  Resolving urinary tract infection, status post klebsiella
urosepsis.
3.  Prolonged ventilator dependence.
4.  Status post [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome.
5.  Diabetes mellitus.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**] is a 75-year-old
female with a history of insulin dependent diabetes,
hypertension, morbid obesity, coronary artery disease, status
post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2188-3-25**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, congestive heart
failure with normal ejection fraction who was transferred
from [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation and therapy of acute
renal failure, [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome and persistent ventilator
dependence with metabolic acidosis and resolving Klebsiella
urosepsis.

Patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2188-3-14**] for evaluation of congestive heart
failure and was found to have severe three vessel disease by
cardiac catheterization.  She underwent three vessel coronary
artery bypass graft on the [**3-18**] with initial
postoperative complication of pneumonia and urinary tract
infection that were treated with Ciprofloxacin.  She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further rehabilitation
on the [**2-28**].  There, she developed left lower lobe
pneumonia and sternal wound infection/dehiscence which grew
out staphylococcus and enterococcus.  She was started on
levofloxacin and vancomycin, and then transferred back to the
SICU at [**Hospital3 **] on [**4-1**] for further evaluation and
management.  There, she was found to have a left pleural
effusion that required placement of a chest tube.  On the
[**4-3**], she was taken to the Operating Room for
debridement and flap reconstruction over her sternal wound.
Her postoperative course after this procedure was complicated
by pressor requirements, persistent hypoxia and metabolic
alkalosis of unclear etiology treated with diamox.  Also, she
failed extubation and underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy
on the [**4-18**], and several bronchoscopies were
significant only for chronic inflammatory changes.  During
this period, she also developed left arm weakness which was
evaluated by Neurology.  Their differential was a brachial
plexopathy versus cord injury versus a right MCA stroke.

She was discharged at [**Hospital1 **] again on the [**4-23**] with a PICC line in place and her flaps intact.  Her
total course of intravenous vancomycin was scheduled for six
weeks.

While at the rehabilitation facility, she developed multiple
medical issues that complicated her management.
1.  [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome:  On [**5-6**], she developed increasing
abdominal distention, discomfort and occasional emesis on
tube feeds.  Gastrointestinal evaluated her the [**5-13**]
and recommended bowel arrest, rectal and nasogastric tube
decompression.  A KUB on [**5-19**] showed that the cecum was
still dilated to 16.5 cm and so she was continued NPO.  Her
exam had no improved at the time of transfer to Medical
Intensive Care Unit.
[**Unit Number **].  Klebsiella urosepsis:  Patient apparently had
intermittent temperature spikes with leukocytosis concerning
for continued sternal wound infection.  Vancomycin was
continued past the six week course but on [**5-19**], she was
started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for broader coverage.  The
Flagyl was begun for concern of toxic megacolon.  On [**5-22**],
both urine and [**2-27**] blood culture bottles grew out generally
pansensitive Klebsiella pneumonia.  She was given a single
dose of gentamicin on the 28th and vancomycin was
discontinued secondary to worsening renal failure.
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were continued.  At the time of
transfer back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, it was felt
that her sepsis was resolving.
3.  Acute renal failure:  Creatinine on [**5-15**] was 0.8.  On
[**5-22**], it was 3.0 and on [**5-26**] was 5.0.  While at [**Hospital1 5593**], she was seen by the renal attending Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  Her urinalysis at the time was notable for granular
casts.  It was the feeling of the renal team, that Mrs.
[**Known lastname 20728**] had developed acute renal failure secondary to acute
tubular necrosis induced by sepsis and intravascular
depletion.  She was started on a Lasix drip and renal dosed
dopamine.  The documentation is unclear, but she appears to
have been anuric for some time but on the [**6-23**], her
urine output is noted to be 300-400 cc.  While she was at the
rehabilitation facility, an ultrasound was obtained that
showed no evidence of hydronephrosis but there was a question
of horseshoe kidney.
4.  Ventilatory dependence:  The patient has been unable to
be weaned off the ventilator for unclear reasons.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.9
(rectal).  Heart rate 64.  Blood pressure 117/42.
Respiratory rate 14.  Oxygen saturation 100% ventilatory
setting:  SIMV 14/750/5/5/30%.  General:  She was alert and
oriented times three in no acute distress.  The tracheostomy
was in place and she was able to respond to verbal commands.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were intact.
The oropharynx was moist.  There was no sinus tenderness and
an nasogastric tube was in place in the right naris.
Cardiovascular:  The heart had a regular rhythm and normal
rate.  No appreciable murmurs, rubs or gallops were
auscultated.  Pulmonary:  Rhonchus breath sounds bilaterally
with upper airway secretion, no wheezes, no crackles.
Abdominal exam:  Obese, moderately distended, diffusely
tender, no rebound, no guarding, scant bowel sounds, right
longitudinal surgical wound with inferior aspect wound and
packed with mild erythema.  Midline longitudinal surgical
with subxiphoid aspect open and packed. Extremities:  3+
pitting edema with venous stasis changes in both lower
extremities.  Pulses in feet barely palpable but warm.
Neurological:  Strong grasp right hand, weak grasp left hand.
Can wiggle toes, but cannot move legs.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.8, hematocrit
27.4, platelets 184,000, PT 15.3, PTT 29.6, INR 1.5, sodium
126, potassium 2.9, chloride 93, bicarbonate 16, BUN 88,
creatinine 5.2, anion gap 17, calcium 7.5, magnesium 1.8,
phosphorus 5.6.  Arterial blood gases 7.45/25/131.  KUB:  No
air fluid levels, no free air, no cecal dilation noted.

Chest x-ray:  Persistent left lower lobe collapse with
consolidation and left pleural effusion.  Cannot exclude
infectious etiology.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was brought to [**Hospital3 **] on
SIMV for unclear reasons.  A tracheostomy was in place and
she was quickly changed over to pressure support ventilation,
pressure support of 10.  PEEP 7.5, FIO2 40% which she
tolerated very well.  She was also given Atrovent nebulizers
every six hours.  This appeared to lower her plateau
pressures.  On [**5-29**], she was placed on a trachea mask and
was able to tolerate that for two hours, though she did
demonstrate a thoracoabdominal breathing pattern.  Through
the rest of her admission, the trachea mask trials were
advanced on a daily basis.  By [**6-3**], she was able to go
six hours on 50% trachea mask with no signs of distress or
discomfort.

2.  Renal failure:   Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**] was closely followed by the
Medical Intensive Care Unit Team and the Renal consult team.
It was the feeling of all involved, that most of her acute
renal failure at this point was due to acute tubular
necrosis.  In support of this, she had muddy brown casts in
her urine, a urine sodium of 69 and a calculated FeNA of
greater than 1.  Her Lasix strip was discontinued upon
admission to our Medical Intensive Care Unit.  However, she
continues to generate a good urine output, approximately 50
cc per hour without any diuretic support.  In addition to
this, the patient appeared to have a nongap metabolic
acidosis.  Electrolyte studies were sent away on the urine
and stool and they suggested renal wasting of bicarbonate,
