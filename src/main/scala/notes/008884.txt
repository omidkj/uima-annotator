Chief Complaint:
ICD firing x3

EP study with ablation


History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 yo Mandarin speaking male with PMH of
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25%, s/p ICD placement in [**12-10**]
for VT with associated syncope, who presents with ICD firing and
VT. Of note his ICD has fired on three separate occasions since
its placement. Most recently it fired prior to his admission
[**4-11**]. At that time his medication regimen was adjusted and he
was discharged on mexiletine 200mg [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 12.5mg
[**Hospital1 **]. His sotalol was discontinued due to QTc prolongation.
.
He reports that he was in his usual state of health today, was
walking his granddaughter to school when he felt his ICD shock.
He sat down and he felt it shock twice more. He did not fall or
injury himself at the time of the shock. He reports pain due to
the shock but denies any any other preceding chest pain,
dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, weakness,
palpitation or other symptoms.
.
In the ED T98.5 HR 84 RR18 BP 117/75 RR 18 99% 4L NC. He was
given 1L NS. He was evaluated by EP who interrogated his
pacemaker and noted that he had VT with rate in 150's, got
antitachycardia paced x3 and then had ICD firing.
.
On initial arrival to the floor he reports feeling in his usual
health but is afraid that his pacemaker will fire again and is
frustrated that it has happened again. Shortly after arrival to
the floor he went back into sustained, stable VT, rate in the
140's -150's and was shocked x1. EP was present on the floor and
went to bedside. His pacemaker was interrogated and his
Anti-tachycardia pacing rate was decreased to pace for a rate of
135. He had several prolonged periods of VT lasting greater than
5 minutes, he had several rounds of AT pacing that did not break
his VT however he eventually converted back into sinus rhythm on
his own. His blood pressure was stable throughout the episode
ranging from SBP 100-120's. He was given amiodarone 150mg IV
bolus x2 and started on an amiodarone gtt.


Past Medical History:
-Ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD placement in [**12-10**]
-mechanical AVR in [**Country 651**] [**2113**] due to presumed endocarditis from

a septic knee.
-non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (possibly alcoholic) with an EF of

20-30% and focal inferobasal an apical aneurysm.
-systolic CHF with EF 20-30% per ECHO [**2-9**]
-arthritis
-hypertension
-hyperlipidemia


Social History:
He arrived in this country from [**Country 651**] 1 year ago (although
travels back frequently), currently living with his son and his
family. Formerly smoked 2ppd x 40 years but quit 6 months ago,
Etoh use significant for red wine 1 bottle/day for over 20 years
but none in past several months.

Pertinent Results:
[**2141-6-23**] CXR:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Incomplete
visualization of the attachment of the pacemaker/defibrillator
leads to the AICD device in the left axilla, otherwise leads are
intact.

[**2141-6-21**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage identified.
2. Questionable filling defect seen adjacent to a markedly
thinned left
ventricular apex. These findings are discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time
of dictation.

[**2141-6-21**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %)
with akinesis to dyskinesis of the inferior and lateral walls.
There is a focal apical inferior aneurysm . Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

EKG demonstrated regular WCT, rate 100, possibly SR/ST with LBBB
vs accel jxnl with no significant change compared with prior
dated [**2141-6-21**].

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2141-12-18**] demonstrated:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
no
obstructive coronary disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCX, and RCA.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right heart
pressures with an RA of 7 mm Hg, RVSP of 37 mm Hg, PASP of 37 mm
Hg, and moderately elevated mean PCW pressure of 20 mm Hg.
Cardiac output was 4.7 and cardiac index 2.7.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Moderately elevated PCW pressure with mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
OTHER TESTING:
.
[**2141-6-15**] CXR: Mild cardiomegaly is noted which appears
improved when compared to previous exams from [**2140-12-3**]
and [**1-3**] of [**2141**]. The patient is status post median
sternotomy with fractured superior mediastinal wire unchanged in
position. A left-sided AICD is in unchanged position. Pulmonary
vasculature is within normal limits. Right-sided pleural
thickening is stable. No focal pulmonary opacities are
identified. A likely left-sided nipple shadow is identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 yo Mandarin-speaking male with likely ETOH DCM,
EF 30%, s/p ICD placement in [**12-10**] for VT, failed prior
ablation, sotalol, and mexiletine, who presents following ICD
firing.

1)Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia - s/p PPM/ICD placement for
VT in [**12/2140**], has failed prior attempts at ablation as well as
sotalol and mexiletine.  On admission he had ventricular
tachycardia with rate in the 140's-150's that was sustaining >5
minutes and he was not anti-tachycardia pacing out of his VT.
His ICD fired once shortly after admission.  He remained
hemodynamically stable but was transferred to CCU for closer
monitoring and started on amiodarone IV bolus +gtt.  He had EP
study with ablation of several inducible sites of VT on [**2141-6-20**]
however it was unclear if they were able to ablate the site that
was causing the VT.  He was hypotensive s/p EP procedure with
SBP in 70's -80's despite IVF bolus of about 5L.  He had a ECHO
post procedure which did not show any evidence of pericardial
effusion or worsened systolic function and he had a CT scan
which did not show any evidence of RP bleeding.  About 32 hours
after his EP study and ablation his blood pressure returned to
[**Location **] with systolic in 110's.  He did not have any recurrance
of his VT over the next two days and was discharged on
amiodarone and metoprolol.

2)Acute Renal Failure - baseline creatinine 1.1 on admission,
elevated to 1.4 during this admission most likely due to
pre-renal/dehydration.  Creatinine returned to 1.1 afte
