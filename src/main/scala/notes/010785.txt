Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
arterial line placement/removal

History of Present Illness:
66 yo female with h/o COPD on home O2, OSA, DM2, morbid obesity
who presents with two days of dyspnea and diarrhea. She states
that she has been feeling more SOB for the last 2 days, even
without doing much activity. She has been wheezing and feeling
lightheaded with this. She does have a non-productive cough, but
thinks that this has been going on for a long time. She denies
fevers, chills, sore throat or chest pain. She called an
ambulance today because she felt as if she couldn't breath. In
addition to these symptoms, she thinks that she has been having
some diarrhea in the last 1-2 days. She has not looked at it, so
does not know if it was watery or bloody. Has some mild
abdominal pain with no N/V.
.
In the ER her initial sat was 77% on RA, with a RR of 40 and she
was audibly wheezy. She was placed on a [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 597**] with improvement in
sats to 97%. She was treated with combivent nebs x3, 125 mg IV
solumedrol and azithromycin. Her sats went down to the upper
80s-low 90s on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was placed on a continuous
nebulizer and sats improved. Additionally, her SBP was noted to
be in the low 100s, she was treated with 500 cc of NS and her
SBP improved to the 120s.
.
Upon arrival to the floor the pt was conversant and stated her
breathing felt better. ABG was 7.28/74/36. Shortly after arrival
she became more somnolent, she was placed on bipap and repeat
ABG was 7.30/68/35.
.
ROS: Denies fevers, chills, ST, chest pain, dysuria, N/V,
palpitations.
Does have wheezing, increasing LE edema and diarrhea as
described above.

.
Echo [**6-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac
output. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2199-4-20**], the findings are similar.
.
CXR [**4-27**]: Stable cardiomegaly. No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

.
EKG: NSR with rate of 91, nl axis, nl intervals, no ST
elevations or depressions, TWF in II,AVl, V6 are old


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo female with h/o COPD, OSA, DM2, morbid obesity who
presents with dyspnea, likely COPD exacerbation.
.
# Respiratory Distress: Pt with underlying COPD with h/o
multiple admissions for bipap and intubations in the past. Wears
3-3.5L of NC O2 at baseline. Likely that symptoms are d/t a COPD
exacerbation, as pt is diffusely wheezy on examination and
responded to steroids and nebulizer treatments. ABGs c/w chronic
compensated respiratory acidosis, with slight component of acute
respiratory acidosis. Her WBC is elevated, but she does not have
a new cough, fevers, chills or infiltrate on x-ray to suggest
PNA. In the setting of recent diarrhea, could also have
component of viral URI causing some respiratory distress. Pt
does have questionable history of diastolic heart failure for
which she is on lasix. She has noticed some increased LE edema,
but exam, CXR and low BPs do not suggest volume overload. BNP
somewhat elevated at 396.  She was continued on bipap overnight
and changed to nasal cannula during the day.  Regular neb
treatments continued.  Started on IV steroids with transition to
PO prednisone with taper.  Azithromycin continued.  Arterial
line was placed for frequent ABGs (also concern of hypotension
at first).  She improved with these measures and was tolerating
O2 by nasal cannula at home O2 flows.  She will continue
treatment at pulmonary rehab.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC elevated at 17.6 with left shift. Pt denies
fevers, chills, new cough or dysuria. Only source is slight
abdominal pain and diarrhea. Could be d/t infectious diarrhea or
viral syndrome. CXR with no definite infiltrate. Urinalysis and
culture negative.  Legionella urine antigen negative.
Decreasing WBC counts at discharge.  Pt afebrile.  Azithromycin
was given for COPD flare.
.
# Hypotension: Pt relatively hypotensive in the ER with SBPs in
the upper 90s that improved with fluids. Upon arrival to the ICU
her pressures were initially stable and then dropped to 78
systolic by noninvasive methods. Bolus was started and a-line
was placed, SBP readings in the low 100s. Antihypertensives
initially held but quickly restarted with blood pressures at
goal.
.
# Anemia: Hct at recent baseline of 33-35.
.
# Schizophrenia: Continued outpt regimen of risperdone and
fluoxetine.
.
# GERD: continued pantoprazole.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin.
