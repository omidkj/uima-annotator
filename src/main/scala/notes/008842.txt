Service:  MED

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman
with a history of congestive heart failure with the last
echocardiogram prior to examination revealing an ejection
fraction of 75 percent with 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and
increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, atrial
fibrillation, and colon carcinoma status post colectomy
presenting with congestive heart failure and anemia.  On
admission, the patient reported increased shortness of breath
and trouble walking secondary to lower extremity edema for
five days prior to admission.  He did not take his Lasix the
morning of admission.  On the day of admission, the patient
had not taken any Lasix.  He denied chest pain, fever,
chills, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  His recent
weight is 147 pounds when he is dry, but he was 157 pounds on
admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive heart failure:  Echocardiogram in [**2159-2-20**]
showed mild dilated left atrium with mild left ventricular
hypertrophy, left ventricular function of greater than 75
percent, mild atrial fibrillation, trace aortic insufficiency,
and 1+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation along
with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
2. Atrial fibrillation anticoagulated on Coumadin.
3. Pancytopenia, this is most likely secondary to mitral valve
stenosis, but the patient has undergone a bone marrow biopsy.
He was started on Epogen on [**2160-3-4**].
4. Transient ischemic attacks.
5. Colon carcinoma status post colectomy.
6. Glaucoma.
7. Cerebrovascular accident.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratories on admission revealed white
blood cell count 3.6, hematocrit 21.6, platelets 108.
Differential 78 lymphocytes, 1 band, 8 leukocytes, 1
monocyte, 12 atypical.  Chemistries, sodium 177, potassium
5.4, chloride 92, bicarbonate 29, BUN 67, creatinine 2.9,
glucose 97, creatinine kinase 154, CKMB 14, troponin-T of
0.04.  Chest x-ray:  Stable cardiomegaly, pulmonary and
axillary distribution consistent with mild congestive heart
failure, without pulmonary edema or effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Congestive heart failure - The patient with significantly
volume overloaded on admission with severe lower extremity
edema from volume overload seen on chest x-ray.  The patient
was aggressively diuresed with Lasix initially on admission.
Initially Foley catheter was placed to monitor ins and outs
and creatinine was followed very closely. The crackles in the
left lobe were improved and the patient had evidence of
becoming dry with an increase in creatinine by [**2160-3-25**].
At that time his Lasix was held as his pulmonary status was
stable.  However, on [**2160-3-25**], the patient became
hypotensive which continued to be a problem over the next 24
hours.  This was possibly secondary to urosepsis and required
large fluid boluses to maintain his blood pressure.  In the
setting of this increased intravenous fluid, the patient's
congestive heart failure worsened and he was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit.  In the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient was once again aggressively diuresed using Lasix
and prn Metolazone.  On [**2160-3-31**], the patient was able to
return to the floor for continued care.  He was diuresed
throughout the remainder of this hospital stay with a good
result.  His creatinine has remained stable during this time.
[**Male First Name (un) **] hose were applied to the legs bilaterally and his legs
and right arm were kept elevated.  The patient will be
discharged on a standing Lasix dose.

2. Coronary artery disease - The patient was found to have a
new right bundle branch block on admission.  Laboratory data
revealed an elevated MB index and slightly elevated troponin
0.4 to 0.6.  These findings were thought to be most likely
___________related.  The patient was monitored on telemetry
without _________________during the early parts of admission.
An echocardiogram was repeated to evaluate for new wall defect
and provide further ______________ regarding the patient's
congestive heart failure.  Echocardiogram on [**2160-3-24**]
showed in left ventricular function of greater than 55
percent.  The left and right atrium are moderately dilated.
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal
ventricular cavity size.  Regional and ventricular wall motion
was normal.  Mild aortic valve stenosis, periventricular and
preventricular, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.  Mild tricuspid
regurgitation 1+, mild pulmonary _____________________.  The
patient was continued on aspirin and beta blocker throughout
her admission.

3. Atrial fibrillation - The patient is on Coumadin for
anticoagulation at home and a beta blocker for rate control.
On admission, his INR was supertherapeutic at 3.6.  Therefore
his Coumadin was held to allow the INR to trend down.  His
Coumadin was then restarted with goal INR ranged between 2 and
3.  The patient is therapeutic at this time.  He continues on
beta blocker with good rate control.

4. Infectious disease - The patient showed no evidence of
infection on admission.  However, on [**2160-3-25**], he became
hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 70.  This was
responsive to intravenous fluids.  The patient was pancultured
and was found to have urosepsis with 10:100,000 of
Enterobacter ACA grown on culture.  The patient required
transfer to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2160-3-26**] for blood
pressure support and diuresis consistent with congestive heart
failure.  Thereupon he was started on a course of
Ciprofloxacin and will complete a ten day course for his
urosepsis.  Blood cultures have been negative during
admission.  At this time he is afebrile with a normal white
blood cell count.

5. Renal - The patient had acute and chronic renal failure at
the time of presentation.  His creatinine was followed closely
as he diuresed.  During admission, he did have an increase in
creatinine during which time his Lasix was held.  However, his
Lasix was now trended down and he is tolerating daily diuresis
with a creatinine below his baseline.

6. Myeloid dysplastic syndrome - The patient is pancytopenic
at baseline thought to be secondary to myeloid dysplastic
syndrome, although this has not been confirmed with a bone
marrow biopsy.  On admission, he was transfused three units of
packed red blood cells.  His hematocrit and platelets have
been fairly stable within the range since that time.  His
hematocrit has been followed closely with a goal transfusion
for hematocrit less than or equal to 28.

7. Rehabilitation - Physical therapy has been working
extensively with the patient.  They have recommended discharge
to a rehabilitation facility.

8. Code - The patient i
