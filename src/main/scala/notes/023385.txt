HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:  2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  As noted previously the patient had wheezing and
dyspnea on admission with oxygen saturation 84% on room air,
which improved with nebulizers and Lasix treatment.  The
patient was started on IV Solu-Medrol for treatment of a
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare with nebulizers
with marked improvement over the course of her hospital stay.
The patient was eventually transitioned to a oral Prednisone
taper and by the day of discharge was nearly completing that
course.  The patient had a repeat chest x-ray two days prior
to discharge, which demonstrated the resolution of some
previously noted small effusions and atelectasis and noted no
new lung lesions.  The patient's lungs were clear by the day
of discharge.

3.  GI/aspiration risk.  Early in the patient's course the
patient underwent a swallowing study, which demonstrated a
high risk of aspiration.  Therefore the patient was fed with
tube feeds via an NG tube.  Following resolution of the
patient's primary infection the patient's mental status
improved and the patient was reevaluated by swallowing study
who felt that although she was a high risk of aspirating
liquids she could tolerate soft solids and pureed foods.
However, the patient had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status over
the hospital course and her ability to eat without aspiration
was extremely variable.  It was ultimately decided to place
an NG tube in the patient then and refeed with tube feeds to
prevent the aspiration risk.  A family discussion one day
prior to discharge discussed this issue of
dysphagia/aspiration/possibility of a PEG tube.  However, the
patient's son for now feels that an NG tube is adequate at
this point with hopes that the patient will be able to eat on
her own once her condition improves.  The issue of a PEG tube
will be addressed at a later date by staff at the [**Hospital6 46219**].

4.  Thrombocytopenia.  Over the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course the
patient's platelet count was noted to decrease from an
admission count of 244 to a nadir of 76.  At that time Zantac
and heparin were discontinued and the patient's platelet
count returned to [**Location 213**] levels at 212 by the date of
discharge.  A test for antiheparin antibodies was sent, which
was negative. It was felt that the patient's drop in her
platelet count was a result of her sepsis causing possibly
low grade DIC as well as decreased platelet formation.

5.  Neurologic/mental status.  The patient was noted to have
a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status throughout her hospital
course.  The patient has a history of a left MCA middle
cerebral artery stroke and was noted to have a change in her
mental status on [**2142-5-9**] several days into her
hospital admission.  A CT of her head without contrast was
done, which demonstrated the presence of an old large infarct
in the left middle cerebral artery distribution with
associated encephalomalacic changes predominantly involving
the left parietal region.  There was a small area of low
attenuation in subcortical white matter of the right frontal
lobe, which may have represented a subacute infarct, however,
there were no signs of any acute infarct.  As the patient
defervesced on Ceftriaxone the patient's mental status
continued to wax and wane, but was remarkably better.  The
patient was noted to be quite somnolent and unresponsive in
the morning, however, by the afternoon hours the patient
generally was awake and alert and interacting near her
baseline and able to move her left lower leg and her left arm
to command and spontaneously as well as smile and laugh
appropriately.  For the two days prior to discharge, however,
the patient was noted to again to be more somnolent and less
interactive, thought to be secondary to the patient's ongoing
low grade temperatures.  As stated before no source of
infection other then yeast in her urine cultures was noted
and at the time of discharge it was decided not to treat the
yeast urinary tract infection as it was felt to be simply
colonization rather then true infection.

6.  Mild gastritis.  While the patient had NG tube placed in
her stomach it was noted that aspirates of gastric secretions
were positive for coffee ground substances.  Multiple NG tube
lavages demonstrated no active source of bleeding in the
stomach.  It was felt that the low level bleeding was
secondary to gastritis possibly exacerbated by steroid use.
The patient was continued on her Prilosec dose for the
remainder of her hospital site.

7.  Code status.  The patient was made DNR/DNI, but pressors
okay while in the hospital and during a family meeting that
took place one day prior to discharge the son expressed his
desire for a do not hospitalize order when she returns to
[**Hospital6 459**].  The staff at the [**Hospital6 459**]
would continue to treat any reversible processes at the rehab
facility, but would not traumatize her by further
hospitalizations.
