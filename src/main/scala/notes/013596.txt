Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with pericardial drain placement --
[**2136-9-12**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 yo female with a h/o IDDM, ESRD on HD,
diastolic CHF, multiple thrombi on coumadin, s/p recent
admission for HD catheter infection who presents with a
complaint of abdominal pain x 1 week.  She describes anorexia
and vomiting with any PO intake. She localizes the abdominal
pain to the RLQ, radiating to the RUQ.  Per report from The
[**Hospital3 2558**], morning vitals were notable only for a HR 122.
Patient requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to ED, T 95.6 PO, HR 122, BP 104/55, RR 17. Morphine
4 mg IV and Zofran 4 mg IV were administered on arrival for
symptom control. Following a stat lactate of 6.3 she received
Vancomycin 1 gram and Ceftazadime 2 g IV.  Patient became
hypotensive to 63/31 and a CVL was placed in the right groin.
Levophed was started. CT abdomen was performed given her
complaint of abdominal pain which revealed large pericardial
effusion.  Cardiology was called, and stat TTE was performed at
bedside, indicating tamponade physiology.  She received Vitamin
K 10 mg PO, and 1 mg IV.  4 units FFP were transfused, and she
received Profil nine 1120 units IV x 1.
.
She was taken urgently to the cath lab where 700 cc of bloody
fluid was drained.  Initial pericardial pressure in 40's down to
11 s/p drainage.  Patient was started on Dopamine gtt at
5mcg/kg/min and transferred to the CCU for further management.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA,  pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG performed on arrival to CCU demonstrated NSR, HR 100 with no
significant change compared with prior dated [**2136-8-27**].  Left axis
deviation with normal intervals.  Normal voltages.  Left
anterior fascicular block and delayed R wave progression.
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: NSR, HR 80
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2136-9-12**] demonstrated:
1. Cardiac tamponade.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of approximately
700 cc of bloody fluid.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2136-9-12**]:
1. Large pericardial fluid collection with enhancement of the
pericardium is consistent with pericarditis. Pericardial fluid
causes mass effect on the atria and ventricles. Emergent
pericardiocentesis should be considered. Right basal effusion.
2. Enlarged gallbladder and common duct. Recommend HIDA scan to
rule out acute cholecystitis.
3. Normal appendix without evidence of obstruction or ischemia.
4. There is an AV fistula in the right groin with contrast in
the right iliac vein and IVC
.
PRE-PROCEDURE TTE [**2136-9-12**]:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is a large
pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w organization. There is right ventricular
diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology.
.
POST-PROCEDURE TTE [**2136-9-12**]:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2136-9-12**], the pericardial effusion
has nearly resolved. RV and RA diastolic collapse are no longer
seen (tamponade resolved post-pericardiocentesis).
