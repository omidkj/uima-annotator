Pertinent Results:
[**2186-5-16**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this left
dominant system with known occluded right coronary artery
revealed three vessel disease. The LMCA had a 60% calcified
stenosis.  The LAD had a total occlusion in the mid segment at
the previously placed stents (Taxus within a Cypher). There were
no collaterals supplying the LAD territory.  The LCX had a 40%
stenosis at the proximal segment and the origin of the OM1 had a
70% stenosis.  The OM@ had mild disease.  The OM3 had a proximal
50% stenosis.  The OM4 had a 70% stenosis at its origin, which
was focal in nature.  The LPDA had mild disease. 2. Angiography
of the LIMA revealed a patent vessel.  This was done in
anticipation of likely upcoming surgery. 3. Resting hemodynamics
demonstrated systolic arterial hypertension with central aortic
pressure of 163/78 mm Hg.
[**5-17**] CT: 1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. 2. Stable
splenic and lung calcifications likely represent the sequela of
prior granulomatous disease. 3. Extensive atherosclerotic
calcifications are similar to [**2186-1-12**]. 4. Cholelithiasis without
evidence of cholecystitis.
[**5-17**] Carotid U/S: There is less than 40% stenosis within the
internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
[**2186-5-19**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta
are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40
cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results on Mr. [**Known lastname **] at 8AM. Post_Bypass: Normal RV systolic
function. Mild improved in the mid and apical anterior walls of
LV. LVEF 40% to 45% Intact thoracic aorta. Trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
IABP is in place approx 4 cm below the left subclavian artery.
[**2186-5-21**] CXR: NG tube, ET tube, left chest tube, and mediastinal
drains have been removed. The Swan-Ganz catheter was replaced by
right internal jugular line with its tip being at the level of
mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or increased
pleural effusion. The left retrocardiac atelectasis is
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the history of present illness, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
presented to [**Hospital1 **] with chest pain. He was ruled in for ST segment
myocardial infarction and was brought for a cardiac cath. Cath
revealed occluded LAD at previous stent placement along with 60%
left main disease. Balloon angioplasty was performed to LAD and
a Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed. Post-cath he was brought
to the ICU for further management. Hematocrit dropped after cath
and he received a blood transfusion along with CT to rule-out
retroperitoneal bleed (CT was negative). He remained stable in
the ICU while awaiting surgery and required other diagnostic
studies prior to bypass surgery. On [**5-19**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 5. Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. On post-op day one the balloon pump was
removed and he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically
intact and extubated. On post-op day two he was transferred to
the telemetry for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. Physical therapy
followed patient during his post-op course and at time of
discharge felt he would require additional rehab due to weakness
and history of falls. On post-op day four he was discharged to
rehab with appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.
