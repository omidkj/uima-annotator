Attending:[**Known firstname 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Sustained stable VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation


History of Present Illness:
65M with a history of inferior posterior MI s/p three vessel
CABG in [**2094**] with a large residual scar and recurrent VT s/p VT
ablation on [**2110-12-18**] and discharged from the CCU service on
[**2110-12-21**] who presents with recurrent symptomatic VT. He reports
that he started having a feeling of palpitations and increased
DOE and SOB even at rest starting at some point on Saturday. He
denies CP, nausea, chest pressure, radiation, LE edema,
orthopnea, or PND - but he wears a CPAP mask. He did have some
night sweats. Today when he reported these symptoms to his
cardiologist, he was referred to the [**Hospital1 **] ED. In the ED
there he was in and out of VT. His pacer was interrogated with
showed recurrent VT ongoing with some ATP and 18 continuous
hours of VT on Saturday. He has a report of a BP of 59/34 there,
but all other BPs were 100s/80s. Given this, he was transfered
to here for further management.
.
In our ED, initial VS were T 97.8, P 60, BP 110/71, RR 20, O2sat
99%. He went into a perfusing VT at around 130/min with a BP of
101/72. He was symptomatic, but not syncopal or presyncopal. He
was bolused with lidocaine 100 mg IV x1 and started on a drip at
1 mg/min with no improvement in his VT. He was admitted to the
CCU for further management.
.
On the floor, he feels well. He complains of mild cough and a
sensation that he cannot take a deep breath. Otherwise, he has
no complaints.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2110-12-30**]
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
There is moderate cardiomegaly. Hilar and mediastinal contours
are stable with a tortuous thoracic aorta. A left chest wall
pacemaker with two leads in the expected position of the right
ventricle are present. An additional lead terminates in the SVC,
and is unchanged since the prior study. Multiple sternotomy
wires and mediastinal surgical clips, suggestive of prior CABG.
The lungs are moderately well expanded. There is mild increase
in the interstitial markings, suggestive of mild pulmonary
edema. The pleural surfaces are smooth without pleural effusion
or pneumothorax. The retrocardiac left lung base atelectasis has
improved.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable moderate cardiomegaly, with mild pulmonary congestion.
2. No evidence of pneumonia.
3. Pacer leads position, as described above.
.
CXR [**2110-12-31**]
FINDINGS: A left ICD is seen with two leads in the right
ventricle and one
lead in the upper SVC. The upper SVC lead was previously within
the right
atrium on prior CT. Left basilar atelectasis is minimal. Minimal
pulmonary
venous engorgement is seen without overt pulmonary edema. There
is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly and a
slightly tortuous aorta are unchanged.
 .
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimal pulmonary venous engorgement without overt pulmonary
edema.
2. Pacer lead positions as described above.
.
EKG [**2110-12-30**]:
Ventricular tachycardia with a fusion beat. Compared to the
previous tracing, ventricular tachycardia is new.


Brief Hospital Course:
65M with CAD s/p MI and CABG, CHF, HTN, HLD, VT s/p prior
ablation and recent placement of an [**Company 1543**] AICD initially
admitted to the floor, but transferred to the CCU with stable,
perfusing VT, refractory to lidocaine for VT ablation procedure.
.
# RHYTHM: On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was in a perfusing
ventricular tachycardia rhythm with BP 101/72 and rate in 130's.
He complained of palpatations but was mentating well and not
presyncopal. He was bolused with Lidocaine 100mg and started on
a lidocaine drip without improvment in VT. On arrival to the
CCU, he remained in VT in the 110-130 range and was
normotensive. Home dose of Mexilitine and sotalol were
discontinued and he was started on quinidine 324 mg PO Q8H and
metoprolol 25mg TID. On HD2 his rhythm alternated between slow,
perfusing VT and sinus rhythm. He was seen by electrophysiology
who idenitifed the rhythm as re-entrant sinus tachycardia and
performed an ablation when INR <2. Warfarin was intitially held
prior to the procedure, then restarted with LMWH bridge, to be
continued as an outpatient at his home dose with routine INR
checks. He will be continued on quinidine 486mg daily, which may
interfere with metabolism of coumadin, requiring a lower dose to
keep his INR within proper range.  He was also given higher
doses of 10mg and 7.5mg prior to discharge to bring his INR to
therapeutic range slightly faster.  These dose adjustments will
need to be followed by his PCP or coumadin clinic.  He will
follow-up with EP as an outpatient in about 1 month and should
continue to hold the sotalol and mexilitine until his follow-up
appointment.
.
# Blood pressure control: While in the CCU, his BPs were
borderline hypotensive, so it was not aggressively controled and
he was given B-blockers as tolerated.  His home lisinopril will
be held for 1 week after discharge and restarted at his home
dose after that.  He will continue on metoprolol at half-dose of
hi
