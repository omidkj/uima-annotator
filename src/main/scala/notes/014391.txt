Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 25518**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
52 yo IDDM on insulin pump with recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**2129-5-20**] after admission for poorly controlled DM and recent
discharge from psych facility after diagnosed with depression w/
psychotic features presents from OSH with concern for NSTEMI,
but found to be in DKA.  According to patient she has been
urinating 10-12 times per day for a day or 2.  She has been
drinking a lot of ice tea and other liquids as well because she
is thristy.  Yesterday afternoon the patient noticed her FSG was
greater than 600.  She said that prior to yesterday afternoon,
her readings were not that high.  She bolused herself with an
insulin pump and recheck continued to be greater than 600.  She
had been doing really well with the pump, but had it changed
over the weekend because her old one was scratched.  She did not
notice that the pump was having any error signals or not working
properly.  She went to bed the night prior to admission and woke
up around 1am with CP.  She took nitro and her pain improved.
She fell back asleep and then woke up at 3am and had recurrent
CP.  She had some N/V took nitro and her pain improved, but she
went to [**Hospital3 **] for further evaluation.  At LGH trop
0.13 and FSG 800's.  She was sent here for further management of
possible NSTEMI.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.8 101 121/66 20 100% 2L.  Labs
and imaging significant for Na: 132, HCO3 13, Glu 666, AG 24,
WBC 20.3 ( N:91.6 L:6.8 M:1.4 E:0 Bas:0.2), urine glucose 1000,
ketones 80, lactate of 4.0.  She was initially transferred for
NSTEMI, and prior to her labs returning, she had bradycardia to
the 40's eyes rolled to back of head, no pulse, asystolic,
within 10 seconds pulse again, awake, alert.  She had persistent
hypotension and RIJ placed and started on levophed.  She was
also noted to have EKG changes in the ED with STE in aVR and V1
and depressions in I, II, V4-6 thought to be demand ischemia in
setting of DKA.  Insulin drip was started in the ED and 4.5L of
NS was given.  Given bradycardia, hypotension and EKG changes,
she will be admitted to the CCU for further management.  Prior
to transfer due to sustained hypotension, she was started on
dopamine.  Cipro and calcium gluconate was also given in the ED
for unclear reasons at this time.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient awake, alert, very thirsty, but
otherwise feeling well.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid-
and distal anterior/anteroseptal/apical hypokinesis, as well as
hypokinesis of the basal inferior/inferoseptal segments. There
is milder hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25-30%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild g
