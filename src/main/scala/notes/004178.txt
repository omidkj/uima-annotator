Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent
foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the apex and hyperkinesis of the
basal and mid segments. The remaining left ventricular segments
contract normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST BYPASS: Marginally improved focal LV systolic function.
Intraaortic balloon pump in good position. There is still
inducible [**Male First Name (un) **] with systolic BP in the range of 90-110 with
moderate MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] systolic function. No other changes.
