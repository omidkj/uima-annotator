Chief Complaint:
Seizure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 3968**] [**Known lastname 79941**] is a 90 woman with a history of a seizure
disorder
on Keppra. She is known to the neurology department from prior
admissions, most recently in [**2191-9-16**] when she presented
to the hospital with altered mental status and was found to be
in
status. Neurology has been today for concern of a similar
presentation.

The patient lives with son who does her ADLS. Per report, last
night he briefly left the home and on return he found her
unresponsive with her lips blue. EMS came and put her on
non-rebreather. Enroute to the hospital, she was documented as
having a GTC of unclear duration. She was given 5mg valium and
the seizure resolved by the time she reached the emergency room.
In the ED, EKG demonstrated ST elevations in V2-V4. It was
initially felt that the patient was CMO so she was treated only
with rectal aspirin and admitted to the medicine floor. However,
after discussion with her family it was felt the patient would
be
DNR/DNI and so she was started on a heparin drip, ordered for
rectal plavix (not yet given) and transferred to the cardiology
floor.

At present, the patient is arousable but not able to speak. She
has been noted to have flexure posture left UE but the RUE is
rhythmically contracting. LEs are quiet. The team is loading her
with 1g Keppra IV and continuous EEG has been ordered. Because
of
her DNR/DNI status, there is a goal to avoid sedating
medications.

Per her family, the patient has not had any recent illness.
They
deny any siezures since [**Month (only) 359**] and state they always bring her
to the hospital when she has a seizure.  They have not noticed
any episodes of unresponsiveness at home.  She has not had any
known head trauma or falls.

The patient is unable to offer any history at this time.
