HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old Kenyan man
with a past medical history significant for insulin
dependent-diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and no known coronary artery disease,
who presents complaining of substernal chest pain and chest
pressure that was nonradiating, intermittent, occurred in
brief episodes at rest, and was new, along with diaphoresis
and shortness of breath, and general weakness, and fatigue
for about two days, feeling somewhat worse today.  The
patient states that he was visiting from [**Country 16465**] for a
conference.  He denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea.

In the Emergency Department, the patient arrived pain free.
He was given aspirin in route.  He was given Lopressor 5 mg
IV x1, 25 mg po x1, and Lasix 20 mg IV x1, as well as
nitropaste.  He was initially in mild apparent failure, but
was having good urine output.

5. No known renal disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Prior smoking history, but remote.  The
patient is from [**Country 16465**] and is a farmer and coffee exporter.
He has no known HIV risk factors, but had a negative HIV test
in [**Month (only) 1096**].  He is sexually active in a monogamous
relationship with his wife.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. NPH 30 units am and 20 units pm.
2. Glucophage 500 mg po q day.
3. Aspirin 81 mg po q day.

5. Unknown cholesterol medication.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.8, heart
rate 80, blood pressure 175/53, respiratory rate 24, and
oxygen saturation is 99%.  In general, in no apparent
distress, comfortable obese man.  HEENT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Mucous membranes moist.  No jugular venous
distention.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm,
decreased heart sounds, no murmurs appreciable.  Lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No rales, rhonchi, or
wheezing.  Abdomen is soft, obese, nontender, and
nondistended, and normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:  1+
pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.  Rectal
examination was guaiac negative.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES AND DIAGNOSTICS ON ADMISSION:  The
patient had a Chem-7 which revealed a sodium of 135,
potassium of 5.2, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of
34, creatinine of 1.7, and a glucose of 245.  Patient's
complete blood count revealed a white count of 7.7,
hematocrit of 33.6, normal differential, MCV of 89.
Patient's cardiac enzymes:  First set CK 453, CK MB 5,
troponin 1.8.  Second set CK 357, CK MB 4, troponin 1.8.
Third set:  CK 224, CK MB 4, troponin 2.2.  Fourth set:  CK
257, CK MB 4, troponin 2.4.  Patient's calcium was 8.3,
phosphorus 2.9, magnesium 3.2.  Coagulation profile revealed
a PT of 13.6, PTT of 29.6, and an INR of 1.2.  Fractional
excretion of sodium was 3.4%, creatinine clearance was 80.
Urinalysis revealed moderate blood and moderate protein.

Chest x-ray was consistent with cardiomegaly and diffuse
bilateral pulmonary vasculature enlargement consistent with
congestive heart failure.

Abdominal KUB revealed no free air, no obstruction, and
positive stool.

Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 66 beats
per minute, left axis deviation, P-R interval of 206, Q's in
III and aVF, T-wave flattening in I and aVL, and no ST-T
changes.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 63-year-old male with a history of
insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and no known coronary artery disease
who presents complaining of intermittent episodes of
substernal chest pain x2 days associated with diaphoresis,
shortness of breath, and fatigue concerning for unstable
angina.  He was admitted continued symptoms to rule out
myocardial infarction as well as workup for his increased
creatinine of 1.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Procedures:  The patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2177-6-9**], which revealed a right
dominant coronary vasculature, no significant obstructive
disease with normal flow, a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 30 mm Hg, and systolic hypertension.

The patient underwent an echocardiogram on [**6-10**], which
revealed mild left atrial dilatation, mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy, mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, a resting basal to mid inferior
akinesis and basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis and
akinesis, RVH, right ventricular cavity dilatation, mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, abnormal
septal motion consistent with right ventricular pressure and
volume overload, mild aortic and mitral and tricuspid valve
thickening, mild-to-moderate AR, mild MR, moderate TR, left
ventricular inflow consistent with pseudonormal pattern with
increased left sided filling pressures and impaired left
ventricular relaxation, severe pulmonary artery hypertension,
and an ejection fraction of 55%.

The patient underwent a VQ scan on [**6-12**] which was negative
for embolic disease and was suggestive of central airway
disease.  The patient underwent a chest CT scan on [**2177-6-12**] which was suggestive of congestive heart failure,
although there was a mention of very mild enlargement of
hilar lymph nodes to a nonpathologic degree as well as
mention of a small nodule measuring several mm in the lung
fields.

The patient underwent a cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**6-13**], which revealed
mild global ventricular dysfunction with regional dysfunction
of the distal anterolateral and septal walls as well as the
apex.  There is no evidence of myocardial scarring.  There is
no significant intercardiac shunt.

The patient underwent a right heart cardiac catheterization
on [**2177-6-16**].  During this procedure, a right ventricular
biopsy was attained.  The patient's pulmonary artery
pressures had decreased from the previous cardiac
catheterization from 111 to 59, but the pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure was still at around 30.  Preliminary studies
on the right ventricular biopsy had been negative for any
infiltrative disease.  Further studies were pending at the
time of this dictation.

2. Narrative of hospital course by problem:
1. Chest pain/rule out myocardial infarction:  The patient
was started on aspirin, beta blocker, Heparin and Integrilin
given the fact that he had active chest pain.  However,
cardiac catheterization showed no coronary artery disease.
As a result, Heparin and Integrilin were discontinued.  His
troponin, however, did reach a peak of greater than 2.

2. Pulmonary artery hypertension:  The workup mentioned above
under the procedure section was performed to elicit a cause
of the patient's pulmonary hypertension.  At the time of this
dictation, the leading candidate for a cause is the patient's
left heart disease and a restrictive cardiomyopathy secondary
to diabetes, hypertension, and excessive salt intake.  The
patient is being transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
monitoring and testing.

3. Diabetes:  The patient was taken off Glucophage given his
acute on chronic renal failure.  He was placed on a regular
insulin-sliding scale, and was given NPH insulin.  The
patient's insulin was titrated up in order to meet his
diabetic needs.  He was also placed on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet.  The
patient was started on Glipizide 5 mg po q day.

4. Hypertension:  The patient was optimally managed with
metoprolol, lisinopril, and diltiazem.  These were titrated
up as needed.

5. Acute renal failure versus chronic renal insufficiency:
The patient's fractional excretion of sodium was greater than
3% suggesting that the patient had intrinsic renal disease.
He was given Mucomyst around the time of his first cardiac
catheterization.  He was started on lisinopril for renal
protection.  His creatinine improved from 1.9 on admission to
1.2 the day prior to transfer to the CCU.  His creatinine did
start
