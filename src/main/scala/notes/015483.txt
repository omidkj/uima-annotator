Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
77 year old Male with  HTN/HL/COPD/HCV and recent diagnosis of
PNA, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 3278**] MC 3 wks prior to admission,
d/ced to rehab ([**Location (un) **] HC), where he was found to have
progressively worsening gait abnormality, ? urinary retention
and/or incontienence, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation of dyspnea from [**Hospital1 1501**]. No further history is available,
above obtained from son.

On arrival to the ED SBPs initially in 100s, pt. on CPAP of 5cm.
 .
In the ED, initial VS were:  136 77/58 23 98% RA.  ECG w/
regualr WCT. Initial labs Na:127, K:8.7, Cl:95, TCO2:13,
Glu:264, Lactate:2.2.  Received 2 amps CaCl, 1 amp Bicarb,
Insulin (10UR)/D50, kayexalate and 100mg IV hydrocortisone and
started on Levophed.  Pt. was intubated 7.5 ETT
(etomidate/rocuronium/fentaly/versed), with ABG 7.22/52/439.
Repeat labs notable for WBC of 12K, HCT 33%, INR 1.0, PTT46,
chem 7 of 128/9/89/13/243/18.   Renal was consulted who
recomended initiation of emergent dialysis.  Currently on
levophed 0.2 mcg/kg SBP 127/85, HR 103, 100% on 20x380x5x50%.
Noted to have frank blood per rectum and had coffee grounds.  Of
note, upon foley insertion, noted to have 3L output.
.
In addition, OG lavage showed "dark blood" and pt. was noted to
have frank blood per rectum. Was started on PPI gtt w/ 80mg IV
bolus. GI was consulted who recommended conservative management.

While in the MICU, as mentioned, he underwent emergent HD, foley
placement and received finasteride with complete recovery of
renal function (Cr 0.6 today).  He only received one HD session.
 Given concern for PNA, he was started on vancomycin and
levofloxacin (cefepime discontinued on [**3-26**]), for which he will
complete an 8 day course (day 1- [**3-24**]).  Given his hypotension,
he underwent and ECHO which revealed an interatrial septal
aneurysm.  Cardiology was consulted and recommended aspirin and
statin.  Neurology also consulted and agree with cardiology.
Neurology also following for recent history of left arm
weakness, for which they recommend a c-collar and MRI c-spine.
There was a question of cauda [**Month/Year (2) 43561**] so he was started on
methylprednisolone.  On [**3-26**], the patient coughed up a pill that
was stuck in his oropharynx.  Given this, he was made NPO and
S/S was consulted.  They are planning to do a video swallow
evaluation on [**3-28**].  He was maintained on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] while in
the MICU with an equivocal H.pylori.  In addition, while pulling
his central line yesterday, the patient became hypotensive and
hypoxic secondary to an air embolus.  ECHO at that time was
stable.  He was given lasix 10mg IV x 2 with 1.2L urine output
and resolution of symptoms.  He is being transferred to the
medicine floor for further management

On arrival to the floor, vital signs were T- 97.9, BP- 158/96,
HR- 90, RR- 18, SaO2- 99% on 2L NC.  The patient was comfortable
and AAO x 2 (person, place, "[**2132**]").

[**2188-3-24**]: MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]
FINDINGS:
There is normal anatomic alignment and vertebral body height.
There are
degenerative-type endplate changes at multilevel more evident at
L3-4 level.  Schmorl's nodes are noted at the inferior endplate
of L1 and superior endplate of L4. The spinal cord terminates at
L1-2 level, with normal distribution of the cauda [**Name13 (STitle) 43561**] nerve
roots. There are bilateral renal cysts vs. dilatation of the
right renal pelvis. There is atrophy of the paraspinal muscles.

At T11-T12 level, there is no significant disc bulge, spinal
canal stenosis, or neural
