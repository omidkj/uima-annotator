Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year-old female with osteoporosis and multiple
vertebral compression fractures status post vertebroplasty and
kyphoplasty last [**10-8**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5730**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] (T10), also with
COPD and bronchiectasis on home oxygen 2L/min for 1 month, and
chronic hyponatremia secondary to SIADH, who presents from home
with increasing back pain.
*
She reports that she has baseline back discomfort from her
multiple previous interventions, but has noted significant
worsening in the past 2 days, bilateral with midline sparing,
wrapping around to axilla bilaterally, worse at the level of her
most recent surgery but also diffuse. She denies paresthesia or
new extremity weakness, no difficulty urinating or defecating.
She denies fever or chills. On a different note, she reports
chronic severe shortness of breath, stable over the past month,
for which she uses 2L home oxygen. She denies phlegm production,
no chest pain, and endorses mild chronic LE edema which has been
attributed to her Norvasc. She sleeps with multiple pillows due
to her kyphosis and SOB, no change recently.
*
In ED, T 98.2, HR 76, BP 182/75, RR 24, Sat 100% on 2L/min. T
and L-spine X-rays did not reveal new fractures, CXR with
findings consistent with bronchiectasis, CT chest without PE but
with interval increase in bronchiectatic and peribronchial
inflammatory changes. She was evaluated by neurosurgery, deemed
to be intact neurologically. She is being admitted for ongoing
pain control.

Imaging:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2106-10-30**] 8:31 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Extensive bronchiectasis and peribronchial inflammation is
again seen, with nodular opacities adjacent to these areas
suggesting mucoid impaction or inflammation. These findings have
increased in comparison to prior study.
3. Extensive compression deformities within the thoracic spine,
with changes related to vertebroplasty.
4. Hypodensity within the left thyroid gland and an exophytic
thyroid nodule extending inferiorly.
.
CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-10-30**] 8:31 PM
IMPRESSION: Again seen are multiple compression deformities
within the thoracic and lumbar spine, with mild narrowing of the
spinal canal, greatest at T11/12 level. There is very limited
evaluation on CT of intrathecal contents, representing a concern
for cord abnormality, and further evaluation with an MRI should
be obtained.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Agree overall with above. There
is severe, diffuse osteopenia with thoracic kyphoscoliosis, but
no evidence of acute alignment abnormality. The severe T7 and
less marked T6 (and L4) compression deformities are of
indeterminate age, and an acute component cannot be excluded; in
this regard, comparison with prior (outside) cross-sectional
studies would be helpful. The moderate ventral spinal canal
narrowing at the T12 level reflects retropulsion of that dorsal
vertebral cortex. No definite vertebroplasty material is
identified within the epidural space.
.
L-SPINE (AP & LAT)  [**2106-10-30**] 5:50 PM
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in the number of vertebral bodies,
status post kyphoplasty. Probable upper thoracic spine
compression fractures, however, this is inadequately evaluated
on this examination secondary to motion.
.
T-SPINE  [**2106-10-30**] 5:50 PM
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in the number of vertebral bodies,
status post kyphoplasty. Probable upper thoracic spine
compression fractures, however, this is inadequately evaluated
on this examination secondary to motion
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2106-10-30**] 5:50 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of the chest with upper lobe interstitial
densities and bronchiectasis, stable.
2. COPD.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2106-11-1**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left  ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no left  ventricular outflow obstruction at
rest or with Valsalva. The right  ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is  normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic  valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The  mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is  seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial  effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of  [**2103-9-10**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is similar. Right  ventricle cavity size may now be
larger.
.
MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-11-2**] 9:36 AM
IMPRESSION:

1. 1.3-cm well defined round lesion in the posterior part of the
T5 vertebral body, which is indeterminate. Malignancy cannot be
excluded based on this appearance.
2. Edema in the posterior parts of the T9 and T10 vertebral
bodies, which could be related to post-vertebroplasty edema.
3. Retropulsed fragments of the collapsed vertebral bodies at
various levels, contacting the cord with narrowing of the
ventral canal at T7 and T12 levels; nerve root impingement at
T12 level cannot be excluded, but not definitive.
