History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34476**] is a 47M with a PMH s/f IDDM, ?CAD, recent
MRSA/aspiration PNA with discharge from rehab 4 days ago
(completed recent courses of vancomycin, cefepime, zosyn, and
flagyl), and recent c. diff infection [**1-/2128**] s/p 14 days of
flagyl.  By report, his HCP found him somnolent at his home
today with 100/200 oxycodone tabs missing from his pill bottle.
She took him to [**Hospital3 **], where he had a blood glucose
of 1209, and a WBC count of 32.  He was given a total of 6L NS,
1g vancomycin and an insulin drip, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In our ED, he was somnolent on admission, but arousable and able
to answer simple questions, though he could not give a detailed
history.  His initial vital signs were: T 96.6, HR 101, BP
143/56, 100%RA, RR 17.  FSBS= 500s.  He was given 1.5L NS, and
started on an insulin gtt at 10u/hr.  A 400mcg fentanyl patch
was removed.  No narcan given as the patient was arousable with
good RR.  Exam was notable for a left great toe ulcer, which did
not appear infected, bilateral foot drop, and chronic neck pain.
UA was negative for any signs of infection, and showed positive
glucose and ketones.  CBC was notable for leukocytosis to
35,000.  CXR is clear.  Blood and urine cultures sent.  Lactate
is mildly elevated to 2.3  Urine tox is negative.  Serum tox was
negative.  Electrolytes showed K+ of 4.7 and a bicarb of 11 with
an anion gap of 23.

Patient is altered, but states that he has not been having any
fevers or chills, no abdominal pain, no chest pain,
palpitations, dizziness, no diarrhea or nausea/vomiting.  He
also states that he did not take any of his home oxycodone the
day of admission.  Per OSH records, the patient reports two days
of decreased PO intake, with two episodes of vomiting overnight.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo male with IDDM, h/o MRSA PNA, C. diff, presenting with
DKA, c. difficile infection and altered mental status in setting
of narcotic abuse and acute medical illness.
   Of note, the patient's most important medical issue at this
point is his severe opiate abuse and dependence.  An extensive
family discussion was held with reports of many instances where
the patient would try to fool caregivers in increasing the
patient's opiate dosages.  These included fashioning fake kidney
stones out of paint.  The family brought documentation that the
patient was filling several different opiate scripts at
different pharmacies and using far in excess of the prescribed
dosages.
   The patient was on a whopping dose of narcotics on his
discharge from [**Hospital **] rehab including 400 mcg of fentanyl
patches and very large ocycodone prn doses.
   The patient does not have severe organic pain that
necessitates high opiate usage.  His pain will be managed
through adjunctive pain meds.  His fentanyl patch will be weaned
completely off over the next few weeks.  Note, the patient is
not to receive prn opiates.

1. DKA - Presenting BG 1200, HCO3 11, and AG 24.  Required
insulin gtt overnight in the ICU, and then transitioned to home
subcutaneous dose.  Likely initiated by C. difficile infection.
Patient was initially covered broadly with vanc/ceftaz/flagyl.
Cdiff toxin assay, blood and urine cultures were sent.  C. diff
toxin + (though did have recent infection). All other culture
data remained negative and foot ulcers did not appear infected.
Foot ulcers were debrided by podiatry with wound care recs.
There was no evidence of osteomyelitis or deep tissue infection
per podiatry and no antibiotics were recommended for the
patient's foot ulcers, Vanc/ceftaz were d/cd and flagyl was
continued. His insulin regimen was titrated [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
recommendations.

2. Altered mental status - per report of health care proxy,
patient complained of "not feeling well" 2 days prior to
admission, and gradually developed an altered mental status. He
was then found altered with 100/200 of his monthly prescription
of oxycodone gone, though his prescription was for 20mg every 2
hours, though his tox screen in our ED was negative but does not
detect all forms of opiates. In the emergency [**Apartment Address(1) **] 100mcg
patches of fentanyl were removed, which was the dose he was on
at the time he was discharged from rehab.  His mental status
improved in the ICU, but prior to transfer to the floor, patient
was noted to be agitated and complain of nausea, which was
thought to be secondary to potential narcotic withdrawal. He was
reintiated on 200mcg of fentanyl and the next day his mental
status had improved.

3.  Leukocytosis - Patient had elevated WBC to 32K upon admit,
not febrile.  He had hx of recent hospital aquired MRSA
pneumonia, treated with vancomycin, cefepime, zosyn.  CXR upon
admit was negative for new or developing infiltrate.  He also
had recent history of CDiff, was treated with 14 day course of
IV flagyl.  Also had a history of foot ulcers, which appeared
infected upon admission, which prompted coverage for
polymicrobial etiology of diabetic ulcers; vanco for MRSA
coverage, Ceftaz/Flagyl for gram negatives, anaerobes, and C.
diff.  Cultures were pending at time of transfer to floor.
Cultures noteable for +C. diff and he was continued on flagyl.
Vanc and ceftaz were d/cd.  See section above regarding podiatry
evaluation and recommendations.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease - creatinine was at baseline upon
admission.

4. Chronic pain - Patient was on huge home doses of narcotics.
The patient was taken off all PRN opiate pain meds and he was
weabed down on his fentanyl patch.
The patient's fentanyl patch should be weaned off a
