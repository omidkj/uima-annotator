History of Present Illness:
55 year old male with known biscuspid
aortic valve and aortic stenosis who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**]
for new onset atrial fibrillation and chest pain [**2177-9-10**].  He
underwent TEE guided expedited cardioversion and discharged on
warfarin and no antiarrhythmic. Since discharge issues have been
coumadin management and he notes edema at the end of the day
with
improvement in the morning. He continues with chest pressure
with
activity that resolves with rest occuring a few times a week.
He
is now admitted for surgery and heparin bridge.

coffee daily. Works as an attorney. Lives at home and performs
all activities of daily living independently.

Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE [**2177-12-9**]

Pre CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Excessive motion of
anterior leaflet chordae tendineae noted, this could represent a
ruptured chord or redundant chordae length.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

Post CPB:
The patient is atrial paced.
The biventricular systolic function is preserved.
There is a mechanical valve in the aortic position with a peak
gradient of 34mmHg which is mechanically stable with good
leaflet excursion.
There is moderate mitral regurgitation with an eccentric
posteriorly directed regurgitation jet. The mitral valve
demonstrates systolic anterior motion. Sequential PWD through
the LVOT demonstrated step up of the peak velocity to 1.6m/s.
There is moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
The visible contours of the thoracic aorta are intact.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2177-12-9**]
where the patient underwent AVR(#23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical
valve)and a Septal Myomectomy .  Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Anticoagulation therapy was started with coumadin on [**2177-12-10**],
and Heparin intravenous therapy was started on [**2177-12-12**] until the
INR was >2.0.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  He did develop post-op a-fib and was
started on amiodarone.  The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD number 6, the patient
was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
home with visiting nurses in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1683**] will continue to manage
coumadin dosing.
