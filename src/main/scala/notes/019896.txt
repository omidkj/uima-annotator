History of Present Illness:
78 yo M w/ dCHF, diet controlled DM 2, HTN and h/o afib w/ RVR
presents from [**Hospital1 **] for admit of CP, SOB. Patient was diagnosed
with new onset atrial fibrillation in 12/[**2189**]. Esmalol drip and
loading dose of digoxin were tried at that time, but patient has
severe AS and developed hypotension. The patient was also put on
a heparin gtt and coumadin but had expanding hematomas and
symptomatic anemia so was discontinued. He was cardioverted and
discharged on metoprolol. Since then he has occasional
palpitations but these symptoms last 3-4 minutes and resolve w/
rest. One the day of presentation the patient again had
palpitations but they did not resolve. He also felt SOB and
chest pain. He presented to [**Hospital1 1774**], where he had Afib w/ RVR with
HR 130s, started on dilt drip at 15 mg/h (reportedly to 90s).
1st set trop neg <0.01.  Became chest pain free (did not get
nitro, critical AS). HR dropped to 40s but stabalized to 60s.
SBP dropped to 80s but stabalized to 100s.
.
Of note patient has also been complaining of fatigue for several
weeks and dark stools for 1 week. He was guiac negative in the
ED. No hematuria noted by patient.
.
In the ER, vitals were: 96.6 55 101/54 18 100. EKG showed afib
w/ RVR with RBBB but now in sinus brady w/ RBBB, no concerning
ST-T changes. CXR showed mild hilar fullness. His dilt gtt was
weaned down. Was also given ASA, plavis 300, and started on a
heparin gtt after repeat labs showed elevated cardiac enzymes.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. LVEF = 40%.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The annulus
measures 23 mm.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a small pericardial effusion.
8. Moderate bilaterl pleural effusions are seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusions of epinephrine and norepinephrine. AV
pacing. Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
Minimal AI. Gradient is now 22, 13 mean at CO = 5 L/min. LVEF is
now 45%, with inferior hypokinesis. MR is now trace. Aortic
contour is normal post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Final Report
INDICATION: 78-year-old man status post CABG, evaluate for
infiltrate.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2190-3-23**].

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Again noted is left lower lobe
opacification
with associated mild pleural effusion. Mild right lower lobe
opacification is
unchanged. Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged, unchanged.
The
mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.

IMPRESSION: Persistent opacification of the left lower lobe with
associated
mild effusion may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 78 year old male presents from with chest pain and
dyspnea.  Initially he had negative cardiac enzymes at another
institution, however, after a tachycardic episode, enzymes were
positive with no changes on EKG. He was referred for aortic
valve replacement and a catherization  showed significant three
vessel disease. He was continued on ASA 325, a statin and
Metoprolol. He was initially started on Plavix but this was
stopped once it was decided that he should have valve
replacement.

He has had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response.  He  was rate controlled with Metoprolol and
Amiodarone.

Preoperative workup included dental extractions and on [**3-19**]
he went to the Operationg Room where surgery was performed.  See
operative note for detasils.  He weaned from bypass on Propofol,
Levophed, Epinephrine and Vasopressin infusions.  He remained
stable, pressors were gradually weaned and he was extubated.
CTs and temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was
diuresed towards his preoperative weight and beta blockers
begun.

Physical Therapy saw him for strength and mobility. The
Lopressor was changed to Carvedilol for heart failure management
and Amlodipine and Lisinopril were given as well.  He was very
debilitated and, therefore, a stay at a rehabilitation facility
was recommended. His chronic Dox
