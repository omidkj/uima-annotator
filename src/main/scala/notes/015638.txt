Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath,hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 year old male with multiple myeloma
diagnosed in [**Month (only) 116**] s/p recent hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 17333**]) for a
T10 mass, treated with XRT on [**5-22**] and [**5-29**] and recent
chemotherapy who presents with one day of intermittent pleuritic
chest pain.  The pain began on [**2181-6-15**] when the patient was at
rest and was accompanied by shortness of breath.  The pain was
localized to the lower left chest near the costal margin.  He
thinks that the shortness of breath started first, followed by
the pain.  He denies any fevers or chills, but did have a cough
productive of clear sputum, which is new for him.  He then
experienced a 1 hour long pain-free period and delayed going to
the ED.  The pain returned today with increased intensity, and
he decided to call EMS.
.
In the ED, initial vitals in triage were: T 99.8, HR 106, BP
115/63, RR 20, and SpO2 100% on 10L NC.  He had already been
given a NS bolus in the ambulance for hypotension (to SBP 90)
and tachycardia (to 120).  He triggered for hypoxia (to 80% when
decreased to 4L NC), tachypnea, and tachycardia.  Exam showed no
evidence of peripheral edema or DVT.  He was placed on 100%
non-rebreather, satting 100%, and his tachycardia and tachypnea
resolved.
.
Differential diagnosis included pneumonia vs. PE vs. ACS.  After
taking blood and sputum cultures, empiric antibiotics for HCAP
were started with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Cefepime.  He
was given Aspirin 325 mg and placed on a Heparin gtt.  EKG
showed no acute ischemic changes, initial Troponin was negative,
and CXR showed chronic interstitial opacities with no evidence
of superimposed pneumonia.  Labs were notable for D-dimer [**Numeric Identifier **],
proBNP 1484, bicarb 19, lactate 1.7, and platelets 71.
.
There was significant concern for PE given his cancer history
and presentation.  No evidence of DVT was seen on physical exam.
 CTA was not performed due to increased risk of contrast
nephropathy in patients with active multiple myeloma.  A heparin
drip was started empirically for possible PE.  He was admitted
to the ICU for further management and inpatient V/Q scan.
.
On reaching the ICU, he reported feeling somewhat better.  His
chest pain had resolved and his breathing was less labored, but
still significantly worse than his baseline.  He reported that
he does not use any oxygen or inhalers at home.  He is not aware
of having lung disease, despite ILD noted in medical history and
on CXR.  He has never experienced a similar episode before.  He
notes that he was staying in bed most of the time since
completing chemotherapy a few weeks ago.  He has not had any
fevers or chills.  He is not aware of any recent sick contacts.

IMAGING
[**6-18**] CTA
PULMONARY ARTERIES: The main pulmonary artery proximal to the
bifurcation
measures 3.5 mm and is dilated. There is a large filling defect
in the right main, lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries of the
right lower lobe
suggestive of a massive pulmonary artery embolism. On the left
side pulmonary emboli are in the segmental pulmonary arteries of
the left lower lobe, however, the left main pulmonary artery is
devoid of any filling defects. However, there is no evidence of
any septal bulge or cardiac strain. There is minimal left
pleural effusion and adjacent basal atelectasis. Bilateral lungs
showing moderate-to-severe emphysema changes with diffuse
subpleural interstitial thickening and fibrosis, which is lower
lobe prominence. Diffuse heterogeneity of the lungs is
attributed to the air trapping. The features are suggestive of
emphysema with chronic interstitial lung disease.

Mediastinum: Imaged thyroid gland is normal. There are multiple
enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes at all stations, for example, the right
upper
paratracheal lymph node measures 1.6 x 1.4 cm. No pathologic
enlargement of supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes. There
is mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly without pericardial effusion. Calcification in the
coronary
arteries and the aortic arch is mild-to-moderate .

ABDOMEN: Study is not tailored for evaluation of the abdomen;
however,
limited views revealed non-calcified plaque measuring 1.7 x 0.9
cm in the
abdominal aorta (3:75) along the posterior wall causing less
than 50%
narrowing of the aortic lumen. Limited views of liver, spleen,
both kidneys and pancreas are unremarkable.

BONES: Bones are of diffusely low density with multiple small
osteolyt
