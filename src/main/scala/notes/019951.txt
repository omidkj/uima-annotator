Final Report
MEDICAL HISTORY: 83-year-old man status post AVR, with postop
AF, now status
post right upper extremity embolectomy for ischemic arm, rule
out DVT.

FINDINGS: On the left, the internal jugular vein compresses
completely and
demonstrates a normal venous waveform within it, with
respiratory variation.
The left subclavian vein, axillary vein, both brachial veins
compress
completely and augment well. The left cephalic vein demonstrates
flow within
it. The left basilic vein compresses completely and demonstrates
flow within
it on color Doppler imaging. Left cephalic vein compresses
completely.

On the right, the internal jugular vein compresses completely,
and
demonstrates normal venous waveform within it. The right
subclavian vein,
axillary vein, and both brachial veins compress completely and
augment well.
The right basilic vein does not compress completely and contains
echogenic
thrombus within it. It is, however, not completely occluded as
some blood
flow is detected within it. The right cephalic vein compresses
completely and
demonstrates blood flow within it on color Doppler imaging. At
the site of
the surgical wound in the mid right upper extremity, a rounded
hypoechoic
lesion is seen to lie anterior to the brachial artery, which
measures 0.9 x
1.1 x 1 cm in diameter. This does not display flow within it,
and likely
represents a small pseudoaneurysm; however, a small hematoma is
also in the
differential. This hematoma is compressing one of the brachial
veins on the
right; however, this brachial vein remains patent with no
thrombus seen within
it currently.

CONCLUSION:
1. Partially thrombosed right basilic vein.
2. Likely small pseudoaneurysm or hematoma arising from the
brachial artery
at the site of the surgical wound. No blood flow is detected
within this.
This pseudoaneurysm or hematoma is compressing one of the
brachial veins on
the right; however, this vein is currently patent with no
thrombus within it.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2106-6-23**] to evaluate for atrial fibrillation. On
admission, patient already converted back to a normal sinus
rhythm. Cardiology was consulted with recommendations to start
Coumadin and Amiodarone. In addition, patient was hyperkalemic
and hyperglyemic and treated appropriately with diuretics and
regular insulin. On hospital day two, patient developed new
right arm pain with diminished pulses. [**Month/Day/Year **] surgery was
consulted and patient was emergently brought to the operating
room for right axillary subclavian embolectomy and right radial
artery embolectomy. For surgical details, please see operative
note. Following surgery, he was brought to the CVICU in stable
condition. He was maintained on intravenous Heparin and
transesophogeal echocardiogram was performed which showed no
evidence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage.
**Echocardiogram was notable for severe mobile aortic
atheroma.** He maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day one. Warfarin was resumed and
intravenous Heparin was continued until his INR became
therapeutic. Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 -
3.0. Rheumatology was also consulted during his stay for an
acute gout flare of his left knee. He concomitantly experienced
low grade fevers for which pan cultures were obtained.
Aspiration of his left knee was also performed along with
intraarticular injection of steroids. Patient tolerated the
procedure and there were no complications. Knee aspiration
confirmed gout and pan cultures remained negative. Over several
days, medical therapy was optimized and he was eventually
cleared for discharge to home with [**Month/Day/Year 269**] on POD# 8.

First blood draw on [**7-3**] with INR/K+/BUN/creat. Results to be
called to pt's son, Dr. [**Known lastname 32668**].
