ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Mitral valve regurgitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Renal failure.
2. Liver failure.
3. Sepsis.
4. Death.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old man
with a history of atrial fibrillation, severe mitral
regurgitation presenting with dyspnea and worsening cardiac
failure.  He is undergoing mitral valve repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Atrial fibrillation.
2. Severe mitral regurgitation.
3. Bilateral lower extremity edema.
4. History of a left lower extremity DVT (20 years ago).
5. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
6. Dyspnea.
7. Hypercholesterolemia.
8. Former smoker.
9. Status post right inguinal herniorrhaphy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2123-11-26**], the patient was taken to the
operating room and underwent mitral valve repair with a #32
[**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.  The patient was sent back to the CSRU on
Levophed, milrinone, and vasopressin.  He had postoperative
bleeding and was transfused appropriately perioperatively.

Over the next few days, the patient weaned from his
vasopressors gradually and diuresed appropriately.  Patient
was transfused for low hematocrit.  The patient demonstrated
some jaundice and showed elevated LFTs.  This was thought to
be due to a low flow state.  Patient had decreased mental
status and underwent head CT on [**2123-12-1**].

Head CT and repeat head CT next morning was openly
unconclusive.  Aggressive diuresis and weaning from pressors
were performed.  ERCP on [**2123-12-9**] demonstrated no biliary
blockage.  Patient was bronched on [**2123-12-11**] for respiratory
distress.  Patient began spiking temperatures later on
[**2123-12-11**] and all lines were changed over wire and sent for
culture.  Patient was anticoagulated for his atrial
fibrillation.

On [**2123-12-16**], the patient began having increased bloody
secretions from the ET tube.  Trache and PEG were performed
on [**2123-12-17**].  Patient went into renal failure and had a
dialysis catheter placed on [**2123-12-19**].  Dialysis was begun on
[**12-20**] with CVVHD.

Patient became increasingly septic possibly from G tube
placement on [**2123-12-21**].  Patient was begun on Xigris for
evolving sepsis.  Subsequent to the Xigris and Heparin drips,
patient began having a severe GI bleed.  Patient had a
10-point hematocrit drop within 24 hours.  CT of the abdomen
was negative on [**2123-12-26**].  Melenic stools continued for the
next several days.  Patient had an elevated bilirubin and
confirmed Torulopsis fungemia.  He was placed on AmBisome and
broad-spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin, cefepime,
and Flagyl.

From the beginning of [**Month (only) 956**] to his eventual death, the
patient had fairly unchanged postoperative course.  He had a
continued bilirubin above 30, was depending on CVVH for fluid
balance, and remained on combination of Levophed and
intermittent vasopressin for blood pressure support.
Attempts were made to clear the blood from his GI tract
including GoLYTELY, Narcan, and tube feeds.  TPN was
intermittently attempted, but stopped secondary to liver
failure as well as ongoing fungemia.  Tube feeds were
attempted to be escalated to goal, but had to be held
secondary to esophageal reflux presenting itself as tube feed
leaking around the trache site.

On[**2124-1-16**], the patient in the early morning began
developing resumption of melenic stools.  In the afternoon of
[**2124-1-16**], the patient had a pronounced lower GI bleed with
between 2-3 liters of melenic stools.  The family was
consulted, and the attending physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was
informed of the grave nature of the patient's condition.
After careful deliberation and discussion, care was withdrawn
from the patient in the afternoon of [**2124-1-16**].  He expired
shortly thereafter.

Of note, on [**2123-12-14**], the patient did undergo exploratory
laparotomy and abdominal washout.
