57M with h/o ulcerative colitis on enterocort and mesalamine who
presents with a productive cough, chills, sore throat x 6 days.
Tmax 104 on Saturday. Also notes lightheadedness and decreased
PO intake, +HA. Denies CP/SOB/ N/V/abd pain/diarrhea/dysuria.
Exam: no tonsilar exudates, no sinus tenderness, mm dry, lungs
clear, no abd tenderness, no LE edema.
He was recently admittied in [**2159-11-2**] with abdominal
distention, decreased ostomy output, and found to have active
inflammation of the last 20 cm of his ileum. The patient
improved in the hospital with conservative measures including
n.p.o., IV fluids, IV Cipro, and Flagyl.  He was seen by the
surgery servicewith no indication for surgical management.  He
saw GI initially in clinic on [**11-26**] in followup after his
hospitalization and was doing fairly well.  An ileoscopy with
biopsies was performed on [**11-28**], which demonstrated erythema,
congestion, and discrete areas of ulceration in the ileum with
biopsies showing mild active ileitis at 20 cm and 10 cm.  Based
on these findings and his symptoms, he was started Entocort 9 mg
a day.  At a follow up appt on [**2159-12-17**] he was feeling well and
his GI sx had improved. He reported drainage from his umbilicus
which was thought to be likely from the area of the subcutaneous
fistula. He was re-started on cipro and flagyl for the fistula
drainage

.
Upon arrival to the floor the patient is very confused. When I
ask him about his sx he says that he refers to a website and
trying to meet with the webmaster for the website. He also tells
me that his cough is like a football pass. When I ask him why he
is in the hospital he tells me that he is sick and he would like
to get better but then he tells me that he is here for "excise
tax".
He does not report any abdominal sx. His ostomy output is
unchanged.

MICU admission HPI:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] is a 57 year old male with a history of ulcerative
colitis with end ileostomy presenting for evaluation of feeling
"lousy."  Starting 1 week ago, he had fever, myalgias,
rhinorrhea, sneezing and nonproductive cough. This lasted for ~
3 days and then he slowly improved. Reported Tmax ~104 on
Saturday. He has had marked diminished po intake over the last
week. He reports stable/normal ileostomy output. He is very
thirsty. He presented to his PCP's office today to report
ongoing symptoms. He was bothered by lightheadedness and
headache. In the office, he was hypothermic, HR in 140s with
orthostatic symptoms. He was referred to the ED.
.
In the ED, VS: 99, 90/61, 116 16 96% RA. He had a normal renal
ultrasound and unremarkable chest x-ray. He was admitted to the
medical service for management of hyponatremia and acute renal
failure.  He was given 1 gram vancomycin and 2.25 mg Zosyn


Past Medical History:
Longstanding ulcerative colitis proctocolectomy and pouch anal
stenosis in [**2141**] with subsequentpouch resection and end
ileostomy due to a stricture in the mid pouch and a leak at the
top of the pouch.
B12 deficiency on IM vitamin B-12 injection
Depression treated with Effexor
Olecrenon Bursitis
liver function chronically elevated with an ALT of 84. This can
be related to autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease, or alcohol
intake.
History of spontaneous pneumothorax at age 18, treated with
chest tube
Right thumb tendon injury [**2141**].
Actinic keratoses/seborrheic keratosis

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
B12 deficiency, depression, olecranon bursitis, elevated ALT,
history of spontaneous pneumothorax at age 18, right thumb
tendon
injury in [**2141**], actinic keratoses, and seborrheic keratoses.
.
ULCERATIVE COLITIS HISTORY
1.  Diagnosed in [**2140**].
2.  Status post total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal
stenosis in [**2141**].
3.  Stricture in the mid pouch and a stricture or leak at the
top
of the pouch at the afferent loop.  Underwent resection of blind
loop and diverting ileostomy for this in [**2146**] and then a ventral
pouch resection and end ileostomy.
4.  [**2148**] recurrent presacral abscesses status post multiple
drainage procedures and occurrence of an intraperitoneal fistula
at the site of prior diverting ileostomy with take down of
fistula.  Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 10946**] note, "I should emphasize that
prior to this operation I had all of his prior pathology
reviewed, and although he had been labeled as having Crohn's
disease he in fact truly has ulcerative colitis".
Intraoperatively, there was no evidence of Crohn's.
5. [**2150**] presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea.  CT showed
thickening in the distal small bowel, treated with IV Cipro,
Flagyl followed by p.o.  Cipro, Flagyl and a small bowel
follow-through that was normal.  ANCA serologies reportedly
negative or diagnostically UC at thetime.
8. [**2156**] presented with a cutaneous fistula and found to be a
subcutaneous fistula rather than enterocutaneous fistula.
Underwent ileoscopy that showed a single ulcer in the distal
ileum at 10 cm from the stoma with biopsy consistent with
chronic
active enteritis and focal ulceration of granulation tissue.  No
