Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
Septic shock
Left lower lobe pneumonia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement in ED
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
72 year old NH resident who presented with increased shortness
of breath and fever.  Patient comes with almost no information.
Per report from the nurse who found him this a.m., his temp was
104, systolic 95, HR 101.  He was given NEBs and transported to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In ED, vitals were T 104.8, P 161, BP 107/68, RR 36, 92% on 6L
NC. His labs were notable for a lactate of 5.3.  Pt. met
criteria for septic shock with the source mostly likely
pneumonia given his CXR demonstrated a LLL PNA.  Blood and urine
cultures were sent, and he was given flagyl, vanco, and levaquin
for empiric broad spectrum coverage.

An ABG in the ED came back 7.03/75/210; he was intubated with
etomidate and succinylcholine.  He subsequently dropped his
pressures to 50s systolic and was started on levophed and
subsequently vasopressin.  CVP was 18.  Pt. was in the MICU for
a week and zosyn was started.  Pt. was extubated successfuly.
Pt. was called out from the MICU on [**10-20**] to the floor and was
being diuresed for fluid overload, along with continued
treatment for pneumonia.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
CXR ([**10-29**]): IMPRESSION: AP and lateral chest compared to earlier
on [**10-29**]: This study does not confirm the impression of
the bedside study that small nodules have developed in the
lungs. It does show persistent severe consolidation in the left
lower lobe due to partially resolved pneumonia. Heart is top
normal size, but there is no pulmonary edema or appreciable
right pleural effusion. Nasogastric tube passes into the upper
stomach. No pneumothorax
.
Swallow Study: profound oral defecits with silent aspiration
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.NPO at this time with consideration for PEG tube for
nutrition and medications.
2.Follow up with palliative care team re: above issues.
3.Strongly consider use of nocturnal enteral nutrition
while maintaining small amounts of po's. At this time, if
this is pursued, would still suggest pureed solids and
nectar thick liquids. Avoid taking larger bites of purees.
Provide oral suctioning as needed. Pt should remain upright
for all po's and for 30 minutes after po feedings.
.
CXR ([**10-28**]): NGT in acceptable position, improvement in LLL
pneumonia and CHF
.
Repeat CXR ([**10-24**]) after NGT adjustment - tube in antrum of
stomach
.
CXR ([**10-24**]): NG tube has migrated proximally to the distal
esophagus. Mild congestive failure, bilateral small pleural
effusions, left lower lobe consolidation are not significantly
changed. There is no pneumothorax. Central venous line from left
internal jugular vein approach is in stable position.

CXR:LLL infiltrate

C. diff toxin - negative
Urine ctx ([**10-14**] and [**10-16**]) - no growth
Blood ctx ([**10-14**] and [**10-16**])- no growth in either aerobic/anaerobic

RADIOLOGY:
[**10-14**] PORTABLE CHEST:  There is a new large left lower lobe
airspace consolidation that likely represents pneumonia.

CHEST US:  IMPRESSION: Trace bilateral pleural effusions and
lower lobe
consolidation/atelectasis. The pleural effusions are too small
for
thoracentesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old male with unknown medical history, who presented
with fever, elevated lactate, tachypnea, PNA on CXR, and
hypotension.

1) Septic Shock:  Met criteria based on lactate, fever,
tachypnea and hypotension with presumed source being his large
LLL PNA.  He was placed on sepsis protocol in the ED with 2
pressor requirement after intubation, and admitted to the MICU.
His lactate trended down with continued aggressive fluid
resuscitation and he was able to come off pressors after 2 days.
 He had a cortisol stimulation test on arrival to which he did
not appropriately stim; he was therefore placed on a course of
hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for 7 days.  Pt. was
successfully intubated on [**10-18**] and went to the floor on [**10-20**].

2) PNA:  He had a dense LLL consolidation on admission, and
received vanco, levaquin, and flagyl in the ED.  On arrival to
the MICU he was changed from flagyl to zosyn to provide broader
coverage given that he is a nursing home resident, and continued
on levaquin and vanco.  Levaquin was discontinued after his
urine legionella antigen was negative.  Vancomycin was
discontinued after sputum cultures failed to demonstrate any
gram positives.  He completed a 14 day course of zosyn in house.
 The resolution of his PNA on CXR lagged behind his clinical
improvement.  Pt. seemed to improve while he was on the floor,
but his xrays only moderately improved and pt. remained
tachypneic.  This may have also been due to fluid overload.

3) Volume status - Pt. had received over 22 liters during
aggressive resuscitation in the MICU.  When he came to the floor
he was diuresed.  CXRs showed gradual improvement, but pt.
continued to have some element of respiratory distress.

4) GI: Pt. had an episode of coffee ground emesis with guiac +
stool.  It was suspected that pt. had an UGI bleed, but given
his fragile state and respiratory compromise - discussion w/
