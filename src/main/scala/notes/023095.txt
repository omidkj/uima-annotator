History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 78 yo male with history of Coronary Artery Disease
(MI in past) who states that for the past 2-3 weeks he has noted
exertional angina requiring increased NTG SL use. For the past
few weeks he has been using SL NTG daily
when he would exert himself (wash the floor, run errands). On
the day PTA he had chest pain associated with diaphoresis and he
took 24 SL NTG to relief waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] chest discomfort -
prompting his to present to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital where he was started
on IV NTG and transferred to NEBH ICU. His CK peaked at 445, CK
MB 7.7 and Troponin went from 0.47 to 0.32. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.

Pertinent Results:
[**2138-9-19**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Coronary angiogrpahy in this right
dominant system demostrated three vessel disease. The LMCA was
heavily calcified with non-critical disease. The LAD was
calcified with moderate disease. The LCx had an ostial 99%
stenosis. The RCA was totally occluded proximally and filled via
left to right collaterals. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed
normal right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of
9mmHg and LVEDP of 17mmHg. There was mild pulmonary arterial
systolic hypertension with PASP of 30mmHg. The cardiac index was
preserved at 2.45 L/min/m2. The calculated Fick cardiac output
was 4.81 L/min. There was normal central arterial pressure with
a systolic of 119mmHg, diastolic of 39mmHg, and mean of 69mmHg.
3. There was no significant gradient accross the aortic valve
suggesting no appreciable aortic stenosis. 4. Left
ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation. The LVEF was
grossly normal with no regional wall motion abnormalities. 5.
Aortic fluoroscopy revealed a moderately calcified aortic arch.
[**2138-9-19**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA with no stenosis. Left ICA
stenosis <40%.
[**2138-9-19**] Vein mapping: Duplex evaluation performed of both lower
extremity venous systems. Right greater saphenous vein shows
patency with diameters of 0.24 to 0.46 and the left greater
saphenous vein, 0.21 to 0.61
[**2138-9-19**] Chest CT: 1. Pulmonary nodule (5-mm right) for which
chest CT followup is recommended at six months [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**]
guidelines. 2. Dense atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta and
coronary arteries.
[**2138-9-23**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate anterior and
antero-septal hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is mild mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. POST CPB:
1. Mildly improve global and focal LV systolci function. 2.
Mitral regurgitationis now mild. No other change

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cath. Cath revealed severe three vessel coronary artery
disease. He was appropriately work-up for bypass surgery which
also included carotid u/s, chest ct, echo and vein mapping. On
[**9-23**] he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please see operative note for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring. He was extubated.  He experienced
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, for which
he was placed on amiodarone and converted back to sinus rhythm.
His pressors were weaned and his chest tubes were removed.  He
was disoriented for the first couple of days post-operatively
and then cleared.  On post-operative day three his epicardial
wires were removed and he was transferred to the surgical step
down floor.  By post-operative day four he had progressed well
and was cleared for discharge to home by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
