Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness, inability to walk


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Lumbar puncture
- PICC placement (and subsequent removal)

History of Present Illness:
66 F with hx of HTN, HLD, CAD, and prior strokes, moved to MA
from WV a few days ago to get better health care evaluation. Per
daughter, about 1 week ago, pt was hospitalized for purported
1st time seizure (though pt has depakote Rx dated [**3-7**]). The
patient has poor memory of this and the daughter has limited
details. The daughter can only say that she was surpised that
the pt was discharged as she was continuing to have the
inability to walk, and this was a new phenomenon. The daughter
notes that when she first arrived in WV to pick up her mother
that she felt her speech was slurred and noted that she was
unable to sit up by herself. She also noticed right sided
weakness. Over the last few days, there appears to have been
modest recovery of her strength, however the daughter notes that
she still cannot walk. She was initally brought to an OSH
(?[**Location (un) 1468**]) where a NCHCT was done showing B/L hypodensities. She
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Upon further history taken from the patient's husband, he
reports that since the patient's prior stroke in [**2180**], the
patient has never been the same. She no longer cooked, made
coffee, took [**Last Name (un) 82736**], or did anything around the house. The
husband wondered if there may be a psychiatric component to her
symptoms. Approximately 2 Thursdays prior to admission, the
patient had episodes of full body shaking. She woke up in the
morning and said "I don't know what's happening", had glassy
eyes, and then had full body shaking. She was taken to
[**Hospital 82737**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital, where she was apparently shaking
for 3 hours. There was no tongue biting, but there was urinary
incontinence en route to the hospital. She was transferred to
Carilon [**Hospital 50692**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital in [**State 622**] and then
discharged home. Upon arrival back home, she was "worn out" and
would not walk into the house.

Past Medical History:
- prior right MCA stroke in [**2180**] (presented with left-sided
weakness and dysarthria)
- COPD/emphysema formerly on 2 L/min supplemental oxygen at home
- tobacco abuse
- duodenal AVMs and gastritis/peptic ulcer disease seen on EGD
in [**12/2183**]
- depression/anxiety
- reported iron deficiency anemia
- hypertension
- obstructive sleep apnea
- left internal carotid artery stenosis (60-79%) per ultrasound
[**10/2181**]
- ? Parkinonism
- ? CAD with ? MI

Social History:
Tobacco 3 ppd x 45 years, denies EtOH or illicit drug use. Pt
reports husband had been primary caretaker and dispensed her
meds.  Husband [**Name (NI) 68449**] [**Name (NI) 16471**] is healthcare proxy (lives in
[**Name (NI) 37452**]): ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 82738**]).  Very recently came from [**State 82739**] to [**Location (un) 5503**] to live with daughter.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal
affect. Oriented to person, place ([**Hospital 86**] Hosp, cannot name
exact), and date (says [**2185-5-3**] instead of [**5-1**]).  somewhat
inattentive, trouble with DOW backwards though able to complete
eventually.  Speech is fluent with normal comprehension and
repetition; naming intact. No dysarthria. [**Location (un) **] intact.  Some
right/left confusion (takes a few tries to touch right thumb to
left ear). No evidence of apraxia or attentional neglect (though
may have some mild visual and sensory neglect).

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 2 mm
bilaterally. Visual fields appear full to confrontation, though
pt is not fully cooperative with testing and may have a right
peripheral VF loss/neglect). Extraocular movements intact
bilaterally, no nystagmus. Sensation intact V1-V3 to LT.  Face
with mild L facial droop though movement full.  Hearing intact
to finger rub bilaterally.  Palate elevation symmetrical.
Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius normal bilaterally. Tongue
midline, movements intact

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone normal. No observed myoclonus or
tremor at baseline

Note: IP weakness may just be a product of her position in bed

Sensation: Decreased to pinprick and proprioception throughout.
No clear level with PP. (+) extinction to DSS. (+)

Coordination: finger-nose-finger slow and with tremor, but no
clear ataxia/dysmetria, heel to shin ataxic on right, Unable to

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
Bilateral LENIs ([**2185-5-18**]):
Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of the right common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained.
There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation without
evidence of DVT. Color flow is demonstrated to the peroneal and
posterior tibial veins of the calves bilaterally, without
evidence of thrombus.

ECG ([**2185-5-16**]):
Sinus rhythm at 108 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, no Q's,
no ST segment or T wave changes.

CXR AP ([**2185-5-17**]):
In comparison with the study of [**5-16**], there is little change.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains within normal limits
and there is no evidence of vascular congestion or acute
pneumonia. Central line and nasogastric tubes remain in place.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast ([**2185-5-13**]):
There is no axillary, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. The
airways are patent to the subsegmental level. There is coronary
artery and aortic calcification. There is no pulmonary nodule.
There is tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity in the lingula and right middle
lobe. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. The liver,
gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenals and kidneys are normal.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy. There is
extensive calcification of the abdominal aorta. The
intra-abdominal small and large bowel is normal. There is an NG
tube in the stomach. There is no free fluid or free air. There
is a Foley catheter in the bladder. The rectum and sigmoid are
normal. There is no inguinal or pelvic adenopathy. There is no
free fluid in the pelvis. There has been prior hysterectomy.
Small regions of low attenuation in the adnexa likely represent
ovaries, measuring 2.0 x 1.3 cm on the right and 1.4 x 0.9cm on
the left.  There is marked osteophyte formation in the thoracic
spine consistent with degenerative change. There is mild
anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.

MRI/MRA Brain ([**2185-5-9**]):
Of note, the images are severely degrades by motion artifact
grossly
decreasing the sensitivity for evaluation of details. There are
four new punctate infarcts within the inferior right cerebellar
hemisphere as indicated by high intensity on diffusion and low
intensity on ADC. There is new abnormal slow diffusion along the
medial right parieto- occipital lobe in a gyriform pattern with
corresponding low signal intensit
