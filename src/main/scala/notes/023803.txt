Allergies:
Haldol / Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 70 year old Male with history of liver transplant
in [**2139-11-9**] for HCV/HCC complicated by portal vein
thrombosis. The patient had recently been discharged on [**2141-2-23**]
after being admitted for 4 days for transaminitis with biopsy
revealing changes consistent with chronic Hep C but no evidence
for acute rejection.
.
The patient presented to the hospital with a week's history of
diffuse abdominal pain, found in the ED to be febrile to 101.3
with SBP in low 100s for which he was given IVF, Vanc, Levo,
Flagyl, and Decadron with transient drop in pressure to the
90's. A chest film at the time was revealing for multilobar
pneumonia. Given evidence for infection and hypotension, the
patient was admitted to the MICU for treatment of sepsis from
PNA complicated by ARF. The patient was maintained on a 100%
face mask initially and did not require intubation through his
course. He was initially maintained on broadspectrum antibiotics
including Zosyn and Vancomycin with eventual addition of
caspofungin and Azithromycin (for consideration of Legionella)
as per ID's recommendation. As the patient's white count was
noted to be dropping, Vanc and Zosyn (both may have this effect)
was changed to Meropenem and Azthromycin without caspofungin,
the regimen which the patient is currently on upon transfer to
the floor. The patient is still currently taking Bactrim for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **]. Induced sputum was sent for a variety of studies including
legionella, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], fungal infection all of which were
negative. Bacterial cultures were unfortunately limiting as all
were contaminated with OP flora. The patient was treated with
the antibiotic regimens as detailed above and was additionally
diuresed for question of pulmonary edema as exacerbating factor.
With these treatments the patient has clinically improved
greatly, currently breathing comfortably on 3L NC. The patient
is now transferred to the medicine service for ongoing care.

Imaging:
[**2141-3-10**]: Portable Chest - The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
and hilar contours are normal.  Patchy opacities are noted
within the right middle lobe, obscuring the right cardiac border
and within the left upper lobe.  These may represent foci of
aspiration versus multifocal pneumonia.  There is no evidence of
congestive failure.  No definite pleural effusion.  No
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  Aspiration versus multifocal pneumonia as
described.
.
3-04-06L Duplex Doppler Abd/Pelvis - The liver is normal in
echotexture and architecture, without focal lesions. No
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is seen.  The main,
right, and left portal veins are patent, with normal hepatopetal
flow.  The left, middle, and right hepatic veins are also
patent, with normal direction of flow; there is exaggerated
respiratory variation due to the patient's snoring.  Main,
right,
and left hepatic arteries are also patent, with
