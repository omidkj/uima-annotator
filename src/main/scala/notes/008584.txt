Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, hypoxia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 50 yo female with PMHx sig. with HTN, ESRD on HD,
sarcoidosis, pulmonary HTN, HIT, and epilepsy who presents with
hypotension and tachypnea. Patient woke up this morning and felt
fine. She did slightly stumble on her way down the stairs to go
to HD but did not fall. Her husband drove her to HD. From
getting out of the car to walking into the [**Hospital **] clinic, she became
short of breath. Her VS there included T97, SBP 85. She reported
feeling dizzy and fatigued in addition to her SOB. She did not
get HD. She denies any confusion, LOC, vision changes, CP,
palpitations, cough, recent URI symptoms, orthopnea, N/V,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, blood in the stool,
melena. She has not had pedal edema in the last couple of weeks.
She denies any changes in weight.

She is on 3L NC at home. Yesterday she had a new HD catheter
placed in the LIJ; the RIJ was pulled. Pt reported a low grade
temp of 100.3 last night. Otherwise, she has been afebrile.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.7 87 92/61 22 99. Pt has been
afebrile in the ED. Pt received 1 L NS. BP remained in 80s/50s
with HR in 80s-90s. CXR was unremarkable. Renal was consulted.
Pt received kayexlate, insulin, and bicarb for hyperkalemia.
Zosyn and vanc for unknown infection. Pt was placed on levophed
at 31.5. Current VS are: 97.6, 89, 101/62, 32, 97% on NRB.

Chest x-ray [**2185-4-28**]:
No significant interval change when compared to the previous
study with chronic interstitial parenchymal opacities compatible
with the patient's underlying sarcoidosis. No evidence of
pneumothorax.

CT chest [**2185-4-28**]:
1. Slight worsening of extensive interstitial opacities which
may be due to differing phase of respiration during scanning,
although mild superimposed interstitial edema on chronic
interstitial disease cannot be excluded. No focal consolidation
identified. Correlate clinically. Follow up chest x-ray may be
beneficial if diuresed.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Hemodialysis catheter is seen terminating within the right
atrium.

Chest x-ray [**2185-4-29**]:
No acute change. Diffuse interstitial opacities involving the
middle and upper lungs bilaterally are stable in appearance. No
new opacity. Stable prominence of the cardiac silhouette with
dual-lumen catheter in place.

C.diff [**2185-4-30**]: Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by
EIA.
.
.
CTA Chest [**2185-5-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism or aortic
dissection.
2. Long tubular filling defect noted extending from distal right
subclavian vein, through right brachiocephalic vein, into the
superior vena cava is compatible with thrombus, probably related
to prior hemodialysis catheter placed on right side.
3. Focal area of worsening of the pre-existing extensive
interstitial lung
disease suggest superimposed acute inflammatory/infection
process.
4. Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.
5. Interval resolution of the right pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 50 year old female with past medical history
significant for HTN, ESRD on HD, sarcoidosis, pulmonary HTN,
HIT, and epilepsy who presented with hypotension and hypoxia.

#. Hypotension: The patient initially required Levophed to
maintain SBP 95-105, however did not become symptomatic aside
from some lightheadedness prior to admission. The patient
reported that her usual BP at home was 160-180/90-110. This was
felt to be most likely secondary to sepsis. The pt had mild
tenderness at both line sites (right HD line had been removed on
[**2185-4-27**] and re-sited to left) but denied any significant
drainage. The patient spiked a fever to 102.9 and received blood
cultures from peripheral vein and CVC. Blood cultures never grew
an organism, including 1 set from the pt's new HD line. She was
weaned from pressors and restarted on home Sildenafil. She was
started on antibiotics to cover health-care associated
infections with Vanc and Zosyn. ECHO on [**2185-4-29**] was negative for
vegetations, but did show mild global systolic dysfunction and
severe pulmonary hypertension. On [**2185-4-29**], the patient became
tachypneic and hypoxic at dialysis, had an ABG of 7.56/36/98 and
was transferred back to MICU. This resolved and she was called
out to the floor on [**2185-4-30**]. The pt completed a 10 day course of
vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for presumed line infection (from
the dialysis catheter that had been removed on [**2185-4-27**]).
.
# Hypoxia: On the floor the pt was noted to have increased
oxygen requirements when compared to her home oxygen needs
(oxygen for climbing stairs, other exertional activities), and
it was unclear if this was related to worsening of sarcoid (DLCO
lower in [**4-4**]) versus an acute process. CXR did not show
evidence of pna. The pt had a CT-A which did not show PE, but
did reveal a long tubular filling defect noted extending from
distal right subclavian vein, through right brachiocephalic
vein, into the superior vena cava which was compatible with
thrombus, probably related to prior hemodialysis catheter placed
on right side. The pt was then started on argatroban (given
history of HIT) and coumadin. The pt was discharged on coumadin
with plans to have her INR followed through the [**Company 191**] coumadin
clinic. On discharge the pt was noted to be off oxygen and
breathing comfortably on room air.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: The patient received insulin, bicarb, and
kayexylate. A hemolyzed specimen measured 6.8, however her K was
then measured at 5.5. Her ECG did not show any significant
changes, and her potassium corrected with dialysis the following
day.
.
#. ESRD on HD: The patient was followed by the nephrology
service during this admission and dialyzed on her regular
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule.
.
#. Pulmonary HTN: Her Sildenafil was initially held due to
hypotension however this was restarted on [**2185-4-29**]. When the pt
was noted to have persistent hypoxia, a pulmonary consult was
requested and the pt's outpatient pulmonologist recommended that
Sildenafil be stopped as
