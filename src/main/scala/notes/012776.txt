Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest tightness, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-4-4**] - CABGx3 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM, SVG->RCA)
[**2169-3-30**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of vascular
disease thought to be secondary to mantle radiation therapy to
the chest in [**2129**] for Hodgkin's disease, CAD s/p PTCA of LCx in
[**4-17**], bilateral subclavian stenosis s/p stents, left carotid
endarterectomy who presented with a 1 day history of chest
tightness and weakness while exercising.
The patient reported that he was exercising at the gym on the
day of admission, and reported doing a little more strenuous
exercise than usual. He began to feel more weak with a little
chest tightness, slight SOB, nausea, palpitations, neck
tightness, and right arm numbness. He denied diaphoresis and
dizziness. He reported that he has had more fatigue with
exertion, especially when walking uphill, over the past few
months.  Of note these symptoms are similar to described anginal
symptoms for which he had a cardiac catheterization in [**2162**]. The
patient then went home. His symptoms persisted, so he had his
brother take him to the hospital. He does report taking his ASA
325 mg over the past 7 days. He did not take any nitro at home.
In the ED he was chest pain free with an EKG that was v-paced.
CEs showed TropT to 0.16, CK 253. CXR showed no evidence of
pneumonia or CHF.

Findings
Pt is AV paced at a rate of 85
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.
All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size. Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction. TSI demonstrates
significant LV dyssynchrony with significant septal wall
contraction delay (vs. lateral wall).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AS. Mild to moderate ([**11-16**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be A-V paced. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE CPB:
1. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Dopple
