This is an addendum from [**2179-4-26**] through [**2179-5-15**].

ADDENDUM:  During these three weeks Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] remained in
the Medical Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course was
complicated by a few issue.

1. Fevers:  Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] continued to have fevers, which
   initially were of unknown origin.  At the same time he was
   discovered to have a retroperitoneal bleed, which was
   thought to be possibly responsible for the fevers.  Chest
   x-ray was unremarkable.  Blood cultures revealed 1 out of
   4 bottles on one day only with Enterococcus __________,
   which was Vancomycin resistant.  As a result he was
   started on Linezolid with resolution of the fevers.  Given
   the quick resolution of the fevers it was thought that
   this was most likely a line infection or incidental
   contamination, which happened to occur at the same time
   that the patient was experiencing fevers caused by a
   different etiology.  Given his previous history of VRE
   bacteremia and the possibility that he has complex
   atheromas on his aortic arch, which could have vegetations
   on them it was decided to treat him for two weeks with
   Linezolid starting from [**2179-5-7**].  Urinalysis revealed
   yeast infection with more then 100,000 colonies.  This
   issue was discussed with the infectious disease team who
   felt that treatment at this time while the patient was on
   antibiotics and at the same time also had a Foley in place
   would have been useless.  It was therefore decided not to
   treat him until the Foley could be discontinued and all
   antibiotics would be stopped. The fungal urinary tract
   infection was not thought to be responsible for the
   fevers.

1. Retroperitoneal bleed:  Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] developed a
   retroperitoneal bleed while on Coumadin with elevated INR
   up to 4.6.  His hematocrit dropped to approximately 25 and
   he required several blood transfusions in order to keep it
   above 28, which was the target that the team had
   established given his prior history of coronary artery
   disease.  A CT of the abdomen and groin was obtained,
   which revealed retroperitoneal bleed extended also in the
   anterior aspect of the right thigh and layered.  Therefore
   representing two kinds of blood one side and the other one
   still liquid suggesting a chronic rather then acute bleed.
   The vascular surgery team was consulted and they
   recommended to intervene on this hematoma.  The INR was
   reversed with fresh frozen platelets and Coumadin and the
   hematoma has been resolving slowly since.

1. Anticoagulation:  The patient required anticoagulation for
   history of HIT, which happened during this
   hospitalization, but prior to [**4-26**] as stated above the
   patient became supratherapeutic and developed a
   retroperitoneal bleed.  However, once the retroperitoneal
   bleed stabilized and his INR level came down to 1.5 low
   dose Coumadin was restarted and eventually increased again
   to 7.5 mg po q.d.  After only one day of Coumadin 7.5 mg
   po q.d. an INR of 1.5.  The target INR is 2.0 to 2.5.

1. Mental status change:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] mental status waxed
   and waned during this three weeks.  At his best he was
   able to follow commands, which included sticking out his
   tongue, opening and closing his eyes, nodding and
   shrugging the right shoulder.  However, as increased
   sedation was required to address his tachypnea, which
   appeared to be secondary to discomfort, Mr. [**Known lastname 496**]
   became more drowsy and unable to follow commands.  A head
   CT was obtained, which revealed no acute pathology
   including no intracranial bleed or embolic stroke.  The
   neurology team was reconsulted and they recommended five
   sessions of plasmapheresis.  Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] at this time
   has received three sessions of plasmapheresis, which occur
   three times a week.  So far there has been no noticeable
   improvement in his mental status.

1. Ventilation:  Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] is currently trached
   throughout these past three weeks.  He usually tolerated
   pressure support of 15 to 10 with a PEEP of 5, however,
   occasionally without any clear trigger he has had episodes
   of tachypnea up to the 40s and tachycardia.  At this time
   his tidal volumes drop, but his oxygenation remained
   stable around 99 to 100 percent on an FIO2 of 35 percent.
   Occasionally this improved with switching him to AC,
   however, once switched on AC sometimes he would continue
   to over breath the vent maintaining a respiratory rate of
   around 35 to 40.  Several chest x-rays were obtained
   during these episodes and consistently revealed clear
   lungs.  He never dropped his oxygenation and his chest x-
   rays were clear and his examinations revealed good breath
   sounds throughout.  It was thought to be most likely
   neurological possibly secondary to pain or anxiety and it
   was addressed by providing him with constant sedation.
   The constant sedation decreased his events of tachypnea
   and tachycardia, however, as listed above decreased his
   mental status.

1. Fen:  Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] continues to receive tube feeds, which
   are currently at goal.  He appears euvolemic and his
   electrolytes are usually stable, though he occasionally
   requires potassium replacement.  His code status remains
   full and on [**2179-5-15**] Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] remains stable in the
   Medical Intensive Care Unit.
