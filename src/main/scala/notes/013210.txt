admission Hct was 25.5, he was noted to have bright red blood
per rectum (admitted today [**7-8**]) and was initially
hemodynamically stable. His hemodynamics worsened and he had
increased BRBPR. Hct nadir was 22, and he got 3 units of PRBC, 1
units FFP, 1 unit of Plt at [**Hospital1 18**] and in [**Location (un) **]. EGD at
[**Location (un) 620**] revealed AVM's, esophageal/gastric varices with
esophageal varices being injected with epinephrine. Copious

IMAGING:
CXR [**7-8**]:
The [**Last Name (un) **] device is in place.  The tip of the device is not
visualized.  There is an endotracheal tube with its tip
projecting
approximately 7 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular
venous
introduction sheath and right internal jugular [**Last Name (un) 5703**] catheter is
in situ.
Moderate parenchymal opacity in the left perihilar lung areas.
Mild
atelectasis at the left lung base.  Minimal atelectasis at the
right lung
base, otherwise unremarkable right lung.  Borderline size of the
cardiac
silhouette.  Left pectoral pacemaker with correct position of
the wires.

ABD u/s DOPP [**7-9**]:
1.  Multiple right and left lobe hepatic masses consistent with
metastatic
