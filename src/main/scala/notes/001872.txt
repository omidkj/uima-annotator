IDENTIFICATION:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] is now day of life
number 11 ex 37 and [**5-15**] week male who was admitted to the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 188**] secondary to respiratory distress and rule out sepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] is now
day of life number 11 ex 37 and [**5-15**] week infant who was
admitted on [**2119-6-18**] secondary to respiratory distress
and rule out sepsis.  The baby was delivered via [**Name (NI) 48346**] under
epidural anesthesia to a 28 G1 P0 now 1 mother with a past
medical history, which was notable for glomerulonephropathy
with onset during pregnancy.  She had a high degree of
proteinuria during that time.  Her prenatal screens were
significant for blood type O positive, antibody screen
negative, HBSAG negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune and
GBS unknown.  The mother's estimated date of delivery was
[**2119-7-5**] for an estimated gestational age at the time of
delivery at 37 and 4/7 weeks.  Mom's pregnancy as noted above
was complicated by nephropathy.  Betamethasone was
administered on [**2119-5-15**] in case preterm delivery was necessary
secondary to the maternal glomerulonephropathy.  Rupture of
membranes occurred naturally and was 16 hours prior to
delivery yielding a clear amniotic fluid.  There was no
history of maternal fever or fetal tachycardia.  No
antepartum antibiotics were administered.  The infant
proceeded to spontaneous vaginal delivery under epidural
anesthesia.  The neonatal Intensive Care Unit was not in
attendance at the time of delivery.  The infant received bulb
suctioning and tactile stimulation and then was given blow by
oxygen.  Respiratory distress was noted through approximately
30 minutes of age leading to transfer to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and then eventual
admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Birth weight 2485 grams,

genitalia with testes descended bilaterally.  Anus patent.
Central nervous system active, alert, responsive to
stimulation.  Tone appropriate.  Moving all limbs
symmetrically.  Suck, root, gag, grasp reflexes normal.
Extremities normal spine, limbs, clicks and clavicles.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**]
[**Known lastname 48345**] was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition in terms of his cardiovascular status.  He
had no episodes of hypotension nor hypertension.  Baby boy
[**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] did have several episodes of what appeared
to be apnea with oxygen desaturation noted subsequent to
extubation after being treated for surfactant deficiency.
However, during these events he was not noted to be
bradycardic.  Since his respiratory distress has resolved he
has had no episodes of cardiovascular instability and is
discharged to home without any concerns in terms of his
cardiovascular status.

2.  Respiratory:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] was admitted in
respiratory distress with grunting, flaring, retracting.  His
grunting, flaring, retracting increased such that he was
started on nasal CPAP originally at 5 cm of water with an
FIO2 starting at approximately 40% FIO2.  His respiratory
rates were noted to be 60s to 80s during that time.  He
remained on mobile CPAP until approximately midnight on the
night of [**6-18**] where upon his respiratory
distress increased and he was intubated and given surfactant
in the early hours of the morning of [**2119-6-19**].  His
initial settings were 20/5 with a rate of 25.  He had a good
capillary gas at that time.  The settings were weaned and he
was given a second treatment of surfactant on the morning of
[**2119-6-19**].  His vent continued to be weaned and he was in
room air.  He was extubated approximately 3:00 p.m. on [**6-19**]
and was placed on nasal cannula oxygen at approximately 400
cc per minute flow.  His original FIO2 was about .4, however,
over the course of the next several days his FIO2 increased
to approximately .7 to 1.0 with 1.0 being needed during cares
and feedings.  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] remained on nasal
cannula oxygen for an extended period of time meet needing
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula until approximately the
evening of [**6-25**].  Initially baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**]
required continuing 400 cc at near 1.0 FIO2 until
approximately [**6-23**] to [**6-24**] when his flow was weaned to low
flow at approximately 13 to 50 cc per minute at 1.0 and
eventually came off on [**2119-6-25**].  Subsequent to his being
weaned off of his nasal cannula baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] has
been in room air without any difficulties and has had no need
for supplemental oxygen.

Subsequent to extubation baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] had
several episodes of apnea or shallow breathing with oxygen
desaturation, which was not accompanied by bradycardia.  At
least one of his episodes occurred while he was being held by
his parents.  He did, however, not have any more episodes of
apnea/shallow breathing or oxygen desaturation from the point
of Saturday afternoon [**6-24**] until the time of his discharge,
which constitutes five days without any episodes of oxygen
desaturations or altered breathing pattern.  He was not
treated with any methylxanthine for stimulation of his
respiratory center.

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**]
[**Known lastname 48345**] was admitted in respiratory distress and was made
NPO.  He was started on oral feedings subsequent to
extubation and started feeding on [**6-19**] to [**2119-6-20**].  He did
not feed well, however, po secondary to his degree of
respiratory distress during feeds and thus was fed both po
and pg during the first several days of his enteral feeds.
However, his feeding behavior improved such that by the
weekend of [**2119-6-23**] he was on solely oral feeds without need
for gastric tube feedings and was taking very good volumes of
oral feeds.  For example on the day prior to discharge baby
boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] took 160 cc per kilo per day of breast
milk or Enfamil 20 with iron.  During his hospitalization
baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] had no difficulties with
electrolyte instabilities nor with urine output or stooling.
He is thus discharged to home without any concerns regarding
his fluids, electrolytes or nutrition.

4.  Hematologic and infections diseases:  Upon admission baby
boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] was started on antibiotics secondary to
his respiratory distress in the setting of a mother whose GBS
status was unknown.  He was placed on Ampicillin and
Gentamycin and a blood culture was collected as well as a
CBC.  CBC was benign and the blood culture remained no growth
to date after 48 hours and antibiotics were discontinued at
that time.  Secondary to his
