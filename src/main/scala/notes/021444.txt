History of Present Illness:
60 yo woman with multiple medical problems as noted below who
initially presented [**5-15**] with 1-2 days of cough, wheezing,
"whole body spasm," confusion, and lethargy.  In the ED, she was
found to have 22% bandemia and soon developed  hypotension (SBP
in the 60s) that did not respond to IV fluids.  She was started
on dopamine and transferred to the ICU.  Given an initial ABG of
7.27/72/71 on 3L oxygen by nasal cannula, NIPPV was attempted
but not tolerated, so the patient was intubated.

There was a question of seizure activity on [**5-19**], at which point
she was loaded with IV phenytoin.  Following a second episode of
fast coarse tremors, the patient was again loaded with IV
phenytoin [**5-24**]; she has been maintained on this medication since.
 Further, out of concern for possible Baclofen withdrawal, she
was restarted on this medication on [**5-25**] with good effect
(reduction in tremors).


Past Medical History:
1.  MRSA bacteremia [**11-24**] ultimately complicated by T6-7
osteomyelitis and discitis [**5-26**] s/p T6-7 laminectomies and
transpedicular decompression of T6, complicated by paraplegia
2. stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer [**8-26**] with associated
osteomyelitis necessitating diverting colostomy [**11-25**] that was
re-sited [**12-27**]
3.  coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction
4.  hypertension
5.  COPD (on home oxygen)
6. ESBL Klebsiella urinary tract infection c/b sepsis

** Admit CXR:
1. Interval placement of an ET tube, with the tip positioned two
centimeters above the carina. Interval placement of a central
venous catheter with the tip positioned in the mid SVC. No
pneumothorax.
2. Prominence of pulmonary vasculature and central hilar
vascular engorgement suggests mild CHF.
3. Left base atelectasis and/or infiltrate.
.
** ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF
60%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
** Chest CTA:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Extensive patchy airspace opacities. Given the additional
findings of septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusions,
this likely represents congestive heart failure. Superimposed
infectious process is also possible.
.
** Head CT:
No intracranial hemorrhage or edema is evident. MRI is more
sensitive for assessment of subtle changes associated with
hyponatremia and acute infarction.
.
** EEG:
Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized
background and due to the bursts of generalized slowing. These
findings
indicate a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and

subcortical structures. Metabolic disturbances, medications, and

infection are among the most common causes. There were no areas
of
prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform
features.
.
** 24-hour EEG:
This is a discontinuous 24-hour bedside EEG from [**5-23**]
that was mildly abnormal due to a somewhat slowed background
rhythm in the upper theta and lower alpha frequency ranges. This
may reflect excessive drowsiness or possibly an early
encephalopathy. Common causes of encephalopathy include
infection, metabolic disturbances, and medication effect. No
lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were identified in
this recording and of significance, on two occasions, the
patient was noted to save tremor or shaking without
electrographic evidence of seizure.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo woman admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure due to
probable Pneumococcal +/- Klebsiella pneumonia and COPD
exacerbation with hospital course complicated by Klebsiella
urinary tract infection, probably seizures, and intermittent
hemodynamic instability.
.
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Her hypercapneic respiratory
failure was ultimately attributed to a combination of
Pneumococcal pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and congestive heart
failure. She was therefore treated with a course of antibiotics
(initially vancomycin (5 days followed by an additional 3 days
[**Date range (1) 47943**]) and levofloxacin (3 days), followed by
piperacillin/tazobactam (8 days), metronidazole (6 days), and
finally meropenem (day [**10-6**] today)), steroids, and nebulizers;
she was also gently diuresed as tolerated by her blood pressure.
She gradually improved, and on [**5-23**] she self-extubated. She
initially tolerated extubation on significant, non-invasive
ventilatory support, and her steroids were tapered to off on
[**5-25**]. She was ultimately reintubated for hypercapneic respiratory
failure (PaCO2 131) on [**5-27**], at which point stress-dose steroids
were restarted. She was successfully extubated [**5-28**] and was
transferred to the fl
