History of Present Illness:
54 yo M with ESRD HD-dependent, HTN, DM, who p/w hypotension and
bacteremia. Pt had N/V/D x6 days and decreased PO intake with
fevers of 102 at home. He went for regularly scheduled HD 1 day
PTA where his HD site was noted to be infected and cath had
reportedly fallen out the previous day. Blood cultures were
obtained and he continued his HD per NL protocol and was given 1
gm vancomycin empirically for the presumed infection. On the day
of admission, the pt was called to come to the ED b/c [**2-5**] BCx
noted to be growing out GNR--pt notified. On questioning in [**Name (NI) **],
pt denied abd pain, but did admit to back pain (chronic). CXR
showed large L pleural effusion with infiltrates.He received 3L
NS, vanc, and gent. Labs were notable for Tbili 12.8 (Dir 9.7),
lactate 7.4 (-->6.6-->5.8), and PLT 69. Several attempts were
made at central line placement, but given pt's agitation, this
was unsuccessful.  He was transferred to the floor, LSC was
attempted, but unsuccessful, so R femoral line was placed and pt
was electively intubated b/c of AMS and sats dropping to the
80s. Pt transferred to the MICU for further managment.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Please eval ET tube placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with ESRD on HD, DM, who p/w GNR bacteremia, LLL
Pna not intubated
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval ET tube placement
INDICATIONS: For assessment of ET tube placement.

PORTABLE AP CHEST: Comparison is made to the prior study from
same day and also [**2187-3-8**].

FINDINGS: There has been dramatic interval change when compared
to exam from [**3-8**]. The patient has a central cervical spine
fusion in situ. The patient is now intubated and the ET tube is
identified in good position with its tip 4 cm above the carina..
Evidence of extensive air space consolidation of the left side.
Silhouetting of the left heart border in the lingula, and also
some partial silhouetting of the left lower lobe.this has
progressed over the course of the day. In the right lung, there
is faint opacification in the right mid zone. The lungs appear
otherwise normal. The bones are unremarkable without evidence of
dystrophy.

IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive left sided air space consolidation. This likely
represents pneumonia. Other causes such as asymmetrical
pulmonary edema,particularly given it's rapid progression,
cannot be readily excluded, correlation with clinical history is
recommended.

2. Patient now intubated


Brief Hospital Course:
Breifly: This is a 54 yo man with DM and ESRD due to anti-GBM
disease who was admitted on [**9-19**] with ecoli sepsis and
pneumonia. He was intubated for respiratory failure, was unable
to be weaned off, and a tracheostomy was placed. He then
developed a necrotizing left lung pnemonia. He was stabalized
and transferred out of the ICU on [**10-8**] in good condition.

1) Bacteremia-- The patient presented with Ecoli pneumonia and
bacteremia thought to ne due to an infected HD line. The patient
was started on double coverage for gram nbegative rods with
zosyn, levoquin, and vancomycin to cover gram positive cocci.
On [**9-24**], the vanco and zosyn was stopped, as only etiology on
culture was GNR, and the patient was continued on flagyl and
levoquin for 21 day course.  Blood cultures negative from [**9-19**]
on.  On [**9-27**] he was diagnosed with a necrotizing pnemonia. Then
vanco and zosyn were restarted and the other were stopped.
Vancomycin was stopped prior to his leaving the unit. He will
need to coninue a total 4 week course of Zosyn, which will be
until [**10-22**].

2)Septic shock--The patient has a increased lactate and
hypotension on admission.  He was resuscitated with 6 L of IV
fluids then levophed was used to keep his MAP above 65.  A full
course of stress dose steriods was completed on [**9-25**].  He
remained normotensive or hypertensive off of pressors from [**9-22**]
on.

3)Respiratory failure: Elective intubation in the setting of
mental status change and decreasing O2 sats. However, the
patient has a large Left lobe pneumonia and L pleural effusion
contributing to hypoxemia. Thoracentesis was attempted, but not
the effusion was not tappable as it was all consolidated LLL.
CXR and Chest CT from [**9-21**] revealed nearly majority of left lung
with solid consolidation, no evidence of empyema.  His mental
status and ventilation improved and he was weaned until [**9-24**]
when developed increasing copious secretions, good cough but
decreased MS again. Over [**Date range (1) 103957**], he continued with increasing
secretions and worsening mental status, no longer with
successful weaning of ventilator despite CXRs with no interval
change (still with majority of lung solid consolidation). [**9-30**]
CXR with small ?cystic lesions in L upper lobe consolidation, CT
chest consistent with large confluent lucencies of left lung
likely secondary to necrosis and Right lung base patchy
infiltrates.  Bronch [**9-30**] with large amount of grey purulent
material from the left lung, BAL sent for fungal, bacterial,
viral, and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 103958**]; all were negative.  Pt had a
tracheostomy on [**9-30**]. He came off of the vent on [**10-7**] and has
been stable since. His O2 sats are 94 - 98 % on room air.
However, he needs assistance managining with secretions  -
humidified TM, [**Hospital1 **] chest PT, guanefisin, head of the bed above
45 degrees, and avoiding dehydration.

4)Thrombocytopenia: On admission, concerning for DIC in setting
of sepsis. However, with trending of DIC labs, pt never with
full manifestation of DIC and thrombocytopenia resolved with d/c
of zosyn.  When Zosyn was started again for pnemonia, the
patient did not have thrombocytopeina and in fact had a reactive
thrombocytosis from infection.

5) R IJ clot [**9-24**] discovered after unsuccessful line placement,
pt started on heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin. Hos
coumadin will need further titration in rehab.

6)ESRD [**2-5**] antiglomerular basement membrane disease: On HD since
[**3-8**] Q T/th/Sat. Pt required QD or QOD dialysis since admission,
which was helpful in maintaining patient's delicate fluid
balance in the setting of sepsis. Now he is getting M,W,F
dialysis during which at leadt 4 lbs is taken off. He gets
dialysis through his f
