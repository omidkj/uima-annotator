HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 67 year old
female who presented to an outside hospital with abdominal
pain, distention, nausea, for approximately three days.  Her
last bowel movement was approximately the day prior to her
admission which was in [**2170-2-10**].  She had had a history
of small bowel obstructions and had felt these symptoms in
previous episodes.  Of note, the patient had a history of a
gastric bypass performed several years ago as well as an
incarcerated hernia repair.  The patient was admitted to an
outside hospital and ultimately underwent an exploratory
laparotomy and repair of hernia and was being taken care of
at the outside hospital.  However, during her hospital course
there, she was found to have serous drainage from her wound
and was found to have developed a significant enterocutaneous
fistula.  Therefore, it was decided at the outside hospital
that she would be transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].

She also had a PICC line which was placed at the outside
hospital and was having wet to dry dressing changes to her
abdominal wound.  A G-J tube had been placed during her
operation at the outside hospital and those were kept on
intermittent suction.  She also had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain
which was also to bulb suction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to [**Hospital1 190**], the patient was afebrile and her vital signs
were stable.  She was an obese female in no apparent
distress.  She was saturating 98% on two liters nasal
cannula.  Her lungs had some mild crackles but were clear.
Her heart was regular.  Her abdomen was obese, nontender, and
she had an open enterocutaneous fistula times three and open
surgical wound on her belly with retention sutures in place
and Foley catheter was also in place.  Her extremities were
severely edematous which stated by her was her baseline.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's laboratories are all within
normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Blue
Surgery service and was continued on TPN for preoperative
nutritional enhancement and it was planned the patient would
ultimately undergo exploratory laparotomy and repair of the
enterocutaneous fistula. On [**2170-8-31**], the patient was taken t
the operating room for an attempted revision of her multiple
enterocutaneous fistulas.  The patient did well from the
operation, however, postoperatively she developed single
enterocutaneous fistula which caused wound breakdown and
again she was started on tube feeding as well as TPN for
nutritional enhancement.  The enterocutaneous fistula was not
able to be closed with just nutritional enhancement.
Therefore, it was decided that the patient would have to
return to the operating room on [**2170-9-13**], for a reexploration
and component separation and flap closure, split thickness
skin graft closure for this enterocutaneous fistula.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], the plastic surgery service, was consulted for this
workup and followed this patient along throughout her entire
hospital course.  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2170-9-13**], where closure of her enterocutaneous fistula was
done and split thickness skin graft was also performed as
well as a revision of her G-J tube.  Postoperatively, the
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for blood
pressure support and prolonged ventilatory support.  The
patient was slowly weaned from the ventilator
postoperatively, however, after extubation, she had
significant respiratory distress and required significant
fluid management.  Therefore, she was reintubated and
continued in the Intensive Care Unit.  Again, she required
prolonged pressor support for her blood pressure and fluid
management.  She slowly improved from a pulmonary standpoint
after the second intubation and she was able to be diuresed
gently from her fluid.  She was started on TPN and she was
successfully able to be weaned from the ventilator
postoperatively.  The patient also had episodes of
temperature spikes and was found to have gram positive cocci
in blood cultures as well as on line cultures.  Therefore,
she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.  She was
continued on multiple antibiotics and ultimately completed a
twenty-two day course of Zosyn for the positive blood
cultures and for her line sepsis.  She continued to improve
slowly in her Intensive Care Unit stay and her bowel function
slowly returned.  Her tube feeds were slowly advanced through
this time frame which she was able to tolerate.  She was
extubated on [**2170-9-19**], and was able to tolerate for a day,
however, she had an episode of bradycardia and asystole on
[**2170-9-20**], requiring emergent intubation.  She responded to
Epinephrine and returned to sinus rhythm with her blood
pressure returning to greater than 200.  It was noted that
the patient had increased distention of her abdomen after
this event of respiratory failure with difficulty to intubate
and she was noted to have some increased erythema around the
graft site.  Her gastrostomy tube was placed to gravity due
to the distention and nasogastric tube which had been placed
was removed.  The patient was successfully extubated again
after response of her respiratory failure.  She continued to
slowly improve after these events.  She slowly improved from
her ventilatory standpoint and she was continued on TPN for
support for this.  A vac was placed over her wound site for
her erythema and she was diuresed for her pulmonary status as
well as for her fluid overload.  The vac was managed by the
plastic surgery service and was changed multiple times with
assessment of her skin graft on every change.  Her donor site
was doing well and continued on blow drying of the wound site
and dressing changes.  Just prior to discharge to
rehabilitation, her vac dressing was removed and two small
areas of questionable success and viability of the graft were
noted.  It was decided that Xeroform gauze dressing changes
would be used over the skin graft site for continued wound
care.  She was restarted no her tube feeds on [**2170-9-26**], after
being held and which she tolerated.  Her tube feeds were
slowly increased over the next couple days.  The patient
continued on broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Zaroxolyn, Fluconazole and as stated
before Zosyn.  She was also given a course of Linezolid.  She
was able to be weaned over a very long period down to a
pressure support of 5 and PEEP of 5 and it is planned that
the patient would be extubated after being successfully
diuresed.  Her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains which had been placed
intraoperatively were removed by the plastic surgery service
after decreased output was noted.  After significant
diuresis, the patient was able to tolerate extubation as well
as able to tolerate low pressure support and minimal vent
settings.  Therefore, it was decided the patient would be
extubated.  The patient was extubated on [**2170-10-4**], which she
was able to successfully maintain her oxygenation and breathe
comfortably.  The patient was started on a clear liquid diet
on [**2170-10-5**], which she tolerated.  She had return of bowel
function during her Intensive Care Unit stay and her wounds
