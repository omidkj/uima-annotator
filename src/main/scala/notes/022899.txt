History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old man severe 2VD and multiple caths in the
past with stents and brachytherapy. He was initially admitted to
[**Location (un) **] following chest pain induced by an argument. There he
ruled in for a NSTEMI. He was then transferred here on [**7-19**] and
underwent cath which showed a 90% mid RCA and 100% LAD at the
site of his prior brachytherapy. He was not intervened on since
he has had multiple PCI to the LAD lesion in the past. He was
reffered for CT [**Doctor First Name **], however, the patient initially declined.
Because of his recent h/o HI and SI, he was admitted voluntarily
to the [**Hospital1 18**] psych unit. On his first night there, he developed
[**7-3**] left sided chest pressure overnight for 1 hour. He did not
tell anyone until the afternoon of [**7-22**]. He is now being
transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for r/o MI. Also, he is
precontemplative about CABG and would like to undergo the workup
while here.
     The paitent currently feels well. He has no CP, SOB, or
pain of any kind. He is apprehensive and thoughtful about the
CABG. He has many quetions that I spent 30 minutes answering. He
would also like to speak with CT [**Doctor First Name **] further. He denies SI or
HI but knows that he is severly depressed.
