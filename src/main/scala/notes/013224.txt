Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia, hypotension, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization
2. Colonoscopy
3. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
4. PICC LINE PLACEMENT

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 37y/o African American female with a history of Crohn's
Disease s/p 2 partial small bowel resections and a history of
CHF with a documented EF of 30% who presented from the stress
test lab with the complaint of resting tachycardia to 180 and
hypotension at SBP 80.  The patient had been experiencing
abdominal pain with frequent stools (10-12 per day), with pain
relieved by stooling.  Stools were non-bloody, loose, lots of
mucus.  Pt stated that these symptoms were similar to what she
gets when she has a Crohn's flare.  Her last flare was roughly a
month ago, resulting in a 5 day hospitalization.  She has tried
Remicade in the past, but it did not work very well for her.
She has noted a decrease in PO intake along with her frequent
stooling, and feels thirsty all the time.  She stated that she
gets dizzy when she stands up quickly.  She also noted that she
has had some chest pain in the past weeks to months.  Her chest
pain was worse with exertion, was accompanied by SOB, and
improved with rest.  The chest pain was non-radiating.  This CP
was the reason for her stress test on the day of admission.
Unfortunately, the test was not able to be performed due to her
hemodynamic instability.  She has not experienced F/C.  She
noted nausea/vomiting if she ate a large meal.  She denied
dysuria/hematuria.  She noted rectal and abdominal pain as
above, relieved by stooling.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2204-9-2**] 2:25 PM

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT

Reason: dvt Vs cellulitis

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
37 year old woman with hypotension/tachycardia, cardiomyopathy
s/p PICC with increasing RUE edema and pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
dvt Vs cellulitis
INDICATION: 37-year-old woman with increasing right upper
extremity edema.

COMPARISON: [**2204-8-28**], right upper extremity ultrasound.

FINDINGS: As previously identified, there is a large thrombus
extending from the axillary vein into the brachial vein and the
subclavian. There has been no significant change in the short
interval.

RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: 2D, color and Doppler waveform
imaging was obtained of the right common femoral, superficial
femoral and popliteal veins. Normal compressibility, waveforms
and augmentation was demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus
identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis.

Mucosal biopsies, two:



A.  Ileum:

Chronic active inflammation with ulceration and granulation
tissue.  See note.

B.  Left colon:

Chronic active inflammation with ulceration and granulation
tissue.

Note:  No granulomas, viral inclusions, or dysplasia seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Tachycardia/hypotension/CHF:  Initial EKGs revealed sinus
tachycardia up to 160s. Pt was initially given limited fluids in
light of recent EF of 30%. Given her acute decline in EF,
cardiology was consulted and considered catheterization
necessary to r/o ischemia as a cause of this new cardiomyopathy.
Catheterization was performed on [**2204-8-24**] without complications.
On cath she was noted to have: No angiographic evidence of
coronary artery disease.  Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
 Normal left and right sided filling pressures.  LVEF was 50%
with mild apical hypokinesis. Workup for other causes of sinus
tachycardia was continued, revealing negative cosyntropin test
for adrenal insufficiency, negative urine catecholamines for
pheochromocytoma. Pt did not present with symptoms c/w sepsis or
anaphylaxis. Lack of pulmonary complaints or findings made PE or
tension PTX unlikely. Lack of pericardial rub, JVD, or pleuritic
CP made tamponade less likely.  Pt was noted to have a HCT drop
the day after her cardiac catheterization ([**8-25**]).  No source of
bleeding was identified, but due to the patient's tenuous
hemodynamic status she was transferred to the CCU for further
management.  A CT scan showed signs of volume overload, but no
evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.  A vascular examination of
the RLE catheterization site showed no evidence of hematoma from
the cath.  Essentially, no source was identified for the
hematocrit drop, and following transfusion the patient
maintained a stable Hct.  Due to continuing fevers and her
Crohn's disease, she was started on Meropenem to cover
translocation of gut bacteria.  She continued to have periods of
hypotension and tachycardia, but this was not fundamentally
different from her presenting symptoms.  She was transferred
back to the primary medical team on [**8-28**]. From that point
onwards, patient's tachycrdia improved and eventually abated as
her Crohn's disease was adressed and treated. No further acute
cardiac events occurred and patient remained stable on
telemetry.
.
2.  Crohn's Disease:  On [**8-29**] pt underwent colonoscopy & EGD to
evaluate the status of her Crohn's disease. This revealed
friability, ulceration, erythema, & congestion in the descending
colon, sigmoid colon, & terminal ileum compatible with Crohn's.
There was also friability & erythema in the proximal anal canal.
EGD showed a normal upper GI tract through D3. Per GI
recommendations, pt was started on IV solumedrol for Crohn's
flare and TPN for malnourished state. Diet was advanced as
tolerated to a low-residue, high protein, lactose-restricted
diet.  The patient was started on Asacol and Cipro/Flagyl in
light of the flare. Patient was also changed to Prednisone by
time of discharge. The patient was dis
