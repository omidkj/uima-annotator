Allergies:
Amoxicillin / Tegretol / Dilantin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation x 2
Tracheostomy
Peg tube placement

History of Present Illness:
82 yo M with with tracheomalacia secondary to T-tube placement
in
the setting of stroke, now with chronic tracheostomy since [**3-27**]
presented to OSH on [**2117-10-22**] with resp failure, cough and fever.
Pt initially intubated on [**2115**] after a stroke. He had difficulty
weaning from the vent and underwent a tracheostomy. Pt was then
weaned from the vent and a T-tube was placed for tracheomalacia.
Pt followed here by IP. Pt continued to do well over 2.5 years
and T-tube removed, pt allowed to decannulate. Pt then presented
to [**Hospital6 **] ED on [**2117-10-22**] with a 2 day hx of SOB,
cough and fever. Pt was seen in outpatient clinic with complaint
of difficultly clearing secretions and was treated with abx and
pulm toilet without improvement. There was also a question of
aspiration per pts wife as he has had choking episodes while
eating. Pt was admitted to OSH MICU and intubated for resp
failure. CXR noted R-sided atelectasis which resolved after
intubation. Pt was started on Vanc and Levo for suspected
aspiration PNA. Pt was able to breathe spontaneously for a few
hours on am of [**10-24**] but failed extubation due to increased
secreations and poor gag. Pt then self extubated on [**10-24**] and
required reintubation. Pt was afebrile during this admission, he
had one episode of transient hypotension, cosyntropin test
negative. Resolved with IVF.
.
Pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] because he gets his pulmonary care here.
On arrival, pt intubated but responding to questions. Denies
pain and currently comfortable breathing.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2117-11-23**] 7:14 AM Reason: interval change
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-19**] through 29:
Endotracheal tube ends in the tracheobronchial stent, tip
between 3 and 4 cm from the carina.
Lungs are low in volume and mild left lower lobe atelectasis is
stable. Mild pulmonary edema unchanged. Heart size normal. No
appreciable pleural effusion. Nasogastric passes below the
diaphragm and out of view. Right jugular line can be traced as
far as the upper right atrium but the tip is indistinct. No
pneumothorax.

rhythm. Leftward axis. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2117-11-10**] no change.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Resp failure: possible etiologies included aspiration vs
bacterial PNA vs bronchitis. Likely combination of increased
secretions with tracheomalacia making pt unable to clear
secretions requiring intubation. Initial extubation was not
tolerated by the patient with increased respiratory distress,
requiring reintubation and eventual tracheostomy with prolonged
weaning course likely.
- Continued Vanc and Levoquin on admission given hx of MRSA PNA,
and was switched to and completed a 10 day course of Aztreonam
and Vanco. The patient spiked a temp to 101 several days after
completing this course and given that there was a witnessed
aspiration when he self d'c'd his NGT, he was restarted on Vanc
and Aztreonam for a 7 day course. All cultures were negative.
- was extubated and reintubated on [**11-4**] given acute resp
distress/stridor (fiberoptic intubation by IP). He was extubated
again on [**11-17**] and reintubated on [**11-19**] for tachypnea and
inability to clear secretions. It was d/w IP and family and
patient underwent tracheostomy [**11-23**].
.
2) Tracheomalacia: Pt followed by IP service. Underwent rigid
bronchoscopy on [**10-27**], which showed granulation tissue on the L
lateral wall of the trachea causing tracheal stenosis and
moderate to severe tracheobronchomalacia. The area of tracheal
stenosis was balloon dilated and the granulation tissue was
excised. He was transiently given Heliox for tenuous respiratory
status right after bronchoscopy. He was started on dexamethasone
post-bronchoscopy for empiric treatment of tracheolaryngeal
edema and continued on high dose guafenesin.
.
3) HTN: Continued metoprolol once more clinically stable. Pt has
been HD stable since admission. Initially underwent aggressive
diuresis for management of his resp distress, but with
reintubation on [**11-19**], patient's CVP's were 0-2 and MAP's were
less than 60, requiring 2 days of levophed gtt. Lasix was
stopped and aggressive fluid repletion with a goal of CVP 8-10
and MAP's>60 was started with good response and levophed was
able to be weaned [**11-20**].
.
4) CRI: Baseline 1.2-1.5. After repleting fluids, patient
remained in the lower range of his baseline for the rest of his
admission.
.
5) Hx CVA: continued aspirin.
.
6) Sz Disorder: Maintained on phenobarbital throughout
admission, dosing by level secondary to renal insufficiency.
