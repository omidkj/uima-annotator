Pertinent Results:
[**2136-7-9**]: L-spine x-ray:

IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes as detailed.

[**2136-7-9**]:  chest x-ray:

IMPRESSION: Findings of tiny right apical pneumothorax and right
posterior
third rib fracture better assessed on the concurrently performed
CT C-spine.
Extensive interstitial disease compatible with known chronic
small airways
disease.

[**2136-7-9**]:  cat scan of the head:

 IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process

[**2136-7-11**]: chest x-ray:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-10**], there is again
extensive
interstitial lung disease as seen on prior CT scan. No definite
pneumothorax is appreciated. Posterior rib fractures on the
right are difficult to identify and could better be seen on the
prior CT scan.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old female admitted to the acute care service after a
unwitnessed fall at home.  Upon admission, she was made NPO,
given intravenous fluids and underwent radiographic imaging of
her head, chest, and spine.  She was reported to have right
posterior [**3-27**] rib fractures with a small right apical
pneumothorax. She did note require chest tube placment.  The
acute pain service was consulted regarding possible placment of
epidural or spinal lumbar block.  Her rib pain was controlled
with intravenous and oral analgesics.  Her head cat scan was
normal and her cervical spine films showed no acute cervical
spine fracture with stable anterolisthesis of C4 on C5.
Because of her rib fractures and her history of bronchiectasis,
she was admitted to the trauma intensive care unit for pulmonary
optimization.   She was transferred to the surgical floor on HOD
#2.  Palliative care was consulted regarding her DNI/DNR status
and she was followed by the Geriatric service.
Since her arrival to the surgical floor, her vital signs have
been stable.  She is tolerating a regular diet.  She has resumed
her home pulmonary medications.  She was evaluated by physical
therapy and recommendations made for discharge to a extended
care facility because of her deconditioning.  On hosptial day
HOD #4, she was noted to be hyperkalemic to 5.7 and
hyponatrremic to 125.   The renal service was consulted and
recommendations made for fluid restriction and additional normal
saline infusion.  Over the next 24 hours, her electrolytes were
monitored and normalized.  Her current potassium is 5.0 and a
sodium of 132.  Her creatinine is 0.5 with a BUN of 15.
She is preparing for discharge to a extended care facility.  She
will continue to require monitoring of her potassium and sodium
every other day until she has normalized.  She will need to
follow up with her primary care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week and with the
acute care service in 2 weeks.
