Brief Hospital Course:
Diabetes mellitus type 1 status post kidney transplant now
admitted for PAK.
During the surgical procedure the pancreas pinked-up
immediately, and the duodenum began filling with exocrine
secretions. Once hemorrhage was controlled from the gland
itself, duodenojejunostomy completed. The jejunum was
anastomosed side-to-side to the duodenum. Patient extubated in
the OR. Please see op note for additional details.
In the immediate post op period the patient was transferred to
the ICU. It was noted that bladder pressure increased overnight,
and was also reintubated due to increasing respiratory distress
and hypotension.
Extubated on POD 3. Serial Abdominal exams revealed protuberant
abdomen, but softer and appropriately tender. Abdominal wound
intermittently had large amounts of sero-sang drainage when
patient coughed. Pancreas U/S showed the pancreas transplant
identified in the right mid abdomen with no discrete
peripancreatic collections. Ascites was noted. Arterial flow is
abnormal with a resistive index of one and no flow in diastole,
however, the entire graft is well vascularized and venous
outflow was normal. Arterial waveforms may reflect swelling due
to transplant pancreatitis.
Patient received ATG 100 intra-op and then 4 additional doses of
75 mg through POD 4 for a total of 5 doses. Continued on Prograf
and Cellcept. Creatinine had one bump to 1.9 on POD [**10-17**] but
otherwise remained around baseline of 1.0. Blood sugars were
variable with occasional BS > 200, but mostly 100-150. Amylase
and lipase initially elevated but returned to [**Location 213**] by POD 7.
Patient transferred to floor on POD 5.
Patients' abdomen was noted to be more distended, and on POD 6,
CT exam of abdomen showed: thrombus in the donor venous
anastomosis extending to the recipient inferior vena cava, as
well as likely compromised arterial supply to the transplanted
pancreas with findings suggestive of necrosis within the
pancreas head. Plan was to place an IVC filter with possible
thrombectomy/thrombolysis. Patient underwent uncomplicated
deployment of a Gunther tulip IVC filter via the right IJ
approach, with filter placed just above the IVC thrombus tip. If
removal of filter is considered, this would be best performed
within 2-3 weeks from now. (By [**2104-1-15**]) At the same time there
were failed attempts to opacify and catheterize the transplant
outflow vein. Patient was kept anticoagulated overnight and a
pancreatectomy of the transplant pancreas was performed on
[**2103-12-26**]. During the procedure, the pancreas was inspected on
the back table, it appeared to
be mainly a venous thrombosis. An organized clot at the Y graft
to SMA anastomosis was seen. The anastomoses themselves appeared
to be intact. Biopsy results showed
-Vascular thrombosis of major vessels, with transmural
hemorrhagic necrosis of donor duodenal wall.
-Mucosal ischemic necrosis involves both duodenal resection
margins.
-Pancreatic parenchyma with localized areas of necrosis and
acute inflammation, consistent with vascular ischemia.
Wound VAC was placed to the abdominal wound at the closure of
the pancreatectomy due to some necrotic subcutaeous tissue.
Patient was transferred back to the SICU following the
pancreatectomy.
CMV negative on [**2103-12-27**]
Patient complained of increased abdominal pain. CT exam of
abdomen on [**2104-1-7**] showed a 5 x 6 cm fluid collection with
enhancing wall in the right lower quadrant extending from the
level just inferior to the right lobe of the liver to the renal
transplant (in the old pancreas transplant bed). A second small
phlegmonous area was seen inferiorly and posteriorly to this
larger collection. Two small encapsulated fluid collections were
seen at the pancreatic arterial anastomotic site and adjacent to
the anterior abdominal wall as described above. On [**2104-1-8**],
drainage of collection resulted in 20 mL of serous sanguinous
fluid. A pigtail drain was left in place. Gram stain showed no
bacteria and cultures are negative after 48 hours. WBC was 225.
Amylase 19, T bili 1.7. A large clot was noted in the fluid.
Patient continued to improve. Diet advanced. Last day of TPN
[**2104-1-10**]
Coumadin therapy initiated on [**1-5**] due to thrombus and filter
placement. Patient will continue Coumadin as an outpatient.
On [**2104-1-11**] an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve the Gunther filter
was tried. The filter remains in at the time of discharge.
Patient continued to convalesce, started eating a bit better and
got blood sugars under control. Will continue on Lantus and
Humalog at home. [**Last Name (un) **] offered support during hospitalization
and is available for post care if patient requests.
Wound VAC changed on day of discharge. Will continue at home for
now. Assessment of need for continuing will be at outpatient
appointment. Wound appears well granulated but remains deep and
wide.
Will continue MMF and Prograf for immunosuppression for kidney
transplant.
Also sent home with Valcyte and Bactrim
