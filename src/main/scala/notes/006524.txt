History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1456**] is a [**Age over 90 **]F w/remote hx cigarette smoking, COPD,
breast cancer, recent traumatic L rib fracture c/b pneumothorax
who has been admitted 3x within the past month since she
fractured her rib. Previously she was independent and mobile,
with minimal COPD symptoms and no exercise limitation, no home
O2. Lived alone in elder living and was active in the community
per her report. Since her rib fractures in early [**Month (only) 404**], she's
had a 2L oxygen requirement and persistent difficulty breathing.
This has been attributed to COPD, and she has been continued on
inhalers and nebs. Most recently she was sent home with a short
oral prednisone taper. Over the past few days she's had
difficulty breathing which usually responded to her inhaler.
Yesterday she got no relief from inhalers or nebs. Notes that
she had forgotten to take her morning prednisone so she took
"only the afternoon dose" of 10 mg (she was written for 20 mg
QD) per discharge notes/prescription. She presented to the ED
via ambulance.
.
In the ED yesterday, VS were T 99 HR 100 BP 123/65 RR 44 O2 sat
99%/ NRB. Labs notable for WBC 14. CXR was unchanged from prior,
with hyperexpansion, no bullae, no focal consolidation (except
linear atelectasis of RLL), no PTX. She was given Solu-Medrol
125mg IV, Combivent and Azithromycin and experienced rapid
relief of dyspnea.
.
Overnight on the floor she received nebs for intermittent
dyspnea. Continued to complain of mild chest tightness, cough
(w/inability to clear mucus), and a feeling of being able to
exhale. Cough productive of small amounts clear white sputum.
Denies any persistent pain at the site of her L rib fracture. No
difficulty inhaling deeply, no pleuritic chest pain. No recent
fever or chills. No known sick contacts.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
As per HPI. Again, she denies fever, chills, night sweats,
headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

IMAGING
.
[**3-7**] CXR (prelim):
FINDINGS: The heart size is within normal limits. The
mediastinal contours demonstrate a tortuous aorta. The lung
architecture appears coarsened, but there is no consolidation or
pulmonary edema. The hemidiaphragms are flattened, suggestive of
chronic obstructive disease. There is no large pleural effusion
or pneumothorax. Again clips project over the right lower chest.
Incompletely healed left rib fractures are noted.
IMPRESSION: Finding suggestive of chronic obstructive disease,
but no acute cardiopulmonary process. Incompletely healed left
rib

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F w/hx of COPD, breast cancer and recent O2 requirement after
traumatic L rib fracture presents w/worsening dyspnea likely [**3-1**]
COPD exacerbation.
.
# COPD Exacerbation:
Patient has known COPD, for which she last saw pulm 1 yr ago. No
O2 requirement at baseline until 1 month ago when she suffered
traumatic rib fractures/PTX; since then never recovered full
pulmonary function. Ongoing/worsening symptoms dossibly due to
overly quick taper, missed steroid dose yesterday at home and/or
untreated URI. Clinically she was clearly having a COPD
exacerbation, with distanct heart lung sounds, absent wheeze,
tripoding, pursed-lip breathing and using accessory muscles.
Symptoms initially responded to increased-frequency
nebs/humidified air and relaxation techniques, but with minimal
exertion such as [**3-2**] consecutive sentences she became acutely
SOB. We also considered the possibility that she may have
developed a PE too given recent decrease in mobility, recent
trauma, and hx malignancy but felt her clinical status was too
unstable to send her for CTA; LENI of both legs was negative for
DVT. She was started on levaquin IV, IV steroids, and IV
morphine PRN. Confirmed DNR/DNI status w/patient but she was
amenable to ICU transfer for BiPAP. Overnight in the ICU, she
imroved on BiPAP and was weaned to nasal canula with improvement
in her symptoms. She felt that her breathing was back to
baseline so she was transferred back to the floor. On the floor,
continued on continuous oxygen monitoring w/telemetry, frequent
nebulizer treatments (scheduled +PRN), morphine PRN for acute
(normoxic) tachypneic episodes, and nocturnal biPAP. Discharged
with plan for very slow prednisone taper, no antibiotics. Pulm
follow-up evaluation arranged.
