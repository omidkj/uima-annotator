Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis, Multiple foot debridements

History of Present Illness:
This a 62 yo M with cirrhosis [**3-12**] NASH, hepatorenal syndrome,
and chronic non-healing superinfected RLE wound (VRE and C.
[**Month/Day (2) 563**]) in the setting of various foot/malleolar dislocations
and fractures followed by multiple debridements, initially
admitted for altered mental status, with extended hospital
course complicated by UGI bleed who was transferred to the MICU
for worsening encephalopathy/AMS on [**2120-4-13**].
.
In the MICU, the patient was kept on a NRB with continued
respiratory distress. The patient then acutely decompensated and
failed a trial of noninvasive ventilation, and was ultimately
intubated. The patient had a L IJ hemodialysis line for
emergency dialysis. He had multiple rounds of CVVH. He was
started on levophed for hypotension. CVVH was stopped an HD was
initiated. The patient mental status was treated with lactulose.
He also became febrile so zosyn was stopped and meropenem was
started for a time. He is currently on
daptomycin/meropenem/micafungin. The patient mental status
improved and he was successfully extubated. He was also weaned
from levophed and was tolerating HD well. He went to the OR for
right leg washout on [**2120-4-15**]. He is currently on q3day vac
changes. ID followed the patient while in the ICU, and
recommended a 6 week course of abx after the last orthopedics
intervention. His mental status remained clear and he was
hemodynamically stable. He was transferred to the floor.

STUDIES:
[**2120-3-26**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Slight intraventricular conduction
delay with left axis deviation may be due to left anterior
fascicular block. Since the previous tracing of the same date no
significant change.
.
[**2120-3-26**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Silhouette of the left heart border,
could reflect a lingular atelectasis or consolidation. A lateral
view, if clinically feasible, would be helpful in further
characterization.
.
[**2120-3-26**] LENI: IMPRESSION: No DVT in bilateral lower extremities.
.
[**2120-3-29**] Liver US: IMPRESSION: 1. Nodular hepatic architecture
with no focal liver lesion identified. 2. Patent hepatic
vasculature. 3. Splenomegaly. 4. Large amount of ascites.
.
[**2120-4-16**] TTE: The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global
biventricularsystolic function.
.
[**2120-4-26**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, there is
no relevant change. Small lung volumes, bilateral areas of
atelectasis, but no evidence of focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube
and of the right double-lumen catheter. Borderline size of the
cardiac silhouette.



Brief Hospital Course:
62-year-old male with history of DM on insulin, [**Month/Day/Year 2091**], R ORIF with
Ex-Fix in place who presents from rehab with altered mental
status and low sugar.
.
# Right lower extremity infection: The patient has a chronic
right lower extremity cellulitis and osteomyelitis secondary to
a traumatic R tibiotalar posterior dislocation and open
trimalleolar fracture s/p external fixation [**2120-3-7**]. He is s/p
multiple debridements and revisions with non healing R ankle
wound. Cultures from the infection include VRE and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**]. He is being treated with antibiotics including
daptomycin and micafungin.  Daptomycin and micafungin are to
continue for 6 weeks after last last debridement.  The last day
of antibiotics will be [**2120-5-26**].  Pt has a vac dressing in place,
which needs to be changed q3d.
.
# Altered mental status: The patient has multiple etiologies of
his altered m
