Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: This is an 85 year old gentleman with a
history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure and
recent medically treated cholecystitis who presented with
recurrent cholecystitis that was treated with percutaneous
drainage and antibiotics.  His hospital course was complicated
by delirium and mild pulmonary edema.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS: Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] presented with right upper
quadrant pain and nausea and fatigue. Labs significant for
normal LFTs. RUQ ultrasound demonstrate dacute cholecystitis.
Suurgery was consulted and recommended percutaneous drainage of
his gallbladder which was carried out by IR. Initial pus was
drained from the gallbladder which transioned to bilious
drainage on Day # 2 of admission. He was covered with Vancomycin
and Zosyn initially. Culture data from the biliary drain grew
ecoli sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Antibiotic therapy was changed
to ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to include anaerobic coverage
for a total of 14 days.  His biliary drain was kept in place
with plan for discontinuation by general surgery in [**5-25**] weeks.
He was afebrile for the duration of his hospital course.
.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: On admission he was noted be dyspneic.
An initial chest xray was concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia that could not be ruled out in the setting of
pulmonary edema. He was initially on vancomycin and zosyn on
admission to the intensive care unit.  While diuresis was
initially held on secondary to concern for acute kidney injury
his pulmonary edema accumulated during his initial hospital
days.  He was given IV lasix 20mg twice and restarted on his
home dose of lasix 20mg daily.  This dose was uptitrated to 40mg
daily which appeared to better control his volume status and
improved his breathing. An echo demonstrated symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with cavity dilation and global systolic
dysfunction suggestive of a non-ischemic pattern with EF 25%. A
low dose ace-inhibitor (lisinopril 5mg) was started and he was
continued on an aspirin and beta blocker. He reported no cough
and was afebrile for the duration of hospitalization.  A repeat
chest xray after diuresis revealed no evidence of pneumonia. His
nighttime oxygen saturations were noted to be stably in the low
90s.
.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION: A urine sample from admission was
concerning for infection and culture grew ecoli sensitive to
ciprofloxacin. A repeat UA prior to discharge was clear of
infection.
.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] is rate controlled with metoprolol
and anticoagulated with aspirin given fall risk.  He was noted
to have heart rates in the 110s with frequent episodes of non
sustained ventricular tachycardia, therfore his metoprolol was
incrased to 50mg three times a day with improvement in the
frequency of NSVT and heart rates in the 60-70s during the day.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed with management changes.
There was a question of whether he was on domperidone in the
past. It was taken off his medication list.
.
DELIRIUM: Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] was noted to have progressive delirium
throughout his hospitalization which was improving prior to
discharge. No pharmacologic agents were required for management.
He had an attentive family at his bedside at all his times.
Repeat infectious work-up including UA, chest xray and cdiff
toxin were negative for infection. His electrolytes were stable.
