Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Meningioma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2152-5-4**]: Occipital craniotomy for Meningioma resection


History of Present Illness:
70yo woman that was recently traveling in [**State 8842**] for 1 month. At
the end of [**Month (only) 956**] she had a couple of incidents  where she
bumped her head on the back of the trunk of the car. She
describes these as mechanical and denies losing her balance,
LOC, dizziness or other cause. Shortly thereafter she developed
a headache which was quite significant especially on the plane
ride home [**2152-3-24**]. She contact[**Name (NI) **] her PCP who requested [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT scan
which revealed a extra-axial midline mass. She was admitted from
clinic for further workup.

She underwent stereotactic brain biopsy in early [**Month (only) 958**] and the
lesion was found to be a meningioma. She returns today for
elective resection of the lesion.

Pertinent Results:
MRI WAND
Enhancing mass posterior to the corpus callosum, most likely a
meningioma, measuring approximately 3.5 cm in size. Indentation
on the
posterior aspect of the lateral ventricles is seen.

[**5-4**] CT head - 1. Post-pineal region meningioma resection with
residual rim of calcified material in the post-surgical bed.
Hyperdense material within the post-surgical bed could reflect a
small amount of blood product, or Surgicel.
2. Extensive pneumocephalus, but without significant midline
shift.

[**5-5**] MRI brain with and w/o contrast -
1. Postoperative changes in the surgical bed include a small
amount of blood and possible residual calcification along the
tentorium. There is no
hydrocephalus or ischemia.
2. Bilateral mastoid air cell opacification

[**5-9**] CTA-Head:IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative changes as described above. There continues to
be a fluid
collection within the posterior extra-axial space mildly
displacing the major sinuses anteriorly without stenosis. The
pneumocephalus has significantly decreased with minimal residual
pneumocephalus within the extraaxial collection. The residual
tumor, which demonstrates calcification and is inferior within
the surgical bed and is stable.
2. The right frontal ventricular catheter is unchanged in
position. There is minimal hyperdensity along the catheter tract
near the right frontal cortex and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction
which was likely present on the prior MRI [**2152-5-5**] and may
represent minimal hemorrhage within and along the catheter
tract. There may be subtle diminished hypodensity of the white
matter surrounding this hemorrhage, suggesting minimal edema
without significant mass effect.The ventricles are unchanged in
size compared to the prior study and are not enlarged.
3. The non-contrast CT of the head does not demonstrate new
intracranial
hemorrhage, new mass effect, or territorial infarction. 4. The
CTA is
normal.
5. The CTV demonstrates patent internal cerebral veins, vein of
[**Male First Name (un) 2096**] and the superior sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid
sinuses. As noted on prior
studies, the inferior sagittal sinus is not seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively of 4.14 for resection of her
meningioma. She underwent occipital craniotomy for resection of
her lesion and was transported to the ICU intubated following
her procedure. She remained intubated int eh ICU while awaiting
her MRI however she was following commands briskly and moving
all extremities while on the vent. She had her MRI and was
extubated shortly there after. Her diet was advanced and her
exam improved as well.

On [**5-6**], the patient neurological exam was improved.  The
patient exhibited full strength and was alert and oriented to
person , place and time. The corrected serum dilantin level 9.5
was 11.

On [**5-7**] she was deemed fit for transfer to the stepdown unit for
further management
The external ventricular Drain was rasied to 20 H2Ocm above the
tragus.  The foley catheter was discontinued.  The patient
retained urine overnight and was straight cathed.

On [**5-8**], The ventricular drain was clamped at 0900.  The central
line was discontinued. The corrected serum dilantin level was
9.3 and a Dilantin bolus of 250mg intravenous was given. The
patient was blsdder scanned in the early afternoon for 790cc and
was straight cathed.On exam, the patient exhibited full
strength. She was alert-oriented x to person place and time.
There was no drift or facial droop. The pupils were 3-2 mm brisk
reaction.  There was scant drainage from occipital incision.
Central line was d/c'd on [**5-8**] in routine fashion. Then, she
continued to have difficulty with urinary retention and required
several voiding trials which required straight cath on [**5-8**] and
[**5-9**].  Neuro opthamology was consulted for intermittent episodes
of visual changes.  They recommend outpatient follow-up.
A Head Ct with angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no
change in size of the ventricles.  CTA demostrated no stenosis
or aneurysm.  CTV demostrated no obtruction.

On [**5-9**] into [**5-11**] she was agitated, was refusing medications and
expressed paranoid thoughts.  This behavior was attributed to
steroid psychosis as she had been on high dose steroids since
her procedure and so her steroid dose was cut in half with a
rapid taper to off over 2 days.  Her symptoms were managed with
PRN Seroquel and haldol with limited effect.  Her delerium
improved once her dexamethasone was discontinued.

Her Coumadin was restarted at 5mg on [**5-10**] without load or
heparin bridge due to risk of intracranial bleeding.  INRs were
followed daily. INR on Discharge is 1.1 and should be followed
daily until she is therapeutic and then weekly while she is on
coumadin.

Now on [**5-12**], the day of discharge,
