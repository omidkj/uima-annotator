Reason for admission: severe aortic stenosis, exaccerbation of
diastolic heart failure

Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, chest pressure

HPI: Patient is an 89yo caucasian male with known aortic
stenosis
and CAD s/p CABGx4([**2123**])with postop course complicated by deep
sternal wound infection, occluded SVG graft to RCA s/p bare
metal
stent to RCA ([**2138**]), diabetes, CKD, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia who presented with c/o worsening shortness of
breath and chest pressure. He reports that he feels vague chest
pressure with ambulation or climbing a flight of stairs, if he
continues with the activity, he experiences blurred vision,
urinary incontinence, and confusion.
     He was evaluated at [**Hospital1 2025**] for aortic stenosis. Cardiac
surgery
deemed him at extreme risk for surgical aortic valve
replacement. He was also evaluated for the TAVI/[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Last Name (un) 30978**]
valve and was found to have an annulus too large for the device.
He was referred here for aortic valve treatment options. He
again was found to be of prohibitively extreme risk for
conventional surgical AVR.
     He was scheduled for elective cardiac cath but cancelled
due
to illness. He was later admitted for shortness of breath and
diaphoresis. He underwent urgent cardiac cath and was found to
have patent grafts and stent.
     On [**2139-7-25**] he was againg admitted with chest pain,
exaccerbation of diastolic CHF and NSTEMI. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for stabilization and BAV. He was then screened for
Corevalve TAVR after extensive discussion with patient and
family and informed consent was obtained. He met all inclusion
criteria and did not meet exclusion criteria. He now returns for
Corevalve/TAVR. Coumadin was discontinued 4 days prior to
admission.
