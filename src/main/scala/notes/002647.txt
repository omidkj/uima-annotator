CXR:
Suspicion of diffuse process in lungs possibly reoccurrence of
aspergillosis.  As translation of findings on plain chest
examination into findings observed on previous CT may be
difficult, consider the possibility to ascertain these new
findings by renewed CT examination of this patient known to have
rather advanced sarcoidosis.  Stat report delivered to emergency
room board.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: 48M with sarocoidosis, amyloidosis-->ESRD on HD
with hx mult line infections, who p/w MRSA bacteremia,
endocarditis, pre-vertebral cervical abscess.
.
# MRSA bacteremia/Pre-vertebral abscess/Endocarditis: Pt
presented with neck pain/stiffness. Found to have prevertebral
(c3-4) abscess with associated discitis/osteomyelitis on CT &
MRI.  Source likely MRSA bacteremia from infected HD catheter
(in L groin).  Blood cx's from [**6-15**] grew MRSA in [**8-8**] bottles;
cx's from [**6-17**] grew MRSA in [**2-2**] bottles.  Surveillance cultures,
following initiation of antibiotics, from [**6-18**] thru [**6-22**] were no
growth.  TTE showed moderate-sized
mobile vegetation on mitral valve, which will be treated with
antibiotics only. Pt was treated with both vancomycin and
gentamicin.  Gentamicin was discontinued on [**2134-6-25**], and the
patient was continued on vancomycin.  He went for a washout of
cervical abscess w/ neurosurgery on [**2134-6-24**]. Abscess grew MRSA
as well.  He is to continue on vancomycin 8wks from [**6-24**], which
was the date of his prevertebral abscess washout.  Pt
defervesced following initiation of antibiotics. A tunnelled
catheter was replaced in the groin on [**2134-7-5**].
  Neurosurgery does not feel that there is a need for follow up
imaging and he will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2134-7-26**].
.
# ESRD: Thought to be due to amyloidosis. He is status post
failed renal transplant. He is maintained on chronic HD on a
Tues-Thurs-Sat schedule.
.
# Right index finger pain: likely due to progressive dry
gangrene. He is status post amputation of distal portion on
[**2134-6-7**] by plastic surgery and given progression of gangrene, the
rest of the digit to the MCP was removed with flap revision on
[**2134-6-30**].
.
# Anemia: likely multi-factorial--related to CKD/anemia of
chronic disease & operative loses. He receives Epo at HD, was
stable during this admission.
.
# H/o asperg infxn: Itraconazole was continued for prophylaxis.
.
# H/o adrenal insufficiency: related to chronic steroid use (for
possible renal transplant or amyloid). He received stress dose
steroids for surgery and by the time of discharge had been
tapered down to his outpatient regimen of prednisone 5mg
alternating with 2.5mg daily.
.
# Delirium: CT head w/ contrast unremarkable. Altered mental
status attributed to infection exacerbated by pain medication.
By the time of discharge, patient was back to baseline.
.
# DM: well controlled on insulin sliding scale.
.
# Afib: The patient was in NSR throughout the admission. His
metoprolol was continued, but given his multiple procedures and
also given that his INR was supratherapeutic on admission, his
coumadin was held. It was restarted on the day of discharge,
with a goal of [**3-6**] which will have to be monitored upon
discharge.
.
# Psych: celexa was continued.
.
# FEN: Please maintain patient on a renal, diabetic, fluid
restricted (to 1.5L/day) diet.
.
# PPx: subcut heparin, ppi
.
