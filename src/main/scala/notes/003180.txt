Chief Complaint:
Nausea and vomiting

PICC


History of Present Illness:
37 yo M with recent admission for acute on chronic
pancreatitis caused by prior alcohol binge. He had a complicated
course, which included ARDS, emergent tracheostomy, E. coli
bacteremia, and MRSA pneumonia. He was discharge to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**10-8**]. He was doing reasonably well
there, where he was [**Month/Day (2) 19284**] a PMV during the day, tube feeds
were weaned off, and was he advanced to a regular diet. He
returns today after complaining of nausea and repeated vomiting,
with an estimated volume of 2300cc throughout the day. He also
had a temperature of 100.7. His WBC was down to 11K. He was on
Meropenem at the time of discharge, which was stopped on [**10-8**] to
complete a 2 week course for treatment of his GN bacteremia.
[**Location (un) **] through his progress notes from Rehab, it appears he has
had a significant amount of reflux, despite being on Prilosec. A
CT scan was obtained at the OSH, which raised concern of a
peripancreatic fluid collection with some compression of the
stomach and duodenum. He has a known pseudocyst, as noted on a
CT
done here on [**10-3**], measuring 9.4 (TRV) x 7.8 (AP) x 12.1 (CC)cm,
as well as a separate small fluid collection anterior to the
stomach. The images from the CT done at the OSH were not sent
with him.

He has been nauseated all day. He has had some abdominal pain,
mostly in the epigastrum, which is slightly more than baseline.
He has felt feverish and has had some chills. He continues to
complain of heart burn. His trach has been continually causing
him discomfort. He has a productive cough. He has been moving
his
bowels regularly.

Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of NG tube placement in a
patient with
ethanol pancreatitis.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to the prior study.
The NG tube was inserted in the meantime interval with its tip
coiling in the proximal
stomach. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No change
in bibasilar linear opacities consistent with atelectasis is
present. The tracheostomy is at the midline, with the tip
approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. The upper lungs are
unremarkable and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 37 yo M well known to General Surgery and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
following recent admission for acute on chronic pancreatitis
caused by EtOH binge complicated by respiratory failure, ARDS,
need for emergent trach, E. Coli bacteremia, and MRSA pneumonia.
Now presenting with nausea and vomiting for the last 24 hours,
suspicious for enlarging pseudocyst with outlet obstruction.
Lipase is normal, so recurrent pancreatitis seems unlikely. Low
grade fevers and leukocytosis suspicious for infectious process.
He may have early sepsis.

He was Pan Cx:
[**10-14**] BCx: GPC clusters; staph coag neg (1 set only)
[**10-14**] UA: [**6-16**] WBC, few bact, small Leuk, trace Protein

He was started on Vanc/Meropenem given recent MRSA PNA & E.coli
bacteremia
He was NPO/IVF's with LR 150cc/hr. He had a NGT/Foley.

A CT ABD was performed and unchanged pancreatic pseudocyts and
fluid collections. He likely had duodenal obstruction [**2-7**]
pseudocyst.
.

A PICC was placed and he was started on TPN. He required bowel
rest due to the pseudocyst and nausea. His abdomen was soft and
nontender with no peritoneal signs. The NGT was removed on HD5.
His TPN was ramped up and he was discharged to rehab with TPN
and ordered for sips of fluid.
He reported +flatus and +BM prior to discharge.

His antibiotics were stopped once the culture data came back
negative.

He will have a repeat CT on [**11-2**] and plan for OR
pseduocystgastrostomy on [**11-3**].

Resp: He was stable with trach in place. He was suctioned as
needed.
