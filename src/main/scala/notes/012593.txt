Sinus bradycardia with first degree A-V block. Left atrial
abnormality.

ischemia.
Low QRS voltages in the precordial leads. Since the previous

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Moderately depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
thickening of  mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles. Moderate to severe  (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA
systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. Posterior and apical
akinesis with  lateral hypokinesis is present.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review)  of [**2144-4-22**], LV function has
deteriorated.

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)

COMPARISON: [**2144-11-7**].

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:

Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Again
noted is calcification within the aorta. Again seen are median
sternotomy wires. Pulmonary vascularity appears within normal
limits. No focal consolidations are seen within the lungs. There
is no evidence of pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.









Brief Hospital Course:
The patient as placed on heparin drip and underwent angiogram
which showed occlusion of his common femoral artery on the left.
 A proposed fem-fem bypass was recommended.  The patient,
however, has had previous [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] surgery with bilateral groin
explorations and it was unclear whether he has had a previous
fem-fem bypass or peripheral distal bypass. Therefore, groin
exploration and possible fem- fem bypass is recommended.  The
patient agreed to proceed to
surgery.  Risks and benefits were explained and he consented.

The patient agreed to the below procedure:

PROCEDURE:
1.  Bilateral groin explorations.
2.  Left superficial femoral artery and profunda
    thrombectomy.
3.  Thrombectomy of femoral-femoral graft.
4.  Patch angioplasty of left common femoral artery.

Pt tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications. Pt
extubated in the OR. Transfered to the PACU in stable condition.
Once recovered from anesthesia. Pt transfered to the VICU in
stable condition.

Pt had normal post operative recovery.

On DC, pt is stable. taking PO / ambulating / urinating / pos BM
