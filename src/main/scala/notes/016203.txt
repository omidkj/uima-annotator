Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old female with a history of dementia, CVA, DM2, CHF,
chronic UTIs who presents with hematemesis and likely aspiration
PNA

# Hematemesis: In the ED PEG lavage showed coffee ground
material which cleared after 500 cc and her Hct was 29.9.
Likely UGIB- source gastritis vs duodenol vs gastric ulcer vs
esophageal ([**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **], varices).  No known liver cirrhosis.
She was placed on an IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI evaluated her and felt that
as her Hct has been stable, she did not need an emergent scope.
On the evening of [**3-11**] her Hct fell to 23 so she
received a unit of pRBC's.  Her hematocrit initially increased
appropriately but then fell again to the 23 range.  She received
a second unit of pRBC's on the evening of [**2198-3-12**] at which time
her hematocrit increased to 28 and remained stable at 29 the
next morning.  She had no guiac positive stools in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and
no hematemesis.  She remained hemodynamically stable.  Endoscopy
was ultimately not performed as the benefits outweighed the
indicated this chronically ill, severely demented woman.  Plan
is to continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]. H pylori remains pending at time of
discharge.

# PNA: Her ED CXR showed a RML infiltrate; left hemidiaphragm
also obscured- likely HAP vs aspiration given hematemsis.  She
was treated with vanc, cefepime, and flagyl as she was admitted
from a nursing home and there was concern for aspiration.
Sputum and blood cultures were sent and remained negative as of
the time of discharge.  PICC was placed for a 10 day course of
antibiotics for HAP.

# Chronic UTIs: She was recently treated at [**Hospital1 **] for UTI; UA
currently not very consistent with active infection (LE
negative- WBC 13).  Her foley was pulled.  Urine culture was
negative for growth.

# DM: She was continued on her outpatient insulin glargine and
RISS.  Her tube feeds were briefly stopped for concern of GI
bleed and during that time despite her glargine dose being
halved she had some asymptomatic hypoglycemia for which she
received 2 amps of dextrose.  At that point her tube feeds were
restarted and she was placed on half her usual glargine dose.
Her gluxose was high and her glardine dose was increased. This
will likely need continued adjustment in the outpatient setting.


# Dementia: The patient is quite demented at baseline and unable
to regularly answer questions appropriately.  This is her
baseline.  No further management was initiated.  At time of
discharge she was still unable to state name or follow basic
commands.

# Chronic heart failure: Unclear if systolic or diastolic; no
ECHO here.  The patient appeared mildly fluid overloaded on the
morning of [**2198-3-12**] and received 20 mg of furosemide IV.  Her CXR
improved with decreased hilar markings but as she still had an
O2 requirement she received another dose of IV furosemide on
[**2198-3-13**].  Her home CV meds ( captopril and metoprolol) were
switched to once a day formulations. Her isosorbide was held as
these pills were not able to be crushed and placed in PEG. She
does not tolerate ASA (allergy). Further titration of cardiac
medications is recommended in the outpatient setting.

# FEN: She was started on tube feeds on [**3-10**] as her third Hct
returned stable.   This was then held on [**2198-3-11**] as her
hematocrit was decreasing.  These were restarted on [**2198-3-13**] after
Hct was once again stable.  She was evaluated by the speech and
swallwing service. At that time, patient was not accepting pos
and recommended if patient taking/accepting pos would continue
trials of nectar thick liquids. She did swallow very small
amounts of nectar thick liquid from the cup with maximum cues
without overt s/sx of aspiration .Primary nutrition, hydration,
and medications should be via PEG tube.

# Code: FULL CODE: This was confirmed by the patient's daughter
who appeared to have very poor insight into her mother's
debiliated state and chance for meaningful recovery from
multiple chronic conditions and acute medical issues.
