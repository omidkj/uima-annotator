Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F
Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 41 year-old
woman with advanced aid CD4 count less then 30 admitted on
[**11-21**] with fever for the past few weeks and intractable
developed fever and cough with a question of right lower lobe
pneumonia and was started on Levofloxacin.  She was also
started on oral Fluconazole for thrush.  Her Levofloxacin was
changed to Augmentin as the patient continued to spike fevers
through the Levofloxacin.  The patient developed night sweats
as well as inguinal pain.  She was admitted on [**11-21**] for
evaluation of fever, night sweats and evaluation of vomiting

On admission the patient's O2 sat was 92%.  The chest x-ray
was read as diffuse interstitial infiltrates with bibasilar
air space opacities and small pleural effusions compatible
with PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] scan on [**11-22**] of the abdomen and chest showed
chronic lung changes manifested as interstitial thickening
with several punctate cystic lesions and increased
consolidation in the right upper and lower lobes with a
moderate right sided pleural effusion.  Pericholecystic fluid
was seen as well as extensive lymphadenopathy in the inguinal
region, thorax and supraclavicular and axillary regions.
Over the past two days the patient has had increasing fevers,
increasing oxygen requirements and dyspnea.  The patient was
started on Bactrim on [**11-22**] as well as Prednisone for
presumed PCP.  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-24**] chest x-ray repeated showed a
combined alveolar interstitial pattern, which has progressed
since [**11-22**].  The patient's antibiotics were broadened to
include Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone.  The [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] moonlighter
was called to see the patient at 10:00 p.m. with progressive
dyspnea and O2 requirements necessitating 100% nonrebreather.
The patient agreed to intubation and was taken directly to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for intubation.  The patient at that time denied
abdominal pain, chest pain and had been compliant with her
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  HIV since [**2102**], systolic murmur,
negative PPD, but anergic pneumonia as described.  Zoster in
a VI nerve distribution with post herpetic neuralgia, high
grade cervical dysplasia status post cryotherapy, anxiety,
depression, left sided oophorectomy, microbacterium in sputum
in [**2111**], migraines and herpes.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Bactrim, Darvon, Fluconazole,
Coletra, Imivudene, Stavudene, Lotrisone, Mycelex and
Remeron.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Heterosexual.  She obtained HIV through
intercourse with an intravenous drug abuser.  Positive
tobacco use.  Rare ethanol use.  G6 P6.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with emphysema.  Father with lung
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of
102.8.  Blood pressure 111/98 with an A line measuring 80/50.
Heart rate in the 150s, breathing at 15, tachypneic and
unable to speak in full sentences.  Neck bilateral anterior
and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.  Respiratory
bilateral crackles, no wheeze.  Heart was tachy with regular
rhythm.  Abdomen was benign.  No extremity edema.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 2.7, hematocrit 27.6,
platelets 44, sodium 136, potassium 4.3, chloride 98, bicarb
12, BUN and creatinine 11 and .4.  Glucose 81, anion gap 30,
ALT 26, AST 49, LDH 530, alkaline phosphatase 140, bilirubin
.4, calcium 7.8, albumin 2.2, phos 4.1, magnesium 1.8.  Chest
x-ray showed worsening alveolar interstitial infiltrates
bilaterally right greater then left.  Electrocardiogram
showed sinus tachycardia, coffee grounds were noted on OG
tube insertion after intubation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 41 year-old end stage who
with rapidly progressive pulmonary process likely bacterial
pneumonia, though PCP possible, but less likely.  The patient
was intubated and placed on assist control at 12 by 500 with
5 PEEP.  Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin were continued and
Bactrim and Prednisone for presumptive PCP were continued.
The patient was fluid resuscitated with hemodynamics
consistent with sepsis.  Protonix was given for stress ulcer
prophylaxis.  Marked anion gap acidosis likely secondary to
lactic acidosis.  Increased ventilation was used for
respiratory compensation.  Overnight the patient
progressively worsened with increasing oxygen requirements.
On the morning of the 19th a triple lumen catheter was placed
in the right femoral region without difficulty for further
access.  The patient became progressively more hypotensive
requiring considerable pressor support.

After extensive discussion with the primary care physician
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] and the family including the mother and daughter,
the decision was made to make the patient DNR and comfort
measures were instituted at 1:00 in the afternoon on [**11-25**].
The patient was extubated.  Pressors were discontinued and
morphine and Ativan were started.  The patient expired on
[**11-25**].
