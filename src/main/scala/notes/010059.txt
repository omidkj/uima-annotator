Final Report
CLINICAL HISTORY: Status post CABG, left lower lobe atelectasis.


CHEST:

The cardiac size is mildly enlarged, status post CABG. Some
reexpansion of
the atelectasis in the left lower lobe has occurred. There is
some still
persists. Blunting of the right and left costophrenic angle are
still
present. Lung fields are otherwise clear.

IMPRESSION: Improving.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  *1.3 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  15% to 20%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  3.2 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  2.1 cm  <= 2.5 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely and
globally depressed (LVEF= 15 - 20 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on Epi @ 0.03 mcg/kg/min + NTG @ .3.
Preserved RV systolic fxn.
LV systolic fxn is globally improved to an EF = 35 - 40%.
Trace - mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Aorta intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted for same day surgery and underwent coronary
artery bypass graft surgery.  See operative report for further
details.  He received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics.
He weaned from bypass on Epinephrine and Propofol. Post
operatively he was transferred to the intensive care unit for
management.  In the first twenty four hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
complications.  On post operative day one he was weaned off
Epinephrine and started on beta blockers.

 He had episodes of SVT and was treated with betablockers and
Amiodarone.  Physical Therapy worked with him on strength and
mobility.  He was transferred to the floor on post operative day
two. Diuresis was begun towards his preoperative weight.

He did have a moderate amount of nausea for a couple of days
after surgery, but that resolved with antinausea treatment and
he felt well. Discharge was planned for [**3-9**], on POD 4,
however, he had a vasovagal episode.  He recovered within
minutes and vital signs were stable.  He was ready for discharge
with services on post operative day five.
