Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3233**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, Poor appetite

Bone marrow biopsy ([**2120-7-2**])


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 yo woman with chronic cough, GERD, and CLL
diagnosed in [**2114-1-11**] s/p cycle 4 of
rituxan/fludarabine/neulasta in [**2120-4-11**] who presents with
increasing weakness, poor PO intake, weight loss, and paroxysmal
coughing. She was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 547**] for bone pain [**2-13**]
neulasta. She did well at first but over the past month has felt
that her "body is deteriorating," especially over the last week.
She states that she has had very poor appetite as food has no
taste, and also she is bothered by a metallic taste in her
mouth. She has become increasingly weak and inactive and has
lost weight. She forces herself to eat apple sauce, bananas,
scrambled eggs, but certain foods that are too dry (like an
English muffin) make her choke and trigger coughing spells. Her
throat is always very dry and easily irritated.
.
The coughing spells have been chronic for several years and
seemed to worsened last summer. They are productive of clear
phlegm that has not changed recently. They are triggered by
smells, foods, and moving around. She sometimes coughs so hard
that she vomits. Recently, she has started having midline chest
pain due to the coughing that radiates to her upper back.  She
has also been having fevers, chills, and sweats at home, though
fevers have always been < 100 degrees.
.
She was treated approximately 2 weeks ago for a UTI by her PCP,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17918**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 17919**]), with cipro 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and pyridium.
She was seen last week by her outpatient oncologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11636**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 62315**]), who was concerned about her anemia,
left shift, and rising LDH. A bone marrow biopsy was planned for
this coming Friday.
.
She states that there was no acute change that induced her to
present to [**Hospital1 18**] ED last night; her daughter had called her
pulmonologist who advised her to come into the ED.
.
This morning, she continues to have paroxysms of coughing and
poor appetite. She denies nausea, dyspnea, chest pain, or back
pain currently.
.
ROS: (+) As above. Also, positive for light-colored stools,
intermittent diarrhea, occasional nausea, dyspnea only with the
coughing spells.
(-) No sick contacts, recent travel, dysphagia, odynophagia,
dysuria, hematuria, hematochezia.

Pathology:
BMB [**6-28**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
     ATYPICAL LYMPHOID INFILTRATE CONSISTENT WITH LARGE CELL
TRANSFORMATION OF CLL/SLL LEFT SHIFTED MYELOID PRECURSORS AND
CIRCULATING BLASTS SEEN
.
Note: An atypical lymphoid infiltrate, which by flow cytometry
was comprised of B-cells coexpressing CD10 is seen.  This is
consistent with large cell transformation ([**Doctor Last Name **] type).  CD20,
CD30, CD15, CD3 are negative within the large cells.  CD3 and
CD5 highlights T cells.  Dim CD5 expression is seen in the large
cells.
.
While CD34, nTdT and CD117 are negative within the large cells,
a population of CD34 expressing events are noted by flow
cytometry.  In addition, myeloids appear left shifted (including
rare circulating blasts) and dysplasia is noted. Given the
history of chemotherapy, this could be consistent with therapy
related dysplastic changes.  Definitive diagnostic features of
acute myeloid leukemia is not seen in the current marrow
evaluation, which is limited by a sub-optimal aspirate. Close
follow and clinical correlation along with a repeat biopsy/
aspirate study is recommended at an interval. Findings discussed
at the BMT conference on [**2120-7-9**].
.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
.
Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
Erythrocytes are decreased in number, normocytic and
hypochromic.  They exhibit mild anisopoikilocytosis including
burr cells, stomatocytes, red cell fragments - occasional tear
drop cell.  Several nucleated red cells are seen.  The white
blood cell count appears decreased.  Rare pelgeroid forms and
neutrophils with toxic granules and vacuoles can be seen.
Occasional large atypical lymphoid cells with high N:C ratio,
dark blue cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli are present.
Platelet count appears markedly decreased.  Large forms are
seen.  A rare giant form is present.  Differential count shows
13% neutrophils, 5% bands, 11% monocytes, 65% lymphocytes, 1%
eosinophils, 2% basophils, 3% large atypical lymphoid cells.
Rare atypical cells suspicious for blasts are seen.
.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is suboptimal for
evaluation due to absence of spicules; however, a 100 cell count
was performed and reveals the following:  0% blasts, 0%
promyelocytes, 4% myelocytes, 3% metamyelocytes, 7% neutrophils,
0% plasma cells, 66% lymphocytes, 5% erythroid, 15% large,
atypical lymphoid cells. The M:E ratio cannot be reliably
assessed.  Several dysplastic granulocytes are present.
.
Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate  for evaluation
and consists of a 5 mm section of cortical and trabecular bone
and periosteum.  Cellularity is esti
