Abd/Pelvic CT [**3-25**] - Preliminary Report:

No hydronephrosis or hydroureter. Right and probable left
nonobstructive renal calculi measuring up to 1 cm on the right
side.

Bilateral renal tiny hypodensities, statistically represent
cysts.

Distended rectum containing stool.

Mildly distended gallbladder, otherwise unremarkable on CT. In
case of clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, an ultrasound
can be obtained.

Bilateral LE Veins [**3-25**] -
IMPRESSION: Severely limited study due to [**Hospital 228**] medical
condition and severe pain and lack of cooperation due to severe
pain. A repeat study can be obtained when patient is able to
tolerate this study. No definite deep venous thrombosis within
the common femoral veins. This exam is also limited due to
patient's subcutaneous edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old man with h/o cerebral palsy, atrial flutter, chronic
venous stasis, bilateral PE, and recurrent MRSA cellulitis,
presenting with LE cellulits, possible UTI and SVT.  He was
started on a diltiazem drip for aflutter.  In the ICU his
metoprolol was uptitrated which controlled his heart rate
reasonably well.  He was also transitioned oral antibiotics for
celulitis and UTI (Bactrim and Cipro).  At the time of dishcarge
to the floor he was still in aflutter, HR ~ 100.  On the floor
he was continued on Bactrim, Ciprofloxacin was discontinued
given questionable diagnosis of UTI (lack of symptoms) and given
Bactrim is typically sufficient treatment of UTI.  Diuresis was
also resumed for treatment of his lower extremity edema.

Prior to his discharge as his infection was improving patient
triggered for delirium.  It lasted for one day.  The following
morning delirium had resolved but he was kept overnight for
observation.  He was discharged at baseline mental status to
complete a 14 day course of antibiotics.

-recheck thyroid levels, levothyroxine increased
