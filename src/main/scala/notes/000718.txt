History of Present Illness:
64 year old patient of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73**] who lives part time in the
[**Country 13622**] and part time in the US, just returned from the
[**Country 13622**]. Hx of CABG/Mechanical MVR in [**2131**] at [**Hospital1 18**], HIV+
(dx'ed approx 7 yrs). Admitted to [**Hospital1 34**] on [**4-23**] with decompensated
heart failure, endocarditis of aortic valve (seen on TTE), LVEF
40-45%. Blood cultures grew Enterococcus but no follow-up blood
cultures drawn.  He states prior to admission he was getting
more short of breath, dry cough, his abdomen became more
distended, weight loss 15-20lb weight gain in past couple of
months, some abdominal pain, poor appetite, leg swelling.  He
notes one day of fever.  He denies any chest pain.

At [**Hospital6 33**], he was started on ceftriaxone and
azithro which was switched to Vancomycin, Gent, Ampicillin,
Azithro after ID was consulted.  His CD4 count was checked and
was 50 (Viral load checked but currently do not have these
results).  Patient does not know what medications he takes at
home, and has pill bottles of truvada and zerit.  He identifies
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6173**] as his ID physician although does not appear he has
seen him since [**2135**].  CT Abd/Pelvis done with old splenic
infarcts, ascites but no acute bowel pathology.  Patient/wife
state that approximately one month prior he had a GI Bleed
requiring transfusion.  They are unable to provide additional
info and tell me that they think he was admitted here (although
no record of this in our system).  Troponin 0.08, CK negative.
They wanted to do TEE at [**Hospital3 **] but he has been too SOB to
tolerate it. As of this morning, nurse states that his
respiratory status looks stable; patient is able to lie flat so
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for TEE and further evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
TEE ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2137-4-26**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. LV systolic function appears
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The gradients are
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. There is a 2.5
x 1 cm mass on the atrial side of the mitral valve prosthesis.
This may represent a vegetation or thombus. Mild to moderate
([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. This regurgitation is
central and there is no evidence of a paravalvular leak,
dehiscence, or abscess. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT TORSO [**2137-4-27**]:
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis are obtained with the administration of intravenous
contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**], 130 cc of Optiray. Multiplanar reformation
images are reconstructed.
CHEST: The patient is status post CABG with median sternotomy.
Coronary
arteries are calcified. There is moderate cardiomegaly. The
patient is post mitral valve replacement. There is edema in the
mediastinum. Right
hemidiaphragm is eventrated. There is bilateral small pleural
effusion. In
the lung window, note is made of bibasilar plate-like
atelectasis. Evaluation of the lung is somewhat limited due to
motion artifact. There is diffuse anasarca.
ABDOMEN: There is massive ascites, as mentioned in the history.
There is no evidence of free air or fluid collection or abscess
in the abdomen.
Gallbladder is unremarkable without evidence of calcification.
There is a
large cystic lesion in the spleen, measuring 5.6 cm. There is no
evidence of bowel obstruction. There is no calcification in the
gallbladder. Pancreas is unremarkable. Adrenal glands and
kidneys are within normal limits. The hepatic vasculatures are
not completely assessed on this single-phase study, however,
there is no definite clot in the portal vein visualized. There
are several areas of hypodensities in the spleen.
PELVIS: There is massive ascites. Appendix is normal filled with
oral
contrast. There is no evidence of bowel dilatation.
There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal
structures.
IMPRESSION:
1. Massive ascites and anasarca. No evidence of abscess or fluid
collection in the abdomen.
2. 5.6 cm fluid collection in the spleen with several foci of
hypodensity in the spleen, probably representing infarction with
necrosis. There is no
secondary sign of infection.
3. Atelectasis in the lungs with edema in the mediastinum and
cardiomegaly, post-CABG.

LIVER ultrasound with dopplers [**2137-4-27**]: 1. Heterogeneous nodular
liver consistent with history of cirrhosis with associated free
fluid. No focal liver lesions identified. 2. Normal hepatic
Doppler waveforms.

EGD [**2137-5-1**]: No esophageal varices.  Dieulafoy lesion in the
proximal stomach body (ligation).  There was no portal
hypertensive gastropathy, andd no gastric varices.  Blood in the
stomach body.  Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the
duodenum

EGD [**2137-5-7**]: Grade I esophageal varices in the distal esophagus.
Erythema and congestion in the stomach.  Normal mucosa in the
duodenum.  Recommendations: [**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor. No source
of bleeding seen on this exam. No contraindication to
coumadinization.

CXR [**2137-5-1**]: PICC with tip overlying proximal portion of the
superior vena
cava.

EGD [**2137-5-17**]:  Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus. Normal
mucosa in the stomach.  Normal mucosa in the duodenum.

COLONOSCOPY [**2137-5-17**]:  Impression: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.

Liver Biopsy Pathology [**2137-5-3**]:
Liver, transjugular biopsy:
1.  Minimal portal and lobular mononuclear inflammation.
2.  No fatty change, features of venous outflow obstruction are
seen..
3.  Trichrome stain shows focal increased sinusoidal fibrosis.
4.  Reticulin stain show
