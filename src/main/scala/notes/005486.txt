Hip X-rays (before surgery):
There is a fracture through the proximal shaft of the left
femur. This
fracture is through an area which is traversed by the stem of
the femoral head
prosthesis. The left hip joint appears intact. There are minor
OA changes
present at the right hip joint. The bones are osteopenic

CXR: Increased opacity in the RUL compared to prior films.

Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is asymmetric
septal hypertrophy with small cavity and very good systolic
function, but distal septal hypokinesis (LVEF = >55 %). No
resting LVOT gradient is identified. There is a mobile
echodensity in the left ventricular cavity c/w free papillary
muscle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. A
well-seated bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present,
but with mildly thickened leaflets and mildly increased
gradient. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-1-25**], the
distal septal hypokinesis appears to be new. The other findings
are similar (the severity of mitral regurgitaiton was
underestimated on the prior study).
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to clarify
the mitral valve morphology and severity of mitral
regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9950**] was tarnsfered from rehab after a fall. In the ED
she arrived with left leg shorter on physical exam and in pain.
Her vital signs were VS 96.0 96/50 71 18 94% RA. Her hematocit
was 32.3, WBC 11.5, INR of 1.4 and creatinine 1.1. An X-ray of
the hip was taken and a fracture of the proximal shaft of the
femur was diagnosed. Orthopedics were consulted and she went to
the OR, where she had an open reduction and internal fixation
with an approximate blood loss of 1.4 L. In the OR she received
~1.5 L of fluid and 500 of 5% albumin and 2 pack RBCs. Patient
was transfered to the medical floor after surgery. Her vital
signs after the OR were 100.5 110/D 77 18 98% 3L with an HCT of
34.1.  Three hours later her hematocrit dropped to 31.1 and
patient became hypotensive with an SBP in the 70s. She
triggered, received 2 L of NS and was transfered to the ICU. She
received multiple IV fluid boluses, 3 U of RBCs and orthopedics
re-evaluated her. Ortho did not recommend going back to surgery.
Patient had blood cultures taken (no growth), urine analysis
that showed signs of UTI, she had a urine culture that grew E
coli resistant to ciprofloxacin; an CXR with RUL consolidation
that has been stable from the past. Patient was prophylactically
started on ciprofloxacin for a UTI on [**8-20**] and was changed to
nitrofurantoin when the sensitivities came back on [**8-22**].
Patient will need a 10 day course for compliacted UTI Patient
did not required pressor. Patient was monitored for 24 hours
with serial hematocrits and was stable. Patient's SBP was in the
90s and she was asymptomatic, then she was transfered to the
medicine floor.
In the medicine floor hematocrits were checked every 8 hours and
was stable between 34-36; pt's SBP was 90-110 mmHg. Foley and
central line (right IJ) were removed on [**8-22**] without
complications. Patient had pain in the surgical site only on
movement, but it was controlled with oxycodone. Physical therapy
worked with her and she recommended further therapy in
rehabilitation.
Patient was explained all the events with the help of a russian
interpreter and was discharged back to the rehab where she was
before.
