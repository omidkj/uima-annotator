Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVL, a-line

History of Present Illness:
patient is a 71 y/o F with PMH of ESRD on HD, recent broncial
hemorrhage, respiratory failure with trach, hx of multiple GI
bleeds, nonresponsive at baseline presenting from [**Hospital **] rehab
with coffee ground emesis and fever.

The son reports that patient has been vomitting over the past
month, nonbloody until this morning. She was brought in from
rehab for evaluation of this. patient is unable to give review
of systems. Per the notes from [**Hospital 100**] rehab: at 8pm [**11-3**] she was
febrile to 101.2, she was diaphoretic and clammy, was given
250cc NS BPs were 80s/40s. stable overnight until 545 AM, when
she had hypotension to 88/32 again, was diaphoretic. Aspiration
of Gtube feeds showed 500cc of coffee ground fluid.

Per interview with the son, she is alert and speaks when not
infected and her electrolytes are normal. She has been having
emesis 3-4 times a day for the past month. This is been slowly
improving with change in admisteration of aluminum hydroxide
(daily instead of TID). Her Ca has also been high the past few
days. Her emesis also appeared more brown the past day instead
of the color of tube fees.

In the ED, her vitals were Tmax 101.4, BP: 116-149/60-70 (left
arm), HR 60-80, 96% on 100% BiPAP. Gtube aspirated 300-400cc of
coffee ground material. She was lavaged 7-800cc water which was
persistently coffee ground. Access was very difficult given her
vasculopathy; IJ was attempted but unable to thread and
eventually a 3inch 18 guage angiocath was placed. She has a 20
guage in her left arm. She was given 10mg IM morphine,
vancomycin 1gm IV, zosyn 4.5 mgIV, Ativan 1m, 2L NS, protonix
80mg IV once. She was put in BIPAP for reasons unclear, but
possibly in the setting of morphine and ativan.
Also of note her pressure should be checked from her left arm.

abd: diffuse TTP, firm. hypoactive BS.

Pertinent Results:
[**2188-11-4**] CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The left lower
lobe is collapsed. There
are bilateral small pleural effusions. There is trace
pericardial fluid,
likely physiologic.

There are several segments of a bowel wall thickening, mucosal
enhancement,
and adjacent mesenteric edema, particularly at the distal ileum.
Some of
these bowel loops demonstrate pneumatosis.

The patient is post-resection of the right and the transverse
colon, with
ileocolic anastomosis. Small amount of perihepatic free fluid is
present.
Gallbladder is distended and contains numerous gallstones.
Kidneys are
atrophic. Pancreas and spleen are unremarkable. Gastrostomy tube
is in place.
There is no free air in the abdomen.

CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is diverticulosis of
the sigmoid
colon without evidence of acute diverticulitis. The uterus is
atrophic. There
is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The rectal wall
is thickened,
though may be in part due to nondistention.

Extensive vascular calcifications are noted in the abdomen and
pelvis. The
celiac axis and SMA are patent proximally, though there is
stenosis at the
origin of both vessels due to extensive atherosclerotic
calcification of the
abdominal aorta, which is normal in caliber. [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is not clearly
enhancing,
possibly secondary to atheroscleortic changes.

BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic
lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. Findings highly concerning for mesenteric ischemia and
ischemic bowel in
the SMA territory.

2. Small amount of ascites.

3. Bilateral small pleural effusion, left lower lobe collapse.

4. Cholelithiasis; gallbladder distention can be related to the
fasting
state.

[**2188-11-9**] CT chest/abd/pelvis
FINDINGS:

The right brachiocephalic vein is markedly attenuated. The right
common
jugular vein appears to be normal caliber. However, there is a
clot in the
common jugular vein, series 2, image 127, which is eccentrically
positioned
and occupies approximately 50% of the lumen. The takeoff of the
right
subclavian vein is not well seen; however, an attenuated right
subclavian vein
is identified as it courses through the axilla. A left internal
jugular
central line is identified. The left brachiocephalic vein, left
internal
jugular, and left subclavian vein appear to be normal caliber.
There are
diffuse atherosclerotic changes of the arterial vessels without
evidence of
significant thrombus. The superior vena cava is slightly
attenuated in
caliber. The central line coursing through the SVC terminates at
the
SVC/right atrial junction.

There is no significant pericardial effusion. There are moderate
bilateral
pleural effusions with subjacent atelectasis, which appear to be
increased in
size from prior study dated [**2188-11-4**]. Shotty
mediastinal adenopathy
is noted. The tracheobronchial anatomy appears normal. There is
tracheostomy
tube identified. Esophagus appears unremarkable.

There is a distended gallbladder, which measures high normal in
diameter, at
4.9 cm, but is slightly decreased in diameter since the prior
study. Multiple
calcified dependent gallstones are identified. There is mild
amount of
perihepatic and perisplenic fluid. There is no focal lesion
identified in the
spleen or liver. There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
There are
atrophic kidneys without evidence of hydronephrosis. The
pancreas appears
unremarkable.

There are atherosclerotic changes in the abdominal aorta, most
prominent at
series 2, image 60.

Patient is status post partial colonic resection and ileocolic
anastomosis. There are fluid filled loops of large and small
bowel with
air/fluid levels but no evidence of bowel wall thickening,
pneumotosis,
or acute transition point. There is free fluid in the right
lower quadrant as
well as the pouch of [**Location (un) **]. A gastrostomy tube is identified.
There is no
evidence of intraperitoneal free air. There is diverticulosis of
the sigmoid
colon. A right femoral venous line is identified.

There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Attenuated appearance of the right brachiocephalic vein with
poorly
delineated inflow from the right subclavian vein, possibly
representing
stenosis. Eccentric clot in a normal caliber common right
jugular vein.
Patent left brachiocephalic vein and SVC, with a left- sided
central venous
catheter coursing to the SVC/right atrial junction.
2. Ascites.
3. Increased bilateral effusions and bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis.
4. Findings suggestive of ileus, with no evidence of obstruction
or
pneumotosis.
5. Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis.
