Imaging
[**2177-3-26**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with overlying
atelectasis. Left
hilar/infrahilar opacity could reflect combination of effusion,
atelectasis
and consolidation, however an underlying mass is not excluded
and is of
concern. Recommend follow up to resolution. Chest CT with
intravenous contrast
would better evaluate for underlying mass.
2. COPD.
[**2177-3-26**] CT Chest
1. Findings are very concerning for a left lower lung mass with
lymphangitic spread and associated loculated left lower
effusion.
2. Diffuse mediastinal, hilar and axillary adenopathy is
concerning for
metastasis.
3. There is severe diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
4. Findings likely represent pulmonary arterial hypertension.
5. Diffuse severe coronary artery atherosclerotic
calcifications.
5. Scattered subcentimeter opacities in the left upper lung and
right lung apex may represent neoplastic, infectious or
inflammatory etiology.
[**2177-3-28**] Chest xray
Small left pleural effusion is re-accumulating. Consolidative
abnormality at the left lung base, unchanged. Left upper lobe
mass is difficult to see. Right lung grossly clear. Heart size
is normal. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39657**] is an 89 year old man with a 55 year smoking
history. He presented with new onset shortness of breath,
pleural effusion, and a mass concerning for lung cancer.
Hospital course by problem is below.
.
HYPOXIA / PULMONARY EFFUSION: A CT scan in the emergency
department revealed a loculated left pleural effusion and a mass
concerning for malignancy. He was treated with levofloxacin for
possible pneumonia. He had a thoracentesis the day after
admission which removed 1.8 L. After the procedure he developed
re-expansion pulmonary edema. He was briefly placed on a
non-rebreather. Later that evening his temperatures were
elevated to a Tmax of 100. The following morning he had
increasing oxygen requirements and was again placed on a non
rebreather. He was transferred to the MICU for further
management. His antibiotic coverage was expanded to vancomycin.
He continued to have difficulties with hypoxia. After
discussion, he stated he did not want to be intubated. He was
kept on a non-rebreather. He was seen by palliative care in the
ICU and decided to pursue hospice care. As his breath
