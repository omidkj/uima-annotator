Service:

In brief, the patient is a 73 year old male who was seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] for evaluation of a right upper lobe mass.
Biopsies showed nonsquamous cell cancer.  He has had
pulmonary rehabilitation times two visits and had shortness
of breath.  The patient is also status post Levaquin for
productive sputum and he underwent a head CT at an outside
hospital which was reportedly negative for any metastatic
disease.  He now is admitted postoperatively after undergoing
right upper lobe wedge resection for non small cell lung
carcinoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, having home O2 requirement
times 2-3 years, status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2188**]
with residual mild left hemiparesis and a mild coronary
artery disease and hypertension.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Hydrochlorothiazide, Cozaar, Flovent,
albuterol nebulizers.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs with stable vital signs,
saturation 96% on nasal cannula oxygen.  He is awake, alert.
The heart was regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were with
slightly coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender.  Extremities were warm.  No cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  The patient underwent right upper lobe wedge
resection on [**2195-7-29**].  He was extubated in the Operating
Room but required reintubation due to hypoxia and
hypoventilation.  The patient was then transferred to the
Post Anesthesia Care Unit, intubated in the Post Anesthesia
Care Unit.  He was extubated after which he again experienced
some respiratory distress.  This time the patient was treated
with biPAP.  Arterial blood gases at that time noted for PCO2
of 80 and low PO2 also.  The patient was then transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit with a biPAP mask and followed very
closely.  Over time, his arterial blood gases began to
improve until finally his PCO2 had normalized to his baseline
in the 60's and PO2 and oxygen saturation had also improved.
He was transferred out the Intensive Care Unit on
postoperative day one in stable condition.

Physical Therapy was also consulted and he was noted to be
ambulating extremely well.  On postoperative day number two,
the patient remained stable, remained afebrile.  He remained
in his baseline preoperative atrial fibrillation rhythm and
blood pressure was controlled.  His saturations were also
controlled with saturating 92% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
The patient underwent chest x-ray which looked stable.  Chest
tubes were removed and epidural and Foley catheter was also
removed.  The patient is currently doing extremely well and
will likely be discharged on postoperative day three, on
[**2195-8-1**] with home O2 and instructions to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Right upper lobe mass, status post
right upper lobe wedge resection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypertension, atrial fibrillation, mild coronary artery
disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Home medications plus Percocet [**12-9**]
p.o. q.6h. p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o. q. day while taking
Percocet and home O2.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should continue with his
home O2 as previously prescribed.  The patient should
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in approximately one week, next
Thursday.
