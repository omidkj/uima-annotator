Abdominal Pain

ERCP

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an 87-year-old man with a previous history
of a spindle cell myoepithelial tumor involving the right
parotid gland. In addition, he has myelodysplastic disorder,
which is transforming to leukemia. He was recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 62739**] for altered mental status and febrile
neutropenia. No clear cause for his altered mental was found and
he had a negative LP and MRI. It eventually spontaneously
improved. He was initially treated with Vanc/CTX/Amp/Acyclovir
but was changed to cefepime/vanc on when the LP was negative.
D/C'd on 7 day course of Levofloxacin for febrile neutropenia
with no clear source.
.
He now returns with severe epigastric pain since this morning
with associated profuse vomitting and diarrhea. He could no
characterize the vomit. Denies any aggravating or alleviating
symptoms. States he may have had a somewhat similar pain "a
while ago". Denies HA, visual changes, CP, SOB, palpitations,
F/C, dysuria, focal weakness, numbness or tingling.
.
Review of systems is otherwise negative.
.
In the emergency department, initial VS were: 97.3, 66, 136/66,
16, 100% RA. An initial CT scan showed signs concerning for
pancreatitis. He remained afebrile but given his persistent
neutropenia and a lactate of 4.6, he was given cefepime, vanco,
and clindamycin. He remained HD but received a total of 3L NS.
He was also treated for a K+ of 5.4 with Calcium gluconate, 10
units of insulin, and 1 amp D50.
The patient also had some brief ([**6-2**] sec) of asymptomatic
bradycardia to the 30s to 40s. BP remained stable and no
intervention given. He is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care
and monitoring


Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (as per previous notes): Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
first evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**4-5**], [**2181**]. He first noticed a soft-tissue mass in front of his
right ear in [**2180-12-23**]. The painless mass grew in size so a
CT head was done on [**2181-1-19**], which was notable for a 2
cm enhancing mass in the superficial lobe of the right parotid
gland. He underwent a superficial parotidectomy on [**2181-2-5**]. Pathology was consistent with a 3.2 cm spindle cell
myoepithelial carcinoma focally extending into the surrounding
fibroadipose tissue. It was less than 1 mm from the inked
margin. It was in the background of a residual pleomorphic
adenoma. He then started radiation, but unfortunately the mass
continued to increase in size during radiation. It was
re-biopsied on [**2181-3-26**], and found to be consistent with
mild pleomorphic spindle cells. He restarted radiation therapy
on [**2181-4-2**]. The decision at that time was to start
concurrent Erbitux for radiosensitization. This was started on
[**2181-4-6**]. He continued Erbitux through [**2181-5-4**], and
completed radiation on [**2181-5-18**]. On [**2181-5-25**], he went
back to the OR and underwent right anterolateral thigh flap to
the right facial and temporal region and multiple facial nerve
grafts after undergoing total parotidectomy, with sacrifice of
the facial nerve and subtotal right auriculectomy and a right
modified radical neck dissection. Pathology was notable for a
tumor which measured 2.4 cm in greatest dimension in the
cartilage of the external ear canal. LVI was not seen. Pathology
seemed consistent with but not completely compatible with his
previous myoepithelial carcinoma, although the thought was this
difference was secondary to radiation. No malignancy was
identified in 10 lymph nodes. He was seen in follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2181-8-17**]. At that time, he remained persistently
pancytopenic and a concern for myelodysplastic syndrome was
raised. Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his family wanted to defer a bone
marrow biopsy at that time. He had a blood transfusion on
[**2181-10-3**], at [**Location (un) 620**]. On [**2181-10-17**], he
underwent a revision flap with right myocutaneous facial flap,
right lower lid repair. Surgery was uncomplicated. On [**12-14**], [**2181**], he underwent further revision with a split-thickness
skin graft external auditory canal. After creation of the
external auditory canal with adjacent tissue of the thigh flap,
he developed redness and drainage at the site of thigh flap on
[**2181-12-31**]. This was felt to be adequately treated with
topical antibiotics. He started Decitabine therapy on [**2182-2-26**] and
has received 2 cycles.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Postoperative DVT. LLE DVT following original parotid mass
resection in [**2181-1-23**]. Thrombus extended from the
inferior portions of the superficial femoral vein to the entire

popliteal vein and superior portions of the left saphenous vein

with nonocclusive thrombus in the mid superficial femoral vein.

Initially, patient was treated with Lovenox as a bridge to
Coumadin. Lupus anticoagulant and cardiolipin antibodies were
sent at that time per the discharge summary. It was later
reported LA was
positive. Coumadin discontinued [**2182-2-15**] due to ongoing
thrombocytopenia.
2. CHF. He most recently had an EF of 35%.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of coronary artery disease-- no history of MI or
CABG, . Has severe inferior hypokinesis, and less severe
hypokinesis in the anterior/anterolateral/anteroseptal walls on
echo ([**5-31**]).
5. BPH.
6. Facial cellulitis
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
- Extensive surgery and reconstruction related to his parotid
gland tumor (as above). He is also status post appendectomy and
TURP.

Social History:
He has a history of tobacco use. He smoked 3
packs a day for 15 to 20 years approximately 45 years ago. He
rarely drinks wine. He lives with his wife.
