Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 20756**] was admitted for acute shortness of breath.  After
and initial evaluation, he was felt to be septic, possibly from
his hemodialysis line, and was started on vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and metronidazole were initiated, the patient had a
central line placed, and was given IV fluid boluses to maintain
his blood pressure.  He was intubated for respiratory failure.
When IV fluids proved insufficient to support a MAP greater than
65, pressors were started, first norepinephrine and subsequently
vasopressin and phenylephrine.  The patient also developed a
number of rhythm abnormalities, including second degree heart
block and ventricular tachycardia, and frequently alternated
between these.
He was coded multiple times during the night of his admission,
with episodes marked by bradycardia and sudden, severe drops in
blood pressure (into the 30's and 40's systolic).  He generally
responded to fluids and increased pressors, but the overall
trend was worsening hemodynamics despite increasingly aggresive
resuscitation.  He was eventually started on dopamine in
addition to the aforementioned pressor agents, yet he continued
to clinically decompensate with worsening bp.  His family, who'd
been involved and apprised of the situation throughout the
morning, was contact[**Name (NI) **] and decided to make him comfort measures
only.  Once the pressors and ventilatory support were withdrawn,
he quickly expired.
