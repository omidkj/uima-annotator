Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
68 y/o F with no medical care x years, who called EMS tonight
c/o shortness of breath. Upon their arrival, she was found to be
agonal breathing, foaming at the nose/mouth, and an oxygen
saturation of 80%. (Per report from ED resident, as there are no
EMS records available.) She was intubated by EMS and brought to
[**Hospital3 3583**]. At [**Hospital1 46**], she was hemodynamically stable (sbp
120s-140s, pulse 100s). She was given versed 2 mg, narcan 2 mg,
morphine 4 mg, and ativan 1 mg. Per our ED resident, she was
also given lasix 40 mg and had 800 cc UOP at [**Hospital1 46**] but this is
not in their records. She had an EKG that demonstrated a LBBB,
and so she was Medflighted to [**Hospital1 **] for possible cardiac
intervention. She also received vecuronium at some point.
.
In our ED, her vitals were: 99.4, 115/75, 113. Her inital vent
settings were not recorded, but her oxygen saturation was
between 94 and 98% on 100% FiO2. She required a PEEP of 15. She
was noted to have a UTI on her UA and was given vanco,
levofloxacin, and flagyl. She was also given sedation with
versed. She had a bedside echo by the ED resident which
reportedly showed a hyperdynamic state.
.
Upon discussion with her daughter, she reports that the pt is a
[**Doctor First Name **] Scientist and has not seen a doctor for over 20 years
secondary to her religious preferences. Her daughter states the
pt has been more short of breath lately and has been complaining
of weakness and dizziness, as well as insomnia. This has been
going on for a matter of months. Did not complain of chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, abd pain per daughter. [**Name (NI) **] daughter saw her
yesterday [**2141-2-7**] and noted that her mom was able to get around
the house, etc.


Past Medical History:
unknown as pt has not seen physician in over 20 years. Per
daughter, she shattered her patella a few years ago and refused
surgical intervention at that time.

Social History:
Lives by herself. Works as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Science Practitioner.
Used to smoke tobacco, daughter unsure how much, quit 20 years
ago. No EtOH use. Divorced.

Family History:
noncontributory per daughter

HEENT: pupils 2 mm and nonreactive bilaterally, dried blood on
face
Neck: JVD difficult to visualize
Lungs: inspiratory crackles at left base, good air movement, no
wheezing
CV: tachycardic, distant heart sounds, no murmur
Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended, +bs. + Vaginal prolapse with
some skin breakdown.
Ext: trace to 1+ pitting lower extremity edema bilaterally to

ECHO on [**2141-2-8**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the septum and
apex. The basal half oof the inferiuor wall is akinetic with an
inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be
determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no

echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CXR on [**2141-2-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  High position of the endotracheal tube tip situated at the
thoracic inlet.
2.  Severe interstitial pulmonary edema.

LENI on [**2141-2-8**]:


Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o F w/no medical care who called EMS today for respiratory
distress. Currently requiring large amounts of support from the
ventilator.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Given the clinical findings of
pulmonary edema on CXR, peripheral edema on physical exam, this
is likely due to congestive heart failure. It is unclear if this
is flash pulmonary edema (due to myocardial ischemia, valvular
dysfunction) vs. worsening of chronic pulmonary edema, as her
daughter reports shortness of breath that has been going on x
months. Also has BNP over 3000 but could be R heart strain in
setting of hypoxic resp failure. Given clinical hx, the patient
was treated as if she was in CHF. An echo was pefromed which
revealed poor EF.  Extubated without event, and no longer has
oxygen requirement.  The patient was able to be weaned off of
oxygen and was doing well on room air upon discharge.
.
# CArdiac:
LVEF = 20%.  Slightly elevated troponins on admission likely due
to CHF exacerbation.  LBBB is concerning if it's new, but since
we have nothing to compare and first set of enzymes are
negative, it's likely old. The patient Diuresed well on
furosemide.   She was started aspirin given new left bundle.
Also noted to have A. fib with RVR while in the MICU and started
on metoprolol.  The patient diuresed well on IV lasix and her
lung exam improved.  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed non-occlusive disease, no
interventions were done.  The patient was started on po lasix,
toprol xl and lisinopril.
.
# Hypotension: Likely due to CHF, as appears total body volume
overloaded on initial exam. The patient had a normal lactate
which is reassuring, and her mental status is also good as she
can follow commands, etc. She did not require pressors and was
called out of the unit.  The patient's hypotension resolved
while on the floor and was able to tolerate bp meds for cardiac
protection.
.
# Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. UA has no protein in it, to
suggest chronic nephropathy, ? due to diabetes. [**Month (only) 116**] be due to
hypoperfusion from poor forward flow secondary to ATN. Sediment
only showed WBCs, no casts.  The patient's creatinine clearance
had a nadir of 1.9 upon discharge.  This should be her baseline
creatinine function
.
# DM: FS in 300s upon arriving to ICU, so has diabetes. The pt
was on insulin sliding scale, FS QID but did not require further
insulin during her stay. The HgAIC was normal. This was likely
as stress reponse.
.
# UTI: The patient was treated for a 7 day course of
ciprofloxacin.  She had no urinary symptoms upon discharge.
.
# Restless legs:  The pt received ativan prn for restless leg
syndrome.  The patient was instructed to follow up with a pcp
for further care.
