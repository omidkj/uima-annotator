Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP


History of Present Illness:
80 yo F with h/o MI in [**2-/2172**], RA on steroids (10mg daily) long
term, recurrent UTI's with urosepsis w/ resistant organisms (?
VRE and pseudomonas resistent to cipro), who had a recent
hospital admission on [**7-21**] for AMS, hypercarbia (Pc02:
100) requiring intubation and UTI for which she was treated for
with 14 day course of cefepime. She was discharge back to her
[**Hospital1 1501**] and was found to have AMS with O2sat 76% on RA. She was then
sent to the ED where her O2 sat was 94% on RA her ABG showed pH
7.40/ pCO2 56/pO2 56/ HCO3 36. Her vitals were T98, HR84,
BP105/51, RR18. Labs were notable for WBC of 13.8 with 90%
PMN's, BUN of 41, Cr of 2.3, glucose of 158, few bacteria in her
urine with small amounts of blood and luekocyte esterase, and 3
wbc's. She was then admitted to the floor for further eval. This
morning she was found to be very lethargic and and shaking.
Neurology was called for eval for ? stroke, she had Head CT that
showed no IC process. She had a repeat ABG that showed pH 7.28/
pCO2
75/pO2 114/ HCO3 37 not on oxygen. She was then sent to the
floor for acute respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia for bipap.
During her prior admission, pt refused to used bipap and had
decided to be DNR/DNI. However during her AMS today her daughter
who is her HCP decided to reverse her code DNI and okay to
resuscitate. So, she was transferred to the MICU for further
management.
She was placed on bipap on arrival to the MICU, she was having
periods of apnea, sating well in the upper 90s%. She then became
more alert. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain an ABG prior
to her being d/ced from BIPAP.
.
Of note, during her last admssion she also presented with AMS
which was at the time atributed to hypercarbia and infection.
Her hypercarbia was originally thought to be due to baseline
obstructive disease in setting of hypoventilation from
significant AMS from recieiving tramadol and quinolone and a
UTI. She also would desat in the evening and had observed
periods of apnea while sleeping, but she refused to use BIPAP.
We were also able to obtain records from [**Hospital3 2005**] and it
was reported that pt had PFTs which were consistent with
obstructive pattern which was attributed to scoliosis. However
there were no numbers reported. She had an ECHO on [**6-26**] that
showed pulm hypertension. So given her hx of RA and concern for
interstial [**Last Name **] problem, she had high resolution CT which showed
no evidence of interstitial lung disease and possible
tracheobronchomalacia, severity indeterminate.
.
Her MICU course is as follows: On [**7-8**] she was on BiPAP with
periods of apnea ([**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]) ameliorated with increased
PEEP. Her code status was reversed to FULL. On [**7-9**] she continued
on BiPAP and completed her course of cefepime. Laboratories
appeared to indicate prerenal azotemia and she was run TBB even
with fluids as respiratory status allowed. While on BiPAP her BP
dropped at one point, ABG indicating hypercarbia and acidemia
during which she was minimally responsive. She responded to
fluid bolus and became alert again. On [**7-10**] she was kept TBB even
and Renal added sevelamer prn for phos > 6. She revisited code
status with her proxy (daughter) and became DNR/ok to intubate.
On [**7-11**] she was transferred to medicine sating 90s on RA and
requiring BiPAP for periods of napping due to persistent bouts
of hypercarbia.
.
On arrival to the floor, VS were 96.3  80-90  SBP 106-130 RR
15-20  96%RA.  Her mental status was clear, she was alert and
oriented and tolerating BiPAP well with no shortness of breath
or chest pain.

IMAGING
[**2172-7-7**]:
INDICATION: COPD.

COMPARISON: [**2172-6-30**].

PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median
sternotomy,
CABG, and mitral valve replacement. The heart size is unchanged.
The aorta
is slightly tortuous and diffusely calcified. There is evidence
of mild
pulmonary edema, which is similar when compared to the prior
study. Right
PICC tip terminates in the SVC. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are
unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous
abnormalities are
visualized. Epicardial leads are again demonstrated.

IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
effusions, not
significantly changed when compared to the prior exam.
