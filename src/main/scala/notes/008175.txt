Chief Complaint:
L hand and arm numbness/weakness

none

History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 78 yo M with PVD s/p CEA
and right internal carotid artery stenting in [**2131**], s/p left
iliac and left renal artery stent, [**Hospital **] transfered from OSH for
left arm numbness. The patient reports that he awoke yesterday
with numbness in his entire left hand, left fingers curled,
difficulty moving his left arm and poor coordination with his
left arm. Specifically, he had numbness and an inability to hold
his pants while trying to button them. These symptoms lasted
several minutes but resolved on arrival at the ED. They waxed
and waned for the next two days during his admission. He denied
any blurred vision, no slurred speech, no drooling, no numbness
or weakness in any other ext, no imbalance, no confusion. He did
endorse transient numbness in left upper lift and left side of
his tonque that lasted several minutes, occured once and did not
return.
.
At the outside hospital, he was ruled out for MI. A neurology
consult was obtained and was concered for acute stroke vs right
carotid stent dysfunction w/impaired cerebral perfusion. He had
a head CT, which showed no hemorrhage or acute stroke. A BP
range of 150-160 was recommended to avoid relative
hypoperfusion. [**Name2 (NI) 6**] MRI and echo were recommended but not
performed due to concerns of safety with his stents and lack of
time prior to transfer respectively.
.
The patient has a history of concern for TIA. He had carotid
artery tenting in [**2131**] for symptoms of UE numbness. Prior to the
revascularization procedure he had two episodes of right sided
numbness and tingling. It was thought that he had a symptomatic
[**Doctor First Name 3098**] lesion by symptoms as well as ultrasound. However,
angiography revealed non-significant disease in the left carotid
system with an 80% lesion in the right. Therefore, the [**Country **] was
stented in 2/[**2131**].

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  78 yo M with PVD s/p CEA and right
internal carotid artery stenting in [**2131**], s/p left iliac and
left renal artery stent, [**Hospital **] transfered from OSH for left arm
numbness and weakness thought to be a subcortical stroke.  No
further progession overnight ([**2132-9-8**]).
.
# Left arm numbness:
Neuro consulted who found L hand weakness and a small L
pronator/parietal drift but no other parietal signs.  This would
be consistent with an embolic stroke to the R subcortical area.
 No MRI secondary to pt too anxious and refuses MRI. R CCA
disease is likely the source. Echo study neg for ASD or
thrombus. Pt had multiple transient episodes of L hand
numbness/weakness and left upper lip numbness during
hospitalization.  Pt gained more strength in left arm/hand
during hospitalization. BP goal 140-160 for good brain perfusion
and amlodipine, b-blocker, and lisinopril held during admission.
Pt had one episode of decreased BP and was given bolus and laid
flat.  He was on hep drip with goal PPT 60-70 to decrease sx.
Patient was continued on ASA and plavix. Pt to have common
carotid stent placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and then transferred to CCU.
Procedure occured without complication.
.
In CCU, Pt's systolic blood pressure was maintained in the 110
to 145 range with nitro drip. This was discontinued prior to
discharge and pt maintained his pressures in this range even
after ambulating.  Neuro exam notable for only slight weakness
of LUE compared to RUE.
.
#. CAD: Patient is s/p balloon angioplasty years ago and MI
ruled out at OSH.  He was continued on Aspirin 325 mg Tablet but
b-blocker and Ace held during admission to allow for better
perfusion to the brain.  Patient was continued on atorvastatin.
Atenolol restarted on day of discharge.
.
# Anxiety:  Patient was continued on ativan, olanzapine, and
paroxetine.  He refused MRI while in hospital to look for stroke
secondary to anxiety.
.
# BPH: Pt continued on finasteride
.
#. Code: full confirmed with patient

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted from an OSH with new symptoms of numbness and
weakness in the left hand that came and went.  You also had
transient numbness of your left upper lip and left tongue.
Neurology came and saw you and you likely had a right
subcortical stroke.  We would normally do an MRI but you refused
because it makes you too anxious to be in an enclosed space. We
did a CT scan of your head and found no bleed or evidence of
tumor.  We did a CT angio and an ultrasound of your neck
vessels.  You had some stenosis and plaue in your right common
carotid artery.  You were started on IV heparin to hopefully
improve your transient symptoms.  You were taken to the cath lab
and a stent was placed in your right common carotid artery.
There were no complications.  Some of your blood pressure
medicines have been held, you should discuss restarting them
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week.

If you develop an inability to speak or move normally you should
return to the hospital immediately.

Followup Instructions:
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]: 1:45pm
