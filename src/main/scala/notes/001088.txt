ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY:
From OMR admission note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] is a 69-year-old woman with a past medical history
significant for aortic valvular replacement for aortic stenosis
in [**2143**] and venous occlusion of the retinal vein in [**10/2144**], who
presented on [**2145-1-27**] to the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 620**] campus with
increasing fatigue and shortness of breath. She had no fevers,
chills, or night sweats, but noted some easy bruising. She also
had some visual changes with diplopia and blurry vision due to
recent retinal vein occlusion. At [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] was
found of a white blood count of 300,000 with 94% blasts. She was
started on IV fluids with
bicarbonate and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Flow cytometry on [**2145-1-27**] from her peripheral blood showed a
majority of the cells in the CD45 intermediate low side scatter
blast region. The cells expressed CD33 along with dim CD4 and
dim CD19. Cells were negative for CD34 and HLA-DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 20282**] were
negative for other myeloid markers including CD13, CD14, CD15,
CD41, CD64, glycolphorin, CD17. Immunophenotyping findings were
consistent with involvement by acute myeloid leukemia with a
peripheral smear revealing cup-like nuclei. Cytogenetics were
notable for FLT3 and NPM positivity. Echocardiogram showed a
left ejection fraction of greater than 65%. Because of her high
white count, Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] leukophoresis and initially
received hydroxyurea. On [**2145-1-28**], she was initiated on 7 and
3 induction regimen with idarubicin and ara-C. Her course was
complicated by fever and neutropenia. She also was noted for a
drop in her ejection fraction to 20-25% on [**2145-2-14**], which was
felt due to anthracycline use. She has been managed medically
initially with spironolactone, furosemide, lisinopril, and
metoprolol and is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP as an outpatient. She is currently on spironolactone,
furosemide, diovan, and metoprolol. Her lisinopril was
discontinued due to cough which has since resolved. Ms. [**Known lastname 20283**]
course was complicated by her deconditioning and depression
regarding her diagnosis and conditioning. She was followed by
psychiatry while an inpatient and was discharged on [**2145-3-3**]
to [**Hospital1 **] House Rehabilitation in order to improve her strength
before moving forward with further therapy. Her cardiomyopathy
also limited her ability to receive further chemotherapy.

As an outpatient, Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] was noted for a drop in her platelet
count. She had noted a superficial saphenous vein clot and was
started on Lovenox approximately two weeks prior to this. Her
Lovenox had been stopped due to her decreasing platelet count.
However, she was found to have a positive HIT antibody and was
admitted for initiation of Argatroban therapy on [**2145-3-22**].
Followup testing with serotonin releasing assay was negative,
thereby making HIT diagnosis unlikely. It was decided to stop
Argatroban. She had a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy
done on [**2145-3-18**] and [**2145-3-26**], both showing no evidence for
patient's known leukemia, although the specimen on [**2145-3-26**]
showed megakaryocytic hypoplasia. Repeat testing for FLT3
mutation and NPM mutation were sent on [**2145-3-27**] and were
negative. Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] was further evaluated with a repeat
ultrasound which continued to shows a superficial clot in the
saphenous vein, but there was no evidence for deep vein
thrombosis, so she did not require any further anticoagultion,
which would have been difficult as her platelet count has
remained low. She also was reevaluated with echocardiogram which
showed improvement in her left ventricular ejection fraction to
50-55%. Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] was initially discharged to home on
[**2145-3-31**], but fell. She was readmitted overnight. CT of the
head was negative, and she was discharged to [**Location (un) 1036**] for
further rehabilitation. She has been followed in the outpatient
setting for transfusion support.

Over the past 4 - 6 weeks, Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] has received periodic
transfusion support but her counts have slowly recovered. She
had a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2145-4-23**] which
showed a hypocellular erythroid dominant bone marrow with
trilineage hematopoiesis whit no evidence for acute leukemia.
Her FLT3 mutation and NPM mutation have remained negative. Ms.
[**Known lastname 20281**] has also been transitioned to home with physical therapy.
She has increased her strength and conditioning and remains
independent in her care and is walking without issues. She has
increased her activity. This is also in the setting of improved
cardiomyopathy. Because of her known mutations, she is at high
risk for recurrent leukemia and is in need of n allogeneic
transplant. She is being admitted today for her nonmyeloablative
allogeneic double cord transplant with Fludarabine, Melphalan
and ATG conditioning regimen.
