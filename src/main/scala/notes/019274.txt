Fever, Delerium, UTI, Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with frequent UTIs in the past presents with fever
and altered mental status for 3 days. She recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-23**] after PVD/chronic leg ulcer work-up and was
found to have an occluded L popliteal artery which was not
revascularized due to medical stability and anesthesia. She has
been at [**Hospital3 **] center until 3 days prior to
re-admission to [**Hospital1 18**].

Her course at [**Hospital1 100**] was complicated by C.diff colitis and was
placed on po vancomycin (unclear if she failed Flagyl). Per her
daughter [**Name (NI) **], the patient's only symptoms were decreased
mental status and fevers. She did not notice any cough until in
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and pt has not been talking much at all so it has
been hard to assess her complaints. Her baseline since the
admission in [**1-9**] has been deteriorating. She used to walk and
converse, and follwed basic commands, but is now hardly able to
follow the simplest commands.
.
ED COURSE: Initially, in [**Name (NI) **], pt was febrile to 102.2 and
hypotensive with a BP of 86/42 and tachypneic to 34 and 93% on
4L via NC. She was given Ceftriaxone 1g for her positive UA and
and pneumonia, she also received vancomycin 1gm, and
levofloxacin 500mg iv was ordered but not yet received. Pt also
received 2L of NS in the ED for Na 152 and hypovolemia.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2156-2-22**] 11:29 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology including
hemorrhage or edema.
2. Stable changes of age appropriate atrophy and chronic
microvascular ischemia.
.
AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST: A drainage catheter projects over the
left upper abdominal quadrant. Several right abdominal surgical
clips are seen. Borderline cardiomegaly is unchanged. The aorta
is mildly calcified and folded. Increased left retrocardiac
peribronchial nodular infiltration may present aspiration or
evolving pneumonia. The right lung is grossly clear. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The osseous structures are
stable. IMPRESSION: Increased left retrocardiac peribronchial
nodular infiltration, which may represent aspiration or evolving
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Altered mental status)
According to the patient's daughter, she had been less
interactive at rehab prior to admission. She underwent a CT of
her head which was unremarkable. Her mental status changes were
thought to be multifactorial, likely related to electrolyte
disturbance, infection, recent fall with subdural hematoma --
and subsequent to her PEA arrest possibly anoxic injury.

2. PEA arrest)
Ms. [**Known lastname 31102**] had a PEA arrest on [**2-24**]. She was treated with
epinephrine and atropine a right femoral line was placed, and
she was intubated. Food particles were noted in the airway at
intubation, suggestive of an aspiration event. She was
subsequently transferred to the ICU for further monitoring and
evaluation. Her troponins were mildly elevated at 0.13 post
resuscitation, thought secondary to chest compressions. LENIs
were done as part of PE workup and were negative.

3. Aspiration pneumonia
CXR at admission showed possible infiltrate, and she was treated
empirically with vancomycin and cefepime. Cefepime was changed
to meropenem subsequently on [**3-1**] after she developed a new
fever to 101.6.  The patient continued to display symptoms of
aspiration PNA/hospital-acquired pneumonia during her hospital
course for which she was traeted with vancomycin and
ceftazadime.

4. Dysphagia)Given her history of dysphagia she was kept NPO and
continued tube feeds. Her G tube was replaced on [**3-3**] as her
initial tube was no longer flushing.

5. Urinary tract infection)
She received ceftriaxone empirically in the ED on [**2-23**] but was
subsequently changed to cefepime. Urine cultures from admission
came back positive for quino
