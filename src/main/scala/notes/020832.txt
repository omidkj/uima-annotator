shortness of breath, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2131-9-19**] Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
81 yo M w/ history of DMII, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
and CRI who presented with SOB. Pt reports being physically
quite active his entire life, but noted increasing SOB and DOE
over the past 5 years. Yesterday, he was taking out the trash
and noted worsened DOE and non-radiating chest tightness while
lifting the trash bin and walking down the street. Denies
palpitations, nausea, vomiting, LOC. Never experienced this
chest tightness before. Chest tightness resolved with rest. Pt
took no medications to palliate his symptoms, but reports
orthopnea that night (slept in his chair). Pt was concerned
about these symptoms and presented to OSH ED the next AM. At
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], VS were 99.5 100 115/78 18 98% on 2 L NC. He was
noted to be in new AF w/ RVR with HRs in 140's and CHF (BNP
2200). He was also found to have an NSTEMI (Trop-T 0.55 => 0.15,
EKG with minor ST depressions). He remained hemodynamically
stable. He received Lasix 40 mg IV x1, potassium chloride 20 mEq
x1, was started on nitro gtt, 15mg cardizem x1. He was also
noted to have occasional episodes of bradycardia btw 20-30's. He
was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care and
admission to the cardiology service.

Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
[**9-19**] Cath: 1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant
system revealed severe 3 vessel coronary disease poorly suitable
for PCI. The LMCA had mild disease. The LAD had a 70% stenosis
after D2. D1 had a proximal stenosis up to 70% and D2 had a
proximal 70% stenosis as well. The LCX had a small OM1 with a
proximal 70% stenosis and another small OM2 with a proximal 80%
stenosis. The RCA had diffuse mild disease with severe
calcification. There was a focal mid lesion up to 90% stenotic
with distal lesions with an 80% stenosis in the RPDA and RPL. 2.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated systemic arterial
pressure with an SBP of 175 mm Hg. The LVEDP was severely
elevated at 30 mm Hg indicative of diastolic dysfunction. There
was no evidence of aortic stenosis with pullback across the
aortic valve. 3. Left ventriculography was deferred. [**9-21**]
Carotid U/S: Significant left-sided plaque with 70-79% carotid
stenosis. Of note, the technologist felt that there was mobile
plaque in the common carotid bulb. This could not be visualized
based on scanned images. On the right there is less than 40%
carotid stenosis.
[**9-21**] Chest CT: 1. Extensive atherosclerosis as described.
Questionable focal dissection of upper abdominal/lower thoracic
aorta. Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT or MRA is
recommended or comparison to prior studies if available. 2. Left
kidney cysts, one of them calcified. 3. Bilateral pleural
effusions, improved right lower lobe consolidation. 4. Two focal
ground-glass opacities in the right lower lobe, 4:125, and in
the right upper lobe as described, may represent areas of
infection, but followup in three months for documentation of
complete resolution is highly recommended. 5. Degenerative
changes of thoracic spine, extensive, with no evidence of
metastasis.
[**10-1**] Abd CT: 1. Stable left retroperitoneal hemorrhage, some
interval contraction is seen. 2. Aneurysmal dilation of the
infrarenal abdominal aortic.
[**10-2**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or
the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of
the results on [**Known firstname 429**] [**Known lastname **] at 12noon. Post_Bypass: Preserved
biventricular systolic function. LVEF 55%. Otherwise, exam is
unchanged from pre bypass.
[**10-4**] Head CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, mass
effect, or large acute territorial infarction. Areas of low
attenuation are visualized in the subcortical and
periventricular white matter, likely consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. Dense arteriosclerotic
calcifications are demonstrated in the carotid siphons and in
the vertebral arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo M with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN, HLD,
DM, and PVD who presented to the hospital with shortness of
breath and chest tightness, found to have new onset CHF and
transient in AF w/ RVR. Was found to have ischemic congestive
heart failure (Grade I Diastolic HF EF > 55%) and 3VD on cardiac
cath. Patient was medically managed, including diureses, and
awaited CABG. During pre-operative work-up, hospital course was
complicated by acute on chronic renal failure and a spontaneous
L-sided RP bleed. Underwent carotid U/S pre-op which revealed
70-70% stenosis of left carotid. Both of those complications
resolved and the patient was taken to the operating room on
[**10-2**] for a coronary artery bypass graft x 6 and left carotid
endarterectomy. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-op day two chest tubes were removed. Patient had some
right-sided weakness along with altered mental status and
underwent Head CT. CT revealed no evidence of CVA. Also on
post-op day two he had episodes of atrial fibrillation and was
started on Amiodarone and Coumadin. He remained on Neo for BP
support for several days but on was eventually weaned and
started on beta-blockers. Epicardial pacing wires were removed
per protocol. His weakness and mental status improved and on
post-op day six he was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care. During his post-op course he worke
