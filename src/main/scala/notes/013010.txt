Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbic respiratory failure and bradycardia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arrived to hospital intubated ([**6-9**]).
Extubation ([**6-10**]).
Re-intubation ([**6-11**]).
Bronchoscopy ([**6-11**]).
PICC-line placement ([**6-12**]).

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o man with PMHx of COPD on 2L home O2 and CHF who
presented on [**6-8**] to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with 2 days of productive cough,
shortness of breath, and lethargy. He was tachypneic in the 30s
with T 100.9, BP 130/80 and sating in low 90s on 5L NC. He was
given solumderol 125mg IV, duonebs, Vancomycin, Levaquin and
placed on BIPAP prior to admission to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ICU. While
in ICU the patient was getting tired on the BiPAP without
improvement of his O2 sats and he was intubated and on the
morning of [**6-9**]. He had previous evaluation for bradycardia but
per PCP's office and an admission for CP where he was ruled out
for an MI. Per report, the metoprolol dose was decreased.  Pt
was noted to have pauses of [**5-13**] seconds and bradycardia with
rates in the 30-40s. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and possible pacemaker.

On arrival to the ICU, patient was intubated and sedated, not
responding to commands. Family was at bedside and provided the
additional history of his general lethargy preceding this
admission. Patient has been sleeping most of day, complaining of
decreased appetite and needing to increase his home O2. He has
never been intubated before and moved here from FLA one year
ago. He lives in an [**Hospital3 **] with his wife and denies any
sick contacts.

Review of systems: Per wife, no fevers, diarrhea, abd pain,
chest pain or lightheadedness. He has cough at baseline and has
been requiring increased home O2. General lethary without focal
complaint.

Imaging Studies:
CXR ([**2189-6-9**])
FINDINGS: No previous images. Endotracheal tube tip lies
approximately 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends
into the stomach. Left IJ
catheter extends to about the junction of the left
brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava.
There is patchy opacification at the right base consistent with
the clinical impression of pneumonia. There may be similar,
though much less prominent, changes on the left. Mild prominence
of the hilar regions is seen bilaterally of uncertain
significance and etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
92-y/o-man with past medical history of COPD on home O2 who
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory distress and PNA, now
s/p intubation for PNA with bradycardia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for EP evaluation.

# Respiratory Failure. Mixed hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
failure given underling COPD with possible excaberation and new
RML PNA. Pt was initially treated with BiPAP but tired out with
rising pCO2. He was intubated on the morning of transfer (prior
to transfer) with resulting improvement in respiratory acidosis.
His pneumonia was covered broadly with vancomycin, cefepime, and
doxycycline (he completed an 8-day course) and he was started on
a prolonged steroid taper (methylprednisolone 60 mg x6 days
switched over to prednisone on hospital day 7). He was extubated
on [**6-10**] but then re-intubated on [**6-11**] (electively) for worsening
hypercarbia. Bronchoscopy performed immediately
post-reintubation showed bronchomalacia, although this was not
felt to be acute or likely contributing to his hypercarbia.
Steroids and antibiotics were continued, and his ventilation
mechanics improved. He was again extubated on [**6-14**] without
complication. 24-hours post-extubation he was transferred to the
general medicine floor. He can continue his home COPD regimen
after discharge as well as a 2 week prednisone taper.  Patient
is recommended to have wear autoset CPAP on 3L of supplemental
O2 at nights

# Bradycardia. Patient with sinus node dysfunction, pauses and
some hypotension prior to transfer. [**Month (only) 116**] be exacerbated by
overall illness and fluoroquinolone. Escape rhythm is narrow and
likely from the AV-junction. EP was consulted immediately upon
transfer and did not feel there was urgent indication for
pacemaker. They recommended for dopamine drip titrated to
maintain HR 50-60. As patient's pneumonia and COPD were treated
and improved, his sinus node dysfunction resolved and the
dopamine was weaned off. EP felt that there was no need for
pacemaker implantation during this admission.  Patient is being
discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts cardiac monitor to evaluate for
irregular rhythms or further episodes of bradycardia

# Acute Renal Failure. This was likely prerenal azotemia and
resolved with intravenous fluids.

# Hypothyroidism. patient was continued on his home regimen of
levothyroxine.

# Diabetes type II. patient was continued on his home regimen of
glybride.

# Communication. [**Name (NI) **] (son/HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96909**]

# Code.  Full - confirmed with HCP
