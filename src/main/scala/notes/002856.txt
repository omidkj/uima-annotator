Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, diarrhea, "feeling lousy"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and bovine AVR, T2DM,
hypotonic bladder with chronic foley and chronic cystitis who
presents with chest pain, diarrhea, and feeling lousy.
.
His last admission for chest pain was [**7-25**] and it was felt to
be due to GERD or gas/constipation and was recommended an
exercise stress test as an outpatient. He was last admitted to
the hospital [**8-25**] with weakness and falls of unclear etiology.
He has had 8 ED visits since that admission, typically for
dysuria and abdominal pain. He was seen in the ED yesterday for
UTI, worsening of a fungal groin infection and balanitis and
discharged to rehab. There are plans for suprapubic catheter
placement with urology next week due to his frequent UTIs and
fungal infections. He has been treated with Macrobid and
fluconazole intermittently since [**9-25**] and has a h/o ESBL E
Coli.
.
Today he reports that he started to "feel lousy" at rehab. He
developed diarrhea (2 episodes) that was nonbloody. Also had 2
episodes of vomiting, also nonbloody. After that, he developed
substernal chest pressure that moves across his chest. Denies
SOB, but endorses diaphoresis associated with the diarrhea and
vomiting. Also continues to complain of lower abdominal pain,
which is suprapubic and unchanged in character from his prior
presentations. Denies fevers, but states he has had chills. He
denies change in weight, PND, orthopnea.
.
Per rehab notes, he also complained of SOB and O2 sat decreased
to 88% on room air and improved with O2. Now denies SOB.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.0 60 111/64 16 99% 2L. Labs were
notable for troponin of 0.05 (baseline) and ECG showed NSR with
resolved RBBB. He was also given 1L IV fluids. Was guaiac
negative. UA was positive and he was given Macrobid. Given ASA
81mg x 4. Most recent vitals 95.6 64 106/62 18 93-97%2L
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. Also c/o chronic cough at night.
(-) Denies fever, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied shortness of breath. Denied palpitations. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and bovine AVR, T2DM,
hypotonic bladder with chronic foley and chronic cystitis who
presents with chest pain, diarrhea, and overall malaise.
.
# Complicated UTI: History of Vanc Sensitive Enterococci & ESBL
E.Coli.
The patient arrived with the following prior labwork: urine cx
from [**10-30**] was known to have ESBL E coli and VSE, urine cx from
[**11-13**] that ultimately grew ESBL E coli and yeast. Admitted to
the floor normotensive. Treated with [**Last Name (un) 2830**] given mico history,
and broadened to Vanc in the acute setting of hypotension. Vanc
was subsequently discontinued once the patient stabilized and
urine culture was negative. Completed inpatient [**Last Name (un) 2830**] course for
6 days.
.
# Labile blood pressure: Several hours after being admitted to
the floor, triggered for BP in the low 80s, subjective malaise /
lethargy, and decreased attention. ABG was reassuring.  Was
transiently responsive to fluid boluses but because of
refractory hypotension and concern for urosepsis, transferred to
the MICU for observation; flagyl was empirically started because
of concern for C.Dif. While in the MICU remained hemodynamically
stable with SBP in the low 100s and satting 93% on 2L, never
requiring pressors; returned to the floor in < 24h. As discussed
above, vanc was discontinued; flagyl was also stopped once
clinically stable.
.
#. Diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, bladder spasm:
His pain was localized to his upper midline groin, and was
ultimately attributed to bladder spasm. Given patient's history
of antibiotic use, C.dif was considered when hypotensive;
started on empiric flagyl therapy in the acute setting of labile
pressures as discussed above. The patient did not produce any
stools for culture/guaiac after transfer from MICU even with
bowel regimen. C.Dif was never confirmed; Flagyl was
discontinued.
.
# Recurrent UTI s/p suprapubic catheter: Underwent placement of
a suprapubic catheter [**2172-11-20**] with urology for recurrent UTIs
and bladder spasm. Will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 8 weeks after
discharge p
