EKG [**2164-9-30**]: sinus tach at 100 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no Q
waves, no acute ST changes (no changes compared to prior on
[**2164-9-26**])

Chest X-ray ([**2164-9-29**])- IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with
pulmonary edema. Repeat radiograph after treatment is
recommended.

Chest X-ray ([**2164-10-1**]) : IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema,
with unchanged cardiomegaly and tiny bilateral pleural
effusions.

Chest X-ray ([**2164-10-4**])-  IMPRESSION: Further improvement and
practical normalization of chest findings in patient who
suffered from advanced pulmonary edema on multiple previous
chest examinations.



Brief Hospital Course:
****MICU course****
Admitted with shortness of breath, with increased pulm edema on
CXR, responsive to nitro gtt and CPAP which was discontinued
upon arrival to the ICU.  She was dialyzed and 1.5L was removed
but she dropped her pressure and had some substernal chest
discomfort. EKG showed Afib/flutter at the time. CP resolved
with 500cc fluid given back.

****Floor course*****
That patient was transferred to the floor after doing well in
the unit.  While on the floor, she denied any shortness of
breath.  She was comfortable and did well on RA.  She had an
[**Month/Day/Year **] on [**10-2**] which showed an EF of >55% and "severe symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with small cavity and hyperdynamic
systolic function. Moderate mitral stenosis from mitral annular
calcifications. At least mild mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension".  Her verapamil dose was increased from
40mg to 60mg Q8hr to improve ventricular filling.  Due to the
high volume of admissions in the last week or so, the decision
was made to monitor her overnight and on a second session of
dialysis before considering discharging her.  Overnight on
[**10-2**], she developed flash pulmonary edema with elevated
pressures so she was transferred to the MICU.  Shortness of
breath resolved after receiving BiPAP and patient stablized in
the unit.  She was transferred back to the floor on [**10-3**].
Course is as below.

# Hypoxia/respiratory distress:  Given recent admissions,
patient kept and dialyzed daily while here.  Fluid was removed
each day and patient tolerated it well.  She has a history of
[**Last Name (un) 15970**] blood pressures but her BP's remained stable during this
admission.  Fluid status improved and shortness of breath
resolved.  She returned to [**Last Name (un) 5348**] oxygen requirements and was
asymptomatic.  She was weaned off nitro drip in ICU.  No signs
of pneumonia (afebrile, no cough, normal WBC).  INR therapeuatic
at 3.1 making PE unlikely.  Denied any chest pain, dizziness,
headaches, or syncopal-like events.  Ruled out for MI (cardiac
enzymes negative x 3, no EKG changes).
- continue home metoprolol, lisinopril, verapamil

# ESRD: Patient mildly volume overloaded on admission.  Renal
followed patient throughout stay.  She was dialyzed daily and
fluid was removed each time.  Patient remained hemodynamically
stable and symptoms resolved by discharge.  She is to continue
outpatient dialysis schedule on discharge.

# Atrial fibrillation:  She was in sinus rhythm and
rate-controlled on transfer to the floor.  Her INR was slightly
supratherapeutic on ad
