Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3948**]
Chief Complaint:
Malaise and cough.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2155-7-23**]: Flexible bronchoscopy. Thoracic ultrasound.
[**2155-7-24**]: Rigid bronchoscopy using the Dumon black bronchoscope.
Flexible bronchoscopy. Tumor debridement with argon plasma
coagulation (APC)and mechanical debridement.


History of Present Illness:
67 year old man who presented to his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 13835**] 6 weeks
ago due to malaise.  He has a long history of cough productive
of brown-yellow sputum as well as wheezing.  Due to his heavy
smoking history, a chest xray was ordered and an abnormality
detected therefore he was sent for a CT of the chest.  A
bronchoscopy was then considered however due to his COPD this
was not performed.  Rather, he was sent to us for evaluation. Of
note, he also complains of a 20 pound weight loss over the past
4 weeks.  He denies other constitutional symptoms and there are
no symptoms suggestive of localized metastatic involvement. He
underwent a flexible bronchoscopy today which revealed a near
occlusion of the bronchus intermedius with an endobronchial
mass. Therefore, the patient will be admitted for further
work-up/management.

CXR: [**2155-7-25**] The mass known to protrude into the right main
bronchus can be seen on the chest radiograph. There is no
pneumothorax.
[**2155-7-24**] FINDINGS: Reduced volume of the right hemithorax with
right basal alveolar opacity that shows central and peripheral
consolidation. The right retrocardiac lung is remarkably dense.
There is an abrupt blunting of the air column usually formed by
the bronchus intermedius. No evidence of pneumothorax. The left
lung is unremarkable.

CCT:
[**2155-7-23**]: IMPRESSION:
1) Large right lower lobe mass which has an endobronchial
component in the
bronchus intermedius causing complete collapse of the right
lower lobe with narrowing of the right middle lobe bronchus.
2)Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the subcarinal, right
hilar and
precarinal regions with enlarged nodes also in the right
paratracheal regions extending up to the 2R level. No
contralateral hilar lymph node enlargement.
3)Left adrenal soft tissue mass suspicious for a metastasis.
4)Diffuse right upper and middle lobe nodularity with
ground-glass appearance may be related to recent aspiration and
does not have a typical appearance for lymphangitis
carcinomatosa.
5)Left posterior basal segment moderate bronchiectasis with
reticular pattern and fibrosis suggests recurrent aspiration or
infection, which is probably unrelated to the right lower lobe
process.
CT staging is difficult to accurately assess due to the
difficulty in
assessing the tumor size, however, the most likely staging is a
T2b, N2, Mx.


MRI Head: [**2155-7-23**]
1. Microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
2. Central and cortical involutional changes advanced for the
patient's age of 67 years.
3. Multiple old lacunar infarcts as described above. No acute
intracranial
process detected.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82925**] was admitted on [**7-23**]/of for Right lung mass with
extrinsic
compression of bronchus intermedius and loculated right pleural
effusion.  He had a chest CT & Head MRI. (see above report).  He
underwent flexible bronchosocpy which showed an endobronchial
mass that was nearly obstructing the bronchus
intermedius but that mass was bypassed with patent distal
bronchus intermedius. On [**2155-7-24**] he was taken to the operating
room for Rigid bronchoscopy using the Dumon black bronchoscope.
Flexible bronchoscopy. Tumor debridement with argon plasma
coagulation (APC)and mechanical debridement. The preliminary
pathology results on the frozen sample of the tumor reveals
squamous cell carcinoma.  He was extubated in the operating room
and transferred to the PACU.  While in the PACU he had
respiratory distress requiring re-intubation.  He was
transferred to the SICU.  WIth good pulmonary toilet, nebs he
was extubated.  He was started on IV Zosyn for obstructive
pneumonia.  He remained in the SICU for airway management and
with aggressive continued pulmonary toilet his oxygenation
improved.  His oxygen was weaned with oxygen saturations in the
high 90's on room air.  He was discharged to home and will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and oncology as an outpatient.
