Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the CVICU on [**2145-11-4**] from [**Hospital 28448**] Center for further evaluation and treatment of
a Right foot infection.  She was admitted to the ICU due to her
chronic ventilator dependency.  While in the hospital she was
seen by the renal transplant service and the pulmonary service
for management suggestions for her kidney transplant and
ventilatory dependence.  The ICU attempted several times to
place central venous access without success.  She was maintained
on antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftaz, flagyl) while in the ICU. On
[**2145-11-8**] right forefoot PVRs were obtained.  On [**2145-11-8**] she was
taken to the operating room and her two ulcers were debrided and
wound vac was placed. At this time her trach was also changed to
a #8 fenestrated, cuffed portex trach. She tolerated both
procedures well and was taken back to the ICU for recovery.
Her wound vac will need changing Friday [**2145-11-12**] while in the
hospital.
