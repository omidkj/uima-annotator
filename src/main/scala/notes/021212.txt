History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82035**] is a 63 year old gentleman with relapsed
Non-Hodgkins lymphoma s/p auto-HSCT D+433 who presented from
clinic for reduced-intensity conditioning sibling-donor
allo-HSCT with ATG/TLI/clofarabine.  Patient had finished 4
cycles of gemcitabine/pralatrexate with partial response
[**Date range (3) 82036**]. In his 2[**Hospital **] clinic follow up, he felt well
overall.  On presentation, patient had no complaints except
bilateral shoulder pain from having his arms raised for a couple
of hours for central line placement by Interventional Radiology.
 He had some soreness at site of insertion as well.

On review of systems, patient denied fevers, chills, vision
changes, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, chest pain, abdominal pain, hematochezia,
diarrhea, urinary difficulties, leg swelling, rash.


Past Medical History:
Follicular Cell Lymphoma
Hx Kidney Stones
BPH
s/p L hip replacement ~[**2111**]
No history of cardiac disease.
No history of pulmonary disease
No hx of hemorrhagic cystitis s/p Cytoxan

Past Oncologic History:
1.   Excisional biopsy of an enlarged submandibular lymph node
on
[**2106-11-3**] showing follicular lymphoma, histological grade 2
with
positive BCL2 staining, bone marrow not involved.
2.   Clinical followup between [**2107**] and [**2113**].
3.   Parotid mass noticed in [**2113**], which was biopsied on
[**2113-6-21**]
showed involvement with mixed small and large cell follicular
lymphoma.  There was positive staining for BCL6 and BCL2 with
BCL2 chain rearrangement by PCR.  No rearrangements of
immunoglobulin heavy chain or BCL1 was demonstrated.  This was
consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell with mixed small
and large cell type of follicular center cell origin.
4.   Six cycles of R-CHOP between [**Month (only) **] and [**2113-11-23**].
5.   Clinical followup with serial CT scans showing enlarging
lymph nodes over time in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
suggestive of recurrence.
6.   Two cycles of RICE by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41471**] in 1/[**2115**].
7.   High-dose Cytoxan given on [**2115-2-28**].
11.  Peripheral stem cell collection [**Date range (1) 82037**].
12.  BEAM preparative regimen followed by auto-HSCT on [**2115-4-2**].
13.  3 doses of CT-011 on [**2115-6-26**], [**2115-8-7**] and [**2115-9-18**] on the
clinical trial 07-360 (evaluating the role of PD-1 blockade in
the post-transplant setting in patients with non-Hodgkin
lymphoma).
14.  Disease progression diagnosed in [**2115-11-24**] by a
fine-needle aspiration of right preauricular mass.  This showed
cells suspicious for lymphoma, flow cytometry showed a kappa
restricted CD10 positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
15.  4 cycles of gemcitabine and pralatrexate ([**Date range (3) 82036**])
on the clinical study 08-164.
16.  PET-CT on [**2116-5-13**] showed mixed response.


Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82035**] lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 3844**]. He quit
smoking in [**2113**]. He used to smoke two packs per day for 25
years. He occasionally drinks alcohol but has not had a drink
recently. Has a daughter also in [**Name (NI) **].


Family History:
He has two brothers and one sister without any
significant medical problems.

appreciated
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, mildly distended, bowel sounds
present

Pertinent Results:
Radiology Report [**Numeric Identifier 12139**] TUNNELED W/O PORT Study Date of [**2116-6-8**]
10:05 AM
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound and fluoroscopically-guided
placement of a tunneled triple-lumen central venous catheter via
right IJ accss with the tip terminating in the distal SVC. The
line is ready for use.

Radiology Report RENAL U.S. PORT Study Date of [**2116-6-10**] 9:45 AM
FINDINGS: The left kidney measures 11 cm. The right kidney
measures 12 cm. There is a 1-cm simple-appearing cyst in the
upper pole of right kidney. A 5-mm non-obstructive stone is
present within the interpolar region of left kidney. There is no
hydronephrosis or mass. The prostate is enlarged.  Partially
distended bladder appears within normal limits.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. 1-cm simple right upper pole renal cyst.
3. 5-mm non-obstructive left renal stone in the interpolar
region.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2116-6-14**]  4:45:24 PM
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 76. Borderline low voltage. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2116-5-27**] the sinus rate is marginally
slower and borderline low voltage is new, possibly a precordial
electrode lead placement effect.

1. echogenic liver, compatible with fatty infiltration, although
more advanced
disease such as fibrosis cannot be excluded.
2. non-dilated gallbladder full of sludge.
3. CBD not dilated. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
4. main portal vein patent, with normal hepatopedal flow.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2116-6-27**] Liver u/s
IMPRESSION: No evidence of portal vein or large vessel venous
thrombosis.
.
[**2116-6-30**] ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: At least mild global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Pleural effusions.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-5-26**], LV
systolic dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, pulmonary
hypertension and substantial pleural effusions are all new.
Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 1425 hours on the day of
the study.

[**2116-7-6**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determine
