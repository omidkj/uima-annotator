Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2118-6-20**] Emergent Five Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, vein grafts
to diagonal, first obtuse marginal, second obtuse marginal and
posterior descending artery)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old male with ESRD and known CAD. In
[**2116-12-16**] he underwent placement of drug eluding stent to
the circumfex. RCA was totally occluded at that time. Since
[**2117-8-15**], he had self discontinued taking Aspirin, Plavix,
Lipitor and Lopressor secondary to AV fisutla bleeding
complications.

On the day of admission, he presented to OSH with progressive
worsening chest pain for several weeks duration. He was started
on intravenous therapy and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and treatment. He did rule in for a myocardial
infarction with positive cardiac enzymes.

Past Medical History:
-Coronary Artery Disease, s/p PCI/Stenting(see above)
-End Stage Renal Disease, s/p Renal Transplantation 27 years
ago(failure since [**2109**]), on Hemodialysis, Left AV Fistula
-Hypertension
-Congestive Heart Failure
-Obstructive Sleep Apnea
-Hyperphosphotemia

Married, lives with wife.

Denies premature coronary artery disease

[**2118-6-20**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe 3
vessel disease.  The LMCA was angiographically normal.  The
proximal LAD
had a 90% stenosis after D1, followed by 80% mid stenosis.  D1
had 99%
proximal stenosis.  The LCx was 100% occluded proximally at the
site of
prior stent placement in [**2116**].  The RCA was 100% occluded
proximally
with distal filling via left to right collaterals.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 30 mmHg.  There was severe pulmonary
arterial
systolic hypertension with PASP of 72 mmHg.  Pulmonary capillary
wedge
pressure was severely elevated (a/v/m=44/50/40 mmHg).  There was

systemic arterial systolic hypotension with aortic systolic
pressure of
96 mmHg.  Cardiac output was compromised at 2.10 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculograpy was not performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization
which showed critically severe three vessel coronary artery
disease(see result section). He was therefore taken urgently to
the operating room where coronary artery bypass grafting was
performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Given his end
stage renal disease, CVVHD was initiated for fluid management
with gradual transition to hemodialysis. He has an isolated
episode of SVT which was successfully treated with Adenosine
with conversion back to a normal sinus rhythm. He initially
remained critically ill and was kept intubated and sedated for
several days. Tube feedings were eventually initiated for
nutritional support. He required placement of a left chest tube
for hemothorax on postoperative day four. On postoperative day
five, fevers were noted along with a leukocytosis. Pan cultures
were obtained, and empiric antibiotics were initiated. Chest
x-ray was suscipious for pneumonia. Given persistent agitation,
the psychiatry service was consulted which attributed it to
postoperative delirium. He intermittenly required Haldol and
Ativan for behavioral control. He was eventually extubated
without incident and gradually weaned from inotropic support.

His chest tubes and pacing wires were DC'd without incidence,

After his CSRU stay. Pt did quite well. He was transfered to the
floor. On the floor he made steady progress. He worked with PT.
He progressed to a point were he no longer needed rehab.

He also recieved hemodialysis while  on the floor in his regualr
scheduled cirriculum. M / W / F.
