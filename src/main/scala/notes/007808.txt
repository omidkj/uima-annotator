Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year old man with a history of HTN, DM2
who presented with lethargy. Around 1100, he had a gradual onset
of lightheadedness and malaise. He was going to meet a friend
for
lunch but decided to cancel, opting to stay at home instead. He
called his son at some point who arrived at his house around
1700, finding his father very lethargic. He was arousable to
voice at that time.  He was brought to an OSH ED where he
reportedly was AAO x 3, had a BP of 200/102, and was found on
NCHCT to have a R basal ganglia hemorrhage for which he was
transferred via [**Location (un) 7622**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for Neurosurgical evaluation.
He was briefly started on a Nicardipine infusion but his blood
pressure decreased on its own to SBP 160s-170s. He was given
Midazolam 0.5 mg once during the helicopter ride for anxiety.
Besides the antecedent lightheadedness, he felt well prior to
the
progressive lethargy and currently has no complaints. This had
never happened before. He was is not aware of any weakness,
numbness, vision changes, speech changes, or other neurologic
symptoms as described below in the review of systems.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies headache,
lightheadedness, or confusion.
Denies difficulty with producing or comprehending speech.
Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo,
tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
Denies muscle weakness.
Denies loss of sensation.
Denies bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, rigors,
night sweats, or noticeable weight loss.
Denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or cough.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal
pain.
Denies dysuria or hematuria.
Denies myalgias, arthralgias, or rash.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2172-10-23**]: IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly. Otherwise, normal

CT HEAD [**2172-10-24**]: IMPRESSION: 20 x 11 mm acute right thalamic
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, unchanged from the outside hospital
CT from [**2172-10-23**].

MRI HEAD [**2172-10-24**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Right basal ganglia thalamic hemorrhage with mild surrounding
edema. The hemorrhage is unchanged in size compared to the CT of
[**2172-10-24**]. No
associated infarcts seen. No abnormal vascular flow voids to
indicate
underlying vascular malformation.
2. Small amount of subarachnoid blood is seen in the
interpeduncular cistern.
3. Moderate to severe brain atrophy and small vessel disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 89251**] is an 84yoM h/o HTN, DM2 p/w depressed LOC s/p R
thalamic/IC intraparenchymal hemorrhage, likely hypertensive in
etiology. Presented in the acute phase and therefore required
close blood pressure management, neurologic exam
monitoring, and repeat imaging to further elucidate the etiology
of the hemorrhage and was therefore initially admitted to the
ICU.

# Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage - Pt diagnosed with
intraparenchymal hemorrhage of unknown source.  His MRI was not
revealing as to an etiology. He will need a repeat MRI 6-8 weeks
from his initial bleed for further evaluation. The bleed is
likely hypertensive but may also be related to an underlying
cavernoma.

# Hypertension - We kept patient's SBP < 160 with PRN
hydralazine.  Pt was monitored on telemetry and his home
lisinopril and amlodipine were continued.  We did hold his ASA
given the IPH (as above).  His Furosemide was initially held due
to concerns about salt-wasting, but it was later restarted as
his hyponatremia seemed to have a component of SIADH which
improved.

# Fever - U/A positive but UCx showed no growth. He was briefly
started on Ceftriaxone which was discontinued when his UCx was
shown to be negative. His CXR was clear. He had no
