Pertinent Results:

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted through ER for fever and hypotension. Admitted to
SICU for ventilatory management. His indwelling PICC line was
removed. Cultures drawn and pt continued on meropenem and zyvox
as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **].

Resp: He was placed on assist-control mode ventilation with a
PEEP of 10. A speech and swallow eval was reluctant to advance
his po's as at that high of PEEP his ability to swallow would be
impaired. Throughout his hospital course his PEEP was gradually
reduced. This was not pursued aggressively, as it was felt that
[**Hospital1 **] was well-suited to do a long, gradual [**Hospital1 **] wean that
would be ideal for this patient, and the acute hospital issue
was the infection. He was discharged on the [**Hospital1 **] with a PEEP of
5 on assist-control, with the understanding that [**Hospital1 **] would
resume his [**Hospital1 **] wean.

GI: As he had no active GI issues, his tubefeeds were rapidly
increased to his goal rate. He tolerated this well, as would be
expected. No other acute GI issues.

ID: Although pt arrived with high fevers and likely infection,
his cultures were negative except for a positive MRSA screen,
which was unsurprising as the pt is known to be MRSA-positive.
Pt continued to be afebrile throughout hospital course on
meropenem and linezolid.

Neuro: Pt has been on long-term [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] no significant sedation
was needed for [**First Name3 (LF) **] tolerance. No other active issues.

GU: Although a UTI was suspected as an infectious source, urine
culture was negative.
