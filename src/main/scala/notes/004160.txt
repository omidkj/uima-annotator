ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2118-9-5**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular
cavity size is  normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed.  Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferior akinesis and  inferolateral
hypokinesis (estimated ejection fraction ?40%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears  depressed. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal  septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume  overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly  dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic  valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The  tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid  regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared to the prior study of [**2118-9-4**], findings are similar.
Aortic
regurgitation now may be slightly more prominent.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2118-9-4**]
COMMENTS:
1) Initial angiography was unchanged from previous
catherization.  The
RCA had a 100% mid vessel occlusion with collaterals to the
distal
vessel from the left system. The LAD and CX had high grade
lesions.
2) Successful PTCA, thrombectomy, and stenting of the distal,
mid, and
ostial RCA with multiple Cypher stents.  A 2.75x16 mm Taxus was
deployed
in the distal RCA and was postdilated with a 2.75 mm NC balloon.

Overlapping 3.0x16 mm and 3.5x28 mm Taxus stents were placed in
the mid
RCA and the 3.5 mm stent was postdilated with a 3.5 mm NC
balloon.  A
3.5x16 mm Taxus stent was placed in the ostial RCA and
postdilated with
a 4.0 mm NC balloon.  Final angiography revealed <10 % residual
stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.  (see PTCA comments)
3) Successful placement of an IABP and transvenous pacemaker
given the
bradycardic arrest and cardiogenic shock.
4) Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right and
left sided
filling pressures, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and normal
cardiac
outputs.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock with severely elevated left and right sided
filling
pressures with normal cardiac outputs on IABP support.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca,
temporary pacemaker, and IABP.
4. PTCA of RCA vessel with multiple drug eluting stents.


Brief Hospital Course:
72yo M with multiple cardiac risk factors presented with STEMI,
found to have 3VD awaiting CABG, became HD unstable, coded >
1hr, brought back to cath lab and received four taxus stents to
RCA. Patient was stabilized in the CCU on two pressors,
intraortic balloon pump and transvenous pacer wire. These were
all weened over the course of 4 days. Through discussions of
risks and benefits with CT surgery, the patient's family, and
primary cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] it was decided to not undergo
CABG for multivessel disease. The family decided on DNR/DNI code
status at that time. With the patient stable off IABP and
pressors he was extubated on [**2118-9-9**] however developed pulmonary
edema and increased oxygen requirement. Was placed on BiPAP as
temporizing measure. Further discussion with family confirmed
DNR/DNI status, and they later decided to make the patient
comfort measures only. Morphine drip was titrated for comfort
and air hunger. The patient was pronounced dead at 11:25am on
[**2118-9-10**].
