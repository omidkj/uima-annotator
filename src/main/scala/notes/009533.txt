c diff neg x 2 (3rd pending)
[**Last Name (un) **] cx [**2-14**]: neg
sputum cx [**2-14**]: mod OP flora
H pylori: positive
blood cx 2/17,24,25: no growth

LENI: Nonocclusive thrombus, left common femoral-popliteal
veins.

EGD [**2174-2-11**]:
Grade IV esophagitis in the middle third of the esophagus and
lower third of the esophagus.
Large hiatal hernia.
Erythema, congestion and friability in the whole stomach
compatible with gastritis.
Congestion, erythema and friability in the duodenal bulb
compatible with duodenitis.

KUB [**2174-2-12**]:
There is gas present throughout the colon with some retained
contrast in the right colon. There are gas filled loops of
nondilated small bowel. Soft tissue density in right flank,
presumably related to known hematoma. Overall appearance is
unchanged since the prior film of [**2174-2-10**].

Renal U/S [**2174-2-15**]: No hydronephrosis or renal calculi.

Angiogram/embolization [**2174-2-11**]:
FINDINGS: There are diffuse atherosclerotic changes in the
abdominal aorta
and iliac arteries with extensive tortuosity of the iliac
arteries
bilaterally. There is no evidence of active extravasation on
aortogram with selective injection of the contrast material into
the right external iliac artery and right inferior epigastric
artery. Gelfoam slurry for embolization of the right inferior
epigastric artery until complete stagnation of flow.
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of acute extravasation.
2) Prophylactic embolization of the right inferior epigastric
artery using
gelfoam slurry.

CT abd [**2174-2-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Large right rectus sheath hematoma measuring 22.3 x 14.0 x
8.3 cm. Oblong collection of arterial attenuation blood medially
within the hematoma, which by Doppler, represents focal ectasia
of a branch of the inferior epigastric artery. An additional
fluid/contrast level is present more laterally within the
hematoma, which demonstrates CT evidence of active
extravasation.
2) Very distended gallbladder with a 6-mm calcified stone in
gallbladder neck or proximal cystic duct. No CT evidence of
acute cholecystitis. Continued clinical followup recommended.
3) Two rounded low-attenuation cystic structures in the tail of
the pancreas. The findings are nonspecific and could be sequelae
of prior pancreatitis, but IPMT cannot be excluded.

CXR [**2174-2-18**]:
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is upper zone
vascular
redistribution, but there is no overt evidence of pulmonary
edema. Small
pleural effusions are noted bilaterally, and the right pleural
effusion may have an associated subpulmonic component.

Labs on d/c:
hct 34.5, creatinine 2.4, sodium 130, wbc 12.1


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 83 yo F w/ h/o htn, gout, CRI, and depression a/w LLE DVT
for which she was anticoagulated but unfortunately developed a
rectus abd sheath hematoma and coffee ground emesis while on
anticoag so underwent embolization of inferior epigastric artery
and IVC filter.

# DVT: Likely [**1-19**] decreased mobility and venous insufficiency.
Pt was placed on a heparin drip and 5 mg coumadin was started
once PTT was in the goal range of 60-80 and stopped once pt's
INR was therapeutic (goal INR [**1-20**]). Unfortunately, while on
anticoagulation, patient developed a right rectus sheath
hematoma w/ concurrent hct drop. She was transfused and
underwent inferior epigastric artery embolization to control the
bleeding. Her coumadin was reversed and an IVC filter was placed
([**2174-2-11**]) for management of her DVT.

# LE cellulitis: Initially, pt was started on oxacillin as she
has no h/o DM and no bites/water exposure to suggest need for
broader coverage. However, her cellulitis did not improve and
her WBC climbed. She was switched to unasyn, again without
improvement, suggesting MRSA cellulitis. Vanco was started with
improvment clinically and with a decreased WBC. She is now
completing a total of 14 days levo/flagyl to cover both her
cellulitis and aspiration PNA and has been doing well.

# acute oliguric RF
Patient p/w baseline creatinine 1.8 on admission. Unfortunately,
in the setting of 2 IV contrast studies in addition to prerenal
insult due to acute bleeding, patient suffered acute oliguric
renal failure. Renal was consulted and suspect ATN. Due to
worsening uremia (causing AMS) decision was made to place a left
femoral temporary dialysis catheter. Patient underwent 4 HD
sessions and is much improved. Her HD line was pulled on [**2174-2-19**]
after her urine output returned to approx 1 L qd and her
creatinine was consistently improving. Plan to continue to
follow chem 10 and monitor i's/o's at rehab w/ plan for
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 98846**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of nephrology if
creatinine does not return to baseline 1.8 by the end of her
rehab stay.

# GIB:
In addition to a rectus sheath hematoma, patient developed
coffee ground emesis while on anticoag. She underwent an EGD
this admission which showed grd IV
esophagitis/gastritis/duodenitis. Of note, serum H pylori was
positive so she is being tx w/ flagyl, amox, and [**Hospital1 **] ppi x 14
days total. No NSAIDs. Hct has been stable for days.

# Hypoxia
Patient developed an O2 reqmt over her hospital stay. CXR showed
RML and RLL infiltrates concerning for aspiration. Antibx were
broadened from vanc to levo/flagyl to cover aspiration PNA given
patient also demonstrating a rising wbc. She will continue on
these antibx through [**2174-2-24**]. She is due for a swallow
evaluation today prior to d/c though she is on a re
