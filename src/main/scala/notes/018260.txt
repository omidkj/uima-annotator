Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia, sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
89M h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia and prostate CA presented with
increased confusion, fever, lethargy with multiple falls for
several days prior to admission.
.
In the ED, patient was febrile to 102F, and found to have a
retrocardiac opacity concerning for pneumonia as well as a
creatinine of 2.3 increased from his baseline of 1.2.  Oxygen
saturation on room air was in the low 80s, and the patient was
found to have systolics in the 80s.  The patient had a central
line placed in the ED, received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin as
well as volume resuscitation, and admitted to the MICU for
sepsis.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient had received 3L NS with
improvement in SBP to low 100s, and therefore did not require
pressors.  No other source of fever was located and antibiotics
were therefore tailored to levofloxacin for community acquired
pneumonia.  Influenza testing was negative.  After
stabilization, the patient was transferred to the floor.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient had only mild dyspnea, and
no other complaints.

Microbiology:

# UA: Small leukocytes, no bacteria
.
# Blood cultures no growth
.
STUDIES:
# CXR [**2195-3-25**]: No definite consolidation however there is
relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15410**] atelectasis in both lung bases worse on the
left. There is an indistinct opacity adjacent to the superior
mediastinum in the right apex. While this may be due to
underlying aortic tortuosity, either airspace process,
atelectasis, or possible underlying ground-glass nodule cannot
be excluded on the basis of this examination. PA and lateral
views may be of benefit however CT may be indicated given the
multiple complaints listed in the history.
.
# CXR [**2195-3-25**]: Left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation with
worsening failure. Right upper lobe opacity is concerning for a
mass, and should be further investigated with cross-sectional
imaging.
.
# CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage
.
# CT chest [**2195-3-27**]:
1. Well marginated 3.5 cm mass abutting the pleura in the
posterior segment of the right upper lobe corresponding with the
region of abnormality seen on the previous chest radiograph.
Further characterization with PET CT is recommended to exclude
malignancy. If no FDG activity is seen within this lesion on PET
imaging, a followup chest CT is recommended in three months to
assess for temporal stability.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent relaxation
atelectasis.
3. Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes suggesting previous
granulomatous infection.
4. Moderately severe compression fractures of several mid
thoracic vertebral bodies of unknown chronicity. Recommend
correlation with outside imaging studies to assess stability.

Brief Hospital Course:
89M Russian speaking h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer,
admitted to the MICU with CAP and sepsis, and found to have a
mass in right lung apex.
.
# Community acquired pneumonia/sepsis:  Given patient's
admission x-ray, community acquired pneumonia was considered the
most likely cause for his symptoms and hypotension.  Blood and
urine cultures were negative.  Patient was begun on a 10 day
course of levofloxacin and was discharged with good ambulatory
oxygen saturations on room air.
.
# Acute renal failure: Patient was in acute renal failure with
elevated creatinine of 2.3 on admission.  He received IV fluids
and antibiotics for septic pneumonia, and his creatinine
returned to baseline.
.
# Falls: Patient's falls were considered likely secondary to
infection and sepsis.  CT head on admission was negative for
ICH, and he received physical therapy while inpatient.
.
# Hypertension: Patient presented with hypotension, and his home
regimen of antihypertensives were initially held.  On transfer
to the floor he was borderline hypertensive and outpatient
antihypertensive regimen resumed including nifedipine.  Atenolol
stopped and he was changed to metoprolol given acute renal
failure on admission.
.
# Lung mass NOS: CXR on admission revealed a rounded nodule at
right apex concerning for malignancy.  CT chest demonstrated a
3.5 cm mass abutting pleura in posterior segment of RUL.
Radiology recommending characterization with PET CT.  the
patient was provided with a PET CT appointment and given
instructions on preparing for the exam.  Follow-up was arranged
as an outpatient.
.
# Prostate cancer: Patient's history of known prostate cancer
was considered a possible source of his new lung mass.  Patient
was continued on doxazosin, with PSA less than 0.1.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were confused,
falling and having fevers.  You were found to have a pneumonia,
you were treated with antibiotics, and you improved.  You were
also found to have kidney failure.  Later, you were found to
have a mass in your right lung.  You had a CT scan that
confirmed the mass and its location.  We will be referring you
to workup this mass as an outpatient; please see below for
information on the appointments for the workup.
.
We have made no changes to your medications.
