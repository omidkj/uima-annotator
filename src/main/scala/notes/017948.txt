pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple with JVP of 14 cm

Pertinent Results:
TEE [**2151-4-22**]: Limited images were obtained by transesophageal
echocardiogram to view the positioning of a right ventricular
pacemaker lead in the electrophysiology laboratory. Ebstein's
anomaly was present with apically displaced sail-like tricuspid
leaflets. A tricuspid annuloplasty ring is present at the AV
groove. Atrialized right ventricle is dilated with a hypokinetic
true right ventricle at the apex. The right ventricular
pacemaker lead was guided through the tricuspid valve into the
true right ventricular apex.

Brief Hospital Course:
39 yo M presenting with palpitations, dizziness and chest
heaviness with PMH of Ebstein's anomoly s/p tricuspid valve
recontsruction and ASD repair with known NYHF calss III CHF and
recent admission for palpitations and VT s/p cardioversion. Had
ICD placed without complication.  Discharged in stable contition
home with cardiology, EP and BACH team follow up appointments.

# Palpitations: Had prior to admission, none while in patient.
Has Ebstein's anomoly. Patient with hx VT, EP study unable to
reproduce but had short runs of NSVT, but nothing was ablated
given could no induce VT.  At that time, morphology was LBBB
wtih inferior axis and V1/V2 transition point.  Focus per EP
study was likely RVOT.  Patient was on amiodarone drip fpr 2
days which was then d/c'ed in preparation for ICD placement
which was done without complication. Continued metoprolol 25 mg
tid.  Discharged in stable condition with follow up as above.

# Chest pressure: Had on admission, but none after. Has no known
coronary artery disease.  Cardiac biomakers negative were
negative x3. Symptoms were likely related to palpitations.

# Ebstein's Anomoly:  Followed by the BACH team at [**Hospital1 **],
contact is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2413**].  Has follow up with them in [**Month (only) 547**].
Likely plan is surgery after optimizing patient's physical
health - weight loss specifically.  Patient aware.

# CHF: EF 40%, class III symptoms. Euvolemic throughout hospital
stay, had baseline lower extremity edema right greater than left
which is baseline.  Patient has had LENIs at prior admission
with no DVT. Has elevated JVP thought to be [**3-15**] to 4+ tricuspid
regurgitation. Increased lasix to 40mg qd and increased
lisinopril to 5mg qd.

# Elevated INR: Has been chronically elevated 1.5-1.7,
non-responsive to po vitamin K x2 during this hospitalization.
Likely secondary to heart failure, possibly cirrhosis.  LFT's
normal  Hep C negative, mixing study negative.  Recommend out
patient follow up with hepatologist and liver ultrasound.

# PPx: received heparin
