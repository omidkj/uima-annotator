History of Present Illness:
76 yo Male with hx of  AVR, CAD s/p CABG,  MDS- pancyopenia,
non-hodgkins lymphoma, and Parkinson's who was relaeased from
the hospital 2 months ago for a pneumonia. He brought in from

CXR [**7-25**] PA and lateral
The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG.  Heart
remains mildly enlarged with left ventricular predominance.  The
patient is status post aortic valve replacement.  The
mediastinal contours are unchanged, with mild calcification of
the aortic knob again demonstrated as well as a mildly tortuous
course of the thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
engorged.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases are nonspecific,
possibly reflecting atelectasis though infection cannot be
excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:
Streaky bibasilar opacities, which could reflect atelectasis
though infection cannot be completely excluded.



Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo Male with hx of AVR, CAD s/p CABG, MDS- pancyopenia,
non-hodgkins lymphoma, and Parkinson's who was relaeased from
the hospital 2 months ago for a pneumonia who returns with a
HCAP and new a. fib w/ rvr. Was treated in the ICU and
transferred to the floor to complete 10 day course of
antibiotics.

1) HCAP pneumonia/sepsis- Pt initially sirs criteria, and
presented with dry cough x2 weeks, new weakness, and his CXR was
concerning for a new RLL inflitate. With the pt's history of
Parkinson's disease, was at risk for aspiration due to
dysphagia, and thus cause recurrent pneumonia. Pt's fever curve
improved with vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin for a 10 day
course (through [**2167-8-6**]). Blood cultures were negative. Pt's dry
cough did not improve with cough syrup, tessalon perles and
nebulizer treatments and thus had an ENT consult which found
mild irritation of vocal cords most likely related to acid
reflux or viral infection. Laryngoscopy did not show vocal cord
paralysis and structurally normal. Cough mildly improved while
on the floor, but still with significant cough at discharge. He
was started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily for a 4 day total
course to end on [**2167-8-2**].

2) New Atrial fib w/ rvr in 120s likely due to stress of
increasing cardic output in septic picture. Other concerns
included his thyroid medicine and new ischemia but TSH normal
and cardiac enzymes were negative. Pt was rate controlled with
metoprolol 50mg TID and was successfully converted to NS rhythm.
Echo was done which showed LVEF>55%, no thrombus. Pt's CHADS2
score at 1. Aspirin was held due to thrombocytopenia.
Metoprolol was discontinued given his reactive airways and
wheezing. On stopping, patient tended to be borderline
tachyardia with intermittent atrial fibrillation and bigeminal
PACs. When his pulmonary symptoms resolve, metoprolol should be
considered if his tachycardia/afib persists at rehab.

3) Parkinson's disease: Was continued on home pramipexole during
course and was evaluated by speech and swallow for dysphagia; pt
was cleared for regular solid PO intake.

4) MDS/Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: s/p chemo and BMT, chronic
thrombocytopenia. Pt had no bleeding issues.  Patient required
transfusion of 1 unit of platelets prior to PICC line placement
but otherwised remained above transfusion threshold without
evidence of bleeding.

5) Hyperlipidemia: Rosuvastatin was continued throughout course.

6) BPH: Tamsulosin was continued throughout course.

7) Depression/Anxiety: Stable, PRN diazepam. Was requiring
approximately one additional dose of diazepam daily.

8) Hypothyroid: continue home Levothyroxine Sodium 50 mcg PO
DAILY. TSH normal.

9) Left ear ceurmen: Stable.

10) Constipation: Continued Lactulose, Polyethylene Glycol,
Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID, and Senna 1 TAB PO BID.

# Transitional issues:
- Consider starting patient on metoprolol for new atrial
fibrillation, was started in ho
