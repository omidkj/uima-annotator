Allergies:
Amitriptyline / Norvasc

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
65 y/o M with PMHx of CAD s/p stenting, Afib/flutter, DM with
neuropathy and tobacco dependance who presents with productive
cough and SOB for 3 days. Pt reports upper respiratory
congestion and cough with yellow sputum but denies fever &
chills.  Pt describes PND, orthopnea and new nocturia but has
minimal exertion capacity and denies DOE.  He also reports
approx 1 wk of difficulty swallowing, coughing with thin liquids
though no prior history of aspiration.  Pt has poor dentition
and difficulty chewing solid foods. He initially presented to
his PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] morning and was discharged with prescription
of Azithro and plan for outpt CXR.  However, his shortness of
breath worsened overnight and he presented to the ED early
tuesday morning.
.
VS on arrival to the ED were: T 97.6 BP 148/104 HR 122 RR 28
Sats 100% on RA.  CXR revealed LLL infiltrate and pt received
Ceftriaxone 1gram, Azithromycin 500mg, Prednisone 60mg, Duonebs
and 3L of NS IVF. Pt was given diltiazem 20mg IV for HR of 130
and was noted to have increasing O2 requirement.  Pt was unable
to wean from NRB and was started on diltiazem gtt for rate
control.  Repeat CXR showed worsening pulm edema and LLL
consolidation.
.
On arrival to CCU, pt was feeling better, still c/o cough and
mild SOB.  Denies any fevers/chills, CP/palpitations, abd pain,
nausea/vomiting or diarrhea.

[**3-10**] ECHO

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-12-13**],
tricuspid regurgittaion is now more prominent and estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher. Left
ventricular and right ventricular systolic function is less
vigorous.

[**3-10**] CXR

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2144-3-10**] obtained of
04:16 a.m. and chest radiograph from [**2143-11-8**].

The left lower lobe consolidation accompanied by pleural
effusion is
unchanged but there is overall progression of perihilar vascular
engorgement continuing towards the right lower lung with small
right pleural effusion present. The radiological picture is
consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with the
abnormality at the left lung being either a separate entity such
as a pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion or potentially can be
due to asymmetric pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

ADDENDUM: Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] over the
phone by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] approximately at 8:55 a.m. on [**3-10**], [**2144**].

[**3-11**] CXR

1. Increase in consolidation at the left lung base with slight
increase in pleural effusion is concerning for pneumonia.

2. CHF with new mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 year-old male with coronary artery disease, atrial
fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type with neuropathy and tobacco
dependance admitted [**2144-3-10**] with productive cough and SOB for 3
days. Patient was initially admitted to MICU, then medicine
service, and finally to cardiology service prior to discharge.
Hospital course was as follows.

1. Hypoxia:  Etiology likely multifactorial. On initial
presentation, patient was with adequate O2 saturation on RA and
became progressively hypoxic with IVF resuscitation and Afib
with [**Month/Day/Year 5509**].  Lobar pneumonia treated with good response with
ceftriaxone (ten day course with 3 days of cefpodoxime
prescribed at discharge) and azithromycin (5 day course).  Pt
became fluid overloaded intermittently with shortness of breath,
which responded well to 20mg IV furosemide.  Pt also experienced
great symptomatic relief with brochodilators suggesting a
brochospasm component to his dyspnea.  After several days of
gentle diuresis, antibiotics and nebulizer treatments, patient
was saturating 95% on room and breathing comfortably.
Discharged on continued antibiotics, furosemide, and albuterol.

2. Chronic diastolic heart failure:  TTE on [**2144-3-10**] revealed EF
50-55% with minimal decrease in systolic function from prior
TTE.  Evidence of pulmonary hypertension. On cardiology service,
patient experienced tachypnea at ni
