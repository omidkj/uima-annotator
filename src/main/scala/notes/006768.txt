History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o CAD s/p MI, systolic CHF (EF
45%), NSCLC, dementia, and recurrent LE edema c/b recurrent
cellulitis who was admitted to MICU for lethargy, urinary
incontinence and hypotension. Of note, pt had a course of
Vancomycin for LE cellulitis during a recent hospitalization
([**August 2126**]), then with suppressive Keflex at outpatient follow-up.
 Pt had fevers up to 103 with SBP 80s with tachy 110-120s in ED
requiring 4L IVF in ED. Admitted to MICU overnight, received
2.5L in MICU, with improved SBP 110s and improved UOP. Patient
with cellulitis on left leg, currently on vanco/cefepime. CXR
Also with possible infiltrate on RLL. Patient NPO with
aspiration, undergoing S/S eval.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, pt appears comfortable.  Doesn't
remember being in the MICU or why he is in the hospital. Has no
complaints, except mentions that he has an infection in his left
leg. Denies fevers, pain, shortness of breath, chest pain.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt received levofloxacin and zosyn empirically. LENIs
were negative, but LUE US showed DVT. CTA chest negative for PE.
CXR negative for pneumonia. CT head negative. In the ED, HR went
up to 110-120s, and systolic BP dropped to 80s. At that time,
the ED physician spoke with the patient's daughter about central
line and pressors, and the daughter refused. [**Name2 (NI) 7092**] status was
confirmed DNR/DNI.

Pertinent Results:
MICROBIOLOGY:
[**9-29**] Urine culture pending
[**9-29**] Blood culture pending
.
STUDIES:
[**9-29**]: CTA
1. No acute PE.
2. Unchanged appearance of the large subcarina mass, compatible
with the known adenoCA.
3. Unchanged emphysema.
.
[**2126-9-29**] LENIs: No LE DVT
.
[**2126-9-29**] Left upper extremity US:
1. thrombus in left basilic vein.
2. small-caliber Left IJ with evidence of flow.
.
CT head: No acute intracranial process.
.
EKG: NSR @ 103bpm. Nl axis. No ST segment changes. Unchanged
from prior on [**2126-8-28**].
.
CXR: No infiltrates or pleural effusions. Small nodules seen
bilaterally. Largely unchanged from prior x-ray.  early PNA
cannot be ruled out.
.
[**9-26**] EGD:
Abnormal motility of the esophagus was noted. There were
continuous vigorous contractions throughout the esophagus. The
LES was not hypertonic. The esophagus was tortuous. There were
no intrinsic or extrinsic lesions seen. Normal stomach. Normal
duodenum.
Impression: Abnormal esophageal motility
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**2126-10-1**] video swallow study:
FINDINGS: Oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was
performed in
conjunction with the speech and swallow division. Multiple
consistencies of barium were administered. Barium passed freely
through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence for
obstruction. There is evidence of esophageal dysmotility with
the lack of primary peristaltic waves. There was no gross
aspiration. Penetration was noted for free liquids. There was
free spill noted.
IMPRESSION:
1.Penetration with thin liquids was noted.
2.Esophageal dysmotility with the lack of primary peristaltic
waves.
.
[**2126-9-30**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is little change. Bibasilar opacifications appear more
suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia. However, in view of
the clinical symptom of fever, the possibility of pneumonia can
certainly not be excluded.
On the lateral view, there is evidence of bilateral pleural
effusions.
No evidence of cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascular congestion at
this time.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o CAD, Systolic CHF (EF 45%), NSCLC,
dementia, and recurrent LE edema complicated by recurrent
cellulitis who was admitted with fever, altered mental status,
and worsening LLE cellulitis.
.
# Fever/Cellulitis: Pt remained afebrile, had no leukocytosis.
Blood cultures were negative to date at time of discharge, urine
cultures showed no growth.  Pt was briefly on Cefepime for
possible pneumonia, but since CXR did not show consolidation, it
was discontinued.  The fever was likely due to recurrent
cellulitis. Pt was started on IV Vancomycin for it.  Dr.
[**Name (NI) 5461**], pt's outpatient ID physician was [**Name (NI) 653**] and per
his recs, pt was then switched to Keflex 500mg PO q6h and
Bactrim 1 DS PO BID for a 2week course.  Pt has a follow-up
appointment with him soon at which time the current antibiotic
regmen can be reassessed.  Pt's chronic venous stasis of lower
extremities were treated with compression stockings and legs
were kept elevated.  Potassium was monitored as pt was newly
started on Bactrim (4.3 on day of discharge).
.
# Altered mental status: Patient's mental status was quickly
back at baseline per family.  Vit B12 and TSH were wnl. EKG was
unchanged from baseline, and CEs were neg. Head CT was negative.
Head MRI from [**2126-3-22**] was negative for mets. LFTs were not
elevated.  A video swallow study was performed because there was
a question of aspiration.  The results indicated that the pt can
be advanced to a diet, and the pt has been tolerating it well.
.
# LUE basilic vein thrombus:  Pt was started on Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] for
a small thrombus that was seen by Doppler U/S. It was then
decided that the risks outweigh the benefits of anticoagulation
at this point and thus we did not proceed with bridging to
Coumadin.  This decision was discussed with pt's daughter, and
she was in agreement.  The Lovenox was sunsequently discontinued
as the pt became more ambulatory with physical therapy.
.
# Hypotension: Was likely [**12-24**] dehydration due to infection. It
resolved with IVF.
.
# Chronic systolic CHF: Patient has EF of 45%. Received 4L IV
fluids in ED and 2.5L in MICU. Pt was noted to have bilat
plerual effusions on CXR. Pt showed no symptoms or findings on
physical exam to indicate volume overload.
.
# CAD s/p MI in [**2106**], PTCA in [**2124**]: EKG was unchanged from
baseline. Pt had no chest pain during stay. Pt was continued on
home ASA, Atorvastatin, Plavix.  Pt's home Metoprolol was
initially held due to hypotension, but then restarted the day
prior to discharge.
.
# Dementia: Stable, pt was continued on home Donepezil.
.
# BPH: Stable, pt was initally with Foley which was subsequently
removed.  Pt was continued on home Finasteride and Oxybutynin.
.
# Pt was on a cardiac healthy diet, (soft solids, thin liquids,
small pills whole with puree, large pills crushe
