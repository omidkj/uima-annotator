Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion with early tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial tap


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 69973**] is a 32 year old man without significant past
medical history, with recent upper respiratory febrile illness
and SOB that started 10 days prior. Recently completed a course
of oral antibiotics in mid [**Month (only) **] for sinus infection, however
he continued to have SOB, productive cough, and fever. He was
diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection and possible
pneumonia (?LLL infiltrate), however that diagnosis was in
question, and he was treated with moxifloxacin.  He presented to
OSH on [**1-16**] with temperature of 103 and worsening pleuritic
chest pain and shortness of breath. Cardiac enzymes were
negative. He had a negative influenza swab. On bedside
echocardiogram was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion
1.2-1.9 cm initially and was treated with Toradol. Echo today
noted that it had increased to 2.1cm, mostly posterior, with
septal flattening. He was transferred for further evaluation and
on arrival was found to have a large pericardial effusion with
early signs of tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was performed with
opening pressure 21 mmHg and removal of 410 cc serosanguinous
fluid that was sent for laboratory evaluation which is pending.
Post-drainage pericardial pressure was 3 mmHg. His chest pain is
nearly resolved, although continues to have substernal
discomfort with deep inspiration. He has a mildly productive
cough of pink sputum. His breathing is improved but still
limited by chest discomfort.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent unintended weight loss,
chills, or nightsweats. He had no known infectious exposures. He
also denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative except per HPI above.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

[**2141-1-18**] BCx: NGTD
[**1-19**] Influenza DFA: negative
[**1-18**] Sputum Cx: respiratory flora

Pericardial fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

IMAGING:
[**1-18**] ECHO:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired
ventricular filling.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial
effusion with echocardiographic signs of early tamponade.

[**1-18**] REPEAT ECHO:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 50 %), possibly secondary to tachycardia. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Small echodense residual pericardial effusion.
Resolution of tamponade physiology.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-1-18**],
pericardial effusion is smaller and echo signs of tamponade are
no longer evident

[**1-18**] CXR:
No focal consolidation is identified, but the retrocardiac area
is dense and the left hemidiaphragm is indistinct. Pleural fluid
or
consolidation at the left base cannot be excluded. Further
evaluation with
lateral view or lateral decubitus views should be considered

[**1-19**] REPEAT ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is abnormal septal motion. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. There is significant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with
impaired ventricular filling. Cine loop #27 demonstrates
transient flattening of interventricular septum during
inspiration, suggesting ventricular interdependence and
analogous to a physical Kussmaul's sign. The echo findings are
therefore suggestive of pericardial constriction. No evidence of
cardiac tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Small residual echodense pericardial effusion.
