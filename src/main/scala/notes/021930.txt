Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service and transferred to the
trauma ICU. On initial workup she was noted to have a left
chronic subdural hemorrhage with acute blood, a proximal humerus
fracture, right inferior ramus and acetabular fracture and a
left intratrochanteric fracture. She was evaluated by
Neurosurgery for the SDH which was nonoperative. It was
recommended that a repeat head CT be done which was stable. It
was initially thought there may be a fracture of her cervical
spine at C1-C2; an MRI was done and reviewed by Neurosurgery and
no fracture was noted, just degenerative changes. The cervical
collar was removed. She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 4
weeks for a repeat head CT and will continue with the Keppra
until that time.

Orthopedics was consulted for the hip fracture; she was taken to
the operating room on [**2199-12-27**] for ORIF of the left hip.
Postoperatively she was transferred to the regular nursing unit.
It was recommended to start Lovenox for a total of 4 weeks. she
may weight bear as tolerated and will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks. Her humeral fracture was managed non
operatively with a sling.

Given her history of chronic anemia and need for monthly blood
transfusions her hematocrits were monitored closely and remained
relatively stable given her hip surgery. Last hematocrit on [**12-30**]
was 23.4 (postop Hct was 23.5 on POD #1). She is followed by her
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6164**] in [**Hospital1 **], MA.

She was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and has
been recommended for rehab after her acute hospital stay.
