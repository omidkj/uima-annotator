Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L TLC Central Line placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 61106**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for
dementia, HTN, colon CA s/p colectomy admitted on [**10-20**] for
bilateral shoulder pain for several days and tachycardia to 120s
with associated lightheadedness.  On initial presentation to the
ED, she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR with an
old LBBB and received IV diltiazem with conversion to NSR.
.
Since her admission, the patient has ruled in for NSTEMI with
peak cardiac biomarkers of CK 379, MB 61, and TnT 1.43 ([**10-20**],
11:55 pm).  She was started on ASA, plavix, heparin gtt,
metoprolol, losartan, plavix, and atorvastatin.  In addition,
the patient was noted to be hypertensive to SBP 170s, so was
placed on a nitro gtt.  Of note, initial family was held with
the decision for the patient to be made DNR/DNI with medical
management and no cardiac catheterization.  This morning, the
patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 35.4 from 40, and this
evening she was noted to several large grossly blood bowel
movements with associated hypotension with a SBP nadir in the
60s with a hct of 29.2.  She was also noted to have
approximately 50 cc of hematemesis.  After discussion with the
family, the patient was initially confirmed to be DNR/DNI with
the additional decision for no escalation of care.  However,
this was changed upon further discussion with the [**Hospital1 1516**] team with
the decision to place a CVL and consult GI for possible
endoscopy/colonscopy.  She received 4L IVF and 2 units PRBC on
the floor with improvement in her BP from 90s/60s to 180/100,
and was transferred to the CCU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without
complaints. Denies any CP/SOB,f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias. She
denies recent fevers or chills. All of the other review of
systems negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems was significant for absence of dyspnea
on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema.

Imaging:
ECHO [**2108-10-22**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output
and increased stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation. Mild to
moderate ([**1-27**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of
the mitral valve chordae. There is systolic anterior motion of
the mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
systolic function. There is a mild left ventricular resting
outflow gradient. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate estimated pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

CT Head [**2108-10-23**]
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
2. Small chronic lacunar infarction in the left lentiform
nucleus. Moderate chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

CXR [**2108-10-24**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, today's
radiograph shows slightly increased interstitial markings as
well as newly appeared Kerley B lines. Overall, the changes
suggest increased interstitial fluid content consistent with
moderate pulmonary edema. The size of the cardiac silhouette is
unchanged. On the right, the costophrenic sinus is blunted,
there might be a small pleural effusion. No newly acquired focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged course and
position of the central venous access line.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pre-ICU Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx significant for HTN, colon CA (s/p
colectomy), hearing loss, and mild dementia who presented with
new-onset atrial fibrillation that was noted at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on
the morning of presentation. Converted back to sinus rhythm
after administration of IV diltiazem.

# Atrial Fibrillation / NSTEMI - On arrival to the floor, the
patient was back in sinus rhythm.  The patient denied any
current or previous chest pain.  A TSH was sent and was within
normal limits.  Additionally, cardiac enzymes were followed.
The first set of cardiac enzymes showed a slight elevation of
troponin to 0.10, which was initially attributed to demand
ischemia in the setting of a.fib with RVR.  However, overnight,
the patient's second set of cardiac enzymes showed a significant
rise.  Troponin was now 1.43.  The patient was loaded with
plavix, started on a heparin drip, and started on a high-dose
statin.  The following morning, the patient triggered for
hypertension to the 210's.  She was given IV labetalol and
started on a nitroglycerin drip.  Her pressure then decreased to
the 90's, but she was asymptomatic.  Nitroglycerin drip was
stopped.  The [**Hospital 228**] medical situation was discussed with the
family and the decision was made to likely not pursue cardiac
catheterization
