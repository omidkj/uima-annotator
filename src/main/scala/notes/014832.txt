Chief Complaint:
found down, s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of chest tube, [**2147-9-6**]

History of Present Illness:
77F h/o metastatic NSCLCa, on chemotherapy, s/p XRT to C/T spine
due vertebral mets and cord compression, who was brought to the
ED today after being found down in cardiac arrest at her
[**Hospital3 **]. The pt was reportedly in her baseline state of
health earlier in the day when she was seen by her family. She
was later found by staff unresponsive. She was reportedly in
asystole. CPR and ACLS were initiated and the pt was converted
to PEA. In the ambulance, the pt again developed PEA, which
converted to sinus tach with additional CPR, epinephrine and
atropine. On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were HR 112 and
BP 117/56. The pt was intubated for airway protection and
started on pressors to support her blood pressure. Central
venous access was obtained. CT scans of the chest and abd were
obtained which demonstrated a large left sided PTX without
evidence of tension, as well as air tracking down into the abd.
A chest tube was placed and surgical consultation was requested;
surgery felt the pt was not an operative candidate. The pt was
then admitted to the MICU for further care. A family meeting was
held with four of her five children, who expressed that it would
be her wishes not have prolonged measures to sustain her life.

.
Admission Chest CTA:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Large left pneumothorax with apical and basilar components
and extensive
subcutaneous air tracking along the left chest wall.
3. Numerous bilateral rib deformities consistent with
nondisplaced fractures.
4. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass
attenuation
throughout the lungs suggestive of pulmonary edema. Nodular
areas of ground
glass attenuation in the perihilar regions and right lung base
could reflect
sequela from aspiration.
5. Multiple hypodense liver lesions, incompletely imaged.
6. Moderate pneumoperitoneum and retroperitoneum which could be
more fully
characterized on the subsequent abdominal CT.
.
Admission Abd CT:
1. Air from left pneumothorax tracks along the subcutaneous
tissues and
results in pneumoperitoneum and pneumoretroperitoneum.
2. Anasarca.
3. No bowel obstruction.
4. Diffuse metastases as seen on prior studies.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the MICU for monitoring and treatment.
Her dire prognosis, including the likelihood of significant
anoxic brain injury, was communicated early on to her family.
The pt's family expressed that the pt would not have wanted
protracted measures to extend her life. On the first full
hospital day, the pt was noted to develop significant
bradycardia and hypertension thought to represent possible
cerebral herniation. The pt was briefly hyperventilated to allow
an additional family member to arrive; at that time, artificial
ventilation was withdrawn and the pt was made comfortable with a
morphine infusion. She expired shortly thereafter.
