Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5037**]
Chief Complaint:
fever during dialysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
interventional radiology hemodialysis catheter removal
interventional radiology tunneled hemodialysis catheter
placement


History of Present Illness:
61 yo F child psychiatrist w/ complicated PMH significant for
type 1 IDDM (s/p revision renal and pancreas transplants, [**2160**]
and [**2174**]), diastolic CHF (Echo 35-40%, [**7-/2181**]), recurrent MDR E
coli UTIs, chronic anemia, currently on dialysis for repeated
hyperkalemia, who developed fevers during dialysis on [**2181-11-5**].
.
Pt states that she was feeling completely normal up until
dialysis. Over the last three months, she has had a complicated
course w/ multiple admissions, most recently [**Date range (1) 17774**], w/
HCAP and worsening CHF during which she was intubated. Pt has
since been at [**Hospital3 **] since than and recently discharged
to [**Hospital 10246**] Rehab in [**Location 1268**], where she has slowly been
making progress in her recovery.
.
Pt received dialysis on Monday, [**2181-11-5**], as usual and was found
to be febrile and have chills. Dialysis was terminated early.
Per her most recent nephrology note from [**2181-10-29**], her renal
graft seemed to be working better, with Cr 2.0, and a tentative
plan to wean off dialysis. Pt denies any localizing symptoms
prior to Monday.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], Pt was initially not very responisve and triggered on
arrival for altered mental status with fever 103 and HR 130. UA
was bland, UCx and Blood Cx pending. Pt was given Vancomycin 1g,
Levofloxacin 750mg, and Metronidazole 500mg, stress dose
steroids (methylprednisolone 125mg) and fluid bolus (amount not
documented). Pt had a good response w/ lactate correcting from
2.9 to 2.2, HR 90, and marked improvement in mental status. By
report, she had nausea, lower abdominal pain and dysuria. Pt's
CXR was significnat for small bilateral pleural effusions and
interval marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Bedside
Echo did not show any significant pericardial effusion. Pt had a
non-contrast CT abd which showed dilated fluid-filled loops of
small bowel in RLQ and midline pelvis w/ some fecalized loops
concerning for partial small bowel, colon full of stool, and
normal appearing LLQ transplanted kidney. Transplant surgery was
called and had low suspicion for obstruction w/ recommendation
of serial abdominal exams and repeat imaging w/ po contrast if
worsening exam or symptoms. Pt was admitted for fever of unknown
origin workup.
.
On arrival to the floor, Pt's vitals were 99.2F, 117/60, HR 94,
RR 18, sat 100% 2L. Pt has no pain at all, except for a "sharp
pain" near her urethra.

ROS: No fevers, no chills (aside from dialysis session on
Monday), no night sweats, no changes in weight. No cough, no
SOB, no chest pain, no palpitations. No nausea, no vomiting, no
diarrhea or constipation. Pt states that she normally has 3 BM
daily and that she has been regular. Her last BM was 4pm 1d
prior to admission.

Past Medical History:
1. diastolic CHF (preserved EF 35%, moderate regional
systolic dysfunction, [**9-/2181**])
2. s/p renal transplant ([**2157**], complicated by chronic rejection,

second transplant [**2160**])
3. s/p pancreas transplant (with allograft pancreatectomy
[**5-/2174**], redo transplant [**6-/2175**], acute rejection [**7-/2180**] which
resolved with increased immunosuppresion)
4. diabetes mellitus type I (complicated by neuropathy,
retinopathy, dysautonomia, no longer requires regular insulin
after pancreas transplant)
5. autonomic neuropathy
6. sleep-disordered breathing (on 2L NC nighttime, unable to
tolerate CPAP)
7. osteoporosis
8. hypothyroidism
9. pernicious anemia
10. cataracts
11. glaucoma
12. anemia from chronic kidney disease (on Aranesp previously)
13. Right foot fracture, complicated by RLE DVT
14. chronic LLE edema
15. Reucrrent MDR E.coli pyelonephritis
16. s/p anal polypectomy ([**5-/2176**])
17. s/p bilateral trigger finger surgery ([**8-/2178**])
18. s/p left [**Year (4 digits) 6024**] ([**8-/2179**])
19. CAD s/p DES to LAD [**9-/2181**]

Social History:
Child psychiatrist, on disability. Lives alone in [**Hospital1 8**], MA,
but has been in various rehabs since her 3 wk hospitalization in
[**2181-9-22**] (see HPI), most recently [**Hospital 17775**] Rehab. Mobilizes w/
wheelchair but has a new prosthesis that doesn't fit well.
Denies tobacco use or alcohol use; no recreational substance

arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise

non-contributory.
