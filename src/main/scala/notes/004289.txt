Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Falling Hct

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
85yF with h/o CAD, CHF, COPD tx from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for low
Hct and evidence of peri-hepatic hematoma on CT scan.  In brief,
she presented to OSH with abd pain, found to have free air on
CXR.  Taken to OR and found to have large perforated gastric
ulcer as well as an ischemia perforation of the distal ileum.
She underwent a hemigastrectomy with Roux en Y as well as a SBR.
 She developed multiple episodes of resp distress post-op and
had several extubations followed by emergent re-intubations.  A
collection was found peri-hepatic.  A CT guided drainage was
performed, which probably resulted in a liver injury.  She
continued to have falling Hcts, and was resuscitated with PRBCs.
 The collection itself grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and GNRs.  She
also had gram positive cocci in her blood, likely from a line.
She was on linezolid, zosyn, and caspofungin on transfer.  The
patient was transferred to our hospital for falling hematocrits
with evidence of a likely peri-hepatic hematoma.

CT abd [**2114-2-22**]:
1.  Large 15 x 10 cm heterogeneous subcapsular liver mass/high
attetuation
fluid collection. Given the relatively high attenuation of this
mass and the clinical history of recent biopsy, its appearance
is consistent with hematoma and would not be amenable to
drainage. A few foci of gas are noted within this collection,
likely due to recent procedure but underlying infection cannot
be excluded.
2.  Status post Roux-en-Y procedure without evidence of
obstruction. Extensive peripancreatic inflammatory change likely
post-surgical.
3.  Evidence of volume overload including large bilateral
pleural effusions, anasarca, and intra-abdominal fluid.
4.  Right-sided aortic arch.
5. NGT in good position

FISTULOGRAM/SINOGRAM [**2-28**]: Enterocutaneous fistula with contrast
collecting within an amorphous extraintestinal space before
entering small bowel

CT GUIDANCE DRAINAGE [**2-28**]: Successful CT-guided pigtail catheter
placement into the patient's intraperitoneal fluid collection

RENAL U.S. [**2-27**]:Mild bilateral renal cortical thinning, without
evidence of hydronephrosis.

ECHO [**2-22**]:
left atrium is mildly dilated. mild symmetric LVH.  LV systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). No aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation.  MV leaflets are mildly thickened. No
MVP.  TV leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: The patient was off of sedation and became arousable
shortly after admission.  She was kept off sedation other than
prn doses for comfort.  Her neurological status deteriorated
late in her hospital course

Cardio: Echo at admission showed a hyperdynamic heart with an EF
of 70-80%.  Initially she required no pressors, but as her
multi-organ failure progressed she required norepinephrine
and/or neosynephrine to maintain her blood pressure.  Towards
the end of her hospital course the family decided not to
escalate her pressor requirements.  Eventually, her BPs were
unable to be maintained and she expired on [**2114-3-5**].

Pulm: She was unable to wean from controlled ventilation.  She
was attempted on pressure support multiple times but became very
tachypneic and demonstrated low tidal volumes during these
trials.  Her CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema and pleural
effusions.

FEN: She was maintained on her TPN that she arrived with.  Her
nutrition labs were checked weekly.  Per renal, her diuresis was
limited due to her ARF.  She was initially kept on LR, then
switched to MFs, and then KVO in order to maintain an even fluid
balance.  The patient had significant anasarca.  Her arms wept
almost a liter of fluid a day which was collected in drainage
bags.

GI: Her dobhoff was removed as it was non-functional in its
position.  Tube feeds were resumed but down her OGT.  She did
have some issues tolerating these with higher residuals and her
TFs were held appropriately at these times.  She was continued
on Protonix for GI prophylaxis.  She eventually was found to
have developed an EC fistula through one of her open wounds on
her abdomen.  A pigtail was placed in this and allowed to drain.

GU: Her BUN/Cr were elevated at admission and continued to
slowly trend up.  Renal was consulted.  They recommended that we
try to maintain a even fluid balance, and avoid diuresis.  They
recommended albumin for fluid if needed.  They believed her ARF
was of multiple etiology including: sepsis, hypotension,
contrast etc.  They did not believe dialysis was needed at this
time but continued to follow.

Heme: Her Hct was stable at admission but slowly trended down.
Her platelets and WBC also slowly trended down.  It was believed
that this was secondary to her multi-organ failure.

ID: Her antibiotics were switched to Dapto, cipro, flagyl, and
caspofungin.  These were continued through her hospital stay.
Her cultures grew out yeast and enterococcus from multiple
sources.

Endo: She was transferred with solumedrol on board.  This was
stopped after transfer.  Her blood sugars were relatively stable
throughout her hospital course and did not require an insulin
drip.

Eventually the patients family made her DNR.  A few days later
they decided to not escalate care and she expired shortly after.
