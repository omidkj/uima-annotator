Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
left lower lobe nodule, concerning for metastatic colon cancer.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2174-1-14**]: Left VATS converted to left thoracotomy, basilar
segmentectomy of the left lower lobe. Mediastinal lymph node
dissection.
[**2174-1-18**]: Right right brachial 35 cm PICC line placement
[**2174-1-25**]: Percutaneous tracheostomy.
          Placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a woman with
metastatic colon cancer to the left lower lobe.  The lesion
was 4 cm in size and was not able to be resected by a
wedge resection.  The patient had limited pulmonary reserve
due to longstanding bronchiectasis in the lingula.  We
discussed the options of surgery versus radiosurgery. Given
the size of the tumor we felt that local control would be
best achieved by surgical resection.

CXR [**2174-1-29**]:
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient with
thoracotomy.

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to [**1-28**], [**2173**].

Tracheostomy is in place with its tip being 5.5 cm above the
carina. There is no change in the left lower lung atelectasis
and widespread parenchymal
consolidations seen throughout the lungs. The right PICC line is
in place,
unchanged. Multiple clips projecting over the mediastinum are
unchanged as
well.

IMPRESSION: No short-term interval change

CXR [**2174-1-31**]:
Mild pulmonary edema improved. Small left pleural effusion-
stable. R PICC upper SVC. increased gas in abdomen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known firstname 4134**] [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room on [**2174-1-14**] by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for a left VATS converted to left thoracotomy, basilar
segmentectomy of the left lower lobe and mediastinal lymph node
dissection for metastatic colon cancer. She recovered in the
PACU, where anesthesia placed an epidural for better pain
control.  BAL from OR bronch grew 4+ PMNs and 4+ GNR and she was
started on antipseudomonal coverage in PACU. She was
subsequently transferred to SICU for close observation of
respiratory function. Below is a systems review of her hospital
course:

Neurologic/Pain:
