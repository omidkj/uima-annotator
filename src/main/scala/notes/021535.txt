CXR [**3-27**]
Compared with one day earlier and allowing for technical
differences, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are
patchy opacities throughout both lungs and left lower lobe
collapse and/or consolidation, with obscuration of the medial
portion of the left hemidiaphragm. The patient is status post
sternotomy, with skin staples. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is widened but unchanged. No gross effusion is identified. A
right IJ sheath is present, stable in position. No pneumothorax
is detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was seen by orthopedics for his shoulder pain. Aspiration was
performed and was negative. Shoulder MRI showed Mild
tendinopathy of the supraspinatus tendon without tear. He was
seen by psychiatry for a question of drug seeking behavior, with
recommendations to add ativan and consult the pain service, who
recommended neurontin, and NSAIDs, and increased narcotics.
Cardiac catheterization on [**3-20**] shoee no flow limiting CAD. He
was seen by neurology for transient visual loss, a Head and neck
CTA was negative, and carotid u/s was negative as well. He was
cleared by dental for surgery. He was taken to the operating
room on [**2158-3-24**] where he underwent a replacement of his
ascending aorta. He was taken back to the operating room later
that same day for bleeding. He was extubated later that same
day. He continued to be seen by pain service post op and a PCA
was started. He was transferred to the floor on POD #3. Pain

and long acting oxycodone. He received 1 unit PRBCs for an HCT
of 20. He was seen in consulatation by electrophysiology for
some pauses and bradycardia to the 30s which were felt to be
vagal, recommendations included [**Doctor Last Name **] of hearts monitor and EP

artificial tears were prescribed. He was ready for discharge
