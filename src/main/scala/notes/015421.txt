Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Found Down and suggestion of adventitious apendicular movements.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated briefly for one night.


History of Present Illness:
75F transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for likely seizure
activity.  Could not obtain hx from either pt or husband (cannot
reach him by phone), so much of following history is from
neurology.  Around 9:30AM, pt went to the bathroom.  Awhile
later, husband entered bathroom and found pt slumped over.  He
called 911.  Prior to EMS arrival, pt had episode of limb
shaking for a few minutes, which stopped when he touched her
arm.  Husband denied that she had any incontinence or tongue
biting.  Husband told neurologist that pt has not been herself
over the last 3-4 days, with pacing and difficulty with tasks.
Pt denies HA, visual changes, N/V, fevers, chills, night sweats,
or bowel/bladder incontinence.  Pt has no h/o prior seizures.
.
Pt was initially taken to [**Hospital3 3583**] ED, where she was
intubated and started on dilantin.  She was unresponsive.
Sodium was 160 reportedly (no electrolytes in the records they
sent), was given 1/2NS.  EMS noted seizure activity and gave pt
Valium.  At OSH, head CT was negative for bleed.  She was
transferred here for further management.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was given ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and flagyl.
Acyclovir ordered.  Neurology evaluated pt, and recommended EEG,
LP, and MRI/MRA.  LP obtained in ED.

Past Medical History:
bipolar disorder
hypertension
hypothyroidism
skin cancer
osteoporosis

Social History:
Lives with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] in ADLs, Smoked 60 pack years
but quit 1 year ago.

Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:
VS:  101.4  110/70  104  14  98% on AC 550x14/0.7/5
Gen: intubated, sedated
HEENT: PERRL, ETT in place
CV: RRR, nl S1/S2, no murmurs appreciated
Pulm: coarse upper airway sounds anteriorly but clear
Abd: soft, NT/ND, +BS, no masses; NG tube in place and to
suction
Ext: no c/c/e
Neuro: sedated, increased tone in lower extremities, toes
neither up nor downgoing, PERRL


Pertinent Results:
EKG: 80bpm, NSR, nl axis and intervals, no ST/T wave changes
suggestive of ischemia
.
CXR: no evidence of aspiration
.
CT C spine: No evidence of acute fracture or gross malalignment
of the cervical spine.  Bilateral posteriorly seen atelectasis
as described above.
.
CT head: chronic small vessel infarcts, no acute process
.
CT chest: IMPRESSION: Multifocal pulmonary consolidation most
readily explained by pneumonia particularly aspiration. Followup
advised to exclude the simultaneous presence of
bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma.
It would be useful to obtain a chest radiograph today to
correlate with the CT findings In order to determine the rate of
change of the multifocal pulmonary abnormality seen.
.
MRI Head:IMPRESSION:
1. Edema within the C6 and C7 vertebral bodies, without
associated edema of the C6/7 intervertebral disc. The finding
could be degenerative in nature, though other etiologies of
marrow edema cannot be entirely excluded, such as infection,
although the absence of disc T2 hyperintense signal argues
against this possibility.
2. Small disc osteophyte complexes at C5/6 and C6/7 indent the
thecal sac without mass effect on the spinal cord at these
levels.
.
CXR PA/LAT [**2197-3-15**] -
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in the appearance of
the lungs since [**2197-3-12**]. Right upper lung opacity is also
stable. Continued short-interval followup is recommended.
.
EEG [**3-13**] - IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG in the
waking and sleeping states. No focal or epileptiform features
were seen.

ECHO [**2197-3-14**] - IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.  Mild mitral regurgitation. No
structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
.
Carotid U/S [**2197-3-15**] - IMPRESSION: Normal study.

Brief Hospital Course:
What follows is a hospital course by problem:
[**Name (NI) **] recieved a complete syncope, seizure and meningitis
workup.  This workup as detailed below did not identify a clear
etiology.  Our hypothesis is thus neurocardiogenic syncope in
the setting of micturation.
.
1. Telemetry failed to identify arrhythmia.
2. CT head normal except for chronic small vessel infarcts.
3. An LP revealed wbc 2, RBC 0. protein 41, glucose 85. CSF HSF
HSV PCR negative.  Was treated empirically with Acyclovir.  CSF
was culture negative.
4. MRI/MRA was performed to evaluate for possible CVA, but
revealed no evidence of acute infarct. Possible NPH - seems
unlikely in setting of mild gait abnormality and no Urinary
symptoms. Also patient didn't get any reported relief from LP.
5. Treated with levofloxacin for PNA posteriorly seen on CT scan
and CXR. Currently Day 7.  Needs a total of 10 days.
6. EEG - normal.  Was maintained briefly on phenytoin.
7. Carotid Duplex - normal.
8. Cardiac Echo - No structural cardiac cause of syncope
identified.
9. Cardiac enzymes negaive.  orthostatics vital signs normal.
.
Regarding hypoxemic respiratory failure - Patient was intubated
at outside hospital for airway protection, as she was reported
as unresponsive on her initial presentation. On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**], she did have significant A-a gradient with PO2 in 170s on
FIO2 70%. Extubated after 1 day without any problems.
1. hypoxia resolved.
2. urinary Legionella antigen: negative.
3. on levoquin for poss infiltrate (as above), but looks better
on CXR [**3-12**].
4. CT chest shows PNA and possible BAC cancer - will follow
nodule as outpatient - radiology reports will accompany the
patient.
.
Patient intially complaining of neck pain, but subsequently
reported that this was a long term/stable issue. Patient did
have midline TTP on exam. Cervical collar was placed. CT c spine
negative; MRI negative but did show edema of cervical vertebrae.
 Advise outpatient follow up. Radiology reports will accompany
the patient.
5. cleared C-spine [**3-13**]
6. Cervical verterbral edema will be communicated to PCP.
.
Patient has diagnosis of depression - held bupropion because of
concern for seizure.  Will restart after d/c
.
Hypothyroidism - Patient found to have elevated TSH despite
normal T4
- increase dose of levothyroxine to 150mcg qd.  PCP should check
TSH in 6 weeks.
