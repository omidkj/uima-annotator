Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation x2
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
67y/o M with a PMH of DM type 2, [**Hospital3 9642**] mechanical [**Hospital3 1291**]
([**2168**]), Ascending aorta repair with graft ([**2168**]),CAD, s/p
CABG,hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**], recurrent high grade CoNS
and VRE BSI s/p removal of leads who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
shortness of breath. He was discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team on [**9-17**],
and presents again complaining of shortness of breath.
.
His last admission was primarily for pseudomonas urosepsis,
which was complicated by acute pulmonary edema in the setting of
systolic heart failure s/p intubation x3. Exacerbations are
thought to be secondary to hypertension and not acute ischemia.
Overall he was diuresed >12kg during that admission, and
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-17**].
.
On [**9-18**], he presented from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital6 12736**]
complaining of suddent onset dyspnea when he woke up this
morning.  On arrival to OSH ED, ABG 7.36/47/68.  He was placed
on CPAP en route, and received 80mg IV Lasix, with 100cc urine
output.
.
He was started on dopamine at OSH ED at 10/hour, and
transitioned to levophed at OSH ICU.  Levophed was 5mcg/min, and
patient had systolic BPs in 90s.  He got 500mg Gentamicin x1.
He was transitioned to 50% venti mask, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
at patient's request.

.
Currently, patient continues to feel short of breath. He denies
any chest pain, palpitations, fevers, or chills. He denies any
dysuria or urinary frequency.  Last BM yesterday. No diarrhea.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,  palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

CXR on admission [**9-18**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs
evocative of
pulmonary edema have slightly decreased. However, today's image
shows a
typical presentation of mild-to-moderate persisting pulmonary
edema with
cardiomegaly, increased vascular markings, increased
reticulations and a
borderline width of the right mediastinum. Minimal blunting of
the left
costophrenic sinus but cannot exclude the presence of a small
pleural
effusion. No focal parenchymal opacities have newly occurred.
Unchanged
alignment of sternal wires after sternotomy. Status post
valvular
replacement. The PICC line projects with its tip over the
superior SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
67y/o M with a PMH of DM type 2, [**Hospital3 9642**] mechanical [**Hospital3 1291**]
([**2168**]), Ascending aorta repair with graft ([**2168**]),CAD, s/p CABG,
hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**], recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE
BSI who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and
hypotension, found to be in acute exacerbation of chronic
systolic and diastolic CHF with flash pulmonary edema x2
requiring ventilation.
.
# CHF exacerbation with episodes of flash pulmonary edema:
Patient presented with fluid overload, exacerbation of well
known systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 20%).  Med nonadherence
unlikely as pt presented from rehab facility.  Patient was
diuresed aggressively with Lasix gtt, and was initially on
nitrates for vasodilation.  However, when pt's SBP>100, he had
flash pulmonary edema and needed intubation two times during
this admission.  Captopril was initiated (in place of his
Lisinopril, which was initially held for low BP) with the goal
of aggressive afterload reduction, and pt was maintained at
SBP<100.  Patient was also initiated on Torsemide and Diuril prn
(received 1 dose so far) after Lasix drip was d/c'ed to keep him
negative 0.5-1L/day to prevent volume overload and flash
pulmonary edema.  <<*****He should continue to be diuresed to
his dry weight on Torsemide and Diuril prn.*****>> Patient's
flash pulmonary edema is also suspected to be related to vagal
episodes with straining for bowel movements, and he is on an
aggressive bowel regimen, which should only be decreased if the
patient develops diarrhea.  <<*****Please maintain aggressive
bowel regimen.*****>>  <<*****Please do NOT hold
anti-hypertensive regimen (Captopril, Metoprolol) for SBP <80.
Patient has flash pulmonary edema with SBP >100.*****>>
.
#  Hypotension: BP 80s/50s at OSH, on Levophed initially, then
weaned off. Initially believed to be [**1-26**] acute pulmonary edema
and poor forward flow vs. sepsis (as pt had recent urosepsis and
recently completed a 14 day course of meropenem for pseudomonas
UTI).  UCx grew Klebsiella, BCx were negative, patient was
treated with Meropenem.  Patient appe
