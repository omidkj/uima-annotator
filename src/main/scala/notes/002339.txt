Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ibandronate Sodium / Actonel / Hydrochlorothiazide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11740**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with a history of HTN who
presents with SOB and fever. She went to her PCP yesterday with
complaint of several days of SOB and non productive cough. She
did not have wheezes and was not hypoxic. She was given
amoxicillin for suspected bronchitis. Tonight she presented to
the ED due to progressive respiratory distress.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 101.5 HR 88 BP 160/110 RR24
O2Sat:100. The patient was tachypneic and very wheezy despite no
COPD/asthma history. She received nebs and methylprednisolone. A
chest X ray showed an opacity so she was given ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin. Given poor response to above, she was placed on
BiPAP and was noted to have a breif episode of hypotension to
the 70s which resolved with 500 cc NS bolus. She was sent for a
CTA, which revealed a moderate pericardial effusion showing
effusive constrictive pattern but no tamponade. An echo was
obtained which showed a moderate pericardial effusion without
signs of tampenade. The patient also had a run of SVT to 150s,
which converted with adenosine. She also complained of some
intermittient abdominal discomfort, but her abdomen was soft and
she was guaiac negative. Vitals prior to transfer were: 99
136/78 24 100% on 100% FiO2 BiPAP
.
On review of systems, she states that she fell out of her bed 3
days ago due to "weakness." She denies hitting her head or
hurting herself, but was on the floor for a while before she
could get help. She also admits to poor PO intake due to
anorexia and chills for the last week. She denies any chest
pain, palpitations (even in the ed witht the SVT), syncope,
orthopnea, ankle edema, prior history of deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, myalgias, black stools or red stools.

Pertinent Results:
[**2110-5-2**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. The echo findings are
suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.

IMPRESSION: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion
without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2110-5-2**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Portable upright AP view of the chest is obtained.
Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant. Low lung volumes
limit evaluation, as does the portable AP technique. The heart
appears mildly enlarged allowing for technical limitations.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. There is slight
increase in retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis
versus early pneumonia. There is note made of Kerley B lines
suggesting mild fluid overload. Mediastinal contour is
prominent, which may be related to unfolded thoracic aorta.
Degenerative changes are severe at both shoulders. There is a
dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, apex along the upper
lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, mild fluid overload, small bilateral
pleural
effusions. Probable left lower lobe atelectasis, less likely
pneumonia.

[**2110-5-2**] CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large pericardial effusion, apparently new compared to chest
radiograph
[**2109-2-5**].
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, possibly related to hydrostatic
edema but
not specific for this process.
4. Mild hydrostatic edema, with small bilateral pleural
effusions, left
slightly larger than right.
5. Scattered sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules. Given the patient's
advanced age,
follow- up is likely not warranted if there is no history of a
primary
malignancy.
6. Focal opacity in the right lung apex, which appears to have
been present on chest radiograph of [**2109-2-5**], and most likely
reflects a scar. However, serial chest radiographs could be
considered to exclude indolent infection if warranted
clinically.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11740**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with past medical history of HTN and
recent symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia who presented
to the ED with fever and SOB and was found to have pericardial
effusion and atypical cells on diff suggestive of blasts.
.
# Acute leukemia: Patient's initial labs showed anemia,
thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis which was concerning for
hematological malignancy.  Her diff showed 40 "other" cells
which were eventually found to be blasts.  She was also found to
have a pericardial effusion which was thought to be malignant.
Heme/onc was consulted and - given the patient??????s age and poor
prognosis with leukemia - a family meeting was held to determine
whether or not she should have a confirmatory bone marrow biopsy
and undergo chemotherapy.  It was decided not to undergo a bone
marrow biopsy and chemotherapy was not consistent with her goals
of care.  It was decided that the patient would go to her
daughter's home with hospice.
.
# Pericardial effusion: In the ED the patient underwent CTA for
her dyspnea and was found to have evidence of moderate sized
pericardial effusion.  She underwent bedside echo which
confirmed this. Pulsus paradoxus was not elevated at 10 mm hg
and she had no evidence of hemodynamic compromise (although she
did have transient hypotension in the ED that was responsive to
a small bolus of IV fluids).  The initial differential diagnosis
included malignant versus infective pericarditis with effusion.
Uremic or autoimmune disease was less likely given no history of
autimmune disease and normal BUN.  Given the presence of blasts
on peripheral blood, and no ST changes on EKG or elevated
troponin, it was thought that the effusion was most likely
malignant.  Heme/Onc was consulted and it was decided not to
pursue fluid diagnosis with pericardiocentesis given comfort
goals as stated above.
.
# Shortnes of breath: The patient presented with complaint of
worsening dyspnea.  Her chest x ray showed evidence of
cardiomegally with widened mediastinum and cephalization of
blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent with
pulmonary vascular congestion.  This was thought to be due to
poor forward left ventricular ejection possibly due to the
pericardial effusion versus diastolic dysfunction.  She was
started on BiPAP as she was hypoxic, and this improved her O2
sats and tachycardia.  She was weaned overnight to O2 by nasal
cannula.  She was also found to be febrile to 101 in the ED so
she was given levofloxacin.  This was continued initially, but
was stopped in the CCU as the patient was no longer febrile and
it was not thought that she had a pneumonia,
