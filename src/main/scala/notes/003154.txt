RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2134-7-28**] 8:37 AM
CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: evaluate effusion
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman s/p VR.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
STUDY: PA and lateral chest [**2134-7-28**].
HISTORY: 75-year-old woman status post MVR. Patient with pleural
effusion.
FINDINGS: The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. Median
sternotomy wires are seen. There is again seen a left
retrocardiac opacity and a left-sided pleural effusion. There is
some atelectasis at the right base and a small right-sided
pleural effusion. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
Overall, the findings are stable.

obtained from 2D
images. Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Severely
depressed LVEF.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Focal calcifications
in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic  valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral
annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

[1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic  (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify  I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related  complications. The patient was
under general anesthesia throughout the  procedure. The patient
appears to be in sinus rhythm. Emergency study. Results  were
Conclusions:
PRE CPB The pre-bypass study was limited by the fact that the
patient became unstable and was quickly and urgently placed on
bypass.
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall  left
ventricular systolic function is severely, globally depressed.
There maybe worse function of the septum. Right ventricular
chamber size and free  wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed.  There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The posterior
leafllet of the mitral valve is moderately to severely thickened
and moderately immobilized. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly
thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Post-CPB The patient is receiving norepinephrine, epinephrine,
and milrinone by infusion. There is normal right ventricular
systolic function. Left ventricular systolic function is
markedly improved. The ejection fraction is  in the range of
40%. Poor acoustic windows prevent the exclusion of a regional
wall motion abnormality. There is a bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. It appears well seated. The leaflets are only very
poorly seen and their function can not be commented on. The
effective orifice area (EOA) is about 1.2 cm2 and the maximum
gradient is about 38 mm Hg with a cardiac output near 6 l/m.
These  numbers indicate an EOA slightly less than expected.
There is very trace valvular AI. A perivalvular jet is not
obvious but poor windows prevent complete exclusion. The
thoracic aorta appears intacy.
