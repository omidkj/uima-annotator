HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 76 year old exercise
physiologist has a known history of coronary artery disease
for many years.  He has been managed medically.  He had a
recent increase in symptoms of chest pain and pressure and
has been able to exercise regularly without symptoms.
Cardiac catheterization was done which revealed an LVEDP of
20, 3 to 4 plus aortic insufficiency with dilated aortic
root, 90 percent proximal left anterior descending lesion, 80
percent diagonal lesion, 50 percent left circumflex lesion
and 70 percent OM1 lesion with diffuse disease of the right
coronary artery and a 50 percent posterior descending
coronary artery lesion.  An echocardiogram revealed a normal
ejection fraction of 3 to 4 plus aortic insufficiency, mild
MR, TR, PI, and an ascending aorta of 3.9 cm.  He is now
admitted for AVR and CABG.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease,
aortic insufficiency, status post lower GI bleed due to
hemorrhoids approximately four years ago, status post left
inguinal hernia, history of bladder polyps, history of
asthma, history of cataracts, and status post repair of a
broken leg, status post hemorrhoid banding.

ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to horse serum and has many
environmental allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prinivil 40 mg P.O. every day,
Procardia XL 90 mg P.O. every day, Imdur 60 mg P.O. every
day, aspirin 81 mg P.O. every day, vitamin E 400
international units P.O. every day, Advair 150/100 every day,
multivitamin one P.O. every day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg
P.O. every day, Lipitor 10 mg P.O. every day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for bilateral hand tremor
which is benign, occasional wheezing, bilateral lower
extremity edema and he is hard of hearing.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is an elderly white male in no
apparent distress.  Vital signs stable, afebrile.  HEENT
shows normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx benign.  Neck supple, full range of
motion, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids 2 plus
and equal bilaterally without bruit.  Lungs show bilateral
wheezes with exertion.  Cardiovascular exam shows regular
rate and rhythm with a II/VI diastolic murmur.  Abdomen is
obese, soft, nontender with positive bowel sounds, no
tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are without
clubbing or cyanosis and had 2 plus pitting edema bilaterally
in the lower extremities.  Pulses were 3 plus and equal
bilaterally throughout with the exception of the popliteal
which was 2 plus bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted.  He had carotid
studies which revealed a narrowing of less than 40 percent
bilaterally.  He was seen by vascular surgery who cleared him
for surgery.  On [**2153-9-25**] the patient underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times two with left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending and reversed saphenous
vein graft to the first diagonal with a pericardial aortic
valve replacement.  He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSICU on nitro and propofol.  He was
extubated the following morning and had his chest tubes
discontinued on postoperative day number two.  He did require
intermittent atrial pacing to maintain a good cardiac index,
but this was eventually weaned.

On postoperative day three he had his epicardial pacing wires
and was transferred to the floor in stable condition.  He
continued to have a stable postoperative course and on
postoperative day five was discharged to home in stable
condition.

He did have some wheezing on postoperative day four, which we
attributed to his Lopressor which was discontinued and
changed to diltiazem.  He tolerated that well.

His labs on discharge showed white count 9,800, hematocrit
30.1, platelets 293,000, sodium 143, potassium 4.3, chloride
104, CO2 30, BUN 36, creatinine 1.3, blood sugar 102.
