[**2176-4-6**] CXR:
FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is normal. No pleural
effusions. Normal
appearance of the lung parenchyma, no evidence of pneumonia or
pulmonary
edema. No foreign bodies.
.
[**2176-4-6**] Neck, soft tissue:
FINDINGS: On the frontal image, there is no evidence of foreign
bodies and no evidence of other soft tissue abnormalities. The
lateral image shows a normal air column of the upper trachea.
The retropharyngeal space is not
substantially widened. No safe evidence of prevertebral soft
tissue swelling. However, if clinical suspicion persists, the
neck should be evaluated using cross-sectional techniques such
as CT or MRI, given the substantially increased sensitivity of
this methods.
.
[**2176-4-6**] CT chest and neck: no acute process per wet read


Brief Hospital Course:
38 yo W with anxiety/depression, asthma and multiple other
allergies who presented to the ED from her dentist's office with
concern for allergic reaction while undergoing a root canal.
Pt. was in USOH until the afternoon of admission, when while
having dental work done for an abcess in LL molar developed a
sensation of heat, pruritis and throat tightness.
.
# Possible allergic reaction.  Allergen uncertain, possibly
latex, although multiple possibilities as exposed to multiple
potential allergens while at the dentist.  Even more unclear, is
the reaction that occurred in the ED and again on the floor. As
patient was tremulous, also monitored for EtOH withdrawal. Serum
tox screen negative. Had similar brief symptoms in ICU, which
resolved quickly with Benadryl. Patient given Benadryl,
famotidine, prednisone, ipratropium. CT head, neck, and chest
showed no acute process. Soft tissue X-ray of neck also negative
for acute process. Allergy consulted: recommended steroid taper,
[**Doctor First Name **] 180mg [**Hospital1 **], standing q6h benadryl. Patient had uneventful
course on transfer to the floor where she would have "allergic
reactions" which where marked by flushing, hyperventilation, and
wheezing. These episodes responded to nebulizers and during
these events her saturation never dropped below 97% on room air.
There was a concern for malingering as patient has a known
history of substance abuse and would frequently ask for IV
benadryl.
-Steroid taper per Allergy
-Benadryl q6 and [**Doctor First Name 130**]
-Follow up at [**Hospital1 2177**] for allergen testing
.
# Asthma: Appears to be at moderate-severe. However, it is
difficult to assess the severity of her asthma as she would
smoke cigarettes in the hallway bathroom.
- Advair and ipratropium.
.
# Suspected tooth abcess.  There is some suggestion of
buccal/masticator space extension.  There is no trismus or
meningismus. Imaging not suggestive of abscess in pharyngeal or
retropharyngeal space. Dental service was called--recommendation
was that her tooth could be saved as outpatient if she goes to
clinic on Monday. The patient was treated with oxycodone for
management of her tooth pain.
- Continue clindamycin.
- Dental followup on [**2176-4-8**]

.
# Anxiety.
- Continue sertraline, gabapendin, trazodone.

Transitional Issues:
1. Smoking cessation: patient smoked in the hospital several
times when confronted about smoking she denied smoking.
2. Allergen testing: Patient will have to discontinue her
prednisone, [**Doctor First Name 130**], and benadryl prior to allergy testing for
most accurate results.
