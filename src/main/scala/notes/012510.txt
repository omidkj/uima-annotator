Chief Complaint:
Transfer from outside hospital for repeat catheterization


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
thrombin injection


History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 year-old caucasian male with a history of mild
congestive heart failure, s/p 4 previous myocardial infarctions,
s/p CABG x 4 [**2141**], s/p TIA who presented to an OSH with
dizziness, described as spinning sensation. He had been having
angina since [**2154**]. However in the past few weeks, he has had
worsening daily chest pain, releived by NTG. He was seen in OSH
ED with CP and ECG showed new LBBB. He was taken to the cath lab
and found to have chronically occluded native arteries and
posterior descending artery with 40-50% diffuse lesion. No
interventions were performed. The pt was transferred to the CCU
where he was found to have a elev in his cardiac enzymes,
peaking at - CK 271, CK-MB 43.2, trop 0.85. Initially the plan
was to continue medical therapy with asa, plavix, bb, statin and
nitrates however on evening of [**10-9**] had recurrent L sided CP
which resolved with 1 SL nitro. Patient's films reviewed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 8467**] who felt he had a tight left main that could be stented.
he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for repeat catheterization.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] floor the patient was CP free. He had no
SOB, dizziness or headache. ROS was negative. He was given
prehydration in preparation for cath on [**10-11**].

ECG [**2159-10-10**]:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION REPORT [**2159-10-11**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of the LMCA demonstrated 70%
distal
LMCA stenosis, 100% proximally occluded LAD, 70% ostial LCX
stenosis
with 80% stenosis in the AV groove branch.
2. Limited hemodynamics were performed. The systemic arterial
pressures
were normal measured 110/56mmHg.
3. Successful stenting of the LMCA with a 3.0x15mm Xience stent
that was
postdilated to 3.25mm. Final angiography revealed no residual
stenosis,
no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see
PTCA
comments).
4. Course later complicated by hematoma and pseudoaneurysm
treated with
thrombin injection.
5. Patient participated in Champion PCI study involving
randomization to
Plavix or Cangrelor.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal systemic arterial pressures.
3. Successful stenting of the LMCA into the LCX.

ECG [**2159-10-11**]:
Sinus rhythm. The tracing is marred by baseline artifact. There
is
Q-T interval prolongation. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2159-10-10**]
left bundle-branch block is no longer recorded and the rate is
slower.
A repeat tracing of diagnostic quality is suggested.

ECG [**2159-10-12**]:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch block
is new as
compared with prior tracing of [**2159-10-11**] and similar to that
recorded on [**2159-10-10**]. The presence of left bundle-branch block
may be rate-related.

Right Femoral Vascular US [**2159-10-13**]:
RIGHT FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color and pulse
wave Doppler examination was performed in the right groin
region. Examination reveals a 3.1 x 2.7 x 1.7 cm pseudoaneurysm
in the right groin, with visualization of the neck connecting
the pseudoaneurysm to the right common femoral artery. The neck
demonstrates to and fro flow, and is located slightly
superomedially along the pseudoaneurysm. Normal flow is
demonstrated in the common femoral artery. Wall-to-wall flow and
normal compressibility is demonstrated in the right common
femoral vein. Flow is also demonstrated in the greater saphenous
vein.
IMPRESSION: Pseudoaneurysm arising from right common femoral
artery as
described above.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82 year old male with history of multiple myocardial
infarctions, coronary artery bypass graft with four vein grafts
in [**2141**], and chronic angina who was found to have NSTEMI at an
outside hospital, underwent cardiac cath there demonstrating
three vessel coronary artery disease and left main stenosis. No
interventions were performed at the outside hospital and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for left main coronary artery stenting.

1) Coronary Artery Disease: Cardicac catheterization
demonstrated three vessel disease and 70% stenosis of the left
main coronary artery which was successfully stented with a drug
eluting stent.  Patient remained chest pain free throughout this
hospitalization. He was started on metoprolol and lisinopril and
will continue taking plavix, simvastatin, aspirin, and
sublingual nitroglycerin as needed. He will follow up with his
outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

2) Femoral Hematoma: Following catheterization patient developed
an expanding hematoma at access site. During this episode of
bleeding patient became bradycardic and unresponsive. He
regained responsiveness after intravenous fluid and one dose of
atropine. Hematoma was stablized and patient was transferred to
the CCU. Patient remained hemodynamically stable and was
transferred back to the cardiology floor service. On hospital
day 4 patient determined to have right femoral pseudoaneurysm
diagnosed by a femoral bruit and confirmed by ultrasound. He was
seen by the vascular surgery team who performed a thrombin
ejection on [**2159-10-15**]. At time of discharge he was ambulating
