CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2197-3-13**] 4:10 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old man with STEMI, hypoxia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval change
HISTORY: Hypoxia.

Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates marked
opacification of the bilateral lungs. Finding is unchanged when
compared with the chest radiograph obtained two hours prior.
Support lines are unchanged. No pneumothorax. The endotracheal
tube tip remains 2-3 cm above the level of the carina. There is
blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles. No pneumothorax
is appreciated. The cardiomediastinal contours are obscured. The
left diaphragmatic contour is obscured as well.

IMPRESSION:

Persistent marked opacification of the bilateral lungs. The
finding may simply represent severe pulmonary edema. Possibility
of pneumonia or even an underlying mass is not excluded given
the extensive opacification.

Support lines in place.
.
Echo [**3-13**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 15-20 %). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate LV hypertrophy. Severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis - the basal segments and
lateral wall have the least poor function. Mild global RV
hypokinesis. No significant valvular abnormality seen. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. Prior inferior myocardial infarction. Prior
anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. ST segment depressions and T wave
inversions in
leads I and aVL. Slight ST segment elevation in leads II, III,
aVF and V2-V6 as recorded on [**2197-3-13**]. The rate has increased.
Followup and clinical
correlation are suggested.

ECG
Sinus tachycardia. The previously mentioned multiple
abnormalities persist.
There is variation in precordial lead placement. The axis is
more leftward.
The T waves are now biphasic in leads V4-V6 which may represent
further
evolution of ongoing myocardial infarction. Clinical correlation
is suggested.

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA,
LAD,
and LCX were not injected.  The RCA had serial 99% lesions in
mid and
distal segments with distal PDA totally occluded.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 10 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 12 mm Hg.
There was
moderate pulomary arterial hypertension of 38/20 mm Hg.  The
cardiac
index with IABP and vasopressors was 2.5 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic Shock.
.
Echo [**3-14**]
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior
akinesis/hypokinesis and probably focal apical hypokinesis
(views suboptimal). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-3-13**],
left ventricular systolic function is improved.
