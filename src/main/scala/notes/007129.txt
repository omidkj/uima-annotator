Brief Hospital Course:
Following catheterization which revealed 4+ mitral regurgitation
and prolapse,intact LV (50%) and nonobstructive coronary
disease, preoperative workup was completed.  There was <50%
carotid disease, dental clearance was obtained and labs were
completed and reviewed.

On [**9-21**] he went to the Operating Room where mitral repair was
effected.  See operative note for details.  He weaned from
bypass on Propofol and low dose pressor.  He awakened intact,
was weaned and extubated without incident.  Atrial fibrillation
developed on POD 1 and Amiodarone was started.  This recurred
the following day and Lopressor was started with rate control
but persisitent atrial fibrillation.  Coumadin was begun for
this dysrhythmia.  Diuresis towards baseline weight was
undertaken and CTS and temporary pacing wires were removed
according to protocol.

Physical Therapy worked with him for strengthening and mobility.
 He was ready for discharge on [**9-25**]

Medications, followup and precautions were discussed with him
prior to discharge.  Arrangments were made for Coumadin dosing
to be monitored by his cardiologis as directed on the pg 1 with
a target INR of [**12-29**].5.

Pt to be discharged on 4 mg coumadin. Has follow up 11/2. His
INR on DC is 1.o
