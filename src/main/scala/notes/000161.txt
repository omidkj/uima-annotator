Radial pulses were 2+ bilaterally.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Catheterization performed on
[**2181-8-13**] revealed coronaries were without
significant stenosis.  There was significant aortic stenosis,
mild mitral regurgitation, [**Year (4 digits) 1192**] pulmonary hypertension.
The aortic valve area was 0.6 cm2 with a mean gradient
of 54 mmHg.  Ejection fraction was found to be 75%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2181-10-4**].  On the day of
admission the patient went to the operating room with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] where she had an aortic valve replacement with a
#21 [**Location (un) **] valve.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 109
minutes, and her cross-clamp times was 74 minutes.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well without any significant
complications.  Please see previously dictated Operative Note
for more details.

The patient was transferred from the operating room to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Units.  On transfer, the
patient was intubated.  The patient remained intubated when
she left the operating room and was only on a propofol drip.

On the first night after surgery the patient was extubated,
and her course was only complicated by mild hypertension
requiring a nitroglycerin drip of 0.5.  On postoperative day
one, was weaned off any vasoactive medications and was
transferred to the patient care floor.

On postoperative day two, her chest tubes were removed.  Her
Foley catheter was removed, and her postoperative course
continued to be uncomplicated.

On postoperative day three, the patient's course was
complicated by an episode of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation
with a rapid ventricular response, with a ventricular rate to
the 130s to 150s.  Intravenous Lopressor 10 mg was given with
conversion to normal sinus rate in the 60s.  At this point
the patient's magnesium level was repleted and she was loaded
with amiodarone.  The patient remained on amiodarone and
Lopressor throughout the duration of her hospitalization.
The patient's pacer wires were removed on postoperative day
four, and her course was otherwise uncomplicated.  By
postoperative day five, the patient was discharged to home
