This is a 56yoM with h/o COPD, HTN, ?esophageal stricture who
initially presented to OSH today dysphagia that began at 12pm
today. States that he was eating boneless chicken and
immediately had the sensation that food was stuck. He then
presented to a local ER 1.5-2 hours later. There, an EGD under
MAC was attempted however only fragments of food were retrieved.
After one hour, the procedure was aborted. Per report, patient
noted to have varices on EGD. Given inability to retrieve
object, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Of note, per report, patient had a similar episode that occurred
2 years ago with steak. At that time, flexible upper endoscopy
was not successful and required the OR.

12.9, Hct 48.2, Plt 267. AST/ALT 20/20, AP 78, Tbili 0.7, INR
1.0. Cr 1.0

In ED, initial VS were 98.2 73 150/88 94% 2L NP. Evaluation was
significant for WBC increased to 18.4. GI and thoracics were
consulted and planed for EGD in ICU. Patient was then intubated
in preparation for EGD with propofol, versed, etomidate, and
fentanyl for sedation. CXR did not show pneumomediastinum. IV
20g x 2. VS prior to transfer were 97.8 77 153/89.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated and sedated.

CXR: ([**7-6**])
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  The
lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is
no evidence of pneumomediastinum.  Osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of
pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.

CXR ([**7-6**])
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-6**], there is now an
endotracheal tube in place with its tip at the clavicular level,
approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  Otherwise, no interval
change or evidence of pneumonia or vascular congestion.

EGD:
Findings: Esophagus:
 Lumen: A Schatzki's ring was found in the lower third of the
esophagus.
 Mucosa: Circumferential erythma and erosions in the distal
esophagus (see photo).
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Other
findings: Food bolus had passed prior to the exam. Food bolus
was seen in the stomach. Ring was present in the distal
esophagus with active esophagitis (see photo).
Impression: Schatzki's ring
Esophagitis
Food bolus had passed prior to the exam. Food bolus was seen in
the stomach. Ring was present in the distal esophagus with
active esophagitis (see photo).
Recommendations: Repeat EGD with dilatation within 6 weeks.
Soft solid diet until repeat EGD.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITALIZATION COURSE:
56yoM with history of COPD, HTN, esophageal strictures who
presented from OSH with acute food impaction.  Food bolus had
passed into stomach by time of EGD at [**Hospital1 18**].

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Food Impaction: Acute impaction of food bolus requiring
retrieval. OSH attempt was unsuccessful prompting transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].  Given prolonged an complicated initial EGD, the patient
was electively intubated for repeat EGD at time of procedure.
EGD showed esophageal injury without perforation from prior OSH
EGD, as well as a Schatzki Ring.  Of note, original food bolus
had passed into the stomach.  Recommendations were for follow up
EGD in 6 weeks for dilation of Schatzki ring.   After procedure,
patient had a low grade temp of 99.6 F.  No clinical signs
concerning for esophageal perforation or mediastinitis.
Recommendations were made for a mechanically soft diet to be
taken for the next 6 weeks until patient undergoes esophageal
dilitation.
-GI will arrange for follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2795**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 908**] for
esophageal dilitation
-Patient provided with phone number for [**Hospital **] clinic
-Outpatient followup with PCP arranged for 24 hours of discharge

# ETOH Abuse: Per report, drinks 4-5 beers a day. No issues
regarding withdrawal in house.  CIWA unneeded.

INACTIVE ISSUES
# COPD: Continued tiotropium bromide

# Hypertension: Restarted lisinopril upon discharge from the
hospital.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because you had food stuck in your
esophagus (the structure that connects your throat to your
stomach). The gastroenterologists performed a procedure to
remove the food. When they looked however the food particle had
passed. They however did see narrowing of your esophagus that
needs to be re-evaluated and dilated.

***IT IS CRUCIAL THAT YOU SET UP A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT WITH A
GASTROENTEROLOGIST TO EVALUATE THIS NARROWING AND DILATE YOUR
ESOPHAGUS. FAILURE TO DO SO CAN RESULT IN FOOD GETTING STUCK IN
YOUR ESOPHAGUS AND RUPTURING, WHICH COULD LEAD TO DEATH.***

Because of the procedure, you needed breathing tube to help
protect your lungs. You will need to be re-evaluated by your PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 503**]. (Please see appointment below.)
