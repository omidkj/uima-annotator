Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
VT storm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation
Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy s/p CRT/D (ICD), VT on amioderone, admitted to
OSH with [**Hospital **] transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible VT ablation.
Patient is poor historian, and information taken from transfer
paperwork. Patient began to experience ICD firing 2 months prior
to presentation. At that time, he was advised to take
amioderone/mexiletine, but patient declined mexiletine due to
concern of polypharmacy. On [**12-24**], patient's ICD again fired,
and was admitted to [**Hospital 27292**] hospital. It appears that patient
was asymptomatic to VT, and only felt a premonatory fluttering
before shock. He denies any chest pain, SOB, lightheadedness, or
syncope. While admitted, patient had recurrent VT, and was
transfered to [**Hospital 33663**] Hospital for VT ablation on [**12-31**]. During
that hospitalization, he was on azithro/zosyn, but does not
appear patient had any clear infection.
.
At [**Location (un) 33663**], despite being managed on amioderone/lidocaine,
patient had recurrent VT, which was reportedly broken with both
ATP pacing and ICD firing. Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 81446**] attempted a VT
ablation. The patient became hypotensive and hypoxic during the
procedure, and case was aborted. The patient was continued on
amiodarone/lidocaine, and intially transitioned to mexiletine,
but with recurrent VT, lidocaine was re-intiated. Patient
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further manegement.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. The patient says he has been
experiencing a productive cough. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

.
CARDIOLOGY:
.
EKG [**1-3**]: Atrial sensed, ventricular paced rhythm. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
ECHO [**1-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
severely dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular
aneurysm. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and
lateral walls, as well as the distal [**1-12**] of the ventricle.
Anterior and septal wall function is relatively preserved,
though not normal (LVEF = 20-25%). The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with severe focal hypokinesis of the apical
free wall, and milder hypokinesis of the rest of the free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is bileaflet systolic tenting, secondary to LV
dilatation and chordal tension. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. A slightly eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with an inferobasal LV
aneurysm and severe regional systolic dysfunction. Regional
right ventricular dysfunction. Mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Severe
pulmonary hypertension.

Findings are overall most consistent with a prior extensive
inferoposterior and right ventricular myocardial infarction
followed by adverse LV remodeling.
.
.
RADIOLOGY:
.
[**1-3**] CXR: Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates
no interval change in the right internal jugular central venous
catheter, seen on the chest radiograph obtained nine hours
prior. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged. There is megaly. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions and mild bibasilar atelectasis. Increased airspace
opacity involving both lungs persists, although somewhat less
conspicuous than seen previously. Increased airspace opacity
involving the left lower lung corresponds to the retrocardiac
opacity seen on the previous study. The trachea is midline. No
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
Persistent mild CHF and retrocardiac opacity. Finding represents
pneumonia.
.
.
[**1-9**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Improvement of the right lung base opacity.
2. Unchanged appearance of the left lung base opacity that could
represent
aspiration pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient expired on [**2171-1-18**].

Pt is 74-y/o male with chronic CHF [**2-11**] idiopathic dilated CMP
(LVEF 20-25%) and h/o VT on amioderone s/p BiV-ICD placement,
who originally p/w VT and ICD firings to an OSH, and was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
# PUMP: Per report, hx of idiopathic dilated CMP, unknown EF
upon arrival. Patient euvolemic on exam on presentation, with no
impressive LE edema, no fluid overload on CXR, CVP at 7cm. He
was continued on his home regimen of [**Last Name (un) **], Carvedilol,
Spironolactone, and Lasix. Digoxin was held in the setting of
VT. TTE was obtained which showed EF 20-25% with akineseis of
interior, interolateral, lateral walls and distal [**1-12**] of the
ventricle as well as severe focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall of the right ventricle + moderate to severe MR (3+) and
severe pulmonary artery hypertension. He became hypotensive, was
given multiple fluid boluses, and was tranferred to the CCU for
dopamine drip.  A central line was
