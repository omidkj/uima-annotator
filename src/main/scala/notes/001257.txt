Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Scrotal abscess


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Incision and drainage of peroneal abscess
Trans-esophageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
28 year-old male previously healthy male with history of IVDU,
who initially presented with a peroneal abscess and concern for
peroneal necrotizing fasciitis, and multiple sepitc lung emboli.
The abscess was first noted as a small pimple 5 days prior to
presentation ([**10-19**]) and has progressively enlarged and become
more painful.  He had severals days of fevers and chills and
started experiencing pleuritic chest pain, worse with
inspiration. He also complained of cough prior to presentation.
The day he presented, he noted an area of induration and
erythema on left shin.
.
Patient underwent I&D of abscess on [**2112-10-24**]. An idurated,
purulent area in the scrotal raphe and an area on the left
buttock were opened.  Pustular sinus tracts with necrotizing
soft tissue wre found and debrided.  Following procedure,
patient was admitted to the SICU for close monitoring given
concern for SIRS/sepsis. Patient initially treated with
clindamycin, piperacillin-Tazobactam, gentamicin, and
vancomycin. Patient grew GPC in [**5-30**] bottles. Pt had CXR which
showed hypodensities, concerning for septic emboli. On CT chest
he was found to have numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules, all
concerning for septic embolic, infarcts, and disseminated
infection felt secondary to abscess.  TTE was negative for
vegatations.
.
ID was consulted and felt that the source of the bacteremia and
septic emboli was likely his scrotal abscess. The recommended
continuing broad spectrum antibiotics because of polymicrobial
nature of scrotal abscesses, including clindamycin to cover for
necrotizing fasciitis. The gentamycin was discontinued.
.
Overnight, on [**10-26**], oxygen saturation decreased to mid to high
80s on 4L NC.  Patient was noted to have increased work of
breathing.  He was transitioned to NRB and oxygen saturation
improved to low 90s, but patient continued to have increased
WOB.  He was transitioned to BIPAP mask and his breathing
symptoms improved.  Given worsening respiratory status and
persistent tachycardia, patient underwent CTA to assess for PE,
which showed no PE, but does show worsening right sided
non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion.
.
On transfer to the MICU, patient is comfortable and feels like
his breathing is more comfortable on BIPAP.  Scrotal pain is
well controlled with current regimen.  Patient reports having
fevers and chills overnight.
.

Studies:

[**10-24**] Skin Biopsy: DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Skin and soft tissue, scrotal raphe; debridement (A-C):

1.Cutaneous acute inflammation with abscess formation, tissue
necrosis, and surface bacterial organisms.
2.Special stains for microorganisms in process, to be reported
in an addendum.
2.  Skin, left buttock; debridement (D-E):
1.Cutaneous acute inflammation and abscess formation with tissue
necrosis.
2.Special stains for microorganisms in process, to be reported
in an addendum.

[**10-24**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. No previous
tracing available for
comparison.

[**10-24**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Ill-defined nodular opacities primarily
within the lung bases. Findings are concerning for infectious
process such as septic emboli, and a CT can be obtained for
further evaluation.

[**10-25**] transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is a mild
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).

[**10-26**] CTPA: IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism within the limitations of the study.
2. Numerous pulmonary nodules compatible with septic emboli.
Bilateral lower lobe peripheral heterogenous opacities are now
largely obscured by atelectasis are indeterminate but could also
be due to septic emboli with possible infarction.
3. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased from
the study
one day prior.
4. Regions of low attenuation within bilateral atelectasis,
concerning for
pneumonia.

[**10-26**] LLE U/S: IMPRESSION: Serpiginous-appearing hypoechoic
structure left anterior shin,
possibly representing a fluid collection or alternatively
superficial
thrombophlebitis of a markedly distended venous structure.
Clinical
correlation is recommended.

[**10-30**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Lung volumes remain low. There is more focal patchy nodular
opacity at
the left apex as well as in the right upper to mid lung which
appears somewhat cavitary and may reflect known septic emboli
which are now radiographically visible. More focal patchy
opacity at the right lung base is also present and could
represent a combination of compressive atelectasis, pneumonia
and/or evolving septic embolic areas. The more
