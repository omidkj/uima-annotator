History of Present Illness:
71 yo M with h/o HL, HTN, CAD with IMI s/p 4v CABG ('[**93**])
presenting s/p cath with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension,
low CI. Patient has long h/o CAD s/p IMI [**8-/2093**] with inferior
fixed defect on stress test and akinesis at cath, s/p 4v CABG
[**12/2093**] with LIMA-> LAD, SVG -> OM -> Diag and SVG-RCA.  He has
been off cardiovascular meds for > 5 years and has been lost to
CV follow-up.  2 months ago, the patient first caught a cold
with a sore throat, bad taste in back of throat,  and DOE.  No
fevers, chills, CP.  Since then he has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
symptoms, and over the last 2-4 weeks, the patient was noticed
to have decreased exercise tolerance due to increased DOE.  No
sypmtoms at rest or to bathroom, but SOB climbing 15 steps.
Also noted some increased abdominal distention, and wife noticed
[**Name2 (NI) **] edema.  Symptoms have progressed subacutely causing the
patient to present to the ED on [**4-2**] at [**Location (un) 620**] where BP was
increased to 182/90, he had an elevated d-dimer (1.96 -high) and
slightly elevated troponin x 3 (0.011-> 0.02 -> 0.016).  A CTA
was negative for PE.  He was diuresed with lasix 20 mg IV x 2
with improvement in SOB and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath to
evaluate for subendocardial NSTEMI.  At Cath, he was found to
have CO 4.06, CI 1.91, RA 28/28/21, RV 67/26, PA 67/38/49, PCW
38/41/33.  Coronary angiography demonstrated LM - mild tapering,
LAD proximal 90% then totally occluded, Lcx mid total occlusion
after OM1 with distal reconstitution via collaterals, RCA
proximal occlusion, and patent SVG-AM-RCA, Y-SVG-D1 and OM2,
LIMA-LAD.  He was transferred post-cath to the CCU for diuresis.

ROS: No nausea, vomiting, + irregular BMs, no black or bloody
stools, no weight loss, + decreased appetite at times, no night
sweats. No PND, orthopnea

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
CHF

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 8 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Graft Angiography: of 2 saphenous vein bypass grafts was
performed using
a 5 French right [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter, multi-purpose catheter, and
AL1
catheter with manual contrast injections.
Arterial Conduit Angiography:  of a left internal mammary artery
graft
was performed using a preformed [**Female First Name (un) 899**] catheter, with manual
contrast
injections.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant
system revealed severe 3 vessel native coronary disease. The
LMCA
had mild tapering. The LAD had a proximal 90% lesion and became
occluded
mid vessel. The LCX had a mid total occlusion after OM1 with
distal
reconstitution via vasa collaterals.  The RCA was proximally
occluded.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred given high filling
pressures.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed a severely elevated mean wedge
of
32mmHg. Cardiac index was low at 1.9 l/min/m2.
4. Graft angiography revealed a patent LIMA to LAD. The SVG to
AM to PDA
had mild plaquing. It supplied the distal right circulation
showing an
distally occluded RCA just cephalad to the origins of RPDA and
PRL.
There was an 80% lesion in the grafted AM with distal abrupt
tapering
into a smaller caliber distal vessel. The Y SVG graft to D1 and
OM2
contained mild luminal irregularities in the SVG to OM portion
with
retrograde perfusion into the distal AV groove CX and into the
mid AV
groove CV with vasa slow collateral filling of a higher OM.
There was
diffuse mild plaquing in the SVG to D1.
5. At the end of the case, the venous sheath was sewn in place
and the
pulmonary artery catheter left in place for monitored CHF
therapy in the
CCU.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Patent SVG and LIMA grafts.
4. Severely elevated PCPW.
