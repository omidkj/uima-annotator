History of Present Illness:
this is a 58 year old female with desquamative interstitial

hypothyroidism, and hypertension who presented with three days
of increasing dyspnea. The patient was seen by her primary care
physician in late [**Month (only) 359**] for chest congestion, persistent
cough, increased wheezing, and shortness of breath. No imaging
was performed at that time and she was started on doxycycline
with mild improvement in her symptoms over a period of two
weeks. Three days prior to presentation, she had acute worsening
of her symptoms with wheezing, cough, white sputum production
and shortness of breath; no hemoptysis. She has had subjective
chills but no fevers. No rhinorrhea or nasal congestion. No sore
throat. No chest pain or palpitations. Her shortness of breath
was worse with exertion but she denied orthopnea or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. She denied lower extremity edema. No nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, conistipation, dysuria,
hematuria, leg pain. She has had decreased PO intake over the
few days PTA. She had been using her inhalers continuously at
home without improvement. She had a CXR performed by her PCP on
the day of presentation which showed bilateral infiltrates. She
was referred to the emergency room.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99.6 P: 82 BP: 117/55 R: 28 O2
sat 92% on RA. CXR showed bilateral infiltrates. She received
magnesium 2 gram IV x 1, ceftriaxone 1 gram IV x 1 and
azithromycin 500 mg IV x 1. She also received continuous
nebulizers, solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1 and was placed on BIPAP for
increased work of breathing. Labs were notable for new
hyponatremia of 126, mild thrombocytopenia, WBC count of 7.6,
d-dimer 537.  She was initially transferred to the MICU for
management.
.
In the MICU, she was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin
for possible community acquired pneumonia. She later received
vancomycin as well (total 7 day course of each planned). She
received steroids 60mg Prednisone and was started on BiPAP for
increased work of breathing. A nasopharyngeal swab was done and
found to be positive for H1N1 influenza.  Per ID recommendations
she continues on vancomycin, azithromycin, Tamiflu (5 day
course), and ceftriaxone.
.
On the floor she says her shortness of breath is improved. She
denies fevers, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, but she does endorse some
palpitations when she exerts herself. Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Last BM was normal two
days ago (at BL she stools every 3-4 days). No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias. She denies recent travel before the onset of her
symptoms, but did state that she was in the hospital waiting to
have physical therapy for her right shoulder, and she said that
there were several people who appeared sick and to be coughing
in the waiting room with her. One day later, she began
developing cough and feeling ill. She had one day of non-bloody,
non-bilious diarrhea on the day that she presented to the
hospital, but this has since resolved. She continues to have a
cough productive of clear sputum.
