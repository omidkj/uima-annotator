Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
LLQ abdominal pain, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-2-13**]: Percutaneous G-J Tube replacement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 70M who is well-known to the West 2 surgical
service. He has a complex medical history of gallstone
pancreatitits, with necrotizing pancreatitis and abdominal
compartment syndrome requiring decompressive laparotomy. At the
subsequent reattempt at abdominal closure, the patient again
developed abdominal compartment syndrome. His course was
significant for respiratory and renal failure ultimately
requiring tracheostomy/PEG tube placement. He also had
infectious complications from his [**Hospital 9914**] hospital course. He
recovered well from this initial insult. The patient required
three laparoscopic necrosectomies. However, the patient
developed a pancreatico-[**Last Name (un) **]-cutaneous fistula that has healed
well in the interim. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and
dishcarged in [**Month (only) 1096**]. Since then, he has been at rehab where
he has been tolerating Passy-Muir valve and walking with
assistance. Two days ago, he began to develop left lower
quadrant abdominal pain with 2 episodes of diarrhea 2 days ago
and 5 episodes yesterday. He was told that he had a diagnosis of
C difficile colitis at the rehabilitation facility, which was
later confirmed. He is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care
given increasing LLQ tenderness and pain.

IMAGING:
[**2114-2-11**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST:
1. Wall thickening of the rectum, sigmoid, descending and
transverse colon with surrounding fat stranding compatible with
colitis. The etiology are most likely infectious or inflammatory
in nature. C. diff. colitis may explain these findings. ISchemic
etiology is felt less likely, although not entirely excluded.
2. Slightly smaller fluid and air collection in the mid
pancreas, extending inferiorly, compared to prior study from
[**2113-10-23**]. Clinical correlation for possible acute
process is recommended.
3. Right lower lobe consolidation with heterogeneous enhancement
and calcification and soft tissue in a lower lobe bronchus may
represent post-obstructive pneumonia. While this can be
secondary to mucous secretions, given that it persists since
prior exams, underlying endobronchial lesion can not be
excluded. Suggest pulmonary consultation for possible
bronchoscopy.
4. Multiple liver hypodensities are grossly stable.
5. Severe coronary artery calcifications.
.
[**2114-2-11**] AP CXR:
Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Right
basilar opacity persists which may represent consolidation,
partial right lower lobe collapse and/or effusion. Chest CT is
pending. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be
due to a trace effusion versus pleural thickening, without
significant interval change. Tracheostomy tube is again seen.
There is no significant interval change in the mediastinal or
cardiac silhouettes. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
.
[**2114-2-13**] CXR: Stable chest findings, no new pulmonary
abnormalities since the next preceding study.
