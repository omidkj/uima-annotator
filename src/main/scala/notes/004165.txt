HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for evaluation of
lower gastrointestinal bleed, however, was noted to have a
stool with bright red blood clots and was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit the day after admission on the
[**4-18**].

Gastrointestinal:  Once the patient was transferred for
evaluation to the Medical Intensive Care Unit he was given a
bowel prep of Go-Lytely and sent for colonoscopy.  On
colonoscopy it was found that the patient had diverticulosis
of the hepatic flexure, transverse colon and descending colon
and sigmoid colon.  Otherwise the colonoscopy was normal to
the cecum.  On the following day the patient had an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy which only showed duodenitis and
no other source for bleeding.  The patient did not have any
further episodes of diarrhea or bright red blood per rectum
or melena throughout his course in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and once his hematocrit was stabilized with transfusions
continued to do very well from gastrointestinal standpoint.
The patient was started on Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day on
hospitalization to protect against further irritation of his
stomach lining.  This dose was increased to 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
during the hospital stay and was sent home with a
prescription for Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Hematology:  The patient was transfused a total of eight
units of packed red blood cells during his stay in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  His hematocrit responded
initially inadequately to the transfusions, however, then
responded adequately and was stable for 48 hours after his
transfusions in the range of 33 to 37.  The patient's
coagulations were normal and his hematocrit was stable on
discharge.

Cardiology:  The patient has a history of coronary artery
disease, status post PTCA times [**2121**].  He had no episodes of
chest pain during his hospital course.  His hypertensive
medication was held during his Medical Intensive Care Unit
stay.  On transfer to the floor he was restarted on his
regular dose of Cardura and Norvasc and Lopressor was
titrated back to his usual 58 mg b.i.d. dose.

Endocrine:  The patient has a history of hyperthyroidism and
was maintained on Levoxil 250 mg p.o. q. day dosing.

Pulmonary:  The patient had no evidence for congestive heart
failure after his transfusions.  His O2 saturations were
stable.

Renal:  The patient's creatinine was initially elevated on
admission at 1.8.  However, with hydration this dropped to a
baseline of 1.2.

Prophylaxis:  The patient had pneumoboots while in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit when he was not ambulating.
These were discontinued once he started ambulating.  He was
also maintained on Protonix as described above.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Lower gastrointestinal bleed, likely secondary to bleeding
diverticulosis.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good and improving.  Patient was
evaluated by Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate very
well before discharge.  He was also tolerating p.o. without
any nausea, vomiting or pain.  Physical Therapy determined
that the patient was functioning at a very high level and
could return home with his cane.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., Cardura 2
mg p.o. b.i.d., Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Lasix 50 mg
q. day, Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q. day, niacin 250 mg p.o. q. day,
