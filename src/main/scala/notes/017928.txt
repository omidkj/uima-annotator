SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  RESPIRATORY:  [**Known lastname **] remained orally intubated on maximum
ventilatory settings of high frequency oscillating ventilator
with a mean airway pressure of 12, delta-P of 22.  He
received three doses of Surfactin.  He extubated to CPAP on
day of life number nine and was re-intubated on day of life
number 15.  He remained orally intubated until day of life
number 63 and was extubated to CPAP.  He weaned to nasal
cannula on day of life number 71 and remained on nasal
cannula and weaned to low flow nasal cannula until he was
able to be weaned to room air on [**2191-5-9**], which was day
of life number 24.

Caffeine citrate was started on day of life number eight and
he received that until day of life number 83.  Caffeine was
discontinued on [**2191-3-7**], and his last apnea and
bradycardia was on [**2191-4-23**].  Diuretic therapy of
Diuril was started on day of life number 32 and he continues
on Diuril currently on 35 mg per kilogram per day p.o.  The
plan is to wean the Diuril dose or to allow [**Known lastname **] to outgrow
the dose over the next two to three months. If Pulmonary
follow-up would be useful, Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**], [**Hospital3 1810**]
Pulmonology is available to see patients such as [**Known lastname **].

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  [**Known lastname **] received one course of
Indomethacin on [**1-6**] and [**1-7**], for presumed
patent ductus arteriosus.  He has not received an
echocardiogram this hospitalization.  [**Known lastname **] required
Dopamine for hypotension from day of life zero to day of life
two with a maximum dose of 15 micrograms per kilogram per
minute.  Otherwise, he has remained hemodynamically stable
this hospitalization; no murmur, with mean blood pressures 50
to 60 and heart rate 120 to 160.

3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  [**Known lastname **] was initially
nothing by mouth and received parenteral nutrition through a
central venous catheter with total fluids of 150 to 160 cc.
per kilogram per day.  He was started on trophic feedings of
10 cc. per kilogram per day on day of life eight and advanced
to full volume feedings by day of life number 17.  He
advanced to maximum caloric density of 32 calories per ounce
with ProMod by day of life number 29.  He is currently on
Enfamil 28 calories per ounce with four calories per ounce of
concentration and four calories per ounce of corn oil,
receiving a minimum of 120 cc. per kilogram per day [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Known lastname **] tolerated this feeding advancement and caloric density
advancement without difficulty. During the terminal portion of
his hospitalization, [**Known lastname **] had some difficulty maintaining
adequate po intake. This lead to discussions with his mother
and father about the possible need for [**Name (NI) 9945**] placement. Over
the week prior to discharge however, [**Known lastname **] has markedly
improved his intake and is making his minimum volumes. He will
need close attention to his growth velocity and nutritional
intake.

He was also started on sodium chloride and potassium chloride
supplements on day of life number 23.  Sodium chloride was
discontinued on day of life number 63.  He continues on
potassium chloride supplements of 3 mEq per kilogram per day.
The most recent electrolytes on [**5-25**] were sodium of 137,
potassium 4.1, chloride 100, bicarbonate of 26, BUN of 9,
creatinine of 0.1.

The most recent weight is 4.095 kilograms, head circumference
37 centimeters, length 53 centimeters.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  [**Known lastname **] received phototherapy from day
of life one to day of life 17.  Maximum bilirubin level of
6.0/0.4.  The most recent bilirubin level on day of life
number 29 was a total bilirubin of 1.5 with a direct of 0.4.
[**Known lastname **] was started on Reglan and Zantac on [**2191-4-29**],
for gastroesophageal reflux.

Due to increased vomiting, an upper gastrointestinal was
performed on [**5-10**], which revealed no obstruction and mild
gastroesophageal reflux.  At that time, the medications were
changed to Reglan and Prilosec, and he continues on those
medications currently.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  Blood type A positive.  [**Known lastname **] received nine
packed red blood cell transfusions this hospitalization.  The
most recent hematocrit on [**5-17**] was 30.2%, reticulocyte
count of 7%.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  [**Known lastname **] was initially started on
Ampicillin and gentamicin which was changed to Ampicillin and
cefotaxime for positive Klebsiella pneumoniae in his
cerebrospinal fluid culture on [**2191-1-13**].  [**Known lastname **]
received a total of 21 days of Ampicillin and Cefotaxime.
Blood cultures were negative at that time.

[**Known lastname **] received a ten day course of Gentamicin and
Ceftazidime for positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa from an
endotracheal sputum culture.  He received that ten day course
of antibiotics from day of life 55 to day of life 64.  Blood
cultures were negative at that time.

7.  NEUROLOGY:  Head ultrasound on day of life two revealed
no interventricular hemorrhage, although head ultrasound on
day of life six revealed bilateral interventricular
hemorrhage with ventriculomegaly.  Neurology from the
[**Hospital3 1810**] was consulted and it was recommended that
[**Known lastname **] receive daily therapeutic lumbar punctures from
[**2191-1-20**] until [**2191-2-7**].  Head ultrasound on
day of life number eight also revealed ventriculomegaly with
a clot in the cisterna magna.

Serial head ultrasounds after the therapeutic lumbar
punctures revealed decrease in ventriculomegaly.  The most
recent head ultrasound on [**2191-4-28**], showed stable
ventriculomegaly with ventricles measuring 6 millimeters and
6.7 millimeter ventricular horns bilaterally.

[**Known lastname **] is to receive follow-up with Neurology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
approximately six weeks after discharge and he will receive
follow-up at the Neonatal Neurology Program at the [**Hospital3 18242**].

8.  HEARING:  Hearing screening was performed with automatic
auditory brain stem r
