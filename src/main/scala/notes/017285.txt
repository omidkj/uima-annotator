[**2168-12-6**] - Carotid Duplex
Bilateral calcific plaque, no appreciable associated ICA or CCA
stenosis, however.

[**2168-12-7**] - ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The effective
regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is being A paced and is on an infusion of
phenylephrine and epinephrine
1. A bioprosthesis is well seated in the Mitral position. No MR
is seen. Mean gradient of about 4 mm of Hg is noted.
2. LV systolic function is unchanged. RV function is preserved.

3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. Other findings are unchanged.

[**2168-12-11**] - CXR
Interval improvement in right lung infiltrate and left lower
lobe volume loss. Small bilateral pleural effusions. The left
pleural effusion may have increased in size in the interval.


Brief Hospital Course:
Presented to OSH ruling in for myocardial infarction and
underwent catheterization.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical evaluation.  He underwent preoperative workup that
revealed an infected tooth and was started on antibiotics, all
other workup was normal.  On [**2168-12-7**] he was transported to the
operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft
surgery and mitral valve replacement with out complications,
please see operative report for further details.  He was
transported to the cardiac surgery recovery unit requiring
vasopressors, propofol, and insulin.  Over the first 24 hours he
went into junctional rhythm that was treated with atrial pacing,
and returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm.  Vasoactive medications
were titrated for hemodynamics.  He was awoke and was extubated.
 He continued to progress on POD 1 but continued on vasoactive
medications.  Then POD 3 he continued to improve and was
transferred to the floor.  He went into atrial fibrillation was
treated with beta blockers, amiodarone and anticoagulation. He
converted back to sinus rhythm on POD 6.  He was followed in
consultation by [**Last Name (un) **] for his preop diagnosis of DM and
elevated HgA1C, they recommended lowering his daily NPH to 45
units. He worked with physical therapy and his continues to
increase activity level.  On POD #8 he again returned to atrial
fibrillation, rate controlled. Physical therapy continued to
work with him daily. Mr. [**Known lastname 4886**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day nine. He
will be followed by Dr.[**Name (NI) 71276**] coumadin clinic for coumadin
dosing with his first blood draw over the weekend by the
visiting nurse. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29378**] within the

Lastly, he will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] in 1 month and his
cardiologist within the next two weeks.
