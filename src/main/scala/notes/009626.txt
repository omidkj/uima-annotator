CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-5-1**] 5:20 PM

FINDINGS: Periventricular white matter hypodensities are
identified consistent with small vessel ischemic changes. There
is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, although filling of the
arteries and veins with intravenous contrast limits sensitivity
for subtle subarachnoid hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are
unremarkable. There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of acute fracture. Visualized paranasal
sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage. Small vessel
ischemic changes.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-5-1**] 5:21 PM

FINDINGS: There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The
vertebral alignment is preserved. Degenerative changes are
identified, specifically at C5-C6 with joint space narrowing and
posterior osteophyte formation. There is no evidence of acute
fracture or dislocation. Visualized lung apices are clear.
Incidental note is made of a large thyroid goiter which extends
into the superior mediastinum.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture. Degenerative changes
primarily at C5-C6. Large thyroid goiter.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT  [**2122-5-4**] 8:18 AM

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Extracranial evaluation of bilateral
carotids was performed with B-mode, color, and spectral Doppler
ultrasound modes.

On the right peak systolic velocities are 109, 76 and 87 cm/s in
the internal, common and external carotid arteries respectively.
The right ICA to CCA ratio is 1.44.

On the left, peak systolic velocities are 70, 70 and 136 cm/s in
the internal, common and external carotid arteries respectively.
The left ICA to CCA ratio is 1.0.

Both brachial arteries presented antegrade flow.

COMPARISON: None available.

IMPRESSION: There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal
carotid arteries bilaterally.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  [**2122-5-7**] 10:28 AM

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
examinations of the left internal jugular, axillary, brachial,
basilic, and cephalic veins were performed and demonstrate
normal compressibility, augmentability, and respiratory
variation in flow. No intraluminal thrombus was identified.
There is a moderate amount of subcutanous edema in the left
forearm in the region of the patient's redness, possibly
cellulitis.

IMPRESSION: No left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. Left
forearm edema, which may be related to cellulitis.

[**2122-5-2**] 12:32 am MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2122-5-4**]**

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2122-5-4**]):    No MRSA isolated.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. Orthopedics was
consulted given her fractures. She was taken to the operating
room on [**5-3**] where she underwent ORIF repair of right bimalleolar
ankle fracture on [**2122-5-3**]. She will require follow up in the next
1-2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for the left Lis Franc fracture. For
now she is non weight bearing on both lower extremities.

On [**2122-5-4**] developed some confusion, disorientation, agitation
and hallucinations
following dosage of pain med (Dilaudid and Percocet)--patient
and
family report she was seeing bugs in the room.  Treated with one
dose Haldol 1 mg with improvement. Geriatric Medicine was
consulted and made several recommendations pertaining to her
medications.

On [**5-6**] she underwent placement of an IVC filter given that she
is at high risk for developing pulmonary thrombus because of her
fractures and limited mobility. She is also still maintained on
Heparin SQ tid.

During her ICU stay she was noted to have herpetic lesions on
her posterior chest at around T6-7 region. Acyclovir therapy was
initiated promptly; she is due to complete the course on
[**2122-5-13**].

She was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and has
been recommended for rehab after her acute hospital stay. The
screening process was initiated and she was discharged on HD
#11.
