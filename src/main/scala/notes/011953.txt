Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH w/overwhelming sepsis, MRSA bacteremia with
multiorgan failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 62yo male w/hx of CAD s/p MI (EF50%), COPD, OSA, Chronic
Myelosuppresion, and CVA who was admitted to [**Hospital3 26615**]
Hospital on [**2151-3-9**] for SOB. He was thought to be having a COPD
exacerbation and was initially treated w/solumedrol and
erythromyocin. The timing of subsequent events is not completely
clear from the medical records that were provided, but he did
have the following pertinent events documented:
-AFlutter w/LBBB s/p cardioversion
-CT Neck w/contrast on [**3-22**] showing no mass or fluid collection
-CT Head on [**3-22**] showing low attenuation area in Left parietal
white matter consitent with infarction, as well as right
maxillary sinus fluid collection.
-Chest CT w/o contrast on [**3-22**] showing consolidation/collapse of
RLL and LLL consolidation. Right pleural effusion, and a
questionable blockage of the bronchus intermedius due to a mucus
plug.
-MIBI on [**3-18**] very small anteroseptal defect at apex w/mild
decrease in systolic function.
-LENI Left and Right leg on [**3-11**] showing no DVT.
-TEE showed no [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]. No AS/AR. Trival MR. Elevated right
sided pressures.
Over the course of his stay he continued to deteriorate and
developed worsening renal failure and CHF. It seems that he was
intubated at 4/4 and that dialysis was initiated on [**3-24**] through
a temporary right femoral line. His hypoxia continued to worsen
on the ventillator despite increasing FiO2's and pressures. At
this time he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
managment.


Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI [**2140**], Nonobstructive CAD on cath [**4-21**] w/EF 50%

[**2151-3-25**] CXR: FINDINGS: This is a technically limited study due
to portable technique. There is an endotracheal tube present
with the tip probably terminating satisfactorily in the trachea
at the level of the thoracic inlet. A NG tube is present,
probably in the esophagus with the tip not well seen. There is
also a left internal jugular catheter with the tip probably in
the SVC. There is evidence for failure with cardiomegaly, upper
zone redistribution, and prominence of the central vascularity.
There are bilateral pleural effusions. There is retrocardiac
atelectasis or consolidation and patchy bibasilar opacities.

[**2151-3-26**]: ECHO Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function cannot be reliably assessed. 2. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The valves are not well seen, but there is no obvious
vegetation seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**2151-3-25**]: Transferred from OSH in overwhelming sepsis. Redosed
vanco. Added ceftaz for pseudomonal coverage. Pressors changed
to Levophed. Transfuse for goal Hct>30. Re-site central venous
access from IJ. Scheduled HD, made renal aware. Started insulin
gtt for tighter glycemic control. Consulted plastics for eval of
decub ulcer. Serial Hcts secondary to coffee ground from OG tube
suction. Vitamin K given for elevated INR and hx of liver dz.
Supplement w/steroids for septic shock. Maxamized ventilatory
support w/increased PEEP given morbid obesity.
[**2151-3-26**]: Renal planning for CVVHDF. Lactate continuing to trend
higher, now 6.5, despite resuc efforts. WBC trending from 10.5
to 23.8. Adding gent given these lab findings while on Vanco.
Esophageal balloon study to set PEEP. ? of PFO causing continued
hypoxia on ABGs.
[**2151-3-27**]: Episode of rapid Afibb w/LBBB, bolused w/amiodarone and
started gtt. Unsucessfull balloon study. Right subclavian
placed. Sacral decub ulcer growing GPC. CXR w/evid of resolving
failure. TTE w/o evidence of vegitations. Lactate now 19.1.
Noted to have multiple ischemic/cool digits on right foot while
on pressors. Vascular consulted and recs implimented w/heparin
gtt. Family meeting w/directions for team to make patient
CMO/patient's wishes per family not to be ventilated more than a
few days. Patient declared dead at 4:15pm by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
