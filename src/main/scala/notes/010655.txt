Chief Complaint:
Right abdominal and groin pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2108-12-31**]: EVAR of right CIA aneurysm, fem-fem bypass


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10717**] is an 88 year old gentleman with a history of CAD s/p
CABG, HTN, AAA s/p open repair ~5 years ago and a known R CIA
aneurysm, s/p attempted endovascular repair at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital
last Thursday ([**2108-12-27**]). Per his daughter-in-law, the repair was
unsuccessful due to difficulties with access and was deferred
for a later date with planned brachial access. The patient was
discharged home and was doing well until this morning, when he
suddenly began complaining of severe abdominal and groin pain.
He was apparently ashen, diaphoretic, and unable to get out of
bed and was therefore taken emergently to [**Hospital3 **] by
ambulance. A CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast was done which
showed a 6cm R CIA aneurysm with active extravasation of
contrast into
the retroperitoneum. He was therefore transferred emergently to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.


Past Medical History:
PMH: CAD s/p CABG (last stress test at OSH a few weeks ago as
preop preparation for embolization procedure, reportedly passed
per his daughter-in-law), AAA s/p open repair, HTN, HPL, AFib,
COPD, DMII, BPH, mild dementia

PSH: CABG, open AAA (~5 years ago at [**Hospital1 3278**]), attempted coil
embolization of R CIA, pacemaker placement, b/l inguinal hernia
repairs

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service after
surgical repair of his aneurysm.

Neuro: The patient was initially kept intubated and sedated. On
POD0 his sedation was weaned and was awake and following
commands. His pain was managed with IV medications with good
effect and then transitioned to oral pain medications while
tolerating a diet. He remained confused at baseline due to
underlying dementia.

CV:  The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. He initially required a
nitroglycerin drip for hypertension. This was weaned off and was
placed on a labetolol/hydralazine regimen for adequate control.
An ECHO was obtained in the ICU and it demonstrated mild LVH
with EF 50-55%, moderate to severe TR, and pumonary artery
hypertension. Serial cardiac enzymes were checked and
demonstrated mild demand ischemia with peak troponin of 0.15. He
was placed on his home lasix regimen. He was started on
Metoprolol TID and this was titrated up to 75mg TID at the time
of discharge. His diovan was increased to 240mg daily at the
time of discharge. These will be titrated up to his home doses
as tolerated.

Pulmonary:  The patient was extubated on POD 0 without
difficulty. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and
incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout this
hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN:

Post operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF.

The patient's diet was advanced to regular POD2, which was
tolerated well.

The patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IVF
were adjusted when necessary.  The patient's electrolytes were
routinely followed during this hospitalization, and repleted
when necessary. He remains edematous in the bilateral lower
extremities and along the groin crease with extension to the
back. He was diuresed as tolerated, with 1 episode of low blood
pressure secondary to over-diuresis requing a small fluid bolus.
He will continue diuresis as tolerated.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. He spiked a temperature
to 101.3 POD 0 and urine and blood cultures were obtained which
were negative. On POD 5 he was noted to have increasing erythema
over the groin incision and due to concern for wound infection
was placed on Ancef. There was no change in the erythema
overnight and the antibiotics were changed over to Vancomycin.
Ultrasound of the groins revealed bilateral simple fluid
collections approximately 3.2x2.3cm, likely seroma. Fluid of the
drainage was cultured and was negative on gram stain, culture
was pending. On [**1-8**] he spiked a temperature to 101.4. UA and
chest xray was negative, and fever was due to wound infection.
ID was consulted and Zosyn was added per recommendations. The
erythema improved. He will be discharged with one week of IV
antibiotics.

Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
this stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly and then was
placed on his home glipizide regimen with adequate control.

Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely. He required a total of 6 units of blood between the
intra-op and early post-operative periods in addition to 1 unit
of platelets and 1 unit of FFP. His hematocrit remained stable
thereafter and did not require further transfusions.

Prophylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
aspirin during this stay in addition to pneumoboots.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, voiding, and pain was controlled. He was discharge to
acute rehabilitation center where his PCP will be resuming his
care and coordinating further management. The family was in
agreement with this plan.
