Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2159-8-13**] Two vessel coronary artery bypass grafting utlizing the
left internal mammary to left anterior descending with vein
graft from left internal mammary to obtuse marginal.
[**2159-8-10**] Cardiac catheterization with placement of IABP

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 year old Portuguese speaking man with history of
hypertension and hyperlipidemia was admitted for an elective
catheterization after an increase in DOE and increasing CP with
walking.  At present he is able to walk only 2 blocks before he
becomes short of breath.

He was previously quite active and athletic until two years ago
when he began to have significant dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue. He has a long standing history of tobacco and alcohol
abuse. In [**2158-6-27**] while having a doctor's appointment, he
was found to be extremely hypertensive and was admitted to
[**Hospital3 2737**]. Testing at that time included a Cardiolite ETT
where he exercised 5 minutes 31 seconds on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol, 87%
max PHR, stopping due to leg pain. EKG was non diagnostic due to
baseline ST abnormalities. He had no chest pain. Imaging did not
reveal any definite evidence of inducible ischemia. EF was noted
at 22%. Echo on [**2158-7-25**] revealed a dilated LV with an EF of 25%
with severe global hypokinesis.

Last month the patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 **] in
[**Location (un) 5503**] for a syncopal event. This was witnessed by a family
member. He apparently had lost consciousness for several
minutes. He was ruled out for an MI and told that this was most
likely due to dehydration as it was a very hot day. Per Dr. [**Name (NI) 63433**] notes, an echo suggested a regional wall motion
abnormality and persantine ETT suggested some anterior apical
infarct with some
inferoposterior ischemia. Cardiac catheterization was
recommended but the patient refused. His family has since been
able to convince him to have angiography. His daughter reports
that her father can look short of breath at
rest and with any type of walking. Previously he was quite
athletic and now he cannot even walk a of a mile. She states
that he easily becomes lightheaded when involved in light
exertion or on a hot day. She also reports that over the past
few months he has been getting chest discomfort with walking. He
does
not use SL nitroglycerin. She is unclear if he has a history of
orthopnea or PND. She reports that he does not have LE edema. He
does complain of leg
fatigue with minimal amounts of walking. She reports that he has
smoked 2 packs a day for over forty years and he has recently
cut back to a pack a day. She also states that he has been
drinking for at least forty years, currently
imbibing in several beers and several glasses of wine throughout
the day. He is also very non compliant with medications.

Social History:
Patient is widowed and currently lives with his mother. [**Name (NI) **] is
Portuguese speaking. He previously worked in a warehouse until
last year, stopping d/t his health. Daughter reports that he has
smoked 2 packs a day for over forty years and he has recently
cut back to a pack a day. She also states that he has been
drinking for at least forty years, currently imbibing in several
beers and several glasses of wine throughout the day. His
daughter [**Name (NI) **] helps out with his care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19688**] was admitted and underwent elective cardiac
catheterization which was signficant for severe three vessel
disease(including left main) and severely depressed left
ventricular function. Angiography demonstrated a co-dominant
system with an 80% distal left main lesion, a heavily calcified
LAD with 80% mid stenosis, an 80% lesion in the first obtuse
marginal and a proximal 60% lesion in the right coronary artery.
Ventriculogram revealed 1+ mitral regurgitatin and an LVEF of
25%. Based on his critical coronary anatomy, an IABP was placed
to augment diastolic filling. Of note, catheterization was
complicated by vasovagal episode which responded well to IV
fluids and Atropine. Cardiac surgery was subsequently consulted
and further evaluation was performed. An echocardiogram on [**8-11**] was notable for normal left ventricular cavity size. The
overall left ventricular systolic function was
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30%)
secondary to
severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall,
and apex. There was only mild(1+) mitral regurgitation. Workup
was otherwise unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery. He
remained pain free on medical therapy.

On [**8-13**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed two vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting. Operative findings were notable for a heavily
calcified aorta. A cross-clamp was not utilized. The heart was
therefore on bypass beating and the Guidant CTS off-pump system
was used to obtain exposure on a beating empty heart. His
operative course was otherwise uneventful and he transferred to
the CSRU for further invasive monitoring. Within 48 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He maintained
stable hemodynamics as he weaned from inotropic support. The
IABP was removed without complication. He experienced
intermittent fevers with negative workup - blood and urine
cultures remained negative. On postoperative day four, he
transferred to the SDU.

He went on to experience some confusion/agitation which
initially required Haldol. Narcotics were also withheld. His
symptoms progressed to visual hallucinations, diplopia, left
visual field cuts associated with mild left sided weakness and
facial droop. Neurology was urgently consulted and a head
MRI/MRA was obtained on [**8-20**]. Findings were suggestive of a
large subacute right occipital lobe infarct, within posterior
cerebral artery territory. No was no evidence of intracranial
bleed. Aspirin therapy was continued. Over the remainder of his
hospital stay, his neurologic/mental status gradually improved
and nearly returned to baseline. He worked daily and continued
to improve with physical and occupational therapies. At
discharge, his confusion had resolved and he had normal motor
function. Unfortunately, he continued to experience left visual
field cuts. He had no more diplopia.

Given his depressed LV function, he was maintained on an ACEI
and Coreg. He remained in a normal sinus rhythm without atrial
or ventricular dysrhythmias. He was concomitantly diuresed
toward his preoperative weight. He responded well to Lasix and
by discharge, was near his preoperative weight with oxygen
saturations of 98% on room air. His renal function remained
normal. Just prior to discharge, he was treated with a short
course of intravenous antibiotics for a superficial phlebitis.

He was eventually discharged to home on postoperative day 14. He
will be tranisitioned to PO antib
