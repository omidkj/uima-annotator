Mr. [**Known lastname 106893**] is a 79 yo RH man with a PMH of HTN, HLD and DM p/w

Today he woke up in his USOH. he had breakfast and had no

in his limbs, no numbness, no blurry vision or double vision.

His wife left home to run some errands at 9:00 am. He was at his
baseline. Later on he was changing his clothes and developed a
sudden onset vertiginous sensation: "everything was spinning".
However, when inquired, he explains he felt as if he were "on a
boat".  His whole body "vibrated" with each heartbeat". He did
not lean toward the RIGHT or the LEFT. He cannot recall if he
was
clumsy bottoning up. He felt nauseated and vomited once. He
describes the emesis episode as "a convulsion" and "dry heaves".
I clarified that he did not have any tremors or shakes. He had
no
headache.

His wife returned at 10:30 am and found him sitting in the edge
of the bed. He could not answer to her when she asked what was
wrong. He looked "ashen and clammy". There was no evident facial
droop or weakness. He was able to sit still in the edge of the
bed without swinging to the sides. He has never had this type of
an episode before.
