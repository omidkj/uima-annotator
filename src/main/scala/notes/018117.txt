Dialysis

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 7203**] is a 60 year old spanish speaking man with Diabetes,
hypertenion, hyperlipideamia, history of ESRD on HD (Tues,
Thurs, Sat), presenting with chest pain radiating to the left
arm. Patient reports his symptoms started yesterday, at rest
while sitting. He describes the pain as localized over the left
chest, dull pressure with radiation to the back mid scapular
area. No palpitations, diaphoresis or nausea. Patient took
nitroglycerin at home without improvement in symptoms.

Patient has been taking all medications as prescribed and has
not skipped any dialysis sessions. He does report difficulty
breathing starting with above symptoms.

EMS gave patient ASA, Atropine 1mg and Nitro Spray x 1.

In the ED, vital signs Temp 97.1 BP 150/36 RR 24  O2 Sat: 99% RA
Patient was found to be hyperkalemic, bradycardic (junctional
rhythm per report). Patient underwent CTA chest/abdomen and
pelvis without evidence of dissection or PE. Per ED report a
"small amount of contrast extravasated" on the right hand. Right
IJ line was attempted but not successful, left subclavian line
was placed. Patient did not receive any aspirin, plavix or
heparin. Renal, cardiology and EP teams were made consulted.
Patient was given Morphine, Atropine (0.5mg x 2), 10 units of IV
insulin with 1 amp of dextrose, Kayexalate and 2gm of calcium
Gluconate.

ECG: ([**7-17**] @2200)Bradycardic at 44, likely junctional escape
rhythm (narrow QRS, no P waves, regular without variation. Right
bundleoid pattern, deep Q waves on lead III and Deep S wave on
lead I, no T wave inversion on lead III. Peaked T waves with
lateral T-wave flattening
.
ECG: (on arrival) Regular rate, likely sinus bradycardia
although varying P wave morphology. Peaked T waves, prolonged
QTc (478), Unchanged inferior Q wave in III and TWI in I.

ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old man with complicated medical history, relevant for
diabetes, end stage renal disease on HD, PVD / CAD s/p CABG and
repeated stenting, presenting with chest pain, hyperkalemia,
bradycardia.

#. Chest Pain: Acute onset of pain at rest was very concerning
for unstable angina. Patient with TIMI risk score of 5 (Known
stenosis, greater than 3 CAD risk factors, Aspirin use,
recurring angina in 24 hrs and positive troponins). Nonetheless,
it is possible that this event constituted demand ischemia from
metabolic disturbance or new valvular disease (loud murmur)
leading to increase in demand. Degree of known CAD however
severely limits interventions as pt is s/p CABG and stenting.
Patient was closely monitored and dialysis started at the
bedside. With correction of hyperkalemia, heart rate improved
spontaneously and sinus rhythm was again noted. Chest pain
improved significantly and remaining pain was easily
reproducible to light palpation.
Echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate for new wall motion
abnormalities or new valvular disease. Results revealed
preserved global systolic function and no new valvular process.
With availabe information, it appears symptoms at presentation
were related to bradycardia and do not warrant further workup at
this time.  Patient no longer complaining of chest pain or
shortness of breath on walking at discharge.

#. Right Hand Contrast Infiltration: Per report this ocurred in
ED at time of CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis. Hand was very edematous,
tight and painful, concerning for compartment syndrome. Hand
surgery team was [**Month/Year (2) 653**] and hand was elevated and splinted.
Patient will need follow up with hand surgery clinic.

#. Hyperkalemia: Unclear etiology, as pt has been complient with
dietary restrictions and has not missed dialysis sessions. This
quickly resolved with adequate dialysis, raising concerns for
sub-optimal dialysis as an outpatient.
Per renal team, no evidence of fistula disfunction at this time.
Patient to resume dialysis per outpatient regimen.

#. Bradycardia / Junctional escape rythm: Although well
documented in medical record to correspond to hyperkalemia, we
considered beta blocker toxicity in differential. After
dialysis, rhythm spontaneouly returned to sinus and no more
bradycardia was observed. There is no evidence of beta blocker
toxicity.

#. ESRD: Received dialysis, resume outpatient schedule of tues,
Thurs, Sat.
