HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year old
male referred from [**Hospital1 **]-Gluver from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for
elective catheterization.  The patient was recently
hospitalized at NWH for initial complaints of
gastrointestinal distress and vomiting in early [**2153-3-2**].  The patient ultimately had pulmonary edema and
required intubation for hypoxia.  The patient subsequently
was ruled-in for myocardial infarction with troponin of 2.5.
The patient was treated with blood thinners, beta blocker,
nitroglycerin and Lasix and had an Adenosine stress test
which was reportedly revealing of an inferior, posterior wall
apex akinesis.  Cardiac catheterization was recommended and
the patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1129**]
for catheterization but refused.  The patient was discharged
from rehabilitation two days ago and complained of three
episodes today of substernal chest pain lasting about five
minutes each radiating to bilateral arms resolving with
sublingual nitroglycerin.  The patient states this is similar
to his anginal episode with his myocardial infarction.  The
patient presented to NWH Emergency Department and was given
Lovenox, Aspirin, Plavix, Lopressor and Nitropaste.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for catheterization by patient request.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction in the remote past, myocardial
infarction two weeks ago; diabetes Type 2; legally blind from
macular degeneration; PNA; benign prostatic hypertrophy;
peripheral vascular disease; congestive heart failure with an
ejection fraction of 55% in [**2153-3-2**].

ALLERGIES:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; Plavix; nitroglycerin,
both Plavix and nitroglycerin one time at the outside
hospital; Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Ativan; Glyburide 2.5
mg p.o. q.d.; Zocor 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.d.; Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix
40 mg p.o. q.d.; Flomax 0.8 mg p.o. q.d.

revealed 98.4, 64, 168/83, 16, and 98% on 2 liters.  In
general he is an elderly white male in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, moist mucous membranes,
extraocular movements intact.  Pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen,
guaiac negative.  Obese, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities, no clubbing, edema or cyanosis, alert and

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.4, hematocrit 37.9, platelets
214.  Chem-7 142, 3.8, 103, 30, 16, 0.8 and 145.  PT/PTT 12.9
and 32.3.  Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 60, right
bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2153-3-23**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service.  Cardiac catheterization on
[**2153-3-3**] demonstrated severe three vessel disease.
Given the problems with congestive heart failure and unstable
angina a multivessel coronary artery bypass graft was
indicated.  The patient was preopped for the Operating Room
and on [**2153-3-26**], the patient was taken for a three
vessel coronary artery bypass graft, left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal 1 and saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery were used.  Immediately postoperatively the
patient was sent to the Intensive Care Unit where he did
well.  The patient's chest tubes were removed on
postoperative day #1.  The patient was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day #1.  On postoperative day #1 the
patient also had an episode of atrial fibrillation and was
given Lopressor by night coverage.  The patient remained in
atrial fibrillation for the remained of his hospital stay and
was rate controlled.  On postoperative day #2 the patient was
seen by physical therapy and was out of bed ambulating.  Also
on postoperative day #2 the patient's Foley catheter was
removed.  On postoperative day #3 the patient remained in
atrial fibrillation and was started on an Amiodarone bolus
with no response.  The patient was given 5 mg of Coumadin on
postoperative day #3 for anticoagulation.  On postoperative
day #4 the patient's wires were removed.  The patient was
screened for rehabilitation on postoperative day #4.  Also on
postoperative day #4, the patient was given another 5 mg of
Coumadin for an INR of 1.3.  The patient's goal INR is 2 to
2.5.  The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation on
[**2153-3-31**] for further work towards his goals.  The
patient is discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.

artery bypass graft.
