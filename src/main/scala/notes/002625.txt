Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o male admitted following partial transplant nephrectomy
for mass in transplant kidney found on routine screening. Due to
the complex nature of this case, patient went to the OR with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] from urology and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 816**] with Transplant. It was stated
that due to the complex nature of this case, two attendings were
present for the case involving Open partial nephrectomy from the
transplanted kidney.
In summary, the transplanted kidney was completely encased in a
large amount of scar
tissue making dissection difficult. The tumor was excised, and
JP drain was placed. Please see the surgical notes of both Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 816**] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] for details.
In the post op period, his pain was controlled using a PCA.
Urine output and residual renal function were excellent.
Pathology of the tumor revealed  "Oncocytoma, margin free of
tumor"
On about POD 6, the patient was noted to be increasingly
distended. Bowel function was very sluggish post op, in addition
to a notation on labs of increased WBC as well as development of
fever. A CT of the abdomen was obtained showing "Moderate grade
partial small bowel obstruction with transition point noted
within the right lower quadrant, slightly anterior to the
transplant kidney."
He was taken back to the OR on [**2101-5-24**] again with Drs' [**Name5 (PTitle) 816**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 3748**] for Exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions and
freeing up obstruction. Per the operative report lysis of
adhesions of the bowel was done and the finding that the
terminal ileum had been plastered down to the area of the
kidney. This was felt to be the transition point seen on CT and
this was the cause of the obstruction. No bowel perforation was
found or other evidence of intra-abdominal pathology seen. There
was a significant amount of fluid encountered when the patient
was opened. This fluid was sent for culture and lab tests.
Creatinine was low, so it was not felt to be a urine leak.
Enterococcus (Vanco sensitive) did grow from the fluid as well
as from blood cultures obtained the same day. Urine cultures
from the day previous were also positive for Enterococcus and he
was started on Vancomycin and Flagyl which were given x 7 days.
An ID consult was obtained.
He was switched to Ampicillin on [**2101-5-27**] and this was continued
for 9 days. In addition he received Levaquin for a total of 11
days.
The patient was started on TPN via a PICC line, this was
continued for about two weeks. PO diet was started back slowly,
he will be seen as an outpatient by nutrition. PICC line was
d/c'd prior to his discharge.
The patient started with increased stooling, and C diff A&B was
sent. The cultures were negative x 5, however he was started on
PO Vanco as his WBC remained elevated, and no other source was
identified. A CMV viral load was sent which was positive at 909
copies, he was started on a 3 week course of Valcyte. He also
has a positive HSV screen from a lesion on his lip. The Valcyte
will cover both. In addition, he had a stool for CMV sent, which
was negative up to this time, but had not yet been finalized.
Approximately 2 weeks into the hospitalization, the patient
developed new onset AFib.  He was chemically converted on
Amiodarone and was started on a heparin drip. Due to the
interaction between amiodarone, Prograf and Coumadin, the
patient was started on half dose Coumadin on [**6-3**]. Over the next
2 days, his Hct was noted to fall from 27% to 17%. The
anticoagulation was stopped and he received 3 units of pRBC's.
Of note, his stool at this time was noted to be dark and guaiac
positive. The heparin drip and coumadin were placed on hold. The
amiodarone was discontinued and it was decided to rate control
the patient which was well achieved with beta blockade. The
coumadin was restarted at an even lower dose, as well, the
heparin remained off and he was started on Lovenox injection,
which he will be continuing at home short term.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] performed a cystoscopy on [**6-7**] due to concern for
fluid from the JP drain from initial surgery was found to have a
creatinine of 22.9. He underwent cystoscopy, a 4.8 French x 10
cm double-J stent was placed with the proximal coil in the
collecting system and distal coil in the bladder. A Foley drain
was left in place which should be left in place for two weeks.
Patient to be seen in followup clinic with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**]. A JP drain
is also in place, removal will be following Foley removal by
several days and will be determined by urology.
Patient was given a glucometer and will check blood sugars at
home. Given signs and symptoms of low blood sugar and started on
Glipizide [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations.
Scripts were given to the patient for new medications which will
be filled at patients home transplant center [**Hospital 86**] Med Center
at their free pharmacy as this has been his usual source for his
medications.
Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (pager [**Telephone/Fax (1) 78181**], fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77542**], his PCP
will be monitoring PT/INR and was contact[**Name (NI) **] on [**6-14**] to verify
this. VNA will draw and fax results of first two INRs and then
they will be arranged as an outpatient.
