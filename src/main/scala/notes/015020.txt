Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Augmentin / Penicillins / Moxifloxacin

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, LE edema, leg redness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
86M with history of HTN, DM, CAD, SVT, pAib, PVD, CKD, and
recent hospitalization in the ICU from [**Date range (2) 19889**] requiring
pressors/intubation presents from home with worsening symptoms
of CHF and concern for cellulitis of L LE. History is gathered
from the patient and his 2 daughters. They report that since
discharge from rehab on [**1-19**], the patient has had gradually
worsened SOB. Lately, he has been unable to sleep in bed (even
when head of bed is elevated) and has preferred sleeping in his
wheelchair. He has been on 2L continous nc at home since [**1-19**],
but over the past 2 weeks, has noticed increasing dyspnea. No
cough above baseline, no fevers. + sick contacts at home ([**Name (NI) **])
in his grandson and great-grandchildren. Family also has noted
increased ankle swelling and edema in the patient's thighs. They
report that his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], increased his dose of Lasix
from 40 mg PO qday to 60 mg qday about 1 month ago and then to
80 mg PO qday about 1.5 weeks ago with little improvement. He
was scheduled to see his PCP in clinic today, but the family
decided to bring him to the ED instead.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 97.8  77  148/86  20  94% on 4L (on
[**1-27**].5L home O2). Exam was notable for LE edema and rales; and
small wounds on L LE. CXR showed no definite effusion, pulmonary
edema, and possible pneumonia in RLL. Otherwise, labs
significant for HCO3 39, Trop 0.25, lactate 1.5. R LENI was
negative for DVT. The patient was treated with Lasix 80 mg IV to
which he responded well - oxygen requirement decreased to 2L.
Ceftriaxone 1g/azithromycin 500 mg were started to treat CAP.
.
Of note, the patient was hospitalized from [**Date range (2) 19889**] for
respiratory failure and sepsis requiring intubation and
pressors. He was treated for pneumonia, pulmonary edema; course
was complicated by SVT and ATN. The patient was discharged to a
rehab facility. He left the rehab facility for home on [**1-19**] at
the request of his family. At home, the patient is
wheelchair-bound and requires 2-2.5L of home O2.
.
Currently, VS 98.9  80  110/60  20  92% on 3L. The patient
appears mildly dyspneic but is able to speak in short sentences.
He is alert and oriented x 3. Exam reveals rales 1/2 up
posterior lung fields, 2+ pitting edema up to thights and lower
extremity venous stasis changes but no obvious cellulitis or
infection. He does report PND and has not been sleeping well for
the past few nights. His family reports that his diet is poor -
meals on wheels helps with many meals and that he does not
monitor his salt intake.
.
Endorses diarrhea 2 weeks ago (has ostomy [**1-27**] rectal cancer) and
occasional urinary hesitancy
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, BRBPR, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
pulmonary artery is not well visualized. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2144-12-21**], no obvious change but the technicalloy
suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive
comparison.
.
Admission CXR:
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes and pulmonary edema. No definite
pleural
effusion seen on the lateral view. Bibasilar opacities, which
may relate to
atelectasis from low lung volumes and overlying edema. In the
appropriate
clinical setting, consolidation from aspiration or infection
would be
difficult to exclude.
.
R LE Doppler: negative for DVT
.
