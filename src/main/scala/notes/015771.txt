History of Present Illness:
(obtained from transfer medical records, OMR, and transfer s/o)
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**] is a 59-year-old right-handed woman with history of
HTN, HLD, COPD on home O2, CHF, cervical and endometrial
adenocarcinoma, paraganglioma of the left skull base s/p
radiation, seizure disorder due to paraneoplastic limbic
encephalitis who is transferred from OSH intubated after episode
of unresponsiveness for further of current presentation and
skull base tumor. Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**] initially presented to OSH on
[**2186-8-24**] after having a transient (seconds to minutes) loss of
consciousness. She was sitting at the dining room table with her
mother when she went from alert, at baseline, to snoring
respirations. She then fell off her chair to the right and lost
consciousness. No activity concerning for seizure. By time EMS
arrived she had returned to baseline alertness. In the ED she
was found to have a UTI and was started on cipro and admitted.
On [**2186-8-25**] neurology and heme/onc were consulted for the
transient LOC. She had had 2 prior epsiodes similar in nature in
the past 6 weeks, although one of these was possibly in the
setting of choking. During all 3 of these events it was unclear
why she had the transient LOC as she had normal EEGs and TTEs.
On [**2186-8-26**] she was noted to be more confused and was hypoxic. The
rapid response team was called, and after further decompensating
to unresponsiveness with a O2 sat of 92% on high flow O2 (35%),
she was intubated. Notes indicate that blood was flowing out of
the nasal trumpet. She was initially hypertensive but then
required pressors for blood pressure support. She was
transferred to the ICU. They could find no clear cause for the
decompensation. Of note her INR was therapeutic at admission,
decreased to 1.8 on [**8-25**], and then again therapeutic [**8-26**]. It
appears coumadin was continued until yesterday, when it was held
for pending evaluation here of skull base tumor. On [**2186-8-28**] they
noted that the patient was alert and could follow commands but
they were unable to wean her from the vent. Given concern that
the skull base lesion may be contributing, they pursued transfer
here as her Neuro-oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].

Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**] was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic [**2186-8-21**] for a
putative, non-biopsy proven, paraganglioma of the left skull
base, invasive. The patient has undergone radiation, without
resection, of this lesion.  This paraganglioma has since
enlarged extending further, invasive of the left skull base and
petrous temporal bone. Her last brain MRI was done [**2-/2186**]
(report in Atrius) which noted that "there was a marked increase
in size of the metastatic lesion in the left petrous apex bone.
There is extension of the mass into the posterior fossa, the
foramen magnum, and into the infratemporal fossa on the left.
The lesion has increased in size from approximately 1.5 cm to
4.5 cm in size."

With respect to Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**]' oncologic history, a paraneoplastic
limbic encephalitis was the first presenting suggestion of an
oncologic process.  She developed a complex partial seizure
disorder greater than three years ago culminating in the
diagnosis of a paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis with increased
FLAIR signal in both medial and temporal lobes on MRI.  She
received one course of IVIG, steroids and plasmapheresis which
apparently halved the antibody titer.  The primary tumor giving
rise to the paraneoplastic process was not found.  Nonetheless,
around the same time, she was diagnosed with a synchronous
cervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma.  The grade of the
cervical carcinoma was T1N1M1,and the grade of the endometrial
adenocarcinoma was grade I, T1b. She underwent resection with
chemoradiation for these.

The seizure disorder is characterized by complex partial
seizures which do not generalize. The husband does not notice
the seizures, but the daughter notices them, and these have been
previously captured on EEG, per the patient.  Per the husband,
the daughter notices a vacant look, and the patient seems spacey
for a short time.

Early last summer, the patient began to experience difficulty
swallowing.  She had difficulty swallowing boluses with gagging,
choking, and demonstrated projectile vomiting.  Soon after this,
she was noted to have a hoarse voice.  Workup included imaging
of
the skull base, which included an MRI in [**Month (only) 956**] this year as a
follow up set of images.  The MRI read from [**Month (only) 956**] suggests "a
metastatic lesion."  Thus, paraganglioma was considered the most
likely diagnosis.  She saw an ear, nose and throat surgeon at
[**Hospital 13128**] who suggested that intervention surgically
would
be dangerous and result in significant morbidity given the
location of the tumor at the skull base adjacent to cranial
nerves and great vessels.  Therefore, she underwent radiation
treatment with the radiation to it including the left skull base
and the lesion.  There has been no biopsy of this lesion to
demonstrate its underlying nature.  She has not undergone Gamma
Knife or proton beam therapy.  She was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in
[**Hospital **] clinic to discuss surgical intervention or proton beam
or Gamma Knife intervention.

Although hoarseness appeared almost one year ago, it has
recently
worsened.  Hoarseness had appeared last summer, improved about
three months ago, and then worsened again about two months ago.
At the present time, her husband, also with her on the visit
today, and the patient deny a modified diet, but it does appear
that the husband is giving her food that is easier to swallow at
the present time.  She is taking thin liquids and somewhat soft
solids.  She denied any difficulty swallowing recently with no
choking or vomiting.

Of note, in clinic the patient mentions a left-sided ptosis that
has appeared about two months ago. No appreciated change in
sweating on
the left side of the face.

ROS: unable, pt is intubated.
