.
CXR ([**9-3**]): Persistent bibasilar opacities. Development of new
opacity in the right upper lobe as described above. Given the
current clinical situation, multifocal pneumonia would be the
likely cause.
.
MRI ([**9-5**]): IMPRESSION. 1.  No mass or abnormal enhancement in
the brain or meninges. 2.  Findings consistent with bilateral
mastoiditis and mucosal thickening in both sphenoid sinuses.  3.
 Generalized brain atrophy.
.
EEG ([**9-7**]): No focal abnormalities or epileptiform features were
seen.
.
CT of Head ([**9-10**]): IMPRESSION:  Severe destruction  and  fluid
replacement of bilateral mastoid air cells, right greater than
left. In the right petrous bone there is osseous destruction
anteriorly that might indicate possible spread to the
intracranial
compartment. Demineralization of the sigmoid plate is present
posteriorly. We recommend MRI of the brain and also MRV.
.
MRI ([**9-11**]): IMPRESSION: 1.  Increased enhancement of bilateral
mastoids and part of the petrous bones, opacified with complex
fluid, most likely due to infection.  2.  New small subdural
complex fluid collections in bilateral frontal regions with
meningeal enhancement.  These findings are worrisome for
meningeal spread of the infection.  3.  No obvious
intraparenchymal abnormality at this stage.
.
MRI ([**9-13**]) IMPRESSION:
1.  Acute left putaminal infarct, new in the interval.
2.  Unchanged appearance of bilateral mastoiditis with small
bilateral subdural fluid collections, with enhancement of the
surrounding meninges.
.
[**9-19**] EEG: IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to the very
frequent generalized sharp wave discharges with a left
hemisphere predominance. These discharges were generally
occurring every one to two seconds but not particularly
rhythmically. The suppressed background suggests a widespread
and severe encephalopathy affecting all areas. There was more
cortical dysfunction on the right, with lower voltage activity,
but the discharges suggest an area of increased cortical
hypersynchrony on the left with epileptogenic potential. These
discharges did not constitute a seizure at the time of the
recording, but they are worrisome for seizures at other times.
.
[**9-20**] EEG: This 24 hour video EEG telemetry demonstrated periodic
lateralized sharp epileptiform discharges most prominantly seen
over the left frontocentral and frontotemporal leads. The
background also
demonstrated a diffuse low voltage slowing. These findings are
suggestive of a left hemispheric focus superimposed on a more
widespread encephalopathy.
.
[**9-20**] CXR: Stable appearance of small bilateral pleural effusions
and small bibasilar consolidation which could represent
pneumonia or atelectasis.
.
[**9-21**] MR head: IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilateral extensive mastoid soft tissue changes.  Decrease
in meningeal enhancement seen on the previous MRI study.  No new
areas of signal abnormality or enhancement or fluid collection
seen.
2.  Evolution of left putaminal infarct.
3.  Diffuse brain atrophy could be related to HIV
encephalopathy.
4.  No new areas of enhancement.
.
[**9-24**] head CT IMPRESSION:
1. No new infarct or hemorrhage.
2. Status post right mastoidectomy with persistent opacification
in the region of surgery. Increased opacification in the left
mastoid air cell/middle ear cavity consistent with worsening
mastoiditis.
.
[**9-26**] Renal USN: Increased echogenicity in relation to the
kidneys bilaterally consistent with HIV nephropathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 40 y.o. woman with AIDS admitted with hypotension,
fever, pneumonia, anemia, UTI, and acute renal failure.  During
this hospitalization, the patient was transferred to the MICU on
several occasions for hypotension. After a long hospital stay
with a consistently declining status, the patient was made CMO
and expired while on the wards. The following issues were
addressed:
.
1. Infectious disease: The patient presented with b/l PNA and
developed a mastoiditis with extension into the subdural space.
Upon presentation an LP was done which was negative for
meningitis. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and ear drainage was
cultured. Viral cultures and stool cultures were also sent. The
patient grew out MSSA and pseudomonas from her sputum and coag
negative staph from her R ear. A right mastoidectomy was
performed. The patient was treated empirically with Vanco,
Ceftazadime, caspofungin, and acyclovir. As viral and fungal
cultures came back negative, the acyclovir and caspofungin were
stopped. ID was involved throughout the hospitalization and
suggested a 4 week course of the vanco and ceftazadime from the
time of debridement of the R mastoid. A repeat head CT on [**9-26**]
showed increasing L sided mastoiditis despite maximum medical
therapy. On [**10-2**], all antibiotics were stopped as the patient
had been anuric for three days and the antibiotics were
contributing to fluid overload and respiratory distress. The
patient was made CMO at that point and finally expired on [**10-8**].
.
A. Pneumonia: The patient presented with CXR and CT findings
consistent with a bilateral multi-focal pneumonia. A cavitary
lung lesion was also seen in the right
