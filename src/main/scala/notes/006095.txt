Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**]
Chief Complaint:
became unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated, Cerebral Angio, MERCI and IA tPA

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 77 y/o with a hx of CAD, s/p 5 vessel CABG 5 days ago,
HTN, Ulcerative colitis, who is brought in after suddenly
becoming unresponsive this morning.  History is her his
daughter, who was present during the incident.

Daughter reports that she woke her father up around 8:30 this
morning.  He said "gee, you'd think I'd feel better after a good
night's sleep," and she assumed he was having incisional pain.
Otherwise he seemed himself, and was talking normally, answering
her questions.  Then all of the sudden his eyes rolled back in
his head and he became unresponsive.  He seemed to be snoring or
grunting through his nose, and his arms curled in to his body
and tensed up.  His body seemed rigid.  She got scared and
called 911 immediately.  We have no EMS report available, but
her daughter's report they checked his pulse and it was
initially strong, but then got more thready.  They started
bagging him.  By the time they started moving him to the
ambulance around 8:50 he didn't seem rigid anymore (she's not
sure how long this lasted, but guesses 10-15 minutes) and
actually slumped to the side when they put him in a wheelchair.
He was intubated in the ambulance on the way to the ER.  When he
arrived here the ED found that he was unresponsive and that his
pupils were fixed at 6 mm.  A Head CT was performed, which was
negative for any evidence of hemorrhage, and we were consulted.

His daughter reports that he's been recovering well after his
surgery, and has been up to the bathroom by himself.  When his
visiting nurse came yesterday she heard some crackles at the
bases, but he had no fever.

TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The interatrial septum
is aneurysmal. Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum
raises the suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could
not be confirmed on the basis of this study. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac
thrombus. There is a dynamic interatrial septum, although a
septal defect was not well visualized.

MRI Brain:
Extensive bilateral PCA infarctions as well as left cerebellar
acute infarcts. Apparently restored flow to the tip of the
basilar artery, although evaluation is limited by motion
degradation on the MRA.

CTA:
1. Findings consistent with a basilar tip thrombus. The thrombus
covers the origins of the posterior cerebral and superior
cerebellar arteries bilaterally.
2. CT perfusion images support a bilateral PCA territory
ischemia, particularly given the CTA finding and clinical
history.
3. Atherosclerotic calcifications most prominent at bilateral
carotid artery bifurcations.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68224**] was taken emergently to the neurointerventional
suite and underwent a cerebral angiogram. The occlusion of the
top of the basilar artery was visualized and IA tPA was given in
attempt to dissolve the clot. MERCI was also attempted and part
of the thrombus was removed, however there was residual
occlusion of the L PCA. He was then transferred to the ICU for
further management.

He was maintained with a SBP of 130-170. Shortly after
admission, he began to have intermittent afib. This was
therefore felt to be the mechanism for his infarction.
Anticoagulation was not an option given his recent CABG.
Therefore a TEE was done the following day which showed no
thrombus. He was started on aspirin. His screening labs were
checked and his A1c was 5.5, HDL was 31 and LDL was 57. He was
maintained normothermic and normoglycemic. An MRI was done that
evening. It showed extensive infarction of bilateral PCA
distributions.

On admission, CE were done which showed a mild troponin bump of
0.35 at the peak. This gradually tended down and his ECG showed
no dynamic changes. He was started on aspirin 81mg again after
24 hours.

Over the first 24 hours of his admission, his HCT dropped to 22.
It remained stable and iron studies were consistent with chronic
disease. His retic count was also appropriately elevated. He was
transfused 2 units PRBC with a good response.

On admission, a CXR was done which showed a retrocardiac
opacification. He was also febrile but had a normal white count.
He was started on levoquin and pan cultured. This was treated
for 7 days but he still had a LLL infiltrate and fevers
intermittently. He was cultured repeatedly and grew out coag
negative staff in [**12-24**] sets which was felt to be likely
contaminant. None the less, he was treated with Vanco and the
art line was removed.

During his hospital course, his neurologic exam remained
essentially [**Date Range 1506**]. He did not
