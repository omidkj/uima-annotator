Service: Medicine
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48 year-old smoker
with no past medical history who presents with two days of
hemoptysis that is progressively worsening.  The patient noted a
cough with bloody sputum production on the day prior to
admission.  This increasingly worsened with frank blood being
coughed up by the spoonful.  The patient reports roughly 1200 cc
of hemoptysis prior to admission and was noted to have 100 cc of
hemoptysis in the first two hours of admission on the floor.  The
patient was quickly transferred to the MICU for a two day MICU
stay where he was monitored for progression of his hemoptysis.
The patient notes a forty pound weight loss in the last six
months and a sixty pound weight loss in the last two years along
with worsening fatigue, occasional night sweats and fevers that
were subjective and not measured.  The patient has no history of
sick contacts or known tuberculosis contacts, however, he does
report being incarcerated in the late [**2097**].  The patient does
complain of a chronic cough that he relates to his smoking,
however, it is usually not a productive cough and he has never
seen blood in his sputum before.  The patient denies bright red
blood per rectum.  He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or
constipation.  He denies intravenous drug abuse or other drug
abuse.  The patient does admit to drinking two to four beers per
day.  The patient has no recent travel.  No history of tick
bites.  The patient has no pets at home.  The patient is
monogamous with his girlfriend. [**Name (NI) **] has no risk factors for HIV.
The patient has no family history or prior history of hemoptysis
or bleeding problems.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 98.6 temperature.  Pulse 76.
Blood pressure 140/80.  Respiratory rate 20.  The patient was
sating 98% on room air.  Generally, the patient was in no acute
distress.  He was alert and oriented times three.  HEENT
examination pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact. Conjunctiva were pink.  No icterus
noted.  Oropharynx was noteworthy for dried blood on the lips and
the tongue.  No lesions in the oropharynx were noted, however. No
ulcerations.  Neck examination was supple.  No lymphadenopathy.
No JVP.  Lung examination is diffuse, coarse breath sounds with
occasional bronchial breath sounds at the bases.  No wheezes.
Heart examination regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Negative Kussmaul sign.  Abdominal examination was
soft, nontender, active bowel sounds.  The liver edge was 2 cm
below the costal margin.  No splenomegaly.  No costovertebral
angle tenderness.  Multiple spider angiomata were noted.
Gynecomastia was noted.  Testicular examination was deferred.
Extremities the patient had no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
and posterior tibial pulses.  No cyanosis or clubbing.
Neurological cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  The
patient moved all extremities well.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.4, hemoglobin 16.5,
hematocrit 49.5, mean corpuscular volume 98, 59% neutrophils,
31% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 3% eosinophils, 1+ macrocytes,
253 platelets, INR 1.3, PTT 32.5.  Sed rate was 2.
Urinalysis revealed 100 mg per deciliter of protein, 100 mg
per deciliter of glucose, trace ketones, small amount of
bili, no whites, no reds, no bacteria, no yeast.  Nitrite
negative.  Leukocyte esterase negative.  Sodium 137,
potassium 4.1, chloride 101, bicarb 24, BUN 10, creatinine
.7, glucose 100.  ALT 70, AST 209, alkaline phosphatase 59,
amylase 83, total bilirubin .9, lipase 28, calcium 9.3, phos
3.3, albumin 4.0, osmolality 303.  Tox screen was negative
for aspirin, ethanol, acetaminophen, benzodiazepines,
barbiturates and tricyclics and antidepressants.  Sputum gram
stain revealed multiple organisms consistent with
oropharyngeal flora.  Acid fast sputum smear was negative on
admission.  Urine culture revealed no growth.  Chest CT on
admission revealed multifocal areas of small nodular
opacities in the central lobular distribution.  Some of these
may be partially explained by aspiration of blood especially
at the left lower lobe.  Nevertheless this appearance also
raises the possibility of an infectious process such as
mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, or less likely
tuberculosis, however, no discreet marginated nodules are
seen.  No intrabronchial lesions are identified, although
retained secretions are noted within the left main stem
bronchus and left lower lobe bronchi.  Chest x-ray revealed
bilateral lower lobe ill defined opacities.
Electrocardiogram was sinus rhythm with a rate of 93, left
axis deviation, nonspecific repolarization changes and
meeting frequency isolated ventricular premature beats,
borderline left anterior hemiblock.  No previous tracings
were available for comparison.  Intervals were normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hemoptysis:  As described in the history of
present illness the patient was quickly transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for close observation in light of what
qualified as massive hemoptysis.  The patient did not require
blood transfusions.  His hematocrit remained above 47 throughout
his hospitalization.  The patient did receive intravenous fluids
of normal saline and was taken for bronchoscopy on [**2130-10-4**].  Bronchoscopy only revealed blood in the rhonchi and
revealed no evidence of the etiology of the patient's bleeding.
No endobronchial lesions were found either on bronchoscopy or on
CT scan.  CT scan was discussed with the pulmonary team and there
was some thought that the patient had some evidence of
bronchiectasis on the CT scan that was not reported by the
official radiology read.  It was thought that the bronchiectasis
noted was a likely cause of the patient's bleeding as the patient
is a chronic smoker with chronic cough and frequent upper
respiratory infections.  The patient was tested for HIV and this
was negative.  Wegner's was considered but P-ANCA was negative.
Lupus was considered but [**Doctor First Name **] was negative.  Goodpasture's was
entertained in light of the patient's recent abdominal CT scan
that showed possible hemorrhagic cyst in the left kidney,
however, the patient had no hematuria during his hospitalization.
Antibasement membrane antibodies were pending at discharge.
Additionally alpha 1 antitrypsin was pending at discharge along
with immunoelectrophoresis.

The patient stopped having hemoptysis on hospital day number
two.  The patient's hemoptysis had slowed significantly and total
amount of hemoptysis was thought to be 1500 cc including what he
reported from home.  The patient had no episodes of hemoptysis
for 48 hours prior to discharge.  The patient was ruled out for
tuberculosis with three serial sputum AFBs including BAL, AFBs
that were all negative for acid fast bacteria.  The patient was
encouraged to follow up in the Pulmonary Clinic to follow up with
the tests that were pending at discharge and evaluate the
etiology of the patient's hemoptysis.

ETOH withdraw:  The patient was covered with a CIWA Ativan scale
throughout his hospitalization and required no Ativan during his
hospitalization and showed no signs of alcohol withdrawal.
However, the patient was given thiamine, folate and multivitamins
in light of his seemingly malnutrition state with an INR of 1.3
to 1.4.  The patient was also given vitamin K po as this was
thought to be a nutritional deficit.

Muscle spasms:  The patient after further questioning also
reported some  muscles spasms in his hands bilaterally in the
last several months.  He reported that when he would be raking
leaves or using his hands or had his hands clenched that they
would become locked in place and he would have to pry them open
with other objects.  This symptom is particularly concerning for
the diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy.  However, this is by no
means a specific finding. The patient should be followed closely
in this sense and should undergo further cardiac testing as
patient's with myotonic dystrophy tend to be subjected to
cardiomyopathies with condu
