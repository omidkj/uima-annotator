History of Present Illness:
85 yo M with past medical history significant for hypertension,
SSS and VT s/p AICD and known aortic stenosis who presented to
OSH with urinary retention for
one day. He also reported left hip pain, lower back pain,left
leg weakness, and bowel incontinence. He was also noted to have
leukocytosis with WBC 23.7  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for CT

Pre-bypass:
The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with trivial mitral stenosis. The anterior mitral leaflet
appears to have minimal mobility. Due to co-existing aortic
regurgitation, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve
area may be an OVERestimation of true mitral valve area. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Post-bypass: The patient is receiving vasopressin 3 units/hr and
phenylephrine 1.5 mcg/kg/min post-CPB. There is a well-seated
bioprosthesis in the aortic position with good leaflet
excursion. There is no paravalvular or transvalvular
regurgitation. The mean transvalvular gradient is 5 mm Hg with a
cardiac output of 4.7 L/min. Biventricular systolic function is
preserved and all other findings are consistent with pre-bypass
findings. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 y/o man with history of A.Fib as well as asthma, who
presented to OSH with L hip pain, difficulty walking, and
urinary retention; transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern for
compressive spinal cord lesion and need for urgent CT myelogram.
CT myelogram showed severe canal narrowing with questionable
adjacent soft tissue density. CT torso did not show evidence of
malignancy, and his PSA was within normal limits. Blood cultures
were drawn, considering the patient's elevated WBC on
presentation; however, they did not grow anything. Neurosurgery
recommended laminectomy; however, pre-op echo showed critical
aortic stenosis (worsened from prior echos). Pre-op cath showed
left main disease. As a result, it was determined that the
patient would undergo aortic valve replacement and CABG prior to
his laminectomy.

After preoperative workup on [**5-22**] the patient underwent an
aortic valve replacement with a 29-mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Cinch
aortic valve bioprosthesis, coronary artery bypass grafting x2,
with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery and reversed saphenous vein single
graft from the
aorta to the ramus intermedius coronary artery.  Total bypass
time 130 minutes and cross clamp time of 100 minutes.  See
operative note for full details.  The operation went without
complications and the patient was transferred to the intensive
care unit in stable condition.  He was inappropriately pacing
and his PPM was interrogated post operatively by the EP service
and his mode was changed to DDIR.  He was weaned off all
vasoactive medications and extubated without incidence.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery
protocol.  Sotalol was restarted at home dose per cardiologist
recommendations with Lopressor discontinued.  He was transferred
to the step down unit and continued to work with physical
therapy for increased strength and endurance.
He was preoperatively treated with Ciprofloxacin for an urinary
tract infection with coag neg Staphylococcus.  Post operative
urinalysis was negative and per the infectious disease team,
there is no need for prophylactic antibiotics with indwelling
foley (foley is to remain in until spinal surgery in 1 month.)
He is to have weekly UA and cultures sent at rehab with
aggressive treatment of any urinary tract infection.
Of note, a pulmonary nodule was note on a preoperative chest CT
and this needs to be followed up in 6 months.
At the time of discharge, the patient was pleasant and
cooperative (not oriented to time).  He was tolerating a full
oral diet, his incisions were healing well and he was ambulating
with assistance.  It was felt that he was safe for transfer to
rehab on post operative day 4.

Pulmonary nodule on CT scan - Six month follow-up recommended.
