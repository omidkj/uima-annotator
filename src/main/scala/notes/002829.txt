HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
72 M s/p renal transplant and CRF, diastolic CHF EF 45-50%, s/p
CABG and [**First Name3 (LF) 1291**] on coumadin, DM2, vasculopath with L fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass
and revisions, CHF, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**2185-9-14**] after
a 2 month admission for osteomyelitis, ARF, and CHF
exacerbation. Today he was sent from NH to [**Hospital3 8544**] for
decreased responsiveness and AMS intermittantly over last week.
BG was found to be 34 with rapid recovery in responsiveness with
D50. Found him to be hyperkalemic in ARF, with TnT 0.367 (same
as Troponin here). Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today because of his 2
month admission here recently.
.
Family reported increasing full body swelling and worsening
dyspnea from baseline for the past week. EKG shows 1.5 mm STE in
V1-V3, 1mm on old EKGs for comparison. Patient is DNR/DNI,
patient and family did not wish to have cardiac cath performed.
Patient has never had CP, but has had intermittent dyspnea.
.
In the ED, HR60s, BP105-110, 99% 2L nc, BG108, received ASA,
plavix, did not give integrillin because of renal failure. INR
4.9 for anticoagulation for [**Hospital1 1291**], heparin gtt was not started.
For hyperkalemia of K 5.9 and 6.0, patient received calcium,
insulin, glucose, and he had received kayexylate at OSH. CXR
shows pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions. Trop 0.38, MB 8,
no CK drawn.
.
.
MICU course:
Found to be in oliguric renal failure with decreased urine
output for 5 days prior to admission. Started hemodialysis on
[**8-6**] for Uremia, volume overload. Supratheraputic INR on
admission, unable to biopsy kidney for diagnosis, given Vit K.
INR subtheraputic (with goal 2.5-3.5), restarted on coumadin and
Heparin GTT until coumadin theraputic. Also given solu-medrol
500mg x3 days to treat for rejection.

Pertinent Results:
[**2185-10-21**] Repeat Echocardiogram
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate  global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40
%). Right ventricular  chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. A bileaflet aortic valve  prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with  normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral
valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is  severe mitral annular calcification. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be  significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Suboptimal  image quality - patient unable to cooperate.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2185-10-8**], the findings are similar (ejection
fraction overestimated on prior  study).
.
[**2185-10-20**] Head CT
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.

2.  Central involutional changes and evidence of small vessel
angiopathy.
.
[**2185-10-8**] Echocardiogram:.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %), no
regionality seen. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular systolic function
is borderline normal. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-8-23**], no
significant change.
.
[**2185-10-7**] CXR -
IMPRESSION: New consolidation in the right lower lobe that may
reflect aspiration. Followup radiographs will help distinguish
atelectasis from pneumonia. Interval improvement in pulmonary
edema.
.
[**2185-10-6**] Renal Transplant U/S
Doppler examination of the main transplant renal artery and
interpolar arterials demonstrates normal systolic upstroke with
absent diastolic flow. The resistive index is 1.0. This is not
significantly chnaged. The transplant renal [**Month/Day/Year 5703**] is patent.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of transplant kidney with elevated
resistive indeces. No
evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric collection
