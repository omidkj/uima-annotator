Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year-old
male who was found down at home under his car after missing
for three days most likely the patient rolled off the road
and the patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital6 10443**], intubated and transferred here.

The patient's past medical history is significant for
prostate cancer and upon admission to the Emergency Room the
patient's examination, pupils were sluggish, tongue was
midline and no blood in the nare or the ears.  Chest was
clear and heart was regular rate and rhythm on admission.
The patient also had some right shoulder bruises.  Bilateral
distal pulses are palpable.  The patient's rectal examination
was guaiac negative.  At the time of admission the patient
underwent a CT scan of the head, which was negative and CT C
spine, which was negative and abdominal CT was negative.  The
only significant for a right ureteral stone and TLS spine
films were all negative.  Chest x-ray was negative for
pneumothorax and the patient was subsequently admitted to the
Trauma Surgery Service for further evaluation and management.
Patient had an x-ray of the right shoulder, which showed
right clavicular distal fracture and with apparent loss of
corticoclavicular ligament and orthopedic surgery was called
to see the patient and it appeared the clavicular fracture
was stable and they recommended nonoperative management of
the fracture.  The patient was also placed on C spine
precaution, although CT of the C spine was negative, however,
due to altered mental status we were not able to clear the C
spine and urology was consulted for an obstructing right
kidney stone.  Urology decided not to place a percutaneous
nephrostomy tube and would just follow his renal stone.

The patient was continued to be monitored in the Intensive
Care Unit subsequently and a right radial artery A line was
then placed on hospital day number two and also a right
subclavian central line was also placed.  On chest x-ray the
patient has a lot of secretions and the patient underwent a
bronchoscopy on hospital day number two, which cleared a lot
of secretions, but no other abnormality finding was found on
the bronchoscopy.  The patient also had an epidural placed
for pain control.  On the CT scan done at admission the final
read also showed that the patient had some old left frontal
infarct and basal ganglion and calcification, but no acute
bleed or acute infarct was seen.  On hospital day number
three the patient was extubated, however, due to increased
secretion and worsening metabolic acidosis the patient
required reintubation on the same day.  On hospital day
number four the patient was started on tube feeds and
appeared to be tolerating tube feed well and Zosyn was then
started for some left lower lobe infiltrate, which was seen
on the chest x-ray.  The patient was started on Fluconazole
per ID recommendation on the [**4-29**] for some
yeast, which was growing from urine.  Three days of
Fluconazole was given until the yeast was cleared.

On [**10-1**] his subclavian catheter was changed over the
wire due to fear of 38.1, however, the patient's white count
is only 14.  The antibiotics were continued and repeat chest
x-ray subsequently showed the patient continued to have left
lower lobe infiltrate.  There was a question of pneumonia
versus aspiration event and the patient was failed to
extubate continuously, although the patient appeared to be
doing well on pressure support ventilation.  The patient
underwent another bronchoscopy on [**10-6**], which showed
left lower collapse and large amount of purulent secretion
was washed out.  The patient was continued on the Zosyn and
Fluconazole.  His respiratory condition appeared to be
improved and respiratory culture grew out gram negative rods
and staph aureus, which is pan sensitive and also a
_________________.  The patient was continued on the current
course of antibiotics.  Due to the patient's repeat failure
of extubation it was decided the patient would require a
trach and PEG.  The procedure was performed on [**10-11**]
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**].  The trach and PEG was performed without any
incidents and post procedure chest x-ray showed trach in good
position and will begin giving the patient po medication via
his PEG, which appeared to be tolerating that fine and the
patient was deemed ready for discharge on [**2146-10-12**].

Prior to discharge the patient was afebrile, vital signs were
stable and he was responsive and follows commands, although
mental status wise he is still appeared to be somewhat
confused and is not quite appropriate.  His chest was clear
to auscultation except for some mild basal rales on the left
side.  The patient's belly was soft, nontender, nondistended.
The PEG site was clean and trach site appeared to be clean.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post motor vehicle accident found down under his
car.
2.  Old left frontal infarct and basal ganglia and
calcifications.
3.  Right shoulder distal clavicular fracture, which required
nonoperative management.
4.  Right renal stone, which urology recommended follow up
and nonoperative management.
5.  Failure to wean off ventilator.
6.  Status post trach and PEG.
7.  History of prostate cancer.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
2.  Heparin subq 5000 units b.i.d.
3.  Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d.
4.  Zantac 150 mg po b.i.d.
5.  Levaquin 500 mg po q day for another seven days.  The
antibiotics will end on [**2146-10-19**].
6.  Nystatin ointment prn.
7.  Atrovent nebulizers one to two puffs q 4 hours prn.

FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to follow up in the
Trauma Clinic in approximately seven to eight weeks and the
patient is to follow up with urology in three to four weeks
after discharge and the patient is also to follow up with the
[**Hospital **] Clinic in four to five weeks after discharge for
his distal clavicular fracture.  Meanwhile, due to his
altered mental status we are unable to clear his C spine,
although radiological studies has shown no fracture.  The
patient is to remain on Aspen collar for about eight weeks
from the day of discharge and the patient is to remain on
trach collar.  The patient can be weaned off vent as
tolerated.  The patient will be getting Impact with fiber
tube feeds starting at 10 cc an hour and tube feeds can be
