Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
C. perfringens bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
51yo M PMHx polysubstance abuse, strep viridans endocarditis s/p
St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] MVR on coumadin, EtoH and HCV Cirhosis c/b ascites,
prior GI bleeds (without known varices) initially presenting to
OSH from Addiction [**Hospital6 91328**] for pancytopenia (WBC 1.1,
Hct 26, platelets 54), was found to be hypotensive (SBP80s) with
strongly guaiac positive stools; he was started on octreotide
and famotidine gtts with stabilization of Hct in the upper 20,
low 30s; also found to have low grade fevers, with blood
cultures growing out GPRs (clostridium perfringens, one of two
bottles), for which he was treated with ciprofloxacin,
clindamycin; source of bacteremia was felt to be cholecystitis
based on exam and CT imaging that demontrated pericholestatic
fluid, gallbladder wall thickening; patient was trasferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further surgical management on [**2161-8-9**].  Patient was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] SICU.  On further questioning patient endorsed
~3wks melena and nosebleeds prior to admission, also reported
sharp, constant periumbilical pain, withut
nausea/vomiting/constipation/diarrhea.  Regarding concern for
cholecystitis, patient abx changed to vanco/zosyn per ID
recommendations, but then had HIDA scan w/o evidence of
cholecystitis, edematous gallbladder attributed to ascites;
given bacteremia had TTE that did not demonstrate any signs of
acute valvular pathology, but did demonstrate severe AS.
Patient had heparin drip initiated for subtherapeutic INR.
Hepatology service was consulted given patient's cirrhosis.
.
Remainder of SICU course was remarkable for continued fevers,
hypotension requiring levophed drip and development of acute
respiratory distress [**2161-8-12**], O2sat high 80s, low 90s on NRB.
Patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure (ABG
7.30/53/63). CXR demonstrated bibasilar opacities, concerning
for aspiration PNA.  As source of fevers/hypotension remained
uncertain, patient's abx were broadened to meropenem and
vancomycin.  On day of transfer, patient underwent bronch
without clear findings (no cultures sent).
.
On transfer to MICU, the patient remained intubated and sedated,
with PIV, triple lumen [**Last Name (LF) 14938**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Flexiseal, Foley in place.
Given patient intubated, unable to perform perform review of
systems.

BCx [**8-11**] X2 NGTD
BCx [**8-12**] X2 NGTD

Catheter tip [**8-10**] negative
Urine [**8-10**], 16, 17 negative
Sputum [**8-12**] gram stain and cultures negative
.
RUQ:
1. Essentially no significant change in comparison to prior
study from [**2161-8-10**]. Markedly thickened gallbladder wall with gallstones
within the
gallbladder lumen. Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, the
GB wall
thickening is likely related to patient's underlying liver
disease.
2. Moderate ascites.
3. Stable right pleural effusion.
4. Splenomegaly.
.
CXR:
Cardiac size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. Small bilateral
pleural
effusions, larger on the right side, are grossly unchanged with
associated
left greater than right lower lobe atelectasis. Left PICC tip is
at the
cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac size is
normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
51yo M PMHx strep viridans endocarditis s/p St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] MVR,
cirhosis p/w GIB, admitted with bacteremia, hypotension, course
complicated by respiratory failure and intubation, who was
subsequently extubated and transferred to general medicine
floor.

# C. perfringens bacteremia: Per ID, likely GI source, although
no signs biliary obstruction on CT scan, and no evidence
cholecyctitis on HIDA.  Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for
SBP and TTE neg for endocarditis.  Pt remained stable on
meropenem/vanco but spiked fever once to 100.9 on general
medicine floor.  repeat blood cultures at that time were
negative, repeat RUQ u/s was unchanged, and attempt to repeat
paracentesis was unsuccessful due to lack of tappable pocket.
No further fever spikes were recorded and pt reported feeling
well and denied subjective fevers.  He remained stable and
afebrile after this and received a 14d total course of vanc and
meropenem, which was discontinued the morning of [**2161-8-23**].

# Aspiration / HCAP: Pt w aspiration event in ICU resulting in
hypoxic respiratory failure leading to intubation; patient had
initially been covered w zosyn/vanco for above bacteremia, then
broadened with respiratory distress / fever episodes.  He was
extubated without issues and was weaned to room air on the
general medicine floor.  He continued to have a productive
[**Date Range **], but had no oxygen requirement on the general medicine
floor.  He was placed on nebs for a short course due to mild
wheezing on exam, but denied shortness of breath throughout the
rest of his hospital stay.  He spiked one fever to 100.9 while
on the floor but no cause was identified (see above).  He
finished a 14d total course of vancomycin/meropenem and reported
significant improvement in breathing and [**Date Range **] by the time of
discharge.

#Pancytopenia: Chronic process per OSH records, likely [**1-28**]
chronic cirrhosis; received 1 dose neupogen in SICU w rise in
ANC >1000.  Started on multivitamin and folate daily for anemia.
 Arranged for outpatient follow up with liver specialist.

#s/p MVR: Pt has a mechanical [**Hospital3 **] valve with INR goal
2.5-3.5.  He was started on a heparin drip to bridge coumadin.
INR became supratherapeutic and coumadin was held until INR
reached 1.7, after which coumadin was restarted at 2mg po daily.
 He will require outpatient follow up at coumadin clinic to
follow up steady state levels on [**2161-8-26**].

#Aortic stenosis: Present on OSH TTE [**3-/2161**], now [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 109**] 0.8.  Pt
was initially euvolemic but began to develop pitting edema in LE
bilaterally around [**2161-8-20**], so spironolactone was started, as
process was thought most likely secondary to liver disease.  LE
edema continued to worsen and pt continued to have [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a
repeat CXR on [**2161-8-23**] was done w
