catherization

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 76 yo female with h/o DM, CAD (cath '[**51**]-> 40% distal
LMCA, 60% mRCA, mild LAD and Cx disease) previously managed
medically, HTn and s/p AV pacer for unspecified bradyarrythmia
who presented from OSH for emergent cath with STE inferior MI.
Recent history includes a nuclear stress test on [**2157-6-19**] showing
a small, mild, fixed apical defect.  Pt describes several weeks
of chest pain for which she attributed to a chest cold which
became increasingly severe until initial presentation on [**9-12**].
Pt was found to be hypertensive (192/94) hyperglycemic (648),
CPK [**2159**], MB 177 and trop 4.36.  ECG was paced but showed
evidence of possible ST depressions inferiorly.  Immediately
upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], Pt underwent catherization which was
significant for thrombotically occluded mid RCA lesion which was
Cypher stented times two, as well as 40%LMCA and diffuse disease
elsewhere.  Hemodynamics showing RA 15, PCMP 21, CO 2.1, CI 1.3.
 Echo: EF25% with 3+MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] transfered to CCU for
close observation and management.

PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography demonstrated 100%
occluded distal
RCA. Integrilin was used prophylactically. A 6FJR4 guide offered
good
support. The lesion was crossed with a BMW wire and was dottered
with a
2.0 x 15 mm balloon establishing timi 3 flow. The lesion was
then
primary stented with a 2.5 x 13 mm cypher DES at 16 atms.
Angiography at
this point demonstrated a hazy lesion distal to the stent which
persisted despite slow 3 atm balloon inflation. This lesion was
stented
with a 2.5 x 8 mm Cypher DES at 14 atms with no residual
stenosis, no
dissection and timi 3 flow. The patient left the lab in a stable

condition.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
revealed
severe single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had an
ostial 30%
narrowing but not damping of the catheter was seen. The LAD had
mild
luminal irregularities and supplied two small diagonal branches
which
were also free of significant disease. The LCX supplied a single
large
OM branch before tapering very quickly into a small diffusely
diseased
AV groove vessel. The RCA had a 30% tubular lesion proximally
and was
thrombotically occluded in the mid vessel.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated left and
right
heart filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 15 mmHg and a
mean
PCW of 21 mmHg. There was evidence of moderate to severe
pulmonary
hypertension with a PA pressure of 72/30/46 mmHg and a PVR of
400
dynes-sec/cm5. The cardiac output was significantly depressed at
a level
of 2.1 L/min.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed given the patient's
elevated
filling pressures and underlying renal insufficiency.
4. Successful stenting of the distal RCA with 2.5 x 13 mm and
2.5 x 8 mm
cypher DES at 16 atms with no residual stenosis, no dissection
and timi
3 flow. See PTCA comments.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Successful stenting of the distal RCA.

INDICATION: Acute on chronic renal failure.

FINDINGS:

A portable examination was performed at the bedside. The
examination is technically limited due to the patient's
difficulty with breath holding.

No priors.

The kidneys are normal in size, shape and echogenicity, without
focal mass, hydronephrosis or calculus. The right kidney
measures 10.4 cm in length, and the left kidney measures 10.9
cm.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Based on [**2149**]
AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate a
moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions
regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe regional
left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Wit
severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior,
inferolateral,
and anterolateral walls. No discrete left ventricular thrombus
is seen, but
