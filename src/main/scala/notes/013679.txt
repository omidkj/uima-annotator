History of Present Illness:
42 year old male who was involved in a single car accident, was
the driver of a truck which rolled over multiple times.
Compartment was crushed. Patient recalls that he self extricated
himself from the vehicle by kicking out the back window of the
truck with his lower extremities.  He recalls feeling a lot of
pain at the time but does not know if his right lower extremity
was injured during the initial crash or when he was kicking out
the back window.  He was found prone in the median near the
rolled car. He was alert but disoriented. He has a large
avulsion injury to his right lower extremity, intact pulses. He
was intubated in the field with RSI when his pressure dropped
after c-collar was placed in ambulance. At outside hospital he
got vitamin K 10mg IV, tetanus shot, 1g Ancef.
.
INJURIES: RLE avulsion injury, Fractures of the bilateral first
transverse process, right posterior first rib, bilateral second
ribs, second right transverse process, fifth and sixth posterior
left ribs, Fracture C7 left lateral mass, collapsed RUL.


Past Medical History:
venous insufficiency
DVT RLE - [**2130**] (on coumadin)
PE - [**2130**] (on coumadin)


Social History:
Patient his wife, [**Name (NI) 87054**], are separated and he stays with his
mother in [**Name (NI) 8**] sometimes and helps care for her. He says he
is presently trying to get 'on her lease'.  Otherwise, he spends

supported by family and his faith and says he has good support
from his church community.


Family History:
No history of DVT/PE or hypercoagulable state to his knowledge.


Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
RLE with large full-thickness skin flap avulsion to lateral
lower leg, exposed muscle bellies. Damage to peroneal muscles
and tibialis anterior. DP/PT pulses dopplerable and symmetric.
Pt was intubated in field so unable to so sensory motor exam,
but does exhibit purposeful movements when examining flap. Flap
is from medial to lateral with flap still attached entirely on
the lateral side. Tissue is similar warmth to other exposed
skin. No evidence of vascular damage on CTA of RLE.

RADIOLOGY:
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-8-8**]
6:44 AM
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
Radiology Report -59 DISTINCT PROCEDURAL SERVICE Study Date of
[**2136-8-8**] 6:45 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Focal dissection at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus
extending from T10 to L1. Better characterization could be
obtained if desired with a dedicated CT angiographic study. No
surrounding hematoma

2. Complete right upper lobe collapse likely from aspirated
secretions

3. Endotracheal tube 5 cm above the carina.

4. Fractures of the bilateral first transverse processes, first
posterior
right rib, bilateral second posterior ribs,and fifth and sixth
left posterior ribs.
.
Radiology Report CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-8-8**]
6:45 AM
IMPRESSION: Fractures of the C7 lateral mass, the transverse
processes of T1 bilaterally, the right posterior first rib and
bilateral posterior second ribs though the second right rib
fracture is better seen on the accompanying CT Torso.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: In addition to the above, there
is an apparent significant disc herniation, possibly acute, at
C4-5, which effaces the ventral thecal sac and may indent the
underlying cord. This is poorly evaluated by this modality and
would be better-assessed by MR, which would also be warranted
(including axial T1-weighted sequences with fat-saturated
sequences), if there is suspicion of left vertebral arterial
injury in association with the C7 left posterior element
fracture.
.
Radiology Report CTA LOWER EXT W/&W/O C & RECONS BILAT Study
Date of [**2136-8-8**] 6:50 AM
IMPRESSION: Extensive right lower extremity skin and
subcutaneous tissue
defects without evidence for active extravasation or definite
signs of vessel injury. Please note the bolus timing was
suboptimal, limiting the study.
.
Radiology Report CTA PELVIS W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of
[**2136-8-11**] 5:00 PM
IMPRESSION: Technically limited study secondary to poor contrast
bolus. Allowing for this limitation, there is an intimal flap
again noted within the distal thoracic aorta starting near the
diaphragmatic hiatus and terminating above the renal arteries,
in a similar distribution as on the prior CT of [**8-8**].
.
Radiology Report UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT Study Date of
[**2136-8-12**] 2:49 PM
IMPRESSION: No DVT of the left upper extremity.
