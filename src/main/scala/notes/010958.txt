History of Present Illness:
64 yo M with h/o DM, asthma, bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism,
PCN allergy (s/p desensitization), with multiple admission for
treatment of recurrent bacteremia, T9-10 epidural abscess(MSSA),
and empyema requiring thoracic spine decompression and
decortication, found to have rise in WBC in [**Hospital **] clinic and sent
to ED for further evaluation.
.
Patient initally presented in [**2115-4-4**] with MSSA epidural
thoracic abscess with cord compression and empyema. He was also
noted to have C4-5 discitis and osteomyelitis. He also had
decortication of R lung for empyema. He was discharged on
[**2115-4-25**] on nafcillin.
.
The pt returned two weeks later with bilateral LE paralysis and
found to have recurrent thoracic epidural abscess requiring
emergent T8-11 laminectomy and debridement [**5-12**]. Blood cultures
from [**5-14**] revealed [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans and patient was started in
fluconazle. Pt returned to the OR for R thoracotomy, T9-T10
corpectomy w/ anterior thoracic fusion and posterior fusion. The
patient recured a chest tube [**1-5**] a PTX. The patient continued to
have low grade fevers and increased WBC. A BAL was performed
which showed serratia marcescens. The patient was treated for
VAP with 8 days of cipro. The patient had progression of CXR
innfiltrate, and was started on empiric vanco, zosyn,
fluconazole, which was narrowed to nafcillin, cipro, and
fluconazole with negative Bcx. A left thoracocentesis was
performed without growth on culture.
.
He was then readmitted on [**6-27**] with purulent drainage from
posterior midline incision. He went to OR for repeat I&D. Urine
cx, wound cx and 2 out of 4 bcx grew enterobacter cloacae
susceptible to meropenem, gentamicin and cefepime. He was sent
to rehab on IV cefipime and vancomycin, with a plan for for 8
weeks of vancomycin and at least 6 weeks of cefipime. While at
rehab course has been significant for increasing wbc. At d/c his
wbc was 11 and on [**7-24**], wbc was 17.6. He had been afebrile at
rehab, but had been noted to have loose stools. Work-up of
leukocytosis while at rehab included per verbal report a
negative CXR, negative u/a with neg LE and NT and pending U cx
and negative C diff.
.
At [**Hospital **] clinic today, pt noted to have dry mm and also with
purulent drainage from posterior incision site. His BP was 92/60
T 97.5. He was sent to ER for further evaluation of possible
recurrent wound infection.
.
In ER T 96.9, HR 58, 95/53 95% on RA. 95% on RA. He rec'd 2 L NS
woith inecrease of BP to 95/54, and was continued on prior abx
cefipime and flagyl. Pt was seen by ortho who would like c-spine
CT and are planning to take him to OR tomorrow.

[**2115-7-25**] CT T-spine: 1. Horizontal fracture of the superior
endplate of T12, with posterior translation of the fracture
fragment relative to the remainder of the vertebral body into
the central canal. Paired pedicle screws are located within this
displaced fracture fragment, and is displaced along with the
fragment into the central canal.
2. Soft tissue bulging at the site of this fracture, presumed to
represent a hematoma. However, superimposed infection cannot be
excluded.
3. Assessment for an abscess is limited without IV contrast.
.
[**2115-7-25**] CXR: 1. Posterior migration of the two distal set of
pedicle screws compared to CT chest of [**2115-6-6**], with acute
angulation and kyphosis of the thoracic spine at this level,
concerning for unstable hardware.
2. Moderate right pleural effusion with atelectasis.
.
[**2115-7-29**] ECHO: No endocarditis or abscess seen. Normal regional
and global biventricular systolic function. No pathologic
valvular abnormality seen.
.
[**2115-7-31**] EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the slow
background and bursts of generalized slowing. These
abnormalities suggest a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances and infection are among the
most common causes. No lateralized or epileptiform features were
noted.
