Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
66yF with a history of PCKD s/p B nephrectomy and liver cyst
fenestration [**9-11**] s/p LURT on [**2194-4-9**] who presents with acute
onset abdominal pain. Her pain started on [**11-20**] at 9pm 45
minutes
after taking her pm medications. She had reheated meat pie, cake
and ice cream for dinner. Her nausea was followed by nausea and
she had an episode of emesis at 10pm. The pain is in the
epigastrium and wraps around to her back. She has not had this
kind of pain before. The emesis was non-bilious. She had flatus
and a bowel movement after the pain started. There are no
factors
that will relieve or aggravate her pain. Transplant surgery is
consulted for management of abdominal pain in a patient s/p
kidney txp.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Transplant Service and was kept NPO. IV
Unasyn was started. A HIDA scan was done demonstrating no
evidence of cholecystitis.  KUB was unremarkable. She continued
to have abdominal pain. She was given intermittent doses of IV
dilaudid. NG tube was placed. Liver duplex was done to assess
for cholelithiasis. . No cholelithiasis was noted. There was no
extra, or intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The gallbladder
wall had  edema-thickening measuring 3-4 mm.  Abdominal and
pelvic CT with contrast was done noting thickening of the
proximal small bowel in addition to mild dilation with
transition point in the left mid abdomen. There was non-specific
thickening of gastric pyloris wall and unchanged multiple liver
and pancreatic cysts.


On [**11-23**], a CTA of the abd/pevis was done to re-eval for SBO and
to assess for bowel ischemia. Findings were as follows:

Mechanical small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the
left lower
abdomen with configuration of transition point suggesting closed
loop
obstruction possibly due to internal hernia.
2. No major order mesenteric vascular occlusion is seen. The
small bowel
proximal to the level of obstruction is thick walled and
edematous raising the
possibility of venous engorgement versus ischemia related to
obstruction.
3. There is ascites which appears slightly worse to the prior
study.
4. There is mild-to-moderate celiac artery and mild superior
mesenteric
artery ostial stenosis.
5. Note incidentally made of replaced right hepatic artery.
6. Multiple hepatic and pancreatic cysts.
7. Tiny nonspecific hypodensities are seen in the spleen. Unless
there is
clinical concern for opportunistic infection, these are unlikely
to be of
significance. In the setting of immunosuppression, however,
fungal infection
is not excluded.

Given persistent/progressive abdominal pain and CT findings, she
was taken to the OR on [**2194-11-23**]. She underwent exploratory
laparotomy and small-bowel resection, lysis of adhesions for
closed loop obstruction. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please
refer to operative note for details.

Postop, pain was managed with PCA dilaudid. Urine output dropped
postop and IV fluid bolus was given with increased urine output.
She was kept NPO with the NG tube to suction. On postop day 1,
NG output decreased. She tolerated clamping therefore the tube
was removed. Famotidine was given for complaints of dyspepsia.

She had an O2 requirement with desat's to 70s. CXR demonstrated
bilateral small  pleural effusions consistent with volume
overload. She was transferred to the SICU for management and
received IV lasix several times as well as nebs with
improvement. EKG was normal. O2 was weaned. Cardiac echo was
done on [**11-26**]. EF was >55%. There was evidence of chronic
pulmonary hypertension. No RV strain was noted. BNP was
elevated.

She was transferred out of the SICU on [**11-28**] on a face tent with
O2 sats of 95-100%. O2 was weaned.

She did have some nausea that was attributed to dilaudid. Zofran
was given with relief. Diet was  slowly advanced and tolerated.
She was having BMs. PCA was switched to po dilaudid.

Prograf was adjusted per trough levels. Trough was 8.6 at time
of discharge on 1mg [**Hospital1 **].

Physical therapy was consulted and worked with her. She was
declared safe for discharge to home without services. She was
discharged to home without VNA services.
