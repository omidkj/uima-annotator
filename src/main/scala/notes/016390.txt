Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Nortriptyline

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Torsades [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 29185**], EP evaluation, possible ICD placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Insertion of single-chamber pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 y.o. female with history of CHF (EF 10-15%), CAD
(CABG in [**2151**]), transferred from OSH after 2 episodes of
torsades. Because of the language barrier (Russian-speaking
only), poor hearing (unable to hear phone interpreter), and
dementia, most of the history was obtained from her son and the
medical record. She was admitted to [**Hospital6 **]
[**3-10**] with 2 hours of new-onset shortness of breath, diaphoresis,
and palpitations. She denied chest pain initially but at various
times complained of feeling chest heaviness in addition to
difficulty catching her breath. She denied pleuritic pain,
cough, hemoptysis, lower extremity pain or swelling, fevers,
chills, abdominal pain, black or bloody stool, orthopnea, or
PND. She has a known history of CHF, with TTE from [**9-15**] showing
EF of [**9-24**]%. She was transferred to the CCU where she had two
brief episodes of torsades on the morning of [**3-11**]. Her potassium
was 2.9 at 8pm on [**3-10**] and she was repleted. Her potassium at
4am on [**3-11**] was 3.8 and magnesium was 1.8. She had her episodes
of torsades at ~11pm. She was given 2gm IV magnesium, lidocaine
100mg IV followed by a 0.5mg/hr drip.
.
Her son reports that she had in the past voiced opinions about
not having devices such as pacemakers or ICDs implanted.
However, her family wished that she be evaluated at [**Hospital1 18**] and
that this decision may be reconsidered if necessary. She was
transferred on the lidocaine gtt and heparin gtt for afib.

EF 35%
.

.
Other Past History: ***
#. Atrial fibrillation, put on coumadin but stopped for
hemorrhoidal bleeding
#. CVA [**1-10**], presented with left-sided arm numbness and
weakness, symptoms largely resolved, felt to be embolic
secondary to new onset afib
#. Congestive heart failure (mild ischemic) with ejection
fraction of 15 to 20%,
#. NSTEMI in [**9-26**] Adenosine MIBI revealed global
hypokinesis and large
distal/anterior/anteroseptal/apical/inferolateral defects, which
were not reversible. [**2166-11-5**] echocardiogram revealed
anteroseptal/apical/anterolateral akinesis with an ejection
fraction of 15 to 20%, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (no
significant change from [**2166-8-25**] echocardiogram).
#. Hydronephrosis.
#. Dementia for past 1-1.5 years


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.
.
She came to the US in [**2151**]. The patient lives with her husband.
She is Russian speaking. She ambulates on her own.
.


Family History:
There is no known family history of premature coronary artery
disease or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 133/56 mm Hg while supine. Pulse was 68
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 13 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. Orientation could not be assessed. The patient was
sleepy but arousable to voice.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of ~8 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. There were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. There was poor air movement due to
inability to follow commands; within this limitation, the lungs
revealed occasional crackles.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Chest X-ray on [**2170-3-14**]:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is a left pleural
effusion and left retrocardiac opacity.  No right pleural
effusion is seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  A
pacemaker, cardiomegaly, and CABG related changes are stable.

IMPRESSION:  Persistent left pleural effusion and left
retrocardiac opacity likely representing areas of atelectasis
and/or consolidation.  No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
#) CV - Rhythm - Wide-complex tachycardia, likely SVT with
aberrancy. Underlying   sick sinus syndrome. A single-chamber
pacemaker placed, programmed in VVI mode. Started on Amiodarone,
Metoprolol. After discussion with family & PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 13529**] not to
anticoagulate. Avoid QT prolonging medications such as
haloperidol, trazodone.
.
#) Ischemia - No issues during this hospitalization.  Increased
lisinopril, started on metoprolol.
.
#) Pump function - no evidence of CHF. Increased Lisinopril,
started on spironolactone. Will require close outpatient
monitoring of her potassium.  Beta-blocker should be maintained
at low-dose given poor pump function.
.
#) Dementia - Patient was restarted on aricept as bradycardia
less of a concern after pacemaker insertion.
.
#) Code status - Full code per discussion with son
.
#) Communication - son, [**Name (NI) 1959**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 50449**]
