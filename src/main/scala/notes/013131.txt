Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheter


History of Present Illness:
78 yo male with history of HTN (poorly controlled on 4
antihypertensives), HL, CRF stage IV (baseline 3.4, considering
peritoneal dialysis initiation as outpatient) who is being
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for hypertensive urgency and
evaluation for HD initiation. He presented to NWH on [**2119-4-21**] with
one day of increasing nausea and vomiting. On the day of
presentation, he also experienced some nonradiating substernal
chest pressure, which he reports as occuring intermittently for
at least a few months, usually at night, and without any clear
precipitants. He denied orthopnea or PND; lower extremity edema
had been improving with uptitration of diuretics.
.
On presentation to the ED, VS: BP 196/93, P 74, RR 22, O2sat 92
on bipap, 98% on NRB at 15L. Cr was 4.4 (baseline 4), K 4.7,
trop 0.12. CXR showed evidence of pulmonary edema. He was given
NTG paste and admitted to the floor. He also had a left lung
opacity c/w pneumonia and was started on ctx/azithromycin.
However, he subsequently developed chest pain with accompanying
ST depressions in V4-V6 in the setting of SBP in the 170s-180s.
He was given ASA 325mg and NTG SLs with improvement in blood
pressure. He was also started on a heparin gtt and transferred
to the ICU. Troponins peaked at 0.48. He continued to have
intermittent chest pain in the setting of poorly controlled
blood pressure so given IV lopressor and started on a nitro gtt
which was increased up to 100 with SBP ranging 130 to 170s on
this plus metoprolol po (increased 300mg to 400mg), amlodipine
(home dose), hydralazine (increased 100mg tid to qid), and
verapamil (new med - 40 mg q8h, possibly increased to 80mg). TTE
showed LVH, thickened valves without stenosis, mild TR with
preserved EF, no WMA. Renal was consulted to assist with
diuresis as he was diuresing <1L a day on his home torsemide
100mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was given lasix 160mg with metolazone and diuril
and initially put out 100-200c/h. However, UOP began decreasing
to 20-30 cc/h. Given persistent hypertension of renovascular
etiology with concern for ischemic heart disease and volume
management, plan was made to transfer to our ICU for question of
initiating dialysis as well as possible cardiac cath.
.
On the floor, pt currently without chest pain or dyspnea. He has
no complaints.

[**2119-4-24**] Chest X-Ray:
1. Probable resolving left lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Acute pulmonary edema.
.
[**2119-4-25**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2119-4-25**] Chest X-Ray:
1. Worsening pulmonary edema.
2. Worsening right lower lobe pneumonia or aspiration.
.
[**2119-4-26**] Chest X-Ray:
Comparison is made with prior study performed [**4-25**].
Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has minimally improved. There
is less mediastinal widening. Left supraclavicular catheter tip
is in the lower SVC. There is no evident pneumothorax. If any,
there are small bilateral pleural effusions associated with
adjacent atelectasis worse on the left.
.
[**2119-4-27**] Renal Ultrasound with Dopplers
1. Increased cortical echogenicity compatible with the known
chronic renal disease.
2. Multiple simple cysts bilaterally.
3. Technically inadequate Doppler but evidence suggesting poor
vascularization of the left kidney relative to the right. If
there is concern for left renal artery stenosis, further imaging
would be required, as adequate Doppler waveforms could not be
obtained from the left kidney. Limited views from the right side
show relatively normal arterial and venous waveforms.
.
Repeat Renal US with Doppler [**2119-5-1**]
1. No evidence of renal artery stenosis bilaterally.
2. The left kidney is again noted to be somewhat atrophic and
demonstrates
cortical thinning. Simple bilateral renal cysts are again noted.
