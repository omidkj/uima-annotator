Service:  CCU
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post left internal carotid artery
angioplasty and stenting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old woman
with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, carotid
until three months ago, when she developed word-finding
difficulty.  Her carotid Doppler on [**2140-9-28**] showed 80% to
99% stenosis of left carotid artery, and 70% to 79% stenosis
of the right carotid artery.  Otherwise, she denied any focal
deficits, including weakness, numbness, diplopia, dysphasia,
field cuts, or gait difficulty.  She is known to have
stocking-glove numbness and hypesthesia secondary to diabetic

She was admitted on [**2140-9-28**] for a left internal carotid
artery angioplasty and stenting.  Her creatinine on admission
was 2.3.  She was prehydrated with 0.5% normal saline and was
given Mucormyst.  She went for left internal carotid artery
angioplasty and stenting on [**2140-9-29**], the date of transfer
to CCU, without any complications.  She was on dopamine drip
initially due to carotid procedure which induced bradycardia
and no hypotension.  She was transferred to CCU for close
monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Carotid disease:  Left internal carotid and right carotid
artery stenosis.  For details, see carotid Doppler.
2.  Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG in [**2133**],
status post PTCA of LIMA in [**2136**].
3.  Chronic anemia:  Iron deficiency.
4.  Small ASD by echo in [**2133**].
5.  History of TIA and CVA in [**2133**].  Aspirin and Plavix
since.
6.  Post-stroke seizure in [**2133**].
7.  Diabetes with peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy and
nephropathy. HbA1C in [**2139-10-15**] was 7.4.
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency, creatinine ranging from 1.6
to 2.0.
9.  Cervical spondylosis, C4-C5, C5-C6, T8-T9, L5-S1.
10. Left chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy.
11. Hypertension.
12. Hypercholesterolemia.
13. Status post bilateral cataract surgery.
14. Status post left upper extremity fracture repair.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg q.d.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
4.  Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d.
5.  Imdur 30 mg b.i.d.
6.  Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d.
7.  Zyprexa 2.5 mg q.h.s.
8.  Atenolol 25 mg q.d.
9.  Iron sulfate 325 mg q.d.
10. Depakote 250 mg q.h.s.
11. Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.
12. Calcium 600 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for CVA.  Father passed away in car
accident.  Mother passed away from colon cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol.  Lives with husband at
home.  Ambulates with cane for a short distance, wheelchair
for a long distance.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO CCU:  Temperature 96.2??????,
heart rate 85, blood pressure 116/44, O2 sat 91% to 93% on
room air, 96% to 100% with 4 liters by nasal cannula.
General:  Lying in bed in no acute distress.  Head and neck:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx clear.  Soft left
carotid bruit.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2.  S3
present.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally
anteriorly.  Abdomen soft, obese, nondistended, nontender.
Extremities:  No pitting edema.  Bilateral distal pulses.
Right groin has small ecchymosis, no bruit, slightly tender.
Neuro:  Awake, alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II - XII
grossly intact.  Sensory decreased in bilateral lower
extremities.  Strength 4+ to [**4-17**] bilaterally.  Nonfocal exam.

LABORATORY:  White count of 8.8, hematocrit 27.7 which is
down from 31.1 pre-procedure, platelets 242, sodium 136,
potassium 4.4, chloride 101, BUN 87, creatinine 1.7, glucose
189, calcium 11.3, mag 2.4, phos 4.6.

She had a head MRI without contrast on [**2140-9-28**], no acute
infarct, advanced chronic microvascular ischemic changes
involving deep central white matter, 70% stenosis
precavernous and cavernous portion of the left internal
carotid artery, less than 30% stenosis of the mid-basilar
artery.  Significant carotid stenosis by Doppler.  Left
carotid 90% to 99%.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient remained stable during the
hospital stay.  She was off dopamine soon in CCU.  She was
transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit of 24.6 post-procedure and her hematocrit has
remained stable since.  She was restarted on all her home
medications on hospital day #2.  She was scheduled for
discharge the next day.  However, on hospital day #3, she was
found to have a soft bruit at her right groin site.  An
ultrasound revealed a 2.6 cm pseudoaneurysm just superior and
medial to the puncture site.  Therefore, she stayed in the
hospital awaiting IR to perform ultrasound-guided thrombin
injection.  After physical therapy evaluation, rehab was
recommended, given the patient's poor functional status.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Rehab facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Carotid disease, status post left internal carotid artery
stent.
2.  Right femoral pseudoaneurysm, status post thrombin
injection.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Diabetes.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Furosemide 20 mg b.i.d.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg q.d.

5.  Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
6.  Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d.
7.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg b.i.d.
8.  Potassium acetate 2 tablets t.i.d.
9.  Iron sulfate 325 mg q.d.
