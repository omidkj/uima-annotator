Admission Date:  [**2134-3-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2134-4-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2069-5-26**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Weakness and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year-old
female who back in [**2128**] had developed a sudden onset of pain
in her neck.  She was evaluated by her primary care physician
and was sent for an exercise tolerance test and the patient
had an myocardial infarction and developed congestive heart
failure.  She was started on medications and did well until
[**2129-3-9**] when she again had an episode of shortness of breath.
At this time she underwent a catheterization and angioplasty
and stent placement of her right coronary artery.  She has
done well since then and recently in [**2134**] she had increasing
of shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and had an
exercise tolerance test, which was positive.  The ischemia
though occurred much quicker and she underwent cardiac
catheterization again, which showed coronary artery disease.
Catheterization results were left anterior descending
coronary artery 60 to 70% stenosis, left circumflex 80%
stenosis and right coronary artery 60 to 70% stenosis.  She
now presents to [**Hospital1 69**] for
coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, obesity,
congestive heart failure, insulin dependent diabetes times
twenty years and endometrial cancer recently diagnosed.  She
had recent vaginal bleeding and was evaluated by her Ob/Gyn
physician and found to have endometrial cancer.  She will be
treated at [**Hospital3 3834**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41922**], phone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 41923**] after her coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for status post
appendectomy, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
status post open reduction and internal fixation of right
lower extremity secondary to trauma.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Ativan 1 mg po b.i.d., Isosorbide
90 mg po b.i.d., Zantac 150 mg po b.i.d. prn, Atenolol 25 mg
po b.i.d., Cardizem CD 120 mg po b.i.d., Lescol 40 mg q.h.s.,
Aldactone 25 mg po q.d., Lasix 80 mg po q.d., Nitropatch 0.6
transdermal daily, nitroglycerin sublingual as needed.  She
takes insulin 30 of NPH plus 12 of regular in the morning, 17
of regular for dinner and 16 of NPH at bedtime.

ALLERGIES:  Percocet, which causes nausea and vomiting and
Vioxx, which causes a gastrointestinal upset.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a retired teacher.  She lives alone.
She has no tobacco or ETOH history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is an obese white female
in no acute distress.  Her weight is 113 kilograms.  Blood
pressure is 168/91.  Skin is within normal limits.  Pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light.  Oropharynx is clear.
Neck she has no bruits.  No evidence of jugulovenous
distention.  Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and obese.  She had no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities.  The patient
is alert and oriented times three.  She has 1+ distal pulses
bilaterally.

Her electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm with a rate of
60 with a normal axis.  No evidence of ischemia, though she
has a history of atrial fibrillation.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.4,
hematocrit 38.4, platelets 343, PT 12.4, PTT 21.6, INR of
1.1.  She has a sodium of 142, potassium 4.5, chloride 96,
bicarbonate of 30, BUN of 31, creatinine 1.2, glucose 184,
AST 21 and LDH of 268.  Her preop PA and lateral showed no
evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient on the day of admission went to
the Operating Room and underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft times three off pump.  She had a left internal mammary
coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein
graft to posterior descending coronary artery.  She was
transferred to the Recovery Room with a mean arterial
pressure of 65, CVP of 22 in normal sinus rhythm with a rate
of 53 on Propofol at 30 micrograms per kilogram per minute,
neo 0.5 micrograms per kilogram per minute, insulin at 1.

Postoperatively in the Intensive Care Unit she required
multiple boluses, but remained hemodynamically stable.  She
was also given some _________ ______ 500 cc.  She remained on
neo, which was weaned and remained with a cardiac output of
greater then 4 with a cardiac index of around approximately
2.  She was extubated in the evening of the first
postoperative night, which she tolerated well.  Chest tubes
remained in 20 cm of water.  She was also continued on an
insulin drip overnight.  She remained stable the next morning
and was transferred to the floor for the remainder of her
recovery.  On postoperative day number two her JP chest tube
and wires were discontinued.  On postoperative day number
three she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response.  She was given Lopressor po.  Her
electrolytes were repleted.  Her blood pressure remained
stable in the 120s, 140s/70s.  She was loaded with
Amiodarone.  She then on postoperative day number three again
had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.  Her blood
pressure remained stable at 138/75.  She was given Amiodarone
and Lopressor and her rate responded appropriately.

She was started on Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.
Currently her INR is 2.5.  She remains in sinus rhythm.  On
postoperative day number 7 after beginning anticoagulation
the patient developed some vaginal spotting.  Given her
history of endometrial cancer, a Gyn consult was obtained.
Their evaluation was that the bleeding was stable.  There was
no need to proceed to hysterectomy at this time.  They
suggested the patient be continued on anticoagulation and
will be followed up by her Gyn in six months and that her
condition is likely stable.  The patient's anticoagulation
was continued.  She is therapeutic.  She remained in sinus
rhythm.  During this time she is also been evaluated by
physical therapy.  She is currently at a level activity of 3.
She has remained hemodynamically stable and is now ready for
discharge to rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times three off
pump.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Insulin dependent diabetes times twenty years.
5.  Endometrial cancer.
6.  Postoperative onset of atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone 400 mg po q.d., Colace 100
mg po b.i.d., Zantac 150 mg po b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg po q.d.,
Lopressor 75 mg po b.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d., Lescol 40
mg po q.h.s., Darvocet one to two tabs po q 4 hours prn,
Albuterol MDI two puffs q 4 hours prn, Tylenol 650 po pr q 6

sliding scale as well.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
