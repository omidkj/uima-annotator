History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 76 yo patient with PMH of CAD s/p DES to prox
and mid LAD ([**2174-3-10**]), nephrolithiasis s/p stent, DM2, CVA and
likely dementia who presents on transfer from [**Hospital3 18201**] with MRSA bacteremia and MS changes.  Pt
originally presented to OSH with weakness and near syncope in
the setting of dysuria, urgency and frequency complaints as well
as mental status changes and disorientation.  Pt admitted with
UTI and started on Levaquin.  Workup included UCx which grew
Klebsiella (ampicillin resistant) and [**4-18**] BCx that grew MRSA.
Pt started on Vancomycin with addition of Gentamicin for
synergy.  MRSA bacteremia without clear source; endocarditis
considered but no documented echocardiogram.  Additional
complaints include abdominal tenderness, distension and G+
stool, as well as painful right knee without effusion.  Pt was
noted to have a Hct of 24 5 days ago and was transfused 2u
PRBCs, given G+ stool Pt was placed on protonix.  On
presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], Pt disoriented and unable to clearly
express complaints.  Pt with cries of pain with all palpation

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo female with h.o DM2, mild dementia, CVA and CAD s/p stents
to LAD ([**2174-3-10**]) presenting to OSH with UTI found to have MRSA
bacteremia.

MRSA ENDODCARDITIS: TEE on [**3-27**] with large mobile vegetation on
posterior leaflet and moderate eccentric MR with no PV flow
reversal. No abscess seen and nl LVEF-- while on amrinone. It
was felt she would need right groin hematoma removed as well as
may be source of continued bacteremia. CT surgery plans for MVR
on hold per family discussion, which would be after many weeks
of antibiotics.

VASCULAR: On arrival to MICU noted to have no dopplerable or
palpable right DP/PT pulses and seen by vascular and stat
ultrasound showed occlusive clot of right common femoral artery.
She went for stat CT angio of her LEs- with right hematoma,
segmental occlusion of CFA, severe disease of superficial
femoral, patent popliteal and three vessel flow. She was started
on heparin empirically.

GIB: Pt had BM's with mutliple bright red blots. Repeat Hct 27
down from 33 on admission. SBP in 90's when had been in 110's
130's and had received her regular metoprolol and diltiazem
dose. Was on asa, plavix. Heparin held and bolused 1L NS and
recieved 4uPRBC. Colonscopy prior to vascular surgery difficult
given pressor requirement and underlying cardiac disease.

CARDIOGENIC SHOCK: thought secondary to diastolic dysfunction
and moderate MR(2+) with large mobile vegetation and bilateral
pulm edema. She was intubated, and PA catheter in place with
initial low CO/CI and high SVR which improved on amrinone. [**3-27**]
started on dobutamine; required levophed for pressure support.

COMFORT CARE: It was felt that the patient had an extremely poor
prognosis given her complicated medical history. After lengthy
discussions with member of the MICU team and patients family, it
was decided that we should change to confort care. She was
extubated and pressors were discontinued. At 7pm on [**2174-3-29**] she
was pronounced dead. Immediate cause of death was respiratory
failure, with underlying cause of death endocarditis and
bacteremia. The family was notified, and the attending Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 26687**] was notified.
