Brief Hospital Course:
85-year-old female with CHF, CAD, AFib, MVR on warfarin with
nausea/vomiting x1 and large hematocrit drop of unclear
etiology.
.
# Low hematocrit: large hematocrit drop from baseline 33 last in
[**Month (only) **] to 18 on presentation.  She denied frank hematemesis or
BRBPR on time of presentation and she was guiac negative.  NGT
lavage was done, initially negative, then returned BRB, cleared
with 800cc of fluid.  INR on presentation was 5.4.  SBPs at this
time came down to 90s, from 110s.  CT Scan showed no evidence of
RP bleed.  Patient was started on IV PPI gtt and admitted to the
MICU.  On arrival to the unit, she was given 2L NS and 2 units
PRBCs. Hcts were then stable at 27-29 for remainder of
admission.  GI was consulted, and patient refused inpatient
EGD/colonoscopy.  She was extensively described the benefits of
these studies in her setting and was made aware of the risks of
not doing these studies, yet still refused.  It was determined
that she will get a virtual colonoscopy as an outpatient, and
possibly an Upper GI series.  She was discharged on PO BID PPI
and with GI follow-up.
.
# Mitral valve disease s/p mechanical MV replacement:
supratherapeutic INR on admission > 5. Coumadin restarted at 3
mg once a day when INR returned < 3.  INR 1.9, will be bridged
on Loveox injections once a day until INR > 2.5.
.
# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline creatinine
1.5-1.6. Was elevated to > 2, now back to baseline at time of
discharge, like pre-renal etiology from hypovolemia.
.
# Chronic congestive heart failure: DOE and pulmonary edema on
CXR, based on patient's symptoms at baseline, likely Stage III.
Now back on metoprolol, aspirin, olmesartan.  Will continue to
hold lasix until tomorrow AM as patient not clinically
decompensating currently.
.
#. Hypernatremia: Na maxed out at 151.  Likely secondary to
decreased PO intake as patient had been NPO for several days.
She has started a full diet since.  She was given 1 L D5W, Na
returned to 143 the next day, and remained normal for rest of
admission.
.
# Leg swelling: Appears chronic. R>L. LENI in EW. Negative for
DVT. Chronic venous stasis dermatitis seems stable.
.
# DM2: Insulin sliding scale while renal function unstable.
Outpatient regimen of glipizide started today.
