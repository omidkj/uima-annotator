Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hypopharyngeal mass biopsy
Tracheostomy


History of Present Illness:
74M esophogeal adenocarcinoma in situ (no nodes) s/p
esophagogastrectomy and feeding jejonostomy [**8-25**] (c/b
pseudomonal pna, and trach [**9-25**]) admitted from OSH with 24 hrs
of worsening SOB, productive cough and stridor. Patient has had
progressively worsening stridor and dysphagia - evaluated in [**Hospital **]
clinic ([**Hospital 64107**]) in [**Month (only) 547**] and sent for CT of neck [**4-3**] that
showed a large soft tissue neck mass.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was hypoxic requiring 3L NC; WBC 12.3 with a L shift
and had a CXR showing RML PNA.  At that time, treated with
flagyl, cefepime, levaquin, dexamethasone. ENT saw pt in ED and
on laryngoscope he had diffuse edema of B/L vocal cords but not
epiglottitis with marked airway narrowing. He was intubated for
respiratory distress/airway protection.
.
At NH had been noted to have increasing lethargy, confusion on
[**4-8**] with increasing cream colored sputum. Pt denied
CP/n/v/constipation/ diarrhea.
.
During his MICU course, he was followed closely by ENT and
thoracic surgery regarding this large soft tissue neck mass.  It
was unclear if it was recurrence of his cancer or a complication
of his surgery several months ago.  Underwent rigid bronchoscopy
and biopsy [**4-10**] to obtain tissue of this mass, which showed
squamous mucosa with fibrosis and perivascular acute and chronic
inflammation, no malignancy identified.  Also had EGD at the
same time, which showed a widely patent anastomosis, no masses,
multiple gastric polyps.  Had CT chest to assess of new lymph
nodes/metastatic disease, which showed CHF/new ascites, but no
metastases, LAD.  Did show partial mass as seen on CT from [**4-3**].

.
On [**4-13**], went to OR again for tracheostomy, direct
laryngoscopy/biopsy of hypopharyngeal mass as it was felt they
did not get enough tissue the first time, pathology still
pending.  Had multiple episodes of hypotension, decreased UOP.
Underwent echo which showed new decreased EF 30-35%, moderately
dilated LA/moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with HK of
basal wall.  Mild 1(+) MR/AR. Moderate pulmonary HTN.
.
Was treated with 7 day course zosyn for pneumonia.  Has afib,
anticoagulation held given multiple procedures, now restarted on
warfarin.  Evaluated by cardiology given new echo findings/WMA;
needs cardiac work up including stress mibi once acute medical
issues are resolved.  Now transferred to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 74M esophageal adenocarcinoma admitted with SOB, stridor
found to have new hypopharngeal mass, now s/p tracheostomy for
airway protection.
.
Hospital course is as per the HPI.
.
To summarize:
.
1. Hypopharyngeal mass/tracheostomy-At this point, the etiology
is still not clear.  Had an initial biopsy which did not show
evidence of malignancy.  Given the rapid growing nature of the
mass and his h/o esophageal adenocarcinoma, malignancy was high
on the differential.  He underwent a second biopsy for more
tissue in hopes of a more definitive diagnosis; however, the
pathology also did not show malignancy.  He had a tracheostomy
placed during his second biopsy as there was concern of the mass
compromising his airway.  The patient will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 64107**] of ENT at which time they will discuss how to treat the
mass and how long he will need to have his trach.
.
2. Cardiomyopathy-Patient has a h/o HOCM and now new (since
[**2114**]) decreased EF 30-35% with LV HK, etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **]
further cardiac work up (wtih stress mibi) once acute issues are
resolved.  He was continued on ASA 81 mg po qd, captopril 25 mg
po TID, lopressor 25 mg po bid and digoxin 0.125 mg po qd as
well as atorvastatin 10 mg po qd for h/o hypercholesterolemia.
.
3.  Patient has a h/o atrial fibrillation-His coumadin was held
for all his biopsies, but was restarted after consultation with
ENT.  He needs to have daily INRs checked until he is
therapeutic on his coumadin, with goal INR [**12-26**].  Please adjust
his dose accordingly.
.
4. Anemia-Patient appears to have an Fe deficiency anemia, and
would benefit from iron therapy.  He was started on iron sulfate
and was given one unit pRBC transfusion.  He should discuss age
appropriate cancer screening including colonoscopy with his PCP.
.
5. FEN-J tube feedings for now.  Video swallow exam showed
aspiration after swallowing thick and thin liquids.  Although
nutrition felt he could take a PO diet with special precautions,
ENT did not feel patient should eat because he is aspirating.
PO meds should be crushed via his J tube.  Continue current J
tube feedings.
.
6. OF NOTE, patient does not have h/o hypothyroidism prior to
his recent hospitalizations.  Was evidently placed on levoxyl
prior to admission at rehab.  Was not on levoxyl during his
hospitalization.  His TSH was checked and was WNL.  Needs to
have his TSH checked after his acute medical issues are
resolved.
.
7. Trach care-Patient currently has a cuffed tracheostomy (to
help prevent aspiration, as he is aspirating per swallow study).
 He should have a repeat swallow study in 2 weeks.  If at that
time he is not aspirating, he can be switched to a non-cuffed
tracheostomy.  He can continue with PMV trials as tolerated.
The tracheostomy cuff should be taken down when he has these
trials.  Trach skin care as per usual regimen.
