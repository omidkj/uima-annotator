CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right first toe gangrene.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old gentleman,
with type 2 diabetes, known coronary artery disease with
myocardial infarction, status post coronary artery bypass
grafting in [**2182-7-25**], with a history of congestive
heart failure and atrial fibrillation, with questionable
chronic renal insufficiency, who has had a right first toe
wound since [**Month (only) 359**] of this year which occurred
postoperatively. The patient is referred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
Hospital for further management of his toe gangrene. The
right first toe gangrene started as a blister secondary to an
ill-fitting shoe. This was initially noted in [**Month (only) 359**] of this
year after discharge from rehab. He initially noted right
heel pain, but not toe pain, since the patient is a diabetic
with neuropathy. The patient was referred to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
Wound Center. The wound progressed to right foot heel pain
and cellulitis. He denies any constitutional symptoms.
Initially, the patient was treated with Augmentin and
hospitalized at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**9-23**] with IV
antibiotics of vancomycin and imipenem. The right foot
culture grew out levofloxacin, Unasyn resistant Serratia and
E. coli. During the hospitalization, the patient's INR was
elevated to 10.1. The Coumadin was held. Vitamin K was given.
The patient had episodes of hypoglycemia requiring the Amaryl
to be discontinued. The Zestril and Lasix were held because
of a creatinine of 1.9. The patient is now here for
definitive treatment.

DRUG ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Include vancomycin 750 mg q. 24 h,
imipenem 750 mg q. 8 h., OxyContin 10 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81
mg daily, sotalol 80 b.i.d., Zestril 10 mg daily, Lipitor 10
mg once daily, digoxin 0.25 daily, Amaryl 4 mg--which was
held and discontinued, Lasix 120 mg daily, Coumadin 4 mg
alternating with 2 mg every other day which is held, Percocet
p.r.n. for pain.

ILLNESSES:  Include type 2 diabetes with neuropathy,
hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease with silent
myocardial infarction, a history of congestive heart failure
in [**2182-7-25**], compensated, with an ejection fraction of
22%, a history of atrial fibrillation, a history of chronic
renal insufficiency--baseline creatinine 1.9, a history of
cerebrovascular accident, a history of peripheral vascular
disease by exam.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery bypasses x5 in
[**2182-8-24**] and appendectomy--remote.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired policeman. He is a former,
[**11-25**]-pack per day x30 years. He has not smoked for 2 years.
Alcohol--occasional beer.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  VITAL SIGNS: 98.3, 62, 24, blood pressure
150/80, oxygen saturation 95% on 3 liters, fasting glucose
was 180. GENERAL APPEARANCE: Alert, cooperative white male in
no acute distress. LUNGS: Revealed bilateral crackles. Heart
is a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2.
Abdominal exam is soft, nontender, nondistended. A small
hematoma just above the right groin line. The patient has
bilateral chronic venous stasis changes and pitting edema to
the knees. The right foot shows erythema to the ankles with a
bullous lesion on the dorsal aspect of the foot and an open
lesion to the right heel, and the first right toe is with a
gangrenous tip. Pulse exam shows palpable radials, 1+
femorals and popliteals are 1+ bilaterally. The right DP is
absent. The PT is a monophasic dopplerable signal. On the
left, the DP is a triphasic dopplerable signal, and the PT is
a monophasic dopplerable signal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. Admitting labs included a white count of 10.9, with
neutrophils of 75, hematocrit was 35.0, platelets 293,000,
INR was 3.1, BUN 52, creatinine 1.9, AST 21, ALT 40, alkaline
phosphatase 116, total bilirubin 1.0, digoxin level was 1.6,
total cholesterol was 94, total glycerides were 82, HDL was
34, LDL was 43, hemoglobin A1C was 5.6, vancomycin trough was
11. His cultures on the right toe grew Serratia marcescens
and E. coli. The Serratia was sensitive to Unasyn, resistant
to levofloxacin. The E. coli was sensitive to imipenem,
Zosyn. The patient was continued on vancomycin and Zosyn. His
renal function was monitored.

Cardiology requested to see the patient in anticipation for
potential revascularization and perioperative risk
assessment. Because of patient's recent revascularization,
they felt that the patient was at no increased cardiac risk
and was safe to proceed with any planned surgical
intervention. His aspirin was restarted, and his ACE
inhibitor was restarted when the renal function was at
baseline. He was continued on his sotalol. Recommendations
were to check the LDL and increase the atorvastatin if the
LDL was greater than 70 to 20 mg a day. Lasix should be
restarted 80 mg a day.

The patient underwent diagnostic arteriogram by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**2182-10-1**] via the left femoral artery. The study
demonstrated the abdominal aorta was patent but ectatic on
the infrarenal aorta with single renal arteries bilaterally.
There was a focal stenosis of the proximal left renal artery.
There was brisk filling of the nephrograms, and a patent
bilateral common iliac, external and internal iliac arteries.
The right lower extremity runoff showed a patent common
femoral, profunda femoris and SFA. There was a 3-cm occlusion
at the [**Doctor Last Name **] canal. There was reconstruction of the AK [**Doctor Last Name **]
via the profunda collaterals. The BK [**Doctor Last Name **] has a focal 80-99%
in the distal portion. The AT is occluded. The PT is
occluded. Tibioperoneal trunk shows 50% focal stenosis. The
peroneal is patent to the ankle, and the collaterals
reconstitute the distal PT at the ankle. The is PT runoff
into the plantars. There is reconstruction of a very small
DP. The patient was reversed with FFP prior to sheath
removal. The patient tolerated the arteriogram, and continued
on IV hydration, gentle, with acetylcholine pre and post
angio.

The patient had vein mapping done to assess for appropriate
conduit. The patient underwent on [**2182-10-3**] a right
fem-peroneal bypass with nonreversed greater saphenous vein,
angioscopy and valve lysis. He tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. He
continued to do well from a hemodynamic standpoint and was
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.

Postoperative day 1, there were no overnight events. The
patient remained in the VICU. He was transfused 1 unit of red
blood cells for a hematocrit of 27.1 with a post-transfusion
hematocrit of 26.8. At the time of transfer to rehab, his
hematocrit was 31.0.

Postoperative day 2, the patient continued on his vancomycin
and Zosyn. There were no overnight events. His T-max was
100.2-99.3. His exam was unremarkable. The foot was well-
perfused, pink and warm, and he had a dopplerable AT on the
right, with dopplerable pedal pulses on the left. Diuresis
was continued, and the patient's diet was advanced as
tolerated. He was converted to oral medications. Goal for
diuresis was less than 1500-cc. Ambulation was begun.

Postoperative day 3, Swan was discontinued. Diuresis was
continued. He otherwise was doing well. Swan catheter was
converted to CVL which was placed without complication and a
negative chest x-ray for pneumothorax.

Postoperative day 4, the patient continued to progress. He
continued to run a low-grade temp of 99.4-97.6. His diuresis
was continued. PT saw the patient and assessed plans for
discharge planning. They felt that he would benefit from
rehab when medically stable to be discharged to rehab.

Postoperative day 5, the patient was continued on his
Coumadin for his history of atrial fibrillation and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for a goal INR of 2.0-3.0. Ace
