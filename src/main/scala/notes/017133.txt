Chief Complaint:
Acute blood loss anemia, hypoxia, lethargy


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 85 yo W with PMH of HTN, COPD and recent hip fracture
s/p R hip pinning here with anemia and worsening lethargy. Has
been in USOH at rehab until  Since that time has not had a BM.
Her son noted a significant decline in overall status with
worsening lethargy and disorientation in last 4 days. Denied CP,
fevers, chills, cough. Does note some urinary frequency but no
dysuria or hematuria. At rehab she was found to be acutely SOB
and hypoxic.  She was sent to [**Location (un) 620**] ED for further evaluation.
Of note, she was started on lovenox 3 weeks prior in setting of
hip surgery.

At [**Location (un) 620**], VS 100.5 HR75 BP 119/63 RR21 100NRB. PT was found to
have HCT of 17. Plts of 1035. CXR showed airspace opacities with
mild evidence of CHF. BNP was [**Numeric Identifier **]. She received lasix 20mg IV
for presumed pulmonary edema. She had a +UA and received
levaquin 750mg IV x1. Rectal exam with heme positive black
stool. NG lavage at OSH was negative for blood. Also noted to
have TN T 0.133 with negative CK and no EKG changes. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for further management.

In the ED, VS: T98 BP123/51 HR 87 16 99% on 1L. Repeat labs
revealed HCT 20, Plts 1163. UA + with 21-50 WBCs. Tn 0.17. 2
large bore IVs were placed and she was type and crossmatched.
She was started on 1st unit of blood. Bcx and urine cx were sent
in ED. She was transferred to the MICU for further management.

On arrival to the MICU, pt is stable, accompanied by Son, HCP.
She denies CP, SOB, abdominal pain/n/v/d. Does report decreased
appetite and recent poor PO intake.

.
IMAGING: CXR (OSH) cephalization; blunting of left costophrenic
angle; no clear inflitrates

CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Bibasilar areas of consolidation are concerning for
superimposed
infection.
2. A non-relaxed gallbladder containing stones, however, there
is no
pericholecystic fluid or peri-gallbladder fat stranding,
however, in the
appropriate clinical setting cholecystitis may be present.
3. Complex appearing right adnexal mass for which a pelvic
ultrasound on a
non-emergent basis is recommended.
4. Hypodensity in the spleen, which may represent a hemangioma,
abscess or
metastasis but is not fully assessed. Would recommend further
evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT or abdominal ultrasound.
5. Extensive atherosclerotic vascular calcifications with a
femoral-femoral bypass graft.
6. No retroperitoneal hemorrhage or other hematoma

Video Swallow Study:
Aspiration on nectar consistency, penetration with honey-thick
consistencies.

CT Head w/o contrast:
1. No definite evidence of acute major vascular territorial
infarction.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive given the extensive white
matter
changes and lack of priors which limits assessment for small
acute infarcts.
2. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic changes and global
volume loss.

MRI/MRA head:
1. Left vertebral artery aneursym, largely thrombosed, with a
small central patent component. There is extensive edema within
the medulla some flow anteriorly. The findings suggest a large
partially thrombosed left vertebral artery aneurysm which has
invaginated into the medulla.
2. Punctate embolic infarcts, predominantly within the posterior
circulation distribution.
3. A 2 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

CTA head/neck:
1. Large aneurysm arising from the left vertebral artery, either
at the
origin of the left PICA or just superior to the origin of the
left PICA.
2. A 2-mm ACOM and right A1/A2 junction aneurysm.
3. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
4. Lung nodules measuring greater than 1 cm in diameter,
concerning for
neoplastic process. Small left pleural effusion. Dedicated chest
CT is
recommended to further evaluate the above findings.
5. Multiple pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
6. Multiple hypodense and partially calcified nodules in thyroid
gland.
7. Emphysematous changes.

Pelvic ultrasound:
Complex cystic mass lesion in the right adnexa, containing
internal septations and a mural nodule, concerning for a cystic
neoplasm. Further evaluation of this lesion would require
surgery.

CXR: Bilateral lower lobe collapse, left greater than right with
left
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old female with history of recent hip fracture, HTN,
COPD, thrombocytosis who presented with SOB, fever, UTI and
anemia.  She was originally admitted to the MICU and then
transferred to the floor with a diagnosis of anemia, pneumonia,
and UTI.  She was later found to have a large vertebral artery
aneurysm, an ovarian mass, and multiple lung nodules concerning
for metastatic cancer.

#. Ovarian mass and lung nodules: Upon admission to the
hospital, she had a CT abdomen/pelvis which showed an adnexal
mass which was not well characterized.  She had a follow-up
pelvic ultrasound which demonstrated a large cystic adnexal mass
concerning for cystic neoplasm.  Gynecology-oncology was
consulted who was concerned that this was ovarian cancer.  The
next step in diagnosis would be exploratory laparotomy.
However, given the patient's poor respiratory and functional
status, surgery was not recommended.  She was also found to have
multiple lung nodules concerning for metastatic disease, as well
as a pleural effusion and pathologically enlarged mediastinal
lymph nodes.  It is unclear whether the lung nodules are related
to a primary ovarian, lung, or other type of cancer, or whether
these are related to her ovarian mass.  Given these findings,
multiple family meetings were held, and per the patient's and
family's wishes, palliative care was chosen as the best option.
She was discharged on hospice with focus on comfort measures.

#. Dysphagia: Throughout her hospitalization, she had difficulty
swallowing.  This progressed to the point where she couldn't eat
or drink anything without aspirating and going into respiratory
distress with hypoxia requiring a face mask.  She had a video
swallow study which showed that she aspirated both liquids and
solids.  She was then kept NPO and was evaluated for causes of
dysphagia.  During this workup, she was found to have the above
adnexal mass and lung nodules concerning for metastatic disease.
 Given her prognosis, the family and patient decided not to
pursue other means of nutrition such as a PEG tube or TPN.  At
discharge, the patient denies feeling hungry or thirsty and is
taking no oral intake.
