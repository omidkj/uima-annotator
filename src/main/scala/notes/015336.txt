History of Present Illness:
On admission:
72 year old female with CAD, CHF, COPD presenting with altered
mental status, hypoxia and fever. Recurrent admissions for
hypercarbic resp failure and PNA. last admission early late
[**Month (only) **]/early [**Month (only) 956**], and has been home from rehab x approx 3
weeks.
.
On the day of admission, the patient was noted to be more
lethargic than usual by her health aide, afebrile, no cough. Per
daughter, using nasal bipap at night, NC oxygen 3.5L all day
(baseline sats 86-92%). By report, not her self yesterday,
walking with walker and slumped to ground witnessed, no head
strike. Today more lethargic. Pt presented to the ED initially
afebrile, but later spiked to 102.8. She received CTX 1 g and

.
Upon arrival to the MICU, pt was somnolent, on CPAP, no
complaints via daughter who interprets for her.

CXR ([**4-9**]): Markedly limited study due to motion artifact.
[**Month/Year (2) **] left basilar atelectasis, cardiomegaly, prominent
hilar vessels. Recommend repeat radiograph for further
evaluation if needed
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP and lateral chest compared to [**4-9**]: Severe
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has worsened consistent
with progressive cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary vascular congestion is moderate, not appreciably
changed since [**4-9**] and mediastinal
veins are only mildly dilated. No appreciable pleural effusion
is present and there is no consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead is
continuous from the left axillary pacemaker.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2132-3-5**], LV systolic funciton has improved. If clinically
indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast (Definity) may aid
in a more accurate assessment of regional and global LV
function.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
She was initially admitted to the medical ICU due to hypoxia and
an increased oxygen requirement in the ED. Sedating medications
were held due to her sedation and lethargy, and she was given
steroids and started on antibiotics (vancomycin/Zosyn/Levaquin)
for a possible healthcare associated pneumonia and COPD
exacerbation, since she was at risk due to her underlying
pulmonary status and recent prolonged stay in a rehabilitation
facility. She was placed on CPAP overnight. The following day,
her oxygenation had improved, as had her sedation/lethargy.
However, she became quite agitated; this was thought to be due
to having had her usual anti-psychotic medications held, as well
as the administration of steroids. At that time, she was deemed
medically stable for transfer to the regular Medicine floor.
.
.
Hospital Course:
*)Fever/hypoxia - initial CXR was sub-optimal due to her body
habitus and movement during the exam. Repeat imaging showed a
possible retrocardiac infiltrate vs. increased pulmonary
congestion. As she remained afebrile during her hospital course,
antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin only, and she had
completed an 8-day course prior to discharge.
.
*)Altered mental status - likely related to fever, dehydration,
and a possible shift in acid-base balance due to recently added
medications (diuretics). Mental status improved with CPAP and
improved oxygenation. Recently added medications were initially
held, although furosemide was later re-started at a lower dose
once her mental status had improved and stabilized.
.
*)COPD/OSA - she is a chronic CO2 retainer, but her oxygenation
improved after maintenance with CPAP at night and supplemental
oxygen during the day. On discharge she was maintaining her
baseline oxygen saturation on her usual level of supplemental
oxygen.
.
*)CHF - diuretics were initially held due to concern that a
derangement of her acid/base balance was contributing to her
altered mental status. A later CXR was concerning for possible
increase in fluid, and as her mental status had normalized, she
was re-started on furosemide at a lower dose than prior, which
she tolerated well. An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate
possibly increased cardiomegaly on CXR, and showed improved
function from her prior echo.
.
*)ARF - creatinine on admission was 1.3, which normalized to her
baseline of 1.0 after gentle IV fluids in the ICU. This was
likely due to pre-renal azotemia/dehydration in the setting of
infection.
.
*)Schizophrenia - after recovery of her mental status, was
initially quite agitated, with an increase in paranoid
delusions. Was re-started on the anti-psychotic medications that
had been held due to her sedation. Over the following few days,
her agitation decreased and on discharge she was at her
baseline. This was confirmed by her daughter, who was a daily
visitor. [**Name (NI) **] medication regimen was discussed with her
outpatient psychiatrist, and he will follow up with her.
.
*)CAD - she had one episode of chest pain during her
hospitalization, but based on her symptoms and the physical exam
at that time (with tenderness to palpation over the chest wall)
this was thought to be more
