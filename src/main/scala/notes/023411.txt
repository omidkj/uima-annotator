respiratory distress

History of Present Illness:
70 yo F with COPD, found after a fall by her group home aide
this morning. She was tachypneic and given a nebulizer. 911 was
then called. EMS found the patient to be mottled and in severe
respiratory distress, so she was intubated in the field. Group
home staff notes that she had a sore throat and difficulty
swallowing since yesterday.

In the ED, initial vitals were SBP 110s then became hypotensive
to the 60s. She received 3.5L of normal saline. She was given
vancomycin and zosyn, then started on peripheral levophed. A
right IJ was placed in the ED but CXR showed it coiled in the
neck so it was removed.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were BP 100/70, HR 112, O2
93%. She was on assist control with FiO2 50% and PEEP of 10. She
was able to move her upper extremities and grimaced to pain.

week. She walks short distances but uses a wheelchair for longer
distances.

Physical Exam:
On admit
General: sedated and intubated
CV: tachycardic with regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs,
rubs, gallops
Lungs: diffusely rhonchorous
Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no
organomegaly, no tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding

GU: foley present

Pertinent Results:
[**8-5**] head Ct w/o contrast
No ICH or calvarial frx.

[**8-5**] CXR
Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
patient
rotation on the current examination.  No evidence of pulmonary
edema.
Probable bibasilar opacities with possible associated pleural
effusions
favoring bibasilar atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
entirely
excluded.  No obvious pneumothorax is seen.

[**8-5**] CT-spine - No fracture or acute alignment abnormality.
Diffuse pharyngeal stranding that extends into the prevertebral
region is nonspecific in the setting of intubation, but a
ligamentous injury cannot be excluded.
.
[**8-5**] neck xray:
IMPRESSION:
An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip at the thoracic inlet.
 There is a right internal jugular central line with tip
projecting over the right lung apex.  There is a loop more
proximally which likely is external.  Clinical correlation is
advised.  Visualized lung apices are grossly clear.
.
[**8-8**] CXR:
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**8-7**], the monitoring
and support devices remain in place.  Cardiomediastinal contours
are stable.  Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with
substantial pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.  In
the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
have to be considered.

.
7/3 L shoulder xray
.LEFT SHOULDER: There is no fracture or dislocation. Mild AC
joint, degenerative changes are present. The visualized portion
of the left chest Preliminary Reportwall and lung show no gross
abnormality.
.LEFT HUMERUS: There is no fracture or dislocation. No soft
tissue
Preliminary Reportabnormalities are seen.
.
[**8-15**] CXR:
Right PICC line is most likely in the right atrium and should be
pulled back for approximately 4 cm.  Heart size and mediastinum
are stable.  Interval resolution of bibasal consolidations as
well as substantial decrease in pleural effusion is demonstrated
with only linear bibasal atelectasis seen.  Heart size and
mediastinum are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
70-year-old female with COPD who was found down and presented
with respiratory failure and septic shock.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
# Septic shock: The patient had septic shock likely secondary to
pneumonia. She was intubated in the field and recieved over 13L
IV fluid. When she arrived to the hospital she was hypotensive
and required pressor support. CXR showed vascular congestion and
possible right lower lobe pneumonia. She was given vancomycin,
zosyn and azithromycin. After she stablized, she improved with
diuresis and was extubated. Labs all improved and she was
eventually hemod
