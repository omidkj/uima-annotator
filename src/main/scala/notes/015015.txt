HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old
male with a history of HIV/AIDS, last CD4 count in [**2194-12-9**] of 34 with a viral load greater than 100,000, who
presented to an outside hospital with a complaint of
shortness of breath and fatigue.  The patient was feeling
relatively well until one week prior to his presentation when
he had dyspnea on exertion and increasing shortness of
breath.  He was evaluated at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital and
started on treatment for suspected pneumonia.  Of note, the
patient has had a slight cough for one week with production
of clear sputum, but he denies any fevers.

During this outside hospitalization, the patient experienced
sharp, burning chest pain radiating to the back which was
constant in nature.  A chest x-ray at the time demonstrated a
left lower lobe pneumonia, and he was started on
levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.  A chest CT scan
and transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a large
pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.  The patient
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
intervention.

Upon arrival, the patient had a temperature of 100.0, heart
rate 100, blood pressure 130/90, respiratory rate 23, and
oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.  A pulsus paradoxus of
20 mm Hg was noted.  Also significant on physical exam was an
elevated JV distention and crackles bilaterally.
Electrocardiogram on presentation demonstrated a sinus
tachycardia with no electrical alternans or ST-T wave
changes.  The patient was taken for pericardiocentesis with
removal of 900 cc of bloody pericardial fluid, and resolution
of his chest pain and of the pulsus paradoxus.

Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no
tamponade, and the patient was transported to the CCU for
observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. HIV diagnosed in [**2181**].  Studies in [**2195-7-9**] noted
CD4 34, viral load greater than 100,000.
2. No history of opportunistic infections other than thrush.
3. Hypertension.
4. Acute renal failure with glomerulonephritis, proteinuria,
and hematuria.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin causes eye swelling.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Dapsone 100 mg po q day.
2. Univasc 15 mg po q day.
3. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg po q day.
4. Atenolol 100 mg po q day.
5. Trizivir 1 mg po bid.
6. Biaxin 500 mg po q day.
7. Mycelex 10 mg po tid.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, the patient was
afebrile with a temperature of 99.1, heart rate 110, blood
pressure 145/95, respiratory rate 28, and oxygen saturation
93% on room air.  In general, the patient is a thin, pleasant
male in no apparent distress.  Oropharynx was clear with no
evidence of thrush.  Lungs had decreased breath sounds on the
left base with egophony.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
tachycardia with a normal S1, S2 and no murmurs or rubs.
Jugular venous distention was elevated at 10 cm.  Abdomen was
benign.  Extremities had no edema.

LABORATORIES:  Laboratory studies was significant for a white
blood cell count of 1.3 with 65% neutrophils and an absolute
neutrophil count of 720.  Hematocrit was 29.0, and platelets
were 100.  The MCV was 109.  Panel 7 was significant for a
BUN of 23, and creatinine of 1.3.  Magnesium was low at 1.3.
Albumin was 2.0.

Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a cardiac output of 4.32
and cardiac index of 2.44.  These rose respectively to 5.54
and 3.12 after pericardiocentesis.  Pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 22, right atrial pressure was 20, PA pressure
was 35/20, and RV pressure was 35/8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pericardial effusion:  The differential diagnosis in this
patient with HIV and AIDS is wide, including multiple
infectious causes such as tuberculosis, bacterial infection,
fungal infection, or viral infection.  Also in the
differential was neoplasm.  Pericardial fluid was sent for
evaluation and revealed a white blood cell count of 4,000,
red blood cell count of 4,500, with 5 polys, 5 lymphocytes,
and 80 atypicals.  Total protein was 5.8, and glucose was 34,
LDH was 2,217, amylase was 54, and albumin was 1.5.  Initial
Gram stain showed 1+ polys with no organisms, and at the time
of discharge, AFB stain was negative and bacterial cultures
were negative.  The AFB culture of the pericardial fluid was
pending.

Cytology of the pericardial fluid was pending at the time of
discharge as well, and this should be followed up by the
patient's PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is concerning for a neoplasm such as
lymphoma given the atypical cells noted on initial smear.
Post-pericardiocentesis, the patient had a pericardial drain
which produced 30 cc over 24 hours, and was discontinued
without further events.  Serial transthoracic echocardiograms
on postdrainage day one and two showed a stable, small
pericardial effusion.  The patient did not have a further
pulsus paradoxus or pericardial rub during the remainder of
his hospitalization, and a repeat echocardiogram several days
after discharge should be obtained to evaluate for
reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.

2. Pneumonia:  The patient was changed from ceftazidime to
cefepime given his low white blood cell count and possible
functional neutropenia.  He was maintained on cefepime for
several days for febrile neutropenia, though sputum cultures
were negative.  An induced sputum from [**2196-5-5**] demonstrated
a Gram stain with oropharyngeal flora, culture with rare
oropharyngeal flora as well as yeast, and negative PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was switched to oral levofloxacin, and should complete a
total 14 day course for pneumonia.

3. HIV:  Patient had recently restarted his HIV medications
after self discontinuing in the prior month.  His Trizivir
was held during his hospitalization as per the patient's
primary care provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] should follow up with his primary
care provider for determination of continuation of HIV
treatment in the near future.  A repeat CD4 count
demonstrated an absolute CD4 count of 27 during his
hospitalization.

4. Pancytopenia:  The cause of his pancytopenia was thought
to be malignancy.  Although the patient is HIV positive, he
had maintained stable counts and this is an acute decrease in
all cell lines.  CMV viral load was negative.  The patient
was started on filgrastim and responded well with a rise in
his white blood cell count to 5.5.  The patient's white count
was 4.1 at the time of discharge.  Following rehydration, the
patient's hematocrit was 25, and he was transfused with 2
units of packed red blood cells for this anemia.  Further
workup of the pancytopenia should proceed as an outpatient
following results from the pericardial fluid cytology.  The
patient's primary care physician may determine the need for
filgrastim treatment as an outpatient.

5. ID:  The patient did not have diarrhea during this
hospitalization, however, he did complain of diarrhea at the
outside hospital.  A Clostridium difficile toxin was
positive, and he was started on po Flagyl.  He remained
without abdominal pain or diarrhea during his
hospitalization, and he should complete a two week course of
Flagyl.

6. Hypertension:  The patient was initially normotensive
following his pericardiocentesis.  His antihypertensive
medications were held initially, but they were restarted as
he became hypertensive during his hospitalization to a
maximum pressure of 170/120.  He will be discharged on a half
dose of his antihypertensives until followup by his primary
care provider.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition to home.
