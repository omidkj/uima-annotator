Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
RML mass; recent hemorrhage after bx; contrast nephropathy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
rigid bronch + flex bronch + EBUS/TBNA + BAL/Brush/TBBX +
fluoroscopy with on-site cytology
Intubated on [**5-21**]
PICC placement in L arm on [**5-20**] and [**5-25**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75yoF with history of CVA, COPD (88 pack-year), DM,
HTN, HLD who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **] on [**5-10**] with
shortness of breath, fevers, chills, night sweats and 10lb wt
loss. In [**3-/2190**], she presented fevers, cough and shortness of
breath. CXR at that time found a PNA. She was to be admitted
however she left AMA with PO antibiotics. She then represented
on [**5-10**] with fevers and worsening dyspnea.

While at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **], she had a CT chest which showed a 10cm RML
compressing mass. Pulmonary was consulted and performed a flex
bronchoscopy, which was complicated by bleeding at biopsy
requiring 1 unit of pRBCs and prolonged intubation. She
ultimately extubated on [**5-16**]. Biopsy was ultimately
nondiagnostic. She then underwent a CT-guided biopsy which was
also nondiagnostic. Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for IP
evaluation and rigid bronchoscopy.

Hospitalization was also complicated by acute renal failure [**1-21**]
contrast induced nephropathy and ATN (possibly [**1-21**] hypotension
during bronchoscopy) and Cr peaked to 2.9 on [**5-18**] and trended
downward prior to transfer. Patient also had leukocytosis which
peaked to 20.8 on [**5-13**] and also trended down on transfer.

On transfer on [**5-20**], patient was appeared well although on
transfer to OR, per IP fellow, she appeared clammy. Her vital
signs were stable. She had a right IJ from [**Hospital1 **] that was
removed and replaced with midline.

During procedure, patient was intubated using rigid
bronchoscopy. An EBUS revealed RML mass. Several biospies were
completed and were uncomplicated (with minimal EBL). Frozen
sections unfortunately continued to be nondiagnostic. Upon
withdrawing rigid bronchoscope, 200cc of frank pus was
suctioned, which was thought to be distal to mass. Patient
received Zosyn intra-operatively. When finishing procedure,
noted to have ~50cc of frank bright red blood from LUL and LLL
(unknown source). Epinephrine was injected which resolved bleed.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable and did not require any
blood products. She did receive 1L NS. Patient remained
intubated for airway protection.

On arrival to the MICU on [**5-21**], patient was intubated and
sedation, not following any commands. She was hypotensive on
arrival but improved with 4L bolus of NS and UOP improved to
50cc/hr.

CXR ([**2190-5-20**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, the
patient still has a right internal jugular vein catheter.  The
tip of the catheter projects over the low SVC.  There is no
evidence of pneumothorax.  Bilateral areas of opacities at the
lung bases are atelectatic in nature.  The presence of minimal
pleural effusions cannot be excluded. The right lung mass
described on the referring note cannot be unequivocally
identified.

TTE ([**2190-5-24**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. No significant
valvular pathology.

CXR ([**2190-5-26**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, the
patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been
removed.  A left PICC line is in situ.  The tip projects over
the right atrium and should be pulled back by approximately 2
cm. There are unchanged relatively extensive right and moderate
left pleural effusions with signs of mild fluid overload as well
as atelectasis at the lung bases. The visible contours of the
cardiac silhouette are constant.  There is no evidence of
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year-old woman with history of CVA in [**2187**], HTN, HLD, DM,
COPD presented with fevers and worsening dyspnea and was found
to have RML mass at OSH transferred for rigid bronchoscopy that
identified purulent mass, without evidence of malignancy,
requiring 4 weeks of antibiotic threapy.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# LUNG MASS: Patient has large compressive RML mass that was
evaluated using rigid bronchoscopy revealed copious purulent
discharge from mass in RML that was concerning for abscess vs.
neoplasm with post-obstructive PNA. Frozen section from [**Hospital1 18**]
bronchoscopy was unrevealing and cultures grew strep anginosis
and viridans strep, pathology and cytology did not identify
malignancy. Patient initally received linezolid and zosyn that
was narrowed to ceftriaxone and flagyl after consultation with
ID. Antibiotics will be continued for at least 4 weeks. Patient
will follow up the Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3373**] in the interventional pulmonology
clinic in 4 weeks. Blood cultures from [**2190-5-22**] are pending.
