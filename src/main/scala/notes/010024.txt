Admission Date:  [**2179-11-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-11-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2119-5-19**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICINE-BLUMEGART
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hematemesis times 8-10 episodes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a pleasant
60-year-old female with a history of gastritis and
schizo-affective disorder who presented to the Emergency
coffee-ground emesis that started on [**11-3**] in the
evening and went over night until the morning of [**11-4**].
The patient stated that she had a total of [**8-7**] episodes of
coffee-ground and also complained of some light-headedness,
dizziness, and presyncope.  She also stated that she
experienced some shortness of breath, but this had been gone
on for the past couple of days.  She denied any chest pain or
noticing any bright red blood per rectum.  She stated that
she never had this kind of emesis before.

On arrival to the Emergency Department, her pulse was 95,
blood pressure 113/54, respirations 14, 99% on 2 L.  The
patient denied any recent change in her medications.  Her INR
in the Emergency Department was found to be 3.6, and so the
patient received 2 bags of fresh frozen plasma, 2 L of
intravenous fluids, and was typed and crossed for packed red
blood cells.  The GI Team was also notified.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hiatal hernia.  2.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  3.  Hyperlipidemia.  4.
Gastritis.  5.  Coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in [**2168**] with a catheterization that
showed apical/anterolateral akinesis, left anterior
descending with 80-90% stenosis and was stented.  Her most
recent echocardiogram was in [**2178-5-29**], which was a
Dobutamine echocardiogram, that showed reversible anterior
apical ischemia.  Her echocardiogram from [**2176-1-29**]
showed an ejection fraction of 30-35%, and no left
ventricular thrombus seen.  6.  Schizo-affective disorder.
7.  Cerebrovascular accident with right-sided weakness.

MEDICATIONS:  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Metoprolol 12.5 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ativan 0.5 mg 2
tab q.a.m., Risperdal 3 mg p.o. q.h.s., Trazodone 50 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Multivitamin, Coumadin 3 times a week; please note
that the Metoprolol and Neurontin were stopped since the end
of [**Month (only) **].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any alcohol intake but
stated that she does smoke.  She lives in a group home.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.7??????, pulse
94, blood pressure 113/72, respirations 14, 97% on room air.
General:  The patient appeared drowsy but in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Moist mucous membranes.  Poor dentition.
Neck:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No jugular venous
distention noted.  Cardiovascular:  S1 and S2.  Regular, rate
and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops heard.  Lungs:
Diffuse, coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Mildly
distended.  No peritoneal signs.  Soft.  No rebound.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  No spider angioma.  No caput medusa.
The patient was complaining of some diffuse tenderness.
Extremities:  Thin, contracted, right upper extremity.  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema noted.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 23, hematocrit
45.6, platelet count 450; sodium 145, potassium 5.5, chloride
39, bicarb 37, BUN 20, creatinine 1.4, glucose 137; ALT 14,
AST 26, alkaline phosphatase 147, amylase 72, lipase 8, total
bilirubin 0.6.

Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 95, right axis
deviation, T-waves in II, III, and AVF, poor R-wave
progression, no signs of ischemia.

Chest x-ray showed right shoulder injury, NG tube below the
diaphragm, large visible hiatal hernia, effusion of the right
lung base.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Upper GI bleed:  The patient had an NG
tube placed in the Emergency Department, and coffee-ground
emesis was suctioned out which did not clear.  GI was
immediately consulted who did an EGD and found no active
sights of bleeding; however, they did find a grade III
esophagitis and some gastritis.  At that time it was decided
that we should stop the anticoagulation, and the patient was
to be started on Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  In addition, GI
recommended that the patient go for barium swallow.

At that time, it was believed that the upper GI bleed was
probably secondary to gastritis, worse with anticoagulation
and hiatal hernia.  The patient had barium swallow that was
done on [**2179-11-9**], that showed a large paraesophageal
hernia but no evidence of any twisting or infarction at this
time.  According to the Radiology attending, it would be
ideal if Surgery was consulted.

The results were discussed with the patient, by both myself
and by the attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 79**], about the
importance of getting Surgery involved, but the patient
refused any surgery and stated that she would just take the
oral medications at this time.  The patient also was informed
that if the patient does not go for surgery, then the patient
may have her stomach infarcted and could possibly die.  She
is willing to take those chances.

During the hospital course, the patient did not have any
coffee-ground emesis, and the patient was tolerating p.o.
well.

2.  Hypoxia:  This was most likely secondary to aspiration
pneumonia as per the chest x-ray.  The patient did have 8-10
episodes of emesis which would account for that.  At this
time it was decided that the patient should be started on
Levofloxacin and Flagyl for a 14-day course for treatment of
aspiration pneumonia.  The patient was initially requiring
oxygen through nasal cannula, but two days before her
discharge, her nasal cannula was removed, and she was doing
well in room air, maintaining an oxygen saturation anywhere
between 92-96%.  The patient continued on antibiotics for ten
more days after discharge.

3.  Urinary tract infection:  The patient's urinalysis showed
some white cells and some bacteria in her urine.  At that
time it was decided that since the patient is getting
Levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia, she will be covered
for urinary tract infection.  A sensitivity was sent, but it
was not back at the time of discharge.

4.  Cardiology:  As per her echocardiogram report in [**2175**],
the patient has an ejection fraction of 30-35%.  The patient
is currently not on any cardiac medications.  The question
was brought up during her hospital course whether to start
her on ACE inhibitors, but given the fact that she had an
elevated BUN and creatinine, we decided to hold off on any
medications at this time.  In addition, beta-blocker was also
not started because the patient was having a blood pressure
anywhere between 90-100 systolic.  In addition, Aspirin was
also held off because of her bleeding episode.  The patient
is to follow-up with her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 15490**] in about one week, and this issue needs to be
readdressed, and the patient could possibly be restarted on
any cardiac medications.

5.  Psychiatric:  The patient has a history of
schizo-affective disorder.  The patient is currently stable
and is to continue on current medications.

6.  Alkalosis:  The patient initially presented with a bicarb
of 37.  Her Alkalosis was most likely secondary to
contraction alkalosis given the fact that she was volume
depleted and she had these multiple episodes of emesis.  The
patient received intravenous fluids throughout her hospital
course, and her alkalosis had resolved.

7.  FEN:  The patient was receiving intravenous fluids during
her hospital course because she was NPO and also because she
developed alkalosis and an elevated creatinine which could
indicate the patient was dry and was having prerenal acute
renal failure.  After receiving intravenous fluids, the
patient's creatinine had dropped from 1.6-0.9, and on the day
of discharge, her creatinine was 0.9, and her bicarb was down
to 27.

8.  Heme:  The patient's hematocrit has been in the range
between 27 and 32-33.  Her initial hematocrit was 45, but on
recheck was 33.  Her initial elevated hematocrit could be
secondary to the f
