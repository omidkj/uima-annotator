History of Present Illness:
60 year old gentleman with history of metastatic melanoma to the
brain and the liver, on decadron (higher dose compared to prior
admission; from 4 mg q 6 hr to 6 mg q 6 hr given gradual
weakness), presented with progressive worsening. [**Name (NI) **] wife
reports a steady decline over the last week, culminating on the
day admission with inability to walk or verbalize. Patient was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in clinic on Monday, and LP was performed. This
LP showed no evidence of infection. Patient is not on
chemotherapy or radiation therapy at this time. Wife reports
that patient was able to function minimally over the past week
but since night prior to admission has really not been able to
walk or verbalize. He is able to follow commands and understand
everything that is spoken to him. Patient triggered on arrival
to ED for nursing concern.

Of note, he was previously admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 8767**] with
confusion that was attributed to cerebral edema from his head
metastases. He carries a diagnosis of melanoma metastatic to the
head, lung, and liver. He was receiving treatment from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at
[**Hospital1 3278**], including gamma-knife in [**2163-3-10**], and had multiple
similar admissions in [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 205**] for confusion that improved
with pulse dexamethasone.  Attempts to wean steroids were met
with worsening confusion. He and his wife chose to transfer care
to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second opinion from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].  He follows in the
biologics clinic here, receiving off-label ipilimumab.  He
received a huge bolus of dexamethasone (10mg at home, 10IV in
the ED) with improvement of his confusion, however his FSG
ascended into the 400s requiring insulin coverage.  They
remained elevated in the 300 range at the time of discharge- and
he was sent out on metformin with FSG testing supplies, and an
appointment with his [**Name8 (MD) 6435**] NP was established within a few days
of discharge to assess the need for insulin.  He unfortunately
failed to followup, and his FSG were 300+ at home.  4-5 days
prior to admission he noted progressive weakness and decreased
strength of voice prompting ED presentation.

On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he had a glucose of 432 and an anion
gap of 30.  He was treated with an insulin gtt, aggressive
hydration, and repletion of electrolytes.  His gap subsequently
closed and  basal/bolus SubQ insulin was started, guided by
[**Last Name (un) **] consult.  FSG were still intermittently into the 300-400
range, and glargine was uptitrated as needed.

In the ED, T 98.4 HR 109 BP 142/96 RR 16 Sat100%RA. CT head was
done and per prelim report shwoed multiple hyperattenuating
supratentorial lesions with surrounding edema compatible with
metastatic disease, unchanged since [**2163-8-1**] CT exam. CXR did
not show acute process. UA was not suggestive of UTI. ALT was
notable to be 49 otherwise normal LFT. Lactate was 2.1. Serum
tox was negative.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were: 98.1, HR 111, BP
135/80, RR 13, Sat 97%RA. FS 242.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  from OMR notes
In [**8-/2159**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] biopsy of a right cheek skin
lesion revealing lentigo maligna.  He [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a wide local
excision with a focal positive margin with no further resection
at that time. In [**2161-9-9**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] abdominal US to
evaluate abdominal pain which revealed small gallstones. There
were liver nodules noted consistent with hemangiomas. He
[**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a liver MRI on [**2162-3-11**], revealing a dominant liver
nodule concerning for possible metastatic disease. Torso CT
revealed lung nodules.  On [**2162-3-18**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a brain MRI
revealing three brain lesions.  On [**2162-3-22**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a
CT-guided liver biopsy confirming melanoma.  He was subsequently
referred to [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a gamma
knife evaluation.  He [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1834**] gamma knife treatment to three
brain lesions on [**2162-4-9**] with brain MRI one month later
revealing stability. He began off protocol ipilimumab on
[**2162-6-1**]. F/U brain MRI in early [**Month (only) 216**] showed several new small
brain lesions without associated edema. He had evidence of
regression in SQ nodules at this time so he was observed. F/U
brain MRI revealed resolution of the largest CNS lesion with
growth in some smaller lesions felt to be ipilimumab effect.
Torso CT revealed continued improvement in systemic disease. He
[**Month (only) 1834**] Gamma knife therapy to 5 lesions on [**2163-4-9**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Torso CT was stable. He was admitted in [**2163-6-10**] twice at [**Hospital1 3278**]
for mental status changes responsive to steroids, presumably due
to edema surrounding known metastatic disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Status post traumatic neck injury in [**2160**]
after falling off a ladder, status post C-spine fusion;
2. history of chronic dysphagia from nutcracker esophagus
syndrome; 3. history of a frozen shoulder status post physical
therapy with
improvement in mobility
4. history of lentigo maligna of the right cheek.
5. Metastatic Melanoma as above


Social History:
The patient is married.  He is a nonsmoker.  He drinks rare ETOH
and has no illicit drug use.  He worked as a painting contractor
as well as real estate [**Doctor Last Name 360**].


Family History:
no history of melanoma
