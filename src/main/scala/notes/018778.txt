Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
Intoxication/Hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.


History of Present Illness:
47F history of depression, HCV, polysubstance abuse, and
longstanding prior rubbing alcohol ingestions with residual
ataxia, presenting with lethargy and questionable overdose. Per
report, pt was found minimally responsive at home by her sister.
She was minimally responsive to sternal rub, and it is unclear
how long she was like this. On arrival to the ED, systolic blood
pressures were measuring in the 80's to 100's mmHg. She received
2 L NS with improvement in her mental status and was able to
communicate that she ingested rubbing alcohol earlier on.
  In the ED, EKG showed no QT/QRS prolongation. CT head and CXR
were both negative. Labs showed a normal WBC count with 40
percent PMN's, macrocytosis with HCT of 37.6, UA was negative
for signs of infection with trace ketones, serum tox negative
for ASA, EtOH, APAP, benzos, barbituates, or TCAs. Urine tox was
positive for  cocaine. Cardiac enzymes were negative. CK of 300.
CMP showed creatinine of 1.2 (baseline around 0.9), no evidence
of a gap. Serum OSMS were 364 with a calculated OSMS of about
288 (gap of 76).
  Toxicology was consulted and suggested fomepizole
administration if AG present. Patient's CMP was rechecked to
affirm no evidence of an anion gap, thus making ethanol or
methylene glycol ingestion unlikely. Blood pressures continued
to be in the high 70's to low 80's systolic.
  Prior to transfer to MICU, vitals were HR 80 BP 88/51 RR19
100% 2L. Blood pressure still in the 80's systolic after rec'd
total 2L NS IV. Access 2 peripheral 18g.  Per report pt was
alert, communicating, but unclear of date. She received another
1 L NS on transit to MICU.
  On the floor, patient is non verbal. She opens eyes to command
but otherwise is not answering questions. She can squeeze
fingers. BP on arrival is 110/67.

CT Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Echo ([**2154-6-29**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 F history of HCV, polysubstance abuse (crack cocaine, EtOH,
prior rubbing alcohol ingestions with residual ataxia &
?cognitive decline), p/w lethargy and hypotension, likely [**12-26**] to
OD, clinically improved & stable, back to baseline.
.
#Hypotension: Patient's BP improved to 100's systolic after
receiving 3 L NS in the ED. Differential includes hypovolemia in
setting of toxin ingestion and poor po intake or secondary
effect of toxin as a CNS depressant. Other concerns are
cardiomyopathy and depressed CO in the presence of frequent
crack cocaine abuse. There was no evidence of infection or
decompensated liver disease based on laboratory data. Patient
had no signs of decompensated heart failure and TTE was WNL,
EF>55%, no structural disease.
.
#Isopropanol Alcohol Ingestion: Isopropanol ingestion was most
likely cause of elevated osmolal gap in absence of anion gap
acidosis. Osmolal gap continued to diminish with subsequent
measurements (83->69->47). Absence of anion gap makes ethylene
glycol/methylene glycol ingestion unlikely, and patient was
ethanol negative on tox screen. Isopropyl alcohol ingestion may
also cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and gastritis, but
repeat CXR did showed no effusion/pulmonary edema. GI
prophylaxis with pepcid per toxicology recommendations were
given during her hospital stay.
.
#HCV: LFTs and albumin were checked and were unremarkable.
.
# PNA vs aspiration pneumonitis: Repeat CXR ([**2154-6-29**]) shows
"possible developing left basilar infiltrate," but throughout
entire admission, patient did not develop any s/s of SOB, cough,
CP, fever, or any other concerning s/s of infection.
.
# Depression/Substance abuse: pt stated that she wasn't
interested in quitting or treating substance abuse but after
family visit yesterday, became more interested in seeking help.
When psychiatry and social work saw her, she regressed a bit and
was precontemplative. She was given a list of local NA and
strongly encouraged to call her PCP should she change her mind
and want to enter into a detox
