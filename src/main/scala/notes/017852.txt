Admission Date:  [**2164-5-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2164-5-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2092-8-19**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHOR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old
Russian male with a history of an myocardial infarction in
[**2152**] in [**Country 532**], who developed a syncopal episode while at his
primary care physician's office on a routine visit.  The
patient reports that he was in his usual state of health
until the day prior to admission, where he felt chilled and
fatigued and developed malaise.  The morning of admission, he
ate breakfast and went to his previously scheduled
appointment and while waiting in the Waiting Room, felt his
heart beating fast and he blacked out.  It was reported that
the syncopal episode lasted a few seconds.  The patient
denied any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or abdominal pain at this
time.  The patient's primary care physician called emergency
medical services, who transferred him to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Room for further
evaluation.

Of note, the patient has known coronary artery disease status
post catheterization times three with his most recent being
in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year which showed three-vessel disease.
The patient when evaluated previously was told that he was
not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate due to poor
touchdown.

He also has a history of a clot in the left ventricular that
is anti-coagulated appropriately.

He also denies any changes in bowel habits, dysuria or
hematuria.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Anterolateral myocardial infarction in [**2152**] in [**Country 532**],
medically treated.
2.  Ejection fraction of 20%.
3.  Known left ventricular clot.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Isordil 20 mg p.o. three times a day.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is significant for a mother
passing away from coronary artery disease and the father
dying young of unknown cause.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any tobacco or ETOH use.
He is retired and lives with wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has two sons.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 98.8 F.;
pulse 72; blood pressure of 102/64; respiratory rate of 20.
The patient is in no acute distress.  The pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.  There is no jugular venous
distention.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The chest is clear bilaterally.
The abdomen is soft and nontender, nondistended, with normal
bowel sounds.  He has extremity pulses bilaterally and he has
no peripheral edema.

LABORATORY:  On admission include a white blood cell count of
6.1, hematocrit of 40.7, platelets of 180.  Sodium 137,
potassium 4.9, chloride of 101, bicarbonate of 25, BUN of 14,
creatinine of 1.0, glucose of 128.

CK was 166, MB fraction of 2, troponin of less than 0.3.

Chest x-ray showed a left ventricular enlargement without
heart failure; no significant abnormalities.

EKG showed sinus rhythm at the rate of 78.  There were ST
segment elevations in leads II, III, AVF, V3 through V5; ST
depressions in I and AVL.

Catheterization done on [**2164-2-15**], was significant for
three-vessel disease.  The left main had a 20% stenosis; the
left anterior descending had a 60% stenosis.  The left
circumflex has a 30 to 40% stenosis.  The obtuse marginal 1
was occluded.  The right coronary artery had a 70% stenosis.
There was global hypokinesis at the left ventricular.  His
apex was akinetic and the left ventricular ejection fraction
was estimated to be 27%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Medicine Service.  He ruled out for an myocardial infarction
by enzymes.  He was evaluated by the Electrophysiology
Service who believed that he would benefit from an
Electrophysiology Study and possible placement of an AICD due
to his presentation of syncope.  He remained hemodynamically
stable on the floor.  His medical therapy was optimized.  The
patient did have an episode of chills on hospital day number
two and had a temperature maximum of 100.9 F.   Blood
cultures and urine were sent which were negative.  He was not
on any empiric antibiotics at this time.

An echocardiogram was performed which was significant for an
ejection fraction of 35% from the left ventricle.  The
echocardiogram was significant for resting regional wall
motion abnormality including akinesis of the distal left
ventricle and dyskinesis of the true apex.  There was two
plus mitral regurgitation.

The patient was evaluated by Cardiothoracic Surgery and after
discussion with the patient and his family, it was decided
that the patient would undergo coronary artery bypass
grafting with left ventricular aneurysm repair.  On hospital
day number four, the patient went to the Operating Room with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] and the Cardiothoracic Team and underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times four with resection and patch
repair of the left ventricular aneurysm.  Grafts were left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to diagonal; saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to distal right
coronary artery.  He also underwent a D'or procedure which is
resection of the ventricular aneurysm and endoventricular
patch, and cryo ablation of the endocardium.

The patient tolerated this procedure well and was transferred
to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.  Bypass time 175 minutes; cross-clamp time 129
minutes.  The patient entered with Propofol and
Neo-synephrine.  He remained postoperatively hemodynamically
stable.  He was extubated without incident.  Chest tube
output was appropriate.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was weaned off
of all drips.  He was transfused two units of packed red
blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.0.  The patient remained
in the CRCU for close monitoring overnight.  On postoperative
day number two, chest tubes were discontinued without
incident.  The patient continued to improve.  Hematocrit
stabilized at 28.

On postoperative day number three, the patient was
transferred to the floor for the remainder of his recovery.
The patient continued to improve.  Physical Therapy evaluated
the patient and he is currently in Activity Level 5.  The
patient has been tolerating a cardiac diet.  The patient has
remained in sinus rhythm and hemodynamically stable.  The
patient has remained afebrile.

A follow-up urine culture was sent which was positive for E.
coli 10,000 to 100.000 organisms.  The patient was started on
Ciprofloxacin.  The patient's white count has remained stable
at 10.0, and there is no left shift.  He has also remained
afebrile.  The patient was followed by the Electrophysiology
Service.  The patient was scheduled to have an
electrophysiology study and likely AICD placement during this
admission, prior to discharge.

The patient, understanding the risks of not having this
procedure after numerous discussions with the
Electrophysiology Service and his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 3357**], has decided to postpone undergoing the
electrophysiology study during this admission.  He will
follow-up with the Electrophysiology Clinic in three weeks
for the study.  The patient has otherwise done well, is
stable and can be discharged home at this time.
