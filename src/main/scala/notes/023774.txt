Imaging:
CT head
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation appears preserved. There is no edema or mass
effect. There
is a similar appearance to the right frontal encephalomalacia.
Additional
hypodensity in the periventricular region is compatible with
small vessel
ischemic change. The ventricles and sulci are unremarkable given
the patient's
age. The visualized portion of the mastoid air cells and
paranasal sinuses
are clear.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR:
FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of the right central
line and
endogastric tube. The heart size is enlarged, similar to
slightly improved
compared to prior study. The mediastinal contours are within
normal limits.  The lungs show no lobar consolidation, although
the pulmonary vasculature does appear mildly engorged. There is
no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no heart
failure or
pneumonia.
