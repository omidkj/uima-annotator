diarrhea and cough. She was initially covered with pip/tazo and
linezolid for a possible HAP, which were held when the patient
did not have a consolidation on CXR with BCx and rapid viral
screen negative. Antimicrobials were held on [**2101-8-21**] given
suspicion of bacterial HAP was low, and patient has remained
afebrile since without dyspnea or productive cough since. She
has continued to have persistent diarrhea, however, with C.diff
toxin [**Doctor First Name **] negative x1, with further stool studies pending
although felt by the floor team to be viral gastroenteritis. Of

[**2101-8-23**]
Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
Superior mesenteric artery angiogram showing active
extravasation of contrast
from one of the branches of right colic artery. Unsuccessful
selective
catheterization of right colic artery and hence failed
embolization.



Brief Hospital Course:
A surgery consult was obtained. It was noted that there was
active LGIB w/ diverticular disease of entire colon. GI was
unable to scope due to much blood. On [**8-23**], interventional
radiology noted brisk arterial bleed from one of the branches of
right colic artery was on superior mesenteric angiography.  They
were unsuccessful at selective catheterization of the right
colic artery after several attempts and the procedure was
abandoned. She recieved a total of 6 units of PRBC for
hematochezia.  On [**8-23**], she was then taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for right colectomy for lower GI bleed. Please refer to
operative note for details. It was noted that a side-to-side
functional end-to-end ileal colostomy was performed.

Postop, hematocrit stabilized at 31-32. Aspirin was resumed at
half dose daily.  Postop, she spent one day in the SICU while
intubated. She was successfully extubated and transferred out of
the SICU. She was kept npo until passing flatus. Diet was slowly
advanced. Supplements were started due hypoglycemia 59-74 due to
po po intake. She did experience some diarrhea on [**8-28**]. Stool
was sent for c.diff on [**8-30**]. Stool softners were held.

Pain was controlled with dilaudid pca that was later switched to
po dilaudid when diet was tolerated. She did experience
intermittent confusion that was concerning for possible side
effect of dilaudid. Dilaudid was switched to vicodin.

Confusion was also likely secondary to her hypercalcemia
(calcium increased to [**11-10**])that was managed with hemodialysis
and adjustment of her meds. Calcium was elevated due to low phos
and inability to take sensapar.  Phoslo was stopped and renagel
started. Cinacalcet was increased to 90mg. Calcitriol was
stopped. She received Epogen and zemplar while at HD. Of note,
the patient is allergic to heparin therefore she receives sodium
citrate in place of heparin while on dialysis.

She continued to receive dialysis, but due to need to dialyze on
[**8-29**] for hypercalcemia, the Tues-Thursday-Sat schedule was
thrown off. She will require dialysis on Wed [**8-31**].
Annti-hypertensives were held preop given GIB. Most of these
were subsequently resumed. BP stabilized on valsartan, labetalol
and amlodipine).

She remained afebrile. WBC normalized. Abdomen appeared
distended with the incision appeared mildly erythematous on [**8-29**]
and keflex (renally dosed)was started for a 5 day course.

PT evaluated and found the patient in need of rehab. The plan
was for discharge to [**Hospital **] Rehab [**Telephone/Fax (1) 58445**] on [**8-30**].
