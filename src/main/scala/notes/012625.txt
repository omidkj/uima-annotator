HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year old
male with a history of oral cancer status post partial
glossectomy in [**2143-2-15**] and [**2143-7-18**], who was
admitted on [**2144-6-1**], for recurrent right oropharyngeal
tumor with extension to the floor of the mouth and the neck.
The patient underwent right composite resection with
segmental vestibulectomy, RLT hemiglossectomy, and pectoral
flap reconstruction of the floor of the mouth and neck.
After surgery the patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit, intubated, on antibiotics, Cefazolin and Flagyl,
and on intravenous fluids.

Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasounds were obtained to
rule out deep venous thrombosis because the Venodyne were off
in the Operating Room.  Ultrasound was negative for deep
venous thrombosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On postoperative day one, tube feeds were
started and the next day, the patient was weaned off the
ventilator and under sedation.  On postoperative day three,
speech and swallow was consulted and a Passy-Muir valve was
placed.

On postoperative day five, the patient was transferred to the
floor and was able to ambulate, however, by postoperative day
seven, the patient's course was complicated by tongue
ischemia and dehiscence of the flap along the midline of the
throat with fistula formation.

The next day, the patient was taken to the Operating Room for
washout and closure but subsequently needed additional
debridement on postoperative day ten.  In the Operating Room,
the patient also received a J-tube for continuation of his
tube feeds secondary to concerns of malnutrition, with an
albumin of 2.9.

The next day, postoperative day eleven, the patient's tube
feeds were restarted and his antibiotics were changed to
Levofloxacin 500 mg q. day from Ancef based on cultures
growing Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, beta
Strep and Serratia marcescens, pan sensitive.

On postoperative day thirteen, the patient was taken back to
the Operating Room for a free rectus myocutaneous free flap
for reconstruction of the floor of the mouth.  After surgery,
the patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit and the next day, he was weaned off the ventilator and
on postoperative day fifteen, he was transferred to the floor
in stable condition on the Plastics Service.

Postoperative day seventeen, the patient was able to
ambulate, tolerated tube feeds.  His trache was changed to a
#6 cuffless Shiley.  Postoperative day eighteen, the patient
was discharged home with services.
