History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with DM (NIDDM), AFib on sotalol and digoxin,
HTN found by EMS at home to be tripoding, unable to speak more
than one word at a time.  She denied CP, but said she got
suddenly SOB at 11:30 p.m. the night prior and said she felt
like she "was dying."  Per family, she has not had any known
recent fevers and her abdomen apparently looked more distended
per the family but she was not complaining of this.  In the
ambulance, she was in sinus rhythm, HR 87 w/ LBBB compared to
prior with 2mm ST elevations in V1-V2 with TWI and ST
depressions in V4-6, I, II and TWIs in II, III, aVF (only change
in III with upright QRS compared to prior).  Pt then develeoped
a wide complex tachy concerning for VTach and was shocked with
200J x 2 and 360J x 1.  At [**Hospital 46**] Hosp, she was loaded with Amio
150mg and put on Amio gtt 1 mg/kg/min.  She was intubated with
initial gas 7.07/60/163.  She received Lasix 20 iv x 2, 4 mg
Morphine and placed on Nitro gtt for bp in 160's, ASA 325, Hep
and Integrelin gtts and given Rochepin 1g x 1.  Trop < 0.02, Dig
level < 0.04 at OSH.  Pt also received Plavix 600mg x1.  Pt was
found to be in DKA with BS 384 and anion gap 17, given 5 u
insulin and placed on insulin gtt.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cath w/ ABG 7.12/52/236 and lactate 11.
     In the cath lab, pt was HD unstable on Nitro with sbp drop
to 30's.  Nitro was stopped and Dopamine was started.  She had
episodes of VTach and shocked twice.  She remained hypoxic
despite mech ventilation and PaO2 50-60's.  Levophed was added.
Cath showed no significant CAD.  Limited Ventriculogram showed
EF 35%, PA gram without thrombus, and ? healed VSD with ? Right
to Left shunt given decreased PaO2.  IABP placed and she was
transferred to CCU on dopa and Levophed gtts.

Portable chest, [**2163-2-13**]
An intraaortic balloon pump is present with the radiodense tip
terminating
approximately 3 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob.
An
endotracheal tube terminates about 4.5 cm above the carina, and
a Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right interlobar
pulmonary artery. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
There is vascular engorgement, and there is a bilateral pattern
of perihilar alveolar opacities, with sparing of the extreme
lung periphery. This is asymmetric, right greater than left, and
is superimposed upon a more diffuse interstitial pattern with
bilateral septal thickening. An area of hyperlucency is seen
adjacent to both heart borders and probably is related to
pulsation artifact. Anterior medial pneumothoraces are
considered less likely, but attention to these areas on followup
chest radiograph is suggested.
IMPRESSION:
1. Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
2. Extensive pulmonary edema.
3. Hyperlucency adjacent to both heart borders.
.
[**2163-2-13**] KUB:
A nonobstructive bowel gas pattern is visualized. Contrast
material is
identified within the renal collecting systems and bladder.
Correlation with timing of contrast administration is suggested,
as no contrast enhanced CT scans are reported at this
institution. A nasogastric tube is noted within the stomach.
Femoral vascular catheters are noted bilaterally, with a left
femoral venous line coursing into the IVC. On a separately
dictated chest radiograph, this is shown to represent a
pulmonary arterial catheter.
.
[**2163-2-16**]:  Non-contrast axial head CT.
FINDINGS: There are multiple hypodense foci scattered throughout
the
subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres,
representing the
sequela of small vessel infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
junction is intact. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci
demonstrate no effacement. There is no mass effect or shift of
normally midline structures. There is a fluid level within the
sphenoid sinus, likely be secondary to intubation. Bilateral
mastoid air cells demonstrate some opacification that could be
air, fluid, or combination of the two, again likely the result
of intubation. The other paranasal sinuses are clear.
The osseous structures are unremarkable. Calcification of the
cavernous
carotid arteries is secondary to atherosclerotic disease.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage. MR brain is
recommended for the evaluation of acute brain ischemia, if of
clinical concern.
.
[**2163-2-17**]: MRI OF THE BRAIN.
FINDINGS: There are areas of abnormality on the
diffusion-weighted sequence in the left parietal and left
occipital lobe. There are corresponding abnormalities on the
FLAIR sequence consistent with subacute infarcts. The areas of
abnormality are small consistent with multiple emboli and
multiple distributions. There is no definite evidence of mass
effect or hemorrhage. There are multiple T2 high signal
intensity foci in the periventricular white matter and centrum
semiovale consistent with microvascular angiopathy. There is no
evidence of a focal extra-axial lesion or fluid collection.
IMPRESSION: Multiple diffusion abnormalities in the left
hemisphere as
described. Some of these are referable to the middle cerebral
artery
circulation, some referable to the posterior. It is noted that
there is a
fetal type posterior communicating artery on the left, so that
these might
represent systemic emboli but may also represent emboli from a
left carotid lesion.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS MAJOR TRIBUTARIES.
FINDINGS: There is no definite evidence of aneurysm. The left
vertebral
artery is not visualized and may be occluded below the level of
foramen
magnum. There is a fetal type posterior communicating artery on
the left,
supplying the left posterior cerebral artery. The P1 portion of
the left
posterior cerebral artery is diminutive. There appears to be
some reduced
flow in the posterior cerebral artery on the left compared to
the right.
IMPRESSION: Fetal type posterior communicating artery on the
left, so that
the lesions noted on the brain MR may be coming fro
