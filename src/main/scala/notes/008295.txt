CT Head [**2174-5-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderately large right frontotemporal subgaleal hematoma
without
underlying skull fracture seen.
2. 7-mm acute right frontotemporal, acute subdural hematoma and
small
bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages.
3. Ventricular prominence slightly out of proportion to sulcal
prominence.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2174-5-21**]
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Large right lateral upper thigh hematoma with findings
suggesting active
extravasation.
2. Fluid surrounding the pancreas is concerning for
pancreatitis. Bowel
injury is also a consideration in the trauma setting, but no
bowel wall
thickening or free air is seen. Mild dilation of pancreatic duct
without
demonstrable obstructing mass is of uncertain significance.
3. Distended gallbladder which contains a couple of gallstones.
No CT
evidence of wall thickening. Minimal stranding along gallbladder
base likely secondary to pancreatic process. If there remains
concern for acute
cholecystis, formal ultrasound would be recommended for further
assessment.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.

Repeat head CT scan [**2174-5-22**]
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right subdural hematoma and
intraventricular
hemorrhage. Stable moderate ventriculomegaly, which may be
related to
cerebral atrophy, but a component of hydrocephalus cannot be
excluded.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. No LA mass/thrombus (best excluded by
TEE).

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal IVC
diameter (<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration
(estimated RA pressure (0-5mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). False LV tendon
(normal variant). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal descending
aorta diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch
coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild to moderate ([**12-3**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+]
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Mild PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen
(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a very small circumferential
pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has moderate aortic stenosis. Based on [**2170**] ACC/AHA
Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is
asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-3**]
years.
Based on [**2171**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.







Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. She was given platelets
in the emergency room for reversal of her Aggrenox. She also
required several units of packed cells for falling hematocrit
(lowest 22 on admission) in the setting of hemodynamic
instability (most recent Hct 20 on [**5-24**]). She underwent pelvic
arteriogram because of gluteal hematoma and concern for active
extravasation and decreasing hematocrit despite transfusions. No
