Attending:[**Doctor First Name 5188**]
Chief Complaint:
Perforation of small bowel at the site of the ileostomy with
purulent peritonitis.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2118-11-16**] Laparoscopic loop ileostomy
[**2118-12-6**] Hemorrhoid banding
[**2118-12-26**] Exploratory laparotomy, takedown of
loop ileostomy, small bowel resection, creation of end
ileostomy and mucous fistula.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a previous medical
history significant for Crohn's disease. She presently has
evidence of a stricture in the distal terminal ileum, and
because of that, the patient recently underwent laparoscopic
creation of a diverting loop ileostomy. It should be added that
the patient had this more conservative surgical treatment rather
than a cecal resection because of poor heart condition and
severe COPD, both of which were considered contraindications for
more extensive surgical procedures.

The ileostomy was created approximately 1 month ago, and since
then the patient has been doing well up until yesterday when the
ileostomy output suddenly stopped and the patient developed
significant abdominal pain. Initial imaging studies with KUB and
CT scan were consistent with small bowel obstruction close to
the ileostomy, and there was some concern whether the patient
had intraluminal content that created a mechanical obstruction.
The KUB and CT scan did not show any evidence of free air. The
patient was initially
managed with a nasogastric tube and a Foley was also placed in
the afferent loop of the ileostomy yielding large amount of
small bowel content, whereafter the abdomen became less a tender
and distended. Today, however, the abdominal pain has continued
and worsened, and her abdominal exam has also worsened and we
are concerned of  peritonitis why the patient now was taken to
the operating room for exploration.

RADIOLOGY:
ABDOMINAL XR [**2118-11-4**]: Small bowel obstruction, similar to
prior, without free air.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/CONTRAST [**2118-11-5**]:
1. Persistent small bowel obstruction upstream of ileal
stricture with
associated stranding and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, suggestive
of possible acute on chronic inflammation, without evidence of
abscess, fistula, or perforation.
2. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with
associated
atelectasis.
3. Interval decrease of small abdominal ascites.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. Mild anasarca.
6. Diverticulosis.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHO [**2118-11-8**]:
LVEF 30%. Severe regional and global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild to moderate ischemic mitral
regurgitation.

ABDOMINAL XR [**2118-11-21**]:
1. Dilated loops of small bowel, likely postoperative ileus;
however, small-bowel obstruction cannot be ruled out.
2, Intra-abdominal free air believed to be secondary to recent
laparoscopic surgery.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHO [**2118-11-22**]:
Cannot fully exclude a vegetation on the mitral valve; no
vegetations seen elsewhere. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Dilated left ventricle with moderate to severe
regional and global systolic dysfunction.
.
TEE [**11-23**]- Two mobile right atrial echodensities associated with
the pacing leads consistent with vegetation (vs thrombus) as
described above. ?Aortic valve Lambls excrecent (vs.
vegetation). Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] notified of the results by telephone.
.
CXR [**12-1**]-PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed
in comparison to [**2118-11-26**].
The pacemaker leads terminate in expected location of right
atrium and right ventricle. The right PICC line tip is at the
level of cavoatrial junction.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. Small amount of right pleural effusion cannot be
excluded. Lungs are essentially clear.
.
KUB [**2118-12-12**]-IMPRESSION: No obstruction or free air.
.
ECHO [**2118-12-12**]- Severe focal LV hypokinesis consistent with CAD.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, likely due to leaflet
tethering.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2118-11-22**], the findings are probably similar.
.
KUB [**12-16**]- IMPRESSION: No obstruction or free air.
