Chief Complaint:
Transfer post VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and extubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 44 year old woman with history of hypothyroidism,
asthma, depression, GERD, ETOH abuse who was found down s/p VF
arrest with return of spontaneous circulation.
.
History taken from wife.  The patient had been in her usual
state of health, watching the celtics game with her wife when
she became unresponsive.  At approximately 9:30, patient
appeared to slump to one side with "funny" breathing and became
non-respnosive.  Earlier that night, she had been drinking a
"couple glasses of wine" but was without any complaints: no
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness,
fevers, chills.  She did not have any tremors, bowel/urinary
incontinence.  Of note, she chronically drinks about 2 bottle of
wines per night for the past few years.  Wife does not think she
had overingestion of medications or any illicit drug use. Her
wife found that she stopped breathing and called 911.  She
delivered 5 rescue breaths and by that time EMS had arrived.
.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 **], CPR was given and AED applied, with shock
x1 for vfib.  She was intubated.  She was then given epi x2 and
atropine x1 with a perfusing pulse and shocked again for vtach.
Her VS at [**Hospital1 **] on admission were HR 140s, 161/112, 100%. Her
labs were notable for a Cr 1, ETOH 345, K 3.3, CO2 17. She
received amiodarone load, versed and fentanyl boluses, 1 L NS,
and started on versed and levo drip.  Her ECGs were notable for
sinus tachy w/ PVCs.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Her labs were notable for lactate
of 6.4, serum ETOH 248, negative for ASA, Acetmnphn, Benzo,
Barb, Tricyc. She was continued on levo, versed, and amiodarone
drips. Post-arrest team was contact[**Name (NI) **] with goal 33C x 24h. VS
prior to transfer: 97, 87, 100%, 108/44.
.
ROS unable to be obtained.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2156-5-24**] at 11:08:18 AM  The left
atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal half of the
anterior wall and severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments
(LVEF = 25%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size with severe global
dysfunction c/w diffuse process. No valvular pathology or
pathologic flow identified.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2156-5-31**] at 3:59:26 PM  The left
atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2156-5-24**], the left ventricular systolic function
has improved to normal.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2156-5-26**]
9:05 AM FINDINGS: There is a tiny filling defect in a
subsegmental artery within the right middle lobe (3:41 and
403B:46). No other filling defects are seen. There is no
dissection. There is bibasilar atelectasis with no evidence of
aspiration pneumonia. The heart size is normal without
pericardial effusion. There is no hilar, axillary, or
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The endotracheal tube ends
approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is coiled
within the stomach, completely seen on the coronal scout view.
There is a nodular soft tissue density within the left breast
which measures 2.0 cm x 1.3 cm. Although this examination is not
tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the visualized aspects
of the upper abdomen are within normal limits. BONE WINDOWS:
There is a slight anterior cortical deformity to the sternum,
seen on the sagittal reformats. This may be the sequelae of CPR.
Otherwise, no concerning osseous lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: 1. Tiny filling defect within a subsegmental
pulmonary artery in the right middle lobe. This may represent a
tiny pulmonary embolism. However, no other filling defects
noted. 2. Bibasilar atelectasis with no evidence of aspiration
pneumonia. 3. Soft tissue density nodule in the left breast.
Please correlate with mammography.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-5-27**] 7:37 AM FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in configuration. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. There
