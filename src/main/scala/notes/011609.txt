CXR - no acute cardiopulmonary process.
BCx - sent.
Radiology:
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2131-4-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant interval change in nodal size and massive
splenomegaly.
2. Increasing opacification in the right lower lobe may have an
infectious etiology.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2131-4-17**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No pathology is identified to explain the patient's source of
fever.
2. Unchanged size and appearance of multiple mesenteric and
retroperitoneal nodes. Unchanged massive splenomegaly.
3. Interval development of moderate right and small left pleural
effusion and interval development of ascites.
.
Ultrasound of RUE:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
2. Subcutaneous edema in the area of swelling in the right
forearm.
.
-----------------
Cardiology:
EKG [**2131-4-14**]: Sinus tachycardia. There is a late transition
which is probably normal. Low voltage. Compared to the previous
tracing low voltage is new.
.
Echo [**4-15**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-8-8**], the
findings are similar with limited views except for mild mitral
regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pericardial effusion. Normal biventricular systolic function.
.

Lumbar Puncture
 - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bronchoscopy
 - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old female with hx of CLL who presented to the ED with
fever x 2 days up to 101.9 day 23 s/p second cycle of FCR
(Fludarabine, Cytoxan and Rituxan).  In the ED, she was not
neutropenic but did have an episode of hypotension that
responded to IVF.  Currently looks well and remains
hemodynamically stable.  Patient admitted to the BMT service for
management.
.
#Febrile Neutropenia/ID: Patient was continued on broad
neutropenic coverage with cefepime and vancomycin on admission
given hypotension in ED and counts < 100
