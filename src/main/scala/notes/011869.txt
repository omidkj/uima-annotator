History of Present Illness:
(per records, girlfriend)
This patient is a 59 year old male with a PMH of chronic pain,
HTN, HLD, IVDA who initially presented to his PCP several days
ago with cough/ congestion seen by PCP and started on a z-pack
for concern of bronchitis but he has not been taking the
antibiotics. His girlfriend states that he has been slowly
decling over the past few weeks. He takes large amounts of
oxycontin and dilaudid at baseline and she has noticed that her
pain medications have gone missing too. He has also been using
heroine, last use [**11-15**]. Has been noted to have minimal PO
intake, occasionally drooling, noted to have increased lethargy.
Lethargy and cough have been worsening over the last 5 days. On
[**11-15**], he developed shortness of breath and diffuse rhonchi
which worsened over afternoon. Pt became somnolent, minimally
responsive and tachpneic in his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]. EMS was called by
PCP and found him altered with O2 saturation 85%.
.
On arrival to BD [**Location (un) 620**], his VS were T 97.3 HR: 89 BP: 117/50
Resp: 20 O(2)Sat: 82% RA 100% NRB. CXR showed question of CHF
vs. PNA. He was given vanc/zosyn/flagyl for presumed pneumonia.
He became more somnolent and was intubated at BIDN. Sedation was
Fent/Versed gtt. Labs were significant for hct 22, trop T 0.152,
BNP elevated 63k. EKG showed TWI in V2-V4. Stools guaiac
negative and he was transfused one unit PRBCs. There was no
report of bleeding. He was given Aspirin PR. Transferred by
[**Location (un) 7622**]. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], his HCT was 25. EKG showed T
wave inversions in V2-V4. His most recent VS prior to transfer
to the MICU were: T 99.3 P 78, BP 99/31 CVP 20, vent settings
FiO2 100, Peep 5, Tidal Volume 550.
.
On the floor, patient was intubated, minimally sedated.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PREBYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. There are large vegetations on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Severe (4+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen due to
restricted mitral valve leaflets. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. No clot in LAA. Slightly
dilated coronary sinus.
These finding were discussed with the surgical team.
POSTBYPASS: Normal LV function with LVEF > 55% and not segmental
wall motion abnormalities. Normally functioning aortic valve
prosthesis. Moderate to severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] vena contracta > 7.0 mm
but PA pressures were much less ( mean PA pressrures [**12-2**]
systemic) and the TR was much less (mild to moderate). No
dissection seen after aortic cannula removed. These findings
were discussed with surgical team.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16165**] is a 59 year old male with a past medical history of
chronic pain, hypertension, HLD, IV drug abuse who initially
presented with bacteremia, endocarditis, and renal failure.  His
blood cultures grew pansensitive enterococcus in the blood from
an outside hospital, which were the likely cause for septic
emboli and vegetations. An MRI of his head showed multiple
emboli. He was intially given vancomycin and zosyn but then was
switched to ampicillin and gentamicin. Patient with large
pneumonia seen on CXR. CT showed 5-cm right upper lobe
consolidation consistent with pneumonia secondary to septic
embolus. He required mechanical ventilation with pressure
support on the ARDSnet protocol.  His renal status worsened and
he was started on CVVH. He developed a rash which was biopsied
and was thought to likely be septic vasculitis.
He was referred to cardiac surgery after a cardiac
catheterization and underwent an aortic valve replacement with
an [**Doctor Last Name **] 27-mm pericardial tissue valve ,Debridement of left
aortic annular abscess with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**11-20**].CROSS-CLAMP
TIME:70minutes.PUMP TIME:88 minutes. Aortic Valve OR culture=
(+)Enterococcus. He was transferred to the CVICU in fair
condition on titrated milrinone, levophed, vasopressin and
propofol drips.  He underwent CVVHD to help remove fluid.  By
post-operative day three enough fluid was removed that he was
able to be extubated.  His chest tubes and epicardial wires were
removed per protocol.  A PICC was placed and he was transferred
to the surgical step down floor.  The infectious disease service
recommended that he complete 6 weeks of ampicillin and
ceftriaxone from the day of surgery-last day [**2144-1-1**]. The
remainder of his postoperative course was essentially
uneventful. He continued to progress and was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]
for discharge to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on POD#9.All follow up
appointments were advised.
