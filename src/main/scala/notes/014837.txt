Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lisinopril / Losartan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
right sided facial and right arm tingling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation [**3-31**]
extubation [**4-3**]

History of Present Illness:
55F with Hx of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%) with
BiV ICD (replaced generator on [**2128-2-26**]), progressive mitral
regurgitation, HTN, HL, obesity, presenting with acute onset of
tingling on the right side of her face and right arm. Associated
with some lightheadedness. Denies HA, blurry vision, numbness,
or weakness. No CP or palpitations.
.
She stated that she has had similar symptoms of right-sided
tingling in the recent past, but was not seen by a physician at
that time. One day prior to admission she was on the toilet
having a BM when she passed out and was found by a family member
with her head leaning on the wall.  She did not fall from the
toilet seat.  She had no CP or palpitations prior to her fall,
but it is unknown if there was head trauma. In addition, she has
felt as though she was going to pass out multiple times in last
few days. During these episodes she would feel "startled .. as
if electricity went through  her face .. as if she went far ..
far away" but did not actually pass out or lose consciousness.
She is worried that these symptoms are due to a problem with her
pacer as the generator was recently changed.
.
Per a Cardiology/EP visit on [**3-8**], the patient reported
passing on on [**2-28**] in front of a friend and woke up after
the device had shocked her.  On [**3-4**], she had another episode
of VT/VF at a rate of 250 beats per minute at 1:30 in the
morning. The ICD delivered ATP therapy which failed followed by
a 34 joule shock which terminated the arrhythmia. There were
three nonsustained VT episodes that were concurrent with the
previous two VT/VF episodes.  The device has been atrially
sensing/ventricularly sensing 1.5%, atrially
sensing/ventricularly pacing 93.3%, and atrially
pacing/ventricularly pacing 5.2% of other time.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.5 78 128/77 18 94%. She was
observed to be confused at times.  Neurology consult was
requested with the conclusion that her transient disorientation
was not neurologic in etiology but rather cardiac. EP
interrogated pacemaker and found 12 episodes of VT/VF.  On
[**2128-3-31**] given Acetaminophen 1000mg, Valsartan 80mg, Omeprazole
20mg, Torsemide 80 mg, Spironolactone 25mg, Carvedilol 25mg.
She remained in the ED overnight, and was transferred to the
floor mid-day [**3-31**].  During her time in the ED she complained of
episodes of right-sided tingling.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient denies chest pain or
palpitations.  She complains of mild tingling around her right
eye.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems
is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Microbiology:

Imaging:
CT head [**2128-3-30**]
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or
large acute territorial infarction. There are moderate,
confluent hypodensities in the centra semiovale and
periventricular white matter, consistent with sequelae of
chronic small vessel disease. There is no fracture or suspicious
bony lesion.  There is no large scalp subgaleal hematoma. The
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.

CXR [**2128-3-30**]
FINDINGS: There is severe cardiomegaly and moderate vascular
congestion, but no pulmonary edema. ICD/Pacemaker leads end in
the right atrium and right ventricle and coronary sinus,
unchanged from [**2128-2-24**].

CXR [**2128-3-31**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
increased in general lung density, likely to reflect pulmonary
edema after cardiac failure. Presence of a small pleural
effusion cannot be excluded. There is evidence of retrocardiac
atelectasis. The patient has been intubated, the endotracheal
tube projects 3 cm above the carina with its tip. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax or other complication.

CXR [**2128-4-1**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the
carina. The
transparency of the lung parenchyma has increased, likely
reflecting improved ventilation. Unchanged retrocardiac
atelectasis. The course of the nasogastric tube is constant.
Unchanged left pectoral pacemaker.

CXR [**4-2**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-1**], the monitoring
and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is
continu
