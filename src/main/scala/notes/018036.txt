Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, extubation

History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 yo woman with PMH significant for MELD 20
EtOH cirrhosis c/b esophageal varices, encephalopathy, and
ascites, EtOH abuse with history of DTs, and asthma admitted to
the MICU for hematemesis. The patient woke this morning with and
found blood coming from her mouth. The patient also notes
diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache. The patient was found in
the field to be confused with a bottle of alcohol and unable to
provide a history. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Of note, the
patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 31378**] for shortness
of breath secondary to a large pleural effusion, EtOH withdrawl,
alchohol hepatitis, and acute on chronic pancreatitis.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 137/77, HR 92-100, RR 20-30, 99% on face
mask. The patient was intubated for airway protection. An OGT
revealed 5cc of bright red blood and the patient was guaiac
positive. Octreotide and PPI were started. Hepatology was
consulted. Pt was given vanco and pip/tazo over concern for
right lung field white out and ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis.
The patient was then transferred to the MICU for further
management.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain.

Studies:
CTH: no significant change from prior study or acute process.
.
Chest Xray: Large right sided pleural effusion compared to the
xray from recent admission that had small pleural effusion
on....
2nd x-ray; ET Tube in place.
.
CT Abdomen/pelvis [**8-4**]:
1. Diffuse thickening of mucosal folds throughout the jejunum.
Although thickened folds may be seen from portal hypertension,
usually the right colon shows the most prominent fold thickening
in that scenario. Findings may accordingly be more consistent
with an infectious or inflammatory process. Hemorrhage and
ischemia are felt less likely particularly given selective
jejunal involvement, but please correlate with INR, platelets
and recent clinical course. The major mesenteric arteries and
veins are not optimally assessed, but appear patent. Please
correlate with clinical findings.
2. Known cirrhosis of the liver with small amount of free
peritoneal fluid.
3. Right moderate pleural effusion.
.
US abdomen [**2182-8-1**]
Limited Doppler study due to bowel gas establishing patent left
and right portal veins with a new hepatofugal flow.
Cirrhotic-appearing liver with minimal ascites and right pleural
effusion as well as borderline splenomegaly.
.
EGD [**3-28**]:
4 cords of grade 1 varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach
compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy
Abnormal mucosa in the duodenum. 2 small nonbleeding ulcers were
seen
in duodenum.
.
EGD [**2-25**]:
Mosaic pattern; erythematous in the fundus and body compatible
with congestive gastropathy (biopsy)
Ulcers in the duodenal bulb
Polyps in the duodenal bulb and second portion of duodenum
(biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 yo woman with PMH significant EtOH
cirrhosis c/b esophageal varices, encephalopathy, and ascites,
hepato hydrothorax, EtOH abuse, asthma admitted for questionable
hematemesis and was found to have E.coli ESBL UTI transferred
out from MICU on [**2182-8-10**] now with improved mental status.
.
ALCOHOL HEPATITIS/Cirrhosis: Given AST:ALT ratio >2:1, this was
likely secondary to EtOH cirrhosis. Discriminant function of
decreased from 60s->49->51. Her LFTs and t bili trended down to
ALT/AST 41/88 (from 60/155 on admission) and tbili 6.7 (from
12.2 on admission). She was continued lactulose and ursodiol,
and started rifaxamin [**8-14**].  She was also restarted on
diuretics, spirolactone 100mg and lasix 40mg Qday on [**8-15**].  She
was on SBP prophylaxis with meropenem which was transitioned to
nitrofurantoin ([**8-19**]).  At time of discharge her MELD was 20.
.
CHANGE MS: Pt was lethargic in the first 3 days of admission.
She was on CIWA protocol and on dilaudid IV, both were d/ced
given that patient was lethargic. As per addiction nurse who has
