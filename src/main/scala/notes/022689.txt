.
[**12-7**]: CXR- IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal placement of ETT. The tube should be pulled back
at least 4-5 cm. 2. Suboptimal placement of right internal
jugular line. The line could be pulled back at least 5.5 cm. 3.
Decreased aeration of the lungs, right upper lobe in particular,
Repeat chest x-ray following endotracheal tube repositioning
recommended.
.
[**12-7**]: Noncontrast Head CT: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the
brain with ventricular catheter and aneurysmal clip again
identified. Stable periventricular changes related to small
vessel ischemia. No acute findings.
.
[**12-7**]: CXR- IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pneumonia. 2. Mild
congestive heart failure. 3. The ETT should be pulled back 4 cm.
.
[**12-8**]: CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1. No source
identified for large hematocrit drop. Findings conveyed to Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6137**] at the time the study was performed. 2.
Multifocal areas of consolidation in both lungs. Findings appear
more than simple atelectasis, and could be due to pneumonia,
including atypical sources. Small bilateral effusions, right
greater than left. 3. CT evidence of bronchomalacia. This was
not a designated tracheal CT for full assessment, but there
appears to be severe malacic change involving the right main
stem bronchus and to a lesser degree, of the carina. 4.
Endotracheal tube tip at level of carina. This should be
repositioned. The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
7:15 p.m. on [**2108-12-8**]. 5. VP shunting tubing coiled in
right upper quadrant posterior to liver.
.
[**12-8**]: CXR- FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from
[**2108-12-7**]. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and
right-sided venous catheter are unchanged in position. The
patient is markedly rotated on the study which limits
evaluation. Allowing this, however, there are remained opacity
within the right upper lobe consistent with the upper lobe
collapse. Allowing for differences in the patient positioning,
this is relatively stable. The left lung is clear.
.
[**12-9**]: CXR- FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube tip is 2 cm above
the carina. There is right upper lobe volume loss with fluid in
the right major fissure and mediastinal shift to the right. The
right IJ line with tip in the right atrium is again visualized.
Patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe is again seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions layering posteriorly are again
visualized.
.
[**12-10**]: CXR- IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-10**] at
12:00 noon:
ET tube has been withdrawn to the mid trachea, standard
placement. There is still significant the right upper lobe
atelectasis and fullness in the right lower paratracheal region
of the mediastinum and right hilus that should be followed to
document clearing. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
unchanged. Heart is normal size. No pneumothorax. Nasogastric
tube passes into the stomach and I reviewed. Right internal
jugular line tip projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.
.
[**12-11**]: CXR- IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-7**] through
11: Consolidation and volume loss in the right upper lobe and
right infrahilar consolidation has not improved since [**12-9**] and there is now mild edema and a small volume of bilateral
pleural effusion. Heart size is top normal. ET tube is in
standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm
and out of view. Tip of the right jugular line projects over the
SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
[**12-12**]: CXR- IMPRESSION: Left-sided PICC line within the left
internal jugular vein. No other significant cardiopulmonary
changes compared to the film from three hours prior.
.
[**12-14**]: CXR- IMPRESSION: The ET tube tip is 6-cm above the
carina. The NG tube passes below the diaphragm and terminates
out of the field-of-view. The left PICC line tip terminates in
the left subclavian vein. The VP shunt is again noted. The
previously demonstrated right internal jugular vein catheter has
been removed in the meantime interval. There is no change in the
partial right upper lobe atelectasis as well as in the right
lower lobe/right middle lobe atelectasis. There is increase in
bilateral layering pleural effusions.
.
[**12-15**]: CXR- IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-12**] and
through 15.
