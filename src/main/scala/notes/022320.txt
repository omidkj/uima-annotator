History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9480**] is an 82 year-old lady with a history of malignant
B-cell lymphoma, diabetes, and frequent UTIs who was admitted
with a two day history of nausea and diarrhea.
.
In the ED, the patient's vital signs were VS: T 96.6, BP 102/43,
P 90, R 16, O2 100% on 3L (99% on 2L). She had a CT abdomen
performed, which did not show any acute pathology. She was found
to have a leukocytosis to 18K, which decreased to 13.3 with
IVFs. She was also found to have a K of 6.3, for which she was
given Insulin and glucose (the patient refused Kayexelate). U/A
was grossly positive for UTI. ECG showed T wave flattening. She
was started on Cipro and Flagyl for possible colitis and was
admitted to OMED for further evaluation.
.
On the floor, pt is pleasant and comfortable. She states she
called the ambulance from home because she felt weak. No fall.
Unable to detail further. Per records, patient came from
extended care facility, not home. She states that she had no
problems with Rituxan but did have diarrhea after bendamustine,
including diarrhea and memory loss. She notes that she has
"difficulty expressing myself." She has some nausea now and has
dry heaves where the vomit "sticks in my throat, but doesn't
come up." She also complains of diffuse abdominal pain that is
in a "different place every day." Morphine helps and it is worse
with certain foods but she is unable to detail which foods
exacerbate the pain. Pt also complains of SOB x 1 year but is
unable to elaborate further when asked with open and closed end
questions. Finally, she has an itch on her back, which she was
told is a fungal infection.

She denied headache, constipation and  fevers. She has lost
20-25 pounds but does not know over how long.


Past Medical History:
1. Malignant Lymphoma: She was treated with whole body radiation
in [**2129**] and because of a recurrence she  had a course of Rituxan
which ended on [**2164-5-1**]. A follow up PET scan in [**Month (only) **]
[**2163**] revealed that all of the FDG avid areas were no longer
visible.
During her visit of [**2167-6-29**] she was noted to have
bilateral
supraclavicular adenopathy.  On [**7-14**] a biopsy was performed
which showed:
Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, follicular center cell type, grade
II/III, predominantly follicular pattern (see note).She was seen
in consultation by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who recommended 4 treatments
with Rituxan and then re-evaluation. This was completed  on
[**2167-9-9**] she had a restaging PET scan on [**2167-10-5**]
which showed:
1. Marked overall improvement, with near-resolution of FDG-avid
lymphadenopathy. Residual avid sub-centimeter left
supraclavicular node.
2. No other FDG-avid node in chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
3. Decrease of FDG-avidity of the right parotid gland diffusely;
may reflect residual of inflammatory parotitis.
.
She completed four cycles of Bendamustine for her non hodgkins
lymphoma. A PET scan done on [**2168-8-15**] and it shows:

1. No new foci of FDG-avidity concerning for metastatic disease
compared to the prior study.
2. Interval resolution of FDG-avid foci in the liver and right
lower neck.
3. Interval decrease in FDG-avidity in the indeterminant focus
in
the lower left neck.
4. Interval resolution of FDG-avidity in the right temple and
bilateral parotid glands.
5. Moderate size hiatal hernia, unchanged.
.
2. Insulin Dependent Diabetes: She used to attend a [**Hospital 982**]
Clinic at the [**Hospital6 33**] but recently has been
managing
it by herself.
3. Hypothyroidism: On thyroid replacement with no problems
4. Spinal Stenosis: Has been seen in the pain clinic and
epidural
steroid injections have relieved her pain to a substantial
degree
in the past but recent injections have been less successful
5. Dyspnea: Interstitial Lung Disease followed by pulmonary
6. Hypertension: Controlled with medication
7. Frequent UTIs
8. Hyperlipidemia
