Admission Date:  [**2125-7-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2125-7-7**]


Service:  [**Hospital **] Medical

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers and hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old man
with complicated past medical history including coronary
artery disease, status post MI, CHF with an EF of
approximately 35%, history of seizure disorder, cerebral
palsy and mild mental retardation, who was referred from the
[**Hospital6 459**] for evaluation after he was noted to have
fevers, be hypotensive with increased lethargy and guaiac
positive stools.  The patient was noted to have fevers
approximately one day prior to admission and was noted to be
hypotensive the morning of admission.  He also apparently was
noted to have loose guaiac positive stools on that morning.
Of note, the patient is status post prolonged hospital stay
at the [**Hospital1 69**] from [**2125-5-8**] to
[**2125-5-25**] for gallstone pancreatitis status post ERCP with
sphincterotomy and stone removal.  At that time he required
temporary ICU stay for hypotension and possibly sepsis.
However, he responded well to IV fluids and antibiotics.  He
was slow to resume po intake and was maintained on TPN for
some time.  During that stay there was a question of Heparin
induced thrombocytopenia, although Heparin dependent
antibodies were later to be determined as negative.  In the
Emergency Room upon this presentation, his vitals were as
follows:  Temperature 99.8, blood pressure 85/60, heart rate
101, respiratory rate 18 with oxygen saturation of 95% on
three liters.  He was bolused with two liters of IV fluids
but remained hypotensive.  He was, at that time, started on
Dopamine at 7.5 mcg and required neo as he became acutely
hypertensive.  He was then given further fluids and admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As follows: Cerebral palsy, mild
mental retardation, history of polio with left upper
extremity and left lower extremity hemiparesis, coronary
artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2115**],
congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction, EF of
35%, lone AF in 5/00, history of seizure disorder, secondary
hypoparathyroidism, history of Barrett's esophagus with
stricture status post periodic dilation, history of
aspiration pneumonia in the setting of esophageal stricture,
history of MRSA pneumonia in 5/00, status post ileocecectomy
in [**2122**], status post right CHR, SBO status post lysis of
adhesions in 5/00, history of open cholecystectomy, history
of gallstone pancreatitis as noted in HPI, osteopenia with
compression fracture, asthma, cataracts.

MEDICATIONS:  At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Digoxin
0.25 mg alternating with 0.125 mg po q d, Diltiazem 30 mg po
q 6 hours, Lasix 20 mg po q d, Neurontin 600 mg po tid,

ALLERGIES:  Dilantin, Capoten and shellfish.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident.  He
Has a niece who lives in [**Location 8985**], [**State 3914**].  He can
transfer with assist into a wheelchair.  He is normally
independent with medication but needs assistance with
toileting.  Code status is full.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General, he was a lethargic appearing
elderly man in no acute distress.  His vitals were
temperature 97.3, blood pressure 89/47, pulse 99, respiratory
rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% on non rebreather, on 40 mcg
per minute of Neo.  His HEENT exam was significant for a
surgical pupil on the left, minimally reactive on the right.
His oropharynx was dry without lesions.  His neck was supple
with no JVD or lymphadenopathy.  His lungs had coarse breath
sounds bilaterally with crackles at the bases and rhonchorous
upper airway sounds.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was
soft, distended, diffusely tender, especially in the right
upper quadrant with mild periumbilical pain and a 3 by 3 cm
incisional hernia which was easily reducible and nontender.
Extremities had left upper extremity and left lower extremity
with contractures.  On neurologic exam he had a left
hemiparesis.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, WBC 10.7, hematocrit 33.3,
platelet count 55,000, coags with PT 13.1, INR 1.1, PTT 28.6,
sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 106, CO2 17, BUN 49,
creatinine 4.4, up from a baseline of approximately 0.8,
glucose 96.  Initial CK was 889 but an MB of 12.  Troponin
was less than 0.3.  Urinalysis showed large amount of
leukocyte esterase, small blood, many bacteria, 15 whites, 2
reds, 0 epis.  Chest x-ray was rotated and showed mild CHF
but no obvious infiltrate.  His EKG was sinus tachycardia at
108 with borderline PR prolongation, left axis deviation,
borderline left anterior fascicular block, ST depressions of
1 mm in V4 through V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit given his pressor requirement for blood
pressure support.

1.  Cardiac:  The patient was initially noted to have
elevated CKs, however, the MB fraction was low.  He had
negative troponins.  A rule out MI protocol was followed and
serial CKs did not show evidence of myocardial infarction.
Repeat EKGs did not show changes.  As such, it was felt that
this was not cardiac in nature.  As the patient's status
improved, his outpatient cardiac regimen was restarted.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was noted to have bilateral
wheezing which resolved with Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.  He
has a known history of asthma.  He also had coarse upper
airway breath sounds.  Chest x-ray was not consistent with
pneumonia, however, during this hospitalization there was a
question of possible microaspiration.  As such, it may be
reasonable to thicken the patient's liquids until a full
speech and swallow evaluation can be performed.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  Although guaiac positive stools were
documented at the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, no such stools were
documented at the [**Hospital1 69**].
Thus, the differential is quite large including ischemic
colitis, diverticulitis, infectious colitis or other sources
of colonic or upper GI bleeding.  Given the patient's rapid
turnaround and non elevated LDH, ischemic colitis was thought
to be unlikely.  This, instead, may have represented an
infectious colitis which spontaneously resolved or may
represent other source of gastrointestinal bleeding which is
intermittent.  As such, it may be reasonable to perform
outpatient colonoscopy in the future to further evaluate.

4.  Infectious Disease:  Given the patient's urinary analysis
and urinary cultures, it was thought that the patient most
likely suffered from urosepsis.  As such, Levofloxacin and
Vancomycin were initially started given his history of MRSA
colonization.  The cultures returned indicating MRSA and as
such, antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin alone.  The
patient responded well to this therapy and on [**2125-7-5**] was
transferred to the floor for further management.  A midline
IV was placed for completion of a 10 day course of Vancomycin
for treatment of his MRSA urosepsis.

5.  Renal:  Initially the patient was noted to have an
elevated creatinine of 5.5.  With the treatment of his
urosepsis and maintaining his blood pressure, his creatinine
returned back down to his baseline of 0.7 by time of
discharge.  As such, the patient's ACE inhibitor was
restarted without difficulty.

6.  Musculoskeletal:  During this admission the patient's CKs
were noted to rise, peeking at 1,819 with a negative MB
fraction.  It is not clear whether this CK leak came from at
time of discharge.  Most likely a musculoskeletal source,
however, by treating his underlying infection, the situation
resolved and CKs were trending down by time of discharge.

By [**2125-7-7**] the patient was ready for discharge to the [**Hospital6 46219**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Digoxin 0.25 mg alternating with
0.125 mg po q d, Diltiazem 30 mg po q 6 hours, Neurontin 600
