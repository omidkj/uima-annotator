Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVL placement and removal.


History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 yo M with a past medical history significant for
multiple myeloma (gets care at DF), on dexamethasone, who
presents to the ED today with complaints of weakness and fatigue
for several days. He does not endorse any localizing symptoms,
but notes that he is "not feeling well" and feels weak. He
describes that he had a near syncopal event yesterday. He
describes that he was about to leave his home and suddenly fell.
He did not have his walker with him. He endorses a prodrome of
lightheadedness and felt "woozy" but denies loss of
consciousness.  He did scrape his right knee and side of the
face a little bit. He saw his gerontologist the same day, but
felt better by that time. He describes possible fever/chills at
home, but did not measure his temperature. He denies any n/v/d,
sick contacts, myalgias, chest pain, palpitations or headache.
He is complaining about severe sweating that occurs at night
without any reason for which he had a work up at the VA that was
unrevealing.



Upon arrival to the ED, initial vital signs were 98.2 80 80/43
20 98% on room air. Tmx was 99.7. Exam was nonlocalizing with a
benign abdominal exam. His lactate was 1.3, but labs were
otherwise significant for a leukocytosis to 26,000 with a left
shift, acute renal failure with a creatine of 2.3. He had a
normal cxr, neg UA.  Blood/urine cx were drawn and he was given
3L of NS with little improvement in his blood pressure. ECG was
without acute change, and a troponin was elevated at 0.44,
prompting a cardiology consult who advised that this was likely
in the setting of ARF and hypotension and was not ACS. He was
given an aspirin. At this time, the concern for relative adrenal
insufficiency was raised and he was given a dose of stress dose
hydrocortisone, with subsequent improvement in his BP to 88/39.
He was mentating clearly throughout.



He is being admitted to the MICU for hypotension. At time of
transfer to the MICU, his vitals were 73 88/39 20 96%ra, but he
subsequently dropped his pressures to the 60??????s. A CVL was
placed, he was started on levophed and given a dose of vanco,
CTX and flagyl. He now has a CVL and 2 18g PIV's for access, and
has been started on his 4th L NS.



Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient is alert and talkative. He
feels ??????better??????. He notes that he always has some amount of
shortness of breath, and although he appears somewhat
breathless, he will not endorse that this is any worse from his
baseline. He denies pleuritic chest pain, palpitiations.

CXR ([**2-16**]): Persistent CHF, slightly worse when compared to
[**2159-2-15**].
.
CT C/A/P:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the
right, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
2. No source for sepsis identified on CT of the chest, abdomen,
and pelvis.
3. Multiple renal cysts, measuring up to 11 cm on the right and
4 cm on the left, containing simple fluid. A smaller 14-mm
exophytic cyst along the upper pole of the right kidney, is
slightly hyperdense, possibly representing proteinaceous
material or blood products, although a solid lesion cannot be
excluded without administration of IV contrast.
4. Status post cholecystectomy.
5. Scattered colonic diverticula without evidence of
diverticulitis.
6. Mild prostatic enlargement.
7. Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
8. Multilevel compression fractures in the thoracolumbar spine
of indeterminate chronicity, status post kyphoplasty at two
levels. No associated soft tissue component is noted along the
spine.
9. Possible non-displaced acute/subacute lateral right 9th rib
fracture.
.
CARDIAC ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. Mild to moderate ([**1-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen, but technical study
quality precludes definite asssessment of valvular morphology.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Preserved biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with history of MM, DVT, admitted with hypotension and
ARF.
.
MICU COURSE: He was admitted to the MICU for hypotension. At
time of transfer to the MICU, his vitals were 73 88/39 20 96%ra,
but he subsequently dropped his pressures to the 60??????s. A CVL was
placed, he was started on levophed and given a dose of vanco,
CTX and flagyl. Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient was alert
and talkative. He received stress dose steroids out of concern
for AI in the setting of chronic dx use. He was started on
Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro for ? infiltrate in retrocardiac space. He
received volume resuscitation with 8 liters and subsequently
developed bilateral pleural effusions. He was briefly on bipap
overnight for 5 minutes because patient appeared uncomfortable,
but no clinical change. A CT c/a/p showed bilateral renal cyst,
for which he has urology f/u.
On transfer to floor, he felt better. He notes that he always
has some amount of shortness of breath, and although he appears
somewhat breathless, he will not endorse that this is any worse
from his baseline. He denies pleuritic chest pain,
palpitiations.
.
HYPOTENSION: Patient had mild fever and leukocytosis but no
localizing symptoms. Hypotension was originally fluid refractory
but responded to steroids. CT C/A/P showed no evidence of
infection. UA negative. Cardiac Echo did not point to a cardiac
