History of Present Illness:
This is a 50 year-old man with past medical history of
hypertension, OSA who presented to emergency department after
being found on park bench by EMS intoxicated. He was somnolent
but arousable at that time.
.
Patient brought to the emergency department around 1AM [**7-1**],
somnolent but arousable. History obtained at that time included
night sweats, fevers, hemoptysis and chills. He was found to
have ETOH level of 253. CXR demonstrated bibasilar opacities.
The ED planned originally to allow patient to sober, treat for
pneumonia and re-evaluate.
.
However, on re-evaluation later on [**7-1**] morning, patient remained
somnolent and was noted to intermittently drop his oxygen
saturation to the high 80's while sleeping. The oxygen
saturation returned to [**Location 213**] levels with arousal. Fever to 102
at 7:30AM. Further work-up initiated and has included two sets
of negative cardiac enzymes, cbc, chem-10, coags, serum and
urine tox as well as chest x-ray and CTA. Work up remarkable for
mildly elevated acetaminophen level of 10.2 and CT findings
consisting of multifocal ground glass opacities with mediastinal
and hilar lymphadenopathy.
.
The patient was given levoquin 750mg IV x 1, one liter normal
saline and placed on respiratory precautions.
.
When seen the patient reports that after traveling to [**Location (un) 9012**]
last week he developed 3-4 days of productive cough, night
sweats, fevers and chills. Generally feeling week. Associated
shortness of breath, no chest pain. Says he remembers drinking a
pint of vodka and 40 ounces of beer and then was feeling very
weak last night and asked police to take him to the hospital. He
doesn't recall other events last night after becoming
intoxicated.
.
He was observed in the ICU as he sobered up. He was maintained
on resp precaution. SPutum sample was obtained to r/o TB. He was
started on ABX for CAP.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2133-7-2**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2133-7-2**]):
      GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha
streptococcus or
         Lactobacillus sp.
.
EKG [**2133-7-1**]:
Sinus rhythm. Anterolateral ST segment changes are suggestive of
ischemia. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2133-7-1**]
There are no comparison studies on record. There is no evidence
of significant soft tissue injury and no underlying skull
fracture is identified. There may be a small osteoma involving
the left paramedian occiput. The included portions of the
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells, as well as the middle
ear cavities are clear. There is no intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage. The midline structures are in the midline and the
ventricles and cisterns are normal in size and in contour. A
small, approximately 1.9 cm relatively hyperattenuating focus in
the right superolateral aspect of the posterior fossa is
identified on a single section (2:8) and likely represents
partial volume averaging of the tentorium; no similar focus is
identified elsewhere. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
maintained, throughout, without no evidence of cerebral edema.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2133-7-1**]
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no
filling defects present within the pulmonary vasculature that
are consistent with pulmonary embolism. Incidental note is made
of an anomalous, left-sided pulmonary vein draining the left
upper lobe. The heart and great vessels are otherwise
unremarkable. There is no pericardial effusion. The pulmonary
artery is prominent measuring 3.1 cm in diameter. There is an
enlarged prevascular lymph node measuring 21 x 12 mm (3:31).
There is an enlarged right hilar lymph node measuring 18 x 15 mm
(3:40). There are several other smaller precarinal and
subcarinal lymph nodes. There are no pathologic axillary lymph
nodes. There are diffuse, patchy bilateral ground glass
opacities within all lobes of the lung. There are higher density
focal patchy areas of consolidation present within the left
lower lobe. There are emphysematous changes, most prominent in
the right upper lobe. There are no pleural effusions. No
pulmonary nodules are identified. The airways are patent to the
level of the segmental bronchi.
Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal patchy areas of ground glass opacity and
consolidation in the setting of mediastinal and right hilar
lymphadenopathy. Infectious etiologies including bacterial,
viral, and other atypical infections, in addition to
tuberculosis (less likely) should be considered. Emphysematous
changes most prominent at the right lung apex. Repeat
examination in [**5-1**] weeks is recommended to confirm resolution.
