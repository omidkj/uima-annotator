[**2106-8-16**] CT Head : There is interval increase of the bilateral

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 57100**] is a 52 year old male who was found down and
unresponsive at
the prison. He was transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital and scans
revealed a subarachnoid hemorhage. He was intubated and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Serial CT scans show enlarging
intracerebral hemorrhage in the presence of elevated INR and low
platelet count. The patient was admitted to the Surgical ICU
where his coagulopathy was corrected with FFP, platelets and
clotting factors.

On [**8-16**], The patient was able to eye open spontaneously,pupils
are equal and reactive, +corneals,+cough,+gag.  The patient
flexes bilaterally upper extremities, the patient withdraws
bilaterally in teh lower extremities.  The patient did not
follow commands.

On [**8-17**], The patient was placed on mannitol every six hours with
holding parameters for serum osmoality > 320. The patient
continued on 3% saline at 30 cc/hr. In the morning the serum
sodium was 125 and the goal was 135.  renal/hepatology
consultations were placed. A NCHCT was performed which was found
to be unchanged.  The lactate 11.3.  Continuous dialysis was
initiated per the renal service.  The corrected dilantin level
was 8.7 and the patient was given a Dilantin bolus of 500 mg IV
dilantin.  An echocardiogram was performed and was consistent
with vegetation on the aortic valve and a cardiology
consultation was placed. Infectious disease was consulted for
findinh noted on teh echocardiogram.   The patient continued
vanccomycin/flagyl/micafungin for broad spectrum coverage for
pneumonia and aortic vegetation. Over the evening hours the
patient's lactate began to elevate to 11 and his renal function
deteriotated. He was placed on CVVH. Given the evidence of
progressive multiorgan failure the decision was made n
conjunction with family to begin withdrawal of care.

On [**8-18**] the patient's blood pressure drifted down off pressors
and he passed.
