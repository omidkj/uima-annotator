History of Present Illness:
59 year old female with mental retardation, anemia, ileus and
volvulus s/p resection and recent hospitalization with
pericardial effusion and new mediastinal mass with diffuse
lymphadenopathy presents with recurrent tachypnea and increased
oxygen requirement. Patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]
approximately one week ago back to her group home. During her
last hospitalization she was found to have a pericardial
effusion with evidence of  tamponade and this was drained. She
then developed a-fib with RVR that was suppressed with verapamil
and metoprolol. She was also noted to have a large mediastinal
mass and diffuse lymphadenopathy.  Pericardial fluid and lymph
node FNA both did not show clear evidence of malignancy. She was
discharged to her group home acute care facility and recommended
to have entire excision of her egg-sized left axillary lymph
node for further diagnosis.

She now represents with tachypnea and increased oxygen
requirement. At her home she was noted to be more tachypnic with
slightly increased O2 requirement. She has needed intermittent
oxygen and occasionally refuses it. The patient has history of
tachypnea during her last hospitalization that resolved with
sitting up (may have been mechanical from her large
abdomen/ileus) and with nebulizer treatments. At
[**Hospital3 1196**] ED she received solumedrol 125mg once,
sasix 20mg IV once, zosyn 1 dose.  CTA chest showed no evidence
of PE, small bilateral pleural effusion, moderate pericardial
effusion and large mediastinal mass encasing and narrowing the
SVC, extensive lymphadenopathy. No comment was made on a
consolidation. She was in normal sinus rhythm and had a negative
first set of cardiac enzymes. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

History is difficult to obtain from the patient. She often says
yes to all questions. When asked if she has pain, she does point
to her distended abdomen and to her chest.
