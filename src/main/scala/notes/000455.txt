Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was seen in the ER and ultrasound revealed that he had a
right IJ thrombus, and that the tip of the Permacath was in the
right IJ.  This is despite having an admission INR of 2.8.  He
was admitted for work-up of the thrombus and possible resiting
of the dialysis line.
  On HD #2, patient went to IR for venography to delineate the
extent of thrombus and catheter position, as well as to look for
central stenoses or other reasons for his failed left arm AV
graft and new clot in right system.  IR found an occlusion of
the right subclavian/brachiocephalic, performed angioplasty of
the presumed thrombus and left a venous sheath in place for TPA
thrombolysis with the intention of follow-up venography on HD
#3.  Incidentally, the Permacath was seen to be in good
position.  Subsequent to this, discussion between Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
and the patient's nephrologist concluded that the risk of
bleeding outweighed the possible benefit of thrombolysis;  TPA
administration was stopped.
  On HD #3, the patient had his sheath removed, was dialyzed
successfully through the Permacath and he was discharged home.
