Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
L MCA stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tPA administration


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 112027**] is an 81-year-old probably right-handed woman
presenting with the above on a background of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, not anticoagulated, likely coronary artery
disease,
end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.

Per OSH notes, the patient woke and went to the bathroom at
about
7 AM. Shortly afterward, she was found slumped on the toilet,
was
found to be mute and with a right hemiplegia. She was taken to
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where stroke was suspected. Non-contrast head CT
did not reveal hemorrhage, and tPA was started at 9:30 AM. She
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], arriving at 10:50. She likely got
about 20 cc too much tPA - it was still running during transport
and was supposed to be stopped at 10:30, but was stopped on
arrival at 10:50.

At baseline she is ambulatory with a walker and is "A&Ox3".

Review of systems was not possible.

Past Medical History:
- ICD placement, about 10 days ago
- Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on Coumadin (patient
apparently refused), also ventricular pauses per call-in
- ESRD on hemodialysis, percutaneous right chest line
- On Plavix, presumed coronary disease
- Possible further medical history
- Hypertension (on arrival and on dialysis, so probable)
- Prednisone taper for unknown reason (husband says no oxygen or
inhalers at home, so this will need to be verified)

Social History:
Lives with her husband. Further not obtainable.

Family History:
Not obtainable.

REPORTS:

CT/CTA [**2106-6-8**]: IMPRESSION:
1.  Left MCA infarction.  No evidence of hemorrhage.
2.  Focal ulceration at the origin of the right common carotid
artery.
3.  Extensive atherosclerosis involving the arotic arch, left
common carotid
artery, and carotid bifurcations.

CXR [**2106-6-9**]: IMPRESSION:  Moderate right pleural effusion.
Retrocardiac opacity may represent pneumonia, atelectasis or
other pulmonary process.

ECHO [**2106-6-9**]: Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
interatrial septum is aneurysmal. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is considerable beat-to-beat
variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an
irregular rhythm/premature beats. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. No evidence
of left atrial mass/thrombus although TTE cannot exclude this.
If clinically indicated, a TEE will better assess for LAA
thrombus.

CT HEAD [**2106-6-9**]: IMPRESSION:
1.  Extensive cytotoxic edema and hyperdensity throughout the
left MCA
distribution, in an evolving territorial infarct.  This likely
represents
abnormal parenchymal enhancement (related to the contrast given
for the CTA,roughly 17 hours earlier), in the setting of
blood-brain barrier breakdown in the acutely ischemic brain.
2.  Old left PCA territorial infarct, with encephalomalacia.

CT HEAD [**6-11**]/!2: IMPRESSION:  Evolving left MCA infarct.  No
evidence of hemorrhage.

CXR [**2106-6-12**]: FINDINGS:  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The
dual-lead pacemaker and right supraclavicular double-lumen
catheter is again visualized.  Small left pleural effusion is
again visualized and is unchanged.  There continues to be dense
retrocardiac opacity likely due to a combination of volume loss
and effusion, although an infiltrate cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
On Admission:

[**Known firstname 8797**] [**Known lastname 112027**] is an 81 year old female with a history of
atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation, ESRD (on dialysis)
who presented as a transfer from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital for L MCA
infarct. She was brought to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital where her exam
was notable for aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis. She had a
head CT scan performed which showed an acute/subacute left MCA
distribution infarct.  Neurology evaluated the patient and she
received t-PA. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]-ICU for further
care.

On arrival she had ecchymoses/hematoma over her left chest at
the site of pacemaker placement and right upper arm (prior
bruise from fall). Compressive dressings were placed on both
these sites.

ICU course: ([**2106-6-8**]- [**2106-6-11**])

# Neuro:

CTA after tPA showed recanalized flow through the MCA however
she continued to have significant R sided weakness and
productive aphasia.

At first, her BP was allowed to autoregulate, however she went
into afib with RVR with subsequent relative hypotension
(SBP<120) and there was an empiric concern for inadequate
cerebral blood flow. She was placed on Neosynephrine and given
lopressor/digoxin to control arrhythmias. Neo was then stopped
at 48hrs and she was allowed to autoregulate once again.

Lipid profile showed an LDL of 72 and a HgA1C of 5.1.

In terms of anticoagulation for afib, she had
