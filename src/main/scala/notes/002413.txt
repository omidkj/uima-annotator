History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88028**] is a 57 year old man with h/o afib on Coumadin,
pacemaker, CAD s/p stents x2, CVA, seizures, HLD, HTN, asthma,
arthritis on NSAIDs, who was transferred from an OSH with chest
pain after choking, found to have atrial flutter, hypotension,
acute renal failure, and hematemesis.
.
The patient was in his usual state of health when he choked on
some canned tuna in the morning. He later felt fatigued and
developed substernal chest pain. He also had epigastric
discomfort. He initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] around
3pm, where he was found to be in aflutter with RVR (HR 140s). He
was given Metoprolol 5mg with subsequent hypotension (SBP 60s).
BP did not improve with 1LNS. At 6:45PM, the patient vomited a
large amount of bright red blood. NGT was placed with bloody
output. He was pale and continued to be hypotensive. Labs were
notable for WBC 19.3, HCT 35.7, INR 3.1, Cr 1.9 (baseline 0.9),
Trop I <0.06, Lactate 6.9. He was given Vitamin K 10mg SC x1,
Protonix 40mg IV, 1unit pRBCs, and 1unit FFP.
.
Of note, he has a several month h/o epigastric discomfort in the
setting of NSAID use (Aleve x years). He had an EGD 4 months ago
that was unremarkable. He continued to use NSAIDs during this
time.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.2 HR 107 BP 88/41 RR 34 O2sat
100%4LNC. The patient appeared very pale on arrival. He
continued complaining of epigastric pain. Exam notable for
pallor and abdominal distension. Labs notable for HCT 18.4, INR
3.9, Cr. 1.5. Patient was given 3units pRBCs, 1unit FFP, 2 packs
of platelets, 2LNS. Repeat HCT 24.3. Patient was seen by GI in
the ED - will hold on scope until AM given stable BP. Also had
an episode of dark red bowel movement.  Vitals prior to
transfer: HR 120 BP 116/87 RR 21 O2sat 100% *LNC.
.
On the floor, the patient was hemodynamically stable. He
complained of large amounts of gas in his abdomen. He had
another dark bloody bowel movement. No fevers, chills, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain. No h/o
GI bleeds, no known h/o cirrhosis. Does have past h/o EtOH use.

.
EKG ([**10-29**]): Atrial tachycardia or flutter with variable block.
Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. A single ventricular premature beat is noted. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CXR ([**10-29**]):  No focal consolidation. Nasogastric tube is seen
in the upper esophagus, but cannot be followed reliably into the
stomach due to underpenetration.
.
CXR ([**10-30**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
newly appeared complete left lower lobe atelectasis. In
addition, a small left pleural effusion is seen.
Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. The monitoring and
support devices
are constant. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
Unchanged absence of
parenchymal opacities in the right lung.
.
EKG ([**11-1**]): Probable atrial flutter with 4:1 block. Early R
wave progression. Since the
previous tracing of [**2117-10-31**] the ventricular rate has decreased.
Otherwise, findings are unchanged.
.
CXR ([**11-3**]): Left lower lobe aeration is improving, small left
pleural effusion stable. Upper lungs clear. Mild cardiomegaly
unchanged. ET tube and transvenous right atrial and right
ventricular pacer leads in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
.
EKG ([**11-4**]): Atrial flutter with ventricular paced rhythm. Since
the previous tracing of [**2117-11-1**] ventricular paced rhythm is now
present.
.
EKG ([**11-5**]): Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2117-11-4**]
ventricular pacing is not seen on the current tracing.
.
CXR ([**11-4**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
minimally increasing mainly perihilar opacity, potentially
reflecting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. As compared to the
previous radiograph, there has also been an increase in the
extent of the retrocardiac atelectasis. The presence of a small
left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
.
CXR ([**11-5**]): Mild pulmonary edema which developed on [**11-4**]
and perihilar consolidation in the left mid lung have both
cleared. Although the heart size is normal
there is still pulmonary vascular engorgement suggesting
elevated left atrial pressure. There is no pneumothorax or
pleural effusion. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and
out of view. Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer
leads are in standard placement.
.
EKG ([**11-7**]): Atrial flutter with controlled ventricular
response. Compared to tracing #1
ventricular response is slower.
.
