Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3063**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
86 yo male h/o CAD, CHF, COPD presents with dyspnea. Reports
cough x3 weeks, denies hemoptysis. Noted dyspnea which awoke him
from sleep on the night prior to presentation. Patient denies
chest pain, fevers and chills. Patient endorses worsening
orthopnea over past month, previously slept with 1-2 pillows now
requires 3 pillows. Has additionally experienced PND. Has not
noted swelling of his lower extremities or increased weight. His
weight on admission of 154 is down from his most recent clinic
weight of 168. He has noted swelling of his abdomen starting on
the morning of admission. He reports this swelling was present
prior to presentation in the ED and states it is not a problem
he has previously experienced.
In ED patient's initial VS were T 98.6, HR 88, 154/96, Resp 22
98% RA, patient then experienced decompensation of his
respiratory status, desaturated to 92% on room air requiring
placement on BiPAP. Patient received a CXR which showed
increased vascular congestion and questionable pneumonia.
Patient received Azithro, ceftriaxone, nebs x3 and solumedrol.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was noted to be saturating well
on BiPAP, experienced increased shortness of breath when taken
off of BiPAP.

Imaging:
CXR [**10-3**] IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular
congestion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, atypical
pneumonia could also be considered.  Also, although it is
difficult to exclude focal pneumonia at the lung bases, patchy
basilar opacities with low lung volumes could also be seen with
atelectasis.

Cardiac Echo [**2170-10-4**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
35-40 %) with regional hypokinesis in basal-mid lateral
hypo/akinesis and apical hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-8-4**],
the wall motion abnormalities and overall ejection fraction are
similar. The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased but
was probably underestimated on the prior study.
IMPRESSION: Regional wall motion abnormalities in the inferior,
lateral and apical territories with reduced ejection fraction to
30-35%. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic
regurgitation.

CXR [**2170-10-4**]
COMPARISON:  [**2170-10-3**].

FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung
volumes have
minimally increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.
Otherwise, the
radiograph is unchanged, including the pre-existing
mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions are seen.  No evidence of
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
87 year old male with productive cough x3 weeks and new onset of
dyspnea on day prior to presentation who was admitted to the
MICU originally for BIPAP and quickly weaned off of it and
transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **].

# Dyspnea: most likely represents CHF exacerbation in setting of
progressive orthopnea as well as contribution from concurrent
COPD exacerbation. Likely exacerbated by abdominal wall tension
with large amounts of bowel gas. ABG on bipap shows mild
respiratory acidosis. Patient has previous spirometry results
indicative of underlying restrictive pathology as well. His
respiratory status improved after diuresis and he was weaned off
fo Bipap and stable on NC and transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **].
On the floor he continued saturate comfortably on room air. In
addition, he was placed on steroid burst and azithromycin x 5
days for COPD flare.

# CHF: Last echo [**7-/2169**] shows LVEF of 35-40%. Patient received
repeat echo on hospital day 2 with final report pending upon
call out from ICU. Patient was continued on home CHF medications
of Diovan, metoprolol and Lasix. Echo without marked interval
change, EF 30-35%.

# Abdominal distension: KUB shows diffuse bowel gas, no air
fluid levels or signs of obstruction. Abdominal exam currently
without tenderness or rebound, not concerning for acute abdomen.
Distension preceded Bipap initiation per the patient. Patient
endorses normal BMs and continues passing some gas per rectum.
Patient received Simethicone overnight with minimal improvement
in bowel gas, also received aggres
