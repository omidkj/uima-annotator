Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 57351**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2170-3-9**] and taken to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], where he underwent an AVR w/21mm
CE tissue valve.  In the operating room his ejection fraction
was found to be 55%, with preserved biventricular systolic
funciton.  He tollerated the procedure well and was transfered
to the ICU in stable condition. He was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventillation without difficulty. His pacer was
interrogated by the EPS service and was found to be functioning
properly.  Postoperatively he had a moderate ammount of
confusion which gradulally resolved.  He was restarted on his
sotalol for beta blockade, and he was not restarted on his
coumadin as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] thought if he remained in sinus rhythm
post operatively, it would not be needed.  His telemetry
consistently showed AV pacing with a variable rate.  He was
transfered from the ICU to the regular floor on POD#6.  On POD#7
the EP service increased the lower rate of his pacer to 80.  It
was determined by the cardiac surgery team and physical therapy
that he would benifit from a stay at a short term rehab and on
POD#10, he was cleared for discharge to rehab.
