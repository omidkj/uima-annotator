pneumonia treated with Azithromycin and Levaquin.  He was
noted by the VNA to be tachycardiac on [**2201-3-5**] to the 120s
and referred to PCPs office where the PCPs EKG documented
sinus tachycardia at 130s and referred the patient to [**Hospital3 9683**] ED where a V/Q scan reportedly showed a pulmonary
embolus, questionable saddle-like on films but films were
unavailable upon transfer to [**Hospital6 2018**] Emergency Department for consideration of thrombectomy

cannula 02, speaking in full sentences, no major acute
distress.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  Moist membrane mucosa.  Neck:
Right anterior surgical site.  No oozing.  Steri-Stripped.
Prominent external jugular venous pulsations.  Heart:
Tachycardiac, regular rhythm, S1 and S2 normal.  No S3 or S4.
No rub.  Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds on the left, basilar
and also some crackles on the right basilar.  Abdomen:  Bowel
sounds present, scaphoid, nontender, nondistended, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Increased edema in the
left leg.  Trace pitting edema to the knee.  No cords.  No

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, sodium 137,
potassium 4.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 13,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 110, calcium 9.3, troponin 0.07, INR
1.2, PTT 23.6.  White blood cell count 7.3, hematocrit 40.9,
platelets 427,000.

EKG at [**Hospital1 18**] showed sinus tachycardia at 106, normal axis,
normal intervals, and no RV strain, no S1, T3, had a positive
small Q in III but no ST changes or T wave inversions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Since admitted, he was admitted to the MICU
and it was decided that instead of the thrombectomy to
actually go through anticoagulation with heparin.  He
tolerated the heparin drip well and has become
hemodynamically stable and has been off the oxygen since and
the goal was once stable transfer to the floor.  Her was
transferred to the floor without any new acute findings.
Homans sign negative.  No calf tenderness since and has
become therapeutic on Coumadin after the third day on
admission to the [**Hospital1 139**] firm.  The patient has done well
since on [**Hospital1 139**] firm and bridged to Coumadin to keep INR
level between 2 and 3.  Have already discussed follow-up INRs
with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], over the phone.  The patient will
follow-up with her tomorrow for INR checks and further
follow-up.

In terms of CAD, given that there is a possibility of
intervention, his aspirin was held to be restarted at the
PCPs office tomorrow.  Already discussed with the PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was continued on lisinopril, Lipitor meanwhile.  Also, his
beta blockers were restarted on the day of discharge.

In terms of his diabetes, continue his Amaryl and he was
getting fingersticks while in the hospital and doing well,
and was well-controlled.

In terms of seizure disorder, he is asymptomatic.  He had
Dilantin levels which were slightly subtherapeutic.  To be
continued to be checked by PCP but continue with the Dilantin
while in the hospital.

The patient tolerated p.o. intake well and was doing well,
stable, and in very good condition, good spirits upon
leaving.

The only other added note is that since he has been here he
had emphasized that he had mood changes which were consistent
with some depressive episodes.  He was started on Celexa
given that it will have less of an interaction in terms of
drug interactions with other drugs he has on board.  The
start of Celexa was discussed with his PCP and is to be
continued at her discretion.

DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged to home.  The
patient was noted to seek medical care if his symptoms worsen
or any new symptoms arise or any sign of bleeding from
anywhere.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Pulmonary embolus.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has an appointment
tomorrow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14214**], on [**2201-3-12**] at 2:45
p.m.  He will have his INR followed-up over there.  The goal
INR is [**12-30**] and consider also starting aspirin per PCPs input
and discretion.
