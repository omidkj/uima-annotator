Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, pt was initially seen by cardiac
surgery following his cardiac cath. Patient was eventually
consented for surgery and on [**2155-2-13**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 3 and aortic valve replacement. Please see op note for
surgical details. Patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU in stable condition receiving
Neo-Synephrine, Dobutamine, and Levophed drips. Later on op day
sedation was weaned and patient awoke neurologically intact. He
was then weaned from mechanical ventilation and extubated. He
was weaned from all Inotropes/Pressors on post op day one and
was then transferred to the cardiac step-down unit. B Blockers
and Diuretics were initiated and patient was gently diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. Chest tubes and Foley catheter were
removed on post op day two. And epicardial pacing wires were
removed on post op day three. Pt was followed by physical
therapy during his entire post op course for strength and
mobility. Patient had a relatively uncomplicated post op course
and was at level 5 by post op day five. His exam and labs were
stable on post op day five and he was discharged home with VNA
services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
