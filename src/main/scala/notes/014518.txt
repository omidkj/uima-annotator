Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6565**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 99932**] is an 80 year old male with history of prostatic
adenocarcinom s/p radiation in [**2097**], adrenal mass (presumed
angiomyolipoma) recently increased in size, MGUS, gastric
polyps, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation s/p CVA x
2 on coumadin, who presented to the ED on the day of admission
with c/o fatigue and dyspnea on exertion x 1 week.  He says that
he was in his usual state of health prior to this, but noted the
gradual onset of dyspnea with things he could normally do more
easily, such as walking up the stairs.  He denies any orthopnea
or PND.  He has chronic LLE edema from [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] cyst.  Denies
fevers/chills.  No melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis.  No
lightheadedness, dizziness, or vision changes.

Of note, he has had about a 20 pound weight loss over the last
few months.  Denies bone pain, denies night sweats.  His medical
history is notable for prostatic adenocarcinoma treated with
radiation in [**2097**].  His PSA nadired at 0.6 in [**2099**], but has been
rising since, with a doubling time of about 2 years.  He
recently had a bone scan that was negative.  Additionally, he
has had a known L adrenal mass since as far back as [**2100**], with
radiologic features c/w angiomyolipoma.  Recently, however, on a
CT scan from [**6-8**] the mass had been found to increase to 12 cm
in largest dimension as compared to 6 cm in [**10-7**].  An MRI of the
abdomen in [**8-8**] was consistent with hemorrhage into an
angiomyolipoma, however a CT of the abdomen just 2 weeks later
demonstrated an increase in size to 18 cm, with concern for
transformation to carcinoma.  Also demonstrated on this CT were
new scattered non-calcified b/l pulmonary nodules < 5 mm in
diameter.  A repeat abdominal MRI done at the end of [**Month (only) 205**]
confirmed the marked increase in size of the adrenal mass,
additionally demonstrating at least 4 new focal liver lesions
ranging in size from 6-8 mm.

On arrival to the ED on the day of admission, his vitals were
97.8, HR 72, BP 157/65, RR 26, 95% RA.  He appeared comfortable.
 His labs were notable for a hct of 26, down from 33 on [**8-17**], as
well as a mild leukocytosis of 14.  His INR was 2.3 (on
coumadin).  An EKG showed AF, with mild T wave flattening and
?low voltage in limb leads.  He had a CT of the abdomen which
revealed interval development of large bilateral pleural
effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis, the overall
appearance and bilateral nature of which was felt to be most c/w
failure; interval development and increase in size of numerous
pulmonary nodules, as well as a slight interval increase in the
previously described large left adrenal mass.  An NG lavage was
negative, though he was guaiac positive.  He was transfused 1 U
PRBCs, 2 U FFP, and given 40 mg IV lasix x 1 prior to transfer
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Past Medical History:
1) Chronic arthritis
2) Adenocarcinoma of the prostate in [**2097**], s/p radiation.
Adrenal myelolipoma, first noted on CT in [**2100**], relatively
stable in size until large increase from [**2104**] to [**2106**].  See
above.
3) Non-insulin dependent diabetes with peripheral neuropathy
4) Atrial fibrillation on coumadin
5) CVA x 2
6) Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance
7) Mitral regurgitation:  Last echo [**12-9**] showed EF 55%,
moderately dilated RA and LA, 1+ MR, [**2-6**]+ TR, and moderate
pulmonary systolic hypertension.
8) Gastric polyps:  Seen on EGD [**7-10**] with the appearance of
recent bleeding.  Biopsy c/w hyperplastic polyps.

Social History:
Lives alone in an apartment in [**Location (un) **].  Able to ambulate on
his own.  Doesn't get any home services, takes all of his
medications on his own.  Used to smoke but quit 50 years ago.
Used to drink socially, not much anymore.

Family History:
Mother died of breast ca at 80.  Otherwise no known cancer
history.

Physical Exam:
VS:  98.7, 66, 171/84, RR 24, 97% on 2L via NC
Gen:  Cachectic caucasian male appearing slightly tachypneic
with some accessory muscle use, but otherwise comfortable and
conversant.
Skin: Prominent seborrheic keratoses over majority of skin
surface.
HEENT:  Anicteric sclerae, moist MM.
Neck:  JVP at approx 10 cm, no bruits.
Cor: RR, normal rate, no m/r/g.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion at
both bases, mild rales just above dullness b/l.
Abd: NABS, NT.  Large firm nodular mass palpated in LUQ
extending to umbilicus.  Liver edge palpable 2 cm below the
costal margin, though edge sharp and surface smooth.
Extr: Trace edema of LLE to knee.

[**2107-9-26**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS, IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions
with adjacent compressive atelectasis. The overall appearance
and bilateral effusions is most suggestive of failure.
2. Interval development and increase in size of numerous
pulmonary nodules. The differential includes metastatic disease,
although the rapidity of the change compared to the prior study
makes this unusual, and infectious etiologies, particularly
given the surrounding ground glass.
3. Slight interval increase in the previously described large
left adrenal mass, as discussed previously. The overall
stability of the configuration and lack of a large change in
mass makes this unlikely to account for a large hematocrit drop.

[**9-26**] CXR PA and lat:  IMPRESSION: CHF. Increased opacity in the
left lower lobe could be atelectasis or pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo M with history of prostatic adenocarcinoma s/p radiation
in [**2097**], adrenal mass (presumed angiomyolipoma) recently
demonstrating signs of malignant conversion, MGUS, mitral
regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation s/p CVA x 2 on coumadin,
who presented to the ED on the day of admission with fatigue and
DOE, found to have new large pleural effusions, increased
pulmonary nodules, mild leukocytosis, large hematocrit drop, and
guaiac positive stools.

1. Lung/liver nodules: preliminary cytology from pleural fluid
with some atypical cells. Final report revealing mesothelial
cells, blood and no evidence of malignant cells. However, it is
still possible that malignant cells were present considering
that there was no other evidence of infection in tap. However,
did have elevated WBC but also had urosepsis.

2. Dyspnea: Dyspnea worsened with re accumulation of pleural
effusions but also with increased size of nodules.  Preliminary
cytology from thoracentesis results with atypical cells.  CTA no
PE.  Bedside echo no tamponade. Had worsening respiratory
distress on [**2107-10-3**]/ Oxygen saturations began dropping on
non-rebreather. Patient was asked if he wished to be intubated
and said that he did not want this or any other drastic measures
taken.  His family was called and agreed with the patient's
wishes. He was made comfortable with morphine and expired on
[**2107-10-3**].  His family was offered an autopsy but declined.
