Brief Hospital Course:
77yo with hx HTN, AF with RVR who p/w nausea and dizziness.
States that she was walking around in her house and as she went
to pull up the shade she fellt sudden onset dizziness, "room
spinning around me".  Went to the couch and sat down, no LOC, no
trauma.  Approximately 2h later felt nauseous and had dry
heaves.  Also states she had a "knot" in her chest that felt
better with burping.  Pressure non-radiating, no shortness of
breath, no fevers, chills. +productive cough but chronic,
+weakness and malaise, +nausea, no vomiting.

Patient was evaluated by cardiac surgery on [**2169-4-4**].  After
appropriate pre-operative work-up, she was taken to the OR on
[**2169-4-7**] for hemiarch replacement (28mm gelweave), aorta to
innominate conduit, AV resuspension.  Post-operatively, she was
transferred to the CSRU where she had peri-operative atrial fib
with hypotension.  She was electrically cardioverted POD 3,
however did not stay in a sinus rhythym.  Her hemodynamics did
improve, though, and she was eventually extubated on POD 5,
chest tubes and wires were removed per protocol.  She had some
serous drainage from her sternum which resolved without
intervention.  Patient was also anti-coagulated with heparin and
coumadin for atrial fib.  She was transferred to the floor on
POD 8, where she did well.  She was evaluated by PT and they
recommended short term rehab.  On POD#12 she was noted to have
an elevated WBC.  Her central line was d/c and her WBC began to
decrease.  She was started on bactrim for a positive UA. She
thrn developed a rash and had a negative urine culture, so the
bactrim was discontinued.  She continued to improve and was
discharged to rehab on POD#17 in stable condition.
