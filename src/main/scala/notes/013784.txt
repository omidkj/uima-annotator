Admission Date:  [**2112-3-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2112-3-27**]


Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 81-year-old woman was a
direct admission from an outside hospital for transfer for an
inferior myocardial infarction complicated by a ventricular
septal defect (also known as ventricular septal defect).

She has a history of hypertension and mild dementia.  She
developed chest pain at [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital and went to the
hospital there after having pain while she was at church.
She went to see her primary care physician and had an
electrocardiogram there which showed inferior ST elevations
and Q waves with a completed inferior myocardial infarction.
She went to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital.  She
became hypotensive.  Her enzymes were elevated.  Her
electrocardiogram changes were abnormal.  She was started on
aspirin and heparin.  She had a transthoracic echocardiogram
to evaluate a holosystolic murmur which showed the presence
of a large ventricular septal defect and mitral
regurgitation.

She was transferred urgently to [**Hospital1 188**] for surgical repair of her ventricular septal defect.
She came directly to the catheterization laboratory which
showed a 90% right coronary artery lesion, a 50% left
anterior descending artery lesion, a 50% first diagonal
lesion.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, and left
ventricular gram showed a large ventricular septal defect and
moderate mitral regurgitation, and she was transferred up to
the Coronary Care Unit for medical management prior to
ventricular septal defect repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission were as
follows)
1.  Aldomet 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aspirin.
4.  Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Aricept 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Detrol 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8.  Heparin (from the catheterization laboratory).

ALLERGIES:  She had no known drug allergies.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories from
the outside hospital showed a white blood cell count of 12,
hematocrit of 35.5, platelet count of 202,000.  INR was 0.94,
PT was 12, PTT was 25.3.  Sodium of 138, potassium of 4.2,
chloride of 98, bicarbonate of 25, blood urea nitrogen of 47,
creatinine of 2.5, with a blood glucose of 119.  Calcium
of 9.2, albumin of 3.8, ALT of 106, AST of 155, elevated
cardiac enzymes, with LDH of 526, and total bilirubin of 0.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Her acute renal failure was noted.  Her
balloon pump remained in place, and she was referred to
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for evaluation and repair of her
ventricular septal defect.

On examination by the cardiothoracic surgery fellow, the
patient was mildly confused without any focal deficits.  Mean
arterial pressure was 62, pulmonary artery pressure was
46/14.  She had no bruits in her neck.  Her lungs were clear.
She had a grade [**4-13**] holosystolic murmur.  Her abdominal
examination was benign.  She had 1+ distal pulses and an
right lower extremity intra-aortic balloon pump was in place.
Her creatinine had dropped from 2.5 to 1.6.  The
determination was that she was in cardiogenic shock secondary
to her ischemic ventricular septal defect and severe mitral
regurgitation.

[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]sion was also held with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Cardiology
about the possibility of using a high-risk ventricular septal
defect closure device.  The patient was accepted as a
surgical candidate; although high risk by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

The patient did have a right coronary artery stent in the
catheterization laboratory without any other significant
events, with the plan to possibly treat the left anterior
descending artery lesion after ventricular septal defect
repair or concurrently.  The patient remained on aspirin
therapy also.

The patient continued to be monitored in the Coronary Care
Unit over the next day to allow her to have some recovery
time from her myocardial infarction.

On [**3-25**], she went to the operating room with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and had a coronary artery bypass graft times one
with a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending
artery and a patch repair for post infarct ventricular septal
defect.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition postoperatively.  On
postoperative day one, the patient was on propofol at 30,
Neo-Synephrine at 0.5, insulin at 1.5, intra-aortic balloon
pump at 1:1, and one other drug (unclear what that was).

She was atrial paced at 70 with a blood pressure of 103/52,
mixed venous at 70%, pulmonary artery was 28/16.
Postoperative white blood cell count was 12, hematocrit
of 29.4, platelet count of 50,000.  INR was 1.3, PTT
was 52.4, PT was 13.5.  Sodium of 139, potassium of 5,
chloride of 110, bicarbonate of 18, blood urea nitrogen
of 39, creatinine of 1.4, with a blood glucose of 154.
Lactic acid was 2.8 (up from 1.9).  Her sternum was stable.
Her lungs were clear bilaterally.  Her heart was regular in
rate and rhythm.  She had dopplerable pulses in her
extremities.  Neurologically, she remained sedated.  The need
for increased products with a five pack of platelets and one
unit of fresh frozen plasma to be able to pull the balloon
was noted and ordered.  Chest tubes remained in place.  The
patient was calm and alert and oriented, but she did require
some gentle reminders as to where she was occasionally and
also the plan of care.

On postoperative day two, the balloon was discontinued.  The
patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
Urine output was low.  Neo-Synephrine was at 0.8.  Milrinone
at 0.3.  The patient was in sinus rhythm with a blood
pressure of 113/58.  She remained intubated with a mixed
venous of 72%, white blood cell count of 10.2, hematocrit of
24.2.  Her platelet count rose to 111,000.  Blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine continued to climb with a blood urea
nitrogen of 48 (up from 39) and a creatinine of 2.4 (up from
1.4).  Blood sugar was 120.  The patient remained intubated.
The examination was otherwise benign.  Plans were made to
wean the ventilator and to keep chest tubes in place.  Lactic
acid on that day was 2, and plans were made to wean the
Neo-Synephrine and hopefully discontinue the Milrinone.

At 11:30 p.m. in the evening, the Cardiothoracic resident was
called as the patient was having difficulty breathing.  The
patient had been suctioned and then had a flat wave on his
electrocardiogram.  A code was called.  The patient was
unresponsive.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started.
Epinephrine was given.  Chest tubes had greater than 500 cc
of bright red blood.  The fellow and the attending were
notified.  Pulmonary artery pressure shot up to 75, with the
blood pressure dropping below 80, signally possibly
tamponade.  The chest was opened.  A large amount of blood
was suctioned.  There was a large left ventricular
perforation adjacent to the patch for the ventricular septal
defect repair.  Digital pressure was applied.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was resuscitated with level I with packed red
blood cells and intravenous fluids.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14968**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37826**]
were present.  They were unable to keep up the volume status
and despite multiple ampules of epinephrine, bicarbonate, and
internal massage.  There was no intrinsic heart rhythm.  The
time of death of the patient was 10:45 p.m. in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on [**3-27**].
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was called and made aware of all events.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times one with
patch repair of the ventricular septal defect.
2.  Inferior myocardial infarction.
3.  Cardiogenic shock.
4.  Status post stent of the right coronary artery.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Mild dementia.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Again, the patient expired in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on [**2112-3-27**].
