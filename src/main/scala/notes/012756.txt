The patient is an 84 year-old man with a PMH significant for
ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25%, CAD, DVT/A Fib on coumadin,
bladder cancer s/p transurethral resection requiring straight
cath who presents to the ED following episode of lightheadness.
Today wife was straight cathing the patient (typically done
every 1-2 days) and a large amount of blood returned. During
this time patient became lightheaded/presyncopal and
consequently presented to the ED. Denies recent fever, chills,
cough. Denies recent hematuria (other than todays episode) or
blood in the stool. Denies recent chest pain. Denies increase in
lower extremity edema. Has baseline orthopnea and PND - but no
recent increase. Patient had one transient episode of shortness
of breath last week but resolved without intervention. Overall
patient has been feeling his usual state of health.
.
In the ED, VS 97.8 HR 72 BP 74/47 RR 20 O2 97%. Labs notable for
HCT 31.9, WBC 11.6 (89% N, 2% bands), creatinine 2.6, lactate
4.7 (improved to 3 with 3 L NS) and positive Ua with large
blood. Patient was broadly covered with Vancomycin/Zosyn. Upon
placement of foley a blood clot returned but urine turned clear
with continuous irrigation. Patient's blood pressure improved to
100-110 with 3 L NS but prior to ICU transfer became hypotensive
(SBP 80s) requiring central line placement and started on
Levophed.

Imaging:
CT Abd:
Pt is a 22 y.o male with h.o Crohns disease (followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3708**] on Cimzia as has failed prior tx (pentasa, budesonide,
infliximab), recently admitted with symptoms of Crohns flare and
SBO, who now presents with abdominal pain and vomiting.


IMPRESSION:
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were acquired through the pelvis
following
injection of contrast via the Foley catheter. Approximately 300
cc of diluted Cysto-Conray was administered via gravity to the
Foley. Coronal and sagittal reformats were produced and
reviewed.

FINDINGS: The bladder is moderately well distended with
contrast. There is a small amount of free air in the bladder and
a Foley catheter in situ. There is prominent trabeculation at
the right lateral wall of the bladder with bladder diverticula
seen postero-laterally on the right. There is mild residual
thickening of the bladder wall seen at the left side
posteriorly, near but not at the left ureteral orifice. There is
reflux of contrast into the left distal ureter. No bladder leak
is seen. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis
most seen in the right iliac fossa. No cause for this is
identified on the current study. There is extensive vascular
calcification noted. No pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.
BONY STRUCTURES: There is moderate-to-severe degenerative
