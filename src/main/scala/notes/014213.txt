Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
left flank pain, chest pain, shortness of breath (CCU admission
for RA thrombus)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right atrial mass resection [**2194-10-1**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 21y/o gentleman with AIHA s/p splenectomy on
steroids and Danazol, IgA deficency (likely transforming into
CVID) with h/o portal vein thrombosis, left renal vein infarct,
and pulmonary embolus now on Enoxaparin, as well as
steroid-induced DM2 who presented to the ED with left flank
pain, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

His recent baseline is that he is quite sedentary but can
normally climb a few flights of stairs with no problems if
needed.  His HR since [**2194-6-8**] has been 100-110.  But for the
past 2 days he has had chest pain: mild discomfort at his left
side and his left frontal chest that becomes moderate and sharp
with deep breathing.  There are no associated symptoms.  The
pain does not radiate.  In addition, he notes worsened left
flank pain "like the pain I had with the kidney blood clot."
Has noted worsening dyspnea on exertion to the point that he
can't walk even a few steps before feeling short of breath. He
went to his PCP's office who was concerned by his symptoms so
EMS was called and he was taken to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.  EMS found
his VS to be: BP 152/92, HR 116, RR 18, POx 95%RA.

At [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, his VS were: rectal T 100.1, BP 122/95, HR
104, RR 18, POx 96% 2L NC.  His labs were notable for WBC 26
(96% PMN, 1% bands).  Blood cultures were sent and he received
Levofloxacin 500mg IV in case of pneumonia (though CXR was
clear).  Received 1L NS.  Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to
medical complexity.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his initial VS were: pain [**3-18**], T 95, HR 106,
BP 148/103, RR 22, POx 91%RA-->96% 2L NC.  Labs were notable for
WBC 27.9 (N:94 Band:1 L:1), Hct 40.6, plt 373. BUN 14, Cr 1.0, K
5.2. Lactate 0.8.  Serum tox screen was negative.  EKG revealed
NSR, rate 93, old TWI in III.  Due to suspicion for PE, CTA was
performed that revealed bilateral subsegmental PEs in the lung
bases, but also a large filling defect in the RA that was
suggestive of a near occlusive RA thrombus.  In addition, he had
left renal vein thrombus.  Cardiac Surgery was consulted and
recommended anticoagulation and consideration for possible
thrombectomy.  Cardiology Fellow performed a limited TTE which
showed a limited view of the RA, but no evidence of RV strain.
He was started on a Heparin gtt, as well as receiving Dilaudid
1mg IV x3 for chest discomfort.  Received 1L NS in the ED here.
He was never hemodynamically unstable but given his large clot
burden he was admitted to the CCU for monitoring. Cardiac
surgery was consulted for mass/ clot excision.

Pertinent Results:
CTA CHEST AND CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [Preliminary Report] [**2194-9-30**]
1. Bilateral subsegmental pulmonary embolism. No evidence of
pulmonary infarct or right heart strain.
2. Large right atrial filling defect concerning for near
occlusive thrombus. Recommend further evaluation with echo.
3. Otherwise, stable exam with atrophic left kidney and stable
severe
hydronephrosis and hydroureter extending to the level of the mid
ureter likely due to thrombus. Previously noted main portal vein
thrombus appears completely resolved.

TEE [**2194-10-1**]
PRE-BYPASS:
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage or left atrium.
There is a large approximately 3 x 5 cm mass in the right atrium
that originates on the free wall and partially obstructs right
ventricular diastolic inflow. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricle displays low
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results prior to incision.
POST-BYPASS:
Overall biventricular systolic function is unchanged. The right
atrial mass has been excised. Mitral and aortic valve function
are unchanged. There is some increase in the degree of tricuspid
regurgitation and is now bordering on moderate. There is no
evidence of aortic dissection in images obtained.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 21 year old gentleman with AIHA s/p splenectomy,
IgA deficency (likely transforming into CVID) with h/o portal
vein thrombosis, left renal vein infarct, and pulmonary embolus
(on Enoxaparin, steroids and Danazol), as well as
steroid-induced DM2 who presented to the ED with left flank
pain, chest pain, and shortness of breath in the setting of
known left renal vein thrombus, new PE, and incidental finding
of large intracardiac thrombus for which he was admitted to the
CCU.  On TEE he was found to have very large mobile RA clot so
he went to Cardiac Surgery.

The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2194-10-1**] where
the patient underwent excision of large right atrial thrombus.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert
