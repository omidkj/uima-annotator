History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 yo woman with h/o Steroid induced
hyperglycemia, COPD, MFAT, Asthma (recently on prednisone
taper), PVD, who presented to the GI suite as an outpt today for
colonoscopy to work up GI bleed. Prior to the procedure the
patient appeared confused and was difficult to [**Last Name (LF) 96592**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her
FS was checked and was 19. Further questioning revealed that
although she had been NPO for her scope, she did receive her
full dose of lantus insulin last night at [**Hospital1 **]. Unclear if
she also received humalog this morning as well. In the GI suite
she was given 2 amps of D50 and was transferred to the ER. By
report her HR was 35 in the GI suite, however EKG performed
almost immediately thereafter revealed HR 70s; and in the ED she
was found to have HR of 80 with sinus rhythm and no ischemic
changes. On arrival to the ER her FS was 160. She had frequent
FS checks q1-2 hours and was found to have sporadic FS ranging
as high as 160 and as low as 52. In the ER she received a total
of 1.5 amps of D50 and was started on D5 1/2NS drip. On arrival
she was also found to be hypothermic with rectal temp of 32.5
degrees celsius. With a warming blanket this improved to 36.1
degrees. She was normotensive on arrival, however she had an
episode of hypotension in the ER to 80s/40s nad was started on
fluids immediately following which she was transferred to the
MICU. On arrival in the MICU and after one litre of NS and 500
cc bolus of D5 [**11-28**] she was still hypotense with sbp in the 80's.
Etiology unclear. She is admitted to the MICU for further
monitoring.
.
On arrival in the MICU, she was found to have a BP of 113/77,
and BG of 167, and appeared in NAD.
.
Called [**Hospital3 7**] and confirmed the following: pt. was
not given prednisone since [**10-9**] despite the fact that she was
due for this on taper schedule, furthermore: pt. was given
lantus eve of [**10-9**] then TF held at MN and prepped. At 1 am on
am [**10-11**], she had a BG of 45 and required a D 10 Gtt. This was
d/c'd prior to   transfer to [**Hospital1 **].

CXR: IMPRESSION:
1) Slight improvement in right lower lobe atelectasis with
residual rounded opacity centrally. This is most likely due to a
rounded area of atelectasis given lack of mass on CT scan but
continued follow up recommended.

2) Persistent left lower lobe opacity, likely due to atelectasis
although underlying infection is not excluded.

3) Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly
improved on the right.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 y/o woman with steroid dependent asthma
currently on prednisone taper who presented to outpatient
gastroenterology today for a colonoscopy to work up a past GI
bleed.  Notably, she had not been given her prednisone doses for
the past two days despite her order for a slow taper.  She
received her Lantus 22 units on the night prior to admission,
but was then NPO/tube feeds held for her colonoscopy.  She had a
FS of 45 and was started on D10 at [**Hospital1 **], but this was
discontinued and the pt was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] where she was found to
have a FS of 19.
.
Hypoglycemia: She was transferred to the ER where she was
treated with D50 for a total of 3.5 amps.  She was also put on a
D5 drip.  Her fingersticks fluctuated in the ER between 52 and
160, however since arrival on the floor she had no fingersticks
below the 80s and on the day of discharge had fingersticks in
the 200s after we had held her lantus the night prior.  We
restarted her tube feeds on arrival to the floor.  She should be
covered with her insulin slide scale throughout the day on the
day of discharge, anticipating that she will likely run higher
than usual, and should be given her pm lanstus dose of 22 units
tonight.  Please do not give the patient her full dose of lantus
if her tube feeds will be held in the future (consider halving
dose). Also please recall that the patient is not diabetic, but
her hyperglycemia is due to steroids, so as her steroids taper
(or if they are inappropriately held) she may require less
insulin.
.
Hypotension: The patient's hypotension in the ER was transient
and responded to fluids.  This is likely in setting of her
completing a bowel prep and not taking tube feeds on the day
prior to admission, and may also reflect adrenal insufficiency
in the setting of a sudden d/c of her prednisone, which was
intended to be slowly tapered.  The patient responded to fluid
boluses in the ICU and has had stable BP since arrival on the
floor. We restarted her prednisone at her home dose of 10mg po
qday and she should continue this dose until [**10-14**], at which
time she may decrease to 5mg po qday as directed.
   -we held her usual diltiazem for HTN while she was in-house,
please monitor her BP throughout the day today and this can be
restarted today or toorrow as needed.
.
GIB: The patient has a hematocrit near her baseline at this
time.  Colonoscopy to be scheduled again as an outpatient with
the patient's gastoenterologist to evaluate.  Please be sure to
cut her lantus dose by about half when she has tube feeds held
for this procedure and confirm this with her gastroenterologist
prior to the procedure.
