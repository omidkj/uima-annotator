Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ranitidine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
87 year-old female with history of hiatal hernia/GERD, AF,
history of recent aspiration pneumonia presents with progressive
SOB.

She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia and treated
wtih Levofloxacin for 14 days. She completed her antibiotics and
presented to her PCPs office where a CXR was performed. The CXR
was unchanged so she had a CT which showed multifocal
infiltrates, ? aspiration versus infectious. She was told to eat
smaller meals and avoid eating quickly. For the last week, she
has had increased shortness of breath. Five days prior to
admission she was having lots of coughing and shortness of
breath. 911 was called but didn't bring her to the ED. On
Sunday, she was at the [**Last Name (un) 4068**] because she swallowed a hearing
aid. A CXR was performed but no further intervention was
performed.

Over the past week, she notes increasing fatigue and shortness
of breath. she endorses a mild non-productive cough, worse at
night. No fever/chills. No orthopnea, PND, or edema.

In the ED, a CXR showed new multifocal infiltrates. A chest CT
was subsequently obtained, which showed worsening
consolidations, especially in RML with RML collapse, with ? RML
abscess. She was given Ceftriaxone, Atithromycin and Flagyl.

Past Medical History:
1. Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin

Relevant imaging data:

[**2114-5-30**] CXR: AP chest compared to [**5-1**] and [**5-17**]. Right
upper lobe pneumonia is appreciably larger. Small region of
pneumonia at the right base is stable. Heart size top normal.
Small right pleural effusion, stable. No pneumothorax.

[**2114-5-30**] CT CHEST: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2.
Interval increase in the size of right middle lobe consolidation
with further progression and increase in size of an area of low
attenuation measuring 2.3 x 2.6 cm representing an abscess.
There is stable appearance of the right lower lobe consolidation
and slight interval decrease in the size of small nodular
consolidation in the left apex. 3. Large hiatal hernia.

[**2114-5-31**] Barium swallow: Large axial hiatal hernia with the
gastric fundus above the diaphragm. Persistent retention of
barium in the herniated fundus at the conclusion of the exam. No
evidence of reflux, but poor compliance.

[**2114-6-2**] ECHO: [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6878**]. LV wall thicknesses and cavity size
normal. Overall LVEF normal (LVEF>55%). RV chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. AV leaflets are mildly thickened. The
aortic valve is not well seen. No AS, mild (1+) AR. MV valve
leaflets are mildly to moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. LV inflow pattern suggests impaired
relazation. TV valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no
pericardial effusion.

[**2114-6-5**] CT CHEST: 1. Minimal improvement in extensive
necrotizing pneumonia in the right upper lobe. Slight
improvement in the left upper lobe nodular opacity. No change in
the right lower lobe consolidation. 2. Increasing right pleural
effusion and new left pleural effusion. 3. Stable appearance of
enlarged thyroid and large hiatal hernia.

[**2114-6-11**] CXR: 1. Resolving multifocal pneumonia and small
bilateral pleural effusions. 2. Hiatal hernia.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old female with a large hiatal and probable aspiration
events, admitted with worsening shortness of breath, with
imaging studies showing progression of her multifocal
infiltrates.

1. Multifocal pneumonia and ? RML abscess: Pulmonary was
consulted on admission, and she was placed on Ceftriaxone and
Flagyl for coverage of probable multifocal aspiration pneumonia.
Blood cultures drawn prior to initiation of antibiotics remained
negative. Given concern over aspiration events, she was
evaluated by speech and swallow, and a barium swallow was
obtained on [**2114-5-31**] which revealed retention of contrast in the
hernia without overt reflux. The study, however, was limited by
poor patient compliance. On [**2114-5-31**], she was noted to be more
somnolent, with increasing oxygen requirement and a temperature
to 101.7. Vancomycin was added for broader coverage. A CXR
obtained at that time showed some pulmonary edema, and she was
treated with Lasix diuresis. She, however, remained somnolent,
and an ABG obtained the following morning showed 7.34/62/65. She
was transferred to the MICU for further monitoring and
management. She spontaneously improved, and did not require
BiPAP. Her decompensation was ultimately attributed to
anxiolytic administration. She was transferred back to the floor
after 1 day in the ICU. While in the ICU, an echo was obtained,
which showed preserved systolic function, evidence of diastolic
dysfunction, and non-significant valvular disease. Note was made
of thickened MV valve leaflets, non-specific, no obvious
vegetation.

On the floor, she was changed to Clindamycin. A repeat CT on
[**2114-6-5**] showed "minimal improvement in extensive necrotizing
pneumonia in the RUL, slight improvement in the LUL opacity, no
change in the RLL consolidation. Note was also made of
increasing right pleural effusion and new left pleural
effusion.". Given these findings, a thoracentesis was
entertained, and Coumadin was held in anticipation for this. A
repeat CXR on [**6-11**], however, showed decreased effusions, and a
bedside ultrasound performed by IP on [**2114-6-12**] showed
insufficient fluid to tap. She continued to improve, eventually
without oxygen requirement. She will complete a prolonged course
of Clindamycin (5 additional weeks), and will follow-up in the
Pulmonary clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. They will contact her with
the appointment date and time. She is also scheduled for a
repeat CT chest on [**7-5**] at 1130. Lenght of antibiotic
therapy will ultimately be dictated by clinical/radiographic
resolution.

Emphasis was placed on aspiration precautions, and eating small
meals.

2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: As noted above, her Coumadin
was held in anticipation for a possible thoracentesis. She was
given 2 doses of Vitamin K to expedite reversal of Warfarin
therapy. She was started on Heparin IV when INR<2. Coumadin was
eventually resumed at 5 mg daily (her out-patient dose) on
[**2114-6-12**], and she was placed on Lovenox (1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **]) to brige
until therapeut
