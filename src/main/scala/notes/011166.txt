MRI

History of Present Illness:
50 year old RH woman with h/o protein C defficiency and
venous sinus thrombosis.  Was recently discharged [**2114-8-7**] on
lovenox and reportedly was doing fine initially.  [**Name (NI) **]
sister and mother at bedside report that she first started
comlaining of headache 2-3 days ago.  Also complained that she
couldn't see characters on the right side of the TV.  She
presented today in neurology clinic for follow up where she
complained of headache and was noted to have a right field cut
on
exam.  Patient is inattentive, aphasic and perseverating so
unable to give a coherent history other than talking about her
headache.  Describes the headache as "hurts on the top of my
head" and reports that its worse when she's lying down in bed.
Complains of nausea but started vomitting only after coming to
ED.

According to sister and mother, the patient was looking better
this AM and was only complaining of "feeling terrible" and her
headache.  Was more attentive and able to express herself.
Was discharged on lovenox rather than coumadin reportedly
because
the thrombus was not responding to coumadin.

For further details of initial presentation on [**2114-8-1**] please
see
admission note from that date.

Patient unable to give coherent ROS.

Mental Status: The patient is somnolent but awakens to voice and

commands but not all.  Unable to follow complex commands and
inattentive throughout exam. Oriented to person, but names
"[**Hospital1 **]" as hospital and cannot say date.  Appears unable to
convey her thoughts/questions and perseverates frequently.  No
dysarthria.  Memory unable to be tested as inattentive.

Cranial Nerves:  The visual fields show right homonymous
hemianopsia, although testing accurately was difficult given her
inattentiveness. Patient not able to cooperate with fundoscopic
exam, but portions of disc visualized did not appear crisp. Eye
movements are normal, with no nystagmus.  Pupils
react equally to light, both directly and consensually, 4->2.
Sensation on the face is intact to light touch bilat. No drpp[
and muscles of facial expression intact bilaterally.   Hearing
is intact to voice. The palate elevates in the midline. The
tongue protrudes in the midline and is of normal appearance. Gag
is intact.

Motor System: Strength was full and equal in deltoids, triceps,
biceps.  Full and equal in IPs, quads, dorsiflexors and plantar
flexors. 5- weakness bilaterally in hamstrings.  Tone was
increased in right lower extremity just slightly.  Normal
otherwise.

Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are 1+ at biceps, triceps and BR
bilaterally.  3+ at left patella and 2 on left.  Ankles 1
bilaterally. The plantar reflexes are flexor.

Sensory: Sensation is intact to LT, "equal" in extremities, no
ext to DSS; could not test other modalities due to
inattentiveness and problems with comprehension.

Coordination: There is no ataxia on FNF and could not assess HS.

Gait:  deferred for now.

Head CT([**2114-8-22**]): Large hemorrhage within previous edematous
region in the left temporal/occipital portion of the brain, as
well as intraventricular hemorrhage. In the setting of a known
hypercoagulable state, an infarct, probably of venous origin,
with hemorrhagic transformation is suspected, with
neoplastic disease a secondary diagnostic  consideration.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Neurologically:  Was not reversed with any agents and did not
receive any blood products.  HOB was elevated and initially was
hyperventilated.  Received several doses Mannitol over first 24
hours and then was weaned off on day 3.  Systolic pressures
controlled with RTC metoprolol and prn Labetolol/metoprolol with
goal SBP around 140-150 and MAP to be less than 130.
     Over the first several hours of admission mental status
waxed and wained.  In the late hours of [**2114-8-22**] was reportedly
more somnolent.  Had the ventricular drain placed at around 0100
on [**8-23**] based on her worsening clincal exam.  Was placed
contralaterally (on right) without complication.   Went into
respiratory distress shortly after vent drain placement and was
emergently intubated.  Follow up CTs over the next 24 hours
showed increaseing hemorrhage and mass effect.  Scans eventually
stablilized and she remained intubated, eventually without
propofol, and an exam showing spontaneous left sided movements
but unresponsiveness.  Around days [**2-11**], pupils were unequal with
left 1.5mm larger than right and sluggish.  Also had bilaterally
upgoing toes temporarily.  Around [**8-28**], left toe was noted to be
down going on plantar response and pupils were noted to be equal
and brisk bilaterally.
     She was given cefazolin IV daily for CNS vent drain
infection prophylaxis.  Also received 3 days of 1mg TPA to vent
drain to prevent clotting off of drain.  Additional ipsilateral
drain was consdiered and discussed with neurosurgery but thought
not to be indicated. ICPs were initially around 30s for first 12
hours but came down to 4-10 after vent drain adjusment in the
first 12 hours.  Vent drain output was initially low but
increased to 1800cc/day on day 6 of the vent drain.  Plan on
[**8-28**] was to increase ICP to around 20 and use TPA to try and
lyse the intraventricular clot on the left side.
     Received seizure prophylaxis with Topamax which was
increased from 100 [**Hospital1 **] to 200 [**Hospital1 **].  Gabapentin was also
increased to 900 TID.  All anticoagulation was held initially.
Eventually received prophylactic doses of heparin (5000 u SC
TID) starting [**8-25**]).
     Became more arousable and with more left sided spontaneous
movemnts on [**8-28**] with CT scan essentially unchanged.  From [**8-28**]
to [**8-31**] CTs essentially unchanged excep
