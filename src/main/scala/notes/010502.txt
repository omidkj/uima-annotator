History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60yo F w/ a PMH of hypothyroidism, hypertension,
fibromyalgia and hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH today
for evaluation of a month of night sweats, worsening back pain,
frequent and easy bruising, and fatigue. She had been to her PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] 1 week ago for evaluation of these symptoms and had her
thyroid checked (which was normal per her report). She continued
to feel poorly so presented to [**Hospital6 8972**] today
for evaluation and her CBC revealed a WBC of 185K, with 90%
peripheral blasts. Her platelets were also found to be ~35K and
her fibrinogen was undetectable. She was reportedly given
cryoprecipitate and antibiotics (but there is no documentation
of this) and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
On arrival here, her VS were T 100.0, BP 148/80, HR 100, RR 20,
sats of 98% on RA. Initial labs showed a WBC of 185k with a
predominance of blasts and some promyelocytes. Her transaminases
were elevated, her uric acid was 7.8, LDH 897, INR 1.4, K 3.2,
Cr 1.0 and fibrinogen 197. She remained afebrile in ER (T
99.3-100.0), BP 111-137/61-83, HR 70s. She was seen by the
heme-onc team who looked at her peripheral smear and felt that
it was most consistent with the microgranular variant of APML.
She was given 3gm hydrea PO x1, D5W + 3amps bicarb at 150/hr,
and 300mg allopurinol x1. A CVL was placed and she received 1u
plts post CVL placement. She was then transferred to 7F for
further management.
.
On arrival to 7F, she states that she overall is feeling OK. She
has a [**3-25**] headache, bandlike, across her forehead and behind
her eyes, c/w her sinus headaches. She's had this same headache
for about 2 weeks. Not associated with any vision changes,
weakness, numbness or tingling. She usually takes tylenol for
this but her last dose of tylenol was this AM. She otherwise
feels fatigued and a little nauseated, but otherwise is doing
well.
.
ROS:
+ NS, as well as "sweats" during the day
no frank fever, chills
no weight changes but + anorexia x1 week
+ easy bruising (several wks) and bleeding from her gums (1 day)
denies any visual changes
+ headaches as noted above, along with increased fatigue
denies ST, nasal congestion, ear pain, + rhinorrhea

denies epistaxis
denies rashes, + dry skin
+ worsening back pain over last 24 hrs

Pertinent Results:
CXR PA/LAT [**2173-1-30**]   No evidence of pneumonia/edema.
.
CVR PA/LAT [**2173-1-31**] Cardiac size is top normal.  Right internal
jugular catheter tip is in the SVC with no pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.  Ill-defined bibasilar reticular opacities are
new and of uncertain etiology, for which, if clinically
indicated, further evaluation with CT for further
characterization could be performed.
.
CXR Port [**2173-2-1**] Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged with
cardiac size top normal.  Right IJ line tip is in the SVC.
Small left pleural effusion has increased.  Bibasilar
atelectases has increased, worse in the right side.  There is
engorgement of the pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature without
overt CHF.  No radiologic
findings of ARDS.
.
[**2-1**] Liver US-  No evidence of hepatic mass or gallbladder
pathology and otherwise unremarkable ultrasound.
.
[**2-2**] TTE-  Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2).
The right ventricular cavity is borderline dilated with normal
free wall contractility. No structural valvular disease. Resting
tachycardia.
.
[**2-2**] CXR Portable- New moderate pulmonary edema.  Small
bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
.
[**2-3**] CXR Portable- Worsening moderate pulmonary edema with small
bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased left basilar
atelectasis.
.
[**2-3**] Lower extremity arterial non-invasives at rest- Normal
resting arterial study
.
[**2-3**] CXR portable- Worsening moderately severe pulmonary edema
with increasing confluent areas of opacification in the right
upper and left mid lung zones representing asymmetric edema or
evolving infectious process.


Brief Hospital Course:
Initial BMT floor course:
After admission to the BMT floor, pt was started on treatment
with cytarabine. She was also given hydroxyurea, allopurinol,
and hydration. Patient was noted to have hypoxia to 86% on RA on
[**1-31**], and was placed on 3L NC, and decision was made to start
leukopheresis in preparation for starting ATRA. She received one
round of leukopheresis on [**1-31**] and one on [**2-1**]. Over the course
of the next two days, patient received 2u pRBC, 5u
cryoprecipitate, 2u FFP, and 2u platelets for DIC. She was 6L
positive and on [**2-1**], she again had a desaturation to 87% on 2L
NC and was febrile to 101.1. She was diuresed with lasix with
some response, and was also started on aztreonam. She remained
persistently febrile to 103.8 and vancomycin was started as
well. On [**2-2**] she desat'd again in the setting of SBP 170 and
was put on a NRB. Blood gas showed hypoxemia. She was started on
10mg IV decadron. She was transferred to MICU for hypoxic
respiratory failure. Potential etiologies of her respiratory
failure considered were pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid
overload, pulmonary hemorrhage, TRALI, leukostasis, or
pneumonia.
ICU course:
Initially placed on BIPAP 2 hours on, 1 hour off for 2 days and
then was weaned off to 3LO2 NC. She was diuresed aggressively
due to concern for volume overload, but this was hindered by her
continued need for blood products. It was felt her respiratory
failure was due to a combination of volume overload and
capillary leak. She was started on ATRA and given 3 doses
initially, then held due ot concern over ATRA syndrome.  Her DIC
was resolving with stable fibrinogen. She was continued on
vanc/aztreonam and levoflox was added for atypical coverage. She
also developed acute renal failure and therefore her cytarabine
and hydrea were held. Nephrology was consulted and felt this to
be a tubular toxic effect from cytarabin/hydrea (she had
granular casts on sedime
