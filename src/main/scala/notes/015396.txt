Discharge Disposition:

Discharge Diagnosis:
b/l fem stenosis / pvd

Discharge Condition:
Stable

Discharge Instructions:
This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a
speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these
guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you
otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any
questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.

ACTIVITY:

There are no specific restrictions on activity. You should be as
active as is comfortable. Resume driving when you are
comfortable without the need for pain medication.

CAUTIONS:

NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is
an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you
smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse
or doctor for information on smoking cessation.

Avoid heavy lifting (over 10 pounds) for 4-6 weeks after
surgery.
No strenuous activity for 4-6 weeks after surgery.

BATHING/SHOWERING:

You may bathe or shower immediately upon coming home. Dissolving
sutures, which do not have to be removed were probably used.
Your wounds are covered with a clear, plastic dressing which
should be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this
time and wash your incisions gently with soap and water.

DIET:

There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.
Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent
meals may be preferred.

For people with vascular problems we would recommend a
cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and
low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile
in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in
serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a
reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that
most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to
decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the
bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density
Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's
permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred
or get a referral from your doctor.

If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight
management program. Your health and its improvement depend on
it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be
easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new
attitude.. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get
a referral from your doctor.

If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may
request a referral from your doctor.

MEDICATIONS:

Unless told otherwise, you should continue taking all of the
medications that you were on before surgery. You will be given a
new prescription for pain medication, which should be taken
every three (3) to four (4) hours if necessary.

WOUND CARE:

Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are not, an
appointment will be made for you to return for staple removal.
Unless the doctor instructs otherwise, you may resume showering
with the staples in place on the third day after surgery (if the
incision is dry).

When the staples are removed the doctor may or may not place
pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm
water and soap in the shower.

Unless the doctor instructs otherwise, you may resume showering
on the third day after surgery (if the incision is dry)
Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for
two weeks after surgery.

FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:

Be sure to keep your medic
