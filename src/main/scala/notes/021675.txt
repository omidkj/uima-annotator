History of Present Illness:
83yo F h/o DM, CAD s/p MI, CRI who was discharged on [**2139-1-16**]
after a lengthy hospitalization for trauma.  Please see prior
discharge summary.  In brief, She fell down stairs, sustained
multiple facial fractures, a L radial fracture that was
splinted.  She subsequently developed a L PCA stroke, received a
trach and PEG, had a PEG site bleed, and developed HIT.  Her
stay was further complicated by a MRSA PNA.  She was discharged
to Rehab but after approximately 3 hours was found unresponsive.
 The blood glucose was 20, she received one amp D50 with some
improvement, received a 2nd amp and placed on a D10 drip, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
Apparently, the tube feeds were held during the transfer to
rehab, while the patient continued to receive her scheduled
insulin.

Sputum Cx [**1-22**]: positive for serratia, pan-sensitive.

Brief Hospital Course:
    83yo F admitted for hypoglycemia, corrected by time pt
arrived at [**Hospital1 18**].  Initially admitted to medicine service and
then subsequently transferred to Trauma Surgery who knew this
patient from her prior admission, six hours earlier.  In short,
pt had become hypoglycemic when her TF were held yet her insulin
continued during the transit to rehab.  She was resumed on her
tube feeds, [**Last Name (un) **] consult obtained and followed the patient
throughout her stay, as did ophthalmology for a
choroidal/vitrous hemorrhage OD.
    She was awaiting re-screening when on HD 4 she developed
respiratory distress, with O2 sats in the mid-80's despite
aggressive suctioning.  A CXR showed increased opacity in the R
lung field concerning for PNA v aspiration.  She was transferred
to the ICU for ventilatory support.  She continued to receive
aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued on Vanco.  She was
given lasix for possible CHF etiology but no diuresis occurred.
Troponin leak with no MI.  A TTE showed no major changes from
[**12-30**] (EF 50-55%, mod MR, inferior hypokinesis).  She was
moderately bradycardic, HR 40's, and a cardiology consult was
obtained.  The antihypertensives were changed to hydralazine
with no beta-blockade or clonidine, synthroid started, and no
pacemaker procedure currently required.  On HD 5 the Hct fell ~7
points to 22, which was re-checked, and she was transfused 2
units of PRBCs with an appropriate response and remained stable.
    She was successfully weaned from the vent after 3 days and
resumed PT/OT.  The vancomycin course was completed.  A PICC
line was placed on [**1-22**].  Overnight on HD 7 she developed a
mucous plug and bradycardic episode, which resolved with deep NT
suctioning.  A family meeting was held to review the patient's
disposition and to address concerns about safety for rehab
discharge.  Ophthalmology was reconsulted for a dilated R pupil
and concern for closed angle glaucoma, felt likely to transition
of fluid from posterior chamber to anterior chamber secondary to
her prior traumatic injury.  A sputum culture grew pan-sensitive
serratia for which Zosyn x10days was prescribed.  She continued
to progress nicely, and participate with PT, and is discharged
to Rehab in stable condition.
