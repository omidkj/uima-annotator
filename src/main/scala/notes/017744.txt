Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72-year-old woman with DM2, ESRD on HD, sarcoidosis, COPD,
CHF (EF greater than 55 percent), now transferred to Medicine
service after stabilization and goal directed therapy for
presumed sepsis in MICU.
.
The pt was in her USOH until 48 hours PTA, when she developed
malaise, fever, and chills.  The following day, she was noted to
have fever to 102F at hemodiaylsis.  She was treated w/ a dose
of IV Vanc during HD, and then sent home. Yesterday, she
developed worsening fevers/chills despite dose of abx, and was
referred to ED by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 3754**] are no diarrhea, cough,
dysuria, sick contacts.  She has tunneled line for access (R
Hickman) that was inserted 8 mo ago and was infected 6 mo ago
per pt report.  At that time, her line was left in place and she
was treated through the infection w/ abx.
.
In ED her temp was 102F, she was normotensive w/ normal heart
rate, but was tachypneic w/ leukocytosis and initial Lactate
4.3. Code sepsis was initiated, L IJ placed, CTA performed to
r/o PE.  She was then transferred to the MICU for goal directed
therapy.
.
In the MICU, the pt was treated w/ vancomycin and gentamicin for
presumed line infection.  She received IVFs and was observed to
be hemodynamically stable overnight, resulting in decreased
lactate.  Given the pt's stability and lack of septic
physiology, she is now transferred to the Medicine service for
ongoing care.

CTA Chest:
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, as previously noted in
CT scan of [**2144-11-3**]. Clinical correlation requested.
Comparison with previous CT scan can be performed when the study
becomes available.
3) Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
with compressive atelectatic changes of the left lung.
4) Pneumobilia, probably due to prior biliary procedures.

echo
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

......................
foot XR FINDINGS: Multiple views of both feet show no evidence
of fracture, dislocation, or bone destruction. No radiopaque
foreign bodies are seen. Diffuse demineralization is identified.
Posterior and plantar calcaneal spurs are present on the left as
well as a plantar calcaneal spur on the right. [**Year (4 digits) **]
calcifications are identified within both feet.

IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of bone destruction within
either foot.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73-yo-woman w/ ESRD admitted w/ fever, chills, tachypnea
and leukocytosis likely [**3-8**] dialysis cath infxn.

1. Fever:  On presentation Pt with fever and recent chills
likely [**3-8**] dialysis cath infxn given lack of localizing
symptoms.  At that time leukocytosis, fever, hypoxia  and
elevated lactate concerning for sepsis, so MICU team involved in
initial evaluation.  Following protocol for early directive
treatment, a internal jugular catheter was placed and PT
observed overnight in the MICU.  Prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], Pt
recieved dose of vancomycin during dialysis.  Perhaps as a
result, blood cultures obtained afterwards were without growth.
Pt covered empiricially with broad spectrum antibiotics:
Vancomycin, Flagyl and gentamicin.  Pt remained afebrile and HD
stable in the ICU and quickly transfered to regular medicine
service.  Antibiotics narrowed to Vancomycin given primary
concern for coag + staph line infection. Osetomyelitis even
though low suspicion was ruled out with plain film.  Pt remained
afebrile so decision made to treat and keep Hickman in place.
Pt discharged to complete 2 week course with Vancomycin dosed at
dialysis.
.
2. Elevated troponin: On admission pt with elevated Tt, most
likely [**3-8**] ESRD. Pt with no recent chest pain, EKG normal, CKs
flat.  Normal PMIBI in [**10-6**].  Pt was continued on ASA,
metoprolol, Plavix, statin
.
3. ESRD: [**3-8**] renal artery stenosis.  Renal followed during
admission and Pt remained on normal HD q M/W/F regimen.
.
4. Anemia:  Initial studies consistent w/ anemia of chronic dz.
As there is certainly a contribution from ESRD.  Pt w/ baseline
HCT high 20s and recieved a transfusion of 2units PRBCs on [**6-23**]
for hct <24.  Hct remained stable thereafter.
.
5. DM2: Blood glucose well controlled w/ NPH and RISS as per
outpatient regimen.
.
6. COPD: Pt well controlled  w/ atrovent and albuterol nebs as
per outpatient regimen.
.
7. Diabetic gastroparesis: Pt well controlled w/ reglan; but
renally dosed to 5mg qid.
