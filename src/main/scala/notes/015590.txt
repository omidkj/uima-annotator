Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Found collapsed, unresponsive, with right sided weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NIL

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 70385**] is a  72 yo female w/AF on coumadin, diastolic CHF,
prior CVA, who was found down, unresponsive, by her husband the
morning of [**1-19**]. She had last been seen the night prior, in her
USOH. She was brought to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital and a head CT
showed a large left MCA stroke. She was intubated and
transferred here.

Brief MICU course:
On arrival here, she was admitted to the SICU with neurology
following. Her initial head CT demonstrated the aforementioned
CVA as well as 2 mm of subfalcine herniation. She intermittently
required neo to keep her perfusion pressure high while she was
sedated on propofol. She was febrile to 101 while in the SICU
but all of her cultures remained negative. She was extubated on
[**1-21**] and called out to Neuro Step-Down on [**1-22**].

She has been making progress while on the floor. She has been
awake and alert, and was initially aphasic but then began
speaking single words. She would intermittently follow commands.
Her bp was stable in the low 90s-100s (reportedly her baseline).
She remained afebrile throughout her floor course. CXR's
demonstrated CHF and diuresis was attempted with lasix 10 IV
q6h.

On [**1-27**]. Stat head CT showed no change in the stroke or
herniation. Her vitals remained unchanged. A cardiology consult
was called to assess her CHF, and they recommended continued
diuresis. ABG was 7.49/45/65 on either 2 or 4 L O2. She became
more tachypneic, to the low 30s, and was transferred to the
MICU. Since in the MICU, she has become progressively worse and
developed CHF and pna. Her mental status has progressively
worsened. After medical treatment for several day, family
decided to change goal of care to comfort measure only due to
decline in quality of life. She is now called out to the floor
as she no longer require ICU level of respiratory care.

Past Medical History:
1. AF on coumadin
2. CHF
3. prior CVA with unknown location
4. ? cardiac amyloid
5. back surgery


Social History:
Lives at home caring for husband who is ill with heart problems
and kidney failure. Has been under a lot of "stress" lately per
daughter. Former heavy smoker, quit 10 years ago. No EtOH or
illicit drug use.

EKG: AF with ventricular rate in 60s, PVC, NSIVCD, TWI in 1/aVL,
V5-6

Relevant Imaging:
1)OSH NCHCT: large left MCA territory hypodensity with
edema involving terriorty supplied by inferior division of LMCA
with territory supplied by superior divisions less affected.
There is small amount of rightward deviation of the caudate head
toward the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.

2)Cxray ([**1-27**]): Moderately severe pulmonary edema has recurred
accompanied by slight increase in moderate-to-severe
cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Opacification in the left lower lobe is probably a combination
of atelectasis and dependent edema. Feeding tube ends in the
stomach. No pneumothorax.

3)TTE ([**1-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]  The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

4)Head CT [**1-27**]: 1. Stable CT appearance of a large MCA
territory infarct. 2. Stable 2 mm degree of subfalcine
herniation.

5)Carotid u/s [**1-21**]: There is no stenosis in the bilateral
internal carotid arteries, in their cervical portion.

6)EEG ([**1-27**]): diffuse encephalopathy
