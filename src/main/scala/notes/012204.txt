Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Left Lower Lobe Collapse

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy, Flexible bronchoscopy, Stoma revision and
tracheostomy tube exchange

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60 year old male with a history of COPD,
chronic respiratory failure, s/p trach in [**2155**], s/p Y stent for
TBM and s/p Y stent removal (initially placed [**12-25**]- removed for
persistent moderate stenosis at the end of [**2176-3-15**] with
granulation tissue distal to stent) presents for workup of a
left lung opacification on a chest xray [**2176-4-25**] and plan for
repeat bronchoscopy on [**2176-4-29**].  He currently feels well, has
noticed no change in his respiratory status.  He denies any
pain, no abd pain, has a rectal flexi-seal and a foley so is
unaware of urinary sx or bowel habit changes.  No chest pain, no
confusion, fevers or chills.  He is thirsty and would like a
sleeping medication.

Given the patients trach history is limited.

Of note the patient was admitted for 4 days at [**Hospital1 **] for trach
dislodgement and cardiopulmonary arrest thought to be related to
this, discharged [**4-17**].

[**4-28**] portable CXR: Tip of the new tracheostomy tube is midline,
approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Right lung is clear, but
left lower lobe remains collapsed, left bronchial tree is
largely opacified suggesting endobronchial secretions, and
atelectasis in the lingula and upper lobe has worsened. Some
left pleural effusion is presumed. Heart size is indeterminate
because of marked leftward mediastinal shift and obscuration of
the left heart border. Nasogastric tube passes below the
diaphragm and out of view. No right pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.



Brief Hospital Course:
-Left lung opacification: CXR consistent with collapse. Patient
underwent flexible and rigid bronchoscopy for evaluation of
opacification on [**4-29**]. The operative report describes a crowded
oropharynx and normal larynx. The tracheostomy stoma appeared
healthy and without excess granulation tissue or stenosis.  The
airways demonstrated minimal granulation tissue in the trachea
and the right main stem bronchus and mild granulation tissue on
the left main stem bronchus without significant airway
compromise.  There was very severe diffuse tracheobronchomalacia
most pronounced at the left lower lobe orifice without evidence
of endobronchial lesion.  At the completion of the proceudre, a
new PleurX Portex Per-Fit #7 cuffed non-fenestrated tracheostomy
tube was placed.  At the instruction of the Interventional
Pulmonary team, the patient's PEEP was increased to 10 at
discharge.  Also, his ventilator settings at discharge were:
AC/500/18/10/50%.  Sputum gram stain demonstrated 4+ GPR and 3+
GNR, there was no growth at the time of discharge.  He was not
treated with additional antibiotics as he just completed a
course and had no suggestion of ongoing infection. He will have
an outpatient clinic appointment with the IP and thoracic
surgery teams in 3 weeks in preparation for planned
tracheobronchoplasty.  He will require cardiac clearance for the
procedure, per the Thoracic Surgery team.  The Interventional
Pulmonary team also recommended weaning of the minute
ventilation, and outpatient GERD evaluation.

-Mr. [**Known lastname **] was otherwise continued on all other pre-admission
medications. He does require appointments with the IP team to be
scheduled 3 weeks from discharge and also for cardiac clearance
prior to his upcoming procedure.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 5070**] secretary will
make arrangements for these appointments. Please call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**] for confirmation and times of appointments.
Appointments were in coordination at the time of discharge.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome
Chronic renal insufficiency
Restless leg syndrome
Gout
Chronic Diastolic Heart failure


Discharge Condition:
Stable. On ventilator at AC/500/18/10/50%.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a bronchoscopy and airway evaluation given
the changes in your chest Xray.  Your tracheostomy tube was
exchanged during the procedure.  You will follow up shortly for
repeat flexible bronchoscopy and plan for tracheobronchoplasty.

There were no medication changes on this hospitalization.

Vent settings at discharge were AC/500/18/10/50%.  See Discharge
summary for tracheostomy tube description.  PEEP was increased
in an attempt to open the collapsed lower lobe, as per the
Interventional Pulmonary team.

Please follow up as below.

Followup Instructions:
-Your previously scheduled [**2176-5-7**] appointments are being
rescheduled.  The new appointment times are currently in
coordination--see discha
