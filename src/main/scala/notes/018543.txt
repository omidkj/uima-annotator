Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for urgent cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Central venous line placement (subclavian)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year-old man with a history of DM, HTN, HL but
no known CAD, who initially presented to an OSH with shortness
of breath on [**12-27**] who is now being transferred with a STEMI.

Per the OSH records (no history could be obtained from the
patient as he is intubated): Presented on [**12-27**] with two weeks
of cough and dyspnea. Seen by his PCP and was given tylenol with
codeine. On the day of admission, had worsened SOB and cough
with white sputum. No fevers. Also with chest pain, reportedly
from coughing. Noted to have ARF (SCr of 1.5 on admit) with a
lactate of 1.6. CK and troponin were negative. BNP was 386. CXR
showed RLL PNA and he was treated with levaquin.

On HD#2, at 7pm, noted by to be SOB and wheezing. O2 sat <80%
and placed on NRB after which time he became unresponsive with
reported right eye gaze and questionable weakness of the RUE. An
ABG was done and showed 7.03/106/297 (on NRB) and he was
intubated. Soon after, BP 220/113 with a HR of 114.

Labs later returned with a CK of 186, MB 10.2, trop T 0.495. ECG
showed sinus tach. Aspirin then increased to 325 and
atorvastatin 80 given. A head CT was ordered before heparin was
administered. At 4:30am on day of transfer patient was
hypotensive with ECG showing ?STEMI. Neosynephrine was started.
He is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cardiac catheterization,
on Neo, insulin, and heparin gtts.

Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] showed: Two vessel coronary
artery disease.
Diastolic dysfunction with severely elevated filling pressures.
Stenting of mid LAD with two overlapping BMS.

Imaging/Studies:

ECG 12.17: Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. There are tiny R
waves in the anterior leads consistent with possible prior
anterior infarction. There is ST segment elevation in the
lateral and anterolateral leads with ST segment depression in
the inferior leads consistent with acute myocardial infarction.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

C. Catheterization [**12-29**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. STEMI.
2. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
3. Diastolic dysfunction with severely elevated filling
pressures.
4. Successful stenting of the mid LAD with two overlapping BMS.

CXR 12.17:
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:

Heterogeneous peribronchial infiltration in the lower lungs,
right greater
than left could be due to asymmetric edema, but alternatively,
given the
presence of partially calcified pleural thickening along the
right lower
costal margin could be due to overlying pleural abnormality.
Upper lungs are clear, and free of either vascular congestion or
edema. There is no layering pleural effusion. Heart size is
normal. ET tube in standard placement, an ascending pulmonary
floatation catheter tip projects over the left pulmonary artery
at the origin of the descending portion, nasogastric tube passes
into the stomach and out of view and a right subclavian line can
be traced as far as the low right atrium. No pneumothorax.

ECG [**12-30**]:
Sinus rhythm. ST segment elevation in the anterior and
anterolateral leads
with terminal T wave inversion and more modest ST-T wave changes
in the
remaining leads consistent with evolving myocardial infarction.
Compared to
the previous tracing evidence of evolution is now present.
Clinical
correlation is suggested.

ECHO [**12-31**]:
The left atrium is elongated. A small secundum atrial septal
defect is present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF
