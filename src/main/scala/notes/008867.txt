Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old with longstanding severe COPD who is an
ex-smoker, ex-IVDU, with multiple COPD exacerbations and
multiple intubations for respiratory failure in the past. He has
right hemidiaphragm dysfunction and he underwent tracheal stent
placement in [**2124-8-9**] for tracheal stenosis. He presents to
the ED today from his rehab facility one day after discharge
from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**8-7**] for similar SOB complaints stating that he felt
very uncomfortable and short of breath after midnight last night
and had trouble sleeping. In the ED today wheezes were
auscultated on lung exam and he was tachypneic with RR 30 but
saturation still at 100% on 5L via trach collar. He was given
125mg solumedrol IV, Combivent nebulizers and his CXR in ED
today was largely unchanged from [**8-7**] CXR which reidentified
[**Hospital1 **]-basilar effusions, and revealed no evidence of any new
infiltrates or pneumothoraces. He was also given 5mg Valium, 1mg
Versed, and Morphine 4mg IV x2 for c/o back pain and anxiety.
He was placed back on a ventilator for support and transferred
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] this afternoon for further workup and observation. He is
currently on A/C vent, TV 600, RR14, PEEP 5 and FI02 .50 with
96%-97% O2 saturations and in no apparent distress, very
somnolent.
As noted, the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
after a similar admission for shortness of breath experienced at
his rehab facility shortly after undergoing recent cryoablation
of some granulation tissue on the superior edge of his
tracheostomy site by the IP team here at [**Hospital1 18**]. After this
procedure he became acutely bronchospastic, desatting to low-mid
80's and despite several nebulizer treatments he only rose up to
low 90s saturations. It was felt that he became bronchospastic
in the setting of some chemical irritation from mild bleeding.
He was given supplemental O2 and eventually admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
with distress and hypoxia. During this last [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission from
[**Date range (1) 12474**] he was placed on MMV mode to help his periods of apnea
which were attributed to recent increase in his pain
medications. He was also treated for COPD exacerbation with IV
steroids, frequent MDI's, and azithromycin.

ROS: The patient denies any fevers, diarrhea, nausea, chills,
vomiting, abdominal pain, melena, chest pain/palpitaions,
orthopnea, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency,
urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, focal weakness, vision
changes or headaches. positive ROS items include chronic back
pain, bilateral lower extremeity pain secondary to recent
cellulitis infection.

Past Medical History:
1) Severe O2-dependent COPD
2) Tracheal stenosis s/p stent, stent removal, dilatation, and
tracheostomy insertion [**Month (only) 205**]-[**2124-8-9**] (Interventional pulmonology
notes report an "A"-shaped stenosis with tracheomalacia at the
level of the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings. The stenosis was
dilated with a rigid bronchoscope)
3) Diabetes mellitus type 2.
4) Osteoporosis.
5) Hepatitis B.
6) Chronic lower back pain, associated with mid-thoracic
vertebral compression fractures from osteoporosis(details
unknown).
7) Left 3rd finger amputation.
8) History of intravenous drug use.
9) multi-drug resistant pseudomonas infection, + MRSA sputum/
nasal swab
10) PUD hx of ulcers (gastric/duodenal)
11) chronic right hemidiaphragm elevation - phrenic n.
dysfunction


Social History:
Lives at [**Location **] [**Location **] rehab, extensive smoking history but
denies current smoking.  Drank heavily in past, last drink long
time ago.  h/o IVDU but has been clean for past 7 years, does
not need methadone maintenance.
