RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2115-5-21**] 10:52 AM

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE

Reason: ?carotid disease

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old woman found down -- syncopy work-up
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?carotid disease
STUDY: Carotid series complete.

REASON: Syncope.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries and no significant plaque seen bilaterally.

On the right, peak velocities are 63, 98, and 72 cm/sec in the
ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. This is consistent with no
stenosis.

On the left, peak velocities are 77, 99, and 98 cm/sec in the
ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. This is consistent with no
stenosis.

There is antegrade vertebral flow bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: Normal carotid study.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Aneurysmal
interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Normal IVC diameter with
<50% decrease
during respiration (estimated RAP 11-15mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. No
resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP. Mild
mitral annular calcification.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right
atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary
artery
systolic hypertension.
No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2115**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions
regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.
