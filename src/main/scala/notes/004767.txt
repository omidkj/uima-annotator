HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a history of CIS
of the bladder status post TURBT two years ago which had
pathology consistent with transitional cell carcinoma in the
prostatic urethra. The patient was treated with a six week course
BCG.  The patient had bladder biopsy which revealed CIS in

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was brought to the
operating room  on [**2114-5-14**]. He had a radical
cystoprostatectomy, urethrectomy, creation of continent
urinary diversion with right colon, bilateral pelvic lymph
node dissection.  The patient had two ureteral stents placed
along with two JP drains, an NG tube, a Mitrofanoff tube and
a rectal Penrose as well as an NG tube.

Postoperatively the patient was found to be difficult to
extubate and had a low blood pressure.  The patient was
therefore transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he
remained intubated and on pressers.  A Swan Ganz catheter was
placed for optimal fluid management. Peri-operative antibiotics
with Ampicillin, Gentamicin and Flagyl were given.

A cardiology consult was obtained and it was determined that
there was no evidence of cardiac ischemia.

The patient's sedation was gradually weaned over the next
couple of days in the ICU. The patient began to auto diurese
and the Swan Ganz catheter was removed. The patient was
finally extubated on [**2114-5-19**] which was postoperative
day five.  After extubation the patient was found to be
confused.

On [**2114-5-21**] which was postoperative day seven, a head
CT scan was obtained which revealed an old frontal stroke
with question as to the timing. Neurology consult was
obtained and it was recommended the patient be started on
aspirin. The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2114-5-21**] and at that time his NG tube was also removed.

By [**2114-5-23**] his JP drains had minimal output and these
were removed. The patient's mental status gradually improved
day by day. The patient was started on a five day course of
Flagyl because of  frequent loose bowel movements. A C difficile
sample was sent which was negative.

By [**2114-5-24**] the patient was working with Occupational
Therapy and Physical Therapy. Mental status had completely
cleared up. The patient was tolerating a regular diet by the
time of discharge and was afebrile throughout the admission.
On the day of discharge one of the ureteral
stents was removed and prior to this Gentamycin was given
through the stent and an oral dose of Levofloxacin was given.
