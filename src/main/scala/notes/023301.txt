Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was evaluated in the ED and brought emergently to the OR
where under general anesthesia a right craniectomy with
evacuation of subdural hematoma was performed.  Pt tolerated
this procedure and was transferred to the TICU for close
monitoring. Post op CT scan showed improvement.  He began
leaking CSF from his head, the head was oversewn and was
reddened he was started on triple antibiotics.  After a 10 day
course of antibiotics they were stopped with the exception of a
vancomycin for staph in his urine culture which grew out staph
on [**4-2**] we were planning a full days of Vanco for that
infection.  He did have staph also grow out of his sputum.

He had a lumbar drain placed for approximately 5 days which
stopped further drainage from his head wound.  His sutures were
removed and the redness in the wound decreased on daily basis he
has slight erythema but it is greatly improved.

There were focal seizures during early hospitalisation. The
patient was treated with dilantin and transitioned to
levetiracetam he has no further seizures.

Peg and trach were placed on [**2192-3-25**]. Discharge from the PEG
site has been noted but no erthyema was noted, our surgical team
was consulted and they felt it was normal drainage and they
would only become concerned if it developed erythema.

The patient was covered with heparin for drain removal and
coumadin restarted for anticoagulation in view of [**Hospital3 **]
valve.  His goal INR is 2.5 he is being bridged from Heparin to
Coumadin.  On [**4-5**] his last INR was 1.2  He had a PICC line
placed for Heparin and IV Vancomycin on [**4-4**].

He was transferred to the floor on [**2192-4-2**]. The patient was
reviewed by PT and OT.  He has been interactive with staff
following intermittent commands, spontaneously moving right side
very briskly/sponteously.  He does move the left side with some
weakness 3-4 in both arm and leg.  He appears more
responsive/engaging with family

On discharge he was started on a bladder clamping/training
program.

The patient had a craniectomy and must wear helmut whenever out
of bed.
