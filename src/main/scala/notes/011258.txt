Service:  GENERAL S.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal sepsis, perforated cecum, status
post right hemicolectomy, ileostomy, and mucous fistula.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63-year-old
gentleman, who was transferred from the [**Hospital 28978**] Medical Center for surgical treatment of spinal
stenosis and posterior herniation of T2 to T3.  He was
admitted to the Neurosurgery Service.  He had a one-year
history of ataxia with multiple visits to the Neurologist and
Neurosurgeon.  MRI in [**2177-10-9**] showed a stenosis at the
T2 to T3 level.  He also had increasing leg weakness and
increased urinary incontinence prior to presentation to the
emergency department.

On the Neurosurgery Service, he underwent a T2 to T3
decompression laminectomy on [**2178-6-18**] without any
intraoperative complication.  Repeat CT scan showed the need
for further decompression.  He also went into atrial
fibrillation spontaneously.  He was seen by the Department of
Cardiology.  He converted spontaneously back to sinus rhythm
and had no further problems with atrial fibrillation.  He was
started on a beta blocker 25 mg PO b.i.d. at that time.  He
had a revision T2 laminectomy on [**2178-6-25**], which showed no
intraoperative complications.

The patient complained of constipation.  He received daily
bowel regimens of Lactulose, Senna, and Colace.  He received
magnesium citrate times two and he had a bowel movement on
[**2178-7-1**] and [**2178-7-2**].  However, no [**2178-7-2**], he was noted
to be more distended on examination.  KUB was normal.  Rectal
tube was placed.  However, later in the day, he had increased
distention, tachycardia, and then hypotension.  He was
transferred to the MICU at this time.  Chest x-ray and KUB
showed free air in the abdomen.  The Department of Surgery
was consulted at this time and then the patient was taken to
the operating room after resuscitation, at which time he was
found to have a cecum perforation.  Free stool and fibrinous
exudate were also found in the peritoneal cavity.  He
received a right hemicolectomy, ileostomy and mucous fistula
were performed.

2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  History of atrial fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to ATIVAN AND COZAAR.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was seen in the MICU by
the consultation team.  Vital signs:  99.3, 120, 94/65, 29.
The patient is confused.  He is awake.  CARDIAC:  Regular
rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  LUNGS:  Lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:
Impressively distended, tympanic, nontender, no bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm.  He has 1+ peripheral pulses bilaterally.
He has 2+ edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2178-7-2**] for abdominal sepsis and perforated cecum.  He
received a right hemicolectomy, ileostomy, and mucous
fistula.  Please refer to the operative note for more
information.  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Intensive Care Unit postoperatively, where he was continued
with fluid resuscitation, blood products, and pressors, while
monitoring for arrhythmias.  Immediately, postoperatively, he
required Levophed to keep his blood pressure up.  He went
into atrial fibrillation and IV Lopressor was given, which
converted him to sinus rhythm and he was kept intubated with
NG tube in place.  He was placed on Flagyl and Imipenem along
with Vancomycin and Fluconazole.

On postoperative day #1, the patient's atrial fibrillation
continued, which was treated with an Amiodarone drip.  The
patient was also on Levophed drip, Ativan drip, and a
Dilaudid drip.  The patient was kept intubated and sedation.
A Nutrition consultation was requested.  Peritoneal fluid
from the operation showed 2+ Gram-positive rods, 2+
Gram-negative rods, and 1+ yeast.  Culture grew back
enterococcus.  The patient's atrial fibrillation persisted.

On postoperative day #4, cardiac output declined somewhat and
the dobutamine drip was started, which improved cardiac
output.  Also, Vancomycin was stopped at that time and
Ampicillin was started, continued along with the Imipenem,
Flagyl, and Fluconazole for the patient's sepsis.  TPN was
started for nutritional support.

Cardiology consultation was obtained to assess the patient's
cardiac status.  Recommendations were to discontinue the
Amiodarone and Dobutamine, to rate control with beta
blockers, and to get an echocardiogram to assess left
ventricular function.  He was started on Heparin for
anticoagulation.

Nutritionally, the patient was continued on TPN, however, a
post pyloric tube feed was placed, and he was started on
trophic feeds.

Over the next few days, in the ICU, the Ativan was weaned
down slowly.  However, the dobutamine was needed to increase
cardiac index.  The tube feeds were increased to provide
adequate nutrition for the patient.  The patient was on
insulin drip to keep the sugars under control.

By postoperative day #8, the patient was stable, off
dobutamine and the Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued.  The
patient continued in atrial fibrillation, however, this was
rate controlled with IV Lopressor.

On postoperative day #10, the patient had a run of
ventricular tachycardia, about 12 beats, but there was no
drop in systolic blood pressure.  He self converted.  There
was no hyponatremia.  He was continued with the Lopressor and
increased on the Diltiazem and not started on Amiodarone
until discussing with the Department of Cardiology.
Cardiology consultation was obtained at which point he was
started on an Amiodarone drip.  They also recommended
heparin, however, heparin was not started because the patient
was so critically ill and the risk for bleeding was still
high.

Cultures came back from the blood that showed Gram-positive
cocci and all lines were changed.  This then grew out Staph
coagulase negative and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The patient's
Ampicillin was stopped at this time and Vancomycin was
started along with his Imipenem, Flagyl, and Fluconazole,
which were continued.

On postoperative day #13, the patient received
transesophageal echocardiogram, which showed no intracardiac
thrombus.  It showed some trace MR, trivial AI, and trace TR,
otherwise, LV and RV systolic function were preserved.

The patient, soon, spontaneously converted back to sinus
rhythm and he was soon after changed to PO Amiodarone.

Around postoperative day #13, it was noted that there was an
ascitic fluid drainage from the wound and the wound began to
dehiscence on the abdomen.  Over the next few days in the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient's wound completely dehisced
and the wound was started to be treated with wet-to-dry
dressing of normal saline soaked gauze.  For this time, the
patient continued on p.r.n. Dilaudid and Ativan with
decreased mental status, however, he began to become more
awakened and coherent.

On postoperative day #15, the patient had increased
requirements of the vent secondary to tachycardia.  At this
point, he was only on Vancomycin for antibiotics, as the
Imipenem, Fluconazole, and Flagyl had been given for a
two-week course.

Around postoperative day #17, the patient spontaneously
converted to atrial fibrillation SVT with vagal maneuvers
attempted and cardiology consultation obtained.  The patient
was stable throughout.  He was restarted on an Amiodarone
drip.  He also spiked a temperature at this time.  On
postoperative day #18, the pressures dropped.  He was started
on Neo-Synephrine drip, Ceftazidime, and Gentamicin
empirically and he was cultured.  Cultures from the sputum
showed Pseudomonas and he was switched to Amikacin.

On [**2178-7-22**], after the patient resolved from
