Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Codeine / Amoxicillin / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
aphasia and right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVtPA at OSH, IAtPA, MERCI and PENUMBRA device applications at
[**Hospital1 18**].

History of Present Illness:
per admitting resident:

The patient is an 80 year old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation s/p PPM not on Coumadin due to fall risk,
hypertension, and perforated diverticulitis s/p ex lap and
sigmoidectomy [**2173-9-6**] who was last seen normal at 12:00 pm who
presented to an OSH with stuttering symptoms of aphasia and
right
sided weakness who received IV tPA at 2:13 pm and was
transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible further intervention, called as a CODE
STROKE. She is accompanied by her daughter and son.

Per the patient's daughter, the patient was last seen normal at
12:00 pm when she left the house to walk to the post-office to
drop off her [**Holiday **] cards. Apparently, a woman had found her
mother down and called EMS. Approximately 30 minutes later, EMS
knocked on the daughter's door (as the patient was able to say
her address at that time). After that, the patient had decreased
conversation, and was awake but "like a drunk." En route to
hospital had an episode of right sided flaccidity that lasted
1-2
minutes. At [**Hospital3 **], her daughter says that she became more
aware, and was talking for an approximately 3 minute period
(asking for her coat) before receiving tPA, but then became
aphasic again.

She was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **]. On initial arrival to ED
at 1:17 am she was talking, answering questions, and had an
intact neuro exam. Within about 5 minutes her clinical status
deteriorated and she developed aphasia, dysarthria, right facial
droop, and right sided weakness UE>LE. On exam, she had left
gaze
preference, right facial droop, right sided neglect, aphasia,
dysarthria, unable to hold RUE against gravity, RLE [**5-9**]. NIHSS
16. Labs showed INR 1.0, WBC 8.1, Hct 37.6, plt 277, Na 138, K
3.9, Cl 100, glucose 133, BUN 21, Cr 1.0, Ca 9.6, Mg 1.4, Phos
3.8, alk phos 310, ALT 39, AST 32, CK 47, CKMB 1.8. Neurology
was
consulted, and head CT/CTA showed prelim no acute bleed,
proximal
left ICA occlusion with slow flow to M1 and M2 branches, likely
occlusion of left MCA. tPA was bolused at 2:13 pm, with no
significant improvement in her symptoms after tPA bolus. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible IA tPA or embolectomy.

A CODE STROKE was called at 16:36 pm, and Neurology was
immediately at the bedside. Per the ED, the EKG also showed some
T-wave inversions.

NIHSS Score:
1a. LOC: 0
1b. LOC Questions: 2
1c. Commands: 1 (squeezes left hand, but does not close eyes)
2. Best Gaze: 0

5. Motor Arm: 3 (right)
6. Motor Leg: 2 (right)
7. Limb Ataxia: X
8. Sensory: X
9. Best Language: 2 (almost completely globally aphasic, but
does
try to make a few vocal utterances: no, I don't know)
10. Dysarthria: 2
11. Extinction/Neglect: X
NIHSS Score Total: 16

Social History:
She lives at home with her daughter, and does not
use a cane or walker at baseline. She is a former seamstress,
but
had to stop working after her right arm/wrist fracture 5 years
ago. She works part-time as a lunch monitor at an elementary
school. She does not use cigarettes, EtOH, or illicit drugs.

Family History:
There is no family history of strokes.


Physical Exam:
Physical Examination:
VS: temp 97.4, bp 138/85, HR 67, RR 22, SaO2 94% on RA
Genl: Awake, alert
HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection, oropharynx
clear
CV: Irregularly irregular rate, Nl S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops
Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly and laterally, no wheezes,
rhonchi, rales
Abd: +BS, soft, NTND abdomen, surgical scar on abdomen

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, occasionally follows commands
(squeezes hand on the left and breathes in and out for chest
auscultation, however she will not protrude her tongue or close
her eyes). Unable to name. Unable to read (but does say "I don't
know"). Intermittently says "no" and makes rare other vocal
utterances. Unable to say her age or the month. No dysarthria
when she does speak.

Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to
2 mm bilaterally. Blinks to threat on the left but not the
right.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally with limited upgaze.
Flat right NLF. Will not phonate to elevate palate. Will not
follow command to protrude tongue.

Motor: Normal tone bilaterally in UE and LE. No observed
myoclonus, asterixis, or tremor. She is able to keep her left
arm
against gravity for 10 seconds and her left leg against gravity
for 5 seconds (at least). Upon initialy exam, she has minimal
movement of her right arm when asked to lift it above gravity,
but does not sustain against gravity. Of note, when this
examiner
lifts her right arm against gravity she actively tries to push
it
down. However, 15 minutes later on repeat exam she is able to
briefly keep her right arm extended against gravity. However, 1+
hour after that she is again unable to lift her right arm
against
gravity and is more sleepy. She lifts her right leg against
gravity, but it drifts back to the bed in <5 seconds.

Sensation: She cannot cooperate with pinprick testing.

Reflexes: 3+ in right biceps/brachioradialis, 2+ on the left. 3+
and symmetirc in triceps and knees. Toes upgoing bilaterally
(but
more so on the right then left).

Gait: Deferred
