EXTREMITIES:  Warm with no peripheral edema, limited mobility
of the left arm secondary to a humeral fracture.  No

LABS:  All labs are pending.  Electrocardiogram is a V-paced
rhythm.  Chest x-ray is also pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is to be admitted as a
postoperative admission for coronary artery bypass graft AVR
on [**2113-5-8**].  As stated previously, the patient was
postoperative admit.  On [**5-8**], she was admitted to the
Operating Room at which time she underwent coronary artery
bypass graft x2 with a saphenous vein graft to the LAD and
saphenous vein graft to distal RCA, as well as an aortic
valve replacement with a #19 pericardial valve.  Please see
the Operating Room report for full details.  The patient was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit with an open chest.  At that time, she
had epinephrine at 0.5 mcg per kg per minute, Levophed at 0.1
mcg per kg per minute, propofol, ............ and
.............  The patient also had an anterior aortic
balloon pump in place at 1 to 1.  Upon arrival in the CSRU,
the patient was noted to have bright red blood per
nasogastric tube.  The gastrointestinal service was
consulted and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done.
Unfortunately, the patient was unstable during the
esophagogastroduodenoscopy and the procedure had to be
aborted before completion.  No source of gastrointestinal
bleeding was noted in the stomach.  Blood was pooled in the
cardia.  There was no blood in the antrum or the duodenum.

During her cardiac procedure and subsequent upper
gastrointestinal bleed, the patient received a total of 13
units of packed red blood cells, 12 units of platelets and 10
units of fresh frozen plasma on the day of her surgery.  Over
the next several days, the patient remained in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit sedated and paralyzed.
Hemodynamically, she continued to slowly improve and was
weaned from some of her cardioactive drugs.  On postoperative
day 3, she returned to the Operating Room.  At that time, her
balloon pump remained in place,however she was able to have
her chest closed.  She returned from the Operating Room to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit again with propofol,
Neo-Synephrine and intra-aortic balloon pump at 1 to 1.  This
patient was hemodynamically stable upon arrival to
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for the course of the
evening and night.  Following closure, the patient was weaned
from all cardioactive drugs.  On the morning of postoperative
day 4 and 1, she was weaned from the intra-aortic balloon
pump which was ultimately discontinued without any
hemodynamic compromise.  Following the removal of the
intra-aortic balloon pump, all sedation was discontinued.

The patient was weaned from full support mechanical
ventilation to pressure support ventilation.  Neurologically,
the patient was slow to awaken for her sedation.  She as
initially unresponsive and over the next several days,
regained the ability to follow commands.  Two days following
chest closure, the patient's chest tubes were removed.  On
postoperative day 3 and 6, the patient's Swan-Ganz catheter
was removed.  On postoperative 7 and 4, the patient was
transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for continuing postoperative
care in an Intensive Care Unit environment.  Over the next
several days, the patient was slowly weaned from pressure
support ventilation and ultimately on [**5-19**], she was
successfully extubated.  Following extubation, the patient
remained in the Intensive Care Unit where we closely
monitored her respiratory status.  Several days following
extubation a swallow study was performed which the patient
felt initial plans were made to have a PEG placed, however,
decision was made not to place PEG.  Her nasogastric feeding
tube was changed to a Dobbhoff tube.  The patient remained in
the Intensive Care Unit throughout the rest of her hospital
course due to weakness and her high risk of aspiration.

On [**5-30**], it was decided that [**Last Name (un) 12315**] as stable and ready for
transfer to rehabilitation center of continuing postoperative
care and cardiac rehabilitation.  At the time of transfer,
the patient's physical exam is as follows:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.1??????, heart rate 90 AV placed,
blood pressure 155/75, respiratory rate 24, Os2 %100 on 2
liters nasal oxygen.  Weight preoperatively is 89.5 pounds,
at discharge it s 116 pounds.

LAB DATA ON [**5-30**]:  White count 8.6, hematocrit 34, platelets
168, od 147, potassium 3.9, chloride 102, CO2 28,  BUN 33,
creatinine 0.4, glucose 137.  Chloride 111, CO2 28, BUN 33,
creatinine 0.4.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
GENERAL:  Alert and responsive, follows some commands.
RESPIRATORY:  Breath sounds clear to auscultation on the
right, no breath sounds on the left.
COR:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2.
