Service:

ADDENDUM:  The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit on
decreasing levels of pressure support ventilation which she
has tolerated well.  This morning, she was on continuous
positive airway pressure mode with 5 of positive
end-expiratory pressure and 10 of pressure support.  Upon
weaning her pressure support from 10 to 8, she did become
tachypneic and dropped her tidal volumes into the 200 range
and was therefore placed back to a pressure support of 10.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Acetaminophen 325 mg by mouth q.4h. as needed (for a
temperature above 38 degrees Celsius).
 2.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Ranitidine 150 mg by mouth twice per day.
 4.  Colace 150 mg/15 mL one by mouth twice per day.
 5.  Combivent meter-dosed inhaler 1 to 2 puffs q.6h.
 6.  Flagyl 500 mg by mouth three times per day (for seven
more days).
 7.  Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day (to hold for a
systolic blood pressure of less than 100 or a heart rate of
less than 60).
 8.  Miconazole powder applied three times per day as needed.
 9.  Amiodarone 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
10.  Vancomycin 1 g intravenously q.24h. (for three more
weeks upon discharge).
11.  Diamox 250 mg by mouth three times per day (for three
doses upon discharge); following that, the patient had
previously been on Lasix.  Her need for ongoing diuretics
should be assessed on a daily basis.  She did have a bit of a
metabolic alkalosis today and that is why her Lasix was
discontinued and Diamox was initiated.
