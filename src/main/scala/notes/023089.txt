History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis
secondary to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and
varices (never bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who
presented on [**11-10**] with AMS presumed due to hepatic
encephalopathy, now admitted to the MICU with upper GI bleeding.
This evening she had a bloody stool followed by hematemesis of 2
cupfuls of blood. She remained hemodynamically stable (BP 100s,
HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and lavage revealed blood and
clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT returned at 29.6
(from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
endoscopy.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she [**Month/Year (2) 12861**] some lightheadedness, but
denied CP or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was
placed and the first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented
for EGD, but as the procedure was beginning, she vomited a very
large amount of BRB and clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more
units were rapidly transfused and she was urgently intubated for
airway protection. Peripheral phenylephrine was also briefly
started. After a total of 5 units of pRBCs were tranfused, BP
had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily turned off. Repeat
endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the esophagus
and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices due
to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
tube was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for
urgent TIPS.

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to the ICU, Ms [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12861**] some lightheadedness,
but denied CP or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV
was placed and the first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was
consented for EGD, but as the procedure was beginning, she
vomited a very large amount of BRB and clot. BP dropped to
80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and she was
urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units
of pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so
phenylephrine easily turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed
continued blood welling up into the esophagus and filling the
stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices due to amount of
blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube was
placed. IR and anesthesia were consulted for urgent TIPS which
was successfully performed. Bleeding stopped and HCT's were
trended and remained stable. On CXR, a widened mediastinum was
noted and a CT scan of the neck and torso were performed which
did not show any evidence of disection, esophogeal perforation
or evidence of complication from TIPS. After several hours of
stable HCT, the esophogeal balloon was deflated and removed.
Once stabilized, Ms [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the floor for
further management.  While on the floor, she required diuresis
secondary to multiple blood products received in the ICU.  Lasix
and spirinolactone were given.  She had persistent leukocytosis
and received a diagnostic tap which was consistent with SBP.
She was started on zosyn given her prior ceftriaxone course with
question of cephalosporin resistant organisms; her white count
mildly improved while on zosyn, however following
discontinuation of antibiotics, her white count climbed > 20.  A
chest x-ray showed worsening consolidation so she was started on
treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia. During treatment of
her SBP, her renal function started to deteriorate with
creatinine rising persistently > 2.0.  Treatment for HRS was
initiated with octreotide, albumin, and midodrine, however renal
function persistently deteriorated.  Given worsening renal
function, a decision was made to transition her care to home
with hospice.
