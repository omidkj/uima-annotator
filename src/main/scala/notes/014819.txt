HPI:
The pt is a 66 year-old R-handed woman with a history of HTN,
HL,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy s/p PM/ICD on coumadin, CHF, COPD,
and a small bowel mass s/p recent biopsy as well as colonoscopy
with polypectomy [**5-8**] who presents as a code stroke with acute
onset L sided weakness. Her daughter reports that she was in her
usual state of health throughout the day today and when she
dropped her off at her house shortly before 8pm. The patient's
sister was at home with her when suddenly around 8:10pm she
noticed a "change" in her face and slurred speech. She called
EMS
and the patient was brought to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital. Upon arrival she
was found to have a left facial droop and weakness of her left
arm and leg. CT head was unremarkable. Neurology was consulted
and felt uncomfortable giving IV tPA due to her recent
colonoscopy with subsequent black stools. She was therefore
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and possible
interventional procedure.

Upon arrival to our ED a code stroke was called. Initial NIHSS
was 7 with exam significant for left facial droop, mild
dysarthria, 3-4/5 weakness in L arm and leg, decreased sensation
to pinprick over L hemibody, and extinction on DSS on L. CT head
was negative for acute process or signs of ischemia. CTA showed
acute occlusive thrombus of R distal M1. CTP showed increased
MTT, decreased CBF/CBV in R MCA distribution.

Upon further history the patient reports that she began having
bloody stool immediately after the colonoscopy on [**5-8**] during
which [**2-15**] polyps were removed. By the next day her stools were
black and this continued until yesterday, when she went back to
the hospital and had some blood drawn (her daughter thinks to
check her INR and blood count). She was told that these results
were normal. Today her stool appeared more brown but was
hemoccult positive in the ED. Of note she stopped taking
coumadin
on [**5-3**] prior to the procedure and has not yet restarted it.

She otherwise reports feeling well. Denies any prior strokes or
TIA's. Denies any recent headaches, changes in vision,
lightheadedness, numbness/tingling, difficulty walking.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills. +Chronic cough and SOB related to COPD. No chest pain.
Denies nausea, vomiting, +recent loose black stools since
colonoscopy on [**5-5**].

Given the risk of GI bleed and the overall relatively mild
severity of her deficits, tPA was not given. She was also not an
appropriate candidate for neurointervention given the overall
risks vs. benefits in the setting of her multiple comorbidities
and mild and improving deficits. During her ED course her left
sided weakness transiently worsened with a drop in her BP to
110-120 systolic. She was started on phenylephrine with increase
in BP to 130's with improvement in her exam. Given this the
decision was made to manage her medically with close observation
in the ICU with a goal SBP of 140-150. She was given aspirin
300mg PR in the ED.
