Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: s/p fall, hypoxia, agitation
.
Reason for MICU Admission: hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
staples to repair right forehead laceration


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of diastolic CHF, COPD, ?
dementia who presents from [**Hospital1 1501**] s/p fall. Patient was overtly
delirious on admission and unable to provide history.
Information was obtained from records provided.
.
Apparently patient was found on floor today with head
laceration, and it is unknown if LOC occurred. She was noted to
be anxious and agitated. According to HCP, patient [**Name2 (NI) 102738**]
becomes hypoxic when she becomes agitated. Given fall patient
was sent to ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 90 152/90 24 92% 4L Nasal Cannula.
Pt initially was very agitated and was given haldol 5 mg x 2, as
well as lorazepam 2 mg x 1. Primary trauma survey was
unremarkable. CXR was significant for bilateral pleural
effusions and possible evidence of pneumonia. CT of head and
C-spine was limited, but patient was cleared. Patient was given
vancomycin and levofloxacin for HCAP coverage and was also given
methylprednisolone 125mg x1 for COPD exacerbation. She also
received lasix 40 mg IV x 1, producing about 250 mL urine. The
patient's laceration was repaired. Tetanus shot was given to
patient. According to ED signout, patient became more hypoxic to
70s while agitated and was placed on NRB with recovery of sats
to low 90s. Attempts were made to place patient on BiPAP however
the patient did not tolerate this intervention. VS prior to
transfer were VS: 96.5, 91, 157/114, 30, 100% NRB. Patient was
placed on 4 point restraints prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient continued to be agitated and
immediately required another 0.5 mg lorazepam IV x 2. She
presented on non-rebreather and was unable to answer questions.

.
CT Head [**2148-8-16**]:  No acute intracranial process. Moderate-sized
hematoma overlying the left frontal bone. Evidence of prior
right frontoparietal craniotomy
.
CT CAP [**2148-8-16**]: 1. Exam is severely limited by motion. No
evidence of acute trauma. Multiple left-sided rib and transverse
process fractures identified with varying degrees of healing. No
acute fracture identified. Correlate with exam and mechanism.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Cardiomegaly.
4. Bilateral adrenal gland hyperplasia.
.
CT C-spine [**2148-8-16**]: 1. Severely limited exam. No evidence of
gross acute fracture or malalignment.
2. T2 compression deformity with morphology suggests chronicity
but no prior studies available for comparison.
.
CXR [**2148-8-16**]
Marked volume overload evident by moderate pulmonary edema,
likely cardiogenic in etiology. Recommend appropriate diuresis
and repeat
radiography to assess for underlying infection. There are at
least fractures involving the left third, fourth, and fifth
ribs. No pneumothorax is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of diastolic CHF and COPD who
presented with hypoxia and agitation.
.
# Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: Her admission CT chest was
fairly unremarkable. However, she spiked a fever and developed
bilateral infiltrates; she was started on Vanc, [**Last Name (un) 2830**], levo for
HCAP. Cultures were sent, but did not grow an organism. Her
antibiotics were tapered to levofloxacin only with the plan to
continue for an 8 day course for HCAP. She improved clinically
and had resolution of fevers on levofloxacin alone.
.
#Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt became somnolent in setting
of antipsychotics/benzos. Per discussion with her family and her
MD at rehab, there is a very narrow therapeutic window which
such medications in this patient.  PCO2 was grossly elevated
indicating hypoventilation.  She was placed on BiPAP with
improvement in mental status. Ativan was d/ced and only
risperidone (home med) was used to manage her anxiety. This a
uptitrated to 1.5mg nightly.
.
# Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemia hyponatremia after Lasix
given concentrated appearance of urine. Pt is taking good po
free water, and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3646**] at rehab will be monitoring lytes. She
appears euvolemic on exam and is at baseline mental status.
.
# S/P Fall with Head Laceration: Initial trauma survey negative.
Unremarkable CT head on admission.  Head laceration was repaired
in the ED. Will need staples removed 7 days from placement
(placed [**2148-8-16**]).
.
# Atrial fibrillation: patient not on anticoagulation given past
history of subdural hematoma.  She is also not currently on rate
control.  Heart rate was < 100 throughout her hospital stay.
.
Code status: DNR/DNI. The patient and her family would prefer
she stay at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and not come to the hospital. If there
is some issue that cannot be managed at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and the pt
is brought to the ED, they request she not be admitted to the
ICU in the future.

Medications on Admission:
Furosemide 60 mg PO d
