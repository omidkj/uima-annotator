Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
woman who presents after having a headache in the left
frontal area with hypertension. A head CT showed a left
frontal hemorrhage. The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] for close neurologic monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post gastric bypass in [**2140**],
right CEA for occlusion, no TIAs or strokes, an aortic valve
replacement 10 years ago. The patient is on Coumadin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's blood pressure was
178/50, heart rate was 73, respiratory rate was 24,
saturations were 98% on room air. Overall, well-appearing and
in no distress. Awake, alert, and oriented x 3.
Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and rhythm. A 1/6
systolic murmur. The lungs were clear to auscultation. The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended. No clubbing,
cyanosis or edema. Neurologically, speech was fluent. She was
awake, alert, and oriented x 3. The pupils were 3 down to 2.5
on the left and 2.5 down to 2 on the right. EOMs were full.
Disks were sharp. She did have a mild left facial droop. The
tongue was midline. Gag was intact. Strength was full at 5/5
in all muscle groups. She had no drift. Finger-to-nose was
intact. Gait was not tested.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU after a
head CT showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal
area. She had a CTA which showed a very small aneurysm on the
right side. Nowhere near where her bleed was. Not thought to
be the cause of bleeding, and there was no treatment needed
for that aneurysm. The patient had been on Coumadin for her
aortic valve replacement, and that will need to be restarted
before discharge. She remained neurologically stable and was
transferred to the regular floor on [**2165-7-4**]. She was out
of bed ambulating with physical therapy who felt she would
require 1 more day of physical therapy before discharge to
home on [**7-6**].

at the time of discharge.
