EKG [**2169-5-8**] NSR at 86. LBBB. Sinus bradycardia on [**2168-12-28**] EKG
resolved.

CXR [**2169-5-10**] No pneumothorax seen, Left posterior 9th rib fx not
visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
....Pt was admitted to the hospital from [**Hospital1 18**] ER on [**2169-5-8**].
Repeat CT showed 7.9
x 7.5cm infrarenal AAA, diffuse emphysema, and RML/RUL pulmonary
nodules up to 7mm.
The CXR did not visualize the left rib fx or any pneumothorax.
Pt denied new abdominal pain but c/o increased low back pain.
....Cardiology was consulted for pre-operative cardiac
clearance. Persantine MIBI
study done [**1-26**] showed EF of 32%, inferior fixed defect which
was unchanged from
[**1-24**]. Cardiac cath from [**10/2164**] was reviewed, found to be stable
and pt was cleared for surgery. Cardiology recommended
increasing beta blocker to attain HR of 50-60.
However pt became bradycardic to HR~35 so dose changed back to
at home dose.
....Since admission pt's O2 saturation hovered at ~90%. Pt was
followed by his PCP,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], who thought this was due to splinting from rib
fracture pain and low
back pain. The Acute Pain Service was consulted regarding pt's
back pain which had
unsuccessfully treated with morphine PCA. Pt's AAA resection was
rescheduled in
order to address respiratory and pain issues adequately.
....On [**2169-5-15**] pt underwent an uneventful AAA resection with an
aortobi-iliac BPG.
At the end of surgery pt had equally warm feet with palpable
femoral and dopplerable
pedal pulses. Ancef was given peri-operatively. One unit of PRBC
was transfused on
POD#2. Post-op pain was managed with hydromorphone epidural
until POD#2 and then
pain was controlled with morphine PCA and finally Percocet prn.
....Pt started on sips on POD#3 and diet was advanced as
tolerated. Physical therapy
cleared pt for discharge home. At time of discharge pt's
abdominal incision was
clean, dry, and intact. He will f/u with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in th
office in one week
for staple removal.
