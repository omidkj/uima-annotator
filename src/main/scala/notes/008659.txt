Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for dialysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Quinton cath placement
temporary dialysis line placement
tunnelled line placement
pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
73yoW with history CHF, hypertension, hypothyroidism,
hyperlipidemia, multiple PEs, and type II diabetes mellitus
complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, and renal failure who
was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with worsening renal
function and need for hemodialysis.  She was admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital [**2115-2-4**], treated for a CHF exacerbation, and discharged
to home.  She was again admitted [**2115-2-11**] to [**Hospital **] Hospital
with complaints of neck pain, abdominal discomfort, and nausea.
Neck pain was diagnosed as muscle spasm, treated with flexeril,
and improved.  Hospital course, however, has been complicated by
worsening renal function with elevated creatinine and BUN.
Creatinine on admission was 4.1, and rose to 6.1 during her
hospitalization.  She was treated with gentle iv fluids, but
became fluid overloaded and required diuresis with lasix.  MRA
of the kidneys at [**Location (un) **] also showed bilateral 30% renal artery
stenosis.
.
During her hospital course she was treated for a UTI with a
single dose of iv levofloxacin.  Urine culture grew only mixed
flora.  Nausea was treated with Protonix and Reglan as there was
concern for gastroparesis.  She was to have a swallow evaluation
but this was not done prior to transfer.  During her previous
hospitalization, she had ruled out for MI.  She was to have a
cardiac cath, but this was postponed in the setting of worsening
renal function.  She had a perfusion imaging stress [**Doctor Last Name **] [**2115-2-6**]
that showed posterior and anteroseptal ischemia with mild LV
dilation and normal EF.  V/Q scan [**2-11**] was high probability for
PE, despite being anticoagulated on coumadin.
.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] she complains of
dizziness/lightheadedness, occasional chills, back pain and
constipation.  She denies fevers, sweats, visual changes, chest
pain, palpitations, SOB, cough, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, arthralgias, myalgias,
and skin changes.

Past Medical History:

RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

AV FITULOGRAM SCH  [**2115-3-12**] 7:25 AM

AV FITULOGRAM SCH

Reason: evaluate fistula patency
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old woman with ESRD, left AV fistula
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate fistula patency
HISTORY: 73-year-old female with end-stage renal disease and
left upper extremity AV fistula with poor flows at hemodialysis.

PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name 19595**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 19595**], the
staff radiologist, was present and supervising throughout. After
the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was
placed supine on the angiography table. Her left upper extremity
was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A
physical examination was performed, revealing a palpable thrill
throughout the native fistula. Through an anesthetized skin
approach, the fistula was accessed in the outflow direction
using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. A 0.018 guide wire was
advanced through the access needle into the outflow cephalic
vein under fluoroscopic visualization. The skin entry site was
incised with a #11 blade scalpel. The access needle was replaced
with a 4-French micropuncture dilator.

After the guide wire was removed, a fistulogram was performed
via injection of nonionic contrast. This revealed a patent and
large outflow cephalic vein with no evidence of thrombus,
stenosis, or occlusion. There is antegrade opacification of the
left brachial vein via a few small collateral branches from the
outflow cephalic vein at the level of the mid-arm. Further
imaging reveals free passage of contrast from the outflow
cephalic vein into the left subclavian and brachiocephalic veins
along with the superior vena cava and right heart with no
evidence of central stenosis or occlusion. After a blood
pressure cuff was inflated, a repeat injection was performed to
evaluate the arterial inflow. This revealed a mild stenosis at
the brachial artery- cephalic vein anastomosis. However, there
is antegrade flow into the brachial artery distal to the
anastomosis, with brisk flow throughout the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this is
likely insignificant. Following the procedure, the micropuncture
sheath was removed from the fistula and manual pressure was held
until hemostasis was achieved. A dry sterile dressing was
applied.

COMPLICATIONS: None.

MEDICATIONS: 1% lidocaine.

CONTRAST: 75 cc of full-strength Optiray 320.

IMPRESSION: Left upper extremity fistulogram revealed a patent
native brachiocephalic fistula with good inflow and no evidence
of thrombosis, obstruction, or stenosis within the outflow
cephalic vein, subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein and
superior vena cava with free passage of contrast into the right
heart. A mild stenosis is present at the arterial anastomosis.
However, given the brisk flow present, this is likely
insignificant.
