[**2168-2-29**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis 40-59% (low end). Left
ICA stenosis <40%.

[**2168-3-1**] CTA TORSO: 1. Extensive noncircumferential calcified
atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta, aortic arch and
descending aorta. No evidence of porcelain aorta, aneurysm or
dissection. 2. Severe aortic valve calcification and markedly
decrease aortic valve excursion with an orifice area of 68.3mm2
at systole. Pre-operative transcatheter aortic valve replacement
measurements are described in this report. 2. Moderate bilateral
pleural effusion and interstitial as well as alveolar pulmonary
edema and cardiomegaly consistent with CHF. Pulmonary arterial
enlargement may be a secondary phenomenon. 3. Subcentimeter
hypodense lesion in the liver is too small to characterize but
likely consistent with a cyst.

[**2168-3-9**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal while the left ventricular cavity is
severely dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed, estimated EF is 20%. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the ascending aorta. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection is seen. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Only the
non-coronary cusp appears to be mobile. There is severe aortic
stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is decreased length
