History of Present Illness:
83yoM with h/o RCC s/p nephrectomy [**2085**] (with dural infiltration
s/p decompression laminectomy at C2-3; s/p upper C-spine
irradiation), CAD s/p MI, CRI baseline Cr 1.2-1.6, AAA s/p EVAR
[**7-/2111**], and recent R hip replacement.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital6 **] after a fall and had a R
total hip replacement on [**6-17**]. Per family, was in their ICU
for "breathing not well and low oxygen level" but was not
intubated. He was treated with IV ABx for PNA but details
unknown. He was given 6u PRBC's for post-op bleeding. He had
some "fibrillation" which the family was told was normal
post-op. Called out to Cards floor. Spent total 10d in the
hospital, d/c [**6-28**] to [**Hospital1 599**] [**Location (un) 55**] rehab.

In the rehab, was given Lasix for volume overload and Oxycodone
for pain control; both of which the pt's family feel were given
but not monitored much. Overall, he was doing well, working with
PT, and improving. Then, he had a fall 3d prior to arrival onto
his L hip (contralateral to operation), for which he went to his
Orthopedist 2d prior and the family states had X-rays and
everything was called as OK.

He was found to be lethargic at the nursing home on day of
admission, and per family he is more confused, very weak, and
not acting himself. Medics noted him to be moving all
extremities, without focal weakness and gave him 250 cc NS en
route. The family denies any f/c/sweats, n/v/abd
pain/diarrhea/constipation, CP, palpitations, SOB, urinary sxs,
CVA sxs, tingling/numbness.

In the ED initial VS: 98.5  103  90/49  18  92%. He had a CT
head which showed no acute hemorrhage but with small hypodensity
in R putamen new from [**2108**], and possibly small interval lacunar
infarct. He was guaic negative. CXR's had to be done a couple
times due to poor imaging, but eventually showed opacity at lung
bases, L>R called as PNA vs atelectasis.

He was febrile in the ED at 2pm to 102, so got 1g of Tylenol.
His systolics were 80-90's through the ED so given 2L IVF's with
improvement to 110; but then dropped to 70's and so got 3rd and
4th L's of NS and RIJ placed, started on Levophed, on small dose
before transfer 0.03 mcg/kg/min with improvement in SBP to 120's
by transfer to MICU. Total in ED = 5L NS, also got Zosyn IV, 1g
IV Vancomycin. VS before admission: 102.2, 78, 120/77, 22, 95%
3L ROS as above. Otherwise, negative all other systems per
family.


Past Medical History:
- RCC s/p nephrectomy [**2085**] with dural infiltration s/p
decompression laminectomy at C2-3 in [**10/2107**]; s/p upper cervical
spine irradiation completed in [**11/2107**] -> being followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**]
- CAD s/p MI ~20 yrs ago and not currently active, family denies
CABG or caths
- CRI, with baseline Cr 1.2-1.6
- Complex infrarenal aortic aneurysm, s/p EVAR in [**7-/2111**]
- Left hip dhs [**4-/2106**], complicated by failure of fixation,
converted to a left bipolar arthroplasty on [**5-/2106**], then
revision arthroplasty of the left hip and removal of a left
femur blade plate [**9-14**]
- R hip surgery in [**6-/2112**] for displaced R femoral neck fracture
- H/o falls and gait disturbance
- MRSA bacteremia [**2112-7-17**]


Social History:
Patient was living in [**Location (un) 55**] before the R hip replacement
with wife of 60 years, but was discharged to [**Location (un) 55**] [**Hospital1 599**]
after. 1 ppd x60 yrs and was smoking up until 4 wks ago, drinks

Brief Hospital Course:
1. MRSA BACTERMIA/SEPTIC SHOCK: In MICU, pt continued IVF's and
pressors were eventually able to be weaned. He was started on
Vanc/Zosyn/Levaquin intially but transitioned to vancomycin
alone after multiple blood cultures showed MRSA. Source of
infection was sought, but could not be definitevely determined.
Right hip aspiration yielded small amount of fluid which was not
infected by either gram stain or culture. MRI of left foot did
not show osteomyelitis. CT of abdomen revealed AAA graft in good
condition. Patient could not tolerate TEE to evaluate for
endocarditis. Patient was continued on vancomycin for planned 6
week treatment. Patient was discharged afebrile >72 hours with
blood cultures NGTD from both [**7-21**] and [**7-22**]. He is to follow up
in ID, orthopedic, and vascular clinic.

2. ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr 2.2 on admission was above
baseline 1.6-1.7. Improved to 1.7 by MICU callout with IVF's and
patient was discharged with Cr of 1.6. Diuresis was reinstated
upon return of baseline kidney function.

3. HEEL ULCER/CELLULITIS: This was evaluated by infectious
disease, podiatry, and vascular surgery. MRI was performed and
did not show evidence of osteomylelitis. It is not felt that
this was the cause of his bacteremia. Arterial duplex showed
evidence of PVD and vascular surgery felt that he may benefit
from revascularization. Angiography has been scheduled for a
week after discharge, but it remains unclear if the patient and
family want to pursue this.

4. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation with RVR on [**7-20**]. He responed well to his oral
metoprolol tartrate dose of 25mg. The following day he was
increased to 37.5 mg metoprolol tartrate [**Hospital1 **] and his rate
remained well controlled. He spontaneously reverted back to NSR
on [**7-25**] per telemetry. He was discharged on metoprolol succinate
100 daily and amiodarone 200 daily. Prophylaxis was originally
[**Date Range **] 325 daily. Coumadin 2.5 mg daily was started prior to
discharge. He is to follow up with his cardiologist.

5. ANEMIA OF INFLAMMATION: His Hct on admission was 25-30, but
drifted down during his stay. This is likely due to frequent
phlebotomy and poor production due to inflammation and CKD. He
was offered transfusion but
