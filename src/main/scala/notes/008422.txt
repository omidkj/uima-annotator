TEE [**2188-10-16**]:Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with normal left
ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at
time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. Biventricular function is unchanged. Mitral
regurgitation is unchanged. Aortic stenosis is unchanged. The
aorta is intact post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2188-10-16**] Ms. [**Known lastname 90871**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] coronary artery bypass grafting
times four performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  Please see the
operative note for details.  She tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit. She was extubated and did well
initially. Beta blockade was resumed and she was diuresed
towards her preoperative weight.

Her atrial fibrillation was somewhat difficult to control from a
rate standpoint.
Coumadin was given for the fibrillation.  On [**10-19**] she acutely
became cyanotic, hypotensive and lethargic.  She was brought
emergently to the ICU, intubated, a Swan Ganz catheter placed,
arterial monitoring begun as well. her initial BP was in the
60's with a cardiac index of 0.6.  Epinephrine, Milrinone and
Neo Synephrine were begun with improvement of all parameters
over an hour or so.  The index rose to >2 and pressors were
weaned.  She became anuric despite adequate BP,CI and correction
of her acidosis.  Her legs were severely mottled, but the left
failed to resolve and was pulseless.

She was taken to the Operating Room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
thrombectomy and angioplasty of the left common femoral artery.
She remained anuric and CVVH was begun. HD was susequently
tolerated and she was transitioned to this.  She awoke,
seemingly intact after the initial insult. She also had a
significant rise in her liver enzymes. She developed
thrombocytopenia and ultimately was HIT assay
negative.Argatroban was changed back to heparin. The platelet
count continued to improve slowly. She had some rectal bleeding
which resolved. Tube feeds were started.  GNR bacteremia was
treated with meropenem.
The patient was extubated and seemed to be progressing toward
discharge to rehabilitation. On POD22 the patient became
increasingly lethargic, see lost the pulse in her right leg and
was becoming increasingly acidotic. After a discussion with both
sons it was decided not to pursue any further agressive therapy,
she was made comfort measures only and passed away a short time
later.
