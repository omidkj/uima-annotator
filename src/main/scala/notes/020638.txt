Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32913**] is an 80 yo M with h/o recent ex lap with repair of
bile leak/duodenal enterotomy now with PEG tube and several
percutaneous biliary drains who presented from rehab with
tachypnea and respiratory distress.  Before arrival, EMS placed
him on BiPAP.

According to the rehab note, patient was getting chest therapy
at nursing home, and during this he became acutely short of
breath.  Also, he had altered mental status today worse than
baseline.

In the ED, he continued to be tachypneic but was unable to
answer further history questions.  His ABG showed respiratory
acidosis so he was intubated.  After intubation, he became
hypotensive with pressures nadiring at 67/37.  He was started on
norepinephrine for this hypotension and right IJ CVL was placed.
 Because of concern for sepsis, he underwent CT C/A/P which
showed left lower lobe collapse and no acute intra-abdominal
process.  His vital signs prior to transfer were 119 129/68 22
100%, CMV fi02 100%, Vt 460, RR 22, PEEP 5.

On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and sedated.  He does
not grimace to abdominal exam.  He was suctioned for large
amounts of mucus.

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2146-10-9**] 9:53 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, with necrotic consolidation
of the left lower lobe, and fluid versus soft tissue attenuation
of the left lower lobe bronchus.  This may represent mucus
plugging, or an obstructive lesion.  There is marked mediastinal
lymph node enlargement in all visualized stations.
2.  Small bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions.
3.  Calcified pleural plaques reflect prior asbestos exposure.

4.  Multiple abdominal drains, with no residual fluid collection
or acute
intra-abdominal pathology noted.

[**2146-10-15**] Change of drains
IMPRESSION:
Successful exchange and repositioning of a 10 French PTBD,
internal/external [**Month/Day/Year 19843**].

[**2146-10-16**] Chest X-ray:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Left subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube remain in
satisfactory
position.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contour is difficult
to assess
given patient rotation on the current examination.  There
continues to be
bilateral patchy airspace opacities with a more confluent
opacity at the left base, which may reflect multifocal
pneumonia.  An element of superimposed edema cannot be entirely
excluded as the pulmonary vasculature appears somewhat
indistinct.  There is a layering left effusion and a smaller
right effusion.  No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo M with recent ex lap with repair of bile leak/enterotomy
and placement of PTCB and PEG tube who presented from rehab with
hypercarbic respiratory failure and altered mental status.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure/septic shock: CT compatible
with necrotizing pneumonia, enterobacter growing from the sputum
as well as MRSA.  Due to witnessed aspiration event at rehab.
Low compliance/high resistance on the vent. Started on
vanc/zosyn for HCAP coverage now switched to vanc/cefepime and
transiently on pressors.  Pt underwent tracheostomy on [**10-14**].
Patient will go out on ID recommendations vanco for 21 days and
cefepime for a total of 8 days. The patient should have weekly
Chem7, vancomycin troughs, CBC, LFTs.
.
# Hypernatremia: Given free water replacement with D5W and
corrected quickly.
.
# Eosinophilia:  Was up to 5.3% of 6.8 wbc. Question remained as
to if this is medication-related due to zosyn, so this was
exchanged for cefepime on [**10-15**].
.
# Recent bile leak s/p surgery: PTBD (percutaneous biliary [**Month/Year (2) 19843**]
and JP [**Month/Year (2) 19843**] also in place) replaced by IR [**2146-10-15**] with
improvement in alkaline phosphotase today. Surgery team
continued to follow with no additional recommendations.

# CKD:  His admission Cr is 1.3 which is at his recent baseline
1.4

# Nutrition: Continued on TPN, as tube feeds not viable at this
time given aspiration occurred shortly after tubefeed
initiation.
