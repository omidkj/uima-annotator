Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempted VT tract ablation
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

History of Present Illness:
68M with h/o CAD (prior MIs, CABG, CHF), COPD on baseline O2,
CRI, DM, IACD placed for afib/VT in [**2-14**], presents for VT storm
with multiple ICD firings.
.
Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for ICD firing on
[**1-15**], discharged [**1-17**] after restarting amiodarone. Pacer was
interogated and showed afib.
.
After discharge pt was repeatedly shocked at home, on the way to
the ED and in the ED for VT. He reports no SOB, palpitations,
fevers/chills or CP but feels chest heaviness, heat wave, and
clammy prior to firings. Pt reports many waves of heat, only
some (about a dozen) resulting in shock. On arrival pt afebrile,
A-paced at 70, with BP 120/60s. Pt was ruled out for MI with CEs
neg x 2, Cr at baseline at 1.7. Dig level was checked after dose
and was 1.9. Pt was bolused and started on amio gtt and most
recent VT and shock was at 3am on [**2191-1-20**]. He also received IV
ativan, and 5mg IV dilaudid.
.
ROS: Currently pt denies SOB, CP, palpitations, abd pain, back
pain.

[**2191-1-21**] CCATH: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery
disease. 2. Patent LIMA-LAD. 3. Successful PCI of the LCX/OM
with drug-eluting stent.

[**2191-1-22**] CXR: Asymmetric CHF. An underlying infectious infiltrate
in the right lower lung cannot be excluded.

[**2191-1-26**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
inferolateral and inferior akinesis. Views are suboptimal so
regional wall motion could not be fully assessed. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Mitral regurgitation is not fully
visualized. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2191-1-27**] CT chest: 1. Moderate, mostly loculated, right pleural
effusion and small, dependent freely layering left pleural
effusion. 2. Dense opacity at right lung base adjacent to
pleural effusion likely
represents atelectasis and less likely focal infection. 3.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities with septal thickening and
bronchial wall
thickening likely represent hydrostatic edema, but viral
pneumonia may
produce a similar pattern. 4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy with
the largest lymph node conglomerate located subcarinally.
Although potentially related to hydrostatic edema or infection,
given the large size of the subcarinal lymph nodes, there is
concern for malignancy. Followup CT in 6 weeks after treatment
of the patients acute conditoin is recommended. 5. Two nodular
foci in the right upper lobe may represent focal areas of
infection and less likely malignant lung nodules. These may also
be reassessed at the follow up CT scan. 6. Small amoung of
ascites is noted. Hypodense lesion in the upper pole of the left
kidney likely represents a cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
68M with MMP presents with VT storm and ICD firing, transferred
from outside hospital for EP ablation.
.
# Ventricular Tachycardia:
Patient presented from outside hospital with VT storm, initially
thought to be of ischemic etiology due to scar tissue. TSH and
digoxin level were within normal limits.  Patient had been
loaded on amiodarone at outside hospital and was continued on
amiodarone drip at 0.5mg/hr and beta blocker on presentation to
[**Hospital1 18**]. On the night of admission, patient had frequent runs of
NSVT, longest 15 beats, which started while he was sleeping.
While awake, patient reported feeling a sensation of "warmth"
during some of these runs of NSVT. He was started on low dose
metoprolol (both patient and daughter do not recall reason for
listed atenolol allergy) and amiodarone drip dose was increased
to 1mg/hr, after which frequency of NSVT runs decreased quickly.
During attempted EP ablation of VT tract the next morning,
Electrophysiology team was able to map out patient's left
ventricle and felt that VT was coming from right ventricle.
Patient reported having chest pain during EP procedure, so the
procedure was cut short, and patient was sent for Cardiac
Catheterization with the presumption that his VT may have been
of ischemic etiology. The patient had a PCI of the LCX/OM with
drug-eluting stent, however, felt that this wasn't in the right
location to be causing his VT. The patient had no further runs
of VT and no furt
