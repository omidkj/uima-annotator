Micro:
[**11-11**]: blood cx 1/4 bottles +E coli
[**11-12**]: blood cx negative
[**11-14**]: urine cx negative

Imaging:
CXR [**11-11**]: No definite evidence for an acute cardiopulmonary
process, however, if symptoms persist, a dedicated PA and
lateral chest radiograph should be obtained.

CT abd/pelv [**11-12**]:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Right basal lung consolidation.
3. Moderate ascites.

CXR [**11-12**]: Bilateral lower lobe opacities, possibly representing
aspiration or atelectasis. Bilateral effusions are likely.

CXR [**11-13**]: Basal densities developing over the last two days and
are suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions. Complete PA and
lateral chest view is recommended for further confirmation of
the somewhat subtle findings. A previous abdominal chest CT of
[**2149-11-12**], included images of the basal portions of the
lungs disclosed bilateral pleural effusions as well as some
atelectasis in the dependent portion of the posterior segments.
This finding is consistent with findings observed on the single
portable chest view, which however, cannot present same detail
as the CT examination.

CXR [**11-14**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased
since [**11-13**]. Minimal interstitial edema persists along
with left lobe atelectasis. No findings to suggest pneumonia. A
paucity vessels in the upper lobes suggest emphysema. Heart size
is normal and midline. No pneumothorax.

RLE LENI [**11-15**] 6am: This examination had suboptimal images of
the superficial femoral vein and was repeated.
RLE LENI [**11-15**] 12pm: No evidence of DVT in the right lower
extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 56yo man with h/o poorly controlled DM admitted with
DKA secondary to medication non-adherence in the setting of
depression.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. DKA - The patient was started on an insulin drip per standard
protocol for ~30 hours. His anion gap closed, and he was started
on NPH at 15u [**Hospital1 **] given his poor PO intake (on 25u [**Hospital1 **] at home).
After adjustment during his hospital stay, he was discharged on
25 units NPH qam and 18 units NPH qhs.

2. Leukocytosis - The patient presented with a WBC of 24. This
was initially thought to be a stress reaction similar to that
evidenced in a prior admission, but after one blood culture grew
E coli he was started on levofloxacin and flagyl. The remainder
of the blood cultures were positive, including the other 3 from
that day, and he had no source of infection, nor was he febrile.
As such, the levofloxacin was continued only for a 7 day course
for possible pneumonia (CXR with unclear basal opacities on
initial read). Flagyl was discontinued given the culture results
of E coli. His WBC trended down and was normal at discharge.

3. ARF - He was admitted with a Cr of 3.2, a similar elevation
to his last admission for DKA. This was most likely secondary to
dehydration from the hyperglycemia. He was aggressively hydrated
with IVF and his Cr was 0.7 on discharge.

4. Hyperkalemia - On admission, he had peaked T waves on ECG and
a K of 8.3. His hyperglycemia was treated with IVF and insulin,
and he received calcium for the hyperkalemia. This resolved and
was within normal limits once his anion gap closed.

5. CV - He had a h/o cardiomyopathy, but not CAD. He had no
evidence of active ischemia during this admission. He was
discharged on home regimen of ASA and lisinopril. Outpatient
echo was recommended to re-assess his LVEF.

6. H/o EtOH - The patient denied recent EtOH use. He had no
evidence of withdrawal.

7. Socioeconomic issues - The social worker was extensively
involved in this hospitalization. At discharge, Pharmacare had
been contact[**Name (NI) **] to waive the copay for his prescriptions and he
was notified of this. He was given information about the
resources available to him for aid and instructed on how to
contact the agencies involved.

8. Code status - full.

9. depression- a major contributor to his original presentation.
Pt requested an inpatient psychiatric consultation, which was
obtained.
