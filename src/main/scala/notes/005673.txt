Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old male found down at bottom of a stair way, unsure
length of time down, ETOH of 198 at OSH.  Family feels he fell
going upstairs.  Pt went to [**Hospital 68295**] [**Hospital **] Hospital on arrival
orientated X2 moving all extremities was found to have Left
frontal bleed and SAH blood.  He was intubated and sedated and
medflighted here.

On his MRI he had:
1. Similar appearance of 2 large acute intraparenchymal
hemorrhages in left frontal and left cerebellar hemispheres,
with punctate right small occpital hemorrhage.
2. Slightly larger, likely right-sided subdural hygroma along
the right frontal convexity surface of the brain.
3. Small bilateral posterior subdural hematomas.
4. Multiple areas of T2 hyperintensity in the cerebral white
matter, consistent with chronic small vessel infarcts.
5. Occipital bone fracture.

The patient had an NGT placed and began receiving tube feedings
on [**2100-11-17**].
He had fevers up to 101.5 on [**2100-11-18**], had blood cultures that
showed gram + cocci in [**2-10**] bottles, and was started on
vancomycin.

On [**2100-11-19**] he was started on cipro and flagyl per ID
recommendation for possible aspiration pneumonia. He had an echo
which showed no masses or vegetation with an EF of 60%.

On [**2100-11-22**] the patient received a tracheostomy and a PEG tube.
His chest CT showed evolving aspiration pneumonia. The
vancomycin was changed to nafcillin per ID fellow.
His antibiotics were changed several times as his imaging and
blood cultures continued to be followed.

On [**2100-11-23**] the patient was taken off the vent and switched to
trach mask.

On [**2100-11-26**] he had a bronchoscopy and BAL cultures showed
------------no microorganisms. Then he was transferred to the
