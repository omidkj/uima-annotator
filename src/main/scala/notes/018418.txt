History of Present Illness:
38 y/o F with hx. ETOH cirrhosis, mult osh admissions for
withdrawals and DTs (continues to drink 2 pints of Vodka daily)
and mult osh dicharges 'ama' was found by police 'down' and
intoxicated with multiple bruises.  Brought to [**Hospital1 3793**], where she was noted to have an etoh level of 389 (at
1300h [**9-19**]), a bp of 75/44 (up to 124 sbp s/p 3 litres NS), LUL
infiltrate and ? mediastinal pathology; Head CT: showing no
acute pathology, brain atrophy, bilateral maxillary air fluid
levels.

Stated that she had not been eating or drinking for weeks
(except vodka).  The hospitalist there saw her, felt that she
needed ERCP (due to a hypoechoic mass of the pancreas seen under
his care there one month previously for a similar admission).
They gave her CTX/Azithro, lactulose, 10 of KCl IV, and
transferred her here "for ERCP".

On arrival at our ED, she was noted to be diffusely rhonchorous,
satting in the 80's, adamantly refusing foley, rectal exam.  had
"coffee ground emesis" on her shirt, but denied vomiting.  She
had mult bruises apparent.  She was put on a NRB and was
persistently tachy to the 130's (133 94/65  18  94% NRB).  She
then had a melanotic stool per the ED (approx 200 cc, guaiac
pos), and protonix was started.  She was intubated.  An OGT was
placed.  GI was called per the ED resident, and suggestion was
made to call the Liver team.  Liver recommended Octreotide gtt,
and this was started.  She was given 4 mg ativan and ptopofol
was up titrated for agitation/tremulousness to 40 mcg/kg/min and
she was sent to CT for head and torso scans en route to the
TSICU under the MICU Green service.

Notable initial labs in our ED:
K:3.0
Lactate:4.4

Pertinent Labs/Studies:
.
Imaging:
[**2174-9-19**]: CT Head
1.  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is identified.
2.  There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci, which is
slightly unusual in a patient of this age, and is consistent
with cerebral atrophy.
3.  Fluid within the sphenoid sinus is likely related to
patient's intubation.
.
[**2174-9-19**]: CT C/A/P
1.  Endotracheal tube tip within the right bronchus intermedius
with
associated bilateral upper lobe atelectasis.  This was discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of the examination.
2. Enlarged, fatty liver consistent with the patient's given
history of liver disease.
.
[**2174-9-21**]: Abdominal US - IMPRESSION:  No evidence of ascites.
.
[**2174-9-26**]: Echocardiogram (TTE)
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2174-9-29**]: CT C/A/P
1.  Patent mesenteric vasculature.  No significant bleeding
source identified.
2.  Patchy opacities, most prominently involving the upper
lobes.  Given the recent bilateral upper lobe collapse, this
most likely represents reexpansion edema.
3.  Markedly enlarged fatty attenuation liver.
4.  Severe anasarca.
.
[**2174-9-29**]: CT Sinus - IMPRESSION:  Fluid within the sphenoid and
ethmoid sinuses, which may be secondary to intubation.  Mild
sinus mucosal thickening.
.
[**2174-10-9**]: CT A/P -
1. Possible thickening in the upper cecum and ascending colon.
This
appearance is difficult to evaluate due to underdistension, but
there is
apparent stratification of the wall which is also suspicious for
colitis.
2. Increased ascites since the prior study. This may be due to
an edematous state, but can also be seen in infectious colitis.
3. Improved upper lobe opacities in the lungs.
4. Left lower lobe collapse. This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3037**]
at 11 pm on the same day.
5. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
.
[**2174-10-10**]: Portable CXR
FINDINGS:  Upright radiograph of the chest.  Endotracheal tube
is identified with its tip approximately 4.5 cm from the carina.
 Left-sided internal jugular line is seen with its tip unchanged
in position and overlying the upper to mid SVC.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Left retrocardiac
density representing atelectasis Vs. airspace disease appears
stable.  Some improvement in the right basilar atelectasis is
noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
Nasogastric tube is identified with its proximal side port below
the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION:  Stable left retrocardiac density representing
atelectasis Vs.
airspace disease.
