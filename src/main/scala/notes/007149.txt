Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral lower extremity DVTs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colectomy with Ileostomy


History of Present Illness:
66 year-old man with history of ulcerative colitis, recently
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with lower GI bleed (HCT 15,
transfused 6 units PRBC) as well as bilateral DVT s/p IVC filter
3 weeks ago. Patient during the past week has been having
worsening bilateral lower extremity edema, some ecchymosis and
petechiae in left foot > right foot, and starting today with
excruciating pain LLE < RLE, coldness, weakness and decreased
sensation of the dorsum of his L foot. Patient was initially
treated with anticoagulation at the outside hospital when his
DVT was first diagnosed, but given his GI bleed this was stopped
and his coumadin was resumed for the past couple of days. His
last bowel movement was today and it was melena. CT of bilateral
lower extremities on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] showed extensive DVTs
beginning at the level of IVC down into bilateral calves, and
the patient was bolused 4000 units Heparin in the ED and
transferred to the floor on a heparin gtt.

Past Medical History:
Ulcerative colitis (last colonoscopy [**2169-12-26**]: sigmoid with
active chronic colitis without granulomas, no evidence of
ischemic colitis)
Lower GI bleed (BRBPR [**2169-12-24**] - [**2170-1-6**], HCT 15, transfused
6 units PRBC, C. diff negative, colonoscopy with severe
ulceration from anus to 70 cm / splenic flexure, negative H.
pylori, IV solumedrol and asacol 1200 mg TID, EGD mild
gastritis, Flagyl / Levaquin initially but discontinued when
stool cultures negative for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter,
and E. coli. Flex [**Year (4 digits) 65**] [**2170-1-3**] showed severe ulcerative colitis,
contraindicated to anticoagulate, therefore IVC filter was
placed).

Past Surgical History:
- Tonsillectomy
- IVC filter [**12/2169**] (initially presented with LLE DVT, had IVC
filter placed, then re-presented with RLE DVT: not candidate for
tPA or thrombectomy by [**Hospital1 2177**] vascular surgery, [**2170-1-11**] CT chest
with RUL/RLL and LUL segmental PE's--main pulm a 2.5 cm--fragmin
and coumadin initiated)

Social History:
Single, works in a grocery store and lives with his brother. [**Name (NI) **]
a history of drinking half to a full pint 5 days per week, but
has not had a drink for almost two months. Smokes 1.5 packs per
day since the age of 13. Denies illicit drug use.

Family History:
Does not know his father's medical history. Mother died of
breast cancer in her 60s and did not have known abnormal
clotting. His brother has problems with pancreatitis.

Pertinent Results:
COLON PATHOLOGY [**2170-2-3**]:
1. Terminal ileum, colon and appendix, ileo-colectomy (A-M):
- Chronic moderately-to-severely active colitis with
pseudopolyps and ulcerations, focally involving submucosa and
superficial muscularis propria.
- Active disease present at both resection margins.
- Appendix, within normal limits.
- Three lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/3).
- No granulomata or dysplasia identified.
2. Colon, "true distal margin" resection (N-P):
- Chronic severely active colitis with deep ulceration;
involving the entire segment.
- No granulomata or dysplasia identified.
3. Terminal ileum, resection (Q-S): Segment of small intestine,
within normal limits.

CYTOLOGY, left pleural fluid [**2170-2-5**]:
ATYPICAL.
  - Rare atypical epithelioid cells, favor reactive mesothelial
  cells.
  - Background mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and neutrophils.

CELL BLOCK, left pleural fluid [**2170-2-6**]:
Atypical; atypical epithelioid cells favor reactive mesothelial
cells. By immunohistochemistry, cytokeratin cocktail (keratin
AE1/AE3, Cam 5.2), calretinin, and WT-1 highlight mesothelial
cells. CD15 highlights background inflammatory cells. No
immunoreactivity is seen for B72.3, [**Last Name (un) **]-31, or CEA (absorbed).

CT BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITIES [**2170-1-22**]: Extensive deep venous
thrombosis beginning at the level of the IVC filter extending
inferiorly. On the right, thrombus is seen throughout the lower
extremity to the calf veins. On the left, thrombus extends
through the common iliac vein after which there is
reconstitution with intermittent non-occlusive thrombus in the
common femoral an proximal superficial femoral vein. Occlusive
clot is again present within the popliteal vein extending into
the calf veins on the left.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**2170-2-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive subcutaneous mediastinal, peritoneal and
retroperitoneal areas. No definitive leak points identified,
though an intestinal source is most likely given large amount of
left upper abdominal gas and history ulcerative colitis flare.
2. Large, layering nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions responsible
for
atelectasis.
3. Two diaphragmatic pleural calcifications, not necessarily
asbestos-related.
4. 1.4 cm left adrenal nodule is statistically an adrenal
adenoma.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2170-2-2**]:
1. No evidence of an intraabdominal leak or extraluminal orally
administered contrast noted.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Unchanged pneumomediastinum and retroperitoneal air.
4. Large amount of subcutaneous fluid and edema likely related
to iatrogenic fluid overload.

ECG [**2170-2-8**]:
Sinus bradycardia with baseline artifact. Compared to the
previous tracing
probably no significant change.

CXR [**2170-2-11**]:
There is no evident pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.

Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There are low lung
volumes. Left
PICC tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Bibasilar
atelectases, larger on the right side, are stable. Calcified
granulomas in
the right upper lobe are again noted. Ill-defined rounded
opacity in the left upper lobe is persistent. When clinically
feasible CT is recommended for further evaluation.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)	Study Date of [**2170-2-14**]
IMPRESSION: Peristent near-complete occlusion of the deep
bilateral lower
extremity veins. Minimal flow in the right common femoral, deep
femoral, and greater saphenous veins and left greater saphenous
vein.

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2170-2-15**] IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative sequelae as described above, with a small
amount of residual free fluid and severe anasarca, though no
evidence of intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess.
2. Extensive severe deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral
femoral
vasculature, iliac vasculature in the lower portions of the IVC,
below an
infrarenal IVC filter. There is no evidence of more pr
