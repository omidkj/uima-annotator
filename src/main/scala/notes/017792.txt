RADIOLOGY:
[**2-26**]: RUQ U/S: No prior studies for comparisons. The study is
significantly limited by patient habitus. The hepatic parenchyma
is not well visualized. Multiple shadowing gallstones are
present. The gallbladder is not significantly distended.
Allowing for the technical limitations of the study, no wall
edema is appreciated. There is diffuse right upper quadrant
pain, but no focal son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign. Main portal vein is
patent with appropriate hepatopetal flow and wave form.

IMPRESSION: Very limited study. Cholelithiasis.

[**2-26**]: KUB: Films are not specifically labeled as upright or
supine. Gas and stool are seen throughout the colon. No
air-filled dilated loops of large or small bowel are identified.
Possible small scattered fluid levels, but no findings to
suggest obstruction. No obvious intraperitoneal air, although
subtle abnormalities would be difficult to exclude on these
films, due to patient body habitus and technical factors. There
is scattered vascular calcification, with a stent in the lower
aorta and proximal common iliac vessels. There is osteopenia and
degenerative change of the lumbar spine. Apparent non-acute rib
fracture involving the left tenth rib. In addition, there is
deformity of the left iliac crest, not fully evaluated, but most
suggestive of sequela of remote trauma.

IMPRESSION:  Bowel gas pattern within normal limits. No evidence
of obstruction. Stool noted.

[**2-27**]: CT ABD/PELVIS: There are ill-defined, focal opacities in
the visualized portion of the right middle lobe, with a
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance. This is a nonspecific finding and is
most likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology. There is
mild left base atelectasis. No pleural or pericardial effusions.
There is a nasogastric tube in place.

The stomach is distended, with gastric contents mixed with
contrast. There is a 5.5 x 2.7 cm duodenal diverticulum at the
third portion of the duodenum (sequence 2, image #35), as seen
on prior studies. There is stranding adjacent to the fourth
portion of the duodenum near the junction with proximal
(sequence 2, image #34). An ill-defined heterogeneous
hypoattenuating structure in the duodenal lumen most likely
represents intestinal contents. No abrupt narrowing is seen to
explain the gastric distension.

There are gallstones. The liver is unremarkable. No intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The pancreas, spleen
and adrenal glands are normal. There are multiple bilateral
renal cysts, the largest in the left kidney. Otherwise, the
kidneys are unremarkable, without hydronephrosis. No abdominal
lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

An endovascular AAA stent graft is again seen with a stable
endoleak present. There are extensive vascular calcifications,
including involving the celiac and SMA, however there are
secondary signs of bowel ischemia.

CT PELVIS: The urinary bladder is decompressed and contains a
Foley catheter. There are prostatic calcifications. The rectum
and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.

No suspicious osseous lesions.

Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in the delineation
of the above findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. Gastric distention without features to suggest a distal
obstruction.
2. Mild stranding involving the fourth portion of the duodenum
of uncertain significance. Clinical correlation recommended to
exclude possibility of duodenitis.
3. focal right middle lobe lung opacities consistent with
infectious or inflammatory process.
4. Endovascular stent graft within aortic aneurysm, with stable
endoleak.
5. Extensive vascular calcifications

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**] was admitted to the Vascular service complaining of
nausea and vomiting one day prior to a scheduled repair of his
Type 1 endoleak.  Overnight HD1, he had a few episodes of
emesis, and a large emesis on HD2.  A nasogastric tube was
placed and over the following 16 hours, 5600 cc of gastric
contents were evacuated.  He was maintained NPO with his
nasogastric tube to suction.  A total of 1600 cc was evacuated
from his stomach on HD3.  Gastroenterology was consulted, and a
plan was formulated to perform an upper endoscopy on HD4 in the
ICU, as he had prior complications with endoscopy.  He was
transferred to the TSICU on the evening of HD3.
  On HD4, he was intubated, and his heart rhythm converted to
rapid atrial fibrillation.  Cardiology was involved, and he was
stabilized with a diltiazem drip and an amiodarone drip.  The
upper endoscopy was performed, and demonstrated no lesions. The
diltiazem drip was discontinued.   His nasogastric tube was
removed, he was extubated, and he recovered well overnight with
an amiodarone drip in the TSICU.  On the morning of HD5, his
amiodarone drip completed, and per his cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 73**], his amiodarone drip was stopped, and there was no
need for a taper.  Mr. [**Known lastname 34858**] diet was advanced, and he
tolerated solid foods well.  He is to have close follow up with
Cardiology, Vascular Surgery, and his PCP.
