Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated. Trach and [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male with past medical history of
lung cancer status post resection, hypertension, DVT on
coumadin, and prostate disease who presented with respiratory
distress. He is intubated and unable to provide history, so
history is obtained from his family and medical records. Per the
chart, around 4:00 PM he was noted to be pale and have
increasing respiratory distress. An oxygen saturation was noted
to be 66%, with heart rate of 94, blood pressure 90/50,
respiratory rate of 22. 100% oxygen face mask was administered
with improvement in saturation to 75%. A finger stick at that
time was 183. EMS was called, and patient was to be brought to
[**Hospital3 **], where he receives most of his care. Due to his
respiratory distress, however, he was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, his vital signs were initially blood pressure 135/71,
heart rate of 90, and oxygen saturation of 88% on 15L NRB. He
was not responsive at the time. He was given rocoronim and
intubated due to inability to protect his airway and hypoxia. He
was also given 2 mg of narcan prior to intubation. He was given
vancomycin, zosyn, and started on propofol. His initial ABG just
after intubation was: 7.24, 88, 44, and shortly later was 7.32,
75, 250 on AC rate 12, PEEP 10. He was given 4 liters of IVFs.
His family arrived at the ED. Due to his unresponsiveness, a
head CT was completed, which was negative for an acute process
on preliminary read. A chest x-ray was also completed which
demonstrated right middle and lower lobe collapse versus
infiltrate.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was intubated, sedated, and not
responsive. His family was at the bedside. They provided
additional history that he had been living alone in an apartment
until relatively recently when he sustained a fall and was not
found until several days later. He was then admitted, and was
discovered to have a DVT, as well as a small fracture in his
leg. He was discharged to a rehabilitation/nursing facility,
where he was being assisted, with plan for possible eventual
return to his apartment. They report he has been somewhat sleepy
over the last few visits when they see him, and he spends a
significant amount of time in bed. They report he was never on
oxygen until his recent hospitalization. Prior to his
hospitalization he was fully independent.
.
Review of systems is otherwise negative as obtained from
family--no recent significant illness they were aware of.
Possible slight cough recently, no fevers or chills.

Social History:
Patient currently lives in a rehabilitation/nursing facility,
though was living in an apartment alone prior to this. He quit
smoking many years ago, and his family states he does not drink
alcohol or use any ilicit drugs to their knowledge. He walks
without any assistive devices.

CXR [**2102-2-17**]:
Comparison made with prior study from [**2102-2-17**]. ET tube
terminates 3 cm above the carina. The cardiac silhouette remains
unchanged in size and
appearance. Consolidation is again noted in both lungs, worse in
the bases
and in the apices. This is not appreciably changed. No
pneumothorax is
noted.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged pneumonia.
.
[**2102-2-3**]:
CTA of chest
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Moderate atherosclerotic calcification and plaque of the
aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
2. Focal parenchymal consolidation of the right lung, centered
at the right hilus, adjacent to the surgical bed. Scattered
airspace nodules in the right middle lobe are also consistent
with infection. However, underlying lesion in the surgical bed
cannot be ruled out, and followup to resolution is recommended
following appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
4. No PE or dissection.
.
CT abd without contrast [**2102-2-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Choledocholithiasis with numerous calcified stones within the
distal
common bile duct. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct
dilatation. ERCP
would be beneficial for removal.
2. Moderate left pleural effusion, trace right pleural effusion.

3. Rectus diastasis without ventral hernia.
4. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm 3 cm.
5. Left UPJ obstruction versus multiple parapelvic cysts.
Further evaluation may be obtained with ultrasound on a
nonurgent basis as indicated.
6. Soft tissue in the right hilar region in the post surgical
bed for lung
carcinoma may reflect standard post surgical change however
recurrence cannot be excluded on this non-contrast enhanced
study. Right pleural thickening could also be properly evaluated
if concern for recurrence exists.
.
EKG [**2102-2-17**]:
Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is
prolonged. Right axis deviation. Right bundle-branch block.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing the P-R interval is shorter.
.
CT head without contrast [**2102-2-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Soft tissue density over the left (greater than right)
occiput suggests
trauma, clinically correlate.
3. Air in the venous system, likely from phlebotomy.
4. Coiled orogastric tube seen in the pharynx.
.
Echo [**2102-2-22**]:
Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-2-3**], no
definite change.
