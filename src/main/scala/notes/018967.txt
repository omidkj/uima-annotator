Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 678**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for mgt of abdominal/pelvic hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.)Central Line Placement
2.)PICC line Placement
3.)Respiratory Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
69yo woman with PMH as below which includes CAD s/p MI/CABG,
A-fib on coumadin who presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital on
[**2128-2-13**] with fever, shortness of breath and cough.  She was
diagnosed with a LLL pneumonia and initially treated with
Ceftriaxone and Azithro.  Her respiratory status worsened, she
was transferred to their ICU and intubated for respiratory
failure.  Echocardiogram showed a normal EF and BNP was
equivocal making cardiogenic pulmonary edema less likely as a
cause for her resp failure.  She was continued on abx and given
stress dose steroids given her chronic Prednisone for RA.  Her
status improved until [**2128-2-22**] when she became acutely
hypotensive and was noted to have a drop in hematocrit from 34
to 25 with new abdominal distention.  CT revealed a large
abdominal/pelvic mass thought to be a large hematoma and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgt.  Of note, her INR was
supratherapeutic on arrival to [**Location (un) **] and was corrected with
FFP.  She had been restarted on Heparin after her INR on [**2-17**]
was 1.2.
      ICU course was remarkable for episodes of hypertension
requiring labetalol and nitroglycerin gtts. Surgery had been
consulted for the hematoma and recommended only monitoring. In
the ICU the patient was successfully extubated on [**2-25**] and
continued on bronchodilators. She had been started on
ceftriaxone/Vancomycin and changed to Ceftazidime for concerns
of VAP. Blood cultures from [**2-26**] were [**2-3**] positive for VRE from
an arterial line. This culture also grew 2 different isolates of
coag negative staph. Antibiotics were altered on [**3-2**] from Vanco
to linezolid given the continued fevers and antibiotic
resistance profile of the enterococcus. The patient's mental
status waxed and waned in the ICU prompting a head CT that was
negative for bleed on [**2-26**]. Her mental status mildly improved
upon transfer to the medical floor. The ICU team was called to
evaluate the patient today secondary to worsening mental status
and hypercarbic respiratory failure. ABG was 7.37/64/144 on 50%
facemask. There had been concern for possible CHF as the cause
of her declining respiratory status on the floor and was
diuresed with 20mg iv furosemide x 2 on [**3-2**] and 20mg iv
furosemide x 1 on [**3-1**]. Her urine output was reported to be
500cc to the last dose of furosemide on [**3-2**].
