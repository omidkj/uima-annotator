History of Present Illness:
79 F with multiple sclerosis, complicated by neurogenic bladder,
CAD s/p MI, PVD, long-term care resident of [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 16824**]. Recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 336**] 1 week ago for
musculocutaneous flap for stage 4 right ischial pressure ulcer.
.
Was in USOH until this past Saturday when felt chest congestion.
Received nebs with improvement in symptoms. Then, again had an
episode of chest congestion while receiving IV Zosyn on day of
admit. VS T 97.8, BP 120/72, HR 65, RR 20, O2 sat 93% on 3L O2.
.
She otherwise denied any chest discomfort, palpitations, nausea,
emesis, diaphoresis, lightheadedness. She had chest pressure at
the time of her MI in [**2116**]. She did have similar symptoms in [**Month (only) **]
of this year, and was admitted, but was ruled out by cardiac
biomarkers, and has not had similar symptoms since.
.
Referred by [**Hospital1 18**] ED where noted to be tachycardic to 130s with
up to 3mm ST depressions v2-v4. Received ASA 325, SL NTG,
metoprolol 5 mg IV with improvement in rate to 80s, BP down to
90s systolic. CTA peformed which did not show PE, but was
consistent with failure. Started on BiPAP, as was felt not to
tolerate lasix due to hypotension.

Chest X-ray [**10-24**]
Since the prior study there has been improved aeration of the
right paracentral regions suggesting improved CHF. Residual
features persist. There is some left basilar atelectasis. No new
focal consolidations and no increased distention of the
pulmonary vasculature. Heart size is within normal limits.
.
Cardiology Report C.CATH Study Date of [**2122-10-22**]
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated an LMCA with 40% distal stenosis. The LAD was
calcified with 40% midvessel lesion; the diagonal had a 40%
lesion. The LCX had a mid 50% lesion and supplied collaterals to
the right. The RCA had a 90% ostial lesion and there was diffuse
60-70% restenosis through the entire course of the RCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial pressures.
3. Distal aortography was performed to ensure that
initial-access guidewire passage did not cause trauma. There was
no sign of perforation or dye extravasation. The common femoral
artery had 50% stenosis.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial rca with a 3.0x18
cypher and a 3.0x8 cypher. Successful PTCA and stenting of the
mid-distal RCA with overlapping 3.0x33 and 2.5x28mm Cypher
stents. Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis in the
stented areas, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI
3 flow.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of RCA.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2122-10-20**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe inferior wall hypokinesis and mild inferolateral wall
hypokinesis. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate
([**12-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2118-2-7**], the wall motion abnormality is new and consistent
with single vessel CAD. The mitral regurgitation is also new.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON Study Date of [**2122-10-19**] 1:06 AM
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2.  Small-to-moderate bilateral simple layering pleural
effusions with
peribronchovascular opacities and septal thickening, most
suggestive of  alveolar and interstitial pulmonary edema.
Appropriate treatment and repeat
radiographs is recommended to assess for resolution and exclude
infectious
etiology.
3.  Dense calcifications within the left and right coronary
circulation,
intrathoracic aorta, and aortic root.  Mild LVH and left atrial
enlargement.
4.  Stable small hypoattenuating right thyroid lesion is likely
a benign
nodule and could be further evaluated with a dedicated
ultrasound on a
nonemergent basis if clinically indicated.
5.  Centrilobular emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
Patient is 79 F with multiple sclerosis, admitted with pulmonary
edema and hypotension, found to have NSTEMI.
.
# NSTEMI and likely resultant CHF/hypotension:
NSTEMI with enzyme bump with failure both clinically and by
radiographic studies. Last assessment of EF by nuclear imaging
in [**2120-7-29**] was nl, though a TTE in [**2117**] did suggest diastolic
dysfunction. Echo on [**2122-10-20**] showed new diastolic dysfunction
with inferior and lateral hypokinesis, and mitral regurgitation.
 Gave aspirin, statin, Plavix and 48 hours of heparin drip.
Initially did not tolerate small doses of Beta blockers due to
hypotension, but did tolerate small dose of Ace-I. Was taken to
cath [**10-22**] where a diffusely diseased RCA was intervened on
w/multiple drug-eluting stents. Her CHF was felt to be
exacerbated by acute diastolic dysfunction in the setting of an
NSTEMI.  Was transferred to the floor for continued diuresis,
which she tolerated well, remaining hemodynamically stable x 48
hours.  Also tolerated low dose Metoprolol of 12.5 mg daily
(previously on 25 mg poi [**Hospital1 **] on admit).  Upon discharge she was
stable and tolerating low dose BB, ACE-I, ASA, statin and
Plavix.  Should have LFTs checked by primary physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-3**]
weeks to monitor for elevation given increased statin.
.
#Sacral Decubitus: No fevers at this time, mild leukocytosis on
admit that resolved.
