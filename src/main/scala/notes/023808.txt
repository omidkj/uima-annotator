Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Blood Loss Anemia, GI Bleed, Gastric Ulcers, Ventilator
Associated Pneumonia, Acute Systolic CHF, Diarhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Esophageal Gastroduodenoscpy

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old Female with anemia, Systolic CHF, Atrial
fibrillation previously on coumadin, erosive gastritis, PVD with
recent fall on [**2123-12-14**] with hip fracture s/p left total hip
replacement placed on aspirin/lovenox, who presents with
hematemesis and massive GI bleed. Patient by report developed 24
hours of hematemesis and melena, along with syncope in the
setting of the bleeding. At presentation to the outside hospital
ED, her Hematocrit was 16 from 27 the day prior and NG lavage
was positive, but she was not given blood because she was a
difficult crossmatch.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she arrived with SBP in the 50s. Patient was
guaiac positive, NGT putting out blood and small amount of
clots. She received a PPI drip, 4 units PRBCs transfusion, 1
unit FFP (INR 1.3 at OSH, 1.6 here) and 1 bag of platelets with
improvement in her pressures to SBPs 110s. However, she again
became hypotensive and was given a fifth unit of blood.
Initially she was 100% on NRB was and 96% on RA, but she became
markedly hypoxic after the blood transfusions.  Given her need
for an endoscopic procedure, her elderly age and frail status,
her LVEF of 30% with demand ischemia on EKG, she was
intubated in the ED.

A surgical consult was obtained and recommended following GI/EGD
results along with serial hematocrits.  GI was consulted and
recommended EGD. The patient was sent to the MICU intubated and
sedated. An EGD was performed with results below, which were
injected with epinepharine.

On [**12-26**] she was given one dose of IV lasix and extubated,
however shortly thereafter she developed low grade fever, cough
productive of brown sputum and an infiltrate on chest xray, so
was diagnosed with hospital acquired pneumonia. She was also
noted in florid CHF with a BNP of 45,000. Additional IV diuresis
was performed with improvement. She was transferred to the floor
for further management.

Of note in the MICU, a meeting with the family changed her code
status to DNR/DNI.

On the floor her CHF was treated with continued lasix.
