Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute kidney injury

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
balloon valvuloplasty


History of Present Illness:
75 YOM with h/o severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8), sCHF (EF of 20-25% on
[**2108-2-14**]) and regular patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] presenting
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after routine labs showed [**Last Name (un) **]. He was last
hospitalized here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**1-/2107**] for NSTEMI, found to have
3VD and underwent CABG. Intraoperative assesment of his aorta
revealed extensive calcification and he was felt to be extremely
hig risk for open AVR. His AS has been managed medically since.
2 weeks ago he was admitted to OSH with SOB and found to be in
CHF exacerbation. He was diuresed and on discharge his torsemide
was increased to 40mg QD 2 weeks ago. He was seen yesterday in
Dr.[**Name (NI) 12389**] office, where they agreed to pursue TAVI and a
follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was planned. He underwent
routine Lab check at that time which showed [**Last Name (un) **]. (Cr 7 base line
1.9) with hyperkalemia. He was telephoned this afternoon and
sent to the ED. He is reportedly asyptomatic but had tenuous
BP's (SBP in the 80's). Prior to [**2107-10-27**] it looks like his
sBP's have been running in the 100's but since the new year he
has been living in the 90's. Given his low EF, critical AS and
dehydration he is being admitted to the CCU for fluid
resuscitation and close monitoring.
.
Of note he had shingles during last hospitalization and was put
on valcyclovir; he still c/o some residual intermittent pain on
his L flank and back. Currently denies CP, SOB, abdom pain, F/C,
D/C, N/V. Does report [**Month (only) **]'d PO intake recently; has been taking
all his Rx as directed.

IMAGING:
-[**3-30**] Renal US:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.7 cm and the left kidney
measures 9.9 cm. No hydronephrosis or mass is seen in either
kidney. No obstructing stone is present. Several echogenic foci
in the renal sinus fat bilaterally may represent vascular
calcifications. The bladder is moderately well distended and
appears normal.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal ultrasound. No hydronephrosis.

-[**2108-4-2**] Cardiac Catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
showed
three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had 30% stenosis.
The LAD
was patent with evidence of competative flow indicating a patent
LIMA.
The Lcx had a 90% origin stenosis. The RCA was occluded.
2. Resting hemodynamics showed normal RVEDP of 5 mmHg and mild
LVEDP of
17 mmHg. There was mild PAHTN with PASP of 34/12 mmHG. There was
severe
AS with calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.59 cm2. There was normal cardiac
index of
2.5 L/min/m2.
3. Successful closure of left femoral arteritomy (has right
fem-[**Doctor Last Name **]
bypass) with 8F angioseal.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease including
unrevascularized
ostial Lcx disease.
2. Patent LIMA
3. Severe AS
4. Successful aortic valvuloplasty with two inflations of 22mm
Tyshak II
balloon.
5. Successful LFA angioseal.
6. If recurrent symptoms, CoreValve
7. Consider Lcx PCI
