patient recently seen in ER on [**4-8**] treated for sinus infxn,
with congestion, nonproductive cough and asthma exacerbation
with augmentin and prednisone, although did not start prednisone
secondary to agitation, and called her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-10**] because of

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2159-4-10**] 11:59
Bilateral symmetric air space opacities are most consistent with
pulmonary edema. However, in the setting of patient's underlying
HIV, infectious etiologies could also be considered.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2159-4-11**]  12:38:06 AM
Sinus tachycardia
Probable inferior myocardial infarction, age indeterminate - may
be old
Low precordial lead QRS voltages - is nonspecific
Anterior myocardial infarct, age indeterminate
Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities - cannot exclude in
part ischemia
Clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2158-12-27**], sinus tachycardia, precordial
lead Q waves and further ST-T wave changes present.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2159-4-12**] 2:29 PM
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, as clinically questioned.
2. Extensive ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs. This
appearance most likely represents pulmonary edema, although
cannot exclude superimposed infection. Peripheral nodular
densities may represent focal atalecasis. Recommend follow up
imaging after appropriate treatment.
3. Chronic occlusion of left subclavian vein.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2159-4-12**] 3:45 AM
Improving of pulmonary edema which still is of at least moderate
degree.
.
ECHO [**2159-4-12**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is >20 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal
(LVEF 70%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2153-8-6**], no gross or
obvious change, but the technically suboptimal nature of both
studies precludes definitive comparison. The pulmonary artery
pressure could not be determined owing to the technically
suboptimal nature of this study.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2159-4-13**] 10:14 AM
Resolving alveolar edema.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2159-4-14**] 6:18 PM
Central vascular congestion with mild edema. Overall continued
slight improvement although not completely resolved.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2159-4-16**] 4:10 PM
Rapidly improving diffuse ground-glass attenuation and
resolution of previously described focal nodular opacities.
Considering interval diuresis, these findings are likely due to
hydrostatic edema.
.
However, differential diagnosis for diffuse ground glass
opacities is broad; in the appropriate clinical setting,
pulmonary hemorrhage, hypersensitivity reaction (to drug or
other antigens) and infection (viral or PCP) should also be
considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 F with pmhx of HIV, HepBC, asthma, morbid obesity presented
initially with shortness of breath.
.
# Dyspnea, hypoxic respiratory failure
Presented with fever, shortness of breath, and cough; had (and
continues to have) marked hypoxemia. PE ruled out with CTA. She
was empirically treated for pneumonia given her infiltrates
(these actually seem more consistent with alveolar edema) and
fever with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. No diagnostic sputum
culture data, as her specimen was inadequate. PCP had been
entertained, but sputum cx was a poor specimen, and this was
unlikely in setting of robust CD4 count. The most likely
explanation was pulmonary edema, supported by bilateral alveolar
infiltrates on chest xray, ground glass opacities on CT, and her
interval clinical and r
